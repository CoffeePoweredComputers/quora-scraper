            "answer_text": "I\u2019m descended from a batch of them. That experience morphed into our more recent experience with ethnic cleansing. No one I\u2019m related to on that side still claims to be Serb. Everyone who did was slaughtered for it. I\u2019m one of the last of my kind. The reason I figured out who I was that I went to investigate why black Americans were far more familiar to me than anyone else, and why I chose to marry into a black family and community. THERE IS COMMONALITY HERE. That concept is vigorously discouraged in America, and that is a fundamental cornerstone in the construction of American racism. If we fully embraced and reverenced our commonality THERE COULD BE NO RACISM. That\u2019s why the concept of \u2018white slaves\u2019 has been dismissed and construed as heresy. I don\u2019t see anyone mentioning peonage slavery. Jim Crow sharecropping is now commonly considered a form of peonage slavery. Americans are familiar with how difficult an experience that was. The peonage slavery that existed in Europe was similar. It varied in intensity in time and place. The peonage in Turkish-occupied Serbia was very harsh. The testimony of a Serb against a Turk was inadmissible in court. That was also the situation in American chattel slavery, and continued de facto into Jim Crow sharecropping. There was also the \u2018blood levy.\u2019 Every fifth eight-year-old boy was taken from his family. Most were turned in janissaries, soldiers who often returned to harass their own people, whom they no longer claimed as their own. Many girls were also taken for use in harems. Nearly all European countries had some form of peonage. In Russia it was so extensive the majority of the population were peons. In Russian literature you will often find references in which former Russian peons describe their experience as \u2018slavery.\u2019 To this day, any child studying English will be required to read \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin.\u201d Their first book in English. Taking that form of slavery into account it becomes apparent that the majority of European immigrants to this country were recent escapees from that form of slavery. The American premise that this is an experience white people can\u2019t understand is preposterous. It\u2019s part of the perverse thinking that defines racial \u2018identity\u2019 in America. Any form of racism relies on polarization. That\u2019s why this reality is denied. Racism requires that black and white people never feel they have this element in common, because then they would be equals, and the whole structure of white supremacy would fall down like a house of cards.

            "answer_text": "In Roman times, yes. However, it\u2019s not the same. The Romans enslaved countless numbers of Celts and Barbarians, whom they described as very tall and blonde (which was an exotic thing in Roman times). The Romans didn\u2019t assume a person of a certain color was not subject to slavery. They simply said \u201cThey\u2019re not Roman which means they\u2019re barbarians\u201d and went at it, whether they were in Northern Africa, Jerusalem or Britannia. They were usually however only taken during war, after a battle. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the slavery system in Roman times was highly regulated. Although the beginnings of a person\u2019s slavery were indeed horrible, over time you got increased legal protection including the right to complain against your masters. The Stoic philosophical school pushed for and got a lot of laws around good treatment of slaves and the state could put a \u201cpatron\u201d in prison for violating them. A skilled slave was allowed to work separately and keep their own money as their own property, which meant you could buy your freedom by buying a new, \u201cyounger\u201d slave for their master and doing an exchange. The master usually did not refuse an offer of a free younger slave. After, many slaves kept more equitable relationships with their former masters, depending on how they had been treated. Romans even allowed freed slaves to become Roman Citizens with full protection (at the lowest roman citizenship level, a \u201clibertus\u201d). The libertus\u2019 children were full Romans with full rights. This is because Romans sometimes took entire populations into slavery, including their learned peoples and even their nobles and kings. They used differently-skilled slaves for different purposes. It was common to see slaves in the market unchained, purchasing stuff for their household; doing highly skilled labor (as I mentioned) and keeping some of the money as agreed upon with their master; doing all sorts of things without wanting to escape. Slavery in ancient Rome describes the system well. So although the systems went by the same name, Roman slavery was markedly \u201cbetter\u201d than what was practiced by the European powers centuries later upon the African population they enslaved. A Roman Stoic, used to slavery as a system, would have been appalled to watch the movies Amistad and 12 Years a Slave, for example, and would have muttered \u201cthis is just not how you treat people!\u201d just the same. And would have considered the (\u201cwhite\u201d) slavers, well, Barbarians not just in national origin but also in attitude. We get the meaning of Barbarism as \u201cextreme cruelty or brutality\u201d today because the Romans saw the \u201cBarbarians\u201d treatment of others and started applying the term in that way. We seldom think about the fact that the Romans were referring to people like the Franks, the Bretons, The Angles and the Visigoths, whose descendants would call themselves \u201cwhite\u201d and create the model of slavery that we are familiar with today, as \u201cBarbaric\u201d people with no civilization and no morals. But it seems they had a point. Look what happened to the system of slavery once these Barbarians took over Europe. ",

            "answer_text": "There have been many fine answers, and I won\u2019t repeat them. But I did not see the most shocking fact of all: that whites were also slaves, along with blacks, in the antebellum South. And I am not referring to the practice of indentured servitude, which morphed into chattel slavery in the 17th century. John Punch, you may remember, had escaped from his indentured servitude in Maryland, and, caught in Virginia, was punished there . . . to serve for life. That was in 1640. In 1655, another African, John Casor, bolted from service to a Mr. Anthony Johnson \u2014 also of African descent \u2014 on the grounds that he believed his period of service was up. He indentured himself to another man, Robert Parker, but Johnson sued, and was rewarded with Casor for life. And so began a new period of slavery in America \u2014 for slavery among the Indians was not at all uncommon, was indeed quite ancient. This is just to show that the origin of slavery amongst white English-speaking populations in America was not racial, exactly, since the Johnson-Parker lawsuit that put Casor into lifelong servitude also established that free blacks could also own slaves. And continued to, until emancipation. A more racialized institution of slavery did evolve in the South, of course. Thomas Sowell explains why the racism element came to dominate \u2014 how else to justify slavery in a country where \u201call men are created equal\u201d? Blacks were said to be less than human. A convenient yet even then not very convincing explanation \u2014 self-interest can drive people to \u201cbelieve\u201d all sorts of nonsense. But here is a hitch. White men, particularly slave owners, were not immune to the temptations of the flesh. There were many \u201cbright\u201d babies among the slaves, for slave-owners and other white men raped (and, I guess, sometimes seduced) slave women, lightening up the skins of many descendent slaves. And this carried on for a long time, till the point that slavery could not be determined by looking at a person\u2019s skin \u2014 even in areas that had outlawed free blacks \u2014 but only by recourse to slave rolls, specifically records of births and motherhood. You have heard of the \u201cone drop rule,\u201d no? Have you read Mark Twain\u2019s Pudd\u2019nhead Wilson? The Twain story features a slave who was in servitude not because of his looks, but because of his 1/32nd black ancestry . . . but switched at birth with a white boy. So the story features a white slave as well as a free white man with just a small fraction of fairly recent (as opposed to our common \u201cout of Africa\u201d) African \u201cblood\u201d \u2014 who technically, legally \u201cshould\u201d have been the slave. There were many slaves who looked white and would have been considered white then (as well as now) were it not for the pesky, well-kept records of Southron slave owners. And many of these white slaves were liberated with the Emancipation Proclamation, and more, later, with the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution. So, yes, there have been white slaves, definitely were \u2014 even in the Confederate States of America. ",

            "answer_text": "The use of the word \u201cwhite\u201d in the question suggests that maybe most answers aren\u2019t looking at this in the way intended. Slavery in some form has existed probably at least since the existence of the first states with professional armies, about five to six thousand years ago. The main original source of enslavement was capture in war. But the modern form of slavery in the Americas with people of African ancestry was a racialized form of slavery. That is, an ideology was spun out to justify the enslavement as a permanent condition due to the alleged biological inferiority of the people who were enslaved. Europeans were probably never subjected to a racialized form of slavery like this. At least, none of the answers point to any. However, that said, the form of racialized lifetime slavery as an inherited condition for people of African ancestry in North America did evolve out of an earlier non-racialized form of slavery used by the English colonizers in North America. That happened because a peculiar feature of British colonization in North America was the use of large numbers of European slaves. The percentage of Europeans brought to North America as slaves (bond-servants) varied, from maybe 20 percent in New England to 80 percent in Virginia (the latter estimate from historian Philip Foner). Their circumstances of life after they were freed were also not especially rosy. According to one study (mentioned by historian Gary Nash), about 80 percent spent the rest of their lives as tenant farmers, hired farm laborers, or drunks and vagabonds. Due to the enclosures in England, where the entrepreneurial landowners and farmers were kicking peasants off their traditional lands and denying them their traditional feudal rights, by the 1500s and 1600s there were huge numbers of unemployed people tramping the roads in England. In about 1550 leaders of parliament first suggested enslaving them as lifetime slaves. This was opposed as too extreme to get political support. But in 1597 a Vagrancy Act was passed that did allow the authorities to round up any unemployed person, and put them into a forced labor regime for specified period of servitude. They were often branded with an \u201cS\u201d or \u201cV\u201d. In the early 1600s with the founding of the English colonies in North America these people were being shipped to North America and sold to plantation owners. They were called \u201cbond servants\u201d \u2014 bound in service to a master. They were chattel slaves. They could be sold. They were not paid wages. They could be whipped. Females were often raped. But the laws required they be set free after seven years of enslavement. So it was not a lifetime, inherited condition. The first Africans that came to North American in 1619 were simply integrated into this system. Not treated differently. That\u2019s because slavery at that time was not yet racialized or based on skin color. That didn\u2019t happen til the early 1700s. Due to various revolts in which the African and European slaves cooperated, the plantation class decided on a divide and conquer strategy of creating a worse condition for the African slaves, and they started a campaign of racialized disparagement of them due to allegedly being an uncivilized group. They then made their condition life time and inherited. This was also highly profitable for the landowners because they could buy a lifetime slave for the same price as a European bond-servant (who they had to free after seven years). And they would have their children for free. The systems of racialized forms of enslavement in the Americas grew out of European conquest, and were part of a strategy of dividing up the various groups of the subordinate population, and increasing their profits from the venture. But it\u2019s not possible to understand how the later system of racialized slavery came into existence without keeping in mind the older non-racial form of slavery it grew out of. ",

There were all kinds of slaves. The greatest Admiral in the world, \u201cZheng he\u201d was a slave. Ruling estates had been slaves, Greece, and Rome had slaves of white people, but what we identify the most as slavery is called \u201cchattle slavery\u201d and this was seen in the Atlantic slave trade. All the latter choices were different, they were taken care of, and fed well. However the Atlantic slave trade was suppose to help the economy of Europe, and with the lack of manpower over in the Americas they needed slaves, so they trade prisoners from Africa(prisoners which again were not \u201cchattle slaves\u201d) in exchange for guns and rum. They couldn\u2019t conquer Africa yet because it was so densely populated. Over time the Europeans needed a way to justify this mass slavery,so they came up with the idea of blacks as lower lifeforms that Caucasians. They also tied it in with Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution as a type of psuedo science. It was called \u201csocial-Darwinism\u201d and given that it still affects us today, the Atlantic slave trade was by far the worst thing that could happen. By the time slavery was outlawed, that had been the main support of Africa\u2019s economy, so all of the tribes started fighting for resources when the economy crashed, and the Europeans came in to take what they can get while Africa was weakened in \u201cthe scramble for Africa\u201d  There were also atrocities committed after slavery ended, like the Belgian Congo, and present day atrocities. Hence why people make a big deal about slavery in America. ",

            "answer_text": "What made the slavery in the new world unique is that overtime it became racial. That is not a distinctive trait of slavery throughout history, most countries that enforced slavery weren\u2019t particularly racist and didn\u2019t discriminate their slaves according to race. Race played a trick on slavery in the Americas: once the blacks only were enslaved (it didn\u2019t start that way), the obvious consequence was that all blacks became slaves too, or at least were perceived as slaves. Which meant that slavery became hereditary and basically impossible to resolve. By comparison, a slave in the Roman times could be of any origin (although a citizen could not sell himself or his family into slavery, but a non citizen Latin or otherwise Italian could), and a person could sell himself or his family into slavery only for a certain number of years, or could repay his owner and buy himself and his family out, or also could be easily emancipated (many rich Romans would leave a will that included emancipation for all of their slaves). A slave could also own a business (although he owed his or her master a part of the income) and profit from it. Once emancipated the former slaves could not become citizens, they became liberti, but their children could become citizens, as long as they were not born into slavery. Up until the XVIII century, in the US at least, the slaves included a certain number of whites, usually indentured workers or inmates. Indenture was a peculiar institution: the individual workers or whole families sold themselves, usually for a 7 year term. After this term they become free again. Early black slaves included a number of indentured workers as well, but while indenturing became less and less frequent among the British, for the blacks it became more and more binding to the point that in many states blacks could not be free men and women. This made the peculiarity of the slave system in the US and in the rest of the Americas, but that was a totally unusual system that didn\u2019t exist anywhere else. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, and even quite extensive! It is estimated, that the unthing of slavery was present since the beginning of mankind. The Egyptians had slaves, the Greek had slaves and the Roman empire is infamous for them! And to a surprising fact: many of them had been \u201cwhite\u201d! The Romans had slaves from all around their empire and there had been many skin colours, that this includes white people. They have been likely more \u201cwhite\u201d than ever, as they had been captured Gauls, Celts, Germans and the Picts who all have been coming from the North of Europe or Central Europe. Several authors mentioned their white skin which was regarded exotic and mysterious back then. The number of slaves dropped in the middle ages a bit, as a result of the fall of the Roman empire, but was recharged when the muslims tried to conquer Europe in the now Spanish areas, Italian coasts and Byzanz, what is now Istanbul. Muslims weren't allowed to take another muslim as slave, but that didn`t count for Christians and Jews and so they slain many of the Christian men, but captured many white women and sold them as sex slaves into the North African and Arabian world. There are inferior stories about the Harems and the fate of those white women. And it still continues today! ISIS, Boko Haram and the Taliban captured many girls and use them as sex slaves. Mainly muslims, but they don't care about skin colour and confession, when the victims aren't muslim. And you don't have to forget the labory slavery that you can find anywhere in the world. Also in the US and Europe, but even more in Africa and Asia.  ",

            "answer_text": "For the first few tens of thousands of years, humans enslaved those people who lived close enough with them to compete with them for food, water, land, and other natural resources. Your slaves might come from the next valley over instead of another continent - because it was way too hard to travel that far and bring back living slaves - transportation by land is hard when you're walking everywhere, even if you have pack animals. Domestication of animals took time... Slaves were not of your family, clan, tribe, city, or ethnic/language group - however that was defined at the time. Sometimes men would bring home wives from another culture (especially traders, as I'm going to assume that this was the oldest way of getting someone who knew the language & culture of the group that might be a potential trade partner and keeping those relationships cordial - since the trading houses would have literally traded children to marry into each other's families). Sometimes a traveling trader or even a raider might stick around and settle down with a \"local girl\" - depending again on the time & place. The early Germanic tribes, early British peoples, the people who would become the French, and so forth would have been enslaving each other - the Egyptians enslaved black and the various Semitic peoples who were their neighbors, the Romans enslaved the Greeks, the Greeks enslaved each other, and so forth & so on until transportation & trade for centuries before it got to the point where African tribes could capture neighbors and sell them to Arab slave traders who would take them to various ports to ship to places like Ancient Rome and more recently (say for the last four out of five centuries) Europe and then the Western Hemisphere. Slaves were the forerunners of machinery - since there were no machines and someone had to keep animals on task when muscle power or running water (grist mills for grinding grain into flour) were the only options for getting a task done - since no steam power, no electricity, and certainly no internal combustion engines - then someone had to be assigned that job. Children or slaves might be the ones set to watching animals, doing farm labor, spinning wool or linen, and any of the other host of tasks that have now been relegated to paid employees - many of them using machinery of some kind. This was a very different world back then - nothing could be automated because they hadn't invented the tools to develop the tools to build anything that would work that way. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course there have been white slaves. The Vikings routinely used to raid Britain and Ireland to capture slaves and sell them wherever they could get the best price. They also had a thriving business in capturing large numbers of Slavic people in Russia and the Ukraine and selling them down the river in the slave markets of the Middle East. (Slav -> Slave, note the derivation of the word). The Vikings got a particularly good price for redheads and blondes in the Arab slave markets. There is a record of a red-haired Irish girl being sold to an Arab sheikh for an extremely high price. Vikings even sold each other as slaves whenever they got the chance. It was a highly competitive business. North African Muslims also conducted extensive slave raids all along the Mediterranean coasts and across Christian Europe even as far north as the British Isles. They captured millions of white slaves and sold them in Muslim countries. Barbary pirates captured slaves from Europe and, to an extent, North America, from the 16th to 19th centuries, until the US and British Navies brought it to a stop. Remember the line from the Marines' Hymn, \u201cTo the shores of Tripoli\u201d? That refers to the First Barbary War when the US Marines acted to put a stop to the North African slave trade in white slaves. Of course, the Muslim pirates on the Barbary Coast were trading in black slaves as well, but they didn\u2019t discriminate on the basis of color. In all, Arab slave traders captured about 200 million slaves of all races, colors, and religions. Under Islamic laws, slavery was explicitly permitted, and Saudi Arabia, for instance, only abolished slavery in 1962 under pressure from Britain. ISIS is still capturing and selling slaves to this day. ",

He signed an indentured servitude contract in exchange for passage to Boston. After other passengers had departed, the ship\u2019s captain took him and the other servants to market to auction off their contracts. The couple who bought my great great grandfather\u2019s contract owned a leather works business where they proceeded to put him to work. This was not the expected step up from Manchester\u2019s factories, but Massachusetts law had very stiff penalties for running away from your contractual master. Aside from voluntarily entering the contract and receiving the agreed upon compensation, the situation was hardly distinguishable from slavery. Took several years for him to plan an escape by which he could quickly leave Massachusetts. He eventually made his way to Ohio where he apprenticed to an architect, learned the trade and married my great great grandmother. ",

            "answer_text": "There's already been a few answers talking about feudal serfdom and the like, but I'll just mention that there was a time when there were white \u201cracial\u201d slaves. The idea of captured people becoming slaves is a very old concept, but to have it be passed onto children, to my knowledge, only started coming around Roman times. Romans had this idea you see, you were either. Roman citizen, or you were a \u201csavage\u201d or \u201cbarbarian\u201d. Until you were a citizen, you didn't get many rights and the law wouldn't really defend you. If you were owned by a Roman citizen, they got basically do what they wanted to you, and that includes your kids. Where was this applied? Conquered territories mostly. That includes white Europe, northern Africa , bits of Spain and the Arab world, etc. If your parents were Roman, you could be counted as a Roman citizen, you could vote and get government jobs, run for senate, buy land, whatever. If you were a savage, unless you were \u201cfreed\u201d by someone important, you couldn't do much legally. Why did this only really start with Romans? Long story short, empires prior to this didn't really last that long. Empires lasting more than a generation (therefore conquered enemies living with your free people lasting more than a generation) are pretty rare. Also, some empires were weird, they believed they were \u201cunique\u201d or \u201cnoble\u201d, by having \u201ckinda\u201d slaves. Like Assyria had \u201cdebt\u201d slaves (work till debt of you or your kin is paid), Persia (sorta) banned slaves, and Greece had some weird rules, but they did have born slaves (children of slaves = new slave).

            "answer_text": "Oh yeah, all throughout history, there were slaves of every race, and lots of different kinds of slaves too. Like, with serfdom, the person was bought and sold as a part of the land, and there were certain rights that serfs did and didn\u2019t have. American slavery was chattel slavery, and for most of its history, was exclusively black. Black people could own slaves, but white people could not be slaves. The original reason for this is Christianity. In the triangle slave trade, the Americas produced sugar, tobacco, and cotton, but had a great demand for cheap labor. Europe wanted these products, and had advanced technology to trade. And then there was Africa. They traded guns to countries in West Africa, and the rapid advancement in weapons technology destabilized the region. Meaning they had a lot of slaves, which they could sell, and buy more guns, to protect themselves from their neighbor\u2019s who wanted to conquer and enslave them and sell them for more guns. These slaves would solve America\u2019s need for cheap labor, completing the trade cycle. Except for one problem. Western Europeans (and the American colonists) were very anti-slavery at the time. Europe had just gone through a series of revolts, spanning over a century, that slowly abolished one form of slavery after another. So, the merchants needed a marketing ploy. And that marketing ploy was Jesus. They told people that these Africans were savages that didn\u2019t know about God, and so by buying them and teaching them, they would be saving their eternal souls. Of course, I doubt most people really bought this. But it was enough of a moral excuse that business owners could use slaves without having their customers refuse to buy from them on moral grounds. In the beginning, there were other \u201csavage\u201d people who were slaves as well, such as the natives of the americas, but white people werent slaves because white people already knew about Christianity. Over time people\u2019s opinions shifted from \u201cthey\u2019re savage from ignorance, they\u2019re people just like us if we teach them\u201d to \u201cthey are savage and inferior by nature, it\u2019s just who they are\u201d. And that\u2019s where modern racism originates. A 500-year-old marketing ploy. ",

            "answer_text": "There were millions of `white` slaves in Europe as late as 1861 I\u2019m talking about the end of serfdom and emancipation reform in Russian Empire initiated by the Emperor Alexander II. Serfs in Russia were no different from slaves: they could be sold, separated from their families, killed with virtually no punishment, sexually abused, had no property rights. If they ran away, they were searched out by the government, returned to the owner and branded. Outright slavery, which in practice was no different than serfdom, was outlawed in Russia in 1723, when Peter the Great, converted household slaves into serfs. The difference between the statuses was in legal paperwork only. Not only did serfdom flourish in Russia among nobles, government and the church were large beneficiaries of it as well. The official estimate is that 10.5 million Russians were privately owned, 9.5 million were in state ownership and another 900,000 serfs were under the Tsar's patronage (udelnye krestiane) before the Great Emancipation of 1861. Another \u201cinteresting\u201d stat: By the mid-19th century, the peasants composed a majority of the population, and according to the census of 1857 the number of private serfs was 23.1 million out of 62.5 million Russians or 37.7% of the population.  One of the most famous works of Russian literature is called \u201cDead souls\u201d it specifically refers to the practice of selling and buying people, the machinations around it and the lives of parasitic nobles, who benefited from it.  One interesting practice and in fact a law that existed around 15th century was called \u201cYur\u2019ev Day\u201d or \u201cSt. George\u2019s Day\u201d . At the end of the fall harvest there were two weeks when all serfs had an opportunity to change their owners. They could take their families and possessions and move to either another landowner who had a reputation of being more fair or leave for freer parts of Russia that didn\u2019t have serfdom - in the North, Ural or Siberia. However the practice was ended by Boris Godunov, as many nobles didn\u2019t like it. To this day there is a saying in Russian \u201cSo much for Yur\u2019ev Day, babushka\u201d - it refers to broken promises. P.S.: I am a descendant of Russian serfs from southern Russia. In fact easily 80% of modern Russian population are, due to the effects of Russian Civil War, Bolshevik rule of terror and WWI & WWII, that decimated Russian population.

            "answer_text": "I highly recommend reading this entry: Arab slave trade - Wikipedia Here is the relevant part: \u201c(\u2026) The North African slave markets traded also in European slaves. The European slaves were acquired by Barbary pirates in slave raids on ships and by raids on coastal towns from Italy to Spain, Portugal, France, England, the Netherlands, and as far afield as Iceland. Men, women, and children were captured to such a devastating extent that vast numbers of sea coast towns were abandoned. Ohio State University history Professor Robert Davis describes the white slave trade as minimized by most modern historians in his book Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500-1800 (Palgrave Macmillan) (\u2026)\u201d Moveover, when reading about slavery you also need to be familiar with the concept of serfdom. It had the same role as slavery with regards to supplying free labor for land owners and (legally) restricting rights of a class of people - the peasants. Serfdom - Wikipedia Interestingly in some parts of Europe serfdom lasted until as late mid 19th century, about the same time slavery was finally abolished in USA! Here is an attempt to compare 19th century slavery and serfdom. The author says among all this: \u201c(\u2026) According to Jan Sowa the only difference between serfdom in Eastern and Central Europe and slavery as we know it from the Americas was that people were not sold individually, which means that members of families were not separated from each other. This does not mean however that there was no human trafficking. There was but it was a wholesale trade \u2013 villages were sold en bloc with all their population.

            "answer_text": "Here is a brief comparative analysis of various cultures throughout history which shows that slavery is not only immoral but also economically degenerate - be it European, African, Arab, or American. Slavery had been halting the economic development of humanity throughout most of its history, and only the abandonment of slavery (and, to an extent, of serfdom) resulted in rapid economic, cultural, and political advancement. Those cultures that continued to practice slavery held themselves back, and now they claim that they are somehow the victims of the more advanced, non-slave cultures. I wrote this a while ago as a counterargument to the widespread claim that America has become rich through slavery and the theft of land - comparing the U.S. to other nations that stole lands and practiced slavery but remain poor today. I\u2019ll start with this one-paragraph summary of human history: for many thousands of years the world\u2019s wonderful cultures had been at each other\u2019s throat, engrossed in feuds, rape, pillaging, slavery, theft of the neighbors\u2019 resources, torture, murder, treachery, corruption, assassinations, and cannibalism. From the beginning of time, human history was a never-ending string of wars, famines, diseases, exploitation, poor hygiene, high infant mortality, and an average life expectancy of about 30 years. The world was mostly run by either ignorant witch doctors or ruthless tyrants who went to war for personal enjoyment, constructing pyramids out of the skulls of slain enemies. If land theft and slave labor is what makes countries rich, why isn\u2019t Turkey the richest nation in the world?People had been migrating all the time, moving to other lands and continents, setting up colonies and empires without asking permission from the natives, who often assimilated into one nation with the conquerors. The latest example is the Turkish Ottoman Empire whose conquest of heavily populated countries in Europe and the Middle East was happening simultaneously with the colonization of the sparsely populated Americas by the Europeans. The Turks had come from far-away lands, stole the entire Asia Minor from the Christian natives, renamed their cities, and settled on their land for good. As the Americans fought a war against slavery, the Ottoman Empire continued to grow and expand its slave trade, bordering simultaneously on Austria, Morocco, Poland, Sudan, and Persia. The number of people killed, enslaved, converted, and driven from their land was much greater in the Ottoman Empire than in the entire Western hemisphere. Where is the outcry and demands of reparations? Ask yourself a question: if land theft and slave labor is what had made America so rich, why isn\u2019t Turkey the richest country in the world? As opposed to the bare lands and deserts of the New World, the Turks conquered cradles of ancient civilizations with turn-key cities and pre-existing infrastructure. However, apart from oil deposits, the formerly Ottoman lands remain dirt-poor, with Turkey itself not far away in the lead. But let\u2019s not single out the Turks. Before them were the Mongols, who made no distinction between the civilians and the army, and whose conquest had lead to the creation of the world\u2019s largest empire ruled by fear and iron discipline. How many millionaires does Mongolia have today? And before that were the Arabs who came as conquerors from the Arabian Peninsula, stole all of North Africa and Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) from the Christian natives, forcibly converted them to Islam, and settled on their land for good. And before them there had been conquests by the Huns, the Chinese, the Celts, the Greeks, the Romans, the Goths, the Persians, the Slavs, and many others who settled on other people\u2019s lands simply because they could. All cultures practiced slavery in one way or another. It stopped in Europe around the Middle Ages but continued to thrive in Africa, Asia, and in the Middle East. Through the contacts between the Arabs and the Portuguese it was reintroduced to Europe and the Americas. Although the European and American abolitionists eventually brought an end to slavery and slave trade on their territories, it still exists in various ugly forms in other parts of the world. To get a glimpse of the thousand-year-old dark historical reality, look no further than Sudan where even today Arabs are practicing a racist form of slavery. Black African villages of Darfur are being ransacked, men and women killed and raped, their children taken away as slaves (and also raped repeatedly). Nothing can be done now to change the ugly past, but something can and should be done to change the fate of black slaves today. Only the activists and \u201ccommunity leaders\u201d who would be expected to initiate such actions are so busy fuming over the suffering of black slaves in America seven generations ago that they have no time for the suffering of black slaves in today\u2019s Sudan. Could it be because their real concern has never been the suffering of black slaves \u2013 but rather finding an excuse to trash the United States? Another huge slaving outpost waiting to be freed is, of course, North Korea. Why aren\u2019t there any calls from the \u201cprogressive\u201d camp to abolish a form of neo-slavery called socialism? Why did the \u201cprogressives\u201d call the USSR a \u201cworkers\u2019 paradise\u201d when it was being built by slave labor in concentration camps? If slavery is a certified path to prosperity, why didn\u2019t half a century of suffering and millions of lives wasted in the gulag make the Soviet Union richer \u2014 but the new economic freedom did, despite the botched reforms and the ubiquitous government corruption? China had emulated the Soviet slave-labor economy with an even bigger army of political prisoners \u2013 and with an equally disastrous outcome. But when the Communist rulers abandoned slave labor in favor of capitalist reforms, the economy started to grow \u2014 and so did the standard of living. If putting an end to slavery and giving people a small amount of freedom can bring forth such sizeable growth within only two decades in Russia and China, how much economic growth and prosperity can be achieved by a nation whose people have had two centuries of full economic and political freedom? Have all cultures already arrived at the final point in their development? To find the answer, look at a country that starts with \u201cUnited\u201d and ends with \u201cStates.\u201d And that\u2019s the end of the silly argument about America owing its prosperity to slave labor. The continent of North America was settled in several waves by Siberian hunters, each wave accompanied by the theft of land and conquest. In what bank is that stolen wealth kept today? The arriving Europeans discovered a collection of half-naked warrior tribes killing one another for land, water, game, wives, and simply as a sport \u2013 just like anywhere else in the world thousands of years ago. Only some cultures had grown out of it, others had never risen, yet others had gone over the hill and slid back into barbarism. This begs a question: by what measure do we determine which stage of cultural development is the correct one and deserving of being frozen in time? The multiculturalist dogma of the equality of all cultures raises even more questions. Have all cultures already arrived at the final point in their development? Is cultural achievement meaningless? Is the history of arts and sciences irrelevant? Is the complexity of social structure inconsequential? Is the respect for human dignity and individual rights an empty sound? Is there no difference between \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d on the stairwell of human progress? And if you believe all of that, can you still call yourself a \u201cprogressive\u201d and keep a straight face? History answers negatively to all those questions. World cultures aren\u2019t equal and never have been. Humanity is a living, breathing, and evolving organism that thrives on cultural interaction and development, in which cultures compete for survival \u2014 and yes, fight with each other \u2014 but also learn from the best. Today we are witnessing a major fight between two of the world\u2019s cultures, one of which \u2014 the Islamic fundamentalists \u2014 got stuck at the lower steps of societal evolution and would like to drag the rest of the world down to their level, so that there would be nothing left above their heads to distract true believers from focusing on their toenails and pondering existential issues such as the foot hygiene of airline passengers. If you listen to the \u201cprogressives\u201d and believe that all cultures are equal, you might as well not resist and descend to their level as John Walker Lindh did. If we want answers we shouldn\u2019t be stopping the pioneers. By the time you discover that the difference between \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d is not a fancy postmodernist notion, but a reality as essential as the difference between life and death, it may be too late. Not just for you but to those around you as well, within the kill radius of the shrapnel in your explosive belt. Equating our two cultures is not just unnatural \u2013 it\u2019s suicidal. We should consider ourselves lucky that a few generations ago Western nations managed to lift themselves out of the sewer in which humanity lived for thousands of years. These nations have mastered science, arts, medicine, increased life expectancy, and developed a legal system that grants more rights and freedoms to individual citizens than any other culture in history. The advancement is reciprocal: the more freedoms the individuals have, the better off the nation is economically. At the head of this upward movement is the United States, the first nation to put individual freedoms above the government\u2019s interests. Placing the government in the service of the people at an age when the rest of the world viewed the people as mere servants to their governments. The vertical map of the world\u2019s cultures is never a still picture; they are moving along the entire visible length of the stairwell of progress. The invisible flights of stairs are still ahead of us \u2013 a terra incognita. How far up does the stairwell go? Is there an end to it? How soon will humanity get there, and how much has already been covered? If we want answers we shouldn\u2019t be stopping the pioneers. We must celebrate them. As for the losers still down at the bottom, empathize with them all you want - but remember that you can afford this emotional luxury only because at least one part of humanity has found the ability to clean up their act and show the way to other nations - and a hope that one day, with the right attitude, the others may also climb out of the sewer.

            "answer_text": "Throughout ancient times most certainly, slavery has been around for a very long time. Ancient tribes and city states would enslave people captured in war and sometimes for debt, the Spartans kept a huge population of their fellow Greeks as Helots - like the later medieval bonded peasants but even more harshly treated - the Romans started by enslaving their fellow Italians but later branched out into enslaving the Gauls, Germans and Slavs they found on their borders. In early modern times we have Corsairs from the Barbary Coast - Morocco, the Saharan Coast to the south and across into Algeria - making regular slave raids into Europe, attacking Ireland, England and even Iceland. Some of the raiders were themselves European, like Suleiman Reis (Ivan de Veenboer, started as a Dutch Privateer, moved to Algiers), Jan Janszoon aka Murat Reis (also Dutch, rose to become President of the Republic of Sale, the cheif Corsair port in southern Morocco) and John Ward aka Jack Asfur aka the Sparrow (yes THAT Jack Sparrow), who worked out of Tunis. These bastards had no problem enslaving poor sods who had once been their countrymen, and from 1627 to 1632 Jan Janszoon occupied the English island of Lundy in the Bristol Channel and used it to keep captives before shipping them to North Africa. Though to be fair the earlier English occupiers, the de Mariscos, were a pretty bad lot and pirates themselves, and the Corsairs just got replaced by European privateers who were little better. In the 18th century one villainous character enslaved other Englishmen there. Must be something in the water. There was also at least one instance of Christian Dutchmen attempting to sell Portuguese prisoners to the English colonists of Barbados as slaves. The Dutch and Portuguese fought a pretty lively war in the 1630s, the Sugar War, over control of the north east coast of Brazil, and some enterprising spark from the VOC had the idea to offload his POWs for a profit. I don\u2019t know if the English took them, but they certainly had Irish indentured labourers a couple of decades later, who, while technically not slaves, weren\u2019t treated a great deal better for the term of their indenture. The Barbary pirates were still at it as late as the 19th century, though they were not taking slaves so much as capturing European and American ships crews and holding them for ransom. While the European powers were busy blowing each other to bits in the Napoleonic wars the US sent it\u2019s first overseas task force to the Barbary Coast in 1801 and a second in 1815 to at least stop the Beys of Tunis and Tripoli and the Dey of Algiers targeting American ships. So in summary, yes lots. ",

            "answer_text": "I have several patients who are or were slaves for over a number of years, sometimes many years. Every single one of them I met was or still is working in the sex industrie. The vast majority of slaves I meet are native Dutch women and girls or sometimes foreign women from Eastern Europe, since these people are more likely to end up as my patient, though I have no doubt there are women from other regions as well or people forced to work in other sectors. These women were forced into this work by manipulation, threats, violence and dependence. They can not leave because they would be beaten, raped, threatened, pressured or tortured. They are isolated from their family and loved ones and emotionally broken. They do not trust the police, some do not speak the language. If foreign then their passports are taken from them. They are traded to other pimps and criminal organizations. They are often afraid to ask for help, and when they try to get out of their situation they are shunned and looked down on by other people because of their work and are denied regular jobs when an employer finds out about their past. There is a lot of judgement about these women in society which makes it very difficult for them to break free. Edit: Corinne Dettmeijer gave an interesting TedTalk about it:  Also: http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/region/europe/ (Estimated 17,500 slaves in the Netherlands alone. An estimated 1,243,400 slaves in the entire of Europe). ",

            "answer_text": "Of course their have been white slaves. Slavery is not immune to one person because of their race and has impacted the vast majority of races in this world. Following the collapse of Roman rule in Britain, Irish raiders raided Britain and brought home slaves to sell. The most famous victim of these raids has to be St. Patrick who was actually born in Wales. In the following centuries, Ireland would go through its golden age due to it\u2019s conversion of Christianity from paganism. Irish monks would preserve transcripts and wealth from Europe and keep them preserve in monasteries in Ireland. This would make Irish monasteries a very wealthy place and since monks would refused to have many weapons a easy place to raid with the first recorded viking raid in Ireland on 795. Word soon spread around Scandinavia and more raids were committed on monasteries in Great Britain and Ireland. By the late 9th and early 10th century, the Viking started settling the area around Dublin and by the 11th century, Dublin would became the biggest slave market in Western Europe. Due to the Viking settlement in Ireland, the vikings were able to take people in Ireland and either sell them or take them to Iceland in which they formed 40% of the founding population. \u201cWhen the Vikings established early Scandinavian Dublin in 841, they began a slave market that would come to sell thralls captured both in Ireland and other countries as distant as Spain, as well as sending Irish slaves as far away as Iceland, where Gaels formed 40% of the founding population, and Anatolia. In 875, Irish slaves in Iceland launched Europe's largest slave rebellion since the end of the Roman Empire, when Hj\u00f6rleifr Hr\u00f3\u00f0marsson's slaves killed him and fled to Vestmannaeyjar. Almost all recorded slave raids in this period took place in Leinster and southeast Ulster; while there was almost certainly similar activity in the south and west, only one raid from the Hebrides on the Aran Islands is recorded\u201d[1] According to genetic evidence, around 62% of he Icelandic maternal gene pool is derived from Ireland and Scotland. The Irish and the Scottish Gaels were either slaves or servants of the Norse chiefs, according to the Icelandic sagas \u201cFollowing Ing\u00f3lfur, and also in 874, another group of Norwegians set sail across the North Atlantic Ocean with their families, livestock, slaves, and possessions, escaping the domination of the first King of Norway, Harald Fairhair. They traveled 1,000 km (600 mi) in their Viking longships to the island of Iceland. These people were primarily of Norwegian, Irish or Gaelic Scottish origin. The Irish and the Scottish Gaels were either slaves or servants of the Norse chiefs, according to the Icelandic sagas, or descendants of a \"group of Norsemen who had settled in Scotland and Ireland and intermarried with Gaelic-speaking people\". Genetic evidence suggests that approximately 62% of the Icelandic maternal gene pool is derived from Ireland and Scotland, which is much higher than other Scandinavian countries, although comparable to the Faroese, while 37% is of Nordic origin. About 20-25% of the Icelandic paternal gene pool is of Gaelic origin, with the rest being Nordic\u201d[2] Footnotes[1] Slavery in Ireland - Wikipedia[2] Icelanders - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "Yes, slavery existed all over the world, people of all colors and ethnic groups have been enslaved at one point or another. All humans alive today are descended from people who were slaves or owned slaves at one point or another, most likely both. We are also all descended from cannibals. The word slave comes from the Latin \u201cslavonic\u201d which means captive but its referring specifically to Slavic people from Eastern Europe, they were caught is such numbers during a war in the 9th century, and spent so much time as slaves we use a word based on their ethnic group to describe the condition of slavery which is forced labor and captivity. Slavery is not unique to America neither is racism, and racism was not the cause of slavery. The first slaves sold in the US were Dutch. African slaves were brought to South America and the Caribbean in far greater numbers than to the Colonies and the reason African slaves were used is because there was already and still is a booming slave market in Africa. You can go to Africa specifically Libya right now and buy a slave for as little as $200 US. The NAZI\u2019s executed Jews, Poles, Czechs, and other \u201cundesirables\u201d en mass but they also took anyone who had a skill and used them as slave labor in conditions worse than concentration camps, literally working people to death because you could get useful labor out of them before you killed them. It does not matter if one Jewish watchmaker dies in a factory you have 50 more in concentration camps. The NAZI\u2019s didnt commit the largest genocide in history but they committed the most horrific. Slave labor was a huge part of it. As was the industrialization of mass murder. Most genocides are people being rounded up and slaughtered, that is horrific enough and happens far to often. The NAZI\u2019s were unsatisfied with old fashioned genocide, shooting multiple people with one bullet was not \u201ccost effective\u201d and \u201ctoo slow\u201d so they built and entire industry to slaughter human beings like cattle. Slave labor was a huge part of the NAZI war machine and almost all of the slaves were what people would call \u201cwhite\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "There were lots of white slaves. Most of the slaves in the mediterranean were white. And even in USA, there were times when there were more white than black slaves. I m refering to real slaves, who were property of their owner for lifetime and their children also property to be sold and traded. Tens of thousands of white slaves were also sold to Caribbean islands, especialy to Barbados and Jamaika, as plantation workers. The north African states send pirate ships to raid the coasts of Europe, up to Iceland and also North America to import especialy white female slaves to be sold in north african slave markets. One red haired girl. unknown origin, achieved the highest historicaly recorded price for a slave, which would igual today half a million dollars. And another white slave, Roxelane (recorded also being with red hair but from Poland) was abducted by Tatars and sold in Istanbul. The Osman Sultan Suleyman I bought her as sex slave, but fell in love with her and made her his first wife. She had sex children with the Sultan and her son, Selim, became the next Sultan Suleyman II. ",

            "answer_text": "In 1733 The Danish King made a law that the the nobility and the military had requested. The industrialization of Europe meant people were leaving rural areas and trying their luck for a wealthier life in the cities. The landowners feared this would cause them to lose the hands necessary for their agriculture. The law was called stavnsb\u00e5ndet in Danish and was a type of serfdom bonding men between the ages 18 to 36 to the area where they were born. There was a loophole allowing men to buy their way out of the trap. But since farmhands seldom had money to do that, it was only the very wealthy who could leave and seek employment and education elsewhere. The law was changed several times and by 1764 men between 4 and 40 years old could not leave the region where they were born unless they were ordered to do so as a soldier. This form of farm hands slavery was not fully abolished until 1800, and it is part of the reason why the industrialization of Denmark happened relatively late when compared to our neighbors. The military still had restrictions on the movement of men right until 1848. When stavnsb\u00e5ndet was abolished so was the nobles right to use tr\u00e6hest, hundehjul og halsjern and various other types of torture to punish the peasants. Tr\u00e6hest means wooden horse and it look something like this. People died without any form of court trial.  So to answer your question did white men get treated as slaves, they most certainly did. The reason why African slaves got transported to the Danish Virgin Islands was because Denmark was running out of convicts and unwanted to ship to the colonies. The survival rate of those that did manage to get there was abysmally low. Of the first attempt only a few lived to tell the tale. Of the second expedition 161 out of 190 were dead within 6 months. It was a different time and our modern concepts of right and wrong does not fit anywhere in the past. Stavnsb\u00e5nd - Wikipedia Stavnsb\u00e5ndet - Wikipedia, den frie encyklop\u00e6di Edit bonus fact: Denmark abolished slave trade in 1792. But in both the colonies and in mainland European Denmark people continued to live as slaves. Slavery was not banned on the Danish Virgin Islands until 1848. The same year where the Danish military stopped the last remnants of Stavnsb\u00e5ndet, and the young men could again freely leave the region they grew up in. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a small example of Roman slavery and numbers, though this is by no means all of the slavery statistics from the Romans. A great deal of slaves throughout Roman times were eastern and western Europeans. \u201cTo use modern terms, the Romans were \u201cequal opportunity\u201d enslavers: they did not limit their enslavements to one people, place, or, in our terms, race. From the late third century BCE through the early third century CE, as the Romans conquered the Mediterranean basin, the Balkans, much of the modern Middle East, Europe west of the Rhine River, they often enslaved at least some of their defeated enemies. Although the numbers given in ancient sources are notoriously unreliable, a few examples indicate the scale of capture and enslavement. In 177 BCE, during his campaign in Sardinia, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus killed or enslaved 80,000 of the island's inhabitants. In 167 BCE the Roman senate granted the victorious Roman general in Greece the right to sack seventy cities on the west coast of Greece: 150,000 persons were enslaved. Although the nearly continuous wars of expansion of the last two BCE came to an end under imperial Rome, the empire still waged wars and enslaved many of the conquered. To name a few, Augustus's wars against the Alpine tribes and in Spain, Tiberius's wars along the Rhine, Claudius's conquest of Britain, campaigns against the Parthians, Trajan's wars in Dacia, and Marcus Aurelius' campaign across the Danube all brought captives to Rome as slaves. Revolts in the provinces, though rarer, too, resulted in enslavements. In the Jewish War (in what is now Israel) in 66-70 CE, to take a dramatic example, 97,000 people were enslaved.\u201d Slavery was not only practiced by the Romans. Most peoples of Europe not only practiced in slavery but at one time were slaves themselves (tribes or peoples who were defeated in war.\u201d It was common practice in Europe since before recorded history to aquier slaves from a defeated enemy. It is assumed that this practice went on for quite so time before recorded history because of it being so wide spread when history was first starting to be recorded. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know what you're asking about, since you added \"I am not referring to the situational use of or perhaps enslavement of soldiers captured or any similiar situation.\" That's a lot to discount.  A large proportion of the population of ancient Rome were slaves. At some times, this was around 30% to 40% of the total population. These were mostly captured soldiers or civilians, but also debtors and some criminals. Slavery in ancient Rome had nothing to do with race.  Aside from Rome, there's plenty of evidence of slavery all over the world in prehistoric and ancient times:  \"In the earliest known records slavery is treated as an established institution. The Code of Hammurabi (ca. 1760 BC), for example, prescribed death for anyone who helped a slave to escape or who sheltered a fugitive.[32] The Bible mentions slavery as an established institution.\" [From Slavery, Wikipedia]\"Slavery was known in almost every ancient civilization, and society, including Sumer, Ancient Egypt, Ancient China, the Akkadian Empire, Assyria, Ancient India, Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, the Islamic Caliphate, the Hebrew kingdoms in Palestine, and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas.[10] Such institutions included debt-slavery, punishment for crime, the enslavement of prisoners of war, child abandonment, and the birth of slave children to slaves.\" [From Slavery, Wikipedia]Can you be more specific about what kind of slavery you're asking about, if you don't want to include ancient Rome. I'm also curious as to why you don't want to include this. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course there have been white slaves. At first, English tobacco and sugar plantations in Caribbean Islands like Barbados and Montserrat used African slaves for field labour. There was also a demand for indentured \u2018servants.\u2019 Of the servants who found themselves on Barbados, some were volunteers, some were felons or prisoners of war; some were English, others Scottish or Irish, a few were German, Dutch or even French. (Indeed, so many people were dispatched to the island that the term \u201cto be Barbadosed\u201d swiftly gained popular currency.) [1]  Image: Amazon.com: Sugar in the Blood: A Family's Story of Slavery and Empire The Irish were particularly plentiful because of the frequent food shortages, high unemployment and English military disruption in their homeland. In the 1650s their numbers were swollen further by a huge number of Irish prisoners of war; indeed, nearly 7,000 Irishmen were transported to the island during the Cromwellian period. [1] It was no longer \u2018servants\u2019, they were \u2018sold in perpetuity\u2019 to \u2018work in the fields\u2019. The outbreak of the rebellion in 1641 temporarily disrupted the Atlantic trade, but transportations resumed after Cromwell\u2019s invasion in August 1649. The first shipment occurred towards the end of that year, when, after the storming of Drogheda, Oliver Cromwell ordered the few surviving members of the garrison to be sent to Barbados. Over the coming years, thousands of military prisoners were sold in perpetuity to plantation-owners to work in the fields, effectively as slaves. Despite the departure of so many soldiers to the Continent at the end of the war, small Tory bands continued to pose a serious, if localised, military threat throughout the 1650s. Local parliamentary commanders usually executed captured Tories, or else arranged for them to be shipped to the Caribbean, along with those civilians accused of assisting them. [2]  Image: The Irish of Barbados (Photos) The woman pictured on the right is the great aunt of the singer, Rihanna As a result of the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, a number of white slaves were shipped to the Caribbean: \u2026841 of the Monmouth rebels to transportation servitude, not in New England or Virginia, where they might find a congenial climate and company, but in one of the West Indian Islands, toiling alongside African slaves. Macaulay says that at least one fifth of these convicts died and were thrown to the sharks before they reached the Caribbean, and many more died of disease before completing their ten-year sentence. Along with many others at court James\u2019s French queen was given the right to sell these slaves to their future West Indian owners, and she is said to have made 1,000 guineas on the transaction. Most of these West Country rebels went to Barbados, where their descendants still form a tenth of the island\u2019s population. Indeed, these white Barjans still speak with an antiquated \u2018Zummerzetshire\u2019 accent. [3] Thanks for your question.

The traditional story of Saint Patrick - Wikipedia, patron saint of Ireland, is that he was taken from Wales as a slave by Irish raiders and was six years tending sheep until he escaped. (Recent theories suggest Patrick may actually have been a slave-trader who absconded from Roman-Britain.) Pirate raids such as this were commonplace in the fifth century, as was the taking of slaves. White enslavement was in no way unusual, though it is surprising to learn as it does not conform to our usual concept of slavery inflicted on other races by white people. (This is not to suggest any equivalence in scale, brutality or dehumanisation which characterized the Atlantic slave trade.) ",

            "answer_text": "Many good answers concentrate on the enslavement of Europeans by North Africans, but it\u2019s as well to remember that throughout most of recorded history Europeans enslaved each other enthusiastically. The very word \u201cSlave\u201d is cognate with Slav, and entered currency because of the numbers of Slavic captives (mostly Moravian and Polish) that the Franks sold to their neighbours, chiefly the Byzantine Empire, during the early middle ages. The Vikings raided for slaves as much as anything else that wasn\u2019t nailed down, and large numbers of Frankish, English and Irish slaves turned up in their markets. Some they kept for their own use: DNA analysis of the Icelandic population shows that apart from Scandinavian descent, the other major genetic component is Irish. They didn\u2019t go there as tourists. Slavery in England was abolished in 1066 by William the Conqueror. Before that slaves had been drawn largely from the lower classes of the English and Danish inhabitants, and before that no doubt from Britons captured in war. In Ireland slave girls were at one point used as an accounting currency; the girls in question were mostly Irish, but there were some British slaves, like St. Patrick, and some Pictish. Going back a bit further, the Roman Empire ran on slave power. Some came from North Africa and the Middle East, but at least as many came, in the early days, from neighbouring Italian communities, and later from Spanish, Gaulish and Germanic communities which were unfortunate enough to get on the wrong side of the wrong General. The Greeks had a system in which if you captured an enemy city, you massacred the men of military age and sold everybody else, old men, women and children, into slavery. Most of the cities concerned were also Greek. We also know that the Gauls, Iberians and early Germans kept slaves, though we don\u2019t know a lot about their systems. But the slaves were almost certainly from neighbouring tribes. So yes. At most points in history there were \u201cwhite\u201d slaves. Millions of them. ",

The slavery of blacks in America was nothing new and wholly unexceptional. There were slave plantations in the Roman empire and the far East, for instance. The usual lot of victims of the Roman Empire was slavery - slavers famously travelled behind Roman armies. It was actually one way they paid for the armies. Vikings raided for slaves and sold them in the slave markets of Byzantium and elsewhere. White slaves may have ended up as far away as China. Stephen Jacob is factually incorrect about intergenerational slavery in America being unique. It was practised in Rome and elsewhere. Geoffrey Thorndyke covers the Barbary corsairs. ",

Even some Americans were enslaved. The African appetite for slaves was so large it had a devastating impact on some Europeans coastal cities. Pirates (called corsairs) from cities along the Barbary Coast in north African cities such as Tunis and Algiers would raid ships in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, as well as seaside villages to capture men, women and children. The impact of these attacks were devastating. France, England, and Spain each lost thousands of ships, and long stretches of the Spanish and Italian coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants. At its peak, the destruction and depopulation of some areas probably exceeded what European slavers would later inflict on the African interior.

            "answer_text": "Every race has been enslaved, yet 21st century discussions on slavery only emphasis on the Atlantic Slave Trade, There were hundreds of thousands of Scots sold into slavery during Colonial America. White slavery to the American Colonies occurred as early as 1630 in Scotland. , the Irish slaves were more plentiful in the English Empire, they were cheaper and treated far worse since they were Catholic, no thanks to Oliver Cromwell. If you go back far enough in history, you can find the dark pasts of every civilization and of every group of people The judges of Edinburgh Scotland during the years 1662-1665 ordered the enslavement and shipment to the colonies a large number of rogues and others who made life unpleasant for the British upper class. (Register for the Privy Council of Scotland, third series, vol. 1, p 181, vol. 2, p 101). The above accounting sounds horrific but slavery was what the Scots have survived for a thousand years. The early ancestors of the Scots, Alba and Pics were enslaved as early as the first century BC. Varro, a Roman philosopher stated in his agricultural manuscripts that white slaves were only things with a voice or instrumenti vocali. Julius Caesar enslaves as many as one million whites from Gaul. (William D Phillips, Jr. SLAVERY FROM ROMAN TIMES TO EARLY TRANSATLANTIC TRADE, p. 18).

            "answer_text": "Throughout ancient times most certainly, slavery has been around for a very long time. Ancient tribes and city states would enslave people captured in war and sometimes for debt, the Spartans kept a huge population of their fellow Greeks as Helots - like the later medieval bonded peasants but even more harshly treated - the Romans started by enslaving their fellow Italians but later branched out into enslaving the Gauls, Germans and Slavs they found on their borders. In early modern times we have Corsairs from the Barbary Coast - Morocco, the Saharan Coast to the south and across into Algeria - making regular slave raids into Europe, attacking Ireland, England and even Iceland. Some of the raiders were themselves European, like Suleiman Reis (Ivan de Veenboer, started as a Dutch Privateer, moved to Algiers), Jan Janszoon aka Murat Reis (also Dutch, rose to become President of the Republic of Sale, the cheif Corsair port in southern Morocco) and John Ward aka Jack Asfur aka the Sparrow (yes THAT Jack Sparrow), who worked out of Tunis. These bastards had no problem enslaving poor sods who had once been their countrymen, and from 1627 to 1632 Jan Janszoon occupied the English island of Lundy in the Bristol Channel and used it to keep captives before shipping them to North Africa. Though to be fair the earlier English occupiers, the de Mariscos, were a pretty bad lot and pirates themselves, and the Corsairs just got replaced by European privateers who were little better. In the 18th century one villainous character enslaved other Englishmen there. Must be something in the water. There has also been a minumum of one example of Christian Dutchmen selling Portuguese prisoners toward English colonists of Barbados as slaves. The Dutch and Portuguese fought a fairly lively war inside 1630s, the glucose War, over control over the north-east coastline of Brazil, and some enterprising spark through the VOC had the idea to offload their POWs for an income. We don\u2019t know if the English took all of them, however they undoubtedly had Irish indentured labourers a couple of years later on, whom, while officially perhaps not slaves, weren\u2019t addressed a great deal much better for the term of these indenture. The Barbary pirates were still at it since later given that nineteenth century, though these were perhaps not using slaves so much as recording European and American boats teams and holding all of them for ransom. While the European capabilities were busy blowing each other to bits in the Napoleonic conflicts the US delivered it's first international task force into Barbary Coast in 1801 another in 1815 to about stop the Beys of Tunis and Tripoli and the Dey of Algiers focusing on American vessels. So in summary, yes lots. ",

As a matter of fact both sides of my family were enslaved in Europe until the mid 19th century. My father\u2019s grandfather was emancipated in 1848 and my mother's grand father in 1863, though they were still greatly discriminated against back in Europe and in the United States until recently. Then to add insult to injury I suffered discrimination not only from white people in this country due to where my family originated from in eastern Europe, but also from black people due to my white complexion even though one of my father's grandmother's was black. It seems these American black are so racist on the color of a person's skin that it is sickening, This attitude has cost me opportunities in schools and professionally. I guess the one point to thankful for is she was not one of these narrow minded American blacks but a European black. ",

Here is a book that was written about 10 years ago on the subject: White Cargo: The Forgotten History of Britain\u2019s White Slaves in America Don Jordan and Michael WalshBooks - NYU Press There were also enslaved people who were of mixed race and who looked white. Because the condition of slavery was passed through the mother, if their mother was enslaved so were they, no matter how white they looked. Some of them escaped and \u201cpassed\u201d. Many of them did not. One, Ellen Craft, escaped from Macon Georgia with her husband, William, by dressing as a white man going to Philadelphia with his/her male slave for medical treatment. It took them four days, but they finally made it there on a train from Baltimore and were met by some of William Stills\u2019 associates in the Underground Railroad who were always at the train station ready to help black people escape. In this case, they approached William, whispered to him that they would help him escape if he wanted, and he surprised them by not only going with them, but taking Ellen as well, still dressed as a white man. Later, the Crafts wrote a book about their escape, \u201cRunning a Thousand Miles for Freedom.\u201d They went on the Abolitionist lecture circuit and became two of the most famous escapees in the North for a couple of years until they went to England after the Compromise of 1850 made it dangerous for them to remain in the States due to the newly strengthened Fugitive Slave Law.

            "answer_text": "Ottoman slave raids were frequent in the Balkans and Hungary up to the late-18th century to get local females as sex slaves, boys for either workers or to be Janissaries. Tatar slave raids were common up until the 1st annexation of Crimea by Russia. Arab slave trade looked for white slaves as well as other slaves. Though black slaves were held as lesser beings (In Sahih Bukhari, Muhammad is quoted as saying \"Listen and obey your leader, even if he is an Ethiopian with a head like a raisin.\" Islamic scholar Ibn Qutaybah described black people as \"ugly and misshapen because they live in a hot country where the heat overcooks them in the womb and curls their hair.\" Muslim scholar Nasir al-Din Tusi once said: \"The ape is more capable of being trained than the Negro.\") Arab slave raids into Europe can be traced back to 8\u201310th centuries. The barbary corsairs alone being the cause of at least 1 million Europeans being sold into slavery between the 16\u201319th centuries. And let us not talk about laws in Eastern Europe that basically made serfs into slaves in the 17\u201319th centuries. And then we could go back as far as antiquity, the Greeks, the Persians (well to be fair many Iranians are naturally white skinned), the Romans, everybody in antiquity relied on slavery. It was cheap and versatile labour. And apart from that Gulags, Labour camps etc have been known in recent history. ",

It is tempting to blame America for this (why not, we blame them for most things), but much of the rest of the world takes a similar line. But slavery has existing in almost every society for almost all of history. One of the more interesting examples of recent white slavery was the Barbary pirates and their enslaving of Europeans for the North African slave markets. It was nothing on the scale of the Atlantic slave trade (approximately 1.6 million Europeans were sold as slaves, compared to an estimated 12.5 million African slaves), but an interesting inversion of the traditional stereotype. Probably not very PC, but I can\u2019t help feeling it could make a great Hollywood movie.

            "answer_text": "Much attention and condemnation has been directed towards the tragedy of the African slave trade, which took place between the 16th and the 19th centuries. However, another equally despicable trade in humans was taking place around the same time in the Mediterranean. It is estimated that up to 1.25 million Europeans were enslaved by the so-called Barbary corsairs, and their lives were just as pitiful as their African counterparts. They have come to be known as the white slaves of Barbary. In the 13th and 14th centuries, it was Christian pirates, primarily from Catalonia and Sicily, that dominated the seas, posing a constant threat to merchants. It was not until the expansion of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century that the Barbary corsairs started to become a menace to Christian shipping. Around 1600 AD, European pirates brought advanced sailing and shipbuilding techniques to the Barbary Coast, which enabled the corsairs to extend their activities into the Atlantic Ocean, and the impact of Barbary raids peaked in the early to mid-17th century.

The women were particularly popular with the Turks, and one, Aleksandra Lisovska (known in the West as Roxelana, to the Turks as Hurrem Sultan), would have a profound impact on the Ottoman history as she rose up to become the favored wife of Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent at the height of the empire in the 16th century, wielding such influence on the mighty Suleyman that she eventually convinced him to kill his eldest son and heir (born to his first wife). In his place Roxelana\u2019s own son would rule. He became known as Selim the Sot, a drunkard who spent most of his time in the harem, and under whose \u201cleadership\u201d the Ottoman\u2019s gradual but certain decline would begin. The popular Turkish TV drama series \u2018Magnificent Century\u2019 is mostly about the \u201cbattles\u201d of Roxelana within the harem.  ",

They would sometimes kill all the men in the fortresses they took and sell all the women and children into slavery. Same thing with the Romans; they took European slaves, Carthaginian slaves, slaves from what are now France, Belgium, Holland, etc. And then there are the Europeans taken as slaves by the Barbary Pirates of North Africa. The Mongols took plenty of white slaves, including Russians. The Slavs were once slaves or subject to being caught and turned into slaves. Slavery was in nearly every culture for millennia.

For that matter, Spaniards and others brought their white slaves to the Americas as a status symbol. After the Muslim invasion of North Africa, millions of people there, many descended from the Saxons and Huns, were taken as slaves. Then European raids began where over 10 million whites were kidnapped by pirates to sell as slaves. Raiders went as far north as Iceland, taking over 400 slaves there. It was a joke in North Africa, go to the market with an onion, come home with a slave. In Eastern Europe, so many were taken by Magyar and Vikings, we got out modern word for slave, Slav, which means a knight or noble person. Slavery continues today, but most are black Africans or Native Americans, but Asians also suffer it. Libya, where the \u2018springtime\u2019 of dem fame began, is holding open slave auctions. This is strange, because Momar Quadaffi has slave owners hung. ",

Of the 1.5 million black Africans taken as slaves (sold to us by other Africans more often than not). Only 400,000 were sent to the Americas, the rest being sent mostly to the Middle East and receive the worst treatment possible.

They are what helped cause the rise of the Ottoman and they were all to a man slaves. How were they slaves you ask? They were sons from the Christian kingdoms and populations that fell to the Ottomans. They would take the child at a young age, convert them to Islam, train them in the military tradition, and they would fight until their death in the unit. People seem to forget this part of European history, probably because people interpret slave in a way that matches the US concept of it. However, in the broad strokes these men were also they same. They lost their Christian name, their family, their ethnicity, and became Janissary. ",

One of the Caribbean islands and Saudi Arabia didn\u2019t ban it until 1964. It was still practiced in S.A. They take good care of their slaves though, much better than the imported labor from Pakistan. Slavery is still common in parts of India and Pakistan even though it is outlawed. Slavery is still being practiced in the US in big cities. It\u2019s not hard to find. Look for a neon sign that says massage and is open at ten PM. The girls have been brought over from China and they sleep on the massage beds. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm Chinese and I don't know much about white slaves. But I've seen an informal report before. It may be a fake article written to attract readers. The main idea of the article is: 1. The skulls of slave tombs at Yinxu Tombs in Xinjiang, Qinghai and Anyang, Henan, China were studied. It was found that about 3000 years ago, the Caucasians were initially used as slaves by the Chinese Shang Dynasty, and after the death of the king, the Caucasian slaves had to be buried with them. 2. After the excavation of Yin Ruins, Mr. Li Ji, the father of Chinese Archaeology and the main excavator of Anyang Yin Ruins, who unearthed black and white human bones from Yin Ruins, will write a book named Anyang on the basis of archaeological findings. There is a passage in the book: the skulls of Mongolians, blacks and Caucasians were unearthed in Yin Ruins, but the skulls of these people were unearthed in the burial pits, and the owners of the skulls were cruelly executed, which shows that there were black and white people in Henan, and finally only yellow people remained. As for why the black and white people disappeared in the Central Plains later, this is why. It is also a question of great fear. But I don't believe this kind of news. I think it's a way for them to improve Chinese self-confidence. ",

People of ALL colors are getting kidnapped at this present time and being transported to Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Just the term human trafficking, can be found in currant laws throughout the world. Of course there were white slaves, as all races experience slavery. And for those who say it wasn't racial slavery, whites becoming slaves is Africa was racism too. Race only enters in to the equation when a group wanted to justify slavery. Then the followers just went along with it, because they were morally questionable and/ or not very smart. But no one race is just a victim or at fault for slavery. As much as I hate to say it, slavery is a practice of barbarism. And despite the strides in civilization, we are still cursed with barbarism today; a part of the human condition we can't seem to overcome. ",

Slaves figured prominently on the bills of sale in the area of Crimea, the very word \u2018slave\u2019 deriving from \u2018Slav\u2019. By the late Middle Ages, the Slavic lands were, along with the Nordic lands, the last outposts of paganism in Europe and were therefore regarded as the most desirable arena for slave Muslim trade. Slaves were needed for agriculture, for domestic services in the household, and for harems and the royal guards [\u2026] (1) Light skinned slaves are confined in separate areas of the market depending on whether they are Franks, Berbers, Gallegos or Slavs (a term that includes Frankish and Germanic tribes and the people East of them). The blue eyed Germans are thought to make excellent house slaves. Slav women are thought to be attractive enough to fetch a good price. Many of the men, however, end up on small farms where they may spend years or perhaps a lifetime in back-breaking work.[\u2026] Some slaves undoubted have been kidnapped from their homes, but these are a small portion of men and women brought to market.

As recently as 200 years ago, the Turks would send slaving expeditions as far as Ireland and Iceland.

These included the crews of American ships. Thomas Jefferson sent the tiny US Navy off to fight them over it. ",

The majority of white slaves to date are in ex-soviet nations that are Islamic, and in other Islamic countries. Today the majority of the issue of the remnants of slavery are derived from religious scripture indicating it as acceptable provided the slave is not Muslim. Approximately 30,000,000 people are in slavery to date, and that is excluding forced servitude, indentured servitude, and forced prostitution (sex slaves) which make up the vast majority of slavery. According to Amnesty International slavery is a predominantly an Eastern European and African continental problem. Open slave markets are still held in Libya, former Tunis, the location where most slavery in history was conducted through the Barbary pirates. All facts and figures above are sourced from Amnesty International, I would highly recommend reading their website on slavery for more information. ",

During and around that time, Scotland, England, and some Western European countries rounded up and sold their indigenous Gypsy populations as slaves to the colonies, as well. And of course, most of Europe sent criminals to the Americas as slaves.And then there was the Barbary Slave trade between 1500 and 1800 CE, in which North African Muslims raided European villages, sometimes emptying them, and then sold them as slaves throughout the Muslim world.About 1m to 1.25m such slaves were abducted and sold.So, pretty much everybody enslaved anybody in the past, if they could get away with it.

These were the people from the Ukraine, Russia and Belorus, wich were taken in to the Germany during the second world war against their will. These people were taken to work in the factories, or to serve German homeowners and farmers. They hed to wear the \u201cOST\u201d sign, so the people could understand, that they are \u201costs\u201d = not \u201ctruly people\u201c according to the german supemacist ideology. The \u201cost\u201d-person had absolutely no rights, he could be bitten, raped or killed by german, and the german would not be judged. The \u201cost\u201d-person had to obey the orders of his german master or would be panished. Some masters were good and gave more freedom their \u201costarbeiters\u201d, some were wery brutal and could torture and starve their servants, especially in the fabrics. If the \u201costarbeiter\u201d tryed to escape, he could be killed. So, these relationships between \u201costs\u201d and german are pretty similar to the britic americans and black slaves 200 years ago. Do you know, that the word \u201cslave\u201d came from \u201cslavic\u201d people, which were many centuries the object ot the \u201cslave trade\u201d made by the bysantien people, arabs, turks and western europeans? I mean the history of the \u201costarbeiters\u201d was the sort of the legacy of these ancient toxic relationships between western europe and slavic people. ",

There was too much work to do and no one had time to worry about social or \"racial\" divisions. Black and white freely married and cohabited with each other and no one thought anything about it. As the country became more developed and the wealth begin to come in, we all know that this changed dramatically as social divisions were initiated, the consequences and legacy of which plague American society to this day.

Specifically in ancient civilizations slaves and free were the same people, e.g. Greeks enslaved Greeks, Egyptians enslaved Egyptians etc and in North America the native inhabitants enslaved each other. In the modern era and around Europe, Saxons enslaved Saxons, Celts enslaved Celts, and Romans enslaved from all territories they conquered, as did the Greeks. Next, again Europe, the Barbary pirates etc slaved all round the coast of Europe and the Mediterranean up until the early part of the nineteenth century. Slavery still goes on, and is in Europe mainly what you are calling white people e.g sex trafficking and forced working. ",

            "answer_text": "The word \u201cslave\u201d comes from the word \u201cSlavic\u201d which referred to the white slaves that were brought down the trade route running along the Caucasus mountains by the Vikings. The Vikings took their own people down this route to sell as slaves to those in the Middle Eastern / Mesopotamian areas. They worked out very well in the large palaces. House slaves need to be light colored since they stay inside and get no vitamin D. Outdoor slaves need to be dark colored so they don\u2019t die of sunburn in the hot sun. So depending on what type of work you need done (Inside or outside work) this will decide what color of \u201cslav\u201d you should get. The American southerners wouldn\u2019t have imported the Africans if the Native Americans they tried to enslave wouldn\u2019t have been so flimsy and died. Importation of any \u201cresource\u201d is always expensive. So people always will look first to their closest resources. Of course now, most people are just wage slaves, which works out well, since then they are responsible for the housing and food and upkeep. ",

In the ancient European world, Romans made slaves of Greeks, of Germans, of Gauls and Syrians and Egyptians and everybody else. The Greeks in their multiplicity of city states sometimes fought wars with each other and enslaved the survivors. The Krim Tatars, for whom the Crimea is named, for several centuries conducted almost yearly slave raids into Ukraine, Russia and Poland. These Tatars were a distant remnant of the Mongols, but over the couple of centuries they raided, must have enslaved hundreds of thousands if not millions. They had turned Muslim, and were allies of the Ottoman Turks. The North African corsairs out of Tunis, Tripoli and Algiers (the \u201cBarbary Pirates\u201d) often raided the coasts of France and Italy for plunder and slaves. A few American sailors were enslaved in North Africa very early in the 1800s when the corsairs took American ships. Additionally, it\u2019s not so easy to define slavery. In tsarist Russia, there were tens of millions of serfs. If you read about he conditions of serfs, it\u2019s not so easy to say that their condition wasn\u2019t simply slavery in a Russian context.
