            "answer_text": "Was Muhammad an atheist? That is, if you study and reflect on Islam and yet you still remain unconvinced. You understand that it is not possible for Muhammad to have had psychological problems. Therefore, your only reasonable choice being that he lied. He must have been an atheists because he knew there was no god to punish him for doing what he did. Errrr\u2026 what? A guy starts a religion and your only two options are that he was either crazy or was an atheist con-man?Didn\u2019t you even considered that he actually believed in what he said?Consider this option. It is usually the case with the creators of religions and most of religious people (specially with people before the 17th century). Also, what is your basis to claim that \u201cit is not possible for Muhammad to have had psychological problems\u201d? Did you perform a psychological test on him?And, of course, having psychological problems doesn\u2019t exclude the possibilities of being a scammer or a true believer. You can be either and have psychological problems at the same time. In fact, even if he was a con-man, there is not a neccesary condition to be an atheist for that. He could have been a Christian that wanted to scam the Arabs into a false religion. Why should he do that? Because he had psychological problems, of course!So here you are, he can have the three possible options at the same time! Seriously, what kind of question is this?What are you trying to achieve?To start a flame war against Muslims?To start a flame war against Atheists?Or did you have another secret perverse motive? Your question sucks. But thanks for the request anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "From the point of view of every religion, whoever does not believe its deity(ies) is an atheist. The word was first used by the Greeks to refer to the Jews, because they didn\u2019t believe the Hellenic pantheon of gods and because they only believed on one invisible deity. From the Hellenic point of view, Jews were atheists. I am not well versed in Buddhism, much less in the Pali language, but I can bet that the Vedic priests probably lashed a similar accusation against Siddharta, that he was a \u201cgodless\u201d person because he didn\u2019t perform the rituals of the Vedas. \u201cAtheist\u201d meant, strictly, \u201cgodless\u201d. The word would only be refined into the meaning of \u201cone who does not believe any gods at all\u201d after many centuries of philosophy. By the time of Muhammad, nothing of this development had already happened, but the words used were others. Back then, the words used to refer to the concept were \u201cdisbeliever\u201d (or \u201cunbeliever\u201d), \u201cinfidel\u201d or \u201cimpious\u201d. The latter one is particularly common in ancient Christian literature. The others are the most often used in modern translations of the Quran. Muhammad would certainly be termed an atheist by someone of Hellenistic culture. He would certainly be considered a \u201cgodless\u201d person by most polytheist cultures. He was called an \u201cinfidel\u201d by the Christians and, if memory is not failing me, also an \u201cAntichrist\u201d (someone who tries to undo the work of Jesus), an \u201cunbeliever\u201d and an \u201cheretic\u201d. This last term is particularly useful to understand early Christian views of Muhammad. The Christians understood that Muhammad\u2019s message was ripped off Judaism and Christianity. They believed that Muhammad was not ignorant of the Torah and the Gospels\u2014but he rejected both and started his own religion, writing his own book. It\u2019s clear from the content of the Quran that Muhammad did know the Biblical stories and some Christian lore, which he probably got from Christian missionaries and/or Jewish rabbis (assuming he was really illiterate and only dictated the Quran to a scribe, which makes sense, of course). An \u201cheretic\u201d, in the eyes of the Christian Church, is someone who knows the gospels but either adds or perverts the message of Jesus contained therein, preaching something that\u2019s not quite Christianity any more. Christians were quite sensitive about heresy after the Ecumenical Council convened in Nicaea, Asia Minor. The council marked the first major effort to unify Christianity and every divergent interpretation of the Bible, and of the gospels in particular, was deemed \u201cheretic\u201d and sternly condemned. They were so strict that, under the new direction, reputed Christian heroes of the past, like Origen, were lumped with the heretics and given the boot. Those ancient heresies include divergent interpretations of the nature of the Godhead, the personality of Jesus, the role of Mary, the role of John Baptist, the nature of Jesus ministry, the authority of scripture, etc. It escapes the scope of this answer to name and define every heresy, considering that Wikipedia has done it: List of Christian heresies. Under the strict and contemporary Christian view, Muhammad would be classified as an heretic preacher displaying the following heresies (in bold those which most closely identify with Islam): Adoptionism \u2014 the belief that Christ was only chosen by God at the moment of baptism.Arianism \u2014 the belief that Christ had no divine nature. Arianism was so widespread in the first centuries of Christianity that it could have become orthodox. The only reason why it was rejected was that it was mostly followed at the periphery, like the Germanic peoples.Docetism \u2014 the belief that Christ\u2019s suffering at the cross was not real and had no theological purpose, but was just a display to frighten the heathen.Monarchianism \u2014 a pompous name for the belief that the Holy Trinity does not exist, that the Judeo-Christian god is indivisible.Sabellianism \u2014 the teaching that the three persons of the Trinity (as well as angels, demons and the spiritual kitchen sink) are mere \u201cdisguises\u201d of the only one and true God. This heresy negates the entire spiritual world as peopled by intelligent and individual entities.Sethianism \u2014 the belief that Satan is an agent of God. It is not clear whether Muhamma considers Ibliss/Shaitan as an independent being, but some of his quotes suggest Sethianism.Donatism \u2014 among the beliefs of this heresy was that martyrdom is the only way to true salvation.Iconoclasm \u2014 ultimate rejection of all iconography of God, Jesus and even of living creatures. Iconoclasts destroyed religious monuments, idols, icons and all representations of living things (sounds familiar to you?). After this heresy was defeated, the Eastern Church settled for a middle-of-the-road solution to appease the faithful: only bidimensional paintings (\u201cicons\u201d) would be tolerated in churches, and all reliefs and statues would be banned.Montanism \u2014 claim that the era of prophecy had not ended and that God would still send prophets to Earth. Muhammad may have been in contact with Montanist heretics, hence his claim to end all prophecy with himself.So, no. The contemporary Christians would not see Muhammad as an atheist in the sense we attribute to the world today, they\u2019d see him as an heresyarch preaching a new heresy containing elements of the ones mentioned above\u2014perhaps of others I have not remembered\u2014and drawing strongly from Pharisaic teachings of Judaism. Using words like \u201cinfidel\u201d, \u201cgodless\u201d, \u201cgod-forsaken\u201d, \u201cunbeliever\u201d and others (even \u201catheist\u201d, in a Greek-speaking context) would not imply an accusation of atheism as we understand the term nowadays. These words, when employed in antiquity, were mostly name-calling, to humiliate those receiving them. \u201cInfidel\u201d means \u201cunfaithful\u201d, but also \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d. \u201cGodless\u201d and \u201cgod-forsaken\u201d do not imply the attitude of the person towards God, but the supposed attitude of God towards the person. A \u201cgodless\u201d person is someone God is not counting among His own. \u201cUnbeliever\u201d or \u201cdisbeliever\u201d is someone who rejected the true teaching he has received, in favour of other teachings (or none at all). But did Muhammad believe in a personal God? Probably yes and by default. The fact that his God is so different from the Christian deity is a reflex of his different cultural background. He understands God in his own way, while the Christians, hailing from richer and more cultured cities, had a more sophisticated (but not inherently superior) definition of the godhead. Sophisticated in the sense of \u201ccomplicated\u201d, not in the sense of \u201cperfected\u201d. ",
