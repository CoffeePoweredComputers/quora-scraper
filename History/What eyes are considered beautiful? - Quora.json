            "answer_text": "Having what\u2019s considered beautiful eyes have a lot to do with 2 things: Eye shapeBrow positionBelow are the most common Eye Shapes  All eye shapes are beautiful. Nevertheless, a lot of people feel that being able to see a visible eyelid crease is more attractive than not being able to see any eyelid crease, especially with women. This is why some people who have monolid and hooded eyes have surgery to take off excess skin from their upper eyelids in order to show a more visible upper eyelid crease. Brow position also plays a big role. Below are women with lower brow positions on the left. Women with higher brows are on the right.  Having lower brows, and hooded eyes appear will make for a more mysterious, and deep set look. Men usually have a lower brow position than women. As a male, having more hooding to the upper eye area and a lower brow position (which men usually have) is seen as a more masculine look. Women usually have a higher eyebrow position with more arch present than men. With regards to eye shape, this is seen as more feminine. Another thing that plays an effect on eyes and attraction is the brow bone area known as the glabella. Men usually have a more prominent brow ridge compared to women. When males undergo facial feminization surgery, the brow bone area is sometimes shaved down to make it look more feminine.

On males - vertically narrow, \u201chunter\u201d eyes, with thick(ish) limbal rings (those small dark circles around the colored part of your eye), lack of upper-eyelid showing, positive or neutral canthal tilt (your eyes are not pointed downwards), hooded and \u201cdep set eyes\u201d On females - pretty much the same, except females are okay with \u201calmond eyes\u201d, while on males, they are unattractive Toni Mahfud: Notice that his eyes are a lot more horizontal than vertical as well as their symmetry, lack of upper-eyelid exposure and hooded-ness  Notice upper-eyelids showing, negative canthal tilt (eyes pointing downwards) as well as more verticality  DISCLAIMER: I am aware that this is EXTREMELY shallow, but I am trying to be objective and scientific, saying \u201call eyes are beautiful\u201d, or \u201ceyes that show depth and where you can \u201csee their soul\u201d \u201c, is not going to help anyone ",
