            "answer_text": "Baroque music is a musical style that followed the Renaissance music period and ran from approximately the years 1600 to 1750. Prior to the Baroque period music was disorganized following no categorization.  The Baroque period can be broken down into separate phases but today we will generalize. The word \"baroque\u2019 is derived from the Portuguese word \u201cbarroco\u201d and loosely means \u201cmalformed pearl\u201d An apt description of the state of music at the start of this transition into a sense of structure. Much of the music of this period was written with the humble harpsichord in mind. In time the lautenwerck or lute/harpsichord became a very influential component of the music along with the baroque German violin bow, both instruments becoming an integral part of the music of the era. The German bow was highly arched, loosely strung compared to other bows common in the time and it was played differently allowing a skilled violinist far greater range of musical notes. J.S. Bach whom hopefully needs no introduction to most was an avid fan of the bow. Bach, composer and musician is well known for his astounding contributions to the music of the Baroque period. He is credited with bringing together the primary styles, forms, and national traditions into an sense of cohesion. But the life then was far different in numerous ways that preceded our present day world. The church factored heavily in life then. Musicians of note then were pressured by the church to create cantata\u2019s ( a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment) influencing the music of the period. Many factors influenced the music of the period, but the above are the most predominate factors that shaped the music of the baroque period. A turbulent time in history in a many ways that left us with some truly astounding music. Johann Sebastian Bach, 1685 \u2013 28 July 1750  ",

            "answer_text": "The German polyphonic tradition was native, and among its practitioners were the Bach family, culminating in J. S. Bach. He was the greatest polyphonic composer of all and is considered to be the summation and pinnacle of German polyphony. The Italian style became an important influence: less polyphonic, more melodic, livelier, using concerto form extensively, with probably more popular appeal. J. S. Bach was well aware of Vivaldi\u2019s compositions and transcribed some of them for his own use. Some of his keyboard pieces and concertos use dance forms from Italy and France, with Italian liveliness in some melodic themes, combined with Bach\u2019s incomparable polyphonic mastery. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not going to give a detailed answer because it would involve a break down into individual German composers. Broadly speaking, German baroque composers took their cue from Italian baroque music, so that is influence No.1. A second influence would be the \u201cKapellmeister\u201d culture of the day, whereby composers were expected to produce music of a specific type according to the specifications of the dignitary who provided their pay packet.
