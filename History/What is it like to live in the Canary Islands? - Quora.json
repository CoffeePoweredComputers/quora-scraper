            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve only been living here since October, so not exactly a veteran, but I can give you some first impressions. The weather: Is great, at least here in South Tenerife. It\u2019s January 1st, I spent the day on the beach with the kids. Last night we sat on the beach at midnight in Los Cristianos to watch the fireworks, and had to wear jumpers because it was a bit chilly. I live up in the mountains a bit where it's \u201ccold\u201d and the temperatures at night have dropped as low as 11 degrees Centigrade a few times in the last month. The food: Is good. Plenty of fresh veg, fruit and fish available at very reasonable prices. Plenty of good and not expensive restaurants. Cost of living: Food\u2019s pretty much the same price as France, where I moved from. Petrol is waaaaay cheaper, I can fill the tank of my car for under \u20ac40. Cigarettes are very cheap, alcohol also. Nicotine patches and gum on the other hand are about 50% more expensive. Pharmacy prices comparable to France. Rents about the same depending on where you live, a two bed apartment can set you back anything from 400\u20ac to 1000\u20ac a month, probably more for a really nice flat in a popular area. Utilities are pricey, but as you don't really have much of a heating bill, it evens out. Unemployment is high, wages are low. But there is work for those who are willing to put in the extra effort. School: My kids are at the local public school and I am really happy with it for the moment. Their classes are interesting, there's a lot of effort put in to make school fun, which helps the kids learn. In terms of curriculum, the maths level is slightly more demanding than it was in France, the rest is hard to compare as the girls are still getting to grips with the Spanish. My elder daughter is autistic, she's been excellently received, is getting far more help in school than in France and is integrated in a regular class with her own age group. The other kids are wonderful and have really welcomed her, she's made friends, something she hadn't done in France really. The teachers and headmaster are always ready to listen to us and discuss any issues we might have. The locals, Canarian and expats, have been warm and friendly. My landlady, an old lady in her eighties, who lives in the flat downstairs, frequently leaves us little gifts of cakes she has baked, potatoes from her garden etc. I already feel more part of the community here than I did after five years of living in the same town in France. It\u2019s kid friendly, it's animal friendly (mostly, although finding a rental that accepts animals is a bit of a headache). School hours are 8:30 till 1:30pm, which leaves plenty of time for the kids to do other stuff. In our free time we go for walks, there's plenty of little and big hikes nearby, up and around the mountains. We go to the tourist attractions, residents get preferential rates for many places (Siam Park, for example, do a year ticket for \u20ac60 for adults, as many times as you want to go), travel to the continent or the other islands is also discount for us. We go out and listen to bands, or just go to a bar and play pool (when the grandparents are available to babysit). And of course we go to the beach, to swim, snorkel, sunbathe. And we feel safe. There's crime, of course, but less than elsewhere. And a strong, but friendly police presence. Stuff that\u2019s not so good: Driving. Traffic jams are frequent on the TF1. There are many bad drivers, or drivers who are doing their best but are driving cars they're not used to, on the wrong side of the road. Parking, there's not enough space for everyone. Oh and there are some pretty scary roads. I\u2019m not a very confident driver and occasionally I find myself on some roller coaster nightmare road that my SatNav has put me on, unable to turn back because it's too narrow, or there's someone behind me, and I just have to drive carefully and hope for the best, so far so good (touch wood). Paperwork, a bit of a hassle, but once it's done it's done. Cockroaches, bleah, they make my skin crawl, and they are inevitable. My mother in law keeps her house super clean but she still gets them, we have less despite my feeble housekeeping talents, it's probably too cold for them up here. And \u2026 No actually can't think of anything else. Hope that answers some of your question. Edited to add a few of my photos now that this answer is almost two years old. Enjoy\u2026 A crowded Fuerteventura beach  Some goats waiting for a bus in Fuerteventura  My local Romeria (Rural Fiesta), they bring the animals through the main streets of the town. The donkey is a firm favourite with the kids.  Lava formations near the top of El Teide, Tenerife.  A sunset over the bay in Alcala, South Tenerife. The shadow beyond the water is the island La Gomera.  The village school carnival (guess the theme that year anyone?)   The night sky in Tenerife.  Dolphin and whale watching boat trips are almost never disappointing. Do you see the babies swimming next to their mums?  Another pic from the Romeria, the carts are full of locals, in full traditional Canarian dress, who hand out bananas, hard boiled eggs, glasses of wine, potatoes to all the bystanders. No need to cook on Romeria day, just stand in the street and people feed you.  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! I've lived in Tenerife since I was 5 until my mid twenties. I still think of it as my hometown and I keep visiting my closest friends and family 3 or 4 times a year. The best of it: - The safety: I'm not saying there's no crime at all, but the mayority of us never had the feeling of being in a dangerous environment, as I've later experienced in some other bigger places around the world. It was normal for all the kids to go play in the street by ourselves since we were 9 or 10 years old.  - The amazing weather: The Canary Islands have one of the best climates in the world all year round. Being Tenerife the most montanious of them all, there are bigger differences of temperature and precipitations between some cities, specially between north and south, but still, scenes like the one below are quite common in winter.  Las Teresitas Beach, Santa Cruz de Tenerife (taken 1st of January 2016) - The cheap life: Seriously, for what I'm paying in London for a flatshare I could get a 3 bedroom villa by the beach in Tenerife. We also enjoy some tax exemptions because of our condition of ultra peripheral region. - The nature: If you like outdoors, this is your place. The people in the islands have a strong relationship with nature in general and the sea in particular. Sports play a very important role in everyone's life. Between the beaches, the innumerable trails, the mountains and the good weather to enjoy them all, there's always something to do.   Pico Teide (Tenerife's dormant volcano, and highest peak in Spain) Now the not so good things:  - Transport can get tricky: Public transport is not as reliable or frequent as it should, so most of us drive a car there. - Not so much going on: Specially when I was younger, I was always forced to go to the mainland if I wanted to see my favourite artist live, or any special trendy show. There are a few music festivals, and some big artists and acts have happened in the past, but obviously, not as often as if you are in a big city. - Education, jobs, challenges: The islands took a hard hit when the recession started, and there's still a high amount of unemployment. I studied my degree there and started working straight after I finished, so I was lucky, but if I had to do it all over again I would've gone out sooner to a more challenging environment.  If you have a regular job here it's really easy to get too comfortable. And that can sometimes be a bad thing. As soon as I moved to London I found out life's not as easy as I thought. I'm now surrounded by brilliant, hard working, clever and focussed people who push me to work harder and become a better version of myself. That's what I missed there. Life in the Canaries was most certainly better, but I've found more excitement somewhere else.  In short: Living in the Canaries has been a blessing for most my life, but the islands are far from being perfect and they certainly don't suit everybody. If you have the chance to live there for a bit, it's totally worth it anyway. ",
