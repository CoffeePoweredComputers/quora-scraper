            "answer_text": "The French author and former soldier, Jean Larterguy is quite clear about this issue in his novel \u201cLes Centurios.\u201d The French did not understand the Vietminh\u2019s unconventional tactics, they tried to overcome an underground, peoples militia with conventional means. The Vietminh military machine was truly like a \u201cfish in the water\u201d, to quote Mao ZeDong. They should have launched their own battle for the population\u2019s hearts and minds, to mobilize the Vietnamese for France in stead of the Vietminh, or \u201cViets\u201d as the French referred to them. And that is where it becomes tricky - they had to convince colonized peasants to turn against the Vietminh movement that aimed to break the hold of France on Indo-China. A war is won by many means, one of these is is information/intelligence, and in this respect the French always played 2nd fiddle to the Viets. They found it hard to control especially the rural areas, where their enemies at night were the farmers, riksha drivers or cleaners in day time. Each individual Bo-Doi fighter was supported by about a half a dozen faceless non-combatants who lived their daily lives among the French residents and military. Ha Van Lau, Vietnam\u2019s ambassador to the UN, was a junior Vietminh officer during the battle of Dien Bien Phu, and he also mentioned this to Michael Maclear, author of Vietnam, The Ten Thousand Day War. The French responded to this with \u201cestablishing\u201d presences, walking patrols, road-side checkpoints etc which had the equivalent effect of a sieve on trapping water. In order to have made an impact, they had to be \u201cin there\u201d with the main population, and that was well nigh impossible, very few of the military spoke Annamese, let alone understood the culture. The culture shock for new arrivals in the military was profound. Many units were not well led and all levels of the military leadership had very little knowledge of Annamese culture, customs or language. Discipline was a problem as well to some extent and much of the heavy lifting fell to airborne units such as 1e Regiment Etranger de Parachutists. They had the vestige of a chance at Dien Bien Phu, but they allowed themselves to be trapped in the Dien Bien Phu valley. I think de Castries (the commander at Dien Bien Phu) thought of establishing strong point on some of the hills around the valley, but de Navarre (the commander in Chief in Hanoi) discouraged the idea. (Note: I speak to correction here.) The irony is that when the Vietminh finally defeated the French in the Indo-China colonial war, they did so by conventional means. Neither de Castries nor de Navarre believed that the Viets has significant artillery, or that it could be employed at Dien Bien Phu. They were very wrong on both accounts. The Vietminh had howitzers, and the almost impossible task of the Vietminh dragging the artillery pieces up the mountain slopes is nowadays almost part of military legend. The artillery pieces enabled the Vietminh to dictate the battle, and after the first salvo the French could but cower in their trenches and engage in hand-to-hand combat with Vietminh infantry when they stormed the French strong -points. Lastly, to have been remotely successful in Indo-China, the French also needed the unequivocal support of the French population back-home, another obstacle as the Indo-Chinese war was unpopular with many French, The French Communist newspaper L\u2019Hummanite campaigned constantly against the war and its anti-war editorials often bordered on libel and treason. Indo-China simply was not seen as having the same valuae or prestige as say, Algeria, which was regarded as part of the French metropole, which Indo-China was not. When Algeria was lost it shook France to the core, when Indo-China was lost, shoulders were merely shrugged. ",

            "answer_text": "Sounds crazy but the best chance of winning for the French would have been to promise Vietnamese Independence once the war was over\u2026 basically do what the British did in Malaya against the Commies. But not just that! Also land reform, to win over the peasants. Also far far far less warcrimes and brutality and bombing city. I\u2019m surprised how many people have no idea about how bloody, cruel and ruthless the French were in Vietnam. Obviously a more gently, hearts and minds touch would have worked much better than harsh repression. The last point is key: Controlling the Vietnamese-Sino border to prevent Mao from giving weapons, supplies, and refuge from the French. This would have been hard, but necessary. These conditions were needed but I doubt they could have been possible. France at that point was fighting to preserve what was left of her empire after WW2 to avenge pride and they were not going to abandon Vietnam as a colony. Perhaps she could have been less bloodthirsty and more hearts and minds we will never know. AS for securing the border I doubt France had the manpower, weapons and resources to do so. ",
