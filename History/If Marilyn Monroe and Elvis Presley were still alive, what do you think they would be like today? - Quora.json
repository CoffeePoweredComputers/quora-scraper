            "answer_text": "For one thing, Marilyn Monroe was born June 1, 1926, which means that she would be 92. Elvis was born January 8, 1935, which means that he would be 83 today. Both would be long gone from stages and/or screens. Marilyn died in 1962 at the age of 36. Elvis died in 1977 when he was 42. We all have our moments in the sun when we are young and beautiful (or even middle-aged and beautiful) but nobody is going to be paying attention to a 92-year-old female. Another extremely beautiful sex symbol of the sixties was Brigitte Bardot, and you hear nothing about her today. Marilyn\u2019s life might be something like Doris Day\u2019s. Doris (and Brigitte, also, I think) have dedicated themselves to protecting animals. An elderly woman is the most invisible citizen on the planet. An old man is also nearly a non-person, but not nearly as invisible as a woman in her nineties. ",

I think they\u2019re pretty accurate. But nobody knows for sure what they would look like. So many things can influence the appearance of a person; personal health choices, accidents (or lack of accidents), sicknesses (or lack of sickness), even emotional states. We can only guess. ",
