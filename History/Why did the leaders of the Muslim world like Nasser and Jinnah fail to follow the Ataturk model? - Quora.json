            "answer_text": "Because Ataturk\u2019s model was seen as a betrayal, it\u2019s something people tend not to understand What Ataturk did was well known in the Arab World, it\u2019s part of a famous debate outside the West: Modernization v. Westernization There\u2019s Modernization, in others words replacing pre-industrial (also called Traditional) systems with modern systems. To use Morocco as an example: Pre-Modern: Tribal Chief has an army of Tribesmen, Sultan names him Pasha/Caid of a specific region. Title is tailored to how powerful the Chief is. Regions fluctuate as more powerful Chiefs want to govern more land.Post Modernization: 12 regions with clear borders governed by Governors who are chosen by the King to rule for a few years.The Traditional system was replaced with a Modern system. But then there\u2019s Westernization. Which is best described as opening a Wikipedia article on a Western nation and just copying and pasting everything onto your plan titled \u201cWhat our country should start doing!\u201d Ataturk westernized Turkey, Nasser modernized Egypt Now to be fair, as one Harvard article on Ataturk notes: (Ataturk) defined modernization as reaching a level of contemporary civilization and Westernization. https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42004235/AKGUL-DOCUMENT-2019.pdf?sequence=1 In other words, Ataturk believed that Modernization and Westernization were the same exact thing. However for many Arab thinkers, this made Ataturk a traitor. The best way to explain how: Measurements Under the Ottoman Empire, the Turks developed their own independent system of measurements. Such as dunam for area (square kilometers), ayak for feet etc. Modernization would have seen the Ottoman measure system continue to be used. Because it was part of Turkish culture and history, it\u2019s a measurement system that is inherently Turkish and was so influential that countries like Israel still use parts of it today! US accuses Israel of expropriating 2,342 dunams in the Jordan Valley Ignore the headline, an Israeli newspaper discussing Israeli politics is using the Ottoman measurement for land area. If Ataturk had wanted to, he could have patronized the Ottoman system and watched it flourish in the region. Which is why: Ataturk banned it in favor of the West\u2019s metric system! In 1931, Ataturk banned all use of the Ottoman measurements in favor of Western ones. I use this as an example as: The Ottoman measurement system had nothing to do with Islam, so this isn\u2019t some part of a \u201csecular State\u201dThe Ottoman measurement system had nothing to do with Arabs, so it wasn\u2019t an attempt to cut off Turks from Arabs.For many Arabs, destroying a Turkish system in favor of a Western system just made no sense. The Ottoman measurements were in no way an obstacle to modernization. That is why he was seen as a traitor by many Arab ideologues The notion that one would be ashamed of their ancestors and their culture so as to eliminate it even when it posed no obstacle to modernization was seen as strange. This is while Ataturk for example banned traditional Turkish headgear in favor of Western headgear. The Baathist Party in Iraq did the exact opposite.  The Baathist Party was pro-modernization but anti-Westernization so rather than emulate Ataturk\u2019s model and ban Arab clothing and demand Arabs dress like Westerners, the Party instead glorified and exalted traditional Arab attire and the Bedouins.  Saddam Hussein wearing Arab-style headgear out in public among Iraqis To be fair, in the end, most Muslim countries used a mixture of Modernization and Westernization Morocco\u2019s education system is a \u201ccopy and paste\u201d of France\u2019s education system. However on the flip side, our King has never banned Moroccan traditional attire like Ataturk did.  King Mohammed VI dressed in what Moroccans historically considered formal attire: a Djellaba, Fez and Babouche (although his have heels) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the first thing \u201cAraturk Model\u201d reminds us of, are his anti-Islamic methods, famously known as Kemalist Ideology. \u201cMustafa Kemal Araturk\u201d is known more for prohibiting the (Arabic) Azaan in Turkey. Araturk mocked Islam to such an extent, that he even labeled Islam as \u201ca conspiracy to drag Arab National Politics over all Nations\u201d (as mentioned in his own work titled Vatanda\u015f i\u00e7in Medeni Bilgiler). Interestingly, Kemak Ataturk started denouncing Islam only after he came to power, even though he showcased himself as the \u201cChampion of Turkish Muslims\u201d before he came to power (in Turkey). Had Nasser or Jinnah emulated Atat\u00fcrk model in Egypt or Pakistan, both these countries would have fallen into civil strife. I seriously doubt the Questioner's intentions behind asking this dubious question. Kemal Atat\u00fcrk tried his best to replace the \u201clove of Islam\u201d among Turkish Muslims, with the \u201clove of Turkey\", i.e. \u201cReplace Religion with Patriotism\u201d - a deceptive ideology that is being promoted globally since the last century or so. He even replaced the Arabic script which was used to write the Turkish language, with the Latin script and closed all religious schools. I have attached some information below from the archives files- His interview with the US Ambassador Charles H. Sherill, who wrote the biography of Atat\u00fcrk, was published in the Social History magazine with the signature of R\u0131fat N. Bali- Sherill explains: Atat\u00fcrk boasts that the Turkish people should be disgusted with Islam, if Turks understand the Quran (in the way Atat\u00fcrk thinks about Quran). Sherill says: Atat\u00fcrk assumes that the Turkish people are not really religious, only attracted to loud prayers (even though Sherill himself admits that \u201che was not affected by any of the Christian communities he saw as much as the Muslim worship he watched in Hagia Sophia on the evening of January 23, 1933, and that he was convinced of the sincerity of the worship he witnessed in Turkey. There was neither music nor an eloquent orator to attract this crowd). Sherill further states: The only religious education Kemal Atat\u00fcrk received was a \u201cQuran lesson\" (reading lesson) for one month, at the age of 6. Sherill also mentions that, Atat\u00fcrk prides the ruthless persecution of imams and muezzins - which Atat\u00fcrk ordered after the \u201cBursa Incident\u201d - wherein Imams and Muezzins resisted against Atat\u00fcrk's attempt to divide Muslims, or Turkey-fy Islam (when Atat\u00fcrk dictated that all Turkish Muslims can only recite the Islamic \u201ccall to prayer\u201d and \u201cIslamic Prayer\u201d in Turkish language only, instead of Arabic).
