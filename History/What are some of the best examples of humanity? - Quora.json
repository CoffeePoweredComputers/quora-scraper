            "answer_text": "A family was having dinner in a posh restaurant. The kid felt full. Husband and wife were also full. He turned towards his mom \u201cI am unable to eat it. I am full mamma\u201d \u201cOkay, leave. Let's go to movie. Come\u201d she said getting up. Husband paid the bill and gave hefty tip. And as they stepped outside they saw dirty pair of hands infront of them. A beggar stood and asked for something which they can offer to him. \u201cGet away\u201d said husband and avoided beggar's contact with him. Wife as well moved with him. But kid didn't move. \u201cPappa, I want to take parcel of what we left\u201d he said. \u201cWould you eat?\u201d Father asked turning back. \u201cYes, pappa\u201d replied kid. He knew his father wouldn't agree if he had told he would give that parcel to the beggar. Kid ran inside the restaurant. But before he reached their table, the table was cleaned. He felt bad. Idea! Wow! He went to counter and offered 50 Rupees his father had given to him as pocket money. \u201cWhat you want kid?\u201d The counter lady said amused. Lady knew nothing was available at that price in their restaurant. \u201cAnything. He is hungry.\u201d Kid said pointing at the beggar who stood outside. Lady smiled at the kid. She placed the order for biryani. \u201cCan you give it to him please? My parents would be angry if I am late.\u201d Kid said and he ran out as soon as the lady nodded. Within 10 minutes, biryani was ready and the lady herself went out and offered it to the beggar. The smile on his face was sublime. He blessed her. She asked him to bless that kid rather her. She was happy. She did good deed today. She had paid rest of the Biryani's from her pocket. The smile came from the beggar's face was far more valuable than what she paid for. And the humanity she showed was no where near to that of kid's she felt. She was happy to bring smile on someone's face today. She could contribute something if not whole. Are we able to make someone smile everyday? Think over it. Avi ",

            "answer_text": "Humanity never ends : Heart Touching story  One day, a poor boy who was selling goods from door to door to pay his way through school, found he had only one thin dime left, and he was hungry. He decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry so brought him a large glass of milk He drank it slowly, and then asked, \u201cHow much do I owe you?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything,\u201d she replied \u201cMother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness.\u201d He said\u2026 \u201cThen I thank you from my heart.\u201d As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt; stronger physically, but his faith in God and man was strong also. He had been ready to give up and quit. Years later that young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed in his doctor\u2019s gown he went in to see her. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room determined to do his best to save her life. From that day he gave special attention to the case. After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room. She feared to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked, and something caught her attention on the side as she read these words\u2026\u2026 \u201d Paid in full with one glass of milk.\u201d (Signed) Dr. Howard Kelly. Tears of joy flooded her eyes as her happy heart prayed: \u201cThank You, GOD, that Your love has spread abroad through human hearts and hands.\u201d Beautifully Different Talli Osborne is different. Her multicolored mohawk and multiple piercings make her look more like a band member than a motivational speaker. She rides a hot-pink scooter with skulls on it. To other \u201cpunx\u201d in the punk rock community, she\u2019s known as \u201cNubs,\u201d based on the song \u201cShe\u2019s Nubs,\u201d written about Osborne. She believes that differences should be embraced.  Embracing the different is nothing new for Osborne. She was born without arms and the majority of bones in her legs, which is why she requires the scooter. But rather than letting this difference be a limitation, she embraces it, and in her words, \u201clets her difference sparkle.\u201d Before becoming one of the most sought-after inspirational speakers on the TEDx roster, she rose through the ranks at Virgin Mobile Canada to become the airline\u2019s best customer service agent in the Americas. Richard Branson even includes her in his list of top 10 most inspirational people in the world. With a natural gift for storytelling, her presentations weave humor, wit and grace into powerful messages about acceptance and tolerance: \u201cI want people to leave my presentations feeling inspired and motivated, to be the best person they can be, to learn to love themselves, dream big and live life to the fullest.\u201d \u2014Mary Carlomagno MORAL if you help anyone , the time comes when that person whom you had helped in past. Helping others in need is true sign of humanity\u2026\u2026!! ",
