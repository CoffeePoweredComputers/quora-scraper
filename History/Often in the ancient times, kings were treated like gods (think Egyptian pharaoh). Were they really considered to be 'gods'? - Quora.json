            "answer_text": "I don't think that there are any writings by a King of the Sumerians or Roman Emperor that say explicitly \"this living god thing is a total scam...suckers\". In fact there are very few non-official writings by any ancient king so it is very difficult to know what their actual thoughts were. That being said, it is not out of the question that they would actually believed that they were the embodiment  of gods. Remember that ancient polytheistic gods were much less powerful and alien than the Judeo/Christian/Islamic omnipotent omniscient  uber-god. Take the Greco-Roman pantheon, the gods were petty, they fought amongst each other, they made mistakes and felt remorse, they were tricked and felt angry about it, and above all, they were very, very jealous of each other and of mortals. Basically they were like regular people who could also control the weather or turn people into a stag and so on. It is not that far fetched that a King who controlled the well being of his kingdom, controlled the grain reserves and the army and the irrigation system would feel a little godlike. ",

            "answer_text": "We must understand that the dawn of civilization was not like the 1950es only without cars. There were fundamental psychological differences that are hard to imagine without thorough studies. Life was brutish and short. Writing, mathematics and astronomy were still indistinguishable from magic for the ordinary person. There was no recorded body of scientific knowledge, much less available to the common worker. As a result, their view of the world was extremely chaotic compared to ours. Most people did not have a coherent self. Certainly they had a sense of self in the form of identifying with their body, like higher animals do, but beyond that they identified with their family / clan / tribe. Even names were not always strictly personal but a son or nephew could inherit the name when someone died, giving rise to stories of people living for hundreds of years. In this chaotic world, there were some people who had developed a stronger ego. Even today some people are more charismatic and strong-willed, and weaker wills find it hard to gainsay them even when there is no overt threat. In a time when common people barely knew who they were, a strong leader was literally seen as something divine, incomprehensible by common men. ",
