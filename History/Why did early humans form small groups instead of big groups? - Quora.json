            "answer_text": "Gloria Cole, has given you the correct answer, but I would just add.. It seems that thirty folk give or take a few people, is the best size for a group of any size, especially hunter gatherers. The reason being, that it gives the group maximum cohesion, you can get to know very well everyone in the group, they will pretty well all be kinsmen, and life will be fairly egalitarian. Also it gives a good balance to the mix of the group. There will be enough youngsters to provide a future, there will be a few elderly, to care for those youngsters, and to pass on the group\u2019s wisdom. And there will be enough folk to take on specialist tasks and hunt and gather to optimum effect, and so feed the entire group including those who are too young or old, to care for them selves.. A much bigger group, is not necessary, however if it occurs and does not split, there may well develop factions within the group causing discord and lead to a hierarchy. This was solved when we did form larger groups such as villages and small city states, by having an agreed hierarchy, usually backed up by enforced rules, often attributed to a higher spirit than a mere mortal, and enforced by a chief and a priest who interpreted the spirits /Gods wishes for the behaviour of the group, enabling a harmonious existence.. the Ten Commandments are one such example of a good recipe for harmonious communal living. They came into being, as a group of nomadic Israelites were moving towards settled living in a city state Jericho. And their importance has, often through conquest over thousands of years, pretty much dictated behaviour over a vast swathe of humanity. Hope that helps. ",
