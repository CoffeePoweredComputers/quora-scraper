            "answer_text": "Putin is doing it because he, as an ex-KGB agent, hates the US with every fibre of his being. As in the last election he\u2019s probably working to get Trump into the WH again. Iran is doing the same and I expect China may be as well. But WHY try and get Trump back in? They are doing it because Trump has destroyed the alliances it had with other nations, he has messed up so many times that America is in turmoil, its debts are going through the roof.  Americans don\u2019t trust their government which is 11th on the list and dropping by 14% China is No. 1 and rising by 8%.  Russia, Iran, and China are working as hard as they can to make sure Trump ends up in the WH for another 4 years. The reason - America will cease to be a real danger to the rest of the world if those three nations succeed in taming the excesses of America that threaten everyone on the planet including Americans.

More fun than debating who\u2019s the most corrupt between republicans and democrats. Freedom bombing some hapless country and saving the world from evil child eating commie zombie hordes is always good to reunite a divided country. ",
