            "answer_text": "They came to but were slow to adopt this game changer. In the years prior to World War II, Japan had knowledgeable researchers in the technologies necessary for radar; they were especially advanced in magnetron development. However, a lack of appreciation of radar's potential and rivalry between army, navy and civilian research groups meant Japan's development was slow. It was not until November 1941, just days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, that Japan placed into service its first full radar system. In August 1942, U.S. marines captured one of these first systems, and, although crude even by the standards of early U.S. radars, the fact the Japanese had any radar capability came as a surprise. Japanese radar technology was 3 to 5 years behind that of America, Great Britain, and Germany throughout the war. Radar in World War II - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "The usual inter service rivalry meant that Japan ended up with 3 sets of research Army, Navy and Civilian. A Japanese scientist who developed the aerial technology used in British and German radar systems wasn't even included in any of the military research programs, when a British set was captured they were with it documentation they didn't realize the component referred to a Japanese invention. British and American captured set were reverse engineered but Japan even with data shared by German were 2 to 3 years behind. It should be remembered that US development was leapfroged be data shared by Britain whilst British deployment was accelerated by US production methods and industrial capacity. The Japanese correctly deduced that RADAR would be detected before it could detect you because the signal has to bounce off and get back to the sender. However after producing RADAR warning set the Allies had started rolling out new sets on smaller wave lengths which the system could not detect so they would only pick up ships with older set sets until a new system was produced.
