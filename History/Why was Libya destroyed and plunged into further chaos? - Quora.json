            "answer_text": "The short answer: Libya went through 42 years of dictatorship by one eccentric man, followed by rebellion and civil war, followed by the armament of unaccountable, rival militias, terrorist groups, and criminal gangs who overwhelmed the political scene, and the rise of an ambitious warlord who seeks to control all of Libya and eliminate militias. The long answer: To begin, Libya went through a civil war precipitated by a mass protest against the government of Muammar Gaddafi and the brutal response by Gaddafi\u2019s forces, starting in February 2011. This revolution followed similar mass protests in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt that took down long-time dictators. The difference is that Gaddafi would not step aside and the situation escalated very quickly into an armed conflict between militias and soldiers, either backing Gaddafi or opposing him. This link here shows a wide variety of videos from this era, containing videos of protests/ protesters, demonstrations against Gaddafi, battles, injuries/killings, counter-protests/ shows of support for Gaddafi, testimony, and other findings. (WARNING: It goes without saying that as many of these involve bloodshed, so they may be very graphic) SaveLibya Now Western nations, for motives retrospectively subject to contentious debate, took the side of the rebels. After a month during which there were already a great many casualties and threats by Gaddafi against his opponents, the NATO nations began to bombard Gaddafi\u2019s forces from the air and providing aid to the rebels. NATO forces played a decisive role in the conflict, though it must be noted that Libyans themselves fought and died in the battle. Now what happened next is a consequence of many events that took place either as a result of Gaddafi\u2019s dictatorship, or the civil war itself: There were no lasting institutions that remained behind as a result of Gaddafi\u2019s rule. Most notably, the national army was significantly weakened by Gaddafi, because of coup attempts in the \u201970s (Gaddafi himself came to power in the military coup). Therefore, following the downfall of the regime, a formal, conventional army was not there to secure the peace.Militias take over the scene: there were tens of thousands of militiamen in disparate brigades fighting for and against Gaddafi during the revolution. They had little incentive to demobilize. Worse: with the decision to give salaries to revolutionary fighters, the militias were able to use the money to recruit more individuals and acquire more weapons (notably from Gaddafi\u2019s vast stores). Elected officials were helpless and sometimes held hostage as militias stamped their authority on a weak central government.It doesn\u2019t help matters that many criminals were released from prisons (unknown whether if by Gaddafi or those opposed to him) and given weapons to fight in the conflict/ post-conflict.Many from both sides of the conflict as those loyal to Gaddafi and those opposed sought vengeance and there were reprisal killingsExploitation of the weak central authority. Africans seeking passage to Europe had been making their way through Libya even before Gaddafi\u2019s fall (and Gaddafi would use blocking of African migrants to extract certain favors from the Europeans). Unchecked by central authority, smuggling gangs exploited African migrants in ways that make the headlines today. Added to this is the rise of ultraconservative Islamist militias, most notably Ansar Al-Sharia and later ISIS as well. ISIS took over Sirte (Gaddafi\u2019s hometown, the last battle of the first Libyan civil war), until being dislodged in 2016. Benghazi, the epicenter of the Libyan revolution, fell under the control of a number of Islamic fundamentalist groups that have done battle with another force in Libya\u2019s tangled web:The rise of Khalifa Haftar: Haftar, once a Gaddafi loyalist, turned rogue against Gaddafi with CIA backing, lived in Virginia for the better part of 20\u201325 years, returned to Libya at the start of the Libyan conflict in 2011, become a ground commander and lieutenant general for the rebellion, largely remained out of the public eye until in 2014 during which he attempted a coup on the then-elected parliament. His largely secular, anti-Islamist, militaristic strongman image mirrors that of Egypt\u2019s Sisi (who backs him, along with the UAE, Russia, and France). His supporters see him as the solution to Libya\u2019s security situation, but to his detractors he is a tyrant in the making and a new Gaddafi.Split governments: since 2014, when a new parliamentary election resulted in two competing governments in two different parts of the country, along with civil war. On the one side stands the militias of Misrata and other Islamist militias, who control the capital and surrounding regions mostly in the West; on the other side is the house of representatives centered in Tobruk in the east, though most recognize that Khalifa Haftar and his \u201cLibyan National Army\u201d is the seat of power in the eastern half. They have often come into conflict with another, as well as with fundamentalists.So this is just a general survey of how Libya came to be in the situation that it\u2019s in. It\u2019s a complex tale of a country struggling to determine its identity, security, ideology and finds itself exploited by a number of actors. ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to RR\u2019s reply, I can add some details from the Alliance\u2019s perspective, as their 2011 Op no doubt played a role in the \u201cplunged into further chaos\u201d part. As to NATO\u2019s role in spreading chaos, this result - - including \u201cregime change\u201d - - was an unintended consequence; NATO agreed to the UNSC request to provide protection for civilian populations which were being openly assaulted with regularity, which on the surface was an appropriate use of its force. While many consider the UN to have been the greater failure in Libya, I\u2019d argue that NATO was - - if NATO was asked to do the shooting, then it should have made doubly sure that firm plans were in place to rebuild the nation (politically, economically, \u2026) after their military operation was completed. The downside of the poor planning for Libya was that NATO\u2019s Op made a bad situation much worse\u2026 in fact, not only the nation, but the entire regions of North and West Africa, indeed European nations from the refugee crisis across the Mediterranean, were all \u201cplunged into further chaos\u201d as a result, as an unintended consequence. Suffice it to say that the Alliance has, fortunately, learned its \u201clessons of Tripoli\u201d, unfortunately the hard way; in recent discussions about returning to Libya, the Allies were clearly cautious and aware of the need to ensure coordinated and thorough planning among all parties to be involved.
