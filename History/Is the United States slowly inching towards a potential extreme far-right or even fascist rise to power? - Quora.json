            "answer_text": "We're definitely heading toward fascism.  The Constitution is criticized and said to be an impediment to government.  The shaky economy is used as justification for more government regulation of banks and business, class warfare is used to demonize \"the rich\" in preparation for higher taxes, fear of terrorism is used to justify government spying on citizens and loss of civil rights.   The debt is kept high to insure dependence on government; ditto with illegal immigration.  Corporations are demonized while labor unions are exalted.  Extreme environmental regulations are proposed to further control private industry.  Fear of an environmental Armageddon is used to justify them.  People who oppose these measures are shouted down and criticized for their insensitivity or stupidity.  Laws restricting free speech are said to be necessary to prevent \"hate speech.\"  Laws imposing on religious freedom are said to be necessary.   Gun control for citizens is a priority while record numbers of federal employees are being armed.  Gun owners are demonized and fear of rampant \"mass shootings\" is used to justify more restrictions. Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders will bring us closer to fascism than Trump would.  ",

            "answer_text": "Donald Trump is the least right-leaning candidate of all the Republican nominees this go-round, save possibly John Kasich. To think that he would usher in a \"far-right\" Reich simply because his words are what you might deem hostile is just not feasible. You can either believe the uber-progressive Crooks and Liars that were all doomed to minority-filled gulags under Heir Trump, or take an earnest look at the blowback to Trump's rhetoric as being just as hostile, unproductive, and destructive as you might view him. So, no. In America, just like with most aspects of life, we exist on political pendulum. The past 7 years have been inching further left, and now the pendulum appears to be ready to swing back right. If it swings back violently and swiftly, it will only be because weve moved so far left that the balance is out of whack. That is, if a Republican wins the presidency.  ",
