Greek culture and its most significant manifestation, the Greek language, weren\u2019t carried here as a \u201cready for installation package\u201d alongside the tools of the Neolithic farmers or in the saddle bags of blond chieftains. Let me explain a bit more. The consensus today is that the first culture that qualifies as Greek is the Mycenaean, dating back to 1700 BCE. We have written evidence of this. They were a literate culture and their language was a very archaic Greek (see Linear B script). Gods like Poseidon were worshipped and, furthermore, these were the people that Homer, or whoever composed the Iliad and the Odyssey, viewed as their illustrious ancestors. Royal Greek families a thousand years later claimed them as their patriarchs. But these Mycenaean people and their civilization did not \u201ccome from\u201d elsewhere. No matter how hard the proponents of an Indo-European invasion theory searched there was no evidence of Indo-European chieftains arriving from the North, no evidence of disruption. Instead, the Mycenaean culture is in most ways the continuation of the previous stages of development in mainland Greece, going back to 3000 or 4000 BCE. The evident influence that gave rise to the Mycenaeans is that of the Minoan Civilization, that for the time being is believed to have spoken a non-Greek language. So, the ancestor of Mycenaean Greek either came from Crete (highly unlikely), or had been on the Greek peninsula since at least 3000 BCE. That would amount to over one thousand years of non literate societies. Just looking at the amount of change in the semi-literate societies of Western Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. or to English within the span of 500 years gives a good idea of how much the culture and language must have changed. Between 3000 BCE and 1700 the material culture morphed into the recognizably Greek Mycenaean and whatever language(s) existed, call them Proto-Greek or an Indo-European dialect, became Greek. In Greece. To quote the prominent archaeologist Sir Colin Renfrew: \"The Greek culture, Greek beliefs and probably the Greek language developed here, within the land which we know as Greece today, that in that sense the Greeks were autochthonous and were ever in the process of becoming\u201d. PS. There is now ground breaking research on the ancestry of the populations that became Mycenaeans and Minoans, but that is a separate question. It suffices to say that there is hardly any similarity to the Eurasian steppe (i.e. the Northern horse-lords hypothesis) and there is a tentative claim of affinity to Armenia and Iran. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v548/n7666/full/nature23310.html For a very informative discussion, I suggest you read the Supplementary material, Section 1.

            "answer_text": "No one knows for certain where the Greeks came from. Even the ancient historians were puzzled. All we can say is that the people who inhabited Greece came from two directions: 1) the east and 2) the north. Herodotus and Thucydides wrote about how Hellas (Greece) was invaded by many peoples. They even mentioned a people called \u201cPelasgians\u201d who were not Greek speakers. These people are now thought to be the Neolithic farmers that migrated from Anatolia around 7000 BC. They were the ones who brought farming as well as cattle and goat husbandry into the Balkans. They most likely brought in significant amounts of J2 and E1b1. The areas were the Pelasgians settled were the fertile valleys in central and eastern Greece. It is believed that the Ionians and Aeolians were descendants of Pelasgians before they adopted the Greek language. Thucydides states that it was not just rivalry that caused the Spartans and Athenians to go to war. That it also had a racial or ethnic rivalry because Athenians thought and acted very different from the Spartans. During the 1980\u2019s Colin Renfrew wrote a book that asserted that Indo-European language developed not in the steppes but in eastern Anatolia by about 2000 before the Kurgans. Later on another discovery was made in that the most variant R1b marker was found in eastern Anatolia. These two hypotheses tend to reinforce the theory that G1a and R1b people also brought in agriculture and cattle husbandry including the proto-Indo-European languages into Europe around 5000\u20134000 BC. G1a originated in the Caucasus area and R1b is said to have originated in southern Russia. These regions were very close to one another. So it is no surprise that the R1b herders might have migrated into eastern Anatolia (introduced Hittite and Armenian languages) from Russia and then onto Greece. The other theory is that the Mycenians were part of the Indo-European invasions that migrated from the north into Greece and brought in the proto-Greek language, the R1a DNA marker, and Greek civilization. They came along much later around 1700 BC. They in turn were conquered by a people known as Dorians. The Dorians also spoke Greek and they also came from the north. So we can conclude that the the origin of the Greeks were a mixture of Middle Eastern farmers and herders (J2 and E1b1) who arrived first into Greece and then were joined by groups of Indo-European farmers and herders (R1b and G1a). They spoke a proto-Greek but it was not until the Myceneans and Dorians (R1a or R1b?) who created the Greek language and culture? This reflects the racial make up of modern Greeks: R1a and R1b = 33%; J2 and E1b1 = 45%; I1 and I2 and G1a = 22%. A ratio of 55\u201345.

            "answer_text": "(1) In the begining, before 2000 bc, Pelasgians inhabited the lands where is now Greece. Few is known about them. Agriculture and fishing were their peaceful life style. They had been living in Aegean islands, in Crete, in Cyprus and in coastal mainland Greece. They are assumed to be relative to the ancient balkan people, the Illyrians and the Thrakians and to indigenous people of Sicily (pre-greek & pre-roman migration). They also seem to be the same people to the biblical Philistines, who were hostile to the ancient Jews. They may be a part of the \u201csea people\u201d, pirates who looted ancient Agypt. Their civilization reached a peak in Minoan Crete and in Cyclades islands. The Minoan civilization got its name from Minos, a strong lengendary king of the island. Minos is connected with the of Labyrinth and the ruins of the Palace of ancient town of Knossos. Pelasgian language was not indo-european. It was not intelligible to the later Greeks, who considered it as \u201cbarbarian\u201d, meaning non-understandable. Depite the fact that pelasgians existed before 4000 years, some vocabulary, mainly toponyms, survived until modern times in modern greek. Names of modern greek cities, such as Argos, Larissa, Korinthos, Zakynthos are certain to be of pelasgian origin. The greek word for the sea \u201cthalassa\u201d, and \u201cpelagos\u201d are pelasgian too. We don\u2019t know any deity of Pelasgian origin. The volcano eruption in the nearby island of Thyra put an end to Minoans domination, or it just start its civilization collapse. As a result, Minoans became an easy target for the upcoming greek tribe of Achaeans to conquer them. (2) At 2000 bc, tribes that speak dialects of the same european group appear to gradually conquer the greek lands. These were the Achaeans (Myceneans), the Aeolians, the Ionians. Achaeans were the most powerful, they built great city-castles in Mycenes, in Tyrith, in Pylos, whose ruins still found today and tourists visit them. Achaeans had a very warlike, cunning and vengeful persona, such as scandinavia Vikings did. Like Vikings, Achaeans invaded and looted, or traded if they couldn\u2019t loot. They started a lengthy war against Troy and brutally razed it, only to control the sea routes of Aegean sea for trading purposes. The legend of the wonderful Helen was probably a poetic fabrication to justify and beautify the brutal story. They conquered Minoans in Crete (who were of Pelasgian origin) but assimilated the sofisticated minoan civilization. Achaeans leant from Minoans how to write (read: linear A & linear B script), how to sail, how to navigate in the sea, how to trade, how to rule, how to keep logistics for royal use and write down in Linear B. In few words, minoan infulence transforme Achaeans from wandering barbarians to organized kindoms. Achaean greeks were the heros of the poems Illiad & Odessey storying the Trojan Wars written by Homer centuries later. Achilleus, Odysseus, Agamemnon, Helen, Patroclus were all achaeans. Unfortunatelly, there is absolutely no clue where these indoeuropeans (Achaeans, Ionians, Aelians) came from. Only speculations that they originated from Ukraine plains, or from Caucasus mountains, or from central europe such as Austria. Despite the speculations, their social structure, their heroic pride of life, their warlike character was very similar to the first ancient celtic populations. Achaeans were not very religious, they didn\u2019t built temples inside their cities. They had small basic temples in distant places, near rivers, in forests, on the mountains, such as Celts of Britain did. Most of their gods survived in classic times, such as Posedon, Zeus (Dias), Pluton, Uranos, Gaia, but it is not clear if they had the same powers and persona. When their alphabet Linear B was deciphered, it was made clear that the spoke greek. Achaeans of 1500 bc used the same words as Atheneans, Spartans and Makedons did, one millenium later! It is assumed that Achaeans conquered, ruled over and assimilated the native Pelasgians, but not vanished them, because many pelasgians words used in achaean vocabulary. Also, some pelasgian population got refugee on the mountains of Arcadia (central Pelloponese) to avoid conquest, where they remained isolated but indepedent, speaking their own tongue, until the classic Greek era (500 bc).

For sure they have Genes of the Vikings.  The Vikings also stole many people to take with them to settle in other places.  Most of them were Celtic pagans since they were hard workers and  had a very civilized and creative way of living at the time. We can see influences of their travels today.  America, Europe and even the Middle East were attacked by the Viking leaders and were settled by many of them .  Vikings were in Greece, Israel, Canada, The United States and in every European Country. Most of the North Men couldn\u2019t write and were not educated that way until the Christians made it up north and Taught them  by the year 1000.  Celtics could write and left messages wherever they were taken to by the Vikings.  They were also good artists as well as workers so wherever they were brought to civilizations were created, Iceland, Greenland. They mixed in with other nations as well as the Vikings wherever they went throughout the centuries. ",

            "answer_text": "The Proto Greco-Armenians originated in the Crimea and its surrounding areas in ancient times. In 7000 BC, the Satem people descended the Volga River and displaced the Centum people from the Ukraine to the western parts of Europe. In 5000 BC, the Proto-Thracians split from the Greco-Iranians. In 4000 BC, the Proto Greco-Armenians split from the Proto Indo-Iranians to their east. By 3000 BC the Proto Greco-Armenians had migrated to present-day European Turkey, and by 2500 BC they had split into the Proto-Hellenics and the Proto-Armenians. The Proto-Hellenics migrated to today\u2019s Republic of Macedonia while the Proto-Armenians (Hayasa people) went to eastern Anatolia. By 2300 BC, part of the Proto-Hellenics called the Proto-Greeks had migrated into Thessaly, from which place they spread out to all parts of Greece. They absorbed the non Indo-European Pelasgians and the Minyans (relatives of the Hittites) to become the ancestors of the Greek people of today. The Proto-Greeks originally spoke a Satem language, but became Centum speakers when they absorbed the Minyans from Anatolia. It is thought that the Proto-Greeks and the Minyans were fairly equal in numbers, but both were outnumbered by the indigenous Pelasgians (who contributed a few non Indo-European words to the Greek language). Before the Pelasgians arrived in Greece in 7000 BC from the Middle East, the country was inhabited by relatives of the Basques. The newcomers drove the Vasconics to the north, where they started the Cucuteni culture. The Greco-Armenians who remained behind in the Ukraine joined the Iranians and became the tribe known as the Alani. The name of the Hellenes is said to mean \u201cthe bright ones,\u201d but could also be a dialectical distortion of the old PIE word \u201cArya,\u201d which means \u201cnoble.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There is a \u201ccompendium\u201d of pre-Hellenic populations in Greece/the Greek world of which the knowledge of their origin varies greatly. Most Aegean islands and coastal areas were inhabited by Pelasgians. Much of the later Greek pantheon, city names and mythical figures appear to have a pre-Hellenic substrate based on Pelasgian. For example, Odysseus and its various iterations (such as Ulysses) have no apparent Indo-European etymology, as well as deities such as Poseidon or cities like Halicarnassus. The Pelasgians were Hellenized after the arrival of the Indo-European-speaking Greek ancestors in what is now modern day Thessaly which is mostly accepted as the \u201cproto-Greek\u201d area. From there we have the Mycenaean period of Greece. In places like Cyprus and Crete, there were completely different indigenous peoples which were called Eteocypriots and Eteocretans (Minoans) respectively by the ancient Greeks. The names roughly translate to \u201ctrue Cypriots/Cretans\u201d as in the original inhabitants before extensive Mycenaean settlement and further Hellenization of the islands. Indigenous Cypriots and Cretans probably arrived in their respective area of settlement from Anatolia (and the Levant in the case of Cyprus) thousands of years earlier and were actually completely different entities during most of the Bronze Age, so we can clearly mark the differences with their contemporary Mycenaean Greece. Further Greek communities around the Mediterranean arose in about the same manner after the extensive Greek colonization of the 8th-6th century BC. Now, as for the Indo-European part of the ordeal, it\u2019s also mostly speculatory, but the populations that did eventually migrate towards Greece seemed to have come from an area around southeastern Ukraine, close to the Caucasus (which is one of the probable initial homelands of Indo-European peoples). Much like the Pelasgians, we don\u2019t actually know anything further about prior chronology of those people\u2019s migrations other than hypothetical migratory paths of much earlier humans from Africa to Eurasia.

            "answer_text": "The answer is from Two directions The 1st one is the North (South-southwest Ukraine) And the 2nd one is from Caucasian region It's proven a DNA association between Greek and Thracian DNA Also Strabo confirmed that Thracians are the Ancestors of the Mycenaeans (Personally I support the same for the Epirotes, Macedonians and Dorians too because they came from Today's Serbia) Macedonians and Epirotes were living in fortified hills as the Thracians did Pelasgians and descendants were known as \u201cSea peoples\u201d during Bronze age. And the \u201cSherdn\u201d tribe, was originated from Sardis which has been founded around 1500 BC, and not from Sardinia as some people may support, because it can't simply make sense with any possible scenario. I noticed Thracian+Pelasgian culture equals Mycenaeans with evidence of : Same Animal art ,Weapons except Sica ,Phalx and Romphaia, the Helmets and the armours **In certain regions such as today's central and northern Greece (Leather light armour to not at all) Also the Dacian masonry has close links to the Cyclopean and Athenian walls with the descriptions and photos given. Fun fact : Spartans had no walls in their cities and when an Athenian asked their king Lykourgos where are the City walls, He showed the Spartan citizens hoplite training. Herodotus believes that Greeks were descended from Pelasgians too, because they couldn't just entered the Balkans and like that and stole traditions and culture. **These Proto-Greeks were described as Barbarians from the earlier Greeks because of different language and a few different traditions Pelasgians had a small population compared to the other Greek or any Hellenic tribes from a point and after, I don't know why but Pelasgians didn't participate in any of the Olympics (but the Thracians did!) Greeks believed that Pelasgians were indigenous people that they lived Way before they did. Without a question the Hellenic World was Big and very, very rich of culture and differences between certain locations Also they never waged war on each other as \u201cdifferent nationalities\u201d (they acknowledged the ownership of common ancestor). I found a Roman sentence in a book that described how the Traeci and Graeci were similar and the Bistonian tribe impaled Roman heads in front of the lake Bistonida. Also the fact that they marked their bodies when they lost fights against Illyrians, Scythians Germans (Dadians had contact with Germanic tribes) and Celts but not with the Greeks. Their names were also seeming very Greek and only a couple could be recognisable that they were Thracian. Also the Sea people list included the tribe \u201cTusci\u201d which relates directly with Etruscans, because Greeks described them as Pirates from the Aegean and even in mythology Lydos and Tyrrhenos are sons of Zeus Their masonry was also close related to the Doric one. Masonry methods can't just be imported just like the fighting troops or warfare materials. Because it simply influences the whole lifestyle of the locals. I'm screaming the fact, that Greeks didn't give mythical origins to people that they weren't related to. Paeon was also son of Endymiona, king of Peloponnesians. Paeonians had a great status in Greek mythology, but Paeon was also brother of Hellen (ethnic leader of Hellenes) also their names were seeming Greek. And actually no, Greeks didn't \u201c\u201dHellenify\u201d\u201d names but just adding Greek pronunciation and letters that made the name more vocally aesthetic and that's another reason modern and Koine Greek language barely have any \u201crough\u201d words. We don't change the intonation of the names just like the Englishmen do. These are boom facts Also dear People: Don't take always my messages as cold and scientific Because we are here TO DICUSS And that's what the Historians are doing and get their results, THEY DISCUSS believe it or not. So don't pick the most neutral and stable answer you can find because It's also based on majority's opinions. Make your own research and then discuss. So I end it up with 4 possible scenarios. Either the Indo-European theory of common origin is false. Maybe Pelasgians did follow the same route as Indo-Europeans. Or they were Proto Indo-Europeans, related with Hellenes. And it's also possible that the Indo-European immigration dates were messed up and simply, have been made centuries or even a millenia before the scientific guessings. It's messed up butI support that they have connections by blood with Pelasgians. ",

The Minoans and Mycenaeans descended mainly from early Neolithic farmers, likely migrating thousands of years prior to the Bronze Age from Anatolia, in what is today modern Turkey. \"Minoans, Mycenaeans, and modern Greeks also had some ancestry related to the ancient people of the Caucasus, Armenia, and Iran. This finding suggests that some migration occurred in the Aegean and southwestern Anatolia from further east after the time of the earliest farmers,\" said Lazaridis. While both Minoans and Mycenaeans had both \"first farmer\" and \"eastern\" genetic origins, Mycenaeans traced an additional minor component of their ancestry to ancient inhabitants of Eastern Europe and northern Eurasia. This type of so-called Ancient North Eurasian ancestry is one of the three ancestral populations of present-day Europeans, and is also found in modern Greeks.\u201d -Ancient DNA analysis reveals Minoan and Mycenaean origins The Greeks really do have near-mythical origins, ancient DNA reveals Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans ",

            "answer_text": "It is important to separate theory from documented evidence. I don\u2019t often get into theoretical ideas when dealing with history because then anyone can say anything, come up with whatever theory. Greeks support that their first rulers was Minos, but the only historical thing about Minos that is documented is that the name is linked to Menes, Mines, aka Namer, of 1st Dynasty Ancient Egypt, who coincidentally shows himself subduing foreigners on his tablet: Narmer - Wikipedia. I leave that to your discretion to come to whatever conclusion. Also, there is a book tittle: Black Spark White Fire that has some factual tidbits. What is un-mistaking-ly true is that the Greeks got their entire culture and belief system from Ancient Egypt and later tried to remake the system with ideas of gods and godess; an impotent revolt/plea for individual independence that children often go through in finding themselves; and they succeeded in creating their renditions, though it failed miserably and was later over taken by Romans, pretty quickly in comparison to Ancient Egyptian 5000+ years of being standards. What the Greeks could not reinvent was the AlphaBet and language they were given. Though at a lose of its many complexities, they did manage to degrade it and it degraded all the way to English, one of the most lazy forms of offspring dialects from Ancient Africa. I agree with Harriet R. Fleshenburg about the All People from Africa part (As backed by scientific evidence), not so much with Space Astronauts and her other theories.

            "answer_text": "Ancient Hellenes (and therefore Greeks) were most likely descendants of Neolithic Anatolian farmers. They were related to other peoples such as the Thracians, Illyrians, Dalmatians and probably the Hittites as well (in a more distinct way however). Study results show that Minoans and Mycenaeans were genetically highly similar - but not identical - and that modern Greeks descend from these populations. The Minoans and Mycenaeans descended mainly from early Neolithic farmers, likely migrating thousands of years prior to the Bronze Age from Anatolia, in what is today modern Turkey. However, Greeks of mainland Greece show some more Steppe admixture, around 20%. Which is not a very huge number but not a negligible one. In archaeogenetic studies, Greco-Armenian speakers diverged from the Proto-Indo-European language family around 5300\u20135000 BC coinciding with the Neolithic spread of agriculture from Asia Minor to Greece with Greek developing into a separate language before 4000 BC.

In that respect, Greeks are similar to modern Americans. Each American's ancestors were either indigenous or they came from a number of other places (from England, to Italy, Iran, China, or the Congo, or all of the above). But those who came over, or their descendants, integrated in situ to become members of a new group and forgo their previous ethnicities. For the Greeks, the same process started about 5,000 years ago and is continuing to this day. ",

The baren mountains and narrow valleys of mainland Greece and the numerous islands in blue and sparkling water of the Aegean had been uninterruptedly inhabited since the paleolithic age. What we today call the Hellenic civilization is the time period from the end of the Mycenean world 1200 BCE to the of Alexander the Great. The evidence point to a much earlier civilization of the paleolithic era more than 10000 BC. There is not and can not be a set date when Greek civilization started as if by magic. It was a process which took thousands of years and went through various stages. Every year new evidence come to light giving us more information and insight into the Hellenic world. There is a saying in Greece, not only in mainland Greece but anywhere in the Hellenic world, no matter where you dig you\u2019ll find a piece of Greece. Trying to set a date is futile. Every time some archaeological finds come to the surface pointing to a particular chronological era new finding to come to light pointing to an even earlier era. Suffice to say that Hellenic civilization is as old as the world and let yourself enjoy the gifts this civilization gave to humanity. Don\u2019t envy the Greeks. For they bear such a heavy burden of their civilization too heavy to carry alone. ",
