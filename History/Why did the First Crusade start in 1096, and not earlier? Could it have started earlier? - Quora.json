            "answer_text": "On 27 November 1095, Pope Urban II gave a speech at the Council of Clermont. There is no transcript of what he said, but the result was roughly two centuries of ostensibly religiously motivated warfare in the eastern Mediterranean, a period we now call \"the Crusades.\" Again, we don't know exactly what Urban said, but we do have some of his letters. They don't seem to emphasize Jerusalem all that much, which puts the words that we know to be Urban's own at considerable odds with the words medieval historians ascribed to him.[1] What Urban did talk about was \"liberating the eastern churches.\" The wording here is actually quite important, because the nakedly temporal aspect of the Crusades gets rather obscured if you think about them as an attempt to retake Jerusalem. That said, we need roughly eight centuries' worth of context to explain this. The Western Roman Empire is generally considered to have ended in 476, or at least, that's generally the year given for it when someone asks for a year. However, the Western Roman Empire had really been in decline since its inception in 395,[2] which itself was a legacy of the Crisis of the Third Century.[3] The Crisis of the Third Century had led to the roads not getting patrolled very well, which meant that they were less safe, which meant that there were fewer merchants going along them, which meant that fewer people could support themselves in trading hubs. This last point essentially came out to cities shrinking, which meant decreased tax revenue, which meant less ability to afford patrols along the roads. It was a vicious cycle, and the result was that even by the 300's - before the Empire split - large sections of the western chunk of the Roman Empire had already become recognizably feudal[4] in nature. This raises the question as to why the Eastern Roman Empire - also known as the Byzantine Empire - didn't fall into the same problem. To some extent, it did. However, it was a much lesser extent because the eastern chunk of the Roman Empire had always been the wealthier half, which is to say that while traders might have faced a bit more danger during the Crisis of the Third Century and afterward, the profit margin did a much better job of making up for it in the east than it did in the west. So while the Western Roman Empire progressively decentralized and was eventually hacked into several successor states,[5] the Byzantine Empire actually stayed together quite well. This obviously had major effects, including on the religion of the time. The churches in the east[6] remained part of the state religion of a large, powerful empire. The churches in the west did not. So for a good long while, the churches in the east answered to the nearest patriarch who in turn had to answer to the Byzantine Emperor. On the other hand, the churches in the west answered to their nearest patriarch - the Pope - who didn't consistently have to answer to anyone.[7] This meant that the Papacy was free to start exercising all the temporal power it could acquire without ever really being overruled by someone else - a power that did not fall to the Patriarch of Constantinople. So from about 860 to about 1050, the Papacy concerned itself very much with temporal affairs[8] and built up a decent power base in the west. Also during this time, the decentralization of western Europe halted and began to reverse course. Essentially, before about 1050, even if the Pope had called for a Crusade, he wouldn't necessarily have had very much of an audience, and even if he had, that audience wouldn't have been able to do anything about it.[9] And let's be clear: the Pope wouldn't have been very interested in declaring a Crusade during that time anyway. The Muslims had set up a Caliphate in Spain, still controlled North Africa and were invading Sicily and Italy and setting up new emirates as late as the 900's. There was still very much a direct Muslim threat to western Europe at that time. Also from 1054 on, when a papal legation excommunicated the Patriarch of Constantinople, prompting the Patriarch to excommunicate the legation and the Pope,[10] \"liberating the eastern churches\" would have also meant introducing theological conflicts between the Christians themselves, which everyone realized and which would have made military campaigning difficult. So what changed? In 1071, the Byzantines squared off against the Seljuq Turks at the Battle of Manzikert. Prior to this point, while the Byzantine military was in a comparatively sorry state, the Byzantines had been able to hold on to all of the Anatolian Peninsula, which is occupied by modern-day Turkey. However, the battle went badly for the Byzantines and the Byzantine Emperor, Romanos IV, was taken captive. This triggered political instability in the Byzantine Empire, or less euphemistically, a civil war. The Seljuqs saw an opportunity to expand and took it. By 1091, the Seljuqs had conquered all of Anatolia and were at the gates of Constantinople itself. The Byzantines managed to beat back the siege and even take a very narrow strip of land on the Anatolian Peninsula along the Sea of Marmara back.[11] Still, the situation was dire, and in 1094, the Byzantine Emperor, Alexios I Komnenos, asked for help from the most powerful man in western Europe at that time: the Pope. Alexios asked for some mercenaries to beat back the Seljuqs. Urban, however, probably saw an opportunity to reunite the church: do the Byzantines a favor, maybe heal the bad feelings of 1054 and get everyone back on the same page.[12] In any event, he did rather more than provide some mercenaries, instead whipping up Europe into a frenzy to go to on a Crusade - something that Europe probably wouldn't have done if it was simply a matter of retaking Anatolia from the Turks.[13] So really, in 1095, the Pope finally had both the ability and the motivation to call for a Crusade. Prior to this point, he hadn't really had either.  [1] Medieval historians probably wouldn't have done very well in a modern academic setting, as they generally had very few qualms about simply making things up wholesale. The academy generally frowns on that sort of thing today. [2] Yes, the Roman Empire had been split up several times before that point, but only after Theodosius I's death in 395 did the division actually stick. [3] The Crisis of the Third Century ran for about fifty years from 235 to 284. That the Roman Empire survived a period of great political instability (26 emperors during that time), economic collapse (inflation was a serious issue), plague and invasion is really nothing short of astounding. [4] A system wherein the powerful pledge their protection to the less powerful in exchange for labor and monetary consideration. Thus, the local farmers in a given area gave money and labor to the local lord, who in turn gave it to a more powerful lord, and so on until you hit a monarch. The system was hugely decentralized, and kings had much more power in theory than in practice. [5] Okay, I say \"states,\" but this really isn't a good description of the kingdoms of the time. Again, yes, power was theoretically centralized in these kingdoms, but in actuality, it was anything but. We're dealing with a time roughly a millennium before the concept of \"Westphalian sovereignty.\" [6] But not too far east. Think Anatolia, Egypt and the Levant, don't think Mesopotamia or Persia. The churches in the latter region were outside the influence of the Roman Empire from fairly early on and formally split with the rest of Christianity fairly early on as well. [7] Following the conquests of Justinian - which brought Italy into the Byzantine Empire - and until the early 700's, the Pope also answered the Byzantine Emperor. Following this, the Pope answered to the Frankish kings for about a century, after which they were mostly left to their own devices. [8] Whilst the Popes who reigned in the immediate lead-up to the Reformation generally get a bad rap for being unconcerned with religious matters and overly concerned with temporal ones, they were nothing in comparison to the Popes of this time. A large chunk of this section of papal history is now known as either the \"saeculum obscurum\" (Latin for \"the Dark Age\") or the Pornocracy (Greek for \"rule of prostitutes\"). [9] Remember: power was extremely decentralized at this time. If you took your men and left to fight in the Levant, there was no guarantee that, if you came back, you'd have anything to come back to, because there was no central power that could have effectively enforced your claim. By the time the Crusades rolled around, kings in western Europe had clawed back just enough power from their lords that this was no longer really the case. [10] There were ecclesiastical differences, differences that persist to this day between Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism. Having said that, much of the impetus for the mutual excommunications came down to a pissing match between the Pope and the Patriarch. [11] The People's Crusade was destroyed at the Battle of Civetot, near modern-day Hersek. Hersek is two hours' drive from the Hagia Sophia, but more to the point, it's on the shore. Point being, the Byzantines had a very narrow strip under very tenuous control. [12] Of course, one of the issues that had split the church in the first place was the matter of how much power the papacy was supposed to have. Urban's primary motivation probably wasn't to launch the Crusade to extend his own power geopolitically-speaking, but his idea of reunifying it would have done so all the same. [13] This was going on at the same time as the Reconquista. If just fighting Muslims was enough to get people whipped into a frenzy, they could have gone to Spain - which recognized papal primacy - and fought there. ",

            "answer_text": "It could have, and in fact, recruiting for it had started in the 1070's. From a Western angle, the Crusades themselves were the product of three distinct societal pressures: First, the leaders of the First Crusade were all minor lords, knights, and barons, who were related to royalty but stood no chance to inherit. These guys had no prayer of moving further up the ladder, so they made war their living. Second, the Pax Dei movement had been in one way or another in operation for over a century, and that warfare that these non-inheriting princes depended on for their livelihood was being slowly choked off by papal proclamation. Third, up until the late 11th century, the small nations that comprised Europe at the time weren't stable enough to send the masses of troops needed for a crusade. Europe had been essentially reunited under Charlemagne, and in the three centuries since his Empire broke apart, the kingdoms that made up that Empire depended highly on the personality of their ruler for their stability. It took centuries for there to be enough of a social backbone in place to make this happen. Additionally, it did not become clear to the Catholic powers until after the Byzantine defeat at Manzikert in 1071 that the Empire could no longer hold back the Muslim tide. Michael VII, whose bumbling saw the loss of Anatolia to the Turks, was the first one to petition the Pope for mercenaries. His successor, Nicephoros III, had dementia and was unable to fully grasp the situation vis a vis the Turk, and Alexios I, who ultimately succeeded in persuading the Pope to send soldiers, spent the first fifteen years of his reign in constant wars on the European side of the Bosporus.  However, it should be noted that the theological groundwork for the Crusades had begun almost 150 years before the Council of Clermont, when the Byzantine Emperor Nicephoros II first explored the possibility of having his soldiers who died on campaign against the Muslims declared martyrs. At the time, the Christian church was united, and said no. But the matter had been researched. A century later, in the 1060's, the Pope opened the question in a new way, to see if the church could have an army--a Militia of St. Peter. The growing need for an army that could fight for Christ was underlined in the Norman invasion of Italy in the 1060's, and the Investiture Conflict beginning in 1074, when the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV went to war with the Papacy.
