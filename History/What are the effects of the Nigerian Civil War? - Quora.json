            "answer_text": "Nigeria, despite the \u201cNo victor, no vanquished\u201d mantra that was bandied around at the time, has not really healed properly,as there remains to this day,a deep rooted mutual distrust between the ethnic groups that comprise Nigeria. Of course the biggest effect is in the toll of lives lost,which is put at about 2 Million lives. Nigeria still suffers from the distrust as is seen in issues like the IPOB quest of secession, calls for restructuring, and even in veiled up contraptions like the quota system, catchment area, rotational presidency, and worst of all, the Federal Character Commission to ensure one section does not dominate other sections, in public sector jobs/appointments, instead of considering the best candidate for the job. It won\u2019t be entirely wrong, to attribute the residual effects of the civil war as part of the reasons Nigeria has stagnated developmentally. ",
