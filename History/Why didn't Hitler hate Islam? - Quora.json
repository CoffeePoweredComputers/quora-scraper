            "answer_text": "Did not hate?! Hitler admired Islam. He thought it to be a much better religion for Germany: Religious views of Adolf Hitler - Wikipedia During a meeting with a delegation of distinguished Arab figures, Hitler learned of how Islam motivated the Umayyad Caliphate during the Islamic invasion of Gaul. According to Minister of Armaments and War Production Albert Speer, Hitler wished that the Caliphate had won the Battle of Tours against the Franks in 732: \"The Mohammedan religion would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?\" \"Had Charles Martel not been victorious at Poitiers \u2014 already, you see, the world had fallen into the hands of the Jews, so gutless a thing was Christianity ! \u2014 then we should in all probability have been converted to Mohammedanism, that cult which glorifies heroism and which opens the seventh Heaven to the bold warrior alone. Then the Germanic races would have conquered the world. Christianity alone prevented them from doing so.\" According to Speer, Hitler was convinced that had Islam taken root in central Europe at this time, the Germanic people would have become the \"heirs of that religion\" with Islam being \"perfectly suited to the Germanic temperament\". Hitler said that while the Arabs, on account of their \"racial inferiority\", would have been unable to handle the harsh climate and conditions of the region, and that instead the Islamized Germans would have \"stood at the head of this Mohammedan Empire\". A \"religion that believed in spreading the faith by the sword and in subjugating all nations to that faith\". ",

He would have viewed the Arab people as inferior to the Aryan ideal, as Jewish people were inferior. However, iirc his bigotry was mainly opportunistic and focused on race not religion. It is easy to get confused because \u201cJewish\u201d is a name for a people and culture as well as a name for a religion. Whether he actually hated Arabs or not, Nazi Germany\u2019s relations with the Arab World in WWII was complicated to say the least. Basically, where they were aligned it was because they hated someone else more than each other. ",
