            "answer_text": "A solar eclipse happens when the sun, moon and earth are collinear with the moon in between the two. At the time of a solar eclipse, we are not able to see the sun completely because the moon is blocking the view of the sun. There are two types of solar eclipses. Partial eclipseTotal eclipseBecause the orbit of the earth is somewhat tilted the moon does not completely block the sun and this is when we see the partial eclipse. And when the orbit is such that the moon completely blocks the sun it\u2019s called the total eclipse. Below is the image which shows partial solar eclipse when the moon passes from the plane above the sun.  The image below shows when the moon passes from the plane below the sun.  Earth is not exactly at the center of the orbit in which the moon rotates. When the earth and moon are closest it\u2019s called perigee and when its farthest it\u2019s called apogee. The below image depicts when the moon is at apogee, when the moon seems to be smaller and hence we can see the periphery of the sun. Also called an annular eclipse.  The below image depicts when the moon is at perigee, when the moon seems to be bigger in size and hence totally blocks the sun. Also called a total solar eclipse.  It is one of nature\u2019s beautiful phenomena. Never miss a chance to observe it and I hope you enjoy it. ",

            "answer_text": "A solar eclipse happens when the moon gets in the way of the sun's light and casts its shadow on Earth. That means during the day, the moon moves over the sun and it gets dark. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon gets between Earth and the sun, and the moon casts a shadow over Earth. A solar eclipse can only take place at the phase of new moon, when the moon passes directly between the sun and Earth and its shadows fall upon Earth's surface Approximately once every 18 months It is a popular misconception that the phenomenon of a total eclipse of the sun is a rare occurrence. Quite the contrary. Approximately once every 18 months (on average) a total solar eclipse is visible from some place on the Earth's surface. That's two totalities for every three years. ",
