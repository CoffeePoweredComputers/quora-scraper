            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define smart. Many Founding Fathers were sharp, clever, and/or intelligent. Some were educated; others were not. Of those who received schooling, Charles Carroll of Carrollton may have been the most formally educated; he surely was the most educated of all the Declaration of Independence Signers. Carroll, who was Catholic, began his education at a Jesuit school on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore; however, during this time, a law was passed prohibiting a Catholic education in Maryland. In response to this new law, Carroll's wealthy family sent young Charley abroad at age 11 to be educated in Belgium, France, and England, where he studied law before returning to Maryland at age 27. When he returned home to Maryland, Charley was fluent in five languages. Carroll received land from his father upon his return from Europe, and by making shrewd, sound financial decisions, Carroll grew his family fortune further\u2014investing in such entities as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, roads, banks, and so on. Carroll was \u201cbook smart\u201d but also possessed an analytical and reasonable mind. On the other hand, Benjamin Franklin, with little formal education, was perhaps the most brilliant Founding Father. This gifted genius was a printer, author, inventor, scientist, philosopher, diplomat, postmaster, and more. Franklin, during his lifetime, was well known on both sides of the Atlantic. Franklin was a thinker and a doer. He created things as he saw a need for them. He experimented and took risks. My opinion is such that if Benjamin Franklin were alive in the modern world today, of course, he would be internationally famous (because he would have invented the internet), but he also would own thousands of patents, would be a Nobel Prize winner (among his other prestigious awards), and would have his own YouTube channel with millions of followers waiting to see what he would do or say next. Franklin was a creator; he was smart in a clever and witty way. ",

            "answer_text": " Ben Franklin.  He was a well-known polymath even before the founding of the U.S.  He authored best selling books, owned a very successful publishing business, invented various printing processes - including the security measures for paper money that is still in use today.  He was a very successful entrepreneur, political theorist, politician, diplomat, and a scientist.  His scientific achievements include discovering the property of lightning, numerical methods of population studies, pattern analysis of North Atlantic Oceanic currents, wave theory of light, meteorology, principle of refrigeration, temperature's effect on conductivity, and others.His inventions include lightning rod, bifocal lens, glass armonica, and Franklin stove. He was also an excellent chess player, expert string player (harp, violin, guitar) and composed music (string quartet).  His chess skills were so high, he had to be in England or France to find stronger players, he was the first American chess player known in Europe by name.  Unfortunately, there are no surviving records of Ben Franklin's chess plays, so we cannot know his precise level of play.  He was also a member of committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence.Suffice to say, Ben Franklin was an intellectual bad ass. ",

The rest saw it as an agrarian society full of farmers, and it was this that made them fight Hamilton's ideas for a national bank, which was necessary to collect taxes for large public projects (such as future wars) and to print paper money. Our currency system was a crap shoot before that. They also fought him on his idea that the federal government should assume state debts to make American credit competitive abroad, and all of this was absolutely necessary for our survival. Without him and his incredible forethought we'd look more like North Korea than the United States of America that we know today. Or, more likely, some other superpower would've taken our land from us by now.  ",

Just read his farewell address from 1797 and see how his warnings about partisanship leading to demagogic tyranny and factionalism facilitating foreign influence over our government correspond to our present troubles with Trump and Russia. He was more prescient than Nostradamus could ever hope to be and his intellectual genius was not limited to the battlefield as many people assume, although his strategic ability alone and his Fabian-like logistical endurance against overwhelming odds perhaps merits him the mantle of \u201csmartest founding father\u201d. But each of our first three presidents were unfathomably intelligent in a way that makes me think about Darwinian devolution and the cognitive effects of atmospheric CO2 doubling since 1800. ",
