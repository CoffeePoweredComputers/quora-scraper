            "answer_text": "Shigeru Miyamoto is quite well known for the creation of many successful Nintendo franchises like Mario and The Legend of Zelda. Gunpei Yokoi (something like that) made the Gameboy and Metroid\u2026 For some history, the Magnavox Odyssey was the first console and was released in 1972. Atari became a market leader with consoles like the Atari 2600 and ported arcade games to consoles, allowing people to play arcade games like Pacman and Space Invaders at home and they sold a lot. However, people started buying computers instead of games consoles for several reasons and Atari released E.T, a game based on the successful movie, and, thinking it will sell a lot, they produced lots of cartridges (I think it was around 12 million) but the game sold a lot less than expected and many people returned cartridges as the game was quite bad (It's usually regarded as one of the worst games of all time, with games like Superman 64 and Big Rigs: Over the road racing). These events (and probably some others too) contributed to the Video game crash in 1983 where people didn't buy video games as they were considered as boring. A Japanese company, Nintendo had been working with video games for a while before this. Their first arcade game didn't sell as well as they expected so they had lots of unsold arcade game machines. To stop themselves from going bankrupt, they had to create a successful game quick. Miyamoto came up with Donkey Kong, a game where an ape called Donkey Kong kidnaps a woman and the player plays as Jumpman to save this woman. Nintendo changed the unsold machines to Donkey Kong ones and the game was quite successful. Later on, Nintendo decided to make a video game console, called the Famicom in Japan and the NES in other places. They released the NES in the USA in 1985, which (I think) was still in the video game crash, along with some strange controller, called R.O.B, which looked like a robot. That might be to advertise the NES as a toy. The NES along with Super Mario Bros became extremely successful, the game becoming one of the most sold games of all time (around 45 million copies which was surpassed by Wii Sports around 20 years later). Nintendo mostly led the video game industry until SEGA released the Genesis and Sonic the Hedgehog to compete with the SNES (the console after the NES) and Mario. The Genesis sold a similar amount as the SNES. During this, many companies tried to develop 3 dimensional gaming. Lots tried and failed. In 1996, Nintendo made a 3D game, Super Mario 64, for their next console, the Nintendo 64. This game was incredibly influential and changed 3D gaming (along with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time). Both are regarded as some of the best games of all time, with Ocarina of Time at the top of Metacritic's list. Nintendo were going to do a disk based console and partnered with Sony to do this. The name they gave to the console during its development was the PlayStation. For some reason, Nintendo stopped working with Sony and worked with Phillips and made a cartridge based console. Sony continued to develop their PlayStation and eventually released it. The PlayStation was far more successful than the Nintendo 64 and it became the first console to ship over 100 million. There are several reasons for this. Disk based games could hold a lot more memory than cartridge ones so games on the PlayStation could hold a lot more things. Games like Final Fantasy (which started on the NES) moved to the PlayStation and some of the most popular ones, like Final Fantasy VII, were on it. Because of this, the Nintendo 64 counterpart of third party games (if they got one) had significantly less data than the PlayStation version, like Mortal Kombat. I think the PlayStation was also a lot cheaper and the games were too. Sony also created good first party games, like Gran Turismo. I think Sega was supporting several consoles during this time, like the Saturn which wasn't very successful. Nintendo also tried the Nintendo 64DD which failed (and Virtual Boy which failed so bad that Yokoi left). The Nintendo 64 was released quite late too. In the next generation, Sony advertised the PS2 a lot and other game companies weren't able to compete with it well after the success of the PlayStation. Sega released the DreamCast which did well initially (better than the Saturn in its short life) but the next CEO of Sega discontinued it. Nintendo released the GameCube which is its worst selling console to date (the Wii U might sell less). Microsoft also entered the game market, releasing the Xbox which did quite good. The PS2 became the best selling console of all time. In the next generation, Nintendo made a comeback. It released the Wii which sold a lot with its motion controls and Wii Sports (around 80 million sold) which is the best selling game of all time. Sony and Microsoft released the PS3 and Xbox 360 respectively which also sold well. It seems that most people bought the Wii for a few games only\u2026 In the next generation, Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo releases the PS4, Xbox One and Wii U respectively. The Wii U was released a year before its competitors but it had a weak launch. It has a gamepad which requires extra effort to develop games for which means it lacks some third party support, unlike the Xbox One and PS4. Nintendo only released a main Mario game later on\u2026 a strong launch might have helped. For handhelds, Nintendo released the Gameboy. It was really successful and one of the most popular franchises, Pok\u00e9mon, debuted on it. They then made the Gameboy color (or colour) which was a Gameboy with coloured screens\u2026 Next they released the Gameboy Advance which also sold quite well. Their next console, the Nintendo DS, became the second best selling console of all time. It had two screens\u2026 It had quite good third party support and games like Brain Training attracted more people. New Super Mario Bros. also became quite a successful series. Sony released the PSP during this time which also sold really well. Their next console, the PS Vita, hasn't enjoyed such success. The Nintendo 3DS, which has 3D features without glasses, also hasn't sold as well as its predecessor. ",
