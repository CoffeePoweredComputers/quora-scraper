            "answer_text": "Between the account of Pliny the Younger, who witnessed the eruption, archaeological and geological evidence, we can build up the story of Pompeii\u2019s destruction. It all started around noon on August 24th 79AD. A hot, cloudless day in the Bay of Naples. But let Pliny speak for himself. \u201cOn 24 August, in the early afternoon, my mother drew\u2026attention to a cloud of unusual size and appearance\u2026 It was not clear at that distance from which mountain the cloud was rising (it was afterwards known to be Vesuvius); its general appearance can best be expressed as being like an umbrella pine, for it rose to a great height on a sort of trunk and then split off into branches, I imagine because it was thrust upwards by the first blast and then left unsupported as the pressure subsided, or else it was borne down by its own weight so that it spread out and gradually dispersed. In places it looked white, elsewhere blotched and dirty, according to the amount of soil and ashes it carried with it\u2026  Ash cloud from Mount Redoubt, Alaska. This is very similar to the one Vesuvius emitted. Ashes were already falling, hotter and thicker \u2026 followed by bits of pumice and blackened stones, charred and cracked by the flames: \u2026the shore was blocked by the debris from the mountain\u2026 Meanwhile on Mount Vesuvius broad sheets of fire and leaping flames blazed at several points, their bright glare emphasized by the darkness of night\u2026 the courtyard\u2026was full of ashes mixed with pumice stones, so that its level had risen\u2026 the buildings were now shaking with violent shocks, and seemed to be swaying to and fro as if they were torn from their foundations\u2026 there was the danger of failing pumice stones, even though these were light and porous;... Elsewhere there was daylight by this time, but they were still in darkness, blacker and denser than any ordinary night, which they relieved by lighting torches and various kinds of lamp\u2026Then the flames and smell of sulphur \u2026gave warning of the approaching fire \u2026 daylight returned on the 26th.\u201d In a second letter to Tacitus, Pliny describes what happened during the second day of the disaster: \u201cAshes were already falling, not as yet very thickly. I looked round: a dense black cloud was coming up behind us, spreading over the earth like a flood.'\u2026darkness fell, not the dark of a moonless or cloudy night, but as if the lamp had been put out in a closed room.\u2026A gleam of light returned, but we took this to be a warning of the approaching flames rather than daylight. However, the flames remained some distance off; then darkness came on once more and ashes began to fall again, this time in heavy showers. We rose from time to time and shook them off, otherwise we should have been buried and crushed beneath their weight.\u201d Modern studies have shown that Mount Vesuvius spewed forth a deadly cloud of tephra (ash and stones) and gases to a height of 21 miles, ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash at the rate of 1.5 million tons per second, ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings. Until very recently, it was believed that the darkness Pliny described was an ash cloud and Pompeii had been destroyed by the ash - a huge amount of it. But then, a volcanic phenomenon called a pyroclastic flow was discovered. This is a lateral flowage of a turbulent mixture of hot gases and volcanic fragments, crystals, ash, pumice, and glass shards that can move at high speed (50 to 100 miles an hour.) sending fast-moving waves of superheated gas down the sides of the volcano and across the ground. The flow will knock down, shatter, bury or carry away nearly all objects and structures in their path. The temperatures of rocks and gas inside pyroclastic flows are generally between 200\u00b0C and 700\u00b0C.  This photo shows how an eruption column can collapse to form a pyroclastic flow. Pyroclastic flows can form in different ways, but in the case of Vesuvius, it was the collapse of the eruption column. This was a highly explosive eruption, and when the column ejected upwards into the atmosphere, it became too cool and dense to maintain upward momentum, so it began to collapse. Look at Pliny\u2019s letter again:- dense black cloud was coming up behind us, spreading over the earth like a flood. A perfect description of a pyroclastic flow. Vesuvius produced six different pyroclastic flows. The fourth was the first to reach Pompeii\u2014even though that flow was relatively slow and ash-poor. Most of the hundreds of fatalities occurred during that fourth surge. Ash-deposit analysis and computer simulations of the flows suggest that Pompeii was at the edge of their reach. That would mean the fourth surge was not strong enough to wreck buildings. The flow also carried relatively little ash, leaving behind a sediment layer only about an inch deep. But during the surge, temperatures outdoors\u2014and indoors\u2014rose up to 300\u00b0C and more, enough to kill hundreds of people in a fraction of a second. The deaths occurred because the heat boiled all the liquid in the body, so killing the victims from the inside, leaving clothes and skin untouched. Reports have cited the melting of Pompeiian lead-tin silverware, which occurs at about 250\u00b0C and the telltale charring of wood objects and food as proof of the temperatures during the disaster. Between the powerful earthquakes, as Vesuvius spewed out its guts, and the power and heat of the pyroclastic flows, Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae and other settlements stood no chance. Buildings were smashed, leaving nothing but ruins behind them. These were then covered with ash, which hardened over time, burying them and their victims for centuries  Pompeii today, smashed by the earthquakes and pyroclastic flows ",

            "answer_text": "Pompeii was a medium-sized Roman city in the Italian region of Campania. In 79 CE, however, it was completely destroyed in the eruption of nearby Mount Vesuvius, a stratovolcano located close to the city of Naples. The destruction of Pompeii (and other cities; see below) was caused according to stratigraphic studies in two main phases. The first phase was a Plinian eruption, which is typified by a colossal ejection of gas and volcanic ash high into the stratosphere. This phase lasted roughly 20 hours and produced a rain of pumice in a southwards-reaching cone that stretched for over 32 kilometres (20 miles). The second \u2013 and for the people of Pompeii, even more deadly \u2013 phase was a Pel\u00e9an eruption, which consisted of a number of vast pyroclastic flows.
