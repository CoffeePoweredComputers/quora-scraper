            "answer_text": "TL;DR: The descendants of the Carthaginians are fabulously happy, enjoying lives of unprecedented freedoms and security. They are exploring their interests and their passions, living for themselves instead of at the will of an elite class. [1]   The first order of business would be to work out the conditions under which Carthage had never been destroyed by the Romans. This seems necessary to advance time forward in a new timeline. In this effort one would have to address Sicily, the major flashpoint for much conflict in the region. As long as one of the major powers has this island the outcome is difficult to change. Rome would not tolerate a major competitor controlling the waterway there and would, with the growing resources of Europe behind them, eventually master the situation. Simply put, Rome had the advantage in land battles and an empire cannot be destroyed by sea alone.  I pick the period around 288 BCE as my inflection point. At that time a company of mercenaries recently employed by the Greek were left unemployed on Sicily so decided to go into private practice, taking over much of the island for themselves. Both the Greeks and the Carthaginians jumped into action. If instead they decided to set up a fair, just and impartial independent state we have our solution to stability in the region, a linchpin that the major states would not dare remove at risk of upsetting their own sphere of influence (this works as long as there are territories behind them left to conquer).[2] Time moves forward. Rome achieves domination over Greece limiting the region to Rome and Carthage as the major powers. Its a symbiotic business relationship, Carthage permitting access to the Sea while Rome opening up markets in Europe to Carthage. Without distractions Rome focuses its attention on mainland Europe and achieves greater success than in our timeline. Meanwhile Carthage ventures out beyond the \"Pillars of Hercules,\" gaining footholds in the British Isles (sparing Rome that distraction). From there they venture up the coasts of Scandinavia, Iceland, Greenland and eventually the outer provinces of North America. The flashpoints have now shifted and the powerbases have grown. The Middle East and Scandinavia are where the empires are clashing. It's life or death for the elites of the two empires. If they don't expand they lose their power (much like today). Also like today, the elite rule power structure leaves no room for Utopian ideals of fair play, freedom, opportunity or representation. The people are mercilessly oppressed in both Empires, more so in the conquered lands than in the home cities but even severely at home too. To expand the elite must take more and more from the people and use them as pawns against the elite of the other empire. [3] A rebellion against the Empires takes shape in Britain and Eastern Scandinavia. The people are tired of elite rule. They are tired of working for the elite, being told what to do, what to think, what to believe and when to die by the elite. They start to imagine a government of, for and by the people. Since the local elite are closely aligned with the Empires and therefore have no interest in upsetting that control, this isn't like the scenario in North America in our timeline where a local elite takes over in the name of the people. Instead this is a real and sincere \"popular\" movement.  We've seen what can happen when the people unite in a common cause. After the French Revolution Napoleon Bonaparte used that power to conquer a continent. If the people retained their power for themselves, determined what they were aiming for and insisted upon it (making sure to develop intelligent systems to resolve differences of opinion along the way), there could be little that could sustain a defense against it. The wave of \"Utopian\" values spreads from Britain and Eastern Scandinavia, picking up the support of oppressed people in neighboring territory until bit by bit more and more of the Empires succumb to the new nationless entity. Before long Carthage and Rome are islands of Empire, holding out desperately against the weight of powerful new ideas. They control information within the cities to prevent the people from being \"infected\" by ideas of just government. They make up stories that the new ideas are dangerous, are a risk to the standard of living people enjoy under the current regime of elite rule.  But it can only be sustained for so long. The new ideas are built off of common sense principles, things people can relate to easily in their daily lives. Protest groups in Rome and Carthage begin to form. At first, of course, they are suppressed through violence. But that violence by the elite regime just produces more support, it starts to bring to light the lies about the benefits and virtues of elite rule (that the elite rule with the interest of the people in mind). The movement sticks to its principles, doesn't give way to counter-violence because they realise that once they start playing the game of the elite they will soon be faced with their own elite propelled by a sense of entitlement for special power, privileges and wealth. Instead they maintain discipline and avoid violence, as they have done throughout the campaign against the Empires spreading from the roots in Britain and Scandinavia.  Eventually the elite rule in Carthage and Rome collapses. The people have taken over and implement their form of people's government (and economy) in these cities. Productivity and innovation soar as people are encouraged to explore their passions and human and natural resources are marshaled for the interest of the people instead of the short-term accumulation of wealth for a tiny minority. A renaissance takes place, unlike anything we've seen in our timeline. Differing opinions are resolved quickly and amicably with people of different beliefs and values living peacefully with one another. Crises are easily resolved because there are truly representative systems in place to allow a variety of different viewpoints to be taken into consideration when developing compromises. And people enjoy incredible freedom in determining how much and how they want to work depending on how much of the fruits of other people's labour they wish to partake in.  In short, the descendants of the Carthaginians are fabulously happy, enjoying lives of unprecedented freedoms and security. They are exploring their interests and their passions, living for themselves instead of at the will of an elite class.   [1] This is what happens when you ask a Utopian a \"what-if\" question. You have been warned. [2] This requires a bit of Utopian manipulation of history that is technically impossible given the mechanics of elite rule that we've had since the early advent of \"civilization.\" But let's ignore that for a moment and imagine the elite of these countries acted in their best long-term interest instead of in the negative-sum gaming that elite rule always produces. This would be like a large multinational corporation not pressuring their home government to insist (through military and diplomatic means) on the corporation's rights to exploit a country's labour, environment and consumers. I concede this as a virtual impossibility in the current order (which again, has been in place since the beginning of civilization... some day we should try something different) but somehow I must redirect history to answer the question. [3] This we can see continuing today, doesn't take much speculation. ",
