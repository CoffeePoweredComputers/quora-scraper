            "answer_text": "Technically, yes, between Japan and Soviet Russia as neither has signed a Peace Treaty. Does the fact that the Soviet Union no longer exists make a difference in this issue? Possibly. It would be something Lawyers would have to battle out at the UN Level. The interesting part of this could be in the legalities IF there should ever be some sort of a Military Confrontation between Japan and Russia. War crimes could possibly come in to play should they have a Military conflict and the UN would have to decide IF Russia is liable for the Soviet Union never officially signing a Peace Accord with Japan. After WWII, there were many new rules regarding Wars put into effect at the UN. Some of them are the ability to be charged with War Crimes at all levels of the Military up to Government Leaders. It\u2019s no coincidence America has NOT declared War on any Nation since the end of WWII. The rules by the UN were put into place to try to \u201cEnd\u201d Wars, especially any sort of a \u201cWorld War\u201d from happening again. Winning Nations in the past very rarely had War Crimes leveled against them even if some were warranted. There were several instances where Allied Nations from WWII should have had some War Crimes leveled against them, but as the \u201cWinners\u201d of the War, that did not happen. For a couple of reasons, first, NOBODY wanted to arrest Stalin and charge him with War Crimes as that more than likely would have restarted Fighting. Second, you just DON\u2019T charge War Heroes with War Crimes. So\u2026. Everything boils down to IF Russia is in fact liable for the actions of WWII in regards to the needing of a signed Peace Accord with Japan or if that issued died with the Soviet Union dissolving. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Here is why. Wars are often characterized by switched allegiances, periods of relative calm, and in some cases, decades of peace. World War Two was a continuation of World War One, making those conflicts part of the same geopolitical impetus, i.e. the battle for global imperial power. This battle has not ended in the least part, and has only taken new forms. The British Empire receded after 1945 but the influence of it's impression continues long after the body decayed. The United States has taken up the lead role as the enforcer of the global hegemony exercised by Great Britain, the hegemony which the German Empire sought to emulate in a militaristic rush, beginning in the 1870s, which ultimately ended with Germany reduced to ashes in 1945. Germany is today a part of the same Anglo-American power (NATO, the EU) which it once fought against. Almost the exact same could be said of the Japanese. After the war, Great Britain saw there was no reason to maintain physical occupation and domination of the bulk of it's overseas possessions, as the ties which bound those new nations to it over time were bound to be stronger if they were given self governance. This has proved the case almost universally, except for the Middle Eastern sphere, which has religious questions that have proved difficult to master. How does this relate to the larger issue of \u201cThe War\u201d continuing? Because of the wild card in the mix, Russia. Initially an ally to the Anglo-French (and later, Anglo-American) struggle, then enemy, then ally again, then again an enemy. Most recently in the 1990s an ally again, and presently, very clearly NOT a friend to Europe and the United States. Russia has a definite agenda and very long term goals in mind as to the reclamation of the Empire it lost in the wake of the collapse of the USSR, and, brazenly perhaps, the \u201cWest\u201d seems to think it can stand in the way of this happening. So you see, the conflicts and wars in the former colonial territories of Great Britain (India, Pakistan, Africa, The Middle East) France (Indochina, Africa, The Middle East), Russia, Japan (the Korean peninsula was once wholly dominated by the Japanese Empire and it's division is a result of the dissolution of that empire), The Netherlands ( The many Indonesian internal wars are a vastly underreported and terrible story), form one long, bloody struggle between and because of great powers which has not changed in it's nature for hundreds of years, although the individual actors may have changed alliances, or dropped out completely. Spain, for example, was the single greatest player four hundred years ago. Today\u2026no one lies awake nights in anxious turmoil over the threat of a Spanish invasion. Four hundred years hence, might the same be said of the United States? Or Russia? Will China dominate the world one day? Will India take up the banner of making the world safe for Democracy? Who can say. One thing is certain. The game of War will continue. ",
