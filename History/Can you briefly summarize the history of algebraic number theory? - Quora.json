            "answer_text": "I tried to do my best to keep this short at the start but kind of gave up. As a disclaimer, this is not at all a complete history or even mostly complete: whole developments in algebraic number theory have been omitted. Although number theory has been done for thousands of years, the beginnings of algebraic number theory as a subject proper can reasonably be said to have begun with Gauss\u2019s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801. This text is widely recognized as moving number theory into the \u201cmodern\u201d age: turning it into a cohesive field of study instead of disparate problems. New results included a proof of quadratic reciprocity, calculations of class numbers of quadratic forms (which today are interpreted as calculating class numbers of number fields) and an analysis of cyclotomic polynomials. Improvements on class number calculations followed: Dirichlet proved the first class number formula, which planted the roots of using analytic objects (zeta functions and such) widely in algebraic number theory. He also proved Dirichlet\u2019s unit theorem, which gives the structure of the unit group of an algebraic number field. Somewhat concurrently, Kummer made significant progress in solving special cases of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. He analyzed extensions of the rationals that contained \u201clots\u201d of roots of unity, and laid down the beginnings of class field theory. It\u2019s worth noting that at this point, Kummer was not interested in general algebraic number fields: he was very focused on field extensions with these large amounts of roots of unity. Next came Dedekind, who introduced a lot of the modern language we used today. In particular, he framed results and questions in terms of ideals of an arbitrary algebraic number field. Kummer had come close to this with his conception of \u201cideal numbers\u201d but Dedekind put it on a solid footing. The next broad thrust involved class field theory. Briefly, class field theory is the theory of abelian extensions of number fields: extensions with an abelian Galois group. This was developed because these extensions are extremely structured, similar to how abelian groups are extremely structured compared to groups in general. The first result along this line was the Kronecker-Weber Theorem. Although Kronecker was the first to attempt a proof, Hilbert had the first correct proof in 1886. KW says that every abelian extension of QQ is contained in Q(\u03b6n)Q(\u03b6n) for some nn. The ideas from the proof motivated a lot of results in class field theory in general, which I won\u2019t go into for the sake of brevity. The last thing I\u2019ll mention is that there\u2019s two broad ways to do class field theory: local and global. Global references global fields, which is where number fields fall. Local fields encompass the pp-adics (and their finite extensions) and the real and complex numbers. It turns out to be a very powerful strategy to do something for local fields (in this class, classify abelian extensions) and then \u201clift\u201d that result to global fields. This works nicely because from a number field we get a bunch of associated local fields from completing the number field at some absolute value. After class field theory the question became to classify broader groups of extensions. This eventually led to the Langlands Program; an extremely broad and sweeping set of conjectures related several different fields of number theory. These flavor of results encompass various functorial correspondences between different objects. As an example, Andrew Wiles\u2019s proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem in the early 1990\u2019s relied on showing that there was a way to, given an elliptic curve (a geometric object) obtain a modular form (a complex-analytic object) with nice transference properties. In this vein, it can sometimes be said (only slightly in jest) that all of algebraic number theory is understanding G=Gal(Q\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af/Q)G=Gal(Q\u00af/Q), the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers. Roughly, this object encapsulates all symmetries of QQ that respect its algebraic structure. A fruitful way to study GG is to study representations of it: which are groups of matrices that \u201cact like\u201d GG. Part of this idea of functorial correspondences is that we can obtain these representations from a bunch of other arithmetically interesting objects like elliptic curves. This has led to geometry (algebraic geometry in particular) to become an important tool in modern algebraic number theory: so much so that the term arithmetic geometry was coined to describe this intersection.
