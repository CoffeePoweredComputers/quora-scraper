            "answer_text": "Atenism was never very widespread. There was an Iranian Prophet named Zathura, or ZoroAster And Ahura Mazda. The faiths that he in\u2019s spited known as Zoroastrianism are the predecessors of Modern Judaism and monotheism in one side, and the dualistisc Jain and Tao practices, as well as Bhuddism on the other. The scriptures are known as the Zend Avestas and are written in a unique scriptural language known as Avestan. Similar to many nearby languages, this language seems to be a key to unraveling the origins of Bhuddist Theology and Western Esoteric thought as well. The Zoroastrian priests often carried staff with golden cows on them, and the Prophet Zathura is often depicted as such. So the early iconography surrounding Ahura Mazda seems to closely resemble Assyrian and Babylonian Sky God Imagery, Particularly that of Enlil and Marduk. ",
