            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think anyone knows for sure, but the Low Countries, Burgundy, Switzerland, Italy and Germany have been fought over since Francia was divided into three parts upon the death of Louis I. The middle zone of Europe was, until the unifications of its primary constituents of Germany and Italy, a military and political battleground between France and the Holy Roman Empire, and even the various states making up the fragmented zone vied for power amongst themselves. Thus, even though this region was truly regularly contested for barely 1000 years and is a comparatively minuscule part of the world, former Middle Francia (plus Italy and Germany) is likely to have been the most fought-over part of the world in history.
