            "answer_text": "First, I will answer the question as if you had asked: Who is responsible for the pandemic? China is responsible. Not the Democrats and not the Republicans. Was the response wrong? That is not specific because there were many things that the Trump Administration has done in response to the pandemic and each needs to be evaluated based upon what we knew about the virus at the time. In January Trump told a reporter that he knew that it was a lot more infectious than the flu but he did not want to cause a panic. In hind sight we can criticize that action. However, he has been criticized for not listening to the experts. Yet on this score, he listened to Fauci who publicly declared that this pandemic was not something the public needs to worry about. Even though Fauci was the most knowledgeable immunologist and infectious disease doctor in the country, he was wrong.In late January Trump closed travel to the U.S. from China. Biden criticized that action and accused Trump of being xenophobic and a fear monger. Fauci indicated Trump\u2019s decision to close travel from China was a good decision and probably saved hundreds of thousands of lives.Fauci and Birx told Trump that the biggest concern was to make sure we had the necessary PPE and hospital beds to handle those who will be hospitalized. Trump acted with amazing speed by invoking the Emergency Production Act to forge partnerships with private industry to produce an overwhelming amount of PPE. He worked with the governors to provide what they requested even though their requests for things like ventilators were far more than were ever needed.Trump mobilized two large hospital ships to the large cities that requested help for hospital beds. These ended up not being needed.Trump was told by Fauci and Birx that we could \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of the spread of the COVID-19 virus if we closed down for 2 weeks. Trump did just that and the curve has been flattened. This \u201cflatten the curve\u201d strategy from the experts was an acknowledgement that we could not stop the virus but we would be able to slow it down so that we did not overwhelm the healthcare system. Did Trump take the action that the experts recommended. Was it mishandled? No. We successfully flattened the curve and never got close to having our healthcare system being overwhelmed.Fauci recommended to the American people that they should not wear masks. Was he wrong? Did he say it to avoid panic? Who knows? The point is that it is not fair to do as Biden has done and blame all 200,000 plus deaths on Trump as if Trump was the one who manufactured the vicus himself.Fauci favored the lockdown but even the director of the World Health Organization NOW has indicated that the lockdown strategy was not good due to all the other side effects. So back and forth the experts go with \u201cDon\u2019t wear a mask\u201d to \u201cWear a mask.\u201d Experts have been on both sides of the issue at different times about the shut-down strategy.Was it a mistake on Trump\u2019s part to allow the state governors the right to decide for their own state as to whether, when, and how much to shut down? Actually, that was not a bad decision and even Biden has admitted that his so called \u201cnational strategy\u201d would be applied based upon where there were hot spots in the nation.",

            "answer_text": "I think it is a sad question , when a virus that came purposely from the Chinese Communist Party , and the virus was withheld from the world community for months while the CCP closed all travel within China \u2026. WHY you ask , because they wanted to stop the spread in China , and yet their planes fly all over the world , with some carrying the virus \u2026. Who is responsible the Chinese Communists , no one else \u2026 You have bought into a false narrative , over two hundred countries had to handle this virus , and not a single president or party was blamed for the deaths that occurred . only the democratic party whose ability to stay with the truth is severely compromised . Last thought ,,, Trump and his professional team , had lower death rates than all of the other western nations ,,, and that is the truth \u2026. What does it mean , it means we have a very robust medical system , and we adapted quicker than many other countries \u2026 There were two hundred countries involved , and every president took its lead from other countries , but when the dust cleared , everyone knew who to blame \u2026. china , China , and China \u2026. Presidents could only react to the knowledge of the moment ,,,, just the same as Biden who chastised Trump for shutting down China travels and then Europe \u2026. He called Trump a xenophobe , and said he would of never have done that if he were the president \u2026.. although Fauci said it probably saved tens of thousands of lives \u2026 Politics and Medicine are not compatible , and every American who does not use Group Think , will know that blaming Trump or any President is silly , and takes juvenile thinking to believe \u2026 Here is a preview of something you will never see on CNN. Trump Leads Biden to Make a Statement That Will Likely Cost Him the Electionhttps://redstate.com/nick-arama/2020/10/23/267862-n267862 ",
