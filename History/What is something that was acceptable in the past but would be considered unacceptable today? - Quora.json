            "answer_text": "Popular songs sung by adult men about their love for teenage girls, a dissonance in values highlighted by this SNL sketch:  It\u2019s sort of forgotten today that, in the years closer to the mid-20th century, it was not uncommon for young women to marry before they\u2019d even reached 20, even more so in the areas of the country where rock \u2019n\u2019 roll got its start (Not that this was unique to rock\u2019n\u2019roll, as the huge success Maurice Chevalier had with \u201cThank Heaven for Little Girls\u201d, a song that in its original context sounds unimaginably creepy now). I also think that as a consequence of the war, a lot of older veterans who\u2019d had to put off marriage took younger brides, often from overseas, which tended to make the practice more palatable at home where it might not otherwise have been. But we have left those times behind for an era in which women are presumed as likely as men to be planning on college and starting a career afterwards at that time of their lives. So, proclaiming this sort of ephebophilic love in song no longer seems as romantic as it might have even as late as Benny Mardones\u2019 \u201cInto the Night\u201d in 1980. In fact, it was around that time that pop music began seriously to reflect this change. First there was the Cars\u2019 biggest hit up to that point, \u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d, in which the singer, like Doug Fieger in the Knack\u2019s even bigger contemporary hit \u201cMy Sharona\u201d, sings of his love for a 17-year-old girl. However, in the Cars\u2019 song, he is respectful of her desire not to lose her virginity until the right guy or time comes along. The next year the Police released that song of our moment (for an entirely different reason) \u201cDon\u2019t Stand So Close to Me\u201d, about an affair between a young schoolteacher and a female student \u201chalf his age\u201d (Sting had been a student teacher in the mid-1970s before joining the Police, and said he was inspired by the obvious crushes his female students had on him (not hard to imagine from pictures of him at that time) and some of the other younger men in the school, and while he never had an affair with one of them as is sometimes said to be the basis of the song he did admit he felt the same reciprocal attraction)). The song clearly suggests, from the title on down, that this is not something either of them should do, and shows both of them suffering negative social consequences before they even consummate the affair (what Sting says happens in the teacher\u2019s \u201cwarm and dry\u201d car after the end of the song). Later that year Steely Dan also released \u201cHey Nineteen\u201d, which doesn\u2019t creep anyone out as much today because 19 is still sort of acceptable, but most importantly because the entire song is built around the 30ish singer realizing that he and \u201cNineteen\u201d have \u201cnothing in common\u201d due to the age difference other than a shared interest in getting drunk and high. Yes, the Stray Cats still had a huge hit a little later on with \u201cSexy and 17\u201d, but I think that\u2019s about the last one (and sort of excused by being in that deliberately retro rockabilly style).

Jaundice - the yellowing of skin due to liver disease and skin infections appear to be easier to detect in fair-skinned people. According to the researcher, men prefer women with blonde hair because it enables them to detect early signs of infestation and aging, both of which reduce the chances of creating children. Detecting the aging process was important for survival and reproduction.[1]  The stories about men preferring blondes may have been accepted in the past, but today is a different story. Evolutionary psychology has many flaws, one of which is the concept of 'just-so stories'. These stories have been passed on by our ancestors and provide little to no evidence. The author of this paper was fed up of the stories spewing out of the mouth of professionals. He took it upon himself to write a creative assumption to see whether it would be published. He succeeded. It really is easy to believe something when the masses follow\u2026  Image Source: Sophie Turner speaks candidly about depression and her 'destructive' friendship with Maisie Williams - Independent.ie Footnotes[1] Why do gentlemen prefer blondes?",
