            "answer_text": "Why should the French do anything about that? How exactly would they be entitled to tell the various Africans populations what language they should speak? All they can do is watch in the sidelines and hope for the best, that Africans will continue to desire to entertain a certain loyalty to the French language. Besides, French was never the creature of France : the presence of the language in Belgium is as old as France itself and the first state to have French as an official language in the world was the States of Savoy (ex.: the Val d\u2019Aoste in Italy). It\u2019s forever that France lost control of French, or actually rather never had it. It\u2019s like the US dollar. Ecuador is using the US dollar now. Is there anything the US can do about that? No! The US dollar is a merchandise like any other. The US loses control of it once it leaves their borders. Now that these Africans acquired the French language to play with, they can carve it however they want and do what they want with it. France has no copyright on it. Languages are like a race. The first that get to the finish line takes all, at least for some centuries. In this part of the world, it was French that achieved a lingua franca status, a feat not even Arabic seems to have achieved despite it had many many more centuries of influence there. All their infrastructures, governments, socialization in their cities\u2026 all of that was built in French. French got the premium of having been here first. It won\u2019t be as easy as you think to shift that. If you would want them to shift to Mandarin it would require huge, enormous efforts to get there. Even making them speak English is not that obvious. You can have them learn English\u2026 then what? Will they really have an use for it? Do you think the entire nation is taking the plane many times a week to attend business conferences with foreigns investors? Nope, just a tiny fraction of the country does that. And I doubt this will ever change. People are not drones of the economic system, they have lives of their own and there will never be a time in which everybody will be a sort of entrepreneur. ",
