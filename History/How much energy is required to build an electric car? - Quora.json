            "answer_text": "So I was about to go to bed but your question caught my attention (its 3 am now and this is the second time I write all this as I managed to accidentally press the back button on Quora and all my work disappeared!) *All my calculations are in metric system and rounded for simplicity. So a quick dive into the internet and I bumped into a paper titled: \u201cEnergy-Consumption and Carbon-Emission Analysis of Vehicle and Component Manufacturing\u201d (https://greet.es.anl.gov/files/vehicle_and_components_manufacturing). Table 8 concludes an EV requires 50 GJ and 3,250 CO2 to manufacture while a normal ICV requires 34 GJ and 2,000 kg of CO2.  The Energy Density of gasoline is 44.4 MJ per kg, so it is useful to think that the energy in 1,125 liters of fuel (roughly 22 full tanks of gasoline) is what is needed to make a new EV! (and 765 liters or 15 full tanks for an ICV), these calculations assume a 100% efficiency, however the average efficiency for a gasoline engine to convert energy is 25-30%, so its going to be times four the number of liters needed. Even though an EV is around 50% more energy demanding to produce, it will save energy on the long run: The battery capacity on Tesla\u2019s Model S is 85kWh or 306MJ. You will need to fully charge your Model S 164 times to have spent 50GJ of energy or the equivalent of making another EV, this will give you approximately 70,000 km (range for the 85 kWh battery is 426 km); taking 19,000 km per year (national average: http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions_sources.html), you will spend the required energy to make another EV car in 3.7 years. On an ICV, which will take 60 full tanks (50L tank) to compare with its 34 GJ at 25% eff, so you will be able to drive 31,000 km, that\u2019s 1.6 years.  The Average Annual Emissions per Vehicle data (found here http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.php) state that an EV will indirectly produce 2,750 kg of CO2 yearly, while an IC Vehicle will almost double that at 5,300 kg of CO2 per year. You will spend 13.5 GJ per year if you commute using an EV and will produce 2,750 kg of CO2. You will spend 21.3 GJ per year if you commute using an ICV and will produce 5,300 kg of CO2.  After 10 years (190,000 km):  EV: 50 GJ + (13.5 GJ x 10) = 185 GJ 3.25 + (2.75 x 10) = 30.75 tons of CO2  ICV: 34 GJ + (21.3 GJ x 10) = 247GJ 2 + (5.3 x 10) = 55 tons of CO2  I hope this comparison makes sense to you (if someone can help making it easier to understand it will be greatly appreciated).

            "answer_text": "According to the Union of Concerned Scientists the extra energy required to build an electric car vs. a normal car is so little that it will offset after you've driven the electric car for one year. The main idea is that gasoline cars use LOTS of grid electricity to search, drill, pump, transport, REFINE, transport again, and pump up at the gas stations. So gas cars use electricity AND gasoline and create pollution twice. Electric cars use the electricity directly and skip all those wasteful, dirty, energy-wasting steps in the middle. And to top it all off, as the EV uses the grid power it is close to 90% efficient compared to gas cars' 20% efficiency. So gas cars use electricity AND gasoline, electric cars just use electricity. It's a simple fact and it's the main one that caused me to switch to driving electric as soon as I learned it. The only reason I'm driving a Chevy Volt is because I'm a one car household and I take frequent trips over 600 miles to visit family and can't quite afford a Tesla to take advantage of the supercharger network for long trips. When the Tesla Model 3 comes out that might be a different story! ",
