            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019ve been studying philosophy for a long time now (in human terms), and I\u2019m sitting here wondering, \u201cUhh, just what does it take to be a philosopher?\u201d Aristotle said philosophy comes from wonder. The world is full of wonders. He cited things like the stars and changes in the sun and moon. Today we think we have explanations for some of those things, but it seems that for every thing we have an explanation, a hundred new things turn up that are even more wonderful. Do you know that if you look at a clear night sky you can see 4,000 or 5,000 stars? Good. Do you know how many stars there are? According to one estimate there are around 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars. More stars than grains of sand on the earth. If that blows your mind, you have what it takes to be a philosopher. If not \u2014 I feel sorry for you. Philosophy is not wonder, it is the response to wonder. Philosophy is the effort to understand, to explain, the wonders. \u201cAll men (meaning men and women) by nature desire to know.\u201d That\u2019s another thing Aristotle said. If you see the wonder of things and try to understand, you are a philosopher. Theophrastus, Aristotle\u2019s foremost disciple, is often called \u201cThe father of botany.\u201d What does botany have to do with philosophy? Wonder. Indeed, virtually all the things we think of as science today originated in philosophy. In the 17th century, the very great mathematician and physicist Newton still called his subject \u201cnatural philosophy.\u201d Once philosophers begin to make substantial progress in a field, it tends to split off and become a subject on its own, as physics did. And like human children, experts in these subjects occasionally feel superior to their parents. And maybe they are. But philosophers got there first. Aristotle himself wrote on logic, mathematics, physics, metaphysics, ethics, politics, rhetoric, poetics, dance, theater, agriculture, biology, botany, and medicine. At the time, those were all subject for philosophy. Even now, philosophers are out there going where others fear to tread. There are no bounds whatsoever on what a philosopher may think or investigate. The rest of the world may follow, someday. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll show you. What do you mean when you say (or type) the word philosopher? What is a philosopher, REALLY? A philosopher isn't like a mechanic or a plumber, mechanics and plumbers perform a useful service for which they are paid a reasonable wage. In order to become a mechanic one only needs to work on cars. To be a plumber one must only work with plumbing. To be a philosopher then, does one only need to study philosophy? To read philosophy? To write works on philosophy? Is philosophy a body of knowledge? Is it a collection of texts? how does one do philosophy? one can be an historian of philosophy and not be a philosopher. One can read philosophical texts and not be a philosopher. I have studied philosophy with people I would be loath to call philosophers. I have met people who have never read a philosophy text who are better philosophers than I will ever be. So let us define our terms then. A philosopher is one who loves wisdom. So what, then, is wisdom and how does it differ from the things we might confuse it for. Philosophy is not the love of knowledge, it is not the love of facts, it is not the love of logic or rhetoric or truth even. It is love of wisdom. And what is wisdom, REALLY? Wisdom is the sort of ephemeral brain stuff that allows us to make moral judgements and to tell which metaphysical system is the correct one. Facts cannot help me learn whether there is a world outside of my mind that resembles the world in my mind, but wisdom will guide me to that answer if I can only read enough Descartes or Hume Or Kant and then decide, based on Wisdom, which if those old fellows got it right. Those men were certainly philosophers. Do what they did. Be wealthy and study every subject you can get your hands on and be brilliant and write it all down. Be like Leibniz and invent an entirely new way to do math while also explaining precisely what the fundamental underpinnings of reality are. The above is one possible way to be a philosopher. Philosophers often ask those kinds of questions and seek definitions in that way. If you study philosophy you will find discussions of this form all over the place. Most of them are better than the above, all of them are more complete. There is another way to be a philosopher and that is simply to always be asking and worrying about the reasons, motivations, and specific human details of every situation you come across. The goal is not to build up a database to reference to determine if a thing is or isn't an instantiation of a given idea, to have a cheatsheet to determine if a given behavior is moral. Those things are not the end goal of philosophy. To be a philosopher is to never be satisfied that you have found all of the right answers to the essential questions that never let your mind rest. The best you can hope for is to train your mind to be nimble and careful and discerning enough that you can think through the implications of the unfolding story in front of you and make decent calls based on incomplete information, and then be terribly worried that you were wrong, because you probably were.
