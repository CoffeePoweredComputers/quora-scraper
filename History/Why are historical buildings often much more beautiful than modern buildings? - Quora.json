            "answer_text": "Cost would be the main reason. Modern buildings are much more simple to build, while modern buildings are not inexpensive, their design serves the purpose of the client. That is why we see so many building that look similar. Several floors, lots of glazing, and parking facilities. Lost is the art of the classics when it come to new building design. How many city centers have Greek Revival, Romananesque, Neoclassicicm, and Italianate styles just to name a few. All beautiful on their own certinally but cost prohibitive in today\u2019s economy. A healthcare facility is probably the most expensive to build today; no room in the budget for creativity unfortunately. Sports venues do leave room for some very great looking buildings, nothing classical but very imaginative. Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta is beautiful in design and function! ",
