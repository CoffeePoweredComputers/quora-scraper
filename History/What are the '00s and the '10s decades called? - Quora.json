Personally, I called it \"that shitty decade that started out with so much promise like Fry's Turkish Delight chocolate but ended up about never-ending war and bottomless economic funk.\" Future nominations from me (and purely me): 2020s - The Twatties2030s - The Dirties Will the names get recycled? Likely: Mirror Online. Thanks for the A2A. What painful nostalgia. (Source: various, including my own blog) ",

            "answer_text": "The \u201900s were refered to as the \u201caught\u201d years , an archaic term for zero. The 1900's or nineteen aught \u2018s (between1899 to 1910) were also refered to as the nineteen hundreds, which becomes more ambiguous now that we are well into the 2000's. That reference seems to imply the entire century. For the \u201910s decade use \u201cteens\u201d, but \u201ctens\" is equally correct and acceptable. It may sound ackward when refering to the nineteen teens or the twenty teens. The term \u201cteens\u201d seems to disclude eleven 11 and twelve 12 , numbers we have kept from a base twelve system... unique numbers that remain likely due to our method of tracking the flow of entropy that we name time.
