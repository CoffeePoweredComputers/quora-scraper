            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no agreement because gods are usually on the backburner when it really comes down to it. Gods are the means to an end. They\u2019re our scapegoats. Why do you think people always look like the gods they believe in? They\u2019re always \u201ccreated in his image,\u201d so to speak. Compare people who believe God is angry:  to people who believe God is compassionate:  Both of those belief systems trace back to the same \u201cgod,\u201d but the attitudes contradict each other. Why? The difference is in the agenda of the people. God is the authority figure people appeal to in order to justify their own tendency towards certain behavior. Think of politics. You always vote for the guy who is going to endorse beliefs and attitudes you already have, so you can feel more right for having them. Why do you think so many clowns came out of the woodworks when Trump showed up? Because now they had an authority figure they could point to, and they could feel more confident in their beliefs. \u201cLook! Even the President is on our side!\u201d People cling to whichever version of god best justifies their current behavior, so they can feel less bad about behaving that way. I cling to a Christian God because I see a lot of love and compassion in the message about him, and those are attitudes I want to lean towards. I want to feel I\u2019m doing the right thing when I treat people with love and compassion\u2013even people who don\u2019t deserve it\u2013and when I look at the Christian God I can say, \u201cAlright. I\u2019m doing what I see him doing.\u201d And if I get so angry I spew hatred and curse people to hell, I can stop and say, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way I want to live. That stinking thinking doesn\u2019t help anyone.\u201d So it brings me back in line. I don\u2019t find that kind encouragement in any other belief system. Many are about revenge, karma, and clawing your way to paradise. I don\u2019t want to live that way, so I don\u2019t want belief systems that will encourage me to, and make me feel \u201cright\u201d about it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Many people are confused about the word God and god (small \u201cg\u201d). They don\u2019t understand that there is one Creator God where the capital \u201cG\u201d is used and many gods (small \u201cg\u201d). The angels, ascended masters, and humans are extensions of the one Creator God of the universe and are called gods (small \u201cg\u201d). The angels and ascended masters are spiritual beings who reside in the ascended realm. The human is a spiritual being with a material body, having experience in the material realm. The problem is that those who have heard of many gods assume that the many gods are equal to the one Creator God. It is noted that the questioner did not use the capital \u201cG\u201d when referring to God, so it implies that gods (small \u201cg\u201d) are all equal to the one Creator God. The Creator God is energy, mind, and spirit. It is all that exists, it is everywhere present, and everything is made from it. It includes the universe, life, nature, and universal principles and laws that includes the laws of science. There is nothing outside of it and it includes the unseen life within the human. Without the unseen life as God within the human, there is no heartbeat, no breath, no thoughts, no emotions, and no imagination. The human only sees expressions of life in other humans, animals, and plants. There are many interpretations of God but God is only known through the inner experience. Many who know of God through the inner experience, are said to believe in God by those who have not had the inner experience. It is understandable because the inner experience cannot be explained with words. Here is something else to consider: If you will think about this, you might realize a profound truth. The truth of God is above and beyond the relativity of the material-realm consciousness. Therefore, it is simply not possible to come up with a relative or outer argument, an argument that the human ego can fathom and accept, for the truth of God. This explains why so many people have failed to fathom the truth of God. This is especially true of many modern scientists who have allowed themselves to believe that unless you can come up with a factual, rational, logical or intellectual line of reasoning then an idea simply cannot be valid. To know the truth of God, you must realize that this truth cannot be explained in the relative terms that the material-realm consciousness can understand. The truth of God can be known only by reaching beyond the relativity of the material-realm consciousness. When you do reach beyond that relativity and grasp an idea that comes directly from God then you will often be unable to provide an outer line of reasoning to support your idea. You simply know what you know, and that knowledge is beyond the relativity of the ego and outer mind. Going Within ",
