            "answer_text": "The Army Corps of Engineers made 2 major mistakes that directly contributed to the flooding from Katrina. The first mistake was constructing MRGO (the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet), a direct line channel from the Gulf of Mexico directly into Meroux on the east side of New Orleans. This was done at the behest of shipping companies who wanted to avoid the snaky, time-intensive trip up the river. Water pushed ahead of the hurricane backed up in a huge wall that overtopped and destroyed the levee there, pushing brick houses off their foundations and inundating that whole area. The second mistake was miscalculating the depth of the supports for the levee at the 17th Street canal on the New Orleans side by the lakefront near Bucktown at West End. The Corps missed pinning the supports into more solid ground by about 5-7 feet, leaving the bottom of the supports sitting in peat, which is a combination of mostly decomposed vegetation. The moving deep water in the canal carved out a hole at 40th Street, undermining the structural integrity of the levee. The resulting collapse sent an enormous amount of lake water into the Lakewood neighborhood and beyond, where it stood for almost 3 weeks after the storm passed because the City pumps were overwhelmed despite the brave people who worked to keep them going. The Army Corps of Engineers tried unsuccessfully to pin the 17th Street Canal level failure on the storm, but people could see that the debris line on the inside of the canal adjacent to the failure was easily 3 feet below the top of the levee. The LSU Engineering Department researchers doggedly went after the Corps\u2019 assessment (supported by the Bush administration), proving them wrong at the risk of their jobs and financing. Further, they persistently had at least one of their engineers on site to observe and check the repairs the Corps made to the levee, taking soil samples and reporting back to the public on the progress and quality of the new work. It is to be hoped that everyone responsible for this disaster has been held accountable (though I doubt it). As someone whose house on 20th Street was inundated with 9 feet of waters and neighbors who lost everything, I sincerely hope that this story stays in the light so that it doesn\u2019t happen again.

            "answer_text": "This is my attempt to explain how the flooding happened. I\u2019ve researched the data, but I do not claim that the numbers are absolute by any means since there is conflicting data out there; mostly because data collection was difficult during that time. Flooding in New Orleans was catastrophic following Hurricane Katrina. Luckily for the city, Katrina\u2019s most potent winds and rains were redirected away from the city along with it being downgraded to a Cat4 just before landfall. Wind damage is not what caused the most devastation. The fierce storm didn\u2019t even pack that much rain; estimating that the city took on somewhere between 8-15 inches. Using the measurement from the New Orleans Lakefront that received 7.2 inches, one might conclude that the amount of rainfall was minimal. Storm surge was the culprit that created the flooding issue in New Orleans resulting in 80% of the city being underwater on August 31st; two days after the storm made landfall. Why the delay? The storm surge of 10-20 feet overtopped the federal levee system in Orleans and St. Bernard Parishes which led to levee failures resulting extensive flooding. The surge data is not precise due to a lack of data, but tide gauges in Plaquemines Parish (50 miles or so southeast of the city) indicated tides related to the storm in excess of 14 feet. While that doesn\u2019t sound like much, envision that New Orleans sits 5 feet below sea level and relies on a series of pumps and drainage canals running through the city to drain water out of the city; and levees, flood walls, flood gates to keep surrounding water out! To fully understand we need first understand New Orleans\u2019 geography. The city sits very close to the Gulf of Mexico on three sides. To explain its proximity to the Gulf, use this data to create a semi-circular measurement from due south wrapping up eastward to the north of the city (which is clockwise): To the direct south the city is approximately 50 miles inland; to the southeast, maybe 35 miles inland; to the direct east sits Lake Borgne with the city 20 miles inland from the lake. Lake Borgne is susceptible to the same influx of gulf tide from clockwise rotating hurricanes that well up the Gulf of Mexico dumping its high surge into its basin. North of the city sits Lake Pontchartrain which connects to the Gulf of Mexico on its eastern border at the same risk of major flooding from any clockwise rotation as Lake Borgne. Now with New Orleans being so close to the gulf\u2019s coast, one must also factor in coastal erosion and the diminishing outlying barrier islands that would normally bear the brunt of storm surge. However, if you\u2019ve listened to any of the coastal erosion stories in the news, you\u2019re aware that these have suffered tremendously over time from storms like Katrina. That\u2019s the reason for the rush to rehabilitate and rebuild them. The only things protecting New Orleans from storm surge are: a series of federally built levee systems and flood protection structures (flood gates and flood walls). With the significant storm surge brought by the storm, many of the levees were topped resulting in multiple breaches (because of faulty design and short cuts taken to save money). It was only three of the many breaches (I read there were more than 50) that were responsible for leaving 80% of the city flooded: 17th Street Canal (where a runaway barge struck the levee causing the breach), London Avenue Canal, and the Industrial Canal. Katrina was the perfect storm; the \u201cone\u201d that had been feared for many years. Its\u2019 landfall location caused extreme surge into Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain\u2014the \u201cgateway\u201d to the city from the gulf; which led to massive inundation through those channels. Since then, the USACE built the $1.1B Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (aka IHNC) to prevent future storm surge from coming in through Lake Borgne. Design guidelines for levees were also re-evaluated and modified to prevent lever failure in the future. ",
