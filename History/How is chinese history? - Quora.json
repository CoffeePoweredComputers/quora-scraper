            "answer_text": "Chinese history can be extremely complicated in certain way in the same time it is very simple. It has more than 2000 years of written history with one major historical document after the end of each dynasty talking about the previous dynasty. Chinese History is just basicly the generation and decay of multiple dynasty. But in specific, it is extremely long and each dynasty decay in a similar way- corruption. But each time decay in a slightly different way. In general, you may say Chinese History is quite democracy and liberal in some way that when the peasant unlike the emperor due to corruption or high tax. Peasants would tend to rebel and form a new government. (all dynasty have it tendency) Now as the old dynasty was taken off, new one came and most likely will go like a mountain and eventually(which is a couple months to 100 years) decay. (the kingdom that formed between the east and west Han dynasty and dang dynasty) As it decay taxes are being raised and governor are too corrupt, usually a natural disaster will trigger the rebellion. The rebellion might success or not depending how unsuccessful the dynasty was. Rebellion is only the finally option. Sometime if a emperor gets the power and reform, the dynasty then will last at least one century. (west Han dynasty) But since Chinese history is too long there are exceptions and weird cases. But it is basically generation and decay. ",
