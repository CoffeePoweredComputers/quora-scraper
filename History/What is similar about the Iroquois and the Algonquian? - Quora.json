            "answer_text": "The answer to this depends a great deal on what you mean by these terms. Algonquian normally refers to the different peoples and cultures who speak or spoke languages in this language family. It is one of the largest in North America. It is in tern part of the Algic family of languages. This is thought to be one of the primary world language families. This is the same sort of grouping that puts English and Hindi and Persian in the Indo -European family. The Algonquin branch includes many many different people who live and lived many different ways. Just like Russians and Persians and Spanish people have different cultures. In a way this is like asking \u201cWhat is similar about the Turkish, Hungarian, Italian, Russian, and Dutch and people?\u201d As you can see, different people in the Algonquin language family go from the Innu in the north all along the east coast to the Carolinas. Then west to included the Shawnee, Cree, Ojibwe. Then further west to include the Arapaho and Blackfoot and Cheyenne.    Sometimes people use the term Algonquin to mean the eastern subgroup of the family. This includes different people from the Innu and Mi'kmaq and Abenaki and the north to the Carolina Algonquin in the south. Sometimes the term is used just to mean the various Algonquin language tribes in New England and the mid Atlantic. Confusingly, Algonquin can also mean the 16,000 First Nation people in Canada who are culturally and linguistically closely related to the Odawa and Ojibwe, with whom they form the larger Anicin\u00e0pe (Anishinaabe) grouping. Today in the US and Canada these are some of the larger Algonquin tribes. There are about 300,000 Ojbwe related people, 392,420 Cree related people, 64,000 Mi\u2019kmaq, 8,000 Abenaki, 22,000 Cheyenne, 32,000 in the Blackfoot Confederacy, 7,000 Shawnee, 10,000 Arapaho, 16,000 Lenape and many more. The term Iroquois usually means the confederacy of the Six Nations. They were usually at war with a number of Algonquin speaking peoples. The Six Nations are the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora peoples. But Iroquoian also means all the people in the larger group of tribes who speak languages in the Iroquoian language family. This includes Susqehannock, Huron, Erie, Neutral , Cherokee and others. They lived in a much smaller area and so most of them shared a great deal of lifestyle similarities. Today, there are about 125,000 Six Nations peoples in the US and Canada. There are 21,000 Wyandot. There are about 315,000 enrolled Cherokee.  So, the languages these two large groups spoke are not related. No one has been able to legitimately connect them. They are like Turkic languages and Indo European ones. The Algonquin speakers are over such a large area that there is no commonality in lifestyle within the group. The Blackfoot and Cheyenne live in similar areas and have similarities. But the Lenape and Massachusetts were not like them at all. And the Ojibwe are not like either. And the Innu to the north were very different than the Munsee in the NY and NJ area. In the Northeast, many Algonquin language speakers and Iroquoian speakers lived in the same sort of environment and depended on corn, beans and squash and hunting and gathering the same sorts of food. They engaged in the same sorts of long distance trade. But their politics and culture were different. The Six Nations was pretty unique in it\u2019s structure. In most cases other Iroquoian language speakers were never politically allied and often were enemies. Many of the peoples within the same language family and in the same areas did not not view themselves as allied either. The Huron were a Iroquoian people who were constantly harassed by the Six Nations. The Cherokee were seldom on the same side with the Six Nations. ",

            "answer_text": "The Iroquois (Haudenosaunee \u2014 Long House People) and several Algonquian speaking tribes lived in the Northeastern parts of what is now NY, Massachusetts, Ontario & Vermont, etc. THey spoke different languages and had different cultures. The Iroquois lived on the Western side, and the others to the East. They were competitors for both game and trade once the Europeans arrived. The Iroquois gathered six Nations of language-related folks together in the Great Peace \u2014 the Iroquois League, which gave them a great deal of strength and a better position for trade superiority, but the two peoples fought many skirmishes and battles, often on opposing sides of European conflicts as they fought as allies of their respective trading partners. The movement of English settlers put pressure on the Algonquians to move West, which put them in ever-increasing pressure against the Iroquois. ",
