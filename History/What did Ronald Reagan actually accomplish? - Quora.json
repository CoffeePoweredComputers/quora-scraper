            "answer_text": "While he is pilloried for his tax cuts, people often forget that the payroll tax was doubled with a deal to fund the baby boomers retirement with Sen Moynihan and the democrats. The main accomplishment of his tax cuts were the massive reduction in tax rates offset by the elimination of most deductions that skewed economic decisions of individuals and businesses and the indexing of the rates to inflation. His main accomplishment was to once again restore the optimism that is a central part of the American Dream. His most profound accomplishment was backing Volker at the Fed when he raised interest rates to record levels that caused one of the worst recessions in American History. This was a tough decision which could have cost him reelection, but was needed and much better than Jimmy Carter in the White House with a sweater telling us to suffer, or Gerald Ford pushing the concept of \u201cWhip Inflation Now\u201d and you too can get this great button. As a country we have had low interest rates for close to 40 years now. The deficit that he is blamed for was already in existence financing the great society and Vietnam with inflation rather than deficit spending. His policies can take some credit for the fall of the Soviet Union, but they really only hastened a process well underway. I think history will treat his presidency much kinder than the current partisan political divide does. Just as a reminder that we should vote for politicians by how they will govern rather than how they run for office here is the button that probably cost Ford the election:  ",

            "answer_text": "Although he was a Conservative Republican, Reagan worked well with Democratic leaders and even enjoyed the support of many Democrats from the South. This helped to bring about a national mood that was full of hope and optimism. Reagan also made sure to appoint the first woman Supreme Court Justice and the first non-white National Security Advisor. Barriers came down during his presidency. As for the break-up of the Soviet Union and the fall of Communism, this probably would not have happened under another president. Reagan started his presidency harsh and critical of the Soviet Union, and the outlook for an end to the Cold War was bleak. But he worked well with Margaret Thatcher and together, they pressured Gorbachev to introduce glasnost and perestroika. After that, there was no looking back. ",
