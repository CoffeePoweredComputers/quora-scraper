            "answer_text": "Simple answer all of Europe does not use the same currency all of the EU does which exempts Albania, Armenia. Belarus, Gibraltar, Iceland, Kosovo, Lechtenstein, Macedonia, Norway, Russian Federation, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vatican City State (Holy See). UK(BREXIT) to be included soon. The purpose of a single unifying currency within the EU is to unite the countries under what the currency represents: the economy, the main part of the reason the EU was formed was to prevent all future happenings of European conflict such as the world wars, the idea was that if all European countries were united in mutually benefiting positions it wouldn't be within their interests to conflict with/attack each other. Furthermore the joining of the European currency somewhat cemented their economies in mutually adhered state so that the strength of any of the weakest economies within the Union would be augmented by the guaranteed relationship with the strongest ones upholding the value of their currency, this would prevent, in the main point of the economic consolidations within the Union, the chances of any super economic crises such as the ones that happened in Germany pre world war 2 that allowed a extreme party like the Nazis to gain power, especially in the case of the hyperinflation of currencies. Of course that didn't exactly help with Greece but at least on paper they tried eh? PS ( as I usually do on answers like this I have no real certifiable knowledge of world economic history( though I do have a focus on the economics of world war 2) so alot of this answer might digress somewhat from the certifiably correct details).

            "answer_text": "Europe does not use a single currency - but the EU does. I take a little umbrage to your notion of \u201chave to use a single currency\u201d as if that were a bad thing. Imagine the United States if each state had a different currency and you had to had to get you Cali$ exchange for Oregon BeaverBucks or Washington Evergreens each time you tried to make a transaction out of state. You have now erected a barrier to interstate trading and will create numerous local economic inefficiencies, raising costs for both consumers and manufacturers. This is very similar to the circumstance prevailing across Europe prior to establishing the EU with a unified currency, open borders and boosted interstate trading. So this is a good thing. I would be very suspect if the current President tries to get you to buy into \u201cTrusty Trump Dollars\u201d. I would go Crypto instead. ",
