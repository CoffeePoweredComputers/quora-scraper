            "answer_text": "People's behavior was more aggressive and violent in the past, but not necessarily their tenperament. They were violent because governments were not as advanced, and governments, by taking over the legal use of violence, end up suppressing non-governmental violence and end up lowering the overall level of violence. Governments were not as advanced because the knowledge of government administration has advanced over human history, as well as the technologies that help governments maintain control of their subjects (communications, physical infrastructure, weapons). You don't need to have a violent temperament to be violent -- take any peaceful person today from a safe country and throw them into one of the world's many conflict zones and they will soon be violent, a serf of a violent overlord, or dead.

            "answer_text": "There is some evidence that violent behavior is hereditary and unlike tribal societies where it is valued it is condemed in civilized societies. The result is that once a region becomes civilized violent men have fewer children and so the longer a region has been civilized the fewer violence men there are and the less Warlike. Much of world history is stories of early civilzations being overrun by invading barbarians who were better fighters than them, and even in WWll the best armies In Europe were From the regions never occupied by Rome.
