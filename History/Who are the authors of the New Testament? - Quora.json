            "answer_text": "Matthew was written by the Apostle Matthew, one of the twelve disciples of Jesus. Mark was written by Mark, also known as John Mark. He was a close associate of the Apostle Peter. His gospel gives us a lot of Peter\u2019s point of view of what happened. He was also for a time associated with Barnabas and the Apostle Paul. He had a falling out with the later, which caused him and Barnabas to part company. Mark and Paul did eventually reconcile. These two gospels were the first two written. Matthew was probably first. They may have even been written more or less contemporaneously with each other. Perhaps as early as the mid 40\u2019s. Both were in wide circulation by the time that\u2026 Luke was written by Luke. A physician and associate of the Apostle Paul. Acts was also written by Luke. The abrupt ending of Acts only makes sense if it ended with what where then contemporary events. This would date Acts at around 63 AD or so. The Gospel of Luke was likely written shortly before that, no earlier than 60 AD, and it makes references to other widely known and believed accounts of the life of Jesus, most logically referring the Matthew and Mark. John was the last of the Gospels written, penned by the Apostle John, another of Jesus twelve disciples. John also write I John, II John III John and the book of Revelation. Revelation was penned around 90 AD. His other books were likely written not to long before he wrote down God\u2019s final message to mankind. The \u201cPauline Epistles,\u201d Romans, I Corinthians, II Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colosians, I Thessalonians, II Thessalonians, I Timothy, II Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, were written by the Apostle Paul. James was written by James, the half brother [that is to say, the son of Joseph and Mary] of Jesus. He was the pastor of the church in Jerusalem and knew Peter and John. Jude was written by another of Jesus\u2019s brothers. Hebrews, well, we don\u2019t really know who wrote Hebrews, but it is clearly in harmony with the rest of the New Testament. The common thread that you see in these books is that they were all written either by Apostles, or close associates of Apostles. They were all written between approximately 45 and 95 AD, give or take a few years. ",

            "answer_text": "Before the Crucifixion, Resurrection and Ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ, He promised His disciples that the Helper, the Holy Spirit will teach them all things and bring to their remembrance all that Jesus said and did (John 14:26; 15:26-27; 16:13-14). Therefore, the New Testament which contains 27 different books was written by 9 different authors who were Jews except Luke. Three of the authors - Matthew, Peter, and John were among the 12 disciples who walked with Jesus during His earthly ministry. Here is the list of the 9 authors of the 27 books of the New Testament: NT Book -- Author Matthew -- Matthew Mark \u2014 Mark Luke \u2014 Luke John \u2014 John Acts -- Luke Romans -- Paul 1 Corinthians -- Paul 2 Corinthians -- Paul Galatians -- Paul Ephesians -- Paul Philippians - Paul Colossians -- Paul 1 Thessalonians \u2014 Paul 2 Thessalonians \u2014 Paul 1 Timothy \u2014 Paul 2 Timothy \u2014 Paul Titus \u2014 Paul Philemon -- Paul Hebrews \u2014 Unknown, but likely Paul James -- James 1 Peter \u2014 Peter 2 Peter \u2014 Peter 1 John -- John 2 John \u2014 John 3 John -- John Jude -- Jude Revelation \u2014 John Here is a brief biography of each author excerpted from the article \u201cThe Authors of the New Testament\u201d: 1. Matthew: Mathew, also known as Levi, was a publican or tax collector who was chosen by Jesus to be one of the twelve Apostles. As a tax collector Matthew would have been a literate person well suited to author one of the gospel records. Early church tradition credits Matthew with the authorship of the gospel bearing his name. 2. Mark: This disciple is given credit by the early church as the author of the Gospel bearing his name. Mark was the Latin surname given to this young man who's Jewish name was John. John Mark was cousin to Barnabas a prominent figure in the early church. Mark traveled with his cousin Barnabas in ministry and later in years ministered to the Apostles Peter and Paul. Mark is not identified as one who walked with Jesus yet his association with the Apostles makes him more than qualified to produce a gospel record. 3. Luke: This man is credited with authoring the third Gospel and the book of Acts. Luke is mentioned three times in the New Testament. (Colossians 4:14; Philemon 24; II Timothy 4:11) and from these passages we learn that Luke was a physician and a fellow worker of Paul who traveled with Paul during his missionary journeys. Luke was an educated man who's attention to historical detail is of great value to us today. 4. John: One of the twelve apostles, John was a fisherman and brother to one of the other twelve apostles James. The Apostle John is the author of the fourth gospel, three epistles and the Revelation. John was a close personal associate of Jesus being referred to as the \"...disciple whom Jesus loved\". John's writings are of tremendous value to the Christian church and account for a significant portion of the New Testament. 5. Peter: Peter was one of the most prominent of the twelve Apostles. He was also a fisherman and brother to another of the twelve who's name was Andrew. Peter was also referred to at times as Simeon (Acts 15:14) along with Cephos and Simon (John 1:43). Peter was a part of Jesus inner circle of disciples and remains an important person throughout the early church history. Peter is credited with authoring the two Epistles which bear his name and as being the likely source for Mark's Gospel. 6. Paul: The Apostle Paul, although not one of the original twelve Apostles, was chosen by Jesus to be an apostle and to go out to bring the gospel to the non-Jewish people of his day. Paul was a Jew of respectable heritage and a ranking member of the strict Jewish sect of the Pharisees. Paul was also a Roman citizen by birth which he used to his advantage in times of persecution. His name before his conversion was Saul and he was well known because he fiercely persecuted the early Christians. After his miraculous conversion Paul went on to live one of the most fruitful lives of service for the kingdom of God. 7. James: The author of the epistle of James this man was also a brother of Jesus. (Galatians 1:19). James was not one of the twelve Apostles but was clearly a leader in the early church in Jerusalem. An important council in Jerusalem chaired by James was responsible for deciding that it was no longer a requirement to keep the ceremonial aspects of the law of Moses. Acts 12:17; 15:13,19; Gal 2:9. Along with being a member of Jesus household James also had the privilege of seeing Jesus after He rose from the dead. I Cor 15:5,7. 8. Jude: The author of one epistle of only twenty five verses Jude was also a brother of James and of Jesus. Jude 1; Gal 1:19 His name in greek would be Judas however this is not the traitor of Jesus but the defender of the faith who's epistle speaks out boldly against the apostasy of his day. ",
