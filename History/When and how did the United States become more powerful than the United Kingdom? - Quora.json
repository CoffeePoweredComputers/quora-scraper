            "answer_text": "We need to understand the fundamental difference between the United Kingdom and the United States for delving into this. The United Kingdom, previously had been the great British empire, which had dominated nearly the entire of the world. It had colonies all across the globe, be it the Americas initially, India, colonies in Africa, Australian continent. Needless to say, the British empire, for a huge period of time, had a massive portion of the globe under its dominion. Now, the American colonies gained their independence from the British in the year 1776 following the American Revolutionary War. Ever since then, America has been marching onto the path of development and reforms. Now, the fact worth considering is that, since British empire had such a huge portion of the world under its control for such a huge period of time, it most definitely accumulated a massive proportion of wealth from its colonies. Moreover, majority of the British colonies being rich in natural resources, Britain exploited those natural resources to fund its Industrial Revolution. Thus, the British Empire definitely had acquired a lot of wealth and had subsequent development in the form of the Industrial Revolution.  Now comes the point of distinguish. The World Wars. In between 1914 and 1945, the entire world saw two massively devastating wars-the World War 1 and the World War 2. Now, considering the fact that the entire of the global community had been involved in these wars, even those colonies of the nations like Britain or France or Portugal or Spain, which had no direct political benefits out of the war had been involved in these, since their soldiers had been recruited to fight these wars, we need to bring our attention to one chief factor. That being, these wars had been largely fought on the European soils, with some exceptions of course, for an instance, the Pearl Harbor. So, despite of the nations like the United States being directly involved in the war, the property losses due to these wars occurred in the European nations. What I wish to imply is, all of the nations involved in these wars actually suffered from heavy economic losses. However, the European nations like Britain, France, Spain faced the greatest losses. Due to the economic crisis hovering in these nations, despite of their victory, these nations had been rendered incapable of not only maintaining their colonies, but also their own internal affairs. Consequence, colonies gained their independence and USA and Russia ( the then, Soviet Union) rose as the major global influencers or what we may refer to as, the global superpowers. Now, this itself explains the rise of the United States in comparison to the United Kingdom. For an instance, if you consider these present GDP rankings, referring to the website World GDP Ranking 2020 , you would see that the United States tops the list, whereas, we have the United Kingdom on the position 7 in 2020. Thus, the dominance of the US in the global community has been in a continuation since after the war as compared to the UK. Image Source: World War I ",

            "answer_text": "Probably because of WWII. The UK spent huge amounts of its money and resources fighting WWII with diminishing support from the continent as the Germans conquered and occupied much of Europe. So it had to mostly fight alone with the help of its empire and former colonies while buying supplies, materials and other resources from America under the US Cash and Carry scheme. By the end of the War the UK was basically bankrupt and had to borrow billions from the USA and Canada under the Anglo-American Loan Agreement. Everything was finally paid back in 2006. Basically, the USA became more powerful by capitalizing on two World Wars where they assisted other countries, with the exception of pearl harbor, completely without risk of attack or occupation to their own country. The two world wars allowed them to upgrade and modernized their economy and infrastructure while everyone else\u2019s had been decimated and had to be rebuilt from the ground up ",
