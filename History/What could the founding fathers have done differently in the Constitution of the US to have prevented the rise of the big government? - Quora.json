            "answer_text": "The US is much more \u201clibertarian\u201d than the Constitution suggests mainly because Jefferson didn\u2019t like it. Adams didn\u2019t like it either, but he was probably closer to the right track, i.e., stop almost everyone from voting. Jefferson thought that his \u201cNew Aristocracy\u201d would always be able to protect its interests and that has been largely true. Then came immigration and population increases. Then crop failures. Then a Civil War. You might look at this the other way. That is, how do you imagine that a tiny fraction of the population where less than 5% could vote and less than 1% could stand for office, one that enriched itself at the expense of the commonweal and on slavery, could conceivably survive? For a while, they could run dissenters to the frontier (\u201cGo West, young man\u201d), rather like squirrels, but eventually you run out of decent land. The colonists started acting like pirates before the Mayflower. The crown was far away and couldn\u2019t stop it, so why not steal a little more? That works for a while, but eventually you become vulnerable to copycat pirates yourself. What mechanism would you use to crack down on them? The modern language of libertarianism is the language of mid-19th century slavery, i.e., you should protect my right to X because you also might have X some day. It survived because the anti-Reconstruction Democrats gained control over the Supreme Court. The Lochner era court invented US property rights over 1897 through 1937. SCOTUS carefully guarded the commerce clause (Jefferson liked it. Lots of power there.), as well as, their power of eminent domain. Consequently, you hear many calls to restrict both the commerce clause and eminent domain today. So \u2026 Keep almost everyone from votingEliminate the commerce clauseMuch more severely restrict eminent domainThen pray that you get to keep your head. ",

            "answer_text": "They could have added the 10th amendment. Oh wait, they did that! They could have restricted the Federal government\u2019s power to tax. Oh wait, they did that! Most of the increase in Federal size and power resulted from imposition of the income tax. Before that, the Federal government had very limited sources of tax revenue including excise, capitation, and import duties. The income tax was ratified mostly by farmers who had little cash income but were jealous of workers in \u201ccushy\u201d factory jobs. Factory work paid about a dollar for an eleven hour day (no benefits, either). Farmers firstly grew their own food, bartered with other farmers and then sold a small amount of cash crops. Their taxable cash income was pretty small. For politicians, the income tax was a way to soak factory owners who, compared to farmers and laborers, didn\u2019t really \u201c\"work.\u201d They could have prohibited \u201c\"bills of attainder,\u201d that is, laws targeting a single individual. Oh wait, they did that! The Anti-Trust Act was passed mainly to divide the wealth of a few very successful entrepreneurs. Their still trying, but IBM outwitted the Federal Government in its ~14 year defense against Ramsey Clark\u2019s last effort to impede economic growth. They could have omitted a Federal Police power. Oh wait, they did that! If I recall, the only original Federal crimes were counterfeiting and treason(in wartime). They could have imposed term limits. They missed the boat on that one but Pres. Washington set the example for Presidents for a century and a half until FDR chose to rule for life. Realistically, they could have required that all judges given lifetime appointments be younger than, say, 50 to help assure that courts could not become packed by one side too quickly. The Founders knew the dangers of politics and governance. They understood that government would always try to increase its power and went to great lengths to impose limits - not by specifying what government could not do but by enumerating precisely what it was allowed to do. A century of \u201cprogressive\u201d thinking has turned this idea upside-down to the point that the Federal government could force citizens to buy a commercial product from a third party - Obamacare! The Founders Constitution held up for about a hundred years until \u201cpeople-who-knew-better\u201d dismissed it as archaic. They would be appalled by abominations like Social Security. For your homework, compare the return on investment for 1) a female suburban, non-smoking, married recipient, and 2) a male inner-city, smoking, single minority recipient. (Hint: use one of the \u201c\"how long will I live\u201d algorithms. Talk about disparate impact! Eric Holder should have been fining the Social Security Administration, not mortgage lenders). Fun fact - the people have the right to bear arms. The government does not. If they chose, the people have the right to disarm their respective law enforcement and military operations by rescinding the power that the people have granted to their respective governments. ",
