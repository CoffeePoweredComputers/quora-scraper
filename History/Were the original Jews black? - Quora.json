            "answer_text": "If you mean this as to endorse the lie that original Jews were Black and today's Jews are imposters, no? There is no credible evidence to support this racist theory that wants to discredit the current and past Jews who have gone through so many centuries of persecution, as if they would have done so willingly to cling to a lie. To answer your question, just look to today's Middle East. You can easily see the physical appearance of Sephardic and many Askebazi Jews from Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East and even their Arab brethren who also have Semitic ties. All Jews from all over the world trace their genetics to the Middle East, including the Jews who migrated away or were forced out of Israel and the Levant generations ago. The Jews who never left or stayed in the Arab world are often, but not always, darker in complection. They are white racially, as Arabs are, if you must divide them technically, but have the tendency to tan quite easily and have that Middle Eastern/ Meditarranean look to them. Proor to the 1920s the US considered Jews to be \u201cAsians\u201d as where Arabs, Armenians and Persians. The Europeans NEVER considered Jews to be \u201cwhite\" until after WW2. People who you would consider black today emanated from Africa originally, like all of us actually, but they would not be considered natives to the Middle East and the birthplace of the Jewish nation and Judaism by any reasonable measure. Also look to the most recent studies of what Jesus may have looked like for further evidence. Most scholars agree that he would have had the Middle Eastern Jewish look as well, as opposed to the traditional, flowing blond hair and blue eyes Jesus we have often seen depicted. As for whether black people could have embraced Judaism along the way? Sure, like all religions, Judaism is open to converts, though they don't prosyletize like many religions anymore. Through the ages, blacks did embrace Judaism and some, though not many relatively to other religions, converted into the tribe. Judaism has really evolved to both a tribal nation with a tribal religion. Converts are considered just as Jewish as anyone born into the tribe. This does not mean that the controversial, racist, and quite frankly idiotic narrative that the original Jews were only black has any merit. That's a rewriting of the facts of history. Hope that helps you. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they were, without a shadow of a doubt in fact. The original Jews were most definitely what we call \u201cBlack\u201d. It\u2019s not that hard to understand if you do your homework. I realise what a thrill it must be for everyone here to call Black people stupid for saying they are Jews but people should really take some time to get their facts straight before they decide to put themselves out there to slander and ridicule people who are actually 100% right in what they claim according to every credible criteria that may be used to establish who is and who isn\u2019t authentic Jewry. You can run to history, and history will tell you the Jews were Negroes. You can run to the science of anthropology and it will tell you the Jews and Israelites were Negroes. You can run to the science of genetics and it will tell you the Jews were Negroes. You can run to scripture, and it will tell you the Jews were and are Negroes. But, wouldn\u2019t this make things uncomfortable if it were true, you ask. Yes. Yes it would. It make things very uncomfortable, as it should be, because nobody put a gun to any bodies head and told them to lie about who the Jewish people were and are. People lie about this topic of their own free will. It\u2019s not as if the historical records or any of the supporting evidence are hidden. They\u2019ve been available to the public for hundreds, if not thousands of years. People make a conscious choice to be obstinate and not acknowledge them. Quora wants me to be nice about it all so I\u2019ll be nice about it. But someone has to tell the truth. Historical References on the Jewish people  Fresco of Christ Among the Apostles, Catacombs of St. Domitilla, Rome, 2nd-4th Century Two thousand years ago, Senator Gaius Tacitus of Rome, one of Rome\u2019s most notable historians was given a charge to draft a history of the Jewish people as the job of Senator in Rome translates well to the position of a Minister of Foreign Affairs. He had to come to an understanding of the history, ancestry, beliefs and political leanings of the people of the Kingdom of Judea. This is what he recorded: \u201cThe Jews are said to have been refugees from the island of Crete who settled in the remotest corner of Libya in the days when, according to the story, Saturn was driven from his throne by the aggression of Jupiter. This is a deduction from the name Judaei by which they became known: the word is to be regarded as a barbarous lengthening of Idaei, the name of the people dwelling around the famous Mount Ida in Crete. A few authorities hold that in the reign of Isis the surplus population of Egypt was evacuated to neighboring lands under the leadership of Hierosolymus and Judas. Many assure us that the Jews are descended from those Ethiopians who were driven by fear and hatred to emigrate from their home country when Cepheus was king. There are some who say that a motley collection of landless Assyrians occupied a part of Egypt, and then built cities of their own, inhabiting the lands of the Hebrews and the nearer parts of Syria. Others again find a famous ancestry for the Jews in the Solymi who are mentioned with respect in the epics of Homer: this tribe is supposed have founded Jerusalem and named it after themselves.\u201d - Tacitus, The Histories, Book V, 110C.E. Ideans from Crete. Egyptians. Ethiopians. Assyrians. Solymians. This is the actual historical record of the people the Romans thought the Jewish people were descended from and related to or else they would not have recorded it. Neither does the Roman account of the Jewish people exist in a vacuum because the Greeks held the same opinion of the Jewish people, only they had different names for some of these people than the Romans had: \u201cAs for Judaea, its western extremities towards Casius are occupied by the Idumaeans and by the lake. The Idumaeans are Nabataeans, but owing to a sedition they were banished from there, joined the Judaeans, and shared in the same customs with them. The greater part of the region near the sea is occupied by Lake Sirbonis and by the country continuous with the lake as far as Jerusalem; for this city is also near the sea; for, as I have already said, it is visible from the seaport of Iop\u00ea. This region lies towards the north; and it is inhabited in general, as is each place in particular, by mixed stocks of people from Aegyptian and Arabian and Phoenician tribes; for such are those who occupy Galilee and Hiericus and Philadelphia and Samaria, which last Herod surnamed Sebast\u00ea. But though the inhabitants are mixed up thus, the most prevalent of the accredited reports in regard to the temple at Jerusalem represents the ancestors of the present Judaeans, as they are called, as Aegyptians.\u201d - Strabo, The Geography of Strabo, Volume 3, pg. 177 Under the lens of Strabo eyes, the Ideans and Solymi were classified as Phoenicians, which they are, the Ethiopians and the Assyrians as Arabians, and of course the Egyptians as the Egyptians. You will see that the Greeks and the Romans gave the same report because all of these peoples were related to and intimately connected with each other, especially the Ethiopians and Egyptians. I understand why people then accuse us of using \u201cpseudo-history\u201d, because if people world-wide actually began to investigate what the Romans and Greeks recorded about the Jews free of all biases that have been built up over recent centuries, the foundations today\u2019s world is built on would be shaken and turned upside down. It\u2019s not comfortable, but it has to happen, because it is what is right. What is the modern definition of an Ethiopian in the field of anthropology as used by the Greeks and the Romans? \u201cIf we accept the ordinary identification of the Negro on the basis of color of the skin, shape of the nose, and quality of the hair: it is certain that the Greeks were well acquainted with the racial type which anthropologists designate today as Negroid. In view of the Greek usage of the word \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03af\u03bf\u03c8 (Ethiopian) it is safe to assume that a given passage refers to a Negro in the following instances: 1. Whenever a passage mentions two or more of the physical characteristics accepted by modern anthropologists. 2. Whenever the word \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03af\u03bf\u03c8 is used in conjunction with one or more of the physical characteristics accepted by modern anthropologists. 3. Whenever contextual or other evidence indicates that \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03af\u03bf\u03c8, even in the absence of any other racial characteristic, refers to a Negroid type. Rather detailed classifications of an anthropological type answering to the Negroid type appear in several Greek authors. One of these will suffice as an illustration. Diod. Sic. 3.8.2: The majority of them (i.e., Ethiopians), and especially those who dwell dong the rivers, are black-skinned, flat-nosed and woolly-haired.\u201d - The Negro in Ancient Greece  Ethiopian Man Early XVII century. Alabaster, Jasper, Black marble. Room 090, Museo Del Prado As you can see, the term Ethiopian carries the strict connotation of Negroid identity according to the criteria used by our own anthropologist to determine if the remains of deceased people are Negroid or not. One must then answer why many assured the Romans the Jews were descended from Negroes, which invites people not willing to accept the historical record of the Jews concerning the Ethiopians to point to all of the other peoples the Greeks and the Romans said the Jews were descended from as if they were a type of secret escape route out of reality because they haven\u2019t studied sufficiently to understand that they too were classified as Ethiopians or Cushites by the Greeks. Beginning with the Ideans of Crete and the Phoenicians: \u201c\u2026His ethnic assumptions are not always correct, and his conception of antiquity was not sufficiently extensive to take in the whole career of the old Cushite race, to which the Phoenicians belonged; but he wrote more than fifty years ago, without aid from the later discoveries. The lost records of this whole race would indeed shed a great light on the past ; nevertheless, it will be readily admitted that a complete history of the people known as Phoenicians, or even a complete record of Sidon or Tyre, giving a history of its maritime operations from the beginning, its manufactures, its commerce, its colonies, and its commercial and political relations with the rest of the world, would be an invaluable acquisition. The term Phoenicia is of Greek origin. The Greeks applied it to a small district on the Mediterranean, which appears to have been the only Asiatic territory controlled by the people called Phoenicians after the date of the first Olympiad. This was only a fragment of their more ancient dominion, and they themselves were only a fragment of the still more ancient empire of the Arabian Cushites. The term Phoenicia did not come into use until long after the Phoenician dominion in Asia Minor, on the Black Sea, and on the islands and coasts of the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean was broken. We call certain people Moors who never knew themselves by the name we give them. So did the Greeks and Romans describe a certain people of antiquity as Phoenicians. We can not have a regular history of this people ; but we know that the early Greeks called them Ethiopians. Notices of them are found in Greek literature ; tradition gives some account of them ; traces of their character and civilization are found in the many regions where they had colonies or commercial establishments ; and there is something for study in the unexplained yet unavoidable impression of their greatness felt by every student of ancient history.\u201d John D. Baldwin, Prehistoric Nations You can begin to understand why I said all the people the Jews were recorded being descended from or related to were connected. The Jews were said to be descended from Ethiopians and Phoenicians and Arabians. What a surprise it is that the Phoenicians were classified as Arabian Cushites with holdings in Tyre and Sidon. These very same Phoenicians left the Mediterranean for Crete where they became known as the Ideans: \u201c\u2026The Curetes mentioned here by Diodorus were, according to Herodotus and Strabo, originally Phenicians, and accompanied Cadmus out of Phenicia; some of them settling in Phrygia, where they were called Corybantes; some in Crete, where they were known by the name of Idaei Dactyli; some in Rhodes, where they bore the name of Telchines, &c. Ciemens Alexandrinus calls the Idaei Dactyli barbarians, that is, strangers; and tells us, that they were the first who brought letters into Greece, Phrygia, and Crete; and adds, that, by their assistance, King Minos built a fleet, and gained the sovereignty of the sea. According to these authors, the Curetes and Idaei Dactyli were the same people, and did not settle in Crete till the time of Minos. Bochart brings the Curetes from Palestine, induced so to do by the likeness there is between their name and that of the Crethim, or Cerethites, a people among the Philistines. The Philistines, indeed, conquered Sidon; and it is not unlikely, that some of them, mixed with the Phenicians, attended Cadmus into Crete and Greece. But, long before they settled in Crete, a colony of Pelasgians had peopled the eastern coast of the island. After the Pelasgians, Teutamus, the grandfather of Minos, carried thither a colony of Dorians from Laconia, and the territory of Olympia in Peloponnesus. These several colonies spoke different languages, and lived quietly in caves and huts, on the spontaneous product of the earth, till the invention of tools, in the reign of Asterius, the son of Teutamus. They were at last reduced into one kingdom, and became one people, in the reign of Minos, who was their first lawgiver, built many towns, and introduced ploughing and sowing. According to this account, which is vouched by Strabo, Lucian, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the two first kings of Crete, who reigned after the coming of the Curetes, were Asterius and Minos: Europa was wife to Asterius, and mother of Minos; and the Idaei Dactyli came with her and her brother Alymnus into Crete, where they dwelt in the Idaean cave, and there educated Jupiter; so that Asterius, Europa, and Minos, must be the Saturn, Rhea, and Jupiter, of the Cretans. Minos is usually called the son of Jupiter; but the Phenicians, as Sir Isaac Newton observes, upon their first coming into Greece, gave the name of Jaopater, or Jupiter, to all kings; and thus both Minos and his father Asterius were Jupiters, that is, kings.\u201d - Frederick Guest Tomlins, A Universal History of the Nations of Antiquity, pg. 647  The Kefti or Caphtorim(Cretans or Minoans) bringing tributes to Egypt. The Tomb of Rekhmire, Governor of Thebes and Vizier during the reigns of Thutmosis III and Amenhotep II, 18th Dynasty, 1400 B.C. It is a well established fact that it was the Phoenician people who sailed to Crete and Greece, bringing naval technology, language and all other forms of learning with them. It\u2019s just not convenient to admit that these people were Ethiopians, as others besides Hebrew Israelites have noticed: \u201c\u2026These discoveries proved more ancient and direct Ethiopian contact with early Aegean civilizations than had ever been speculated previously. Crete became a prime example of this thesis, providing proofs that would make it the basis for contending that Ethiopians had asserted \u201ca profound influence on the material and literary aspects of Greek civilization\u2026 Archeological synchronisms made it possible to establish links between prehistoric Crete and ancient Egypt.\u201d Diodorus\u2019s relatively late statement that Ethiopians sent \u201cgreat forces abroad into other countries where they succeeded in bringing many parts of the world under their dominion\u2026 long before the Trojan war\u201d is weighted and reinforced by Herodotus\u2019s writings on the Colchians, and both are supported by the Minoan findings of an early Ethiopian presence that precedes them. Hansberry acquaints us with the implications of all this research. The notices tied to the archaeological discoveries show a long history of Minoan contact with \u201cblack\u201d and African cultures \u201cfrom the very beginnings of early Minoan civilization.\u201d As Evans noted, the \u201cbeehive\u201d tombs of the Aegean bear a \u201cstriking resemblance to a type of very ancient tomb that had a wide distribution throughout Africa.\u201d Evans believed that these architectural structures might have been \u201cintroduced into the Aegean area by emigrants from Africa,\u201d which led him to \u201cattribute the foundation of Early Minoan culture to an actual settlement of colonist from North Africa in Crete.\u201d \u201cFor Hansberry, the research showed \u201cthat there was a large black or Negroid element in North Africa in the proto dynastic period of Egypt.\u201d The implications of this conclusion are fairly clear. Here lay Egypt\u2019s African roots exposed; and those roots indicated that Minoan culture knew the \u201cEthiopian type from the beginning of the Minoan age,\u201d and for a period of time considerably longer than the critics of the classics or those who argued against an African presence in the classical world were willing to concede. The archeology of the Minoan ruins revealed the most important evidence of \u201cAegean and African contacts\u201d and the possibilities of the \u201cCentral African\u201d origins of some of that contact. The goods of the tombs themselves allow Evans to speculate on the classical testimony of overland routes into the African interior.\u201d - Maghan Keita, Race and the Writing of History: Riddling the Sphinx  The Minoan Captain of the Blacks Fresco, Knossos Palace, Crete, 1350\u20131300 B.C. There is no anthropologist that can deny the large Negroid element present in Proto-Dynastic Egypt, that is before they ruled in Dynasties. They can deny the involvement of these Negroid peoples, but they can\u2019t deny their presence, which is all honest students of history need to piece together what is true and what is false. Because the Greeks and the Romans both said the Jewish people were descended from the Egyptians, right? And it has nothing to do with the fact that the Jewish people were also said to be descended directly from Ethiopians and Phoenicians, right? It\u2019s all one big happy coincidence, right? Just like the movements of the Phoenician people in the Aegean and Greece and the Ethiopian impact left behind. \u201cNow the Gephyraean clan, claim to have come at first from Eretria, but my own enquiry shows that they were among the Phoenicians who came with Cadmus to the country now called Boeotia. In that country the lands of Tanagra were allotted to them, and this is where they settled. The Cadmeans had first been expelled from there by the Argives, and these Gephyraeans were forced to go to Athens after being expelled in turn by the Boeotians. The Athenians received them as citizens of their own on set terms. These Phoenicians who came with Cadmus and of whom the Gephyraeans were a part brought with them to Hellas, among many other kinds of learning, the alphabet, which had been unknown before this, I think, to the Greeks. As time went on the sound and the form of the letters were changed. At this time the Greeks who were settled around them were for the most part Ionians, and after being taught the letters by the Phoenicians, they used them with a few changes of form. In so doing, they gave to these characters the name of Phoenician. I have myself seen Cadmean writing in the temple of Ismenian Apollo at Boeotian Thebes engraved on certain tripods and for the most part looking like Ionian letters.\u201d - Herodotus, Book V, ''57-59 Language and learning is not all that the Phoenicians left behind in the Aegean. Architecture is not the only Ethiopian evidence left behind in the Aegean. \u201cSub-Saharan African\u201d DNA was also left behind in the same region of Greece history records receiving the Phoenician people: \u201cThus, it is hypothesized that there could have been a migration from southern Sahara which mixed with ancient Greeks to give rise to a part of the present day Greek genetic background. The admixture must have occurred in the Aegean Islands and Athens area at least (Figs 1 and 2). The reason why this admixture is not seen in Crete is unclear but may be related to the influential and strong Minoan empire which hindered foreigners establishment (10). Also, the time when admixture occurred could be after the overthrown of some of the Negroid Egyptian dynasties (Nubian or from other periods) or after undetermined natural catastrophes (i.e.: dryness). Indeed, ancient Greeks believed that their religion and culture came from Egypt (4, 25).\u201d - HLA Genes in Macedonians and the Sub-Saharan Origins of the Greeks But there\u2019s something improbable in the Jewish people actually being descended from Ethiopians or Negroid Egyptians or Negroid Phoenicians. \u201cIt will appear that the people called Phoenicians were a branch of the great Cushite race, and that the country they occupied was originally a part of that empire of Cusha-dwipa which extended from the Erythraean Sea to the Mediterranean. At that very remote period, when the first Cushite settlements were established on the Mediterranean, there was undoubtedly a great movement of the Arabian Cushites in that direction from all parts of the peninsula, and especially from the commercial districts on the southern and eastern coast; and probably there were other migrations, at subsequent periods, whenever a new city was founded, or some new commercial opportunity stimulated enterprise to seek that coast. The tradition reported by Eratosthenes appears to signify, at least, that, when Tyre was founded, its builders from Sidon were joined by immigrants from the Bahreyn Islands and the Arabian coast with which they are so closely connected. Political considerations may have done something to incite this migration, for the unity of the ancient Cushite dominion must have disappeared before Tyre was built, and the independant nationality of the Phoenicians must then have reached that great condition of prosperity which it maintained for centuries afterwards. Linguistic and archaeological research have made two points very clear: first, that the oldest traces of a civilized people found in Asia Minor, especially in the coast regions, are those of the Cushites, or Ethiopians; and, second, that there was a very close relationship between the Phoenicians and the ancient people of Southern Arabia, or, to translate the words of a distinguished French explorer and philologist [Ernest Renan]: \u201cIt must be admitted that singular relations exist between the ethnographic, historic and linguistic position of Yemen and that of Phoenicia.\u201d These points are now so generally admitted by those familiar with the evidence on which they rest, that an elaborate discussion of this evidence is not required.\u201d - John D. Baldwin, Prehistoric Nations It\u2019s not just the linguistic and archeological research that have concluded the earliest inhabitants of Asia Minor were Ethiopians. The available genetic research from Sagalasos, a site in Pisidia, in Asia Minor reveals the same thing. \u201c\u2026 Keeping in mind these three elements, if we consider the affinity of the Sagalassos population with the sub-Saharan populations from Gabon and Somalia, a recent direct contact between these populations and regions probably can be excluded because they are separated by significant geographic distances. However, indirect contacts through geographically intermediary populations carrying \"sub-Saharan\" biological features in the late Pleistocene-Holocene period are discussion points..... From the Mesolithic to the early Neolithic period different lines of evidence support an out-of-Africa Mesolithic migration to the Levant by northeastern African groups that had biological affinities with sub-Saharan populations. From a genetic point of view, several recent genetic studies have shown that sub-Saharan genetic lineages (affiliated with the Y-chromosome PN2 Clade; Underhill et al. 2004) have spread through Egypt into the Near East, the Mediterranean area, and, for some lineages, as far north as Turkey(E3b-EM5 Lineage; Cinnioglu et al. 2004; Luis et al. 2004), probably during several dispersal episodes since the Mesolithic (Cinnioglu et al. 2004; King et al. 2008; Lucotte and Mercier 2003; Luis et al. 2004; Quintanna-Murci et al. 1999; Semino et al. 2004; Underhill et al. 2001). This finding is in agreement with morphological data that suggest that populations with sub-Saharan morphological elements were present in northeastern Africa, from the Paleolithic to at least the early Holocene, and diffused northward to the Levant and Anatolia beginning in the Mesolithic. Indeed, the rare and incomplete 33,000-year-old Nazlet Khater specimen (Pinhasi and Semal 2000), the Wadi Kubbaniya skeleton from the late Paleolithic site in the upper Nile Valley (Wendorf et al. 1986), the Qarunian (Faiyum) early Neolithic crania (Henneberg et al. 1989; Midant-Reynes 2000), and the Nabta specimen from the Neolithic Nabta Playa site in the western desert of Egypt (Henneberg et al. 1980)-show, with regard to the great African biological diversity, similarities with some of the sub-Saharan middle Paleolithic and modern sub-Saharan specimens. This affinity pattern between ancient Egyptians and sub-Saharans has also been noticed by several other investigators (Angel 1972; Berry and Berry 1967, 1972; Keita 1995) and has been recently reinforced by the study of Brace et al. (2005), which clearly shows that the cranial morphology of prehistoric and recent northeast African populations is linked to sub-Saharan populations (Niger-Congo populations). These results support the hypothesis that some of the Paleolithic-early Holocene populations from northeast Africa were probably descendents of sub-Saharan ancestral populations.\" - F. X. Ricaut, M. Waelkens, Cranial Discrete Traits in a Byzantine Population and Eastern Mediterranean Population Movements, Human Biology - Volume 80, Number 5, October 2008, pp. 535-564 The earliest inhabitants of Anatolia indeed possessed DNA that today clusters the strongest with people from Gabon in West-Central Africa and Somalia in East Africa today, and so do I. In this very same region of Anatolia with such a well documented \u201cSub-Saharan African\u201d genetic presence, the Phoenicians or Ideans from Crete were exhiled there and became known as the Solymi: \"The Lycians were from Crete in ancient times (for in the past none that lived on Crete were Greek). Now there was a dispute in Crete about the royal power between Sarpedon and Minos, sons of Europa; Minos prevailed in this dispute and drove out Sarpedon and his partisans; who, after being driven out, came to the Milyan land in Asia. What is now possessed by the Lycians was in the past Milyan, and the Milyans were then called Solymi. 1.173.3 For a while Sarpedon ruled them, and the people were called Termilae, which was the name that they had brought with them \u2026\u201d - Herodotus, The Histories  These banished Ideans or Solymi that came to be known as Lycians on the coast of Anatolia are the same Solymi that I have personally been accused of being too ignorant or scared to include in an account of the origins of the Jewish people for fear that I would find that they weren\u2019t Ethiopian. These sorts of insults and jabs are common. But what does the record actually say about the Solymi? \u201cAll this agrees with the theory that the Solymi were a semitic people, perhaps of that ancient type which is blended with Hamitic characters. The chief direct testimony to this effect is that of Choerilus of Samos, the contemporary of Herodotus, who wrote a poem on the Persian War, in which he mentions the Solymi as serving in the army of Xerxes, and says that their language was Phoenician. This statement is confirmed by their habit of shaving the head with the exception of a tuft \u2013 a custom ascribed by Herodotus to the Arabians, and mentioned in Scripture as practiced by the Edomites, Moabites and Ammonites\u2026\u201d (Philip Smith 1881, p. 433) By \u201cHamitic characters\u201d, the author means Negroid features. A semitic people with Negroid features, as were the Arabians, Edomites, Moabites and Ammonities the Solymi shared certain customs with. If you tell people that there are semitic people with Negroid features today, they\u2019ll cancel your t.v. show out of spite and ignorance. But it\u2019s the truth. The Shemitic people have always been Negroid. \u201cThe Children of Sam (Shem) settled in the center of the Earth, which is between Satidma and the sea and between Yemen and Syria. Allah made the prophets from them, revealed the Books to them, made them beautiful, gave them a black complexion, luminous and free of blemish\u2026The children of Ham settled in the south..Allah gave them a black complexion and gave some of them a black complexion, luminous and blemish-free\u2026The children of Japheth settled in Safoun toward the north\u2026They are light-skinned and very fair-skinned. - Al-Tabari, Ta\u2019rikh al-rusul wa\u2019l-muluk (\u201cThe History of the Messengers and Kings\u201d) Yet, the inhabitants of the Northern regions of the world documented to be sons of Japheth, even by themselves, are called sons of Shem or \u201cSemites\u201d because they invaded and migrated into the lands of Shem and speak \u201cSemitic\u201d languages. But the same courtesy is rarely admitted for the earliest Ethiopian inhabitants of the land of Shem who first spoke Shemitic languages such as the Solymi. The Solymi are suspected of having \u201cHamitic characters\u201d because they are recorded as Phoenicians speaking Ethiopians who served in Xerxes war against Greece: \u201cAll black Africans were known as Ethiopians to the ancient Greeks, as the fifth-century B.C. historian Herodotus tells us, and their iconography was narrowly defined by Greek artists in the Archaic (ca. 700\u2013480 B.C.) and Classical (ca. 480\u2013323 B.C.) periods, black skin color being the primary identifying physical characteristic. It is recorded that Ethiopians were among King Xerxes\u2019 troops when Persia invaded Greece in 480 B.C. Thus, the Greeks would have come into contact with large numbers of Africans at this time. Nonetheless, most ancient Greeks had only a vague understanding of African geography. They believed that the land of the Ethiopians was located south of Egypt. - Met Museum The recorded Ethiopian troops in question? 7.70.1 The Ethiopians above Egypt and the Arabians had Arsames for commander, while the Ethiopians of the east (for there were two kinds of them in the army) served with the Indians; they were not different in appearance from the others, only in speech and hair: the Ethiopians from the east are straight-haired, but the ones from Libya have the woolliest hair of all men. 7.70.2 These Ethiopians of Asia were for the most part armed like the Indians; but they wore on their heads the skins of horses' foreheads, stripped from the head with ears and mane; the mane served them for a crest, and they wore the horses' ears stiff and upright; for shields they had bucklers of the skin of cranes. - Herodotus These are the exact same characteristics the above mentioned Choerilus of Samos attributed to the Solymi: \u201cCherilus also, a still ancienter writer, and a poet, makes mention of our nation, and informs us that it came to the assistance of king Xerxes in his expedition against Greece; for, in his enumeration of all those nations, he last of all inserts ours among the rest, when he says:\u2014 \u201cAt the last there passed over a people, wonderful to be beheld; for they spake the Phoenician tongue with their mouths: they dwelt in the Solymean mountains, near a broad lake: their heads were sooty; they had round rasures on them; their heads and faces were like nasty horseheads also, that had been hardened in the smoke.\u201d I think, therefore, that it is evident to every body that Cherilus means us, because the Solymean mountains are in our country, wherein we inhabit; as is also the lake called Asphaltitis, for this is a broader and larger lake than any other that is in Syria.\u201d - Flavius Josephus, The Works of Flavius Josephus, the Learned and Authentic Jewish Historian, pg. 795, 1st century Jew, Soldier and Historian. It\u2019s all connected. There is a reason a 1st Century Jew felt comfortable claiming the place of a known group of Ethiopians, twice, because Josephus also claimed the \u201cHyksos\u201d or \u201cRoyal Shepherds\u201d, as the ancestors of the Israelite people, whom I will demonstrate were also recorded as Ethiopians shortly. The Romans didn\u2019t say the Jews were descended from the Ideans or the Solymi without a reason, the Greeks didn\u2019t say the Jews were descended from the Phoenicians and Arabians without a reason, and they all didn\u2019t report the Jews were descended from the Egyptians and Ethiopians without a reason. The Greeks and the Romans were not confused. They knew exactly who the Egyptians and Ethiopians were when they said the Jewish people were descendants of them. And if they were brought back from the dead today to be ridiculed and humiliated for saying what they said, they would not apologize. For what? Because people choose not to believe what they saw with their own eyes? Because another people claim to be Jewish today that simply don\u2019t fit any of the criteria of the Egyptians, Ethiopians or the Jews? \u201cIt is in fact manifest that the Colchians are Egyptian by race\u2026 several Egyptians told me that in their opinion the Colchians were descended from soldiers of Sesostris. I had conjectured as much myself from two pointers, firstly because they have black skins and kinky hair (to tell the truth this means nothing for other peoples have them too) and secondly and more reliably for the reason that alone among mankind the Egyptians and Ethiopians have practiced circumcision since time immemorial. The Phonecians and Syrians of Palestine themselves admit that they learnt the practice from the Egyptians while the Syrians in the river Thermodon and Pathenios region and their neighbors the Macrons say they learnt it recently from the Colchidians. These are the only races which practice circumcision and it is observable that they do it in the same way as the Egyptians. As between the Egyptians themselves and the Ethiopians I could not say which taught the other the practice, for among them it is clearly a custom of great antiquity.\u201d Herodotus, Book II, 104  Where were the ancient Persian practitioners of circumcision? Where were the ancient Turkish practitioners of circumcision? Where were the ancient Slavic practitioners of circumcision? Where were the ancient Polish practitioners of circumcision? Where are all the European groups touted today to be the founding stock of the people of Israel that received the covenant of circumcision from God Almighty? Nowhere to be found. But the Ethiopians and Egyptians the Jews were said to be descended from were around, and they practiced circumcision. Why is that? Herodotus documented this nearly one thousand years after the Israelites left Egypt under the tutelage of Moses. You\u2019d think within the span of those one thousand years of inhabiting Israel a group of Persians or Iranians would have been distinguished as the covenant people through the rite of circumcision passed down through their Caucasian-Iranian father Abraham, but that is not the case. The case is the ancestors of the Jews are reported as being Ethiopians that fled from their homeland - referencing Abraham\u2019s journey from Ur of the Chaldees in Mesopotamia into Canaan - then received the covenant of circumcision to be passed down forever through all males in the household of faith, then the household of faith migrated into Goshen in order to survive a famine in the land, a region within Egypt historically associated with Ethiopians called \u201cRoyal Shepherds\u201d or \u201cHyksos\u201d who migrated from Chaldea, where the children of Israel enjoyed a period of fame and prosperity among the Egyptians considering their brother Joseph was esteemed to be a prophet, a great ruler and even a god among the Egyptians for the great success and wealth he brought Egypt through the God of Israel. There the children of Israel multiplied, even when they fell out of favor with the Egyptians, and many still of the children of Israel made marriages with the Egyptians, just like Joseph, and produced children with them and passed down the customs and the rites they inherited from Abraham to them, such as circumcision. But it is considered of no importance that the oldest practitioners of circumcision were recorded as Ethiopians and Egyptians. Why is it that Egyptian and Ethiopian customs were so similar and the Egyptians were always described with Ethiopian features such as black skin and kinky hair? \u201cThey say also that the Egyptians are colonists sent out by the Ethiopians, Osiris having been the leader of the colony\u2026 And the larger part of the customs of the Egyptians are, they hold, Ethiopian, the colonists still preserving their ancient manners. For instance, the belief that their kings are gods, the very special attention which they pay to their burials, and many other matters of a similar nature are Ethiopian practices, while the shapes of their statues and the forms of their letters are Ethiopian; for of the two kinds of writing which the Egyptians have, that which is known as \"popular\" (demotic) is learned by everyone, while that which is called \"sacred\" is understood only by the priests of the Egyptians, who learn it from their fathers as one of the things which are not divulged, but among the Ethiopians everyone uses these forms of letters. Furthermore, the orders of the priests, they maintain, have much the same position among both peoples; for all are clean who are engaged in the service of the gods, keeping themselves shaven, like the Egyptian priests, and having the same dress and form of staff, which is shaped like a plough and is carried by their kings, who wear high felt hats which end in a knob at the top and are circled by the serpents which they call asps; and this symbol appears to carry the thought that it will be the lot of those who shall dare to attack the king to encounter death-carrying stings. Many other things are also told by them concerning their own antiquity and the colony which they sent out that became the Egyptians, but about this there is no special need of our writing anything.\u201d - Diodorus of Sicily, Book III The notion that the Egyptian people were descended from a colony of Ethiopians - from Mesopotamia - is fully supported by other writers as well as modern anthropological and genetic research. In fact, it is included in researchers most popular theories on the formation of the Dynastic Egyptian state. \u201cHence we may learn for certain, what was meant by the \u017facred language; and con\u017fequently, what was al\u017fo the \u017facred chara\u0107ter in Egypt: and be a\u017f\u017fured, that they were the ancient Ethiopic, or Chaldaic: for the original Ethiopia was no other than Chaldea. This writer adds, but \u017fome \u017fay, that they were Arabians. This is a title of the \u017fame purport; for the Arabians were originally Cuthites, or Ethiopians. Hence the province of Cu\u017fhan[Cushan] in Egypt, the \u017fame as the land of Go\u017fhen[Goshen], was called the Arabian nome; which was the be\u017ft of the land of Egypt. They were al\u017fo \u017ftyled Hellenes, Phoenices, Aurita: ; the la\u017ft of which titles is of great con\u017fequence in the hi\u017ftory and chronology of the country. The people \u017fo called were the fir\u017ft who reigned in Egypt; and with them the hi\u017ftory of that people mu\u017ft commence. Syncellus, who follows the ancient Chronicle, in \u017fpeaking of the dyna\u017fties in the Egyptian chronology, mentions the Aurita, as the fir\u017ft who reigned. \u201d\u2026 They were the \u017fame as the\u2026 Semidei, who are placed in the \u017fame rank. We are told by Manethon[Manetho], that the whole body of this people had the appellation of Royal Shepherds. But I \u017fhould imagine, that this title was more particularly given to their kings; who, by Africanus and others are \u017ftyled the * Hellenic and Royal Shepherds. It was a mark of di\u017ftinction, which they borrowed from their ance\u017ftors in Babylonia; among whom it \u017feems to have been common\u2026 At the time, when the Cuthite Ethiopians arrived, Lower Egypt was in great mea\u017fure a \u201cmora\u017fs : but under their dire\u0107tion it was drained by numerous canals; and rendered the mo\u017ft beautiful country in the world. They carried a \u017fluice with va\u017ft labour from the Pelu\u017fiac branch of the Nile to the we\u017ftern gulf of the Red Sea. Part of it remains at this day; and pa\u017f\u017fes through Grand Cairo towards Matarea, and is kept up with * great care. The chief of the pyramids at Cochome were erected by them. Herodotus mentions a tradition of their being built in the time of the Shepherd\u201d Philitis, when Egypt was under great calamities; when princes reigned, who\u017fe names were held by the people in abomination. The modern Arabs have accounts of their being built by \u201d I\u0101n Ebn I\u00e1n. By this is \u017fignified, that they were con\u017ftructed by the Ionim, the \u017fons of that I\u00f6n, called Ionas, and Ionichus, of Babylonia. Juba in his hi\u017ftory took notice, that the city Heliopolis was not the work of the native Egyptians, but of * Arabians; by which name the \u017fons of Chus are continually di\u017ftingui\u017fhed. They rai\u017fed the mo\u017ft ancient obeli\u017fks in Egypt; which were formed of one piece ; yet of an amazing \u017fize: and the granate, of which they con\u017fi\u017ft, is \u017fo hard, that \u017fcarcely any tool now-a-days can make an impre\u017f\u017fion. Hence it is matter of wonder, how they were originally framed, and engraved. They are full of hieroglyphics, curiou\u017fly wrought ; which, as we learn from Ca\u017f\u017fiodorus, were ancient * Chaldaic characters. The\u017fe were the \u017facred characters of Egypt, known only to the \u201cprie\u017fts; which had been introduced by the Cuthite Ethiopians\u2026 His rites were introduced into Egypt by the people abovementioned. But he was more commonly repre\u017fented under the chara\u0107ter of O\u017firis[Osiris] and Orus[Horus]. Stephanus, in like manner, \u017fpeaks of Mithras, as a man, and joins him with Phlegyas. He \u017fays, \u201cthat the\u017fe two were the authors of the Ethiopic rites and wor\u017fhip : for they were by birth Ethiopians : which people were the fir\u017ft nation con\u017ftituted in the world; and the fir\u017ft, which ena\u0111ed laws, and taught men to reverence the gods. All this is true of the Chaldaic Ethiopians. A large body of this people \u017fettled in Ethiopia above Egypt: and from their hi\u017ftory we may learn, how much the Egyptians were indebted to their ance\u017ftors. They in \u017fome degree looked upon the Egyptians as a \"colony from their family: and \u017fo far is true, that they were a draft from the great Amonian body, of which the Mizraim and the Cuthites were equally a part. Nothing can more \u017fatisfactorily prove, that the Cuthite Ethiopians had been in Egypt, and ruled there, than the laws of the \u201ccountry, which were plainly Ethiopic. And not only the laws, but, as we are a\u017f\u017fured by * Diodorus, the rites of \u017fepulture, and the honours paid to the ancient kings, their ance\u017ftors, were Ethiopic in\u017ftitutions. I have mentioned from Ca\u017f\u017fiodorus, that the \u017facred chara\u0107ters upon the obeli\u017fks were of Chaldaic original; which is the \u017fame as \u201cEthiopic. In confirmation of this, Diodorus tells us, that the\u017fe characters in Egypt were known only to a few, who were of the prie\u017fthood. But that in Ethiopia they were the national chara\u0107ter, and univer\u017fally \u201cunder\u017ftood. In \u017fhort, this writer a\u017f\u017fures us, that the rites in both nations had a great re\u017femblance, \u017fo as to be nearly the \u201c\u017fame. The prie\u017fts in each were reclu\u017fe, and given to celibacy\u2026\u201d - A New System, Or, An Analysis of Ancient Mythology: Wherein an Attempt is Made to Divest Tradition of Fable; and to Reduce the Truth to Its Original Purity ..., Jacob Bryant The Egyptian population having been in part descendants of Ethiopians from Mesopotamia on top of the natives of that land, the Egyptians too would have been a people characterized by brown and black skin like the Ethiopians, just as Herodotus reported: \u201c\u2026The men of Egypt are mostly brown or black with a skinny desiccated look.\u201d Ammianus Marcellinus, 4th Century CE, Book XXII, paragraph 16(23). Just like the Romans reported, almost eight hundred years after Herodotus gave the same report. Just as the Greeks reported. The Greek philosopher Aristotle spent twenty years studying with the Egyptians. One would think he knew exactly what he was talking about when he talked about the Egyptians: \"Too black a hue marks the coward, as witness Egyptians and Ethiopians, and so does also too white a complexion, as you may see from women. So the hue that makes for courage must be intermediate between these extremes. A tawny color indicates a bold spirit, as in lions; but too ruddy a hue marks a rogue, as in the case of the fox. ...\" - Aristotle, circa 300 BCE, Physiognomics.  Greek bronze of an Ethiopian, circa 320B.C.-30B.C., Egypt All arguments that the color black concerning the Egyptians referred to an \u201cOlive\u201d, or \u201cSwarthy\u201d complexion that secretly means \u201cwhite\u201d cease to hold any significance. The Ethiopians that Aristotle grouped the Egyptians in with had complexions that were literally black and brown. It was not allegory. It was not a figure of speech. It\u2019s not a conundrum. Aristotle could distinguish between different skin tones just fine, as he has awkwardly demonstrated. If the Egyptians and Ethiopians were too white or tawny or ruddy, he would have said so. But he didn\u2019t. His report is that they were too black. He also reaffirmed Herodotus\u2019 findings that the Egyptians possessed kinky hair and corroborates Ammianus Marcelinius\u2019 statements that they possesed a skinny, desicated look: \"Why are the Ethiopians and Egyptians bandy-legged? Is it because the bodies of living creatures become distorted by heat, like logs of wood when they become dry? The condition of their hair supports this theory; for it is curlier than that of other nations, and curliness as it were crookedness of hair.\" - Aristotle, Problemata 909, 7 The Ethiopians and the Egyptians are conjoined together. And these are who the Jewish people were most said to have been descended from, not because the Jewish people were secretly a people descended from Ham, though it is a certainty that the Jewish people married and produced children with many Hamitic peoples, but because there were Shemitic bloodlines among Hamitic peoples as has been recorded: \u201cJudea, \u017fays Alexander Polyhi\u017ftor, was \u017fo denominated from one Judah; who, together with Edom, was looked upon as of the ancient \u017ftock of the Semarim in Chaldea: for their ance\u017f\u017fors came from that country. But according to Iolaus the region had its name from judaeus, \u017ftyled Sparton ; \u017fo named, becau\u017fe his ance\u017f\u017fors were among tho\u017fe of the di\u017fper\u017fon in Babylonia. They were of the family of tho\u017fe who came\u2026 out of the Ark with Dionu\u017fus; and who were confederate with the \u017fons of Chus in \u017fome of their fir\u017ft enterpri\u017fes.\u201d - - A New System, Or, An Analysis of Ancient Mythology: Wherein an Attempt is Made to Divest Tradition of Fable; and to Reduce the Truth to Its Original Purity ..., Jacob Bryant  Three Chaldean soldiers with Hebrew captives, Bristol Psalter, 11th century Greek painter The sons of Shem lived together with the sons of Ham, in Arabia, in Mesopotamia, in Assyria and parts of Africa. Of course they were confederate with the sons of Cush when they began to change the face of the world and develop laws and nations and the worship of men and idols. Or was Terah, Abraham\u2019s father, not an idol worshiper in Ur of the Chaldeans, the city established by colonizing Ethiopians?  The Sacrifice of Isaac, Portrait of Abraham and Isaac, Via Latina Catacombs, Rome, C. 320 AD \u201c\u2026The oldest Chaldean cities were in the neighborhood of the Persian Gulf. Ur, or Hur, represented as the first city built by the colonizing Cushites, was situated at the mouth of the Euphrates, with the open sea before it. Its ruins are now at a long distance from both. All the best qualified investigators agree that the evidence already obtained shows conclusively the Cushite or Ethiopian origin of Chaldea. A note which Sir Henry Rawlinson appends to his \"essay on the Early History of Babylonia\" speaks on this point as follows: \"All the traditions of Babylonia and Assyria point to a connection, in very early times, between Ethiopia, Southern Arabia, and the cities on the Lower Euphrates. In the geographical lists, the names of Mirukh (Ethiopia) and Makkan are thus always conjoined with those of Hur and Akkad. The building of Hur, again, is the earliest historical event of which the Babylonians seem to have had any cognizance ; but the inscriptions constantly refer to a tradition of the primeval leader by whom the Cushites were first settled on the Euphrates, and one of the names of this leader is connected with Ethiopia in a way that can hardly be accidental.\" \u2026If every competent investigator would allow himself to see and comprehend the country which the ancients designated as Ethiopia and the Land of Cush, there would be no failure to recognise Arabia as the mother country of Chaldea; and there would be a more intelligent appreciation of the large amount of ancient tradition which brings the Cushites into that part of Asia, and sometimes describes it as a part of Ethiopia. It was Ethiopian in race, language, and civilization, and constituted a portion of the wide-spread territory occupied by the Cushites, \"from the extremity of the east to the extremity of the west.\" - John D. Baldwin, Prehistoric Nations This goes back to what I spoke of earlier concerning Shemites of Negroid descent. Christians, Muslims, Talmudist, anthropologist and geneticist can all agree that Arabia was the original home of Shemitic peoples, but history and anthropology only remembers the original inhabitants of Arabia as Ethiopians. \u201cIn reality, neither history nor tradition has knowledge of more than two races in Arabia-the very ancient Cushites, who were a great and enterprising people in remote prehistoric times, and the Arabian Semites, who were not there during the grand periods of Arabian ancient history, and did not appear there until many centuries after the extended empire of the Cushites, or Ethiopians, had declined and become disunited. These Arabic Semites, who have chiefly occupied attention, and whose history has been allowed to obscure the ancient and true Arabians, were an unimportant, and probably a nomadic people, when they first appeared in the country, and they remained very obscure until the beginning of the seventh century after the Christian Era. They are generally called Moustarribes by their own writers, while those of the ancient race are called Aribah, or Arabians of the oldest and selectest blood.\u201d - John D. Baldwin, Prehistoric Nations It has caused a great deal of un-needed confusion to call people who barely came to prominence in Arabia in the 7th Century CE Semitic, and so claim the actual Shemites of Arabia who existed before them were nothing but landless, unimportant nomads for over 2,700 years. Did the sons of Shem build a time machine so they could miraculously show up in the 7th Century CE just in time to get corralled by Muhammad into slaughtering the original inhabitants of the land in the name of Islam and taking everything they had for themselves down to their history and their name? Who were the Elamites? Who were the Ashurites? Who built Ninevah, and Resen, and Reheboth, and Calah? And the Midianites? And the Ammonites? And the Moabites? And the Ishmaelites? And the Kedarites? And the Edomites? And the Israelites? Those were the Arabian Shemitic people. They were said to be descended from Arabians and you saw it with your own eyes. These people were not unimportant, they were not nomads, and they did not wait until the 7th Century CE to show up. But what? Because history only remembers the Arabian Shemites before the 7th Century as Ethiopians they can no longer be descendants of Shem? For what arbitrary cause? If you search for the identity of these Semitic peoples you will find that they are record as Negroid peoples: \u201cMidian (/\u02c8m\u026adi\u0259n/; Hebrew: \u05de\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05df Mi\u1e0fy\u0101n [mid.ja\u02d0n]; Arabic: \u0645\u064e\u062f\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0646\u200e, romanized: Madyan; Greek: \u039c\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bc, Madiam)[a] is a geographical place mentioned in the Torah and Quran. William G. Dever states that biblical Midian was in the \"northwest Arabian Peninsula, on the east shore of the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea\", an area which he notes was \"never extensively settled until the 8th\u20137th century B.C.\"[1] According to the Book of Genesis, the Midianites were the descendants of Midian, who was a son of Abraham and his wife Keturah: \"Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah\" (Genesis 25:1\u20132, King James Version).[2]\u201d -Wikipedia The Midianites were the children of Abraham right? They were Semites right? Then by today\u2019s standards, history should\u2019ve recorded the Midianites as a fair-skinned people with roots in Persia or the Caucasus mountains, because, obviously, Negroes cannot be Semitic peoples and we have no idea what we\u2019re talking about. So who does history remember the people of Midian or Madyan being, a Negroid people or an Ashkenazi people? \u201cThis coast immediately beyond the boundaries of Palestine is held by Saracens, who have been settled from of old in the Palm Groves. These groves are in the interior, extending over a great tract of land, and there absolutely nothing else grows except palm trees. The Emperor Justinian had received these palm groves as a present from Abochorabus, the ruler of the Saracens there, and he was appointed by the emperor captain over the Saracens in Palestine. And he guarded the land from plunder constantly, for both to the barbarians over whom he ruled and no less to the enemy, Abochorabus always seemed a man to be feared and an exceptionally energetic fellow. Formally, therefore, the emperor holds the Palm Groves, but for him really to possess himself of any of the country there is utterly impossible. For a land completely destitute of human habitation and extremely dry lies between, extending to the distance of a ten days' journey; moreover, the Palm Groves themselves are by no means worth anything, and Abochorabus only gave the form of a gift, and the emperor accepted it with full knowledge of the fact. So much then for the Palm Groves. Adjoining this people there are other Saracens in possession of the coast, who are called Maddeni [in modern Madyan] and who are subjects of the Omeritae. These Omeritae dwell in the land on the farther side of them on the shore of the sea [modern Yemen]. And beyond them many other nations are said to be settled as far as the man-eating Saracens. Beyond these are the nations of India.\u201d - Procopius of Caesarea, History of the Wars, c. 550 CE, Book I.xix.1-16, 23-26; xx.1-13: You will find upon closer inspection, that the term Saracen in 550 CE had the exclusive meaning and connotation of a Black race of people: \"The giantess, blackness, and bestiality are typical medieval attributes of the Saracens. 'Saracens are often portrayed in the epics and in later romances', we are told by Lasater, \u2018as tall, hideous, huge, often misshapen, frequently as black moors or Negroes, and usually with eyes as red as glowing coals associated with ferocity\u2019\" (Nizar F.

Why were the Saracens portrayed as Negroes? Why were they portrayed as a race of vicious, ferocious animals? \u201cAt this time also the Saracens, a race whom it is never desirable to have either for friends or enemies, ranging up and down the country, if ever they found anything, plundered it in a moment, like rapacious hawks who, if from on high they behold any prey, carry it off with a rapid swoop, or, if they fail in their attempt, do not tarry. And although, in recounting the career of the Prince Marcus, and once or twice subsequently, I remember having discussed the manners of this people, nevertheless I will now briefly enumerate a few more particulars concerning them. Among these tribes, whose primary origin is derived from the cataracts of the Nile and the borders of the Blemmyae, all the men are warriors of equal rank; half naked, clad in colored cloaks down to the waist, overrunning different countries, with the aid of swift and active horses and speedy camels, alike in times of peace and war. Nor does any member of their tribe ever take plow in hand or cultivate a tree, or seek food by the tillage of the land; but they are perpetually wandering over various and extensive districts, having no home, no fixed abode or laws; nor can they endure to remain long in the same climate, no one district or country pleasing them for a continuance.\u201d - Ammianus Marcellinus: The Roman History, Book XIV.iv.4, c. 380 CE The Saracens were thought to be derived from the cataracts of the Nile and the borders of the Blemmyae. Where is that?  Location of the territories of the Blemmyeas. This is of course the same Nile Diodorus of Sicily described full of Ethiopians with black skin, flat noses and wooly hair in the 1st Century BC that has provided the framework for how anthropologist determine who is and isn\u2019t a Negro. \u201cBut there are also a great many other tribes of the Ethiopians, some of them dwelling in the land lying on both banks of the Nile and on the islands in the river, others inhabiting the neighbouring country of Arabia, and still others residing in the interior of Libya. The majority of them, and especially those who dwell along the river, are black in colour and have flat noses and woolly hair.\u201d - Diodorus of Sicily, Book III, Chapter VIII These are the very same locations Flavius Josephus, \u201cthe authentic and learned Jewish historian\u201d maintained Abraham settled Midian and his other sons and daughters by Keturah: \u201cFlavius Josephus alludes to a place he calls Troglodytis while discussing the account in Genesis, that after the death of Sarah, Abraham married Keturah and fathered six sons who in turn fathered many more. \"Now, for all these sons and grandsons, Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies; and they took possession of Troglodytis, and the country of Arabia Felix...\"[12] The Troglodytis Josephus refers to here is generally taken to mean both coasts of the Red Sea.[13] However, Josephus goes on to state that the descendants of one of these grandsons, Epher, invaded Libya, and that the name of Africa was thus derived from that of Epher.[12] The dominant modern hypothesis is that Africa stems from the Berber word ifri (plural ifran), meaning \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.[14]\u201d - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  It should come as no surprise then why European Crusaders recorded the Saracens as a race of savage Arabian Bedoins that were blacker than soot and fearless in combat: \u201cIt was now nearly nine o'clock, when there appeared a large body of the Turks, 10,000 strong, coming down upon us at full charge, and throwing darts and arrows, as fast as they could, while they mingled their voices in one horrible yell. There followed after them an infernal race of men, of black colour, and bearing a suitable appellation, expressive of their blackness. With them also were the Saracens, who live in the desert, called Bedouins: they are a savage race of men, blacker than soot; they fight on foot, and carry a bow, quiver, and round shield, and are a light and active race. These men dauntlessly attacked our army.\u201d From the Itinerarium Peregrinorum et Gesta Regis Ricardi) (a Latin narrative of the historical events in Palestine during the Third Crusade,1189-1192) Who are the most famous Arabian Semites in the world? The children of Abraham. Who were some of the children of Abraham? The Israelites and the Midianites. How did history record them? Well, the children of Israel were recorded as Egyptians and Ethiopians but the Midianites were recorded as Saracens. What is the most common denominator between all three groups? They\u2019re all referred to as Negroid peoples today. But there is no such thing as a Negroid Semite according to the world, even though that\u2019s twice now the children of Abraham have been recorded as Negroes. That number could easily be pushed to four with the available records on the Kedarites and Ishmaelites. I don\u2019t believe historical records will be enough to fully convince people of the Egypto-Ethiopian nature of the Jewish people, especially if minds have already been made up before reading a single word, but the historical record has to be made clear so people understand we\u2019re not the ones coming out of left field for claiming what we claim about our identity and heritage. Our story is vouched for in the actual history recorded in this world. The same can\u2019t be said for other people who claim to be Jews. They don\u2019t even acknowledge the vast historical record or waste time trying to make themselves fit the mold history has cast for the Jews. They just ignore it and claim Jewish ancestry anyway, and people roll with it without asking any questions because people care more about fitting in than being right. But for the people who actually care to understand what is true and what is right, you deserve to have access to it if you want it. The Twelve Tribes of Israel, deserve to understand their heritage, their culture, their past, their present and their future, if they want it, if they want to be a people again, if they want to be whole again. It is not just, it is not right, it is not fair, it is not cool to deny an entire broken people their history so another people can feel comfortable stealing it. If that\u2019s how you want to be remembered in history, let it be so, but somebody has to tell the truth and stand up for this people. The Jews themselves said they were descended from Syrians: Deuteronomy 26 King James Version (KJV) 26 And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein; 2 That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his name there. 3 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come unto the country which the Lord sware unto our fathers for to give us. 4 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the Lord thy God. 5 And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous: 6 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage: 7 And when we cried unto the Lord God of our fathers, the Lord heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression: 8 And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders: 9 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey. If you had exactly one chance, to make one wild guess as to who you think the historical record actually says the Syrian people were two thousands years ago, and the penalty for being wrong was losing your life, who would you say were the Syrian people were: \u201cThe boundary of the Paphlagonians to the east is the river Halys, which \ufb02ows from the south between the Syrians and the Paphlagonians; and according to Herodotus,\u2019 (who means Cappadocians, when he is speaking of Syrians,) discharges itself into the Euxine Sea. Even at present they are called Leuco-Syrians, (or White Syrians,) while those without the Taurus are called Syrians. In comparison with the people within the Taurus, the latter have a burnt complexion; but the former, not having it, received the appellation of Leuco Syrians (or White Syrians).\u201d - Strabo, Geography  \u201cAccording to Hesychius, the Island of Lesbos was anciently called Ethiopia, and its people Ethiopes; having been colonized from the Syrian coast. The Leuco-Syri, or White Syrians seem to have received the name as a distinctive term by which any confusion between them and their darker neighbours to the South might be avoided.\u201d Encyclopedia Metropolitana; or, Universal Dictionary of Knowledge, 1845, p.642 The Syrians below or without the Taurus Mountains were Mesopotamians, of course they had a black complexion, of course they were recorded as Ethiopians. \u201cJacob was a Syrian, partly, by his original, as being born of Syrian parents, as were Abraham and Rebekah, both of Chaldea or Mesopotamia, which was a part of Syria largely so called, as is confessed by Strabo, b. 16. and by Pliny, b. 5. c. 12; partly, by his education and conversation, for which reason Christ is called a Nazarene, and a Capernaite; and partly, by his relations, his wives being such, and his children too by their mothers. Ready to perish; either through want and poverty; see Genesis 28:11,20 32:10; or through the rage of his brother Esau, and the treachery and cruelty of his father-in-law Laban.\u201d - Mathew Poole\u2019s Commentary, Deuteronomy 26:5 Or was the Syrian king Konon of Dura-Europos and all his family and all the Syrian priest of Ba\u2019al around the time Jesus Christ walked the earth not depicted with every bit of the burnt complexion history records the Syrians having?  The Sacrifice of Konon, Dura-Europos, Syria, 100 B.C -100 A.D., Unmistakably Black: Sculpture and Paintings from Ancient Syria and Anatolia, by Anu M\u2019Bantu Or has it not been said enough that the inhabitants of Chaldea were Ethiopians? \u201cHence we may learn for certain, what was meant by the \u017facred language; and con\u017fequently, what was al\u017fo the \u017facred chara\u0107ter in Egypt: and be a\u017f\u017fured, that they were the ancient Ethiopic, or Chaldaic: for the original Ethiopia was no other than Chaldea. This writer adds, but \u017fome \u017fay, that they were Arabians. This is a title of the \u017fame purport; for the Arabians were originally Cuthites, or Ethiopians. Hence the province of Cu\u017fhan[Cushan] in Egypt, the \u017fame as the land of Go\u017fhen[Goshen], was called the Arabian nome; which was the be\u017ft of the land of Egypt. They were al\u017fo \u017ftyled Hellenes, Phoenices, Aurita: ; the la\u017ft of which titles is of great con\u017fequence in the hi\u017ftory and chronology of the country. The people \u017fo called were the fir\u017ft who reigned in Egypt; and with them the hi\u017ftory of that people mu\u017ft commence. Syncellus, who follows the ancient Chronicle, in \u017fpeaking of the dyna\u017fties in the Egyptian chronology, mentions the Aurita, as the fir\u017ft who reigned. \u201d\u2026 They were the \u017fame as the\u2026 Semidei, who are placed in the \u017fame rank\u2026 His rites were introduced into Egypt by the people abovementioned. But he was more commonly repre\u017fented under the chara\u0107ter of O\u017firis[Osiris] and Orus[Horus]. Stephanus, in like manner, \u017fpeaks of Mithras, as a man, and joins him with Phlegyas. He \u017fays, \u201cthat the\u017fe two were the authors of the Ethiopic rites and wor\u017fhip : for they were by birth Ethiopians : which people were the fir\u017ft nation con\u017ftituted in the world; and the fir\u017ft, which ena\u0111ed laws, and taught men to reverence the gods. All this is true of the Chaldaic Ethiopians. A large body of this people \u017fettled in Ethiopia above Egypt: and from their hi\u017ftory we may learn, how much the Egyptians were indebted to their ance\u017ftors. They in \u017fome degree looked upon the Egyptians as a \"colony from their family: and \u017fo far is true, that they were a draft from the great Amonian body, of which the Mizraim and the Cuthites were equally a part. Nothing can more \u017fatisfactorily prove, that the Cuthite Ethiopians had been in Egypt, and ruled there, than the laws of the \u201ccountry, which were plainly Ethiopic. - A New System, Or, An Analysis of Ancient Mythology: Wherein an Attempt is Made to Divest Tradition of Fable; and to Reduce the Truth to Its Original Purity ..., Jacob Bryant The Israelites were not the only Syrians who migrated to Egypt and became a part of the general population: \u201cThere are some who say that a motley collection of landless Assyrians occupied a part of Egypt, and then built cities of their own, inhabiting the lands of the Hebrews and the nearer parts of Syria.\u201d - Tacitus, The Histories, Book V, 110C.E. The Assyrians became a fundamental part of Egypt, even down to the Pharaoh of the Exodus: Isaiah 52:4-6 King James Version 4 For thus saith the Lord God, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 5 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the Lord, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the Lord; and my name continually every day is blasphemed. 6 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I. Therefore it should come as no surprise that Strabo reported the most accredited of the accounts of the origins of the Jewish race, were the Egyptians, alongside the Arabians and Phoenicians, or that Tacitus reported the Jews were the surplus population of Egypt, and Ethiopians and Ideans and Solymi, or that the Israelite people were reliably mistaken to be Egyptians throughout the Hebrew Scriptures and Writings: Exodus 2:11-19 King James Version (KJV) 11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? 19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. Moses appeared for all intents and purposes to be an Egyptian, someone with black skin and kinky hair according to Herodotus, and he made his home the land of the Midianites, the wild, black, Ethiopian, Negro, Saracen Arabs, for many, many years, and he took one of the daughters of Reuel or Jethro for a wife and produced children with her. Then of course some one thousand and five-hundred years later, the Apostle Paul was mistaken by a Roman centurion to be an Egyptian Josephus recorded stood on the Mount of Olives and claimed to be Jesus Christ, then led thousands of Israelites to their deaths and imprisonment trying to take back Jerusalem from the Romans by military force: Acts 21:37-39 King James Version (KJV) 37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? 38 Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers? 39 But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people. This is of course between the time the Greeks described the Egyptians with black skin and kinky hair in the 5th Century BC, and the Romans described the Egyptians as being mostly black or brown skinned with a desiccated look in the 4th Century CE, corroborating Aristotle\u2019s remarks on the skinny look and crooked hair of the Egyptians and Ethiopians in the 4th Century BC. In the context of everything that has been said on the Egypto-Ethiopian origins of the Jews, this is the standard of comparison for who the Jewish people should have affinities with and beside it there can be none else. Because the evidence of the Egypto-Ethiopian nature of the Jews does not stop at ancient history. It doesn\u2019t. It goes into the field of anthropology, it goes into the field of genetics, it spills over all the way into modern history, and it does so because it is the truth. Anthropological References on the Jewish People There is a code in Jewish law that states the legitimacy of a matter ought to be established and investigated at the mouth of two or three witnesses. The collective number of witnesses to the Ethiopian nature of the Jewish people and the Negroid nature of the Ethiopians far exceeds that number. This should call for people to reevaluate their position on who can and can\u2019t be a bloodline descendant of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, or at the very least approach the subject with an open mind. Nothing so succinctly drives this point home than the report given by Gaius Tacitus: \u201cMany assure us that the Jews are descended from those Ethiopians who were driven by fear and hatred to emigrate from their home country when Cepheus was king.\u201d - Gaius Cornelius Tacitus, Roman Senator and Historian, The Histories, Book V, 110C.E. If many assured the Romans that the Jews were descended from Ethiopians or Cushites, when you dig up their bones in their land, you should find Ethiopians or Cushites. If many assured the Romans the Jews were descended from the Ashkenazi, when you dig up their bones, you should find the Ashkenazi. Is this not beyond fair? Is this not a reasonable measure of truth? Because frankly, people will sit right in front of all the historical evidence and play stupid like every single one of those historical sources was lying or misinformed. Like that\u2019s just the kind of world we live in, where dozens of experts on a subject matter with nothing to gain or lose come together to report the same thing, but all of a sudden none of what they say is grounded in reality because people don\u2019t want to believe it. O.k. If the land of Israel gives up skulls and bones that can be proven to have belonged to the Jewish people that confirms or denies the vast historical record, that should decide whether or not all of histories cherished classical authors are incompetent liars or whether the people who criticize and disparage us are incompetent liars. The cities of ancient Israelites have in fact been excavated and their remains have been studied to determine their racial make up. The ancient city of Lachich is one of those locations. In its prime it was bigger than Biblical Jerusalem, and it was the second most important city of the Jews next to it, and therefore the target of the Assyrian king Sennacherib when he invaded Judea as scripture records: 2 Chronicles 32:9 King James Version (KJV) 9 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying, It was a massacre, because it was God who caused the Assyrians to rise up against the people of Samaria and Judah for all of their sins and crimes against him: Isaiah 10:5-13 King James Version (KJV) 5 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation. 6 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. 7 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few. 8 For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings? 9 Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus? 10 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; 11 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? 12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks. 13 For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man: But who were the people that Sennacherib put down in Lachich? Did he put down an Egypto-Ethiopian people or did he put down an Ashkenazi-Iranian people? Who did the excavators really unearth? What did the anthropologist really discover when they analyzed the structure of the Lachich skulls? \"The excavation uncovered a mass of human bones, which was estimated to form the remains of fifteen hundred individuals [...] Remains of 695 skulls were brought to London by the British expedition [...] Curiously, the crania indicate a close resemblance to the population of Egypt at this time [...] 'the relationships found suggests that the population of the town in 700 B.C. was entirely, or almost entirely, of Egyptian origin...' They show further, that the population of Lakish was probably derived from Upper Egypt [...] If so, this indeed is a conclusion of far-reaching implications.\" David Ussiskhin's \"The Conquest of Lachish by Sennacherib\"; Tel Aviv University, The Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv, 1982: p.56-57 So short-sighted, so arrogant, so malicious are the accusations levied against us. How far do you think the implications reach? \u201cBut though the inhabitants are mixed up thus, the most prevalent of the accredited reports in regard to the temple at Jerusalem represents the ancestors of the present Judaeans, as they are called, as Aegyptians.\u201d - Strabo, The Geography of Strabo, Volume 3, pg. 177 Where is the inconsistency in the record? The entire population of one of the most important cities of the Jews in 700 BC appeared for all intents and purposes to be comprised of Upper Egyptians. Overtly Negroid Egyptians. Over seven hundred years later in the 1st Century CE the Greek geographer Strabo gave the same account of the Jewish people the anthropological evidence yields for the Jewish people; that they were Egyptians, though we know a sizable portion of the Egyptian population were descended from Ethiopians from Mesopotamia, whom the Jews were also said to be the descendants of in the 1st Century CE by the Roman historian Tacitus, as Abraham migrated from that country, which is recorded in history as the original Ethiopia. This is why the inhabitants of Lachich were specifically referred to as Kushites by other anthropologist, which again is synonymous with Ethiopian: \u201cThe first expedition to Lachich, the Wellcome-Marston Archeological Expedition to the Near East, directed by James Leslie Starkey, excavated four interconnecting cave-tombs (Tomb 107, 108, 116, and 120) near the foot of the tell. The tombs were veritable charnel houses, once filled with bodies, which on excavation were found to be reduced to a ca. 1 m-high bone pile. Starkey described the opening of the largest tomb, Tomb 120 as \u201c[a] mass of human bones, the remains of at least 1500 bodies. As they were pitched through the hole in the broken roof, the skulls rolled down from the apex of the pile to the sides of the chamber\u2026\u201d (Starkey 1936: 169). Pottery from the cave tombs provided a rough date, and Starkey concluded that the caves contained the remains of those Lachishites killed during the siege or executed later by the Assyrians. The crania were examined in London, but not for the cause of death. Only one skull displayed a wound that could have led to the individual\u2019s death, while injuries that may have left a mark elsewhere on the skeletal material could not be determined, as the other bones were not studied. However, the surprising result of the cranial analysis most pertinent to this study is that the closest match for the skeletons was Kerma in Upper Egypt, the Kushite homeland (Risdon 1939: 110). There were more males than females in the selection studied and a number of (unsexed) immature skulls. Interestingly, the average age of death was lower than any other cemetery group studied, and elderly specimens were absent (Risdon 1939: 106, 109). These remains appear to belong to a Kushite population in their prime, with a higher proportion of males to females, but possibly composed of family units. If so, they must have arrived relatively recently as no one had time to grow old. Were these Kushites resident in Lachich? Possibly, these were contingents of warriors and equestrians, living in family groups in Lachich, just as Kushites had once lived in Samaria (see Anderson 1996: 64\u201368). One thing is certain: they died together in the carnage surrounding the fall of Lachich.\u201d - The Kushite Connection, THE KUSHITE CONNECTION: THE DESTRUCTION OF LACHISH AND THE SALVATION OF JERUSALEM The objective evidence has concluded that the people slain in Lachich were slain by the Assyrians during the siege of Lachich. My question to every person who subscribes to a belief in any \u201cso called\u201d Abrahamic religion, whether Christianity, Islam or Judaism, is who did the Most High send the Assyrians to slay? Isaiah 10:6,12 King James Version (KJV) 6 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. 12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks. If you think the God of Israel didn\u2019t hit who he wanted to hit you either don\u2019t know the God of Israel or you don\u2019t believe in the God of Israel. He hit Zion. He hit the people of Israel and Judah. The same people of Israel and Judah recorded in history by classical authors as Egypto-Cushites. Does it surprise you that Egypto-Cushites were unearthed in the cities of Israel and Judah? The Israelites have always been a Negroid people. But I\u2019m supposed to feel guilty and ashamed for saying that the the Ashkenazi people have stolen and appropriated my people\u2019s heritage and culture? No dice. I must say what is right. But of course, the issue will never be put to rest on account of Hebrew Israelites actually being right, because the world we finds ourselves in hates and despises Negroes, and this hatred has spilled over so violently over the past few centuries I need not discuss it. Realistically speaking, most of the world will never willingly admit that the Jewish people were and are Negroes because most of the world simply does not want the Jewish people to be Negroes. Objective evidence doesn\u2019t mean anything. People say it does to hide their hatred under a veneer of professionalism, but once the objective evidence is brought to light the facade evaporates. All that\u2019s left is a gang of racist, hot-tempered, foul-mouthed liars and slanderers with chips on every single one of their shoulders. Ignoring the historical record, ignoring the anthropological evidence that supports it, they look at me with cold, beady eyes and say there\u2019s no way the Ethiopians unearthed in Lachich were the Jewish people. Well, that\u2019s not the version of reality the Assyrians were acquainted with. They left behind reliefs depicting the Jews they slaughtered and enslaved as the same Ethiopians that were unearthed thousands of years later:     The Jewish people can of course be identified by the fringes they wore at the bottom of their garments, and may readily be compared to depictions of other peoples freely admitted to be Ethiopians from antiquity.       But as a grand distraction, knocking over the glass water pitcher in the court of law before making a break for it, they then label me a racist for providing proof of what I claim. This in no way equates to me having hateful or racist thoughts for the Ashkenazi, or promoting hatred against them, it\u2019s just the truth that they don\u2019t fit the criteria of the Jewish people. Literally. Their skulls do not match the profile of the Lachich type and scholars have known this for almost one hundred years: \u201c\u2026All that can be said is that the average cephalic index for both series of unsexed skulls is about 76. The Lachich male mean is 74*3, and the female is 75*5. There appear to be no published records for any other long series of skulls of any date from Palestine, or any neighboring country except Egypt. Measurements of small numbers of ancient Jewish and Phonecian and modern Arab specimens have been given, but these are practically worthless for statistical purposes. There are no adequate data for ancient Jewish skulls from any locality. The longest modern series representing this people is one published by Prof. J. Matiegka (1926) of seventeenth-century Jews buried in Prague. The average cephalic index for the fifty-three male skulls is 82*0, which is sufficient to show that there can be no close connexion with the Lachish people (74*3), or with any of the Ancient Egyptian groups, for which the highest index is 76*0.\u201d Biometrika, Volume 31, Issue 1-2, 1 July 1939, Pages 158\u2013159, On contraire, the cephalic indices of the Jews of Africa are adequate matches for the Lachich skulls and scholars have admitted it. But Negroid affinities of the Lachich people run much more deeper than that. African-Americans represent the closest matches for the Jews of Lachich in terms of body proportions to date: \u201cA tropical people, African-American limb proportions have long been used as a proxy to study height and stature of ancient Egyptian populations, who cluster closer to the Americans than Europeans and other groups. Extended to Nubians in a recent study, results are the same. Though distant in time and space, the Black Americans, ancient Egyptians and ancient Nubians cluster together- indices with some differences- overall, the closest fit.\u201d \"Stature is a component of the biological profile along with age, sex, and ancestry. In bioarchaeological contexts, changes in stature or body proportions over time can indicate trends in the health of a population. However, stature regression equations are likely to be inaccurate when applied to populations temporally and geographically distant from their reference sample. This study tested the accuracy of previously published regression equations on a well-preserved medieval Nubian collection and hypothesized that stature would be significantly overestimated. The study sample was drawn from a skeletal collection representing three Upper Nubian medieval cemeteries (300-1500AD) excavated by the British Museum along the Fourth Cataract in Sudan - sites 3-J-10, 3-J-11, and 4-M-142. Based on preservation of required skeletal elements, living stature was calculated for 36 males and 33 females using the revised Fully method (Raxter et al. 2006). These data were compared to point estimates from regression equations for modern American blacks (Trotter and Gleser 1952) and ancient Egyptians (Raxter et al. 2008). Although distant in both time and space, these groups represented the closest proxies for Nubians among previously published studies.. Results indicated significant differences between both sets of estimates and the Fully revised method living statures (p<0.001). Both Trotter and Gleser (1952) and Raxter (2008) equations overestimated living stature in this sample of medieval Nubians. These results confirmed the need for new stature regression equations for males and females in this region and time period. Equations were then developed using single and multiple long bone measurements.. The results of the one-way t-test confirm the hypothesis: American black and Ancient Egyptian stature regression equations systematically overestimate height in medieval Nubians by an average of 1.72-2.16cm. However, the results of the ANOVA suggest that the resulting point stature estimates are not significantly different from the revised Fully statures.\"--Niespodziewanski Streetman, Emily (2014).

It is situated extremely close to the 3rd Cataract of the Nile River, a very short ways away from the 4th Cataract of the Nile River where the samples in this study were taken from that define Egyptians and Ethiopians as close anthropological matches, confirming once again what the historical record has reported about them both, and the Jewish people, and that African-Americans are in fact matches for the Jews of Lachich on an anthropological level.

Bard and Steven Blake Shubert, ( London and New York: Routledge, 1999) pp 328-332) This sufficient body of evidence draws from multiple studies and anthropologist and concludes the very same thing that historians ancient and modern have concluded; the formation of the Dynastic Egyptian state was sparked by the invasion of a strong Ethiopian type from the South that conquered and mixed with the pre-existing population in the North, to wit: \u201cFor Hansberry, the research showed \u201cthat there was a large black or Negroid element in North Africa in the proto dynastic period of Egypt.\u201d The implications of this conclusion are fairly clear. Here lay Egypt\u2019s African roots exposed; and those roots indicated that Minoan culture knew the \u201cEthiopian type from the beginning of the Minoan age,\u201d and for a period of time considerably longer than the critics of the classics or those who argued against an African presence in the classical world were willing to concede.\u201d - Maghan Keita, Race and the Writing of History: Riddling the Sphinx \u201cHis rites were introduced into Egypt by the people abovementioned. But he was more commonly repre\u017fented under the chara\u0107ter of O\u017firis[Osiris] and Orus[Horus]. Stephanus, in like manner, \u017fpeaks of Mithras, as a man, and joins him with Phlegyas. He \u017fays, \u201cthat the\u017fe two were the authors of the Ethiopic rites and wor\u017fhip : for they were by birth Ethiopians : which people were the fir\u017ft nation con\u017ftituted in the world; and the fir\u017ft, which ena\u0111ed laws, and taught men to reverence the gods. All this is true of the Chaldaic Ethiopians. A large body of this people \u017fettled in Ethiopia above Egypt: and from their hi\u017ftory we may learn, how much the Egyptians were indebted to their ance\u017ftors. They in \u017fome degree looked upon the Egyptians as a \"colony from their family: and \u017fo far is true, that they were a draft from the great Amonian body, of which the Mizraim and the Cuthites were equally a part. Nothing can more \u017fatisfactorily prove, that the Cuthite Ethiopians had been in Egypt, and ruled there, than the laws of the \u201ccountry, which were plainly Ethiopic. And not only the laws, but, as we are a\u017f\u017fured by * Diodorus, the rites of \u017fepulture, and the honours paid to the ancient kings, their ance\u017ftors, were Ethiopic in\u017ftitutions. I have mentioned from Ca\u017f\u017fiodorus, that the \u017facred chara\u0107ters upon the obeli\u017fks were of Chaldaic original; which is the \u017fame as \u201cEthiopic. In confirmation of this, Diodorus tells us, that the\u017fe characters in Egypt were known only to a few, who were of the prie\u017fthood. But that in Ethiopia they were the national chara\u0107ter, and univer\u017fally \u201cunder\u017ftood. In \u017fhort, this writer a\u017f\u017fures us, that the rites in both nations had a great re\u017femblance, \u017fo as to be nearly the \u201c\u017fame. The prie\u017fts in each were reclu\u017fe, and given to celibacy\u2026\u201d - A New System, Or, An Analysis of Ancient Mythology: Wherein an Attempt is Made to Divest Tradition of Fable; and to Reduce the Truth to Its Original Purity ..., Jacob Bryant This helped give rise to the multi-racial tapestry of the ancient Egyptian population. We don\u2019t typically deny that Egypt was a melting pot that attracted different people of other nations. It\u2019s just the world that is dead set on downplaying the Ethiopian-Negroid involvement in Egypt to the point of sheer stupidity, when the Ethiopian element was actually the third largest element in Egypt, more so than other elements that may actually be classified as distinctly non-Negroid that don\u2019t have half as much history to back them up as the Ethiopian elements do, and the first and second largest elements are still technically classified as \u201cAfrican\u201d. And it\u2019s the Ethiopian element in Egypt the Jews of Lachich were compared to and said to be descended from anyways. However, this strays into the field of genetics when I\u2019ve not yet exhausted the findings of experts regarding the anthropology of Egypt, though I will say it is remarkable and not to be dismissed that a team of hundreds of subject matter experts working with the anthropological findings of Egypt for over 35 years for the United Nations came to the very same conclusions about the identities of the people who constituted ancient Egypt and the people who deny the Negroid involvement in Egypt:  United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization\u2019s Executive Board \u201cIt might have been thought that, working with physiological evidence, the findings of the anthropologists would dissipate all doubts by providing reliable and definitive truths. This is by no means so: the arbitrary nature of the criteria used, to go no farther, as well as abolishing any notion of a conclusion acceptable without qualification, introduces so much scientific hair-splitting that there are times when one wonders whether the solution of the problem would not have been nearer if we had not had the ill luck to approach it from this angle. Nevertheless, although the conclusions of these anthropological studies stop short of the full truth, they still speak unanimously of the existence of the negro race from the most distant ages of prehistory down to the dynastic period. It is not possible in this paper to cite all of these conclusions: they will be found summarized in Chapter X of Dr Emile Massoulard\u2019s Histoire et protohistoire d\u2019Egypte(Institut d\u2019Ethnologie, Paris, 1949). We shall quote selected items only. \u201cMiss Fawcett considers that the Negadeh skulls form a sufficiently homogeneous collection to warrant the assumption of a Negadeh race. In the total height of the skull, the auricular height, the length and breadth of the face, nasal length, cephalic index and facial index this race would seem to approximate the negro; in nasal breadth, height of the orbit, length of the palate and nasal index it would seem closer to the Germanic peoples; accordingly the Pre-Dynastic Negadians are likely to have resembled the negro in certain of the characteristic and the white races in others.\u201d(pp.402-3) It is worth noting that the nasal indices of Ethiopians and Dravidians would seem to approximate them to the Germanic peoples, though both are black races. These measurements, which would seem to leave an open choice between the two extremes represented by the negro and the Germanic races, give an idea of the elasticity of the criteria employed. A sample follows: \u201cAn attempt was made by Thomson and Randall MacIver to determine more precisely the importance of the negroid element in the series of skulls from El \u2018Amrah, Abydos and Hou. They divided them into three groups: (1) negroid skulls(those with a facial index below 54 and as nasal index above 50, i.e., short broad face and broad nose) (2)non-negroid skulls(facial index above 54 and nasal index below 50, long narrow face and narrow nose); intermediate skulls(assignable to one of the two previous groups on the basis of either the facial index or on the evidence of the nasal index, plus individuals marginal to either group). The proportion of negroid would seem to have been 24% of men and 19% of women in the early Predynastic and 25% and 28% respectively in the late predynastic. Kieth has disputed the value of the criterion selected by Thomson and Randall MacIver to distinguish negroid from non-negroid skulls. His opinion is that if the same criteria were applied to the study of any series of contemporary English skulls, the sample would be found to contain approximately 30% of negroid types.(pp. 420-1) The converse of Kieth\u2019s proposition could also be asserted, namely, that if the criterion were applied to the 140 million negroes now alive in black Africa a minimum of 100 million negroes would emerged whitewashed. It may also be remarked that the distinction between negroid, non-negroid and intermediary is unclear: the fact is that \u2018non-negroid\u2019 does not mean of the white race and \u2018intermediary\u2019 still less so.[\u2026.]The point about all these conclusions is that despite the their discrepancies the degree to which they converge proves that the basis of the Egyptian population was negro in the Pre-Dynastic epoch. Thus they are all incompatible with the theories that the negro element only infiltrated into Egypt at a later stage. Far otherwise, the facts prove that it was preponderant from the beginning to the end of Egyptian history, particularly when we note once more that \u2018Mediterranean\u2019 is not a synonym for \u2018white\u2019, Eliot Smith\u2019s \u2018brown or Mediterranean race being nearer the mark\u2019. \u2018Elliot-Smith classes these Proto-Egyptians as a branch of what he calls the brown race, which is the same as Sergi\u2019s \u2018Mediterranean or Eurafrican race\u2019. The term \u2018brown\u2019 in this context refers to skin color and is simply a euphamism for negro. It is thus clear that it was the whole of the Egyptian population which was negro, barring an infiltration of white nomads in the proto-dynastic epoch.[\u2026.] Be that as it may, it is clear that anthropology is far from having established the existence of a white Egyptian race and would tend to suggest the opposite. Nevertheless, in current textbooks the question is suppressed: in most cases it is simply and flatly asserted that the ancient Egyptians were white and the honest layman is left with the impression that any such assertion must necessarily have a prior basis of solid research. But there is no such basis, as this chapter has shown. And so generation after generation has been misled. Many authorities skate around the difficulty today by speaking of red-skinned and black-skinned whites without their sense of common logic being in the least upset.[\u2026] In a textbook intended for the middle secondary school we find the following sentence: \u2018A Black is distinguished less by the colour of his skin(for there are black-skinned \u201cwhites\u201d) than by his features: thick lips, flattened nose\u2026..It is only through these twistings of the basic definitions that it has been possible to bleach the Egyptian race.\u201d - General History of Africa: Ancient civilizations of Africa By G. Mokhtar, United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization. International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa pp.28, 29, 30 If I may, I\u2019d like to add that if Hebrew Israelites seem mean at times, there is a very, very, very large chance that it has something to do with people lying in the face of objective evidence that can\u2019t be argued with, like someone lying about stealing money that belonged to a bunch of terminally ill orphans when you have the camera footage that clearly shows his face and identification while he\u2019s stealing, but he refuses to admit to what he did, even when he sees the footage for himself. The same way it is simply and flatly asserted that the ancient Egyptians were white when there is no such basis for those claims is the same way it is simply and flatly asserted that the Jewish people were white when there is no such basis. The entire concept of pseudo-history, as noble as the intentions behind creating it may have been, has simply been hijacked and perverted to erase and invalidate valid history that is unfavorable to the people who have been writing history. The concept was only intended to safeguard against people abusing isolated sources of information in history without any tangible evidence to back them up, not entire historical records composed of multiple classical authors that confirmed each others reports across time and clear cut anthropological evidence that explains why they all said what they said. But this is the world we find ourselves in; people ask for evidence for what we claim with no intention of acknowledging it because they trust corrupt systems have adequatly diluted and erased all of it, then get angry when they find out it hasn\u2019t, and double down on the lies that have been sold to them because they consider it beneath them to admit they were wrong and we\u2019re right. So they slander us and try to bring us to an open shame, insisting that we are the ones who have perverted history. The act is disgusting to us and we tell people what we think about it. So, we\u2019re left with contention. But if the lies were simply thrown away, most of the contention would go with it, and peace and shalom would take it\u2019s place. Genetic References on the Jewish People As I have said, Egypt, or Mizraim, was in fact a melting pot. It attracted peoples of all different backgrounds in the processes of time, such as the Israelites and the Alexandrian Greeks and the Byzantine Greeks and the Persians and the modern Arabs. It is no surprise that a wide range of Y-DNA Haplotypes and Haplogroups have been found in Egypt. But so far as it has been determined, as has been hinted at previously, there are three main Haplotypes and their associated Haplogroups that make up the bulk of the genetic material present in Egypt. We know this to be an accurate assessment because the genetic information provides the same conclusion that anthropology does; that ancient Egypt definitely became more and more Negroid the further south one went, peaking in Nubia, and that just because some remains that appeared less Negroid in the North does not mean that they weren\u2019t Negroid, as demonstrated by the nasal indices of Negadian, Ethiopians and Dravidians that would appear to make them Germans, yet in reality, they are still very much Negroid peoples. The genetic profile of the Egyptian people tells the same story as the anthropological and historical record, and sheds invaluable light on the genetics of Israelite people they were intrinsically connected with: \u201cModern Egypt, the site of Africa\u2019s earliest state, lies near the crossroads of two other continents, and has had historic interactions with all its neighboring regions. This alone would make it an ideal place to study historical population biology. Egypt can also be conceptualized as a linear oasis in the eastern Sahara, one that traverses several regions of Africa. An oasis can be a way station or serve as a refugium, as well as be a place of settlement with its own special biological and cultural adaptive strategies. Both of these perspectives\u2014crossroads and oasis/refugium\u2014 can be expected to provide insight into the processes that could have affected the Nile valley\u2019s populations/peoples. From these vantage points this presentation will examine aspects of what might be called the historical genetics of the Nile valley, with a focus on the Y chromosome. The time-frame is the late pleistocene through holocene; within this there are different levels of biocultural history. Of special interest here is patterns of north-south variation in the Egyptian Nile valley. Bidirectional clinal variation in Egypt for various p49a,f TaqI Y RFLP haplotypes (Table 1) has been suggested to be likely related to specific military campaigns during and after the Middle Kingdom (Lucotte and Mercier 2003a). The events considered to have brought together northern and southern populations having different Y genetic profiles are: the Egyptian campaigns against and/or colonization of lower Nubia during the Middle and New Kingdoms (respectively primarily Dynasty XII, ca. 1991-1785 BCE, and Dynasty XVIII, beginning ca. 1490 BCE); the Nubian conquest of Egypt by the Napatan kingdom that created Dynasty XXV (ca. 730-655 BCE), centered near the fourth cataract (in the Republic of the Sudan); the conquest of Egypt during the Greco-Roman period by southern Europeans; and the migration of Arabic-speaking peoples from the Near East, and much later the Turks from Anatolia, both during the Islamic period. The first two of these have been suggested to explain the pattern of the three most common haplotypes: V, XI, and IV. The object of this paper is to examine and discuss further the observed patterns in Egypt for the p49a,f TaqI RFLP variants, based on current available data. This will be accomplished in two ways\u2014by examining haplotype frequencies in adjacent regions and by exploring data relevant to understanding the probable haplotype spatial variation in the Nile valley and its causes, beyond the events of the Middle Kingdom and afterwards. It is important to consider the issue of the original frequencies and origins of these variants in Egypt and other parts of Africa, as well as the adjacent regions. This is especially important given the ongoing tendency in some disciplines to label the Nile valley as Middle Eastern, in a fashion that effectively suggests that Egypt has no African context, and that also hides its biocultural Africanity in pre-Islamic times. The approach taken here is to examine early Egypt from multiple disciplines in order to construct the most likely \u201cnarrative\u201d that accounts for the facts as currently understood. It situates Egypt in a larger geographical and biogeographical context. The evidence to be primarily considered derives from published human biological studies, historical linguistics, and archeology. Although this presentation is not offered as a critique of previous literature, some repetition of published findings will be necessary for review, clarity, and emphasis. The term Taq comes from Thermus aquaticus, a bacterium that lives in extremely hot temperatures, and whose enzymes have proved valuable in techniques used to analyze DNA for population studies\u2014techniques that sometimes require high temperatures. The TaqI endonuclease, an enzyme, cleaves DNA at particular points. Various molecular instruments called probes, that use endonucleases, can be constructed to detect variations in segments of DNA. Such variations are also called polymorphisms, more specifically restriction fragment length polymorphisms or RFLPs. The TaqI probes were found to detect a subset of five fragments that varied between individuals and populations and was on the non-recombining part of the Y chromosome, and therefore strictly paternally inherited (Ngo et al. 1986; Lucotte and Mercier 2003a). The five fragments have different forms found to exist in different combinations. The different combinations for a stretch of DNA are called haplotypes, and can be conceptualized as a unit that is inherited. Each haplotype is given a numerical name. It should be noted that the same combination of TaqI fragments have occasionally arisen independently in different geographical populations. This is a case of parallel microevolution or independent mutation and can usually be distinguished from situations where migration and admixture have transferred a specific variant to another population. The specific haplotype prevalence and diversity in regions near Egypt, and/or ethnic groups historically originating in them, are suggested to be useful in assessing directions of gene flow (see Lucotte and Mercier 2003a, 2003b). Haplotype frequencies compiled and calculated from the literature are given in Tables 1, 2A, and 2B. Only the most frequently found haplotypes are reported. The most common variants found in different studies of Egypt collectively are, in descending frequency, V, XI, IV, VII, VIII, XV, and XII (Table 2A). The first three of these are of greatest interest due to their frequencies. Haplotype V, sometimes called \u201cArabic\u201d (Lucotte and Mercier 2003a) declines from lower Egypt (north) at 51.9%, to upper Egypt (24.2%), and to lower Nubia (south) at 17.4%. Haplotypes VII, VIII, XV, and XII also decline (Table 1). In contrast, haplotypes XI and IV, called \u201csouthern,\u201d with IV being labeled \u201csub-Saharan,\u201d have their lowest frequencies in lower Egypt (XI-11.7%; IV-1.2%), but increase in upper Egypt (XI-28.8%; IV-27.3%); and lower Nubia (XI-30.4%; IV- 39.1%); there is no statistically significant difference between the latter two regions (Lucotte and Mercier 2003a). Haplotypes VII and VIII are most prevalent in the Near East, and XII and XV in Europe. It is important to address the appellation of \u201cArabic\u201d for haplotype V, due to names being interpreted as indicators of origins, and the inconsistencies found in the literature. This variant is found in very high frequencies in supra-Saharan countries and Mauretania (collective average 55.0%), and in Ethiopia (average 45.8%) (Table 2A). In specific groups its highest prevalence is in samples from Moroccan Amazigh (Berbers) (68.9%) and Ethiopian Falasha (60.5%). Its frequency is considerably less in the Near East, and decreases from west (Lebanon, 16.7%) to east (Iraq, 7.2%) (Table 2A). The label \u201cArabic\u201d for V is therefore misleading because it suggests a Near Eastern origin. In fact this variant has been called \u201cAfrican\u201d (Lucotte et al. 1993:839, Lucotte et al. 1996:469), and \u201cBerberian\u201d (Lucotte et al. 2001:887). Significantly, and convincingly, it has been argued that because the Falasha, more properly Beta Israel (the \u201cblack Jews\u201d of Ethiopia, traditionally Cushitic, not Semitic speakers), have such a high frequency of V and XI and none (yet found) of VII and VIII, that this shows them to be \u201cclearly of African origin\u201d and to have adopted Judaism (Lucotte and Mercier 2003b: 669, Lucotte and Smets 1999). This is in contrast to their being the descendants of immigrant Near Eastern Jewish communities, whose males have high frequencies of VII and VIII collectively (Tables 2A, 2B). Ironically, a noteworthy frequency of VIII has been found in a non-Jewish Ethiopian population, and this is likely due to the known interactions with Arabia in the past (see Munro-Hay 1991), with some likely amplification by genetic drift. Given these findings, it is more accurate to call V \u201cHorn-supra-saharan African,\u201d not \u2018Arabic;\u2019 it is indigenous to Africa. The first speakers of Arabic, a Semitic language, came into Africa from the Near East. Using the same logic as applied to the Falasha, supra-Saharan Africans are primarily (but not solely) Arabic-speakers, due to language and cultural shift, and not settler colonization, as has been stated before based on biallelic lineage data (Bosch et al. 2001). High frequencies of VII and VIII characterize the indigenous core Arabic-speaking peoples of the Near East, and Jews also as noted (Tables 2A, 2B) (Lucotte and Mercier 2003b, al-Zahery et al. 2003, Lucotte et al. 1996, Lucotte et al. 1993, Santichiara-Benerecetti et al. 1993). There was no wholesale population replacement. This is not especially surprising because there is no evidence that the earliest Arabic-speakers, who came as teachers of Islam, intended to replace the indigenous populations biologically. There is further evidence from a phylogeographic perspective for the biohistorical Africanity of haplotype V. Biallelic markers on the non-recombining portion of the Y chromosome define clades that can be associated with the TaqI p49a,f variants (see e.g. al-Zahery et al 2003, who present a kind of genetic Rosetta stone). Haplotype V is associated with the M35/215 subclade, as is XI (in Africa), and IV with the M2/PN1/M180 subclade, both of the YAP/M145/M213 cluster. These lineages (\u201csubclades\u201d) subsuming haplotypes V/XI and IV, are joined by a transition mutation: \u201cmost notably the PN2 transition . . . unites two high frequency sub-clades, defined by M2/PN1/M180 mutations in sub- Saharan Africa, and M35/215 in north and east Africa.\u201d (Underhill et al. 2001:50). In one system of Y haplotype taxonomy, the subclades are in Group III (Bosch et al. 2001, Cruciani et. al. 2002). In another system of classification, these lineages are in haplogroup E (Hammer and Zegura 2002). The PN2 transition therefore defines a widespread clade. It is noteworthy that Group III is said to account for 73% of the variation in Africa (Underhill et al. 2001)... ...Haplotype IV, designating the M2/PN1 subclade, as noted, is found in high frequency in west, central, and sub-equatorial Africa in speakers of Niger-Congo\u2014which may have a special relationship with Nilosaharan\u2014 spoken by Nubians; together they might form a superphylum called Kongo-Saharan or Niger-Saharan (see Gregersen 1972, Blench 1995), but this is not fully supported. The spatial distribution of p49a,f TaqI haplotypes in the geographically-widespread speakers of Nilosaharan languages has not been fully characterized, but the notable presence of haplotype IV in Nubians speaking the Eastern Sudanic branch is interesting in that this subgroup is in the Sahelian branch of speakers, whose ancestors may have participated in the domestication of cattle in the eastern Sahara (Ehret 2000, Wendorf and Schild 2001). Sometimes haplotype IV (and the M2 lineage) is seen as being associated with the \u201cBantu expansion\u201d (~2000- 3000 bp), but this does not mean that it is not much older, since expansion and origin times cannot be conflated. Haplotype IV has substantial frequencies in upper Egypt and Nubia , greater than VII and VIII, and even V. Bantu languages were never spoken in these regions or Senegal, where M2 is greater than 90 percent in some studies. Haplotype XI has its highest frequencies in the Horn and the Nile valley, but has been called \u201cOriental\u201d (see Lucotte for this appellation 1996:469), which is also misleading. The high frequency in both Nilosaharan and Afroasiatic speakers in northeast Africa is striking. This haplotype has arisen independently several times as indicated by its affiliation with lineages defined by different biallelic markers (see e.g., al-Zahery 2003, O. Semino, personal communication). The notable frequency in Askenazic Jews is likely primarily of European, not African, origin (the EU19 lineage, see Passarino et al. 2000), or in haplogroup R (see al-Zahery 2003). In northwestern Africa (Tunisia) it is likely to be of both African and European origin due to the region\u2019s populations\u2019 various historical interactions with Europe. The widespread distribution of the PN2 clade in the major language phyla of Africa, its existence in the Levantine-Iraq region and even in the Aegean, and its likely post-glacial maximum date are significant and show how numerous bioculturally diverse peoples can be connected, even at relatively shallow time depths. This should give pause to those who have trouble escaping racial thinking. The diversification and early expansion of PN2 bearing populations likely started in the northeast quadrant of Africa (defined by bisecting the continent along its north-south axis and at the equator). This region is postulated to be the ancestral home of two of the three major language phyla of supra-equatorial Africa: Nilosaharan and Afroasiatic (Blench 1993, Ehret 1984, personal communication). It is significant that bearers of the PN2 mutation are geographically widespread and diverse in external morphology and language family affiliation. There is also biological diversity even within the speakers of language families (in their \u201chomelands\u201d) that could be seen by some as problematic. The range of external morphologies in the continental African speakers of Afroasiatic cannot be viewed as problematic from an evolutionary (versus racio-typological) perspective, and indicates the richness and complexity of indigenous African biocultural microevolution and its diversity (Hiernaux 1974, Keita and Kittles 1997, Kittles and Keita 1999). Conceptual racio-typological approaches that only interpret variation in terms of the interaction of primordial pre-existing distinct biocultural units will not easily explain phenomena like the PN2 distribution... ...Early speakers of Nilosaharan and Afroasiatic apparently interacted based on the evidence of loan words (Ehret, personal communication). Nilosaharan\u2019s current range is roughly congruent with the so-called Saharo-Sudanese or Aqualithic culture associated with the less arid period (Wendorf and Schild 1980), and therefore cannot be seen as intrusive. Its speakers are found from the Nile to the Niger rivers in the Sahara and Sahel, and south into Kenya. The eastern Sahara was likely a micro-evolutionary processor and pump of populations, who may have developed various specific sociocultural (and linguistic) identities, but were genealogically \u201cmixed\u201d in terms of origins. These identities may have further crystallized on the Nile, or fused with those of resident populations that were already differentiated. The genetic profile of the Nile Valley via the fusion of the Saharans and the indigenous peoples were likely established in the main long before the Middle Kingdom. Post-neolithic/predynastic population growth, as based on extrapolations from settlement patterns (Butzer 1976) would have led to relative genetic stability. The population of Egypt at the end of the pre-dynastic is estimated to have been greater than 800,000, but was not evenly distributed along the valley corridor, being most concentrated in locales of important settlements (Butzer 1976). Nubia, as noted, was less densely populated. Interactions between Nubia and Egypt (and the Sahara as well) occurred in the period between 4000 and 3000 BCE (the predynastic). There is evidence for sharing of some cultural traits between Sudan and Egypt in the neolithic (Kroeper 1996). Some items of \u201cmaterial\u201d culture were also shared in the phase called Naqada I between the Nubian A- Group and upper Egypt (~3900-3650 BCE). There is good evidence for a zone of cultural overlap versus an absolute boundary (Wilkinson 1999 after Hoffman 1982, and citing evidence from Needler 1984 and Adams 1996). Hoffman (1982) noted cattle burials in Hierakonpolis, the most important of predynastic upper Egyptian cities in the later predynastic. This custom might reflect Nubian cultural impact, a common cultural background, or the presence of Nubians. Whatever the case, there was some cultural and economic bases for all levels of social intercourse, as well as geographical proximity. There was some shared iconography in the kingdoms that emerged in Nubia and upper Egypt around 3300 BCE (Williams 1986). Although disputed, there is evidence that Nubia may have even militarily engaged upper Egypt before Dynasty I, and contributed leadership in the unification of Egypt (Williams 1986). The point of reviewing these data is to illustrate that the evidence suggests a basis for social interaction, and gene exchange. There is a caveat for lower Egypt. If neolithic/predynastic northern Egyptian populations were characterized at one time by higher frequencies of VII and VIII (from Near Eastern migration), then immigration from Saharan sources could have brought more V and XI in the later northern neolithic. It should further be noted that the ancient Egyptians interpreted their unifying king, Narmer (either the last of Dynasty 0, or the first of Dynasty I), as having been upper Egyptian and moving from south to north with victorious armies (Gardiner 1961, Wilkinson 1999). However, this may only be the heraldic \u201cfixation\u201d of an achieved political and cultural status quo (Hassan 1988), with little or no actual troup/population movements. Nevertheless, it is upper Egyptian (predynastic) culture that comes to dominate the country and emerges as the basis of dynastic civilization. Northern graves over the latter part of the predynastic do become like those in the south (see Bard 1994); some emigration to the north may have occurred\u2014of people as well as ideas... ...Taking a long and synthetic view, one compelling scenario is as follows: after the early late pleistocene/holocene establishment of Afroasiatic-speaking populations in the Nile valley and Sahara, who can be inferred to have been predominantly, but not only V (and XI), and of Nilosaharan folk in Nubia, Sudan, and Sahara (mainly XI and IV?), mid-holocene climatic-driven migrations led to a major settlement of the valley in upper Egypt and Nubia, but less so in lower Egypt, by diverse Saharans having haplotypes IV, XI, and V in proportions that would significantly influence the Nile valley-dwelling populations. These mid-Holocene Saharans are postulated to have been part of a process that led to a diverse but connected metapopulation. These peoples fused with the indigenous valley peoples, as did Near Easterners with VII and VIII, but perhaps also some V. With population growth the genetic profiles would became stabilized. Nubian and upper Egyptian proximity and on some level, shared culture, Nubia\u2019s possible participation in Egyptian state-building, and later partial political absorption in Dynasty I, would have reinforced biological overlap (and been further \u201cstabilized\u201d by ongoing population growth). - GENETICS, EGYPT, AND HISTORY: INTERPRETING GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS OF Y CHROMOSOME VARIATION1, S.O.Y.

JOHN\u2019S COLLEGE OXFORD UNIVERSITY There is a great deal more that I could share from this paper but I fear I\u2019ve already shared much in an answer that has already shared much and has much more to share. Why people feel bold enough to lie about the Ethiopian involvement in Egypt characterized as Haplotype IV in this study and others as Group III or Haplogroup E1B1a is beyond me. The DNA is there, the skulls and bones are there, the historical record are there. But, lo and behold, a conglomerate of arrogant fascist comes around and demands that everyone believe their version of history over what is actually recorded and confirmed by the legitimate evidence, or else they\u2019ll call you a racist. Yes, and this version of history necesarily demands that the Ethiopian contribution to the Egyptian populace was only ever in the form of the familiar groove of slavery or that blue moon event where the Kushites sieged control in the 25th Dynasty. Is that the truth?  This chart represents a study conducted by DNA Tribes on the genetic affinities of Pharaoh Amenhotep III of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt, his family and his in-laws, all of the Upper Egyptian nobility. They all cluster the strongest with Southern Africans, Great Lake Africans and Tropical West Africans today, just like the anthropologist Nancy C. Lovel said the research indicated Upper Egyptians clustered with Sub-Saharan peoples: \"There is now a sufficient body of evidence from modern studies of skeletal remains to indicate that the ancient Egyptians, especially southern Egyptians, exhibited physical characteristics that are within the range of variation for ancient and modern indigenous peoples of the Sahara and tropical Africa.. In general, the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara and more southerly areas.\u201d (Nancy C. Lovell, \" Egyptians, physical anthropology of,\" in Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, ed. Kathryn A. Bard and Steven Blake Shubert, ( London and New York: Routledge, 1999) pp 328-332) But I\u2019ve got lies for you? Like Amenhotep III or his wife Queen Tiye designated KV35EL weren\u2019t depicted as Ethiopians:  Amenhotep III, 9th Pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt \u201c\u2026Hansberry provides a twist to the thesis as it is presently debated. With his focus on the Eighteenth Dynasty, a dynasty that is decidedly Ethiopian, Hansberry has shifted Bernal\u2019s thesis to an Athena that is also decidedly black. Egypt of the Eighteenth Dynasty is Ethiopian. It is an Ethiopian Egypt that is at the height of it powers and international relations with states such as Minoan Crete. It is this Ethiopian Egypt that Hansberry argues is the key to Minoan expansion on the Greek mainland.\u201d - Maghan Keita, Race and the Writing of History: Riddling the Sphinx  Queen Tiye, The Elder Lady, Great Royal Wife of Amenhotep III As if, Haplotype IV isn\u2019t the highest frequency Haplotype in the region of the Great Lakes, Southern Africa and Tropical West Africa: Haplogroup E-V38 is a human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup. It is primarily distributed in Africa. E-V38 has two basal branches, E-M329 (formerly E1b1c or E1b1*) and E-M2 (formerly E3a & E1b1a). The E-M329 subclade is today almost exclusively found in Ethiopia. E-M2 is the predominant subclade in Western Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and the region of African Great Lakes, and occurs at moderate frequencies in North Africa, and the Middle East. - Haplogroup E-V38 - Wikipedia As if, it isn\u2019t a confirmed fact that two dynasties down in the 20th, Pharaoh Ramses III and his son Pentawer weren\u2019t confirmed carriers of Haplotype IV: \u201cThe Zink unit determined that the mummy of an unknown man buried with Ramesses was, because of the proven genetic relationship and a mummification process that suggested punishment, a good candidate for the pharaoh's son, Pentaweret, who was the only son to revolt against his father. It was impossible to determine his cause of death. Both mummies were predicted by the STR-predictor to share the Y chromosomal haplogroup E1b1a1-M2 and 50% of their genetic material, which pointed to a father-son relationship.\u201d[23] - Ramesses III - Wikipedia Meanwhile, in other news, this just in, them boys are over there trying to get you to sign off on the idea that the Ethiopian element that existed in Egypt since before it began as a state all the way to the very end was nothing more than a servant underclass and I\u2019m a bigoted racist for proving them wrong many times over, and classical authors didn\u2019t know a damn thing about what they were talking about when they told you the Egyptians and Ethiopians both had black skins and kinky hair. Right. Don\u2019t worry. Everything\u2019s o.k. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not what it looks like. The purpose of everything I\u2019ve shared here is to cement the Ethiopian relationship with and nature of Egypt genetically, in addition to the anthropological and historical record, which combined with the weight of classical authors on the Egypto-Ethiopian heritage of the Jewish people and the Egypto-Ethiopian remains excavated from the prominent Jewish city of Lachich, there can be no doubt as to who the Jewish people were. The Lachich type were identical matches with the Kerma Sudanese type of the day and they would have possessed a similar cocktail of haplotypes as the Kerma Sudanese did; a large proportion of haplotype IV, which has alternately been classified as E-M2 or haplogroup E1B1a - the predominate African-American haplogroup - because of its association with the Bantu expansions, a smaller proportion of haplotype XI, which has been alternately classed as an E haplogroup when present in \u201cAfricans\u201d but as R1 haplogroup when present in Europeans, being labeled \u201cOriental\u201d even though it\u2019s strongest presence is in the Nile Valley and Horn of Africa, and a smaller proportion of haplogroups V, misleadingly called Arabic, and largely associated with haplogroups E1B1b. It is worth noting that all of these Haplotypes and their associated haplogroups are found today in Sub-Saharan Africa and the African Slave Trade Diaspora: \u201cOne Y-specific DNA polymorphism (p49/Taql) was studied in a sample of 469 African males coming from twelve populations of sub-Saharan Africa. An high frequency (62.5%) of the Y-haplotype IV was observed in these populations, the most elevated percentage of this haplotype being observed in Mossis (from Burkina-Fasso). The \u201cArabic\u201d haplotype V is present in these populations at a mean frequency of 8.7%. The \u201coriental\u201d haplotype XI is present at a mean frequency of 11.3%, the most elevated percentage of this haplotype being observed in Songhaiis (from Niger).\u201d\u2014Lucotte G. and G\u00e9rard N. 2000, Haplotypes of the Y chromosome in some populations of west Africa Therefore the very same Haplotypes and Haplogroups found within African-Americans and the Trans-Saharan and Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Diaspora, are the same haplotypes and haplogroups that would have been found in the inhabitants of Lachich, whose closest anthropological matches were the Egyptians, Kushites and of course, African-Americans, hence, the Hebrew Israelites claiming Jewish heritage all over the world. And this all makes perfect sense considering the vast array of records of Negroid Jews in Sub Saharan Africa, and Africa as a whole after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. Post 70 AD References on the Jews  Luke 21:20-24 King James Version 20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. 21 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. 22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. 23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people. 24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. The destruction of Jerusalem at the hands of the Romans was a massacre. According to Josephus, over 1,000,000 Jews were slaughtered. Some were enslaved in different parts of Roman territories immediatley. Others managed to flee into relative safety, or at least for a time. One of these places that the Jews are documented fleeing to, was actually Egypt, where a large population of Jews had already settled from the time of Alexander the Great: \u201cFurther waves of Jewish immigrants settled in Egypt during the Ptolemaic era, especially around Alexandria. Thus, their history in this period centers almost completely on Alexandria, though daughter communities rose up in places like the present Kafr ed-Dawar, and Jews served in the administration as custodians of the river.[11] As early as the 3rd century BCE, one can speak of a widespread diaspora of Jews in many Egyptian towns and cities. In Josephus's history, it is claimed that, after the first Ptolemy took Judea, he led some 120,000 Jewish captives to Egypt from the areas of Judea, Jerusalem, Samaria, and Mount Gerizim. With them, many other Jews, attracted by the fertile soil and Ptolemy's liberality, emigrated there of their own accord. An inscription recording a Jewish dedication of a synagogue to Ptolemy and Berenice was discovered in the 19th century near Alexandria.[12] Josephus also claims that, soon after, these 120,000 captives were freed from bondage by Philadelphus.[13] The history of the Alexandrian Jews dates from the foundation of the city by Alexander the Great, 332 BCE, at which they were present. They were numerous from the very outset, forming a notable portion of the city's population under Alexander's successors. The Ptolemies assigned them a separate section, two of the five districts of the city, to enable them to keep their laws pure of indigenous cultic influences. The Alexandrian Jews enjoyed a greater degree of political independence than elsewhere. While the Jewish population elsewhere throughout the later Roman Empire frequently formed private societies for religious purposes, or organized corporations of ethnic groups like the Egyptian and Phoenician merchants in the large commercial centers, those of Alexandria constituted an independent political community, side by side with that of the other ethnic groups.[14] For the Roman period, there is evidence that at Oxyrynchus (modern Behneseh), on the west side of the Nile, there was a Jewish community of some importance. Many of the Jews there may have become Christians, though they retained their Biblical names (e.g., \"David\" and \"Elisabeth,\" occurring in litigation concerning an inheritance). There is even found a certain Jacob, son of Achilles (c. 300 CE), as beadle of an Egyptian temple. The Hellenistic Jewish community of Alexandria translated the Old Testament into Greek. This translation is called the Septuagint. The translation of the Septuagint itself began in the 3rd century BCE and was completed by 132 BCE,[15][16][17] initially in Alexandria, but in time elsewhere as well.[18] It became the source for the Old Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Old Armenian, Old Georgian and Coptic versions of the Christian Old Testament.[19] The Jewish community of Alexandria was \"extinguished\" by Trajan's army during the Kitos War of 115\u2013117 CE, also known as the Diaspora Revolt.[20] The Jewish revolt, which is said to have begun in Cyrene and spread to Egypt, was largely motivated by religious zealotry, aggravation after the failed Great Revolt and destruction of the Temple, and anger at discriminatory laws.[21] The greatest blow Alexandrian Jews received was during the Byzantine Empire rule and the rise of a new state religion: Christianity. There was an expulsion of a large amount of Jews from Alexandria (the so-called \"Alexandria Expulsion\") in 414 or 415 A.D. by Saint Cyril, following a number of controversies, including threats from Cyril and supposedly (according to Christian historian Socrates Scholasticus) a Jewish-led massacre in response. Later violence took on a decidedly anti-Semitic context with calls for ethnic cleansing. Before that time, state/religious-sanctioned claims of a Jewish pariah were not common.[22] Gibbon in his The history of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, chapter 47, describes the Alexandria pogrom: Without any legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the patriarch (Saint Cyril), at the dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to the attack of the synagogues. Unarmed and unprepared, the Jews were incapable of resistance; their houses of prayer were leveled with the ground, and the episcopal warrior, after rewarding his troops with the plunder of their goods, expelled from the city the remnant of the unbelieving nation.[23] - History of the Jews in Egypt - Wikipedia Of course, Jesus said these things would happen to us: John 16:1-4 King James Version 16 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. 2 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. 3 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. 4 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. The God of Israel\u2019s word is bond. What he says is what will come to pass. You can be sure of it. It was the Eastern Roman Catholic church that committed these crimes against us in Egypt, it was the Western Roman Catholic Church that authorized the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and all the atrocities of it against us. And in whose name do they say they did these things in? In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. But the Father said they don\u2019t know him and Jesus said they don\u2019t know him. Why people look to the Roman Catholics and their daughter denominations for spiritual guidance then is beyond me. Matthew 7:21-23 King James Version 21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. But aren\u2019t these the people that have taught the world that you no longer have to do the will of the Father who is in heaven because all of God\u2019s laws, statutes and commandments have been done away with? Don\u2019t they teach that we may honor pagan gods by celebrating all of Rome\u2019s holidays that we keep today? Don\u2019t they teach that the people of Israel are divorced from God and forsaken forever, and that they, the Christian church, are the people of Israel and the wife of God now? Revelation 18 King James Version 18 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. 2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. 3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. 4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. 5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. 6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double. 7 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. 8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her. 9 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning, 10 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come. 11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more: 12 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble, 13 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men. 14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all. 15 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, 16 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! 17 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, 18 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city! 19 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate. 20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. 21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. 22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; 23 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth. So who is telling the truth? Is God telling the truth or is man telling the truth? Have all nations been deceived by the Roman Catholic Church and European slave traders who traded men with ships, or is God the one that\u2019s lying to you? Jeremiah 17:5 King James Version 5 Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord. God said the blood of the prophets and the saints was found in Babylon correct? What did the Eastern Roman Empire do to the Jews? \u201cSome authors estimate that around 100 thousand Jews were expelled from the city.[24][25] The expulsion then continued in the nearby regions of Egypt and Palestine followed by a forced Christianization of the Jews[citation needed]. The Arab invasion of Egypt at first found support from Jewish residents as well, disgruntled by the corrupt administration of the Patriarch Cyrus of Alexandria, notorious for his Monotheletic proselytizing.[26] In addition to the Jewish population settled there from ancient times, some are said to have come from the Arabian Peninsula. The letter sent by Muhammad to the Jewish Banu Janba in 630[27] is said by Al-Baladhuri to have been seen in Egypt. A copy, written in Hebrew characters, has been found in the Cairo Geniza. Many Jewish residents had no reason to feel kindly toward the former masters of Egypt. In 629 the Emperor Heraclius I had driven the Jewish population from Jerusalem, and this was followed by massacres of Jewish residents throughout the empire\u2014in Egypt, often aided by the Coptic population, who may have been trying to settle old grievances against Jewish groups, dating from the Persian conquest of Amida at the time of Emperor Anastasius I (502) and of Alexandria by the Persian general Shahin Vahmanzadegan (617), when some of the Jewish residents sided with the conquerors.[citation needed] The Treaty of Alexandria (November 8, 641), which sealed the Arab conquest of Egypt, expressly stipulated that the Jewish residents were to be allowed to remain in that city unmolested; and at the time of the capture of that city, 'Amr ibn al-'As, in his letter to the caliph, relates that he found there 40,000 Jews.[citation needed] Of the fortunes of the Jewish population of Egypt under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates (641\u2013868), little is known. Under the Tulunids (863-905), the Karaite community enjoyed robust growth.\u201d - History of the Jews in Egypt - Wikipedia The blood of the people of Israel is found shed in Rome and all of her daughter nations indeed. As you can see, the history of the Jews in Africa beginning in Egypt is very well documented and so are the crimes the Romans and their descendants have committed against us, as is written. But as S.O.Y. Keita and A.J. Boyce noted in their paper on the genetic history of Egypt, there is a very real effort among academics to conceal the Africanity of Egypt, and the Jewish people are necessarily included in this concealment. Right now there are actually people upset at me for claiming the history of the Jews in Egypt as my own because they feel I should say it\u2019s the Ashkenazi\u2019s history. They bet if we just looked a little closer we would find out that the Ashkenazi were the only people called Jews to be found in Egypt and I\u2019d be revealed to be a big, mean old liar. How much are you willing to bet? \u201cKnow that the land of Egypt, when the Mussulmans entered it, was full of Christians, but divided amongst themselves in two sects, both as to race and religion. The one part was made up of men about the court and public affairs, all Greek, from among the soldiers of Constantinople, the seat of government of Rum; their views, as well as their religion, were for all of them, Melkite; and their number was above three hundred thousand, all Greeks. The other portion was the whole people of Egypt, who were called Qibt, and were of mixed descent; among whom one could not distinguish Copt from Abyssinian, Nubian or Israelite; and they were all Jacobites. Some of them were writers in government offices, others were merchants and tradesmen, others were bishops and prebysters and such like, others were tillers of the land in the country, while others were of the class of servants and domestics. But between these and the Melkite or ruling population, marriages were not allowed, from mutual hatred of each other, often carried to murders on either side. The number of these people rose to very many twenties of thousands; for they were, in fact, the people of the land of Egypt, both Upper and Lower.\u201d - A Short History of the Copts and of Their Church, A\u1e25mad ibn \u02bbAl\u012b Maqr\u012bz\u012bJan 1873 Nothing\u2019s changed since Egypt, Egypt just grew to be the entire world because the Greco-Roman Melkites still control it. And they still murder us and get away with it in this life. And they still scream Jesus when they do it. And they still don\u2019t know Jesus. And we\u2019re still the same old Israelites that were indistinguishable from the Nubian Ethiopians from the beginning. And we\u2019re still Jacobite Christians who do our best to honor the laws, statutes and commandments of the Most High God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And the Ashkenazi people came out of nowhere claiming to be us, and our Greco-Roman Melkite persecutors rolled with it when they enslaved us and brainwashed us. What apology does the world say we owe, that the world does not owe us? Like we\u2019re actually counting on it. Like we believe all these people really have it in them to come clean and make amends for their part in destroying the Israelite people when they had the opportunity to do so. They make it clear they have no intentions of honoring the actual evidence from the very beginning because their story is already made up. Psalm 83 King James Version 83 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. 2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. 4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: 6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; 7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. 9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: 10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. 11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: 12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. 13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. 14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; 15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. 16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O Lord. 17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: 18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the most high over all the earth. The UNESCO team found from the anthropological evidence that the Egyptian population was in fact Negroid, with varitations of intensity of Negroid features that seemed to constitute several different Negroid races, to wit, Nubian and Abyssinian types mixed together. The work of S.O.Y. Keita and A.J. Boyce on the genetic history of Egypt found that the three greatest Haplotypes in Egypt were Haplotype V, a Haplotype characteristic of Abyssinians and Copts, Haplotype IV, a Haplotype characteristic of Nubians and Israelites, and Haplotype XI, characteristic of both groups. The modern Arabs found that the entire population of Egypt in the 7th Century CE was comprised of Copts, Abyssinians, Nubians and Israelites that could not be distinguished from each other while the Greeks who occupied Egypt were not counted among the Egyptian population. But my friends find Greek and Roman remains and DNA in Egypt and swear on all they own that those were the Egyptian people and the people actually recorded as the Egyptian people were nothing but slaves. Stealing another peoples identity and homeland and culture and calling them racial epithets is a really sad and twisted and obnoxious thing right? It triggers the outrage of the masses right? So where is it? Where is all of the fury and righteous indignation that people had for us? Oh, I see. People can only afford to have righteous indignation against us because we\u2019re Black, broken and impoverished and can\u2019t defend ourselves because of our low status. People can\u2019t give the same response to people in power who are actually guilty of the crime we are accused of because they are rich and influential and they will try to take everything away from you if you disagree with them. This is the way of the world; Crookedness, corruption, bribery, lies, deceit, quid pro quo, racism, classism, hypocracy, tyranny, oppression, murder, robbery, pervesness, Godlessness. And people are really willing to look me in my eyes and tell me I am evil for standing up for what is right because our way is to do the right thing: Isaiah 5:20 King James Version 20 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! It\u2019s a righteous thing to tell the truth but few people are willing to do it because the truth hurts and telling it makes people want to hurt you in return. But I fear God more than I fear man, and I fear what he will do to my people if they never turn back to their heritage and doing the right thing in his eyes. So I tell the truth.

The residents, all Muslims, are members of a tribe whose name means \u201csons of Israel,\u201d and they trace their lineage to two clans \u2014 Sylla and Drame \u2014 they say are descended from Egyptian Jews. \u201cWe are all practicing Muslims and we don\u2019t want to become Jewish,\u201d Fadiga says. \u201cIn fact, we don\u2019t like to talk too much about our Jewish background, but we don\u2019t hide it either. We know our people came from Egypt to Somalia, and from there to Nigeria, where they split about 1,000 years ago. One branch of the two families went to Mali, another to Guinea, and we settled here.\u201d The truth of such claims is difficult to establish, but West Africa has had a documented Jewish presence since at least the 14th century, when several Jewish merchants set up shop in Timbuktu, in western Mali. Jews kept trickling in from Spain and Portugal during the Inquisition of the 15th and 16th centuries, and later from Morocco...\u201d - In Senegalese bush, Bani Israel tribe claims Jewish heritage We know well and good the Jewish people once possesed 2/5 of the land of Egypt. We know well and good the Jewish people were said to be descendants of the Egyptians and Ethiopians. We know well and good the Jewish people were said to be indistinguishable from the Nubian people who were a part of Egypt. \u201cThe Greeks, however, did not call these people \"Nubians\" or \"Kushites,\" as we do today; they called them Aithiopes (\"Ethiopians\"), which in Greek meant \"Burnt-Faced Ones.\" They knew perfectly well that Nubians were black-skinned, as are the Sudanese of the same regions today.\u201d - Timothy Kendall, Black Kingdoms of the Nile, Racism and the Rediscovery of Ancient Nubia, Wonders of the African World But they want to tell you that the Jews who left Egypt and were recorded all over Africa weren\u2019t black-skinned because they were the Ashkenazi people. They have no morals, no ethics, no code, no dignity, no honor, no faith, no respect, no religion, no values, no shame, nothing. Retrace the steps of Mr. Fadiga\u2019s ancestors journey from Egypt to Senegal and in every location you will find the record of Negroid Jews, and I, a descendant of the trans-atlantic slave trade posses DNA from every single step of the way, because the places these Negroid Jews lived were also the targets of the Trans-Saharan and Trans-Atlantic slave traders. The Jews from Portugal and Spain and other places in Europe that fled to Mali were of the same Negroid stock. But beginning in 8th Century Somalia after the Jews were expelled from Egypt, keeping in time with Mr. Fadiga\u2019s timetable of his people having migrated to Nigeria from there roughly 1,000 years ago, a Chinese explorer named Du Huan gave an interesting account of the people of East Africa and the customs they kept: \u201cWe also went to Molin, southwest of Jerusalem. One could reach this country after having crossed the great desert of Sinai and having travelled 2,000 li (approx. 1000 km). The people there are black, and their customs are bold. There is little rice and cereals, with no grass and trees on this land. The horses are fed with dried fish, and the people eat Gumang. Gumang is a Persian date. Subtropical diseases (Malaria) are widespread. After crossing into the inland countries there is a mountainous country, which gathered a lot of confessions here. They have three confessions, the Arab (Islam), Byzantine (Christianity) and Zimzim (Judaism). The Zimzim practise incest, and in this respect are worst of all the barbarians. The followers under the confession of Arab have a means to denote in law, while not entangling the defendant's families or kins. They don't eat the meat of pigs, dogs, donkeys and horses; they don't respect either the king of the country, nor their parents; they don't believe in supernatural powers, perform only sacrifice to heaven (Allah) and to no one else. According to their customs, every seventh day is a holiday (Jumu'ah), on which no trade and no currency transactions are done, whereas when they drink alcohol, and behave in a ridiculous and undisciplined way during the whole day. Within the confession of the Byzantines, there are beneficent medical doctors who know diarrhea; they could either recognize the disease before its outbreak, or could remove the worms by opening the brain.[1][2][3]\u201d - Du Huan - Wikipedia Except, there is no seventh day holiday where buying and selling is forbidden in the Islamic religion. This is a distinct custom of the Israelite people inherited from the God of Israel: Exodus 31:12-18 King James Version 12 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. 14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. 16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. 18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. This indicates that these Black people in East Africa who followed the Torah in certain aspects were the dispersed of the children of Israel who followed the \u201cJacobite\u201d religion in Egypt, or other locations nearby in the Middle East such as Yemen, where other Israelites were said to have come to Egypt from when the Arabs deposed the Romans. My own genetic testing has consistently yielded both North and East African DNA across different platforms, and in one case, I am connected specifically with Somalia. To this very day, there are oppressed inhabitants of the region who call themselves the \u201cYibir\u201d, or Hebrew people: \u201cIn 2000, New York Times journalist Ian Fisher conducted a breakthrough interview with the Yibir community leader Sultan Ahmed Jama. The Sultan was not secretive about his Hebraic heritage and indicated that the prejudice his people experience in Somalia essentially goes back to their Israelite heritage. He also pointed out that members of the community \u2013particularly the youth\u2013 are often ashamed of their Yibir identity as a low caste. Accordingly, they often identify with other clans of higher castes. Yibir folklore suggests that the community\u2019s ancestors converted from Judaism to Islam in the thirteenth century. Since scholars believe that Sharif Yusuf lived in the early thirteenth century, the events of the traditional narrative, involving the Sharif and the Yibir leader Mohamed Hanif, would accordingly date to the same century. And although the name Mohamed Hanif is evidently Muslim, it is perhaps possible that the Yibir did not entirely abandon Judaism until Sharif Yusuf subjugated them. In any case, and as indicated, Somali traditions claim that Mohamed Hanif was not a true Muslim and seem to suggest that he was of a different religion. Traditionally, the Yibir claim that their Jewish ancestors arrived in Somalia prior to the formation of the major noble Samaale clans, i.e. Darood, Dir, Hawiye and Isaaq. While Samaale clans commonly trace their paternal lineages to ninth century Arabian ancestors, some scholars have suggested that the Darood and Isaaq were only founded in the thirteenth century. If this is true, then the Yibir are also likely to be older than the two Samaale clans. That is because the Yibir were, presumably, already established as a powerful group in Somalia by the time of Mohamed Hanif in the thirteenth century.\u201d - Ethiopian Jews in Somalia: Tracing remnants of the Yibir | Genetic Literacy Project For the record, the land of Cush is exactly where the God of Israel has promised to recover the remnant of the dispersed children of Israel upon his return, among many other places, because it is written that the people of Judah would be dispersed into all corners of the earth. Isaiah 11:10-12 King James Version 10 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious. 11 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 12 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. Connected with this also is the fact that the God of Israel has expressly stated the descendants of his people would return to him from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, which is the Nile, and what lays beyond it is West Africa... Zephaniah 3:10-12 King James Version 10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. 11 In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. 12 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord. ... In places such as Nigeria, where millions of Igbo people maintain that they are the Jewish and have practiced Jewish customs and traditions for hundreds of years, the same place Mr. Fadiga said the families of Israel who migrated from Egypt split to Mali, Guinea and Senegal one thousand years ago: \u201cThe history of the Jews in Nigeria is a complex subject. The historic presence of Judaism in Nigeria is a cause of debate, as there are several Judaic-oriented religious groups among the largest ethnic groups in the largely populated nation. The groups claim that their religious practices result either from hundreds of years of continuous practice of Judaic or Judaic-like customs by their ethnic groups, customs inherited from the Jews of Bilad el-Sudan or by a more-recent departure from European Christianity to modern Judaism. Either way, Judaism in Nigeria has developed demographically with the interest of Jewish peoples in other countries, especially Israel and the United States.\u201d - History of the Jews in Nigeria - Wikipedia Of course, I speak to Igbo people because they are accessible to me, which is usually a fun experience because they all know they are Jews unlike my brothers and sisters in the Americas that have been brainwashed through the worst form of slavery the world has ever seen and assimilated into the society that perpetrated it, 32% of my DNA is supposed to be derived from people stolen from Nigeria, of which, 1.4 million Igbo\u2019s are thought to have been trafficked in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. But as the Wikipedia excerpt has expressed, the presence of such a large, established community of Torah observant Negroes in Africa who have claimed Jewish heritage for hundreds of years is a cause of debate because it runs contrary to the lie told by the world that the people of Africa were savages without God or law. In a perfect world, the world would deny that there was any presence of the Jews in Africa, but because this is impossible, more excuses and lies then have to be made to keep the status quo in excellent condition. \u201cThe Igbo must have been converts to Judaism from white, Ashkenazi migrants from the East.\u201d, is what is said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the Nigerian Jews were influenced by the Jews of Bilad al-Sudan, who must have been white.\u201d, is what they hope. But they don\u2019t dress it up as hope. They dress it up as if it were fact and arrogantly shove it in your face as if it\u2019s outside of your ability to fact check them with what history has actually recorded and pull the lie right from off the tip of their tongues. Who were the Jews of Bilad al-Sudan? \u201cJews of the Bilad al-Sudan (Judeo-Arabic: \u05d0\u05b7\u05d4\u05b7\u05dc \u05d9\u05b7\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05bc \u05d1\u05b4\u05bc\u05dc\u05b7\u05d3\u05bc \u05d0\u05b7\u05dc \u05e1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05df) describes West African Jewish communities who were connected to known Jewish communities from the Middle East, North Africa, or Spain and Portugal. Various historical records attest to their presence at one time in the Ghana, Mali, and Songhai empires, then called the Bilad as-Sudan from the Arabic meaning Land of the Blacks. Jews from Spain, Portugal, and Morocco in later years also formed communities off the coast of Senegal and on the Islands of Cape Verde. These communities continued to exist for hundreds of years but have since disappeared due to changing social conditions, persecution, migration, and assimilation. According to most accounts, the earliest Jewish settlements in Africa were in places such as Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco. Jews had settled along the Upper Nile at Elephantine in Egypt. These communities were augmented by subsequent arrivals of Jews after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, when 30,000 Jewish slaves were settled throughout Carthage by the Roman emperor Titus. Africa is identified in various Jewish sources in connection with Tarshish and Ophir.[1] The Septuagint,[2] and Jerome,[3] who was taught by Jews, and very often the Aramaic Targum on the Prophets, identify the Biblical Tarshish with Carthage, which was the birthplace of a number of rabbis mentioned in the Talmud. Africa, in the broader sense, is clearly indicated where mention is made of the Ten Tribes having been driven into exile by the Assyrians and having journeyed into Africa.[4] Connected with this is the idea that the river Sambation is in Africa. The Arabs, who also know the legend of the Beni Musa (\"Sons of Moses\"), agree with the Jews in placing their land in Africa. As early as Roman times, Moroccan Jews had begun to travel inland to trade with groups of Berbers, most of whom were nomads who dwelt in remote areas of the Atlas Mountains. Jews lived side by side with Berbers, forging both economic and cultural ties; some Berbers even began to practice Judaism. In response, Berbers spirituality transformed Jewish ritual, painting it with a belief in the power of demons and saints. When the Muslims swept across the North of Africa, Jews and Berbers defied them together. Across the Atlas Mountains, the legendary Queen Kahina led a tribe of 7th century Berbers, Jews, and other North African ethnic groups in battle against encroaching Islamic warriors. In the 10th century, as the social and political environment in Baghdad became increasingly hostile to Jews, many Jewish traders there left for the Maghreb, Tunisia in particular. Over the following two to three centuries, a distinctive social group of traders throughout the Mediterranean world became known as the Maghrebi, passing on this identification from father to son. According to certain local Malian legends a mention in the Tarikh al-Sudan may have recorded the first Jewish presence in West Africa with the arrival of the first Zuwa ruler of Koukiya and his brother, located near the Niger River. He was known only as Za/Zuwa Alayman (meaning \"He comes from Yemen\"). Some local legends state that Zuwa Alayman was a member of one of the Jewish communities that were either transported or voluntarily moved from Yemen by the Ethiopians in the 6th century C.E. after the defeat of Dhu Nuwas. The Tarikh al-Sudan, states that there were 14 Zuwa rulers of Kukiya after Zuwa Alyaman before the rise of Islam in the region.[5] There is debate on whether or not the Tarikh es-Soudan can be understood in this manner. Manuscript C of the Tarikh al-fattash describes a community called the Bani Israeel that in 1402 CE existed in Tindirma, possessed 333 wells, and had seven leaders: Jabroot bin-Hashim Thoelyaman bin-Abdel Hakim Zeor bin-Salam Abdel-latif bin-Solayman Malik bin-Ayoob Fadil bin-Mzar Shaleb bin-Yousef It is also stated that they had an army of 1500 men.[6] Other sources say that other Jewish communities in the region were formed by migrations from Morocco, Egypt, and Portugal. When the Scottish explorer Mungo Park traveled through West Africa in the late 18th century he was informed by an Arab he met near Walata of there being many Arabic speaking Jews in Timbuktu whose prayers were similar to the Moors.[7] Some communities are said to have been populated by certain Berber Jews like a group of Kal Tamasheq known as Iddao Ishaak that traveled from North Africa into West Africa for trade, as well as those escaping the Islamic invasions into North Africa.[8] In the 14th century many Moors and Jews, fleeing persecution in Spain, migrated south to the Timbuktu area, at that time part of the Songhai Empire. Among them was the Kehath (Ka'ti) family, descended from Ismael Jan Kot Al-yahudi of Scheida, Morocco. Sons of this prominent family founded three villages that still exist near Timbuktu -- Kirshamba, Haybomo, and Kongougara. In 1492, Askia Mohammad I came to power in the previously tolerant region of Timbuktu and decreed that Jews must convert to Islam or leave; Judaism became illegal in Mali, as it did in Catholic Spain that same year. This was based on the advice of Muhammad al-Maghili. As the historian Leo Africanus wrote in 1526: \"In Garura there were some very rich Jews. The intervention of the preacher (Muhammid al-Maghili) of Tlemcen set up the pillage of their goods, and most of them have been killed by the population. This event took place during the same year when the Jews had been expelled from Spain and Sicily by the Catholic King.\" Leo Africanus further wrote: \"The king (Askia) is a declared enemy of the Jews. He will not allow any to live in the city. If he hears it said that a Berber merchant frequents them or does business with them, he confiscates his goods.\" - Jews of Bilad el-Sudan - Wikipedia Bilad al-Sudan, \u201cThe Land of the Blacks\u201d or \u201cNegroland\u201d formed a sort of last bastion for the Israelite people in the old world as persecution of the Jews reached a fever pitch in Europe and the Middle East. But the persecution soon followed them in Africa, as the God of Israel said it would: Jeremiah 9:16 King James Version 16 I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them. These were the \u201cchanging social conditions\u201d mentioned in the article. That and slavery to the Arabs and Europeans. And they were Negroes. As is usual, sources like Wikipedia on the Jews are good for general information and sources to pursue, but when it comes to articles mentioning the actual identity of the Jewish people in Africa and elsewhere hundreds of years ago, Wikipedia contributors become strangely silent and complicit in letting on that the Jews were white when they are recorded as black: \u201cSo much for the Whites. We shall treat of the Blacks when we come to Guinea, Negroland, and the Cape if Good Hope, where they inhabit. Leo says, there are other Kingdoms on the S. Frontiers of this country inhabited by a rich, industrious, and just Sort of People. Judaism was the Religion of the ancient Africans for a long Time, and succeeded by Christianity; but Mohometanism prevail\u2019d in the 208th year of the Hegyra, when all the Jews, Christians and Professors of the African Religion that could be found, were put to death; yet in Process of Time their intestine Quarrels made them neglect Mohomet\u2019s Law, and revolt from the Caliph of Bagdat, for which they were severely punish\u2019d by the Mohometan Caliphs, who caus\u2019d all their Books to be burnt, on Suspicion that the knowledge of the Arts and Sciences prompted them to contemn Mohomet\u2019s Law... The present Christians in Africa are partly Strangers, and partly Natives, some of them slaves to the Turks and Barbarians, and others free. Some of the Jews who inhabit both Sides the Niger derive themselves from Abraham. Others fled hither from Asia when Vespasian destroy\u2019d Jerusalem, it from Judea when t\u2019was wasted by the Romans, Persians, Saracens, and Christians. Some were banish\u2019d from Italy in 1342, from Spain in 1462, from the Low Countries in 1350, from France in 1403, and from England in 1422. These all differ in Habit, and are divided into several wealthy and numerous Tribes, but have no Dominion, are despis\u2019d of all Nations, and so abominated by the Turks that they are not admitted to be Mohometans unless first baptiz\u2019d, and then made use of only to receive their Customs, and gather in their Taxes.\u201d - For Africa: Containing What is of Most Use in Bleau, Varenius, Cellarius, Cluverius, Baudrand, Brietius, Sanson, &c. ; With The Discoveries and Improvements of the Best Modern Authors to this Time, 1714, pg 39 The authors of this text said they would deal with the Blacks when it comes to the Jews of Africa for a reason. The Jews are reported to have inhabited both sides of the Niger River, which is related to the byword \u201cNigger\u201d that Romans and their descendants have grown fond of calling us. And again, Mr. Fadiga\u2019s story of Jewish migration from Egypt, to Somalia, to Nigeria, to Mali(Negroland), Senegal and Guinea is supported, but this time with the addition of several waves of Jews from European nations. It may be helpful to inquire into the reputation of the Jews that fled Europe in order to get a better idea of their features, beginning in France: \u201cWhy, are the majority of gentiles white and attractive, while the majority of Jews are black and ugly?\u201d - Joseph Ben Nathan Official, 13th Century French-Jew, Le Juif Medieval Au Miroir de L\u2019art Chretien (Paris, 1966), p. 21 It\u2019s so interesting, that my people are given such a hard time in the America\u2019s and all over the world for being \u201cblack and ugly\u201d, and yet this is what was said of the Jews in the 13th Century, by a Jewish controversialist. And these were the Jews of France who fled to Negroland in 1403. But maybe we can find someone who can go into more detail about the black and ugly features of the Jew, because if at all left to any level of open interpretation, people will lie and tell you black doesn\u2019t really mean black, it means white, or refers to a moral defect instead of skin color: \u201cAs I attentively surveyed the Jewish population on the streets of London, I fancied I could perceive three different cast of features: the first Jewish, par excellence, and never to be mistaken; a second, such as Rembrandt drew; and a third, possibly darker, of other races intermingled. It seems to me, indeed, that almost every race shows, as it were, three forms of race which run into each other, connecting them possibly with others, so that this is not peculiar to the Jewish race. Of the first form I need say little to you, begging you merely to recollect that the contour is convex; the eyes long and fine, the outer angles running towards the temples; the brow and nose apt to form a single convex line; the nose comparatively narrow at the base, the eyes consequently approaching each other; lips very full, mouth projecting, chin small, and the whole physiognomy, when swarthy, as it often is, has an African look... If to these be added, as happens in the male face, that certain features display the internal structure, the skeleton of the face, then all beauty flies. A brow marked with furrows or prominent points of bone, or with both; high cheek-bones; a sloping and disproportioned chin; an elongated, projecting mouth, which at the angles threatens every moment to reach the temples; a large, massive, club-shaped, hooked nose, three or four times larger than suits the face\u2014these are features which stamp the African character of the Jew, his muzzle-shaped mouth and face removing him from certain other races, and bringing out strongly with age the two grand deformative qualities\u2014disproportion, and a display of the anatomy. Thus it is that the Jewish face never can, and never is, perfectly beautiful. I of course include not those rare exceptions which at times appear, nor those faces composed of two races which at times approach perfection.\u201d - The Races of Men: A Fragment, Robert Knox, 1850s, pg 197-199 What does par excellence mean? It means the most common of a given sort. The most common of the given sort of Jews in London were \u201cblack and ugly\u201d with an African look. Swarthy, black skin. Prognathism. Large nose. High cheekbones. Full lips. These features belong to us. So why do people lie and say the Jews weren\u2019t Black? These were the same stock of Jews that fled to Negroland from England in 1422. Maybe we\u2019d get a different story if we questioned what the attributes of the Jews from Spain were that were expelled in 1462: \u201c\u2026Thus, the Jews are a people who have ever, according to the prophecy, \u201c dwelt alone,\u201d without intermixing with \u201cthe nations\u201d to this day. Now this separate race, all descended from brown ancestors, (for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob must have been as dark as Mar Yohannan,* if not darker,) exhibit every shade of color, from the black Jews of Malabar, of whom we have such 'an interesting account by Dr. Claudius Buchanan, to the rose and lily complexion of the Jewesses on the banks of the Elbe. We need go no further than the Jews of southern Spain, and compare them with those of Holland and northern Germany, to perceive a very striking difference. The Spanish Jew is always dark-complexioned, and his hair is uniformly black, whilst the German Jew is often as fair as any German, and has light or red hair, with blue eyes. The various shades of color observable among the negro, or African race, tends to the same conclusion.\u201d - A Treatise on Physical Geography: Comprising Hydrology, Geognosy, Geology, Meteorology, Botany, Zoology, and Anthropology, A. Barrington, M.H. Newman, January 1, 1851 I might add that tan or \u201colive\u201d skin is not a striking difference from white skin because this is the type of thing people like to cook up. The Spanish Jews were black, just like all the other Jews recorded in ancient history, but only some of the Spanish Jews actually made it to Negroland. Most of them passed over into Portugal where they were ultimately made slaves and sent to work Portuguese possessions in Africa and the Americas with the papal seal of approval from the Pope of Rome. All the same, those that did make it to Negroland wouldn\u2019t have faired any better because they too were snatched and carted off in the Trans-Atlantic and Trans-Saharan slave trades: \u201cBerissa lies eastward on the Nile(Niger) at the distance of twelve stations from Tocrur; this is a little city, not walled, and seems like a populous village; but the citizens are merchants, trading to all parts, and subjects to the king of Tocrur. To the southward of Berissa, at the distance of ten days' march, lies the land of Lamlam, into which incursions are made by the inhabitants of Berissa, Salla, Tocrur, and Ghana; there they take numbers of captives, whom they carry away to their own countries, and dispose of to the merchants trading thither; these afterwards sell them into all parts of the world. In the whole land of Lamlam there are but two small cities, or as it were villages, and those are Malel and Dau, situated at the distance of four days' journey from each other. Their inhabitants, as people of those parts relate, are Jews, and most of them unbelieving and ignorant.\u201d Historical Account of Discoveries and Travels in Africa, from the Earliest Ages to the Present Time, Including the Substance of the Late Dr. Leyden's Work on that Subject \u2013 Hugh Murray, John Leyden, pg. 527  The inhabitants of Africa took the Jews that were in their land, and sold them to the Arabs and Europeans, who sold them into all parts of the world. The cities of Malel and Dau can be found in the very center of the map above along the Niger river. The numbers of the people stolen in the Trans-Saharan slave trade and other connected slave trades are estimated to have been between 10 to 18 million collectively. The Niger River in Bilad al-Sudan, or Mali, again, was a hotspot for Negro Jews, as shown by the historical records of Jewish kingdoms in West Africa and the migration of Negro Jews into these kingdoms from France, England, Spain and Portugal. The Ashkenazi people of Germany were never sold into worldwide slavery. They were not the Jews of Bilad al-Sudan. They were not the Jews of Lam-Lam. \u201cTo the south of this... there is a Negro people called Lamlam. They are unbelievers. They brand themselves on the face and temples. The people of Ghanah and Takrur invade their country, capture them, and sell them to merchants who transport them to the Maghrib. There, they constitute the ordinary mass of slaves. Beyond them to the south, there is no civilization in the proper sense.\u201d Ibn Khaldun, The Sahara, A Cultural History, pg. 77 The question isn\u2019t, \u201cWhen were the Jews ever regarded as Negroes in history?\u201d, because the Jews were always regarded as Negroes in the eyes of history. It\u2019s, \u201cWhen did it become socially unacceptable to refer to Black people as Jews?\u201d When they had to be reduced to less than human to justify enslaving, raping and murdering them? Because this is what the Babylon of Rome has wrought in the earth: \u201cThe Jews, thus driven from Spain, fled for the most part into Portugal, and obtained from King John, under certain Conditions, that they might live there for a certain Season. The Conditions were chiefly these, That every one should pay to the King eight pieces of gold, and leave Portugal within a limited time, and forfeit their liberty if they exceeded it; and that the king should grant them free liberty to sail away. Whilst the king lived, Bzovius tells us he took great care to perform his promise to the Jews. He commanded his officers in the ports, that they should agree with the Masters of Ships, for transporting the Jews where they pleas\u2019d for a reasonable price; and farther order\u2019d, that no one should injure them. But it happen\u2019d far o herwise: For the Merchants and Masters, who had reciev\u2019d the Jews on board their ships, used them very cruelly at Sea. Not contented with the price they had agreed for, they used all the methods they could invent to extort more from them, and besides this, even forced[that is raped] their Wives and Daughters. These horrible abuses terrifying the Jews that yet remained in Portugal, and not being able through poverty to purchase within the time the necessaries for their voyage, suffer\u2019d it to elapse, and thus lost their liberty; and he who wanted a Jew Servant, begged him of the King. In the meanwhile King John died.\u201d  \u201cHis successor Emanuel, finding that the Jews could not help staying longer in Portugal than the time fixed them by John, gave them all their liberty. Some time after this he was advised by the King and Queen of Castile by Letters, not to suffer that wicked Nation, hated by God and Man, to abide in Portugal. After mature deliberation of the affair, he commanded all the Jews and Moors in Portugal, who would not profess the Christian religion, to depart the kingdom, and set them a day, after which, if any of them were found there, they should forfeit their liberty. The Moors immediately passed over into Africa. And as the Jews were preparing to depart, the King commanded that all their Children, who were not fourteen years old, should be taken from their parents, and educated in the Christian religion. It was a most affecting Thing, to see children snatched from the Embraces of their Mothers, and Fathers embracing their children violently torn from them, and even beat with Clubs, to hear the dreadful Cries they made, and every Place filled with the Lamentations and Yells of Women. Many through indignation threw their sons into pits, and others killed them with their own hands. What added to their misery was, that those who would have gone over to Africa to avoid these Evils , were not suffered; for the King deferred giving them the Liberty of sailing Day after Day. And although at first he assigned them three Ports, where they might go on board, he afterwards forbid their sailing from any other but that of Lisbon. This brought a vast Number of the Jews to that City. But in the mean while the appointed Day was past, so that such of them as could not get off were necessarily made Slaves.\u201d - The history of the inquisition, pgs 128\u2013129, by Limborch, Philippus van, 1633-1712 What did the Portuguese do with their Black Jewish slaves, the same ones that can be seen in the portrait above? What did they do with them? Where did they go? \u201cKing John II. in 1492, expelled all the Jews to the island of St. Thomas, which had been discovered in 1471, and to other Portuguese settlements on the continent of Africa; and from these banished Jews, the Black Portuguese, as they are called, and the Jews in Loango, who are despised by the very Negroes, are descended. By these colonist, St. Thomas soon became a considerable place of trade, and valuable for it\u2019s sugar plantation. Thirty years after their settlement, not less than one hundred and fifty-six thousand arrobes(of thirty pounds weight each) of sugar were exported; and the engines of fifty sugar works, turned by slaves.\u201d - The Critical Review, Or, Annals of Literature, Volumes 57-58 The truth of what the Portuguese did on that island, and what they did with the \u201cBlack Portuguese\u201d, and their brainwashed Roman Catholic children, will make your blood run cold and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. There are writers from that time that refused to put to pen and paper to record in totality the things they witnessed happened. This is the extent of the depravity of the people who have enslaved us and flushed our entire heritage down the drain; that after all the wickedness and evil that they have sown among us, they deny it ever happened, they deny that we were the ones it was done to with the seal of approval from the pope of Rome and call us evil for proving it did, and that we are who we say we are. \u201cA remarkable fact in the history of Loango, in the empire of Congo, is, that the country, according to a statement which was fully credited by Oldendorp, himself a writer of most correct judgment and of unimpeachable veracity, contains many Jews settled in it, who retain their religious rites and the distinct habits which keep them isolated from other nations. Though thus separate from the African population, they are black, and resemble the other Negroes in every respect as to physical character.\u2018 It is probably in allusion to this case that Pennington, in his \u201c Text Book,\u201d says, \u201c the descendants of a colony of Jews, originally from Judea, settled \u2018on the coast of Africa, are black.\u201d - A Tribute for the Negro: Being a Vindication of the Moral, Intellectual, and Religious Capabilities of the Coloured Portion of Mankind; with Particular Reference to the African Race, Wilson Armistead (Books by Wilson Armistead on Google Play), Greenwood, January 1, 1848 That\u2019s right. The Jews of Loango, Angola and the Congo descended from the Portuguese Jews and perhaps the Jews of Bilad al-Sudan resembled the other Negroes in every respect of physical character, just as the Israelites of Egypt resembled the Ethiopians in every respect of physical character. About a quarter of my DNA is estimated to come from the region. This is because almost half of the people enslaved in the entire Trans-Atlantic slave trade came from the Loango coast at over 5,694,000 souls. Loango was a region dominated by the Portuguese. They expelled the Jewish people to the islands of St. Thomas, Principe, Cape Verde and the coast of Loango. They knew exactly where they were going and who they were taking from Loango because those weren\u2019t the first Jews they enslaved: \u201cThe regular shipment of slaves from Africa to European possessions in the Americas began in the early 1500s (although the greatest growth would not take place until the spread of plantation agriculture, especially sugar, after the 1640s). The development of colonial labor needs arose from a combination of the exhaustion of indigenous stores of precious metals by European looting, together with the decimation of the local populations by diseases introduced from Europe. In order to make their colonies pay, the Spanish needed workers to produce goods and people able to resist the diseases that caused such high death rates among the Native Americans and European settlers. The first slaves imported on a regular basis were Africans from Portugal, who had first been converted to Christianity.\u201d - The Portuguese didn\u2019t stop at the Jews and our children in Portugal. They didn\u2019t stop at St. Thomas or any of the isles of the sea. They didn\u2019t stop at Loango. They recorded the Jews in Senegal as well, nearby where Mr. Fadiga and the Bani Israel community are located today. \u201cThe Story of Senegal's Hated, Reclusive 'Jewish' Community Portuguese navigators documenting their voyages around Africa's shores in the 15th century actually reveal how the Europeans saw the world \u2013 and the Jews In the 15th century, the Portuguese began to sail south along the West African coast, searching for the sea route to India. Along the way they landed in all sorts of places along the coast, where they traded with the natives and documented everything they saw. One of these documents, written by an anonymous Portuguese navigator, provides us with a rare glimpse into a very strange phenomenon: A group of \u201cJews\u201d who lived in West Africa, near the Gambia River. \u201cSome of the people here believe in Mohammed, but the majority are idol worshippers,\u201d wrote the nameless Portuguese navigator. \u201cIn this land there are Jews known as \u2018Gauls,\u2019 and they are black like the rest of the inhabitants. But they have no synagogues and do not conduct Jewish ceremonies.\u201d \u201cThey do not live with the other blacks, but separately,\u201d he reported. \u201cBecause they do not dare enter the villages, they locate themselves behind the houses of the ruler of the village and at dawn they sing his praises, until he grants them a portion of millet. And then they go. If they didn\u2019t do so, the rest of the blacks would not tolerate them \u2013 so great is their hatred for them, which forbids them from entering any house except for that of the ruler of the village. If they find them inside the village, they are beaten with sticks.\u201d\u201d - The story of Senegal's hated, reclusive 'Jewish' community The Jews in Senegal lived along The Gambia River correct? \u201cSlaves brought to the United States represented about 3.6 percent of the total number of Africans transported to the New World, or around 388,000 people\u2014considerably less than the number transported to colonies in the Caribbean (including more than 1.2 million to Jamaica alone) or to Brazil (4.8 million). Of those Africans who arrived in the United States, nearly half came from two regions: Senegambia, the area comprising the Senegal and Gambia Rivers and the land between them, or today\u2019s Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Mali; and west-central Africa, including what is now Angola, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon. The Gambia River, running from the Atlantic into Africa, was a key waterway for the slave trade; at its height, about one out of every six West African slaves came from this area.\u201d - What part of Africa did most slaves come from? It\u2019s estimated that over 750,000 souls were enslaved from the Senegambia region, where 15% of my DNA is said to come from if Mali is included. But what about some of the other regions my ancestors were taken from? Where are the Jewish records from the Bight of Benin? \u201cDahomey. East of a Great Popo begins the Dahomey territory, guarded by the important town of Glehweh, known to Europeans by the various names of Fida, Heredah, Whydah, Wida. The old writers called it Juda, and it\u2019s inhabitants were said to be Jews, while the neighboring river Allala, whose real name is Aegean, became the Euphrates. During the flourishing days of the slave trade, from sixteen to eighteen thousand were annually transported from Ajuda, as the Portuguese called this place, which at that time had a population of thirty-five thousand.\u201d -  \u201cWhydah(Fida, Hwedah, Ouida, Juda ou Ajuda) est in\u2019s ville ancienne, fr\u00e9quent\u00e9e depuis le XVI si\u00e8cle par les n\u00e9griers portugais, qui lui donn\u00e8rent don nom. Ses habitants \u00e9taient dits les Juda\u00efques, et on les consid\u00e9rait en effet comme un rests de tribus dispers\u00e9es d\u2019Isra\u00ebl; au Nord, la rivi\u00e8re d\u2019Allala, dont le vrai nom est Efra, \u00e9tait devenue l\u2019Euphrate pour les \u00e9rudits. English Translation: Whydah (Fida, Hwedah, Ouida, Juda or Ajuda) is an ancient city, frequented since the 16th century by Portuguese slave traders, who gave it its name. Its inhabitants were said to be the Judaics, and indeed were considered to be remnants of the scattered tribes of Israel; to the north, the river of Allala, whose real name is Efra, had become the Euphrates for scholars. - Secretariat of the Languedoc Geographical Society, 1890, pg 272 Almost 2,000,000 people were stolen from the Bight of Benin, accounting for 15% of the slaves in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and 5% of my DNA. And what happened during the Trans-Saharan and Trans-Atlantic slave trades that scattered my people into the four corners of the earth? What has been our collective story world-wide? Deuteronomy 28:15-68 King James Version 15 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee: 16 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field. 17 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store. 18 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep. 19 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out. 20 The Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me. 21 The Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it. 22 The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish. 23 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron. 24 The Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed. 25 The Lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. 26 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away. 27 The Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed. 28 The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart: 29 And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee. 30 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof. 31 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them. 32 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand. 33 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway: 34 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 35 The Lord shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head. 36 The Lord shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone. 37 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the Lord shall lead thee. 38 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it. 39 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them. 40 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit. 41 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity. 42 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume. 43 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low. 44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail. 45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee: 46 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever. 47 Because thou servedst not the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things; 48 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the Lord shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee. 49 The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; 50 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young: 51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee. 52 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the Lord thy God hath given thee. 53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee: 54 So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave: 55 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates. 56 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, 57 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. 58 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, The Lord Thy God; 59 Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. 60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. 61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed. 62 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the Lord thy God. 63 And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it. 64 And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone. 65 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: 66 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 67 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 68 And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you. This is our history. This is our story. This is our day to day life. These were our ancestors. This is our culture. This is our pain and our suffering. It\u2019s our struggle. Nobody else fits the combined record of the history, anthropology and genetics of the Jewish people or the prophetic grasp of the Scriptures. We are the Jewish people and we will not give our identity over to another people. It\u2019s undignified. If you want to pretend that the Ashkenazi people are the Jewish people and you want to defend them in spite of all the evidence, you go right ahead. We want everybody to be able to make an informed decision about how they live their lives on Earth, but we won\u2019t try to stop you. Neither will we promote violence or racial hatred against the Ashkenazi people. We must necessarily report what God has said about the people they have stepped into the shoes of in prophecy, which is not good, but at the same time God commands us not to abhor an Edomite or avenge ourselves. We don\u2019t want the world to fawn over us with flatteries spew out dishonest gestures of repentance or universal brotherhood because we already exactly what people think about us. It\u2019s not like people feel the need to hide what they think from us. We don\u2019t want to be tutored and taught by the Ashkenazi people to commit blasphemy and reject our Messiah. We don\u2019t want the world to try to force the Ashkenazi people to let us live in the land of Israel with them or force them out. It\u2019s not time for us to go back to the land of Israel because the God of Israel isn\u2019t finished with us or our sins and he hasn\u2019t returned to set this world straight yet. If Jesus never descends from Heaven with an army angels and resurrected saints to wage war on this world and gather us from every nation we\u2019ve been enslaved and persecuted in, like he has promised, we will never go back to the land of our fathers and this world will never come to an end. So, everybody, continue to enjoy yourselves. We\u2019re just a bunch of crazy cultist anyways right? Isn\u2019t that what everybody says? So just keep doing whatever you\u2019ve been doing. Everybody enjoy themselves. Live it up. Do you. But if you saw all of this evidence with your own eyes, and from the bottom of your heart you believe in the God of Israel, and you fear the God of Israel for all that he has caused to come to pass upon us, then you turn to him and put your trust in him alone, and read the Bible for yourself and stop letting people tell you what it says, because I guarantee you that there are religious people out here lying to you. And that\u2019s for anybody, of any race or nationality. The Lost Sheep of the House of Israel come first to me and God, but the God of Israel is not a racist and neither am I. It\u2019s his hearts desire that as many of his creation that can be saved be saved. And if there\u2019s a Hebrew Israelite that\u2019s been telling you that other races of people can\u2019t be saved because of the color of their skin then that\u2019s one of the people that I guaranteed you have been lying to you. That\u2019s not who we are, that\u2019s not what we represent. That\u2019s what people want us to represent because it\u2019s the easiest way to make excuses to avoid coming clean before the God of Israel but God is not stupid. He knows who hates him and he knows who loves him. People can manufacture all the lies and excuses they want but it will never change the reality the God judges everyone, without exception, not according to their race, but according to their works. If God was a racist, he would have never thrown my people headfirst into the carnage and hell of slavery because the racist judges I know in America acquit their own people of every crime they commit or give them a slap on the wrist. But that\u2019s not what God has done to us, is it? Look around at my people. Look at our condition. Look at our \u201cshithole\u201d countries. Look at what we\u2019ve been through Look at our men. Look at our women. Look at our children. All of this is the result of our sins. Hebrew Israelites admit it. Hebrew Israelites would change it all but our people don\u2019t want to change. Our people like living like this. Our people love sin. We\u2019re the same people today as we were two thousand years ago. But if we were racist, we would never admit it, because all the racist I know of in the U.S. of A hold themselves and all their people guiltless at all times, every single one of them. But everybody has a problem with Hebrew Israelites warning all people of all nations of God\u2019s wrath if they don\u2019t turn things around. I guarantee you, God is your real problem: Jeremiah 25 King James Version 25 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 2 The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 3 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the Lordhath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened. 4 And the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear. 5 They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the Lord hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever: 6 And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt. 7 Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the Lord; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt. 8 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words, 9 Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the Lord, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations. 10 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle. 11 And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 12 And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the Lord, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations. 13 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations. 14 For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands. 15 For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. 16 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them. 17 Then took I the cup at the Lord's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the Lord had sent me: 18 To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day; 19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; 20 And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod, 21 Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon, 22 And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea, 23 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners, 24 And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert, 25 And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes, 26 And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them. 27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you. 28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink. 29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. 30 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. 31 A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. 32 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. 33 And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. 34 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. 35 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. 36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture. 37 And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the Lord. 38 He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.
