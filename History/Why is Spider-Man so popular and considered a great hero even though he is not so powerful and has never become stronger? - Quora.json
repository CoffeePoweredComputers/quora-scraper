            "answer_text": "People say that Spider Man is a popular hero because he\u2019s relatable, and he is a well-rounded hero who is a strong street level hero, but not an overpowering force of nature like the Hulk, Thor, or even Iron Man. However, I am going on a different reason why Spider Man is a great hero, and it\u2019s because the guy is Nice. If you look at Bruce Wayne as a person, yeah he seems nice but he\u2019s kind of a jerk unless you\u2019re close to him. Clark Kent\u2019s a nice guy, but he comes off as wimpy a bit and a little bit boring. Peter Parker? The guy\u2019s the perfect blend of Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent. He is a really nice guy, but he can stand up for himself. That detective was deadset on arresting Daredevil, but one pep talk from Spider Man, the guy became Daredevil\u2019s ally.   I can not stress enough, how important Spider Man is in the Marvel Universe. He is the most profitable Marvel hero of all time for a reason, and it\u2019s because Spider Man is the nicest hero in the Marvel Universe. I am not joking. The guy has a charming, laid-back, charismatic personality that makes you relax and want to hang out with the guy. He is one of the few people who Wolverine actually considers a friend, and invites him to his birthday.   In a Daredevil run, Spider Man actually convinces Daredevil to goof off and have some fun. If you know Daredevil, he is even more brooding and moodier than Batman.   In the event Absolute Carnage, Eddie Brock has the option to either get Captain America, Wolverine, and the Thing as backup against the Symbiote Army. But he chooses Spider Man because he\u2019s the only hero Eddie Brock trusts.  The point I am making is that Spider Man is the nicest superhero in the Marvel Universe, which is why he is so popular in the comics, and even in real life. Every superhero in Marvel may not have interacted with Captain America, but I gurantee that every single superhero in Marvel has had an adventure or partnered with Spider Man. It got to the point where super heroes would compare Spider Man and Captain America, saying that Spider Man will be the Captain America of the next generation.  And honestly, I can see that. There\u2019s a reason why civilians and fellow heroes think Spider Man would be the next great thing.  The main difference, is that Captain America is a great leader who can rally his troops together. But he isn\u2019t relatable, you really can\u2019t connect and talk to him. He is inspiring and more respectable, but not easy to talk to. But Spider Man is the glue that holds the team together, he is the person that keeps morale high and helps the team win the battle. He is really relatable (you can talk to him about anything) and a really sweet person. There\u2019s a reason why Cable, a guy from the future, says that Spider Man will be the Greatest Hero of all time.  Captain America wanted to create a new Avengers team, but he said that Captain America would only join the new Avengers team is if Spider Man also joined.  Thor calls Spider Man the most Midgardian Mortal.  All these legendary heroes respect Spider Man (even though he\u2019s younger than all of them) because Spider Man is the nicest person, and is the glue that holds the team together. There\u2019s a reason that when Spider Man plays a major part in the crossovers, the crossovers automatically get great scores. In conclusion, Spider Man is popular around the original and the current generation because he\u2019s the nicest person who helps bring up morale and support. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the impression that Spider-Man is \u201cnot so powerful\u201d is quite mistaken. In Captain America Civil War alone we see him catch a car traveling 40 MPH which is the equivalent of something like 20,000 pounds. We also see him catch a punch thrown by Winter Soldier with his bionic arm with seemingly little effort while later -though not exactly the same circumstance- in the movie Iron Man is knocked backwards into a wall by a similar punch. Most tellingly however, Spider-Man not only holds up a 60,000 pound jet bridge for several seconds while talking to Captain America, but catches the jet bridge while falling which is an impact of over 15,000,000 pounds of force - the equivalent to 20 cars being dropped on you all at once. So physically it would seem Spider-Man is much closer to (I\u2019m not saying as strong as) Hulk and Thor level strength than he is to Captain America. That strength is coupled with reflexes as fast or faster than any other MCU hero except Pietro who is no longer alive. When not distracted he can dodge or react to situations at least as quickly as Loki did in catching Hawkeye\u2019s arrow in the first Avengers movie. This ability is multiplied by his spider-sense which can alert him to threats and prompt his to react before he is consciously aware of them. We haven\u2019t yet seen the limits of his reflexes but in the comics he can dodge automatic gunfire - he\u2019s not faster than a bullet but fast, agile, and aware enough to not be where the shooter is aiming. Another important, and often overlooked, aspect to his abilities is having \u201csticky\u201d feet and hands. This not only lets him climb walls but also allows him to absorb impacts without moving - demonstrated by catching a moving car or a Winter Soldier punch without being knocked backwards or off his feet. This means he is counter-punching or otherwise reacting while other heroes are still picking themselves up off the ground twenty feet away. Throw in his leaping, wall climbing, webs and web-swinging and you have a hero who with no training or experience who can take down two powerful \u201csuper\u201d foes at once. As I\u2019ve said before on Quora, Captain America is super-human, his abilities outclass any unaltered human but not necessarily every animal - his strength is often depicted as around that of a strong elephant, his top speed about like a cheetah\u2019s (though with much greater endurance) for example. Spider-Man, on the other hand, is super-natural - his abilities are beyond those of any natural life form on earth. ",
