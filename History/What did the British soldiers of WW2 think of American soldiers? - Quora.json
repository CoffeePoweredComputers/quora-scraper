            "answer_text": "Cocky, arrogant, uncouth,and barely housebroken. They agreed that the American Soldier was well equipped, and enthusiastic (and a more than a bit naive). However, they were sloppy and undisciplined. Many of the higher enlisted ranks and especially the officers, found the informality of the average American soldier to be unprofessional (the Germans had a real problem with this). After our first series of engagements with the Germans in North Africa, there was a sense of American comeuppance by their British counterparts; the Germans weren\u2019t going to quite as easy to defeat as many GIs and military brass had thought. Some British officers thought that the Americans lacked the will to fight. There was a renewed consideration of allowing US troops to operate under British command, which was quite naturally rejected out of hand. Once American troops got their footing under them, I think the British were pleasantly surprised at the fighting capability of the average GI. I don\u2019t know if they were all that impressed by many of the American senior officers. There was without a doubt a lot of personalities clashes (more than just Montgomery and Patton), but that was to be expected given the egos involved. The British were impressed by US military equipment, and especially the quality and quantity. In the end, I think the American \u201cGI\u201d and the British \u201cTommy\u201d got on well, although privately, I think each was happy to see the go. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember my father, a North African veteran from 1939 - 1943, Europe thereafter, telling me about conversations he had with German POWs . Question, what do you think of the Americans? Answer - what do you think of the Italians? I assume that this encounter was as a result of the battle of the Kasserine pass where he was convinced that the Brits and Allies had saved the US forces. No judgement from me here, just from what he said about his experience. I have already posted about US troops- they learned and learned well - they were green at Kasserene - plus my post about about Italian troops. I wish I had asked him more - but like many veterans he spoke little. All I can say - he did not criticsise the \u201cYanks\u201d in Europe. I once asked him about the portrayal of US troops in Europe in films. He confirmed, as in many films, they sang marching towards the battle front. \u201cThey did not sing coming back\u201d. ",
