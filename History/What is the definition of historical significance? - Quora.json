            "answer_text": "Very simply put. Something of historical significance is anything that had a bearing on the situation at the period of time it took place. For example, gun powder being used in a cannon for the first time changed history. so its significance was real. Another example was at the battle of Hastings 1066 the English cavalry could not use their lances at full speed as they had no way of staying on the horse when contacting the enemy. The reason..Their didnt have stirrups to help support them in the saddle. The Normans did have them. They were invented by the Mongols and slowly spread across Europe. So stirrups were of historical significance at Hasting..They helped win the battle. ",

            "answer_text": "Something that brings so much attention to itself that it is unavoidable not to notice. Something that caused such a great change in e.g. society, the environment, that we go back and question what made this change. From the view of a single person, anything we have created that lasts beyond our lifetime is historically significant: ChildrenAn inventionAn ideaA legacyPerhaps defining what significant means to us is the real answer to the question.
