            "answer_text": "1- Bhishma oath- This oath started all this. Had he not taken that oath he could have always taken the decision that should have been taken. His oath made him so weak that he could not stand up for his kulvadhu when she was being disrobed. 2 - Pandu getting cursed - If Pandu was not cursed, he would not have asked Kunti to incite the Gods and his sons would not have been that strong. A normal human could not have given birth to Dharma raj and may be then Duryodhan would have deemed worthier than Yudhistra. A normal human being could not have fathered mighty Bhimsen, and valorous Arjuna. 3 - Drona becoming the perceptor of Kuru Rajkumar's - Had he not been a perceptor of Kuru Rajkumar, he would not have sent rajkumar's to defeat Drupad. If Pandavas would not have defeated Drupad, he would not have felt humiliated and he would not have done a Yagya to get a prince in which he also got Draupadi, who ultimately became the wife of the Pandavas. 4 - Laksha Graha - It was the first step which paved the path to the war. It depicted how flawed the Kuru family was now and the throne would not be easy for Yudhistra so the pandavas must prepare accordingly 5 - Draupadi becoming the wife of all Pandavas - Arjun won Draupadi and Drupad also wanted his daughter to wed Arjun. Now if Draupadi had been the wife of only Arjun then Yudhistra would not have staked her. 6 - Dice Game - This includes all the events. Dice game, Yudhistra staking his brothers, and then himself and then Draupadi. And then Draupadi's disrobe. This filled the the rage in the mind and heart of all the Parthas. This engulfed the gap between Kauravas and the Pandavas. This was the biggest reason of the war. 7 - Draupadi kidnapped by Jaydrath - Jaydrath abducting Draupadi was next major incident. This incident led to humiliation of Jayadrath which encouraged him to do penance and get the boon from Shiva to defeat 4 Pandavas for one full day. This boon ensured the killing of Abhimanyu which ultimately was the reason for Arjun to stop fighting lightly and stop caring for the Adharmis relative. Abhimanyu killing also led the gates open for unethical ways to kill and stop following the war rules. 8 - Virat war - Virat war was the final warning to Duryodhana that there is no way he can defeat Pandavas, that he must make peace as when all his great warriors along with their army could not defeat even Arjun then how can they defeat all 5 pandavas and their army. Duryodhana's pride Karna was defeated 3 times in that war by Arjun. And it should have been an eye opener. 9 - Killing of Bhishma and Drona was the next signifacant event. These two death had morally affected the Kauravas and by the death of Drona the picture was almost clear. It was now just the matter of time that how long the Kauravas can delay the war. I am not adding Karna Vadh here because by then Kauravas were almost defeated. Karna was the only warrior they had now. Bhishma, Drona, jayadrath, dushashan, 99 brothers of Duryodhana and most others were dead by now. 10 - Ashwatthama's madness - Ashwatthama's madness gave the lesson that war is never in anyones favour. All the Panchalas were dead, all Pandavas son who should have been the successors to the Pandavas and the King to the whole country were also dead. Even Arjun's grandson was dead though revived later by Krishna. Pandavas won their kingdom, but for whom? All their sons were dead. Their in laws, the Panchalas were dead. So it gave the message, follow Dharma, and live with peace, wars are always disastrous. ",
