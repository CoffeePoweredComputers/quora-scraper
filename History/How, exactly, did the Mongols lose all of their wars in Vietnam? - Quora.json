            "answer_text": "Question: How, exactly, did the Mongols lose all of their wars in Vietnam? Answer: I think that to answer How exactly Mongolia Empire (1) was defeated till three times in Vietnam is hard and complicated. However, I shall try to sum up some key factors that contributed to the victories of the Vietnamese against the Mongolian forces. First and foremost, the Vietnamese is always the key factor for all their victory. Of course, I shall not debate about how tough the Vietnamese are when fighting against their enemy, especially their invaders. Because this is the obvious truth that they were born to be warriors fighting to the death to protect their fatherland. I am going to only emphasize on the reasonable tactic that led the Vietnamese to their victories in the war against Mongolia.  Some may not know that the Vietnamese have the proverb \u201cBi\u1ebft ng\u01b0\u1eddi bi\u1ebft ta tr\u0103m tr\u1eadn tr\u0103m th\u1eafng\u201d, translated into English, perhaps, \u201cTo know oneself is true progress\u201d. It means that if you know yourself and your enemy, you could meet the most success in battles. For the Vietnamese, after many small conflicts and losing battle before Mongolia, they know that the Mongolian force had the three points which create their strength. However, these also are three weak points that lead them to defeat in Vietnam. The Mongolian cavalries were strong but they also depended much on their horses and cavalries.The Mongolian expeditionary forces often did not depend much on their logistics and food from their home. It means that they only carried a little food for themselves and primarily rob from cities, villages\u2026etc where they seized or went through. Their food sources depended on their enemy, the Vietnamese.The Mongolian forces always wanted to use the tactic \u2018Fast fight and fast win\u201d as they fight against the Song dynasty,\u2026etc but the Vietnamese did not allow them this chance. In reality, America also wished the Vietnamese to fight a full-scale war like WW2 or the Korean war during the Vietnam War but the Vietnamese also said No like they did to Mongolia.Now, What the tactic that Vietnamese used to limit the strength of Mongolia and defeat them. Firstly, the Vietnamese also use the tactic similar to the guerrilla tactic. The tropical jungles are things that most of the people often think about Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The Vietnamese also used guerilla tactics on their jungles to defeat America. But you may be wrong with the Mongolian case. In reality, the Vietnamese took advantage of the complex river system that connected like spiderwebs on North Vietnam, especially on the Red River delta to limit the Mongolia cavalry\u2019s strength and gained the decisive victories such as Bach Dang battle, Ham Tu-Tay Ket battle, the Van Kiep Battle, the Dong Bo Dau battle.  The Vietnamese chose to fight against the Mongolian expeditionary forces on their river systems. They could easily fight against Mongolia and run away along with their rivers during their war against Mongolia as well as, live every year on their small boats like this image:   There is nothing for the Mongolian cavalries to fight on this kind of terrain in Vietnam. I shall call temporarily this tactic is \u201cRiver Guerrilla\u201d. Secondly, Vietnam used the tactic \u201cV\u01b0\u1eddn Kh\u00f4ng Nh\u00e0 Tr\u1ed1ng\u201d, perhaps, translated into English \u2018Vacated or evacuated houses, abandoned (or uncultivated) gardens\u201d. It means that the Vietnamese destroyed all necessary things including their home, their crop if they could not move, leave nothing for their enemy - the Mongolia.  There are no animals, no crop for their enemy where they could not protect.  Seemingly, they tried to stop all food sources for their enemy as much as possible, even some tactics that could harm themselves including destroying their home, their crop, putting the toxic into water. With this tradition, all things for battle, during the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese were always ready to destroy their home to fix the road after the American bombing campaigns for the cars that provided food and others to the battlefield in the South during the Vietnam war. Thirdly, Like what happened to America, the Vietnamese always chose when and where to fight against Mongolia. They shall never fight when they could not have enough soldiers and not afford to win. But the truth is that the Vietnamese marines and naval force were far better than their enemy - the Mongolian navy. Because most of the Vietnamese at that time lived and grew up with the water environment.  They still used the tactic \u201cHit and run\u201d but they ran away by their boat because they could not run faster than the Mongolian horse but could swim faster. In conclusion: The unity and determination of the Vietnamese, as well as the reasonable tactics to limit their enemy\u2019s strength and attack their enemy\u2019s weakness is the key factor decided Why and How the Vietnamese defeated Mongolia like they did to America.  (Bach Dang battle 1288 (2) Especially, during the darkest time of the Vietnam history, they always have the legendary generals that helped them to their victories. Under the Tran Dynasty, The Great General. Tran Hung Dao (3), the General. Pham Ngu Lao (4) who led the Vietnamese forces to defeat MongoliaUnder the Independence war, the Great General Vo Nguyen Giap, Mr. Ho Chi Minh who led the Vietnamese to their victories against France, America, China.The outside factors such as climate, terrain, tropical diseases also contributed much to the victories of the Vietnamese. But these were always not the key factor for their victories. You should know that there were still all outside factors above, Vietnam was still defeated by the Ming Empire in the 15th century (5) only because the Vietnamese were divided under the Dynasty Ho (6).  These tactics above sound like very simple but to defeat the Mongolia Empire, it required much the unity, determination, and sacrifice of the Vietnamese as they did during their wars against Japan, France, America, China during the 20 century. P/s: I write answers based upon the gist and requirement of the question. Readers are requested to read it with neutrality and rational approach. I throughout this answer has no intention of showing any disrespect towards any group of people or country. All Bests Lusia Millar.

            "answer_text": "Guerilla tactics,its very hard to defend if you dont know where the enemies are when they just hit and run You cannot defeat an enemy that doesn\u2019t want to surrender and submit Vietnam was really against ousiders, and can just vanish in the jungle due to how well they know the surroundings The Mongols bring along very little food and gets their food from nearby enemy villages but with Vietnam doing their total warfare retreating all people and burning everything that they left behind left Mongols with little to no food. The hot and humid weather in Vietnam also contributed greatly into weakening the Mongols army creating lots of illness. Vietnam also had a pretty strong navy that is superior then the Mongols which harrassed them alot and was a deciding factor in few major battles Lastly and the most imporant reason was that Mongol\u2019s army was mostly based on mounted archers and heavy calavry to defeat their enemies. They wernt that good on foot Large cavalry maneuvers that required flat plains for horses to run on, which is why they were able to conquer the eurasian steppes and iranian plateau with such ease but were unsuccessful and had to stop whenever they were met by a densely forested area, mountains, or the sea where horses have trouble with Vietnam had lots of trees,jungle and uneven terrains that made it hard for the Mongols  ",
