            "answer_text": "To challenge our existing beliefs I love history. Mostly because I get to have interesting debates about it. We can learn a lot of things from history. Perhaps the most important one is the ability to move on and not repeat our mistakes for no reason. The Anne Frank Diaries were a essential part of my history education growing up, my mom read them when she was a teen growing up in the 90s not long after the father passed away. If we don\u2019t study history, how will we know about our ancestors? I\u2019ve always been fascinated by family history personally. This forms the bulk of our history lessons but we do cover other topics from time to time. Everywhere you go, you will encounter history. We are what our memories are. In other words, history shapes who we are. Wars and conflicts are a important part of world history. History does not have to be dull, there are methods of spicing up the subject. Why history is essential Finally, history can teach students many useful skills that can help them in their chosen fields and in their general lives. These skills include: Reading. Specifically, reading from different time periods. We didn't always talk this way, you know. Opening your mind to new uses of language can be a good skill, both in learning foreign languages and for those law students who seem to study archaic versions of wording sentences so that no one can understand them. It makes you a well rounded soul.Writing. Specifically, good writing. How to not just repeat what someone else said, but to analyze information from multiple sources and come up with your own original conclusions.Being able to form your own opinions and effectively argue those opinions with others. Anyone can say \"yes\" or \"no.\" Most people can't answer \"why.\" For example, anyone can say that aliens have visited Earth before. However, where's the proof? And could that \"proof\" point to other conclusions? How do we know for sure.Research. In history class, you will learn about primary and secondary sources. You will learn how to determine whether a source is reliable or not, as well as how to find sources within other sources.Quantitative analysis. Yes, history has numbers. There are not many historians out there who will cheerfully admit to it, but spreadsheets help us in analyzing data as much as they help economists. We look for patterns in population, in desertions during war, and in environmental factors, to name a few. These patterns help us to find out why things happened. So yes, there are numbers.Qualitative analysis. How do we know that the \"facts\" of history are facts? Could they just be someone's opinion? If so, how do we find the facts? Where do we find them? Are they reliable or not?Taking life with a grain of salt. When you combine the above skills, you learn that not everything is as it seems. History is written by the victors, so history class will teach you that what the textbook says, and what really happened, could be two drastically different things. Or we may never know, and you have to accept that. It teaches you to look at both sides of the coin, and to dig deep past the obvious version of a story too.In summing up, history is fun! Embrace it, you will be definitely be surprised at you can uncover and unearth from investigating the past. That much is guaranteed. ",

            "answer_text": "Why should we learn history? History is a way for us to peer back in time. By doing so we can learn a lot about ourselves. We can assess our growth and potential as human beings. We can also see where we went wrong. You mention wars and conflicts in your description, and I was just thinking about this the other day. I look back at the start of human civilization, and the one thing that stands out more than anything else is the violence perpetrated by humans on other humans. Wars and conflicts often are the result of fighting for resources, but there are other reasons. Religion has played a significant role in humans fighting against one another. One group is determined to convert the rest of the world to their religion. They might try a more democratic approach in the beginning, but when that doesn\u2019t work they use violence. Aside from religion, you also have ideologies that promote war and genocide. Hitler viewed the Jews a lesser human class. He blamed them for the economic issues in Germany at the time and for Germany losing the first world war. The Nazi Regime also believed that there was one master race, the Aryans, and that they were responsible for eliminating the impure. A part of that purification process involved exterminating the Jews and various other groups. Has anything changed in regards to conflict? Maybe. I\u2019m not completely convinced though. The main difference between conflicts in the past and conflicts happening now is that the weapons have changed. For one, we have weapons now that can completely wipe out every living creature on this planet in a very short time. The stakes are higher. What I\u2019ve learned from history is that humanity seems to be compelled to self-destruct. We haven\u2019t learned anything. There is still oppression. There are still tyrants. People are gullible and will believe just about anything. The collective human mind is wholly irrational. The majority of the planet believes in god, despite there being no evidence that a god exists. They have faith in a set of scriptures written by humans, believing them to be the word of god. Some of these same people will deny the facts presented by science. Ignorance rules the world, and as long as it does there will be conflict. ",
