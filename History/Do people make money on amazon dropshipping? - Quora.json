            "answer_text": "Well in essence dropshipping means selling directly from manufacturer to the final customer through an inexpensive middleman (in this case Amazon website) So if it was that easy why didn\u2019t everyone did it well the short answer is the bullwhip effectWhat\u2019s the bullwhip effect you ask, the more you get closer to the final consumer the more stable the demand for the product and therefore the price (which is determined through supply and demand) and the more you get to raw material extraction from the commodity supplier the more volatile is the demand and therefore the more the risk of products being unsold and drop in price So let me give you an example you drive your Toyota Corolla (or any other car of your choice) to the local gas station when your car runs out of gas in order to fill it up, you go at least once every two or three weeks to get gasoline to drive your car therefore your final demand is pretty stable and predictable this is also known as the downstream or the front door, meanwhile companies that roam the deserts of Texas and Ghawar to dig up oil take huge risks as oil may not be there this is called the up stream or the backdoor, you get it now? So when Jeff Bezos started Amazon he firstly listed 20 most used items in a paper and started imagining scenarios to what best to be sold and he finally chose books as there are different book more than anyone on earth can ever imagine even if it had never been published or banned he was shocked by how much books he sold in the first month and Amazon was an instant success So how to profit from dropshipping you ask?-Find your niche: not all people are the same so as tastes if you are gonna target the women\u2019s market to sell beauty products you have to first give women what they actually want and have a very basic understanding of how they choose their products. -Know marketing: know how to market your product, marketing is both a science and an art you should understand basic concepts and consumer psychology -Try to set orders more largely and less frequently: this is pretty critical the more volume you ship the more economies of scale you gain and the lesser the shipping costs and this can actually save your logistical costs substantially -Try to get help and up votes from family and friends: this is another very important point Amazon works via an algorithm that puts famous products first depending on reviews and your past google searches try to convince your family and beloved ones to up vote your product or leave a positive review trust me your sales will go up massively Last but not least be a man of your word if you promised to ship a product tomorrow you have to ship it tomorrow the consumer is so smart and doesn\u2019t like to be cheated and if you make goods that are made in Taiwan you actually have to make sure they are made in Taiwan ",

You'll be wasting your time and money and find it as another one of those scams that simply don't work. If you're looking to make money using Amazon, instead look into Arbitrage. 86% of Amazon sales are due to Amazon Prime. Dropshipping, you'll get the left overs and that's if you get them. You'll be doing a rat race with prices trying to sell things. Drop shipping is not worth it. Look into FBA and Online Arbitrage. That's where the money is at. Let me know if you need any help getting started, ect. ",

However, with Amazon I recommend sending your products to an Amazon warehouse and participate in the Amazon FBA program (let Amazon fulfill all your items). Requires a small upfront investment but its way cheaper and especially FASTER. I sell on Amazon as well but I never dropshipped there. I also heard from multiple people that Amazon highly dislikes dropshipping on their platform (never checked it myself though). ",

Amazon has the potential to bring a ton of traffic BUT it\u2019s a marketplace and you are therefore listed alongside everyone else many of whom are selling products at a loss (loss leader) or breakeven. This makes it so difficult to compete . If you want to succeed in dropshipping, you really need your own store and traffic strategies.  ",

Use mailing lists, remarketing, landing pages to succeed! Check out Erza Firestone\u2019s courses if you\u2019re new to these strategies. Also, if you have more capital, think about white label.
