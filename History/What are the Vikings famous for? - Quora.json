            "answer_text": "Vikings are famous for rape, pillage, and destruction. They picked soft targets and got quite rich raiding them. OK, wait, you may say, but I heard that Vikings had extensive trade networks, they settled large swats of Europe. That Normans, Franks, Rus, and many others were Vikings? Ahh yes, you are right, you heard correctly. Here is the thing though. Those were Vikings, those were Norseman (Northern Man, i.e. modern Norway/Sweden/Dutch). Viking is a generic term that means? Raider. I.E. those Norseman who went on raiding were Vikings, these who didn\u2019t, even those who fought wars were NOT Vikings. It isn\u2019t a little distinction either, but it can be blurry. For instance Vikings did in fact carry lots of Slaves and then sold them in the Middle East. So did Norseman. I.E. Vikings brought slaves, then once they technically weren\u2019t Vikings anymore (i.e. no longer on a Raid) they went to those markets. Today, unfortunately both terms are synonymous with one another, which is a shame as Norseman are one of the most important people in European history. They account for formation of many nations, or for their development. Some of these nations are:Russia: Rus were Vikings and they help build up the region that eventually became Russia, i.e. Land of the Rus Britain: They had multiple influences here. They were the enemies that help galvanize the country. They were reason for Danelaw, i.e. a region where Dane influence was predominate. Ultimately Norseman were Norseman, and they conquered Britain. France: Franc were Germanic tribes, so not technically Norseman, but much of Northern France were Norseman. So yeah, important people. Good to learn about them. ",

            "answer_text": "One thing they are famous for is wearing horned helmets. There is no evidence to support this, and it is not practical. People are starting to get the message but it is still a fairly common misconception. They are also famous for berserkers who are some of the most misunderstood people in history. Here is a good video on that  Vikings are also of course famous for using axes. It isn\u2019t wrong to associate them with axes but their most used weapon was the spear while their secondary weapons were axes. Some vikings known as the huscarls a warrior elite used the dane axe which is probably why Vikings are famous for using them. It was something unique to the Vikings, and other kingdoms which were influenced by them like the Anglo Saxons who called them housecarls.   They are also famous for their longships. They only took on a bit of water so they weren\u2019t so great for sea travel over long distances in deep oceans as that technology was not developed, but they could travel in very shallow waters up rivers.  Vikings were also famous for their excellent metallurgy. For their time, their steel was very advanced. Finally, they are famous for raiding, raping, etc. Anyone who has the traits blonde hair, and or blue eyes has some relation to Scandanavian people. I am not saying it was all the Vikings obviously blonde-haired people existed before the Vikings in many parts of Europe but not quite as many as you find now. Vikings were very mobile rarely seeking pitched battles instead attacking easy targets that gave them the best profits like monestaries. Later, organized military actions would be conducted for example against the city of Paris, you would see invasions of Anglo Saxon Britain, and things like this but most of what they did was quick raiding. Some Vikings including notable rulers actually served in the Byzantine Varangian guard as mercenaries as one could earn quite a bit of prestige working for them, and it paid well. ",
