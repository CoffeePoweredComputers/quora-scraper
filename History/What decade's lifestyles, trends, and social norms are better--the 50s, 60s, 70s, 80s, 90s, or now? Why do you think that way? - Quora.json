You could buy dependable used cars at very low prices and the cost of gasoline was very low. The cost of housing and groceries and most things were so much lower. The wages were much lower but you could buy a lot more for your dollar spent back then. The music scene was filled with new artists bringing new songs daily. The quality of music was so much better back then. It was a great time to be alive. ",
