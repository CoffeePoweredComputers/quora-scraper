            "answer_text": "A book seemingly consisting of five collections of sacred songs\u2014(1) Ps 1-41; (2) 42-72; (3) 73-89; (4) 90-106; (5) 107-150\u2014each collection ending with a blessing pronounced on Jehovah. According to their place in the book, the individual psalms were evidently known by number from ancient times. For example, what is now called \u201cthe second psalm\u201d was also designated as such in the first century C.E.\u2014Ac 13:33. Style. The poetry of the book of Psalms consists of parallel thoughts or expressions. (See HEBREW, II [Hebrew Poetry].) Distinctive are the acrostic, or alphabetic, psalms. (Ps 9, 10, 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, 145) In these psalms the initial verse or verses of the first stanza begin with the Hebrew letter \u02bca\u02b9leph, the next verse(s) with behth, and so on through all or nearly all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This arrangement may have served as a memory aid. For the terminology found in the book of Psalms, see ALAMOTH; ASCENTS; GITTITH; HIGGAION; MAHALATH, II; MASKIL; MIKTAM; MUTH-LABBEN; NEHILOTH; SELAH; SHEMINITH. Writers. Of the 150 psalms, the superscriptions attribute 73 to David, 11 to the sons of Korah (one of these [Ps 88] also mentioning Heman), 12 to Asaph (evidently denoting the house of Asaph; see ASAPH No. 1), one to Moses, one to Solomon, and one to Ethan the Ezrahite. Additionally, Psalm 72 is \u201cregarding Solomon\u201d and apparently was written by David. (See Ps 72:20.) From Acts 4:25 and Hebrews 4:7 it is evident that Psalms 2 and 95 were written by David. Psalms 10, 43, 71, and 91 appear to be continuations of Psalms 9, 42, 70, and 90 respectively. Therefore, Psalms 10 and 71 may be attributed to David, Psalm 43 to the sons of Korah, and Psalm 91 to Moses. There are indications that Psalm 119 may have been written by young prince Hezekiah. (Note Ps 119:9, 10, 23, 46, 99, 100.) This leaves over 40 psalms without a specific composer named or indicated. The individual psalms were written over a period of about 1,000 years, from the time of Moses until after the return from Babylonian exile.\u2014Ps 90:Sup; 126:1, 2; 137:1, 8. The subjects of the song are varied. Most are songs of praises to Jehovah, others are prayers, supplication, requests, appreciation etc. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the book of Psalms about in the Bible? The only way you can truly answer that question is by reading through Psalms repeatedly at a rate of 22 Psalms per day, which is all 151 Psalms in one week for many weeks\u2026 at least for 13 weeks or 3 months. What you will discover eventually is that the Five books of Psalms are a sung response to the Five books of Moses. This is not a one-to-one correspondence, it is a more random correspondence: Book One of Psalms does not correspond exactly to Book One of Moses\u2026 nor does Book Two does not = Book Two, Book Three not = Book Three, Book Four not = Book Four, Book Five not = Book Five. The Psalms more closely follow the application of Torah to kingdom events, laid out in kingdom stages or developments: but, that is not exact either. So, you will discover that Psalms provides a theological summary overview of the entire Old Testament. You will also be surprised to learn that Psalms provides a summary preview of the entire New Testament. The more you see Jesus Christ as the great singer of the Psalms, the more you will see of Jesus Christ in the entire Old Testament. Eventually, you will be able to see how the whole Bible, all 80 books, fits together in a single picture. The Psalms are about Jesus Christ. Be well! ",
