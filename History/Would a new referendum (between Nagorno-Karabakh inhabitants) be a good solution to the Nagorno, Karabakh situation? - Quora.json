            "answer_text": "That\u2019s not the current issue, it\u2019s the ethnic cleansing and additional territories Let\u2019s start with map, note the shaded territories referred to as \u201cArmenian-controlled territories\u201d.  Confused? Nagorno-Karabakh is some distance away from Armenia as you can see in the map above (Nagorno-Karabakh is solid red, Armenia is light red). As a result of this distance during the first war, Armenian forces occupied Azeri lands that were not part of Nagorno-Karabakh. You see this in the map above in the shaded areas. For the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll call that land \u201cthe buffer zone\u201d. Again, the buffer zone is not part of Nagorno-Karabakh nor does Armenia or Artsakh (the Armenian state in Nagorno-Karabakh) claim it to be. However it\u2019s still occupied by Armenian forces and: Those very same Armenian forces ethnically cleansed 800,000 Azeris from that region Without Russian Aid to Armenia, Azerbaijan Has the Upper Hand in Nagorno-Karabakh So this isn\u2019t something that happened in 1850 or 1940. This happened in the 1990s. Many of those 800,000 refugees are still alive and have children.  Abandoned village in the buffer zone Which brings us to a main sticking point that people ignore but Azerbaijan hasn\u2019t: The possible \u201cIsraelization\u201d of the region \u201cWhatever the Azerbaijanis call it, whatever the Minsk Group calls it, we call it our homeland,\u201d said Mkhitaryan from the resettlement and migration department. She said Armenians resent outsiders' lecturing on the territories, and compared Armenia to Israel: a bulwark of Western values on the edge of the Muslim world. \u201cIn my opinion, a soldier [guarding the Nagorno-Karabakh de facto border] defends not only Armenia, not only Artsakh,\u201d she said. \u201cHe also defends Great Britain, America, Europe, Greece. Everyone who understands that under a burqa could be a bomb.\u201d For Armenians, they're not occupied territories \u2013 they're the homeland Many Armenians believe that it\u2019s possible for Armenia to end up becoming a new \u201cIsrael\u201d in the Caucausus region and as a result acquire Western support for annexing the buffer zone. Azerbaijan has regularly accused Armenia of trying to do this since the war ended despite many neutral Mediators pointing out that Armenia wasn\u2019t such as in 2005. Armenia/Azerbaijan: Mediator Sees No Organized Settlement Policy In Occupied Lands But Azerbaijan continued to press such accusations: \u201cArmenia's policy of trying to annex the occupied territories of Azerbaijan is doomed to fail. The only way to achieve a lasting solution to the conflict is to ensure the unconditional and complete withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces from the Nagorno-Karabakh region and other occupied territories of Azerbaijan, as required by relevant UN Security Council resolutions\u201d. [1] But this is no longer the case Yerevan starts settling Lebanese Armenians in occupied Karabakh Armenia is now pushing heavily on the whole \u201cChristian crusaders stopping the Islamic horde!\u201d narrative and is now trying to get Armenians to move into the buffer zone so that the land is thoroughly Armenianized and to wreck any negotiations over their status.  This photo was tweeted by the Armenian government, a priest holding a rifle. The message is very clear. As Armenia can\u2019t return the buffer zone to Azerbaijan if 500,000 Armenians live there. For Azerbaijan, this is very dangerous Not only would it lose Nagorno-Karabakh but it would lose a chunk of Western Azerbaijan with 800,000 Azeris permanently displaced from their homes. So a referendum would never work as: Armenia ethnically cleansed the Azeris from the regionArmenia is now encouraging Armenians to move inNaturally the people of Artsakh and the Armenian settlers will vote for Armenia in a referendum. Now to be fair, there are arguments in favor of Armenia\u2019s occupation/future annexation As I said before, Artsakh (the Armenian state) is some distance away from Armenia. The buffer zone is extremely beneficial for the two states remaining united and working together with trade and military affairs. Especially if you bear in mind that if the buffer zone is returned then it would be that Artsakh is completely surrounded by Azerbaijan and at Baku\u2019s mercy.  Artsakh in white and Azerbaijani land in blue. If the buffer zone is returned, Artsakh would find itself surrounded.

            "answer_text": "No, because Azerbaijan and Turkey wouldn\u2019t allow it. There are essentially two sides in this conflict: \u2022Armenia, supported by Russia; \u2022Azerbaijan, supported by Turkey; Armenia Armenia's claim over the Nagarno-Karabah region comes from historical possession of the region and due to the fact that the population of Nagarno-Karabah is majority armenian.  (Armenia during Roman times)  As we can see, ethnically speaking Nagarno-Karabah is an armenian region. Azerbaijan Azerbaijan's claim over Nagarno-Karabah comes from the fact that it was owned by the Azerbaijani Soviet Republic (when both Armenia and Azerbaijan where controlled by the Soviet Union) and that Nagarno-Karabah is legally Azerbaijani, as the region was taken by Armenia during a war.  As seen in the map above, the disputed region was part of the Azerbaijani Soviet Republic.  Nagorno-karabakhis de jure/internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory, while beeing de-facto under Armenia. Why wouldn't a referendum solve the issue? A referendum would undoubtedly end with a pro-armenian stance, due to the fact that the region is majority armenian. This would end in either Nagarno-Karabah becoming part of Armenia or a pro-armenian independent state, which would not be accepted by Azerbaijan and its allie, Turkey. ",
