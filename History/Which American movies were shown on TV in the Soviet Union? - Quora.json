            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, Sinan Ozeren. >> Which American movies were shown on TV in the Soviet Union? The trick is to memorize which US movies were shown on TV, since most of movies mentioned in the answers were displayed mainly in movie theaters, and appeared on TV only after 1991- the year of the Union collapse (like Disney\u2019s Darkwing Duck series and post-Soviet cult classics of Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers).  \u201cFeeblemindness and courage\u201d - Donbass rebels uniform badge inspired by \u201cChip\u2019n Dale\u201d cartoon. Dale is dressed as Don cossack volunteer. For example, it was really hard to see \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d(1960) or \u201cMacKenna\u2019s Gold\u201d (1969) in 1980s since they were purchaced in 1960s and were out of movie theaters rotation already. And to see those westerns on TV screen in 1980s was a big luck - the one I\u2019ve never had. And \u201cSome like it hot\u201d (1959) with Marilyn Monroe for some unknown reason was rotated in \u201cTheaters for repeated watch\u201d quite regularly - so I saw it in 1988 for the first time. But not on the TV-screen. Even \u201cThe Terminator\u201d (1984) appeared in cinemas in 1985\u20131986(?) along with \u201cKing-Kong\u201d (1976) but not on TV. So, answering the question, American movies or shows appeared on Soviet TV quite rearly and irregularly - so I could say that I never had a chance to see one watching Sovier TV since 1981 till 1991. Hollywood was present in movie theaters. ",

            "answer_text": "Which American movies were shown on TV in the Soviet Union?  In Soviet Union - none, same like there were no Soviet movies on US TV. But if you ask about Russian TV - the answer is : ALL OF THOSE that US has ever produced , including those bashing russians and Russia - if you watch Russian TV today you can watch at least dosen of american movies EVERY DAY on different channels dubbed in Russian language. The first US serial on Russian TV was Santa Barbara that was broadcasted since 1992. There is one exeption about Soviet Union\u2019s TV though - there was US 20-part documentary serial of 1978 with Burt Lancaster on wwII \u201cThe Unknown War\u201d- it was broadcasted on Soviet TV in 1978 Yet even in Soviet times american movies were shown in Soviet cinemas since 1960-s at least - all the classics by Stenly Kramer , Blake Edwards etc. = a commenter below corrected me that Eisensteins films were on american TV, then you can add Chaplin films to the list - those were on Soviet TV - but I didn\u2019t think the question was about movies without sound, lol == well, a commenter below corrected me again that all kinds of soviet films were shown on US TV - americans know better, I don\u2019t know, but I doubt it very much.

            "answer_text": "I was born in the USSR in 1977. So, my experience with the American movies in the USSR is quite limited by the time period of 9 years (in 1986 the USSR ceased to exist). Edit: the USSR ceased to exist in 1991 and not in 1986. The American movies were very popular and there was always a long queue to purchase a ticket to the cinema when an American movie was screening. (Well, the queues were not only in the cinema but also everywhere else including groceries etc )) Anyway, most of the movies that I recall were a western movies or an action movies. Here is a brief list of what I remember waching as a kid (just to name a few): The magnificent seven , 1960Three days of the Condor, 1975King Kong, 1976The snows of Kilimanjaro, 1952How to steal a million, 1966Tootsie, 1982Spartacus, 1960",

Cowboy movies: Magnificent Seven, MacKenna\u2019s Gold Social critique: Grapes of Wrath, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore Comedy: It\u2019s a Mad Mad Mad world Notable films often did not make it to the wide release. I don\u2019t think Apocalypse Now or Godfather were ever shown. Generally, movies that showed middle class America in sympathetic light were not seen: they were all bumbling idiots, or criminals or people in poverty, or cowboys and Indians. They were typically dubbed into Russian. Sexually suggestive scenes were cut. ",
