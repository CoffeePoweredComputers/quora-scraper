            "answer_text": "The Roman Empire aristocrats were civic minded men who used private money to build public buildings, such as theaters, baths, aqueducts, fountains and so on. Taxation went to the army, but also to building roads and harbors. Romans also spent a fair amount on public welfare, especially free corn for the urban plebs. All this was disrupted and destroyed by the Germanic invasions. German warriors were extremely loyal to their kings and chiefs. loyal to kin and clan, and a lot less loyal to tribesmen or people of another origin altogether. Instead of trial by experienced lawyers and magistrates, medieval justice was based on status and primitive rituals like the ordeal. Kings felt no obligation to keep up roads or fords or aqueducts, and many of them simply didn\u2019t have the faintest idea. Germans were completely ignorant of public sanitation; a few lucky cities like Paris and Rome had ancient sewers, but German and Frankish and Saxon aristocrats certainly weren\u2019t about to spend money on sewers. Medieval tax revenue was private property and went to feasting, clothing, jewelry, hunting, weapons, horses and war. The aristocracy was land rich and cash poor, almost always in debt. It was only with the revolution in thinking brought about by the Renaissance that a truly public spirit began to infiltrate into aristocratic circles. The medieval mind was cramped, narrow, superstitious and fearful. It also wasn\u2019t terribly literate, and it wasn\u2019t until 1350 or so that English and Italian began to be used as literary languages. The medieval mind was also very, very conservative and deeply fearful of heresy. In the eyes of the Church, every secular activity was sinful unless it was blessed by priests. The Church was looser about some sins than others, but in keeping with the age, Jewish pogroms were common and profitable. For peasants, the diet was monotonous and housing was cold and damp, not to mention completely infested with fleas, lice and bedbugs. ",

            "answer_text": "It is , of course, more complex than that, but here are my suggested three characteristics . Land useage is a basis for service, primarily military service . An estate is farmed by a warrior on the basis that he musters for war service and provides his own horse and armaments. Larger estates provide more warriors. A cautionary note, there were always mercenaries and town forces. Service for land goes all the way up the social structure, so that knights hold land from barons who hold land from Dukes or earls, who hold from the king.Barons and the like live in castles which are mostly private fortifications. There are royal castles on threatened frontiers or in troubled regions but the majority of such fortifications are privately held and it is expected that the top level of society will live in castles.Son follows father in all walks of life . Serfs on landed estates inherited their duty to farm and pay their taxes in kind, sending their grain to the manorial mill and having their draught horse shod at the manorial smithy. In towns son followed father in the guild that supervised all who worked in that particular trade.If I were to add characteristics one would be the intense religiosity of the period. Orater was regarded almost as an industry with salvation as an output r product. You could buy ahead masses for your soul which would aid your passage from purgatory to heaven. A large amount of productive capacity was absorbed in supporting the clergy and a wide range of religious institutions. Indeed, one of the signs of movement to the modern world is the closing of religious houses and the liberation if productive resource to providing more goods and services. ",
