            "answer_text": "Hey, Matthew. The most practical reason is that Germany had absolutely no capacity to fight a war in Southeast Asia and China posed no threat to Germany. After all, Germany didn\u2019t have the naval strength to cross the English Channel to invade Britain. On land they were not able to get to Moscow in the European part of Russia. Hitler\u2019s plans for German conquest had always focused on Europe and, somewhat indefinitely, part of Asian Russia. Beyond that, Japan\u2019s Chinese war had its own status. The Japanese invaded Manchuria in 1931 That was two years before Hitler had come to power and about six years before German rearmament proceeded far enough for Nazi Germany to assert itself militarily. When Germany and Japan made their WW II alliance in 1940, Japan\u2019s war with China was nine years old. Germany had been at war in Europe for a year. They probably agreed then that the two wars would remain separate. Hitler had made clear his military interest was in Europe and western Eurasia and he expected pick up African colonies through his European conquests. Japan was clear that its interest was in eastern Asia and the Pacific. Later Germany and Japan agreed that they would split Asia north to south along the 70th parallel, with Germany going not much farther east than the Urals. Asia from the west side of the Indian Subcontinent to the Pacific would be Japan\u2019s. (A door-opening 1936 German-Japanese agreement had been to cooperate to oppose communism.) Japan\u2019s strength was limited to its region of Asia and Germany\u2019s to its region of Europe, so it made sense for each to fight its own war in its own area. In 1941, Japan, Germany, and Italy forged the Axis. At the start, the three were to fight in delineated spheres of infuence: Italy in North Africa for the territory it planned to conquer, Germany in Europe, including western Russia, for land it expected to conquer, and Japan in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. But things very quickly started getting real. Mussolini was blowing it in North Africa, Hitler\u2019s decision to move the Nazis into North Africa is often presented as Hitler deciding to bail out Mussolini. But North Africa was relevant to the war in Europe. Hitler would have liked to break British control of the Mediterranean and Suez. Even more important for him was the reality that if Italy lost in North Africa, Italy itself would be vulnerable. Similarly, Hitler declared war on the U.S. four days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, with the timing to show solidarity with Japan. But it also was clearly connected to Hitler\u2019s concept of German strategic interests in the European war. The U.S. was already a major thorn in Germany\u2019s side. A British-American deal had provided Britain with American ships. The U.S. Lend-Lease Program ramped up war production and was providing Britain weapons and supplies at a greater than 90 percent discount. The Germans had come close to provoking war in the fall of 1941 when they sunk the U.S.S. Reuben James, which was protecting a British supply convoy. Hitler decided to declare war on the U.S. with little thought or consultation with the high command. They were totally absorbed in the crisis of the Battle of Moscow. He seems to have thought America would be totally focused on its war against Japan so would be no serious threat to Germany for quite some time, and that Germany probably would be at war with America later anyway. But Churchill and FDR decided to fight the wars against Japan and Germany jointly and to defeat Germany first, then defeat Japan. Hitler was stunned by how quickly the Americans mobilized. But there was no intersection between Germany strategic considerations and the war in China. ",

            "answer_text": "First) A German declaration of war against China would have done nothing. Germany had no desire to actually place troops that far from their established supply routes. Second) Germany didn\u2019t want to intercede in Japan\u2019s sphere of influence. The same reason you didn\u2019t see any German troops in China is the same reason you didn\u2019t see the Japanese attempt to invade England. Aside from the obvious logistical issues that would have made such an undertaking essentially an impossibility, neither Japan nor Germany had any friendly ports between those of Italy, and an actual debarkation point in China. So logistically it just wasn\u2019t a possibility. Third) Germany didn\u2019t need to declare war, it could take other measures which had a lot more impact than a token declaration of war. Such as recalling Alexander Von Falkenhausen who was the German military advisor to General Chiang Kai Shek and was assisting them with the modernization of their military. Which would have included tactics, training, armament, among other things. Without his assistance and expertise their fighting potential was less than it would have been otherwise. Regardless Germany recalled him (under threat that if he refused his family would incur the wrath of him disregarding their orders). Fourth) Germany simply didn\u2019t want to. We\u2019re talking 1937. At this point in time the allied powers might have suspected what Hitler\u2019s aspirations were, but they had no concrete proof. Germany hadn\u2019t announced that it was voiding versailles treaty, or that they were rearming. By declaring war on China they would have openly been displaying their intentions of violating the treaty, and on rearming. Doing so at such an early stage would have been extremely disadvantageous for Germany\u2019s goals. So in short, there was little reason to do so. It would have created massive problems, and absolutely no benefits. Japan didn\u2019t need or require Germany to do so as some token of loyalty. In fact Japan essentially eliminated China\u2019s ability to wage war fairly quickly relegating it to fighting a guerrilla war. It\u2019s not as though Japan needed Germany\u2019s help, and it\u2019s definitely not as if Germany would have been able to provide it should they have been asked to. ",
