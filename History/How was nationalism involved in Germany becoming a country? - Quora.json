            "answer_text": "I'm not sure nationalism as we know it today was much of a factor. Which is ironic given the \u00fcber-nationalistic orgies that belated nation state in the middle of Europe meted out on its neighbours. I'll condense some complex history in the following. In the 17th century, when Western European countries we know today formed as distinct nation states, usually as strongly centralised, absolutist, hereditary monarchies (Spain, pre-UK England, the Dutch Republic \u2014 a non-monarchical exception, but wealthier than others \u2014 and above all, France under the roi soleil)\u2026 the so-called Holy Roman Empire, neither holy, nor Roman, nor particularly imperial, disintegrated over what looked like religious strife at the surface, but what was really a conflict over central vs peripheral political control. The periphery won. This was detrimental; it blocked the path other nations were about to follow for the next 200 years. France was already a unitary state when its monarchy went bankrupt and the third estate (everybody, pretty much) realised little separated them from conquering political power from a corrupt thin upper crust (of clergy and aristocracy; first and second estate, respectively). The British monarchy and aristocracy dodged the trend. While they got their butts kicked by the nascent United States, they subsequently, rather than losing their heads, managed to modernise through gradual reforms (1833, 1867, 1911) extending electoral, albeit male-only, franchise. Germany by contrast remained a patchwork of anachronistic, petty, backwater fiefdoms well past the Age of Lights into the industrial revolution \u2014 with two exceptions, the rivalling power blocs of Prussia and Austria. The late 18th century realisation of being a nation of poets and thinkers had nothing to do with other nations not possessing such qualities, but rather, everything to do with finding that literature and liberal arts were the only qualities the Germans actually shared. Not very pragmatic qualities, one might add. But there was little else. Except music, perhaps. That left the German liberal democrats in a pickle: Before democratising the place they actually had to unify it. Both objectives, unsurprisingly, went squarely against the interests of the petty monarchs of the day, and the attempt to achieve unity and democracy failed in 1849, after an initially promising start. Some awkward form of national unity was achieved two decades later, top-down under Prussian dominance and at Austria's exclusion. Nationalism wasn't involved in that process so much as wars (Prussia-Denmark, Prussia-Austria, and Prussia-France), a confederation of monarchies, and ongoing suppression of Volkssouver\u00e4nit\u00e4t. The rest of Europe understandably worried. Unlike France or America with their revolutions, or Victorian Britain with its reforms and unstoppable modernisation, Germany did not achieve nationhood via some momentous event of collective unshackling. I rather believe it is the very separation of nationalism and democracy that proved to be a birth defect of the nation. Its nationalism consequently turned sour and insecure. The rest, as they say, is history. So no: Nationalism, if defined as a positive unifying force, a collective will to constitute oneself as a self-sovereign political club, was alas not the factor it could have been in becoming a country. The effects of the hundred-year time span from 1849 to 1949 can be felt to this day. ",

            "answer_text": "Goodness - totally. Like many countries, Germany is a \u2018nation\u2019 formed out of a theory that people are divided into different types - Nations. This theory was pioneered by Werder in the 1700\u2019s in Germany but first enacted when revolutionary France, having executed the King, needed a theory for holding together under attack. They invented the first National Anthem, National Flag etc. and exported the idea across Europe. Napoleon created the idea (and choose the flag) of \u2018Italy\u2019 (it was a peninsula before), forcing the creation of \u2018Switzerland\u2019 and uniting many states in what would later become Germany as the \u2018Confederation of the Rhine\u2019. People came to believe that unifying principalities into one country was a \u2018natural\u2019 product of the nation - although that excluded the German Speaking Austrians, the Low-Germans (the Neder-deutch or Dutch of the Netherlands) and the many German-speakers who lived father east (Budapest\u2019s first two newspapers were in German). (Oddly enough, Nationalists now believe in splitting countries.) So phony-baloney was this concept that even the name \u2018German\u2019 comes from a mistake by the Roman writer Tacitus. He had written a book on the tribes of northern Europe that he all called \u2018Germani\u2019 after a tribe Caesar had bumped into in Belgium. The tribe and the book both vanished, but the book was refound in the 1500\u2019s and, rather liking the rough, manly description of the \u2018Germani\u2019, the name was used to try to raise enthusiasm for a crusade. The peak came when and extreme Nationalist party came to power: the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP in German) came to power - we called them Nazis. Have a look at my book, \u2018Beliefs\u2019, full title above for a complete description. ",
