            "answer_text": "Wasn't so great, it should not be confused with circular Baghdad that has been abandoned after 50 years of creating it. Other Baghdad which is Al-Rusafa currently has been described by many historians as a miserable city that\u2019s nearly abandonded in different times before the Mongols (such as during the rule of Al-Mustaien \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u064a\u0646). I\u2019ve read about the Mongols invasion from different sources and there were few significant beautiful buildings in the city, ah and there\u2019s nothing such as 1 million or 30 million population in Iraq at that time, and I doubt what has been told about the river getting blue because the Mongols are throwing the books in the water, the most valuable books were saved and moved by Al-Tusi to Maragha.
