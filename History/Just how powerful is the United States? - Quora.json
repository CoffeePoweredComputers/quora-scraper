            "answer_text": "This is a very broad question, militarily speaking our navy rules the oceans, period. We have the ability to get military hardware to almost any point in the world within 24 hours, whether it is special operations forces, bombers, submarines with ballistic missiles (nuclear and conventional), we can station aircraft carriers anywhere in the world and we are the only country who will launch aircraft at night from a carrier. We have the best pilots of any military. Our spy network is in every country in the world, even places like the DPRK. Our NSA is an ultra invasive and powerful force that can penetrate almost every communications conveyance. We have embassies and diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world, and the ones we don\u2019t still receive aid or benefit from us, if even indirectly. Many countries rely on the U.S. for protection, food-aid, and medical aid. We prop up puppet leaders and dictators around the world and ensure they stay in power; conversely we have the ability to manipulate elections in countries to our favor. A U.S., along with a British passport are the most powerful passports in the world, requiring the fewest visa to enter other countries. The U.S. dollar is what OPEC uses to trade oil, in fact the U.S. dollar is accepted everywhere in the world in some form or fashion. When I was in Afghanistan I kept around $1000 taped to the inside of my body armor or in a cargo pocket, even in the tribal regions it was accepted. We are a country that leads in technology, innovation, and research. Yes, there are many countries that may rival us, or are leading in some aspects, but we aren\u2019t slackers. We have the best universities and we recruit the best intellectuals from around the world. We are protected by two oceans, and a friendly neighbor to the north. We are impenetrable, we cannot be invaded by anyone, period. The only thing that affects our interior security in cowardly, middle eastern, terrorists. It\u2019s really difficult to stop a rogue, radicalized, muslim from murdering innocent civilians. But a Red Dawn scenario is pure fiction. People don\u2019t die trying flee the U.S., but many die trying to get to this country. We are not without our faults; we don\u2019t have universal health care, we ignore mental health care issue too often, we have homeless people, people are discriminated in this country for the wrong reasons, we put too many people in jail/prison, our infrastructure needs tending to, we are not well like everywhere in the world, we meddle too much, we\u2019re slow to adopt alternative energy resources, we have an obesity problem, and obviously there is more. I\u2019m not a fan of our government at all, but I believe this country and its diversity of people and our abilities is the best in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Not as powerful as people think it is. The US owes enormous amounts of money to China and other countries, which effectively renders it economically powerless in the eyes of the world. The drastic and unprecedented rise in debt over the past decade has rendered the US even economically worse than ever and humbled in the eyes of the economic world. The US military is now quite small, only 0.4% of the US population. The Air Force has to go to airplane graveyards and get used parts off of old planes to keep it\u2019s planes flying. The defense spending compared to GDP is 60% less than it was after WWII was over and the US was at peace. That means the US military is quite weak, and all analysis of the US military I have seen recently have validated this conclusion. Everything the US has touched within the last decade in the world has not improved the world standing of the US, but rather diminished the power and influence of the US. The US was strongly involved in the Middle East, the result of which was the Arab Spring revolts, the rise of radical Islam and the expansion of countries ruled by Shariah law (which is brutal and oppressive to women and demands death for LGBT). The involvement of the US leaders in Brexit did not keep Britian in the EU. These clearly show the disdain the world holds the US in, which means power and influence are rapidly declining. With the recent policy of apologizing to the world for the US existing and everything it has ever done in the past, bowing and scraping to world leaders, we have lost the respect of most of the world. Without respect there is no power, unless one is strong enough to demand respect. The US is weak militarily and so has no leverage for any respect from any country world wide. The US has not been this weak since it\u2019s inception and prior to 1775, in my opinion. ",
