            "answer_text": "Bismarck. There\u2019s no one else in the running for the top spot. It\u2019s pretty hard to beat the effective father/founder of the modern nation, after all. Don\u2019t get me started on Hitler, unless \u201cgreatest\u201d can be stretched to mean \u201cmost evil ever\u201d, or on any of the transitional chancellors between Bismarck and Hitler. Most of them were nothing. Incompetent men hamstrung by a poorly thought out Constitution. Post World War II, Germany was led by titans. The allied powers filtered out so many candidates that only candidates of high calibre were allowed to take part in politics. Konrad Adenauer (1949\u20131963) : effectively rebuilt Germany after the war, and amazingly began to earn back a semblance of respect for his country.Ludwig Erhard (1963\u20131966) : Erhard had been Adenauer\u2019s Minister of Economics. He was the principle architect of the Wirtschaftswunder \u2014 the German economic miracle, in which a devastated Germany made an astonishing comeback as a major economic player in less than a decade. When he became Chancellor, however, his hands-off approach didn\u2019t seem to work so well. His colossal reputation as a financial wizard was, regrettably, undermined by his somewhat lackluster, and brief, period as Chancellor.Kurt Georg Kiesinger (1966\u20131969) : Brought in the first \u201cgrand coalition\u201d between the two major parties. This created an unprecedented consensus between right and left which survived long after the coalition had been disbanded.Willy Brandt (1969\u20131974) : Responsible for Ostpolitik. I personally feel that he was somewhat overrated, but his Ostpolitik undeniably gave West Germany an economic influence in Eastern Europe, which was one factor that worked in its favour when the Berlin Wall came down. Without Ostpolitik, it is doubtful that the Soviet Union would have agreed to German reunification as a member of NATO.Helmut Schmidt (1974\u20131982) : Successfully navigated the way through the aftermath of the oil shock. Germany was affected by global economic woes \u2014 high inflation and unemployment afflicted most of her trading partners, but remained lower in Germany than elsewhere. Germans today look back to Schmidt as a masterfully competent leader.Helmut Kohl (1982\u20131998) : Pulled off the unthinkable, with the reunification of Germany in 1990. To do this, he had to persuade Britain and France to agree to it (Margaret Thatcher was overtly, and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand covertly, hostile, but both gave in). He also had to get past the Soviet Union \u2014Gorbachev was cooperative, but many others in his government were not.There have been two Chancellors since Kohl \u2014 Gerhard Schroeder and Angela Merkel. Many Germans today regard them as lackluster and mediocre. What they fail to recognize is that they come from a generation that no longer had the \u201cfiltering\u201d of the Allied powers. In the older generation, all but the best leaders had been screened out, allowing a solid fifty years of leadership by giants. With that in mind, it seems unfair to compare the present generation of politicians to them. ",

Bismarck played the other countries off against each other. He basically created Germany and the German Empire.
