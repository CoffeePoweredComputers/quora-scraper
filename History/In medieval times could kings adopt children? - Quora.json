            "answer_text": "A King who didn\u2019t want a wife was in trouble. Heirs of the body were the rule for succession, as Dmitriy mentioned, as for the African adopted by Peter the Great, he was certainly not in the succession. His descendant Pushkin was bourgeois. In a way a king like anyone else could adopt an orphan as an act of mercy, but it would have been unusual, since the taking care of an orphan could be left to someone else, and since kings very generally did have heirs. Adopting a relative as one\u2019s heir, if childless despite marriage, that is another matter. It seems William the Conqueror was so adopted by Edward the Confessor, or that was the consensus up to recently: // Starting as early as William of Malmesbury in the early 12th century, historians have puzzled over Edward's intentions for the succession. One school of thought supports the Norman case that Edward always intended William the Conqueror to be his heir, accepting the medieval claim that Edward had already decided to be celibate before he married, but most historians believe that he hoped to have an heir by Edith at least until his quarrel with Godwin in 1051. William may have visited Edward during Godwin's exile, and he is thought to have promised William the succession at this time, but historians disagree how seriously he meant the promise, and whether he later changed his mind. // Godwin was of course the father of Harold Godwinson, the one who lost at Hastings.

            "answer_text": "I don't think so. Not even noblemen could, in many cases. For example, many charters that grant landed titles say \"heirs of the body\", and that usually meant legitimate children, so not even an illegitimate child could be substituted, let alone someone completely unrelated. (Of course this applies toward the later times when the laws actually known and applied, rather than  being no more than a whim of the ruler, or local customs that could be overturned). Even in 19th century Great Britain, the Parliament or the Queen would have to intervene to allow a title to be passed to a son-in-law, for instance, even when there were no living male relatives, and the son-in-law took his wife's surname - being effectively an adopted heir. In the Middle Ages especially, it was commonly believed that there was \"good blood\" and \"bad\", and adopting someone not of your blood was an iffy proposition and unlikely to be accepted by other relatives, at least in the Christian Western Europe.
