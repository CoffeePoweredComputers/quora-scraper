            "answer_text": "Reading the answers already posted here without question you\u2019ve been given some very good information. The most important of points which happened is if you\u2019ll remember what Admiral Yamamoto tried to convey to the Japanese High Command. Having gone to Harvard, being able to travel around America, he knew first hand what could happen if we banded together and turned this country into production Giant he envisioned! In the 1930\u2019s we were shipping scrap metal to Japan, we also began supplying England, and in 1941 with the German\u2019s seeming unstoppable as they raced across Russia, we began sending vast amounts of supplies to help the Russian\u2019s stem the tide. What you should also consider, this was prior to Pearl Harbor being attacked. The aftermath of that event pushed our industry leaders to build as never before, expand plants and factories and to hire all the people they could for they were going on a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year buildup in every type of goods needed, requested, or already being produced for the military. At war\u2019s end America was the only major nation which had not sustained horrible damage from the results of war. Europe was a mess, Russia was even worse, China didn\u2019t realize it but they were about to go through a change. Germany and Japan were devastated due to allied bombing. Shipyards railyards and logistics for getting food, clothing, and other supplies for the next 3 to 5 years was truly a challenge. It is what brought us to the fore front in every area because we could manufacture it and do so quickly. We helped every nation to feel the effects of World War 2, this under the Marshall plan, something which should be of interest to you also. In 1946 Russia put up what was called the Iron Curtain and we dealt with this until the early 1990\u2019s. We dealt with the \u201creal or phoney Cold War,\u201d and today with the ability to wipe out all life on this planet at least 10 times over when once is enough, this from nuclear bombs, biological and chemical warfare, another way is over population because this always brings starvation and disease. Lack of clean water to drink and cook with, so these are the other things which came about because of this war. Today quite possibly the worst thing which happened, mass communications in the form of news organizations. Everyone wants to know who the deep state is in the world, well when you earn a trillion dollars a year because of advertising, entertainment, and other means, those at the top of these organizations you more than likely can place at this table of people behind the scenes. This is just some of the items, there is a host of other\u2019s but for almost 70 years after the end of this war, America was the World Power. In fact if Truman had had any sense, with the atomic bomb he and the army he had already to go could have conquered the world, what\u2019s more we could have disarmed it too. We missed that opportunity back in 1946, but then again can you imagine the headaches? ",

            "answer_text": "This is such a broad question. On its face, it is simply because it affected so many people and regions of the world. Almost every country or territory was in the theatre of war with the exception of Antarctica. While WW1 was technically a world war, the action in the Pacific was very limited. Additionally, WW2 had the following significances: #1) It displayed the power of the US. The US was regarded as no power at all in WW1, and it was so late arriving into that conflict that the Europeans tended to regard them with contempt as a military force. In the run up to WW2, the US land forces were amazingly small\u2026a few active divisions. The US Navy was powerful, enough to be the subject to a variety of international naval treaties, but the airforce was also highly lacking in numbers and technology. By the time WW2 ended, the US was outproducing every other nation fighting\u2026combined! The output was really ridiculous. And while US soldiers and tanks may not have been the best, they proved their mettle. And the US navy and airforce really name into their own. Due mainly to the benefits of geography, the US emerged from WW2 relatively unscathed and an economic powerhouse and it catapulted them into the lead of the world stage, a role they have yet to relinquish. #2) WW2 saw a burst of technological advances that was mind boggling. At the start in 1939, most nations were still flying biplanes. By the end, jets were flying overhead and nuclear bombs were being dropped. Penicillin gained widespread use in 1942 because of the war. Radar was invented and put to use. Sonar was perfected. A host of innovations. #3) WW2 put in check the rise of despotism that grew in challenge to democracy. Mainly Fascism. Democracy, which had been burgeoning after WW1, suffered severe setbacks during the Great Depression. One outcome of WW2 was the UN (an institution I am not fond of, but when founded, its heart was in the right place). ",
