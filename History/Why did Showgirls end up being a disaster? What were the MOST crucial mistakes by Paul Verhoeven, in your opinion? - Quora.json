            "answer_text": "Paul Verhoeven\u2019s big mistake (or genius) as a director lies in his insistence on ignoring people\u2019s unhipness to what he\u2019s about. Irony is probably the only thing that\u2019s subtle about his movies, causing it to go right over people\u2019s heads. Watching Showgirls, the irony is self evident. The terrible dialogue, the sub-par acting, the ridiculous sex scenes: it all suggests the director\u2019s tongue was planted firmly in his cheek during the making of Showgirls. The most important theme in Showgirls (as well as his other movies) is (moral) ambivalence.* Have you ever noticed how morally reprehensible behavior is rewarded and forgiven almost every time it occurs in Showgirls? How every attempt at ethically sound behavior gets sabotaged? How the only \u201cgood guy\u201d (a girl, actually) to be found in the movie ends up being horribly punished (the beating and rape of the main character\u2019s roommate and confidante)? By the time the credits roll down the screen, all is forgiven, yet nothing is resolved. I admit, it\u2019s a stupid movie, but I\u2019m certain that Verhoeven intended it to be stupid in order to mess with our heads. If it\u2019s intentional, it can\u2019t really be called a \u201cmistake\u201d. I think we\u2019re supposed to have a sense of humor re Showgirls. It\u2019s no accident that the main character keeps telling us throughout the movie that it doesn\u2019t suck; the director probably realized we needed reminding of that. *My opinions on the importance of ambivalence in Paul verhoeven\u2019s movies: Marcus Bruijstens's answer to What are the controversies around the movie Elle?

            "answer_text": "This is a matter of opinion, of course; there are people who love the film.  I think it fails for two or three very basic reasons, beginning with hubris. The director and the writer both had huge egos, coming off the overhyped Basic Instinct. They thought (and had studio backing) that they could successfully make an outrageous film that would transform low art into high art. They had plenty -- probably too much -- money to throw at it and hired name actors who went along with the hype. They also paid themselves really well. But in the process, they developed a pretty terrible script. Esterhaus is a first-degree hack as a writer, but at the time was a bit of a Hollywood darling in spite of an obvious lack of talent on display, especially for this script. His films had had enough success, and he was making enough money on just his pitches to convince himself of his own merit, so this was another ego explosion. Verhoeven is a capable director, but his taste (or lack thereof) may get the better of him. He likes too much to shock rather than explore subtle drama, so the turn toward camp was natural for him. It is just singularly hard to pull off full camp while also acting like you are making a serious, mainstream drama. Capable or not in general, I just don't think he was capable of that. And especially not from that clunker of a screenplay. ",
