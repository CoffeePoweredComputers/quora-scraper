            "answer_text": "This question has a potential of endless cases and answers. Even to list all the variations is above my limited capability.  I will try to add my minor contribution by covering only one aspect: international conflicts- war- peace and policy. From the day human being history is recorded: War- Peace and Politics are an integral part of human being nature.  2 examples that shaped our modern times life: How a simplistic naive faulty politics didn\u2019t solve the pre ww2 conflict with NAZI Germany and in reality, speed up the world war 2. How a USA wise and complex politics prevented that the conflict with USSR named the cold to turn into WW3. Finally: did the world learned the political lessons of those 2 conflicts? --------- How the UK simplistic naive and faulty politics didn\u2019t solve the pre ww2 conflict with NAZI Germany and in reality, speed up the world war 2. The Munich Agreement is a symbol for the futility of appeasing expansionist totalitarian states leading to the most brutal war and not peace,  In 1938 the Munich agreement between Germany, Great Britain, France, and Italy permitted German annexation of the Sudetenland, in western Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain and Hitler signed a paper declaring their mutual desire to resolve differences through consultation to assure peace. Refer to the 1 October 1938 newspaper headline with the infamous Chamberlin declaration: \u201d I believe it is peace for our time\u201d. \u201cNow I recommend you to go home and sleep quietly in your beds.\u201d  In march 1939 Germany NAZI annexed the remainder of Czechoslovakia and in September NAZI Germany invaded Poland start WW2 .  The Munich Agreement is a symbol for the futility of appeasing expansionist totalitarian states, How a USA wise and complex politics prevented that the conflict with USSR named the cold to turn into WW3.  USA versus USSR conflict is named the cold war.  USA wan the cold war by a wise and complex politics. Most people anticipated that a devastating WW3 will be between the USSR and USA. Nobody anticipated the peaceful USSR collapse. USA developed a complex and multi-layer politic strategy it its conflict with the USSR- named the cold war. USA used of the huge USA economic advantage- dragged the USSR into; -the space defense initiative arm race that USSR couldn\u2019t compete. - supporting worldwide anti-communist governments, dragging USSR in huge expenses to support communist movements, guerrillas and wars. On the long run the burden on resources was over the USSR capacity and dried out its capacity by the international political competition. - use of any possible media channel to present to the people of East Europe and USSR the freedom and rights of their citizens compared to the USSR brutal oppression and to disclose the ever increasing life standard in the west compared to the East Europe and USSR people\u2019s daily file suffering and greater deprivations - USA imposed economic sanctions and restrictions against the USSR. The West Europe USA allies required revive on some of the sanctions imposed by the USA. - The East Europe and USSR citizens have been made fully aware that the capitalist system was much more efficient compared to the USSR communist system, generating personal and state wealth that the USSR couldn\u2019t match - The USSR communist system couldn\u2019t stand the conflict with the USA and collapsed politically in 1991.  Finally: did the world learn the political lessons of those 2 conflicts?  Well, it is difficult to say.  It is hard to say that the west \u2013 both USA and West Europe learned and implement the lessons of the Munich agreement, the symbol for the futility of appeasing expansionist totalitarian states. In USA, Carter, during a short period negotiated with USSR arms reductions resulting the SALT2 agreement. After this agreement the USSR become more aggressive and adventuresome after Carter withdrawal of NUKS from South Korea and invaded Afghanistan. The Reagan administration reimpose the traditional USA political pressure on its conflict with USSR.  Pls remember as well Carter passive policy against Islamist Iran dictatorship when the USA diplomats were hostages in Teheran. Today the world faces the Islamist Iran theocratic dictatorship witch in many aspects reminds the NAZI\u2019s. Unlike as against the USSR \u2013 the USA didn\u2019t develop and imposed a long-term multi-layer strategy. The West Europe countries are making conceptions to the aggressive Islamist Iran dictatorship- an empire on the making.  As well they are requiring USA to make concessions despite ever increasing aggression of Islamist Iran. President Obama (remember Carter) made the faulty agreement with Islamist Iran, resulting in the increase of Islamist Iran aggression and the final attempt to take over Iraq- Syria-Lebanon-Yemen and dictate their policy on the Gulf states.

            "answer_text": "I have never heard that conflict is important with politics EVER! Debating the topics is important and civility is expected, if not demanded, though you would never know it. In fact all things political and civil are supposed to be done \u201cin good faith\u201d, so where does good faith rest in a conflict? Your question is flawed beyond repair. ",
