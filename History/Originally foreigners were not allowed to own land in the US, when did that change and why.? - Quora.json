There were a number of laws passed in SOME states that forbade specific nationalities/ethnic groups from owning land, but this was NOT \u201coriginal\u201d as in from the founding of the US, and the Federal Government NEVER had such a law.

In fact, \u201cforeigners\u201d who had declared their intent to become citizens (but who had not done so) were free to homestead inexpensive land as far back as the law of 1862. Even though they were still \u201cforeigners.\u201d I have seen some pre-Civil War land records, and it appears that at least in some locations, new arrivals who had the resources were able to purchase residences, agricultural land, etc. as far back as the 1830\u2019s. I\u2019d be interested to know about any exceptions to this \u2014 do you have a citation? ",
