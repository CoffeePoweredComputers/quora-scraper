            "answer_text": "The easy answer is, like today, they grew, hunted or farmed it. However with quite a few differences. The majority of people lived in the countryside or small hamlets and made a living by forms of husbandry, that is basic farming; growing enough to feed themsleves and hopefully a little surplus to sell in order to buy (or barter) the things they needed. By the middle ages towns were growing and so were proto-industries, such as metal-working, crafts, leather making, wood-working. Also brewing, baking, candlestick making and all manner of small-scale manufacturing, many with great skill. The largest enterprise that led this early industrial revolution involved cloth making. That is all the processes to produce yarn and then to manufacture cloth and make things from it. So a farmer would typically go to town when he had a surplus to either set up a stall at the regular market or sell it direct to a trader or middle-man such as a weaver, baker or butcher say. So a virtuous circle meant a man might eat either by growing what he needed or by trading what he can make for the food he needed. On the surface a simple system and as long as harvests didn\u2019t fail one that worked for centuries. But don\u2019t be fooled, by the 15th Century (at least in England and Europe) it was quite a sophisticated operation with many layers and levels and increasingly well organised and governed, not least through the Trade Guilds and Livery Companies that evolved eventually into local government (hence many town council offices in England are called \u2018The Guildhall\u2019). Note: I have vastly simplified this answer to keep it brief. It conveys the point but there\u2019s a lot more to the economy and society in the middle ages, well worth reading up if interested. ",

            "answer_text": " Most people grew it. A peasant family usually lived in a village that shared the main fields where they would grow wheat or other grains (barley, millet or whatever grew best in their area), and pulses like peas, chickpeas, lentils. Each family had their own allotments, their size based on the family size. Different regions also had diferent crops such as grapes (for wine), cabbages, etc. Part of the fields were left fallow to regenerate the soil, and the cows woulsd graze in them, plus a communal pasture was used for more cattle and sheeps. Each family also had a greengarden and an orchard where they grew the greens and fruits they liked, a cop for their chicken and rabbits, and sometimes a pond for some fish. The woodlands and meadows would also provide them with wild greens, herbs, mushrooms, berries, and nuts. Milk was turned into butter or cheese and stored for winter, eggs were stored in ashes, meat was cured. Some more of the produce, unless our peasant was rich enough to own his own fields, was handed over to the local lord, who could be a noble or a monastery, in the form of taxes. Some of the produce was regularly brought into the local market (usually in the nearest town) and sold to city dwellers who could only count on a small greengarden and maybe a couple chicken, but who also had jobs paid in cash. People who lived in the cities would have to buy from the peasants most of their supplies. Peasants also brought their grains to the miller, who was paid in flour: a certain quota of the flour remained as his payment, in turn the miller would use some to bake his own bread, the rest would be sold to the bakers who baked bread for the towns.

            "answer_text": "Everyone says it is local, but Italy has a tradition of dried stockfish that goes back to the 12th century - that is Iceland caught cod air dried and then shipped. So fishermen were spending a season in Iceland fishing, landing their catches and drying it and then sailing back to Italy at the end of the season with a ship load of dried fish (which not only takes a fraction of the space fresh fish takes but also survives without refrigeration. Their was also significant trade in grain out of Poland and Ukraine up the rivers and then round from the Baltic through the Channel across the Bay of Biscay round the Iberian peninsular and into to Med. Or down the Rhine and transhipped to the Danube. Spices are so valuable you can ship them from the East Indies But 90% of food is local. There is no point taking food more than a few miles by ox or horse cart as after a few miles the beast eats more than it can carry or pull. But boats can carry bulk food - provided it is not perishable. Shipping is expensive - goods are either carried by cart animal or by boat. While boats can carry much more there are no containers so loose goods need to be shovelled out of holds by hand (which indeed is pretty much the case until the 1960s. It is only with containerisation that shipping costs effectively vanish. So villagers eat the food they grow and sell the surplus to pay for the non food essentials. Townsfolk (who are perhaps 10% of the population) are not forming so buy food with the income earned form their specialist labour. But while many townsfolk can afford meat they can still only eat what is available At this time butchers will kill and butcher animals in the market square (in the shambles a name retained in Brighton and York) -later they will kill the animals out the outskirts of town and only bring carcasses into town. Cambridge still has a cut throat lane. just beyond Stourbridge - which marked the Medieval boundary. If you live in a house the household can cook for the extended household - the master and family, his servants, journeymen and apprentices. But if you are a day labourer renting a room or part of a room or if you are travelling - you need to eat street food. So most towns live on the surplus from their hinterland - but that can be topped up by long distance supply by boat. So a Northern European will never see an apricot - and even a King of a Mediterranean realm can only eat them fresh during their brief season. Indeed the season is so short the phrase \u201cin the Apricot season\u201d has a similar meaning to \u201dwhen pigs fly\u201d. Everyone eats seasonally. So in late winter and early spring you are living on that which will store. Grain, peas, apples. Grapes can be dried (raisins, sultanas, currants) as can dates. Citrus peel can be candied. It is no coincidence Christmas cake and mince pies feature these exotic fruits flavoured with spices - all very expensive so showing off wealth. The Marzipan (almond paste) also comes from the Med as does the sugar used in the icing. ",

In the background of gunblasing riders of different affiliations, you would see people who grow crops. Some of them have enough to set up a shop to deal with horses or tools, or open a tavern.  In Westerns, there are border territories, where forests are abundant - and there are woodcutters and huntsmen.  There are roadbuilding projects and silver mines where people earn their bread through hard work. The same stuff happened in the Middle Ages. As modern art research shows - it\u2019s not entirely a coincidence [1]. ",

The Papacy had banned the eating of meat in Lent so herring from the Baltic and dried cod from around Iceland, Faroes and Norway were exported to other European countries. Then over in England, serfs raised pigs, hens, sheep and cows but their Norman lords ate the meat. So words like pork, poultry, mutton and beef originated from Norman French. mutton - Wiktionary ",
