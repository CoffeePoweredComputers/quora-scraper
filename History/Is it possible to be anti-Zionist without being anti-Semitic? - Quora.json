            "answer_text": "YES. It is perfectly possible to be Anti-Zionist without being an Judenhasser (I prefer this word to Antisemite). Zionism is the belief that the Jews as a people have a right to a nation-state in which to live. In religious circles prior to the 19th century, most Jews could be said to be anachronistically Anti-Zionist. In fact, most Orthodox Jews were Anti-Zionist until the mid-1960s. Since Zionism is a political philosophy that believes in Jewish self-determination, it can be criticized and I would say up to and including the valid basis for the Jewish State a polity. All of that being said, Anti-Zionism is usually cover for Judenhass. There are two typical ways that Zionism is criticized that reveal an underlying Judenhass argument. (1) Exclusivity to the Jews: There are many Anti-Zionists who reject the Jewish right to self-determination, but completely accept other ethnic groups\u2019 rights to self-determination and/or completely accept other religious groups\u2019 rights to self-determination. If you believe that Poland is a legitimate manifestation of the Poles\u2019 right to govern themselves, that Pakistan is a legitimate manifestation of Muslim South Asians\u2019 right to govern themselves, that Malaysia is a legitimate manifestation of the Malay peoples\u2019 rights to self-governance, but that the Jews lack such a right, this is Judenhass. You are reserving one standard for Jews and one standard for other people. If Poland, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Lithuania, Armenia, Georgia, Pakistan, Thailand, and numerous other countries based on ethnonationalism are legitimate then Israel is necessarily legitimate because it is based on the same kinds of claims. If Israel is treated uniquely, this is the problem. If you reject the validity of all ethnonational governments, you are certainly in the minority, but your view is ideologically consistent and acceptable. Norman Finklestein makes this kind of argument and while I find him repulsive (because he supports Jihadists), I don\u2019t believe him to be a Judenhasser. (2) Indirect Reference to the Jews: Many people use the term \u201cZionism\u201d or \u201cZionist\u201d as a way of making derisive references to Jews without using the word \u201cJew\u201d since it has been made clear that polite company will not accept derisive comments about Jews. Accordingly, when Zionist is used not to represent \u201cthose people regardless of religion who believe in the validity of a Jewish State\u201d and could be easily substituted with the word \u201cJew\u201d, the criticism of Zionism is simply a way of masquerading and hiding Judenhass. For example, when someone says, \u201cI disagree with Zionism because I believe that all of the people between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River should self-determine in one country\u201d this is not Judenhass hiding behind Anti-Zionism. However, when someone says, \u201cThe Zionists created the Holocaust in order to drum up world sympathy,\u201d this is clearly the Judenhass statement \u201cThe Jews created the Holocaust in order to drum up world sympathy.\u201d Ask yourself would the statement make sense if you replaced the word \u201cZionism\u201d with the words \u201cChristian Support(ers) for the State of Israel\u201d, since the largest number of Zionists are Christian. The first statement still makes sense. The second statement now sounds ridiculous. This is how you can easily see when \u201cZionism\u201d is simply a code-word for \u201cJews\u201d in polite conversation. While this seems like the kind of thing that a Jew would not do, there are numerous Jews who do support claims of the existence of Jewish cabals or secretive, malevolent organizations. \u201cBrother Nathaniel\u201d, for example, claims that he was born a Jew but converted to Orthodox Christianity and believes Jews to be behind numerous conspiracy theories using the word \u201cZionist\u201d to refer to them.
