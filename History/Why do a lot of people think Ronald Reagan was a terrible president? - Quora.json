            "answer_text": "Was he terrible? Obviously there are those who will pick both sides of this. I\u2019ll try and run down the middle. Philosophically, Reagan embodied a lot of good ideas about self reliance, the value of freedom and so on. Here is the rub: He wasn\u2019t a great implementer of his ideas and was surrounded by toadies that took advantage of his ideas and him personally to further their agenda;I think that after he was shot he never really got back in the saddle, so to speak, and slowly became mentally and energetically less capable, which only enabled to #1 situation to get worse.For me there is too much name calling and hyper-partisan hyperbole in today\u2019s politics. So\u2026 I\u2019d offer two controversial facts that, if you can maintain some degree of objectivity, are interesting in light of the increasingly diminished capacity Reagan seemed to manifest: Reagan and Tip O\u2019Neil worked together well, and got lots done, even though they were from opposite parties.Reagan did not oppose funding for AIDS research as some assert, as this NYT article shows: REAGAN DEFENDS FINANCING FOR AIDS - He said, ''Yes, there's no question about the seriousness of this, and the need to find an answer.'' From 1981 to 1985 his administration spent about 1/2 billion on the crisis. That used to be considered a lot of money. That\u2019s not to say more shouldn\u2019t have been done, but having lived at that time I\u2019ll remind you that everyone in authority was slow to understand and take action on AIDS.Reagan was not hostile to homosexuals. Rock Hudson and other gays were guests in the White House. In the circle were, paraphrased \u201cTed Graber, who spent the night at the White House with his lover, Archie Case. Graber was also a frequent guest at state dinners, as was the ubiquitous Jerry Zipkin. By far the most influential gay man in the Reagan inner circle was Robert Gray\u2026\u201dOp-ed: The Gay Truth About Ronald Reagan One other truth: Beginning with a few hundred thousand dollars in FY 1981, federal HIV/AIDS funding in- creased to $8 million only one year later, and then nearly doubled every year from FY 1982 to FY 1989. To criticize Reagan, and the government in general, as being too slow to respond to AIDS to distally fair, IMHO. But people are complex and imperfect, and certainly that includes Reagan (and even more so, Nancy.) To demonize Reagan as anti-gay is not accurate. So terrible? Pretty subjective. Less effective than he should have been? Yes, I\u2019d agree. Let the stoning begin. ",

            "answer_text": "Ronald Reagan worked really hard, with the benefit of hindsight, to be on the wrong side of history. He was nothing but a first-rate entertainer who enthralled his people for two-terms in office. Ronald Reagan was full of charm. He was a sham. A straw man. By more than a mile. Reagan went on to prove Hugh Sidey's observation, on Reagan's inauguration that \u201cReagan is not brilliant in anyway...\u201d (Time magazine, November 17, 1980) Against the backdrop of the Iran Hostage Crisis that came to characterize Jimmy Carter\u2019s administration, Ronald Reagan was a welcome relief: America with some spunk.  Who was not charmed by the sham? But, decades on, it should be obvious that Ronald Reagan oversaw a mean-spirited all brawn, no-brains government, whose legacy continue to haunt the politics and the economy of the United States of America. Reaganomics is a big lie used to justify robbery of the American people for the very rich. Ronald Reagan killed American middle class by infamous tax cuts, justified by the ruse of trickle-down voodoo \u2018economics\u2019.Reaganomics instituted the Greed Creed whose fruits were Enron, Merril Lynch, WorldCom, AIG, etc, decades later.Massive tax cuts for the super-rich, at the expense of other Americans never trickled down. Instead increasing income disparity has long since become the norm. \u201cIn 1986 we dropped the top income tax rate from 50 to 28 percent and the corporate tax rate from 46 to 34 percent,\u201d said Bruce Bartlett, a policy adviser in the administration of President Ronald Reagan. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger increase in incentives than that, and I can\u2019t remember any big boost to growth.\u201d NEW YORK TIMESReaganomics ultimately busted the federal budget by tripling the national budget, from $0.908 trillion to $2.7 trillion, between 1980 and 1989.Footloose capital in search of short-term returns is detrimental: It should be obvious now that the philosophy of market is a god is not economic theory, but a political ideology evidenced by America losing its place as a superpower, with perennial trade deficits, the fall of Lehman Brothers, the Asian Financial Crisis, etc, in tow.The philosophy of \u2018government is the problem\u2019, now well entrenched in America, which is unfortunately being forced down the throat of many developing countries by the IMF and the World Bank, started under Ronald Reagan.Unprecedented military build-up Massive increase in defense spending in the face of obviously declining Soviet power and economy, while undoing the very foundation of the country\u2019s economic prowess; cuts in investment in quality education, non-defence research and development, quality infrastructure, etc.The Strategic Defense Initiative, according to Lists: Rankings About Everything, Voted On By Everyone \u2018\u2026.became a black hole of theoretical research, pop culture ridicule, political tension, and spent money. Estimates on the cost of SDI research and development start at $100 billion, and run as high as $150 billion.\u2019War on Workers, Trade Unions and Middle-class Americans Ronald Reagan waged an all-out war against trade unions and low-come Americans, as though to deny them the American Dream by targeting domestic discretionary spending:Cuts in Federal spending between 1981 and 1988, after correcting for inflation,Subsidized housing lost 80.7% of its support,Training and employment services 68.3%, andHousing assistance for the elderly 47.1%. (Thanks to Robert Parry)Race Relations Ronald Reagan mobilize anti-black sentiment among whites for political gains by actively fostering racial disharmony and hatred as a strategy to gain white electoral support.The war on welfare system has to be justified by the caricature of an invariably black \u2018Welfare Queen\u2019 who, in Reagan\u2019s words, \u201c\u2026 used 80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans\u2019 benefits for four nonexistent deceased veteran husbands, as well as welfare. Her tax-free cash income alone has been running $150,000 a year.\u201d \u2026and this became the basis for government policy!As though blacks hold a monopoly on the tendency of human nature to exploit systems for selfish gains. (Why don\u2019t we scrap capitalism given tendency of human nature to engage in fraud? and mechanized transport because of the incidence of careless drivers, drunk driving?).Reagan\u2019s War on Drugs was a race war. A race war on inner-city blacks by law enforcement and the America judicial system to flood American prisons with African-Americans, as though they have a monopoly on drug use. All the while, the Reagan administration fueled the drug supply into America by funneling aid to Central American drug cartels in the name of fighting Communism.Short-sighted, Unprincipled, Might-over-Right Foreign policy That saw to the creation of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Al-Qaeda and sowed the seeds that came to roost on September 11, 2001 and continue to haunt global peace.Little sense of leveraging of soft power and haste to gun-boat diplomacy that became entrenched: ultimately saw linking of Saddam Hussein to Al-Qaeda and possession of weapons of mass destruction, to justify a war, and the creation of ISIS.\u2018Constructive engagement\u2019 with the apartheid regime in South Africa; Reagan stood against the widespread students protests on campuses across the United States, the US Congress and the United Nations to defend atrocities of the apartheid regime. Congress \u2013dominated by his own Republican party- has to override his veto against sanctions against the evil regime.Reagan could not wait to lift UN arms embargo on apartheid South Africa in his first year in office complemented with a $1.1billion IMF loan.Here is what history has to say of him: \u201cOverall, historians characterized Reagan's social policy as ``wrongheaded and malignant' and his foreign policy as unnecessarily belligerent, Murray and Blessing said. Nine out of 10 considered Reagan intellectually unqualified to be president.\u201d HISTORIANS RANK REAGAN AMONG THE MEDIOCRE It should be clear that the \u2018Great Communicator' was excellent in selling a dummy.
