            "answer_text": "Question: What is the best evidence for a historical Jesus? When it comes to ancient history, there may be no such thing as \u201cbest evidence,\u201d particularly if you are looking for evidence in the sense of that which can be provided for recent, modern history or in the sense of the degree of probability that science can arrive at by direct observation or by reproducing the results of experiments in a laboratory. In matters of ancient history, the amount of time lapsed, the methods ancient historians and writers used to record events, and in some cases the literary practices of the ancient culture make that type of evidence almost non-existent. Historians are faced with the task of using what evidence does exist from that time period. Just verifying what authentic records and artifacts exist from a specific period of ancient history is difficult. After that, a historian must then try to determine what most likely occurred based solely on the evidence and probability, carefully filtering out bias or intuitions based on what occurred in other cultures or time periods. Amateur theorizing, apart from intricate knowledge of the various types of evidence, is not helpful. That said, in my opinion the short, non-theological answer is this: Existing documents support the conclusion that Jesus was known as a historical person by Christian writers within twenty years of his death, and by non-Christian writers sixty to one hundred twenty years after his death. This is as close as honest scholarship can take us at this time, and from there we must draw our own conclusions. This is also the nature of ancient history, and studying the evidence for other historical figures in ancient history will confirm the difficulty of the process. However, that does not prevent a person from trying to filter out bias, subjective theorizing, and subjective intuitions and then reasonably weighing the evidence in the light of probability. The conclusion will still be far from certain but, again, that is the nature of ancient historical studies. As this has been a subject I have pursued for some time, I will add three points to the discussion concerning the nature of evidence that can be presented for people and events from ancient history. Number two is lengthy, but necessary to the context of my answer. First, different people have different opinions on what constitutes evidence. To me, evidence must be verifiable, which means using the best methods available to establish the evidence as credible and to determine its usefulness in evaluating the probability that a claim is true. Especially in the study of ancient history, verifiability of historical documents is an essential part of reconstructing the past, but verifying documents does not necessarily verify the people or events recorded in those documents (the authors could have been mistaken or embellishing for their own purposes). Second, for those who do not understand the academic disciplines of philology, textual criticism, and historical criticism and how each is applied to the study of ancient writings, this is a subject on which you would do well to read the basics and read the various scholarly views on the relevant texts. I am not a philologist or textual scholar (though I did study the Koine Greek of the New Testament), and have only limited education in historical criticism, but I have studied what many scholars have written about the New Testament and historical and religious writings of that era. Intuition about how historical documents sound to our modern ears is of little value when forming opinions on the validity or authority of ancient writings. Drawing analogies to religious or mythical writings from other cultures in order to determine what did or did not happen in Palestine in that era is fanciful thinking, and this is where many who hold to the Jesus Myth theory jump off the trail of evidence to theories based on modern perceptions, not on ancient, historical and philological evidence and context. Because a myth existed in history before the time of Christ is not always proof that the myth's influence extended to Palestine. Only textual or archeological evidence can establish that link. In logic, this is the old adage that \"before\" does not necessarily mean \"because of\" when it comes to causality. Textual criticism is an academic discipline, a branch of philology, that deals with determining as accurately as possible the original texts of ancient writings by identifying additions, transcriptions, errors, and embellishments. Like other branches of textual scholarship dealing with dates, authorship, and origins, it is applied to all manner of ancient manuscripts from the Tanakh and the New Testament to the writings of Flavius Josephus (and more recently to literary works like the Canterbury Tales and Shakespeare). Scholars examine the texts of religious, historical, philosophical, and fictional writings to determine as far as possible who the author was, the date of writing, and the original text. From there, historical criticism seeks to understand historical context of the text in order to further verify authorship and to best determine the probable meaning of the text. Both are a part of the science of philology, with philology including a greater emphasis on literary form, though the line is not hard or fast. Considering the importance of philology, textual criticism, and historical criticism and applying them to non-Christian writings that mention Jesus, below are the ones usually mentioned, with my opinion on each. The Testimonium Flavianum of Flavius Josephus about Jesus in Antiquities, written about sixty years after Jesus is recorded as dying, is recognized as having additions by most scholars, religious and otherwise. There is some ongoing debate about the entire passage being an insertion. From all I have read, part of the text is authentic, but additions have been made that embellish the theological status of Jesus. Josephus also mentions James, the brother of Jesus, and this text has been called into question as an insertion by some, but not nearly as much as the Testimonium. However the text in which Josephus mentions John the Baptist is much less controversial, and all but a very few consider it authentic (See: Josephus on Jesus). Pliny the Younger, a Roman governor, mentions Christians, but not Christ, in a letter to the Roman emperor, Trajan, in about AD 111, about 80 years after Jesus death. The reference is authentic. (See Pliny the Younger on Christians). Tacitus, too, mentions Christians in about AD 116, and there is little debate about authenticity (See: Tacitus on Christ). However, a larger debate surrounds the significance of these texts. In other words, does mentioning Christians or John the Baptist offer any proof that Jesus existed? No, it indicates that there were people living within one hundred years of Jesus who referred to him as a historical person. Concerning early Christian writings about Jesus, particularly the synoptic gospels and some of the Pauline Epistles, it would be a breach of sound scholarly practice to disregard them as evidence to be considered, just as it would not be sound practice to dismiss the writings of Plato or Xenophon concerning Socrates. Almost everything we know of Socrates comes from the works of two of his students and a contemporary dramatist. However, their bias is not enough to rule out the historical significance of their writings. That said, it is not the message of the gospels or Pauline Epistles that is important from a historical perspective, or what they claim about Jesus, but the fact that within twenty to forty years of the death of Jesus people believed he was a historical figure, wrote letters to others about him, and attempted to write down stories about his life and teaching. Mark is probably the earliest gospel, written about thirty or forty years after the death of Jesus, followed closely by Matthew. Luke dates within first century, and John falls at the close of the first century, AD 90-120. Perhaps more importantly, the Pauline epistles that are considered to be authentic by most scholars (Romans, I and II Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, I Thessalonians, and Philemon) are real letters to groups of Christians in historic cities, written within twenty to thirty years of Jesus death. In these letters you find references to events within ten years of Jesus death, and the writer considers Jesus, his brother James, Peter, and many other early associates to be real people, having met and conversed with them. The mention of these events and these specific people in written correspondence to specific groups of people is historically significant, even more so than the later gospels, which were more formal records. Not surprisingly Richard Carrier and others who hold to the Jesus Myth position use all sorts of arguments to discredit these and other passages, arguments that the majority of textual critics and philologists who specialize in this area, both secular and religious, reject. The seven authentic letters of Paul mentioned above are the closest historic written links we have to the historical Jesus and to those who heard him speak. Not surprisingly, written just twenty years after Jesus death, these letters do not elaborate on the specifics of Jesus ministry because their purpose was to address topics of concern among followers already familiar with the oral traditions of his life. So, within the New Testament, which as a whole contains obvious bias and some books that are pseudepigraphal, there are historical documents and references that the preponderance of secular and religious scholars who specialize in the field, and who utilize accepted methods of philology, find to be evidentiary to the historicity of a person named Jesus. Concerning the New Testament as a collected body of work, while it is true that the earliest complete copy of the New Testament dates to about 300 years after the time of Christ, there are numerous smaller fragments that attest to the fact that earlier attempts were made to write down the sayings and actions of Jesus. There have been recent claims about fragments dating earlier, but the earliest gospel fragment on which almost all scholars agree is P52, known as the Rylands Papyrus, measuring approximately 8.9 x 6 cm (3.5 x 2.5 inches), which is dated around 125 A.D. (See: St John Fragment; Rylands Library Papyrus P52). Below: Rylands Papyrus P52, from AD 125-175, a portion of John 18:31\u201333, 37\u201338  Many more fragments of various sizes exist from 150-400 A.D. Particularly interesting are those of the synoptic gospels, which even non-Christian scholars see as indicating a connected oral and written history of early Christian teachings about Jesus. (See: List of New Testament papyri). Papyrus 1 - a portion of Matthew 1;1-9,12,14-20, from Wikipedia  Again, this does not prove that all of the events recorded in the New Testament are true, nor does it prove Jesus was a historical person. It does indicate that in the decades following the year given as Jesus death, a group of followers began to record teachings and actions attributed to him in an attempt to establish him as bona fide prophet and the Messiah. The authors of the synoptic gospels, unidentifiable except by later tradition, wrote from thirty to ninety years after the death of Christ and were well educated and fluent in Greek. His disciples were most likely not educated in this manner, according to the accounts describing them, and excluding the remote possibility that they somehow managed to acquire this education needed to do so, or dictated the full manuscripts to someone else, the writers of the gospels were not eyewitnesses to the events they describe. They were transcribers of oral tradition, and possibly drew on some earlier written works. The Gospel of Luke gives the best account of what these gospels represented: an attempt to write down the oral traditions of the sayings and deeds of Jesus (Luke 1:1\u20134). Since reports of \u201cmiracle workers\u201d were common at the time, as miracles were seen as supporting a prophet\u2019s claim to authority, it is not surprising that many are included, though they cannot be historically verified as having occurred. As reports of prophets raising people from the dead were not unheard of at this place and point in history, and Jesus also was said to have raised people from the dead, the resurrection of Jesus was not as implausible in the minds of first century inhabitants of Palestine as it might be today, and would not necessarily be a deterrent in the growth of Christianity. Is this absolute proof Jesus existed? No. It is proof that forty to sixty years after the time Jesus was said to have lived that a large following of people reportedly believed that he did exist. Which brings me to my third point: What do you consider acceptable evidence that supports the premise that Jesus did or did not exist? As this is an emotionally charged subject, I find that many on both sides often adjust their level of evidence based on their previous bias, and then try to place the burden of proof on the other party. Granted, extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence, but neither textual scholars nor historians can provide the type of evidence that scientists can present by observation or experimentation concerning scientific laws that can be observed today. Philologists and historians can gather all the existing texts and then use principles of philology and textual criticism to arrive at the probability of the origins, authenticity, and content of the text. From there, they then look at the probability that the text is an accurate representation of history. That is far from certainty, but it is all historians can do for ancient writings and history. One must consider that, from what we know of the record, Jesus was not a government official or an official leader of the Jewish people. He was an itinerant, apocalyptic preacher and teacher who proclaimed that Israel would soon be delivered from its Roman oppressors, and that it would happen in the lifetime of those to whom he spoke. Prophets and preachers with a variant of this same message were not uncommon, and some gained a following while others did not. Those who the Roman leaders felt were a threat to peace were dealt with swiftly and often harshly. Most of the people of Palestine were not literate, and those who could read and write were most often doing so for the government, including historians, or for religious purposes. Historians, scholars, and religious leaders were a tiny and select group, and wrote about only the most significant events. That Jesus is mentioned in any context is remarkable. With all of the above considered, the best evidence for a historic Jesus is in line with the evidence for other people who existed and influenced history at that time. Still, this is not absolute proof that Jesus was a historical person. However, conclusions like author Richard Carrier presents in his book Proving History: Bayes\u2019s Theorem and the Quest for the Historical Jesus and other deductive conclusions about the evidence are also not proof that Jesus did not exist, but theories about that evidence. Theories depend upon the fair evaluation of evidence, and evidence can be misconstrued or disregarded by bias, particularly if the best principals of philology and textual criticism are not used to fully list all relevant data in the equation or deduction. In my opinion, the best evidence leads to the conclusion that I stated in my original short answer: Jesus was known as a historical person by non-Christian writers eighty to one hundred years after his death, and by Christian writers twenty to forty years after his death. That is as close as honest scholarship can take us at this time, and from there we must draw our own conclusions. My personal assessment is that a man by the name of Jesus existed, and that he was probably an itinerant, apocryphal prophet and teacher, the likes of which were not uncommon at the time. That his existence, or at least the claim that he existed, evolved into a religion that has so impacted humans over the course of time is amazing to ponder, whether you are a Christian, practice a different faith or spirituality, or an atheist.

            "answer_text": "I was compelled to research this one. Didn\u2019t take long. The following was one of my findings. It\u2019s \u201crather\u201d long; so, pardon the time involved in reading: Michael Gleghorn examines evidence from ancient non-Christian sources for the life of Jesus, demonstrating that such sources help confirm the historical reliability of the Gospels. Evidence from Tacitus Although there is overwhelming evidence that the New Testament is an accurate and trustworthy historical document, many people are still reluctant to believe what it says unless there is also some independent, non-biblical testimony that corroborates its statements. In the introduction to one of his books, F.F. Bruce tells about a Christian correspondent who was told by an agnostic friend that \u201capart from obscure references in Josephus and the like,\u201d there was no historical evidence for the life of Jesus outside the Bible.{1} This, he wrote to Bruce, had caused him \u201cgreat concern and some little upset in [his] spiritual life.\u201d{2} He concludes his letter by asking, \u201cIs such collateral proof available, and if not, are there reasons for the lack of it?\u201d{3} The answer to this question is, \u201cYes, such collateral proof is available,\u201d and we will be looking at some of it in this article. Let\u2019s begin our inquiry with a passage that historian Edwin Yamauchi calls \u201cprobably the most important reference to Jesus outside the New Testament.\u201d{4} Reporting on Emperor Nero\u2019s decision to blame the Christians for the fire that had destroyed Rome in A.D. 64, the Roman historian Tacitus wrote: Nero fastened the guilt . . . on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of . . . Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome. . . .{5} What all can we learn from this ancient (and rather unsympathetic) reference to Jesus and the early Christians? Notice, first, that Tacitus reports Christians derived their name from a historical person called Christus (from the Latin), or Christ. He is said to have \u201csuffered the extreme penalty,\u201d obviously alluding to the Roman method of execution known as crucifixion. This is said to have occurred during the reign of Tiberius and by the sentence of Pontius Pilatus. This confirms much of what the Gospels tell us about the death of Jesus. But what are we to make of Tacitus\u2019 rather enigmatic statement that Christ\u2019s death briefly checked \u201ca most mischievous superstition,\u201d which subsequently arose not only in Judaea, but also in Rome? One historian suggests that Tacitus is here \u201cbearing indirect . . . testimony to the conviction of the early church that the Christ who had been crucified had risen from the grave.\u201d{6} While this interpretation is admittedly speculative, it does help explain the otherwise bizarre occurrence of a rapidly growing religion based on the worship of a man who had been crucified as a criminal.{7} How else might one explain that? Evidence from Pliny the Younger Another important source of evidence about Jesus and early Christianity can be found in the letters of Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan. Pliny was the Roman governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor. In one of his letters, dated around A.D. 112, he asks Trajan\u2019s advice about the appropriate way to conduct legal proceedings against those accused of being Christians.{8} Pliny says that he needed to consult the emperor about this issue because a great multitude of every age, class, and sex stood accused of Christianity.{9} At one point in his letter, Pliny relates some of the information he has learned about these Christians: They were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to Christ, as to a god, and bound themselves by a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft or adultery, never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up; after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble to partake of food\u2013but food of an ordinary and innocent kind.{10} This passage provides us with a number of interesting insights into the beliefs and practices of early Christians. First, we see that Christians regularly met on a certain fixed day for worship. Second, their worship was directed to Christ, demonstrating that they firmly believed in His divinity. Furthermore, one scholar interprets Pliny\u2019s statement that hymns were sung to Christ, as to a god, as a reference to the rather distinctive fact that, \u201cunlike other gods who were worshipped, Christ was a person who had lived on earth.\u201d{11} If this interpretation is correct, Pliny understood that Christians were worshipping an actual historical person as God! Of course, this agrees perfectly with the New Testament doctrine that Jesus was both God and man. Not only does Pliny\u2019s letter help us understand what early Christians believed about Jesus\u2019 person, it also reveals the high esteem to which they held His teachings. For instance, Pliny notes that Christians bound themselves by a solemn oath not to violate various moral standards, which find their source in the ethical teachings of Jesus. In addition, Pliny\u2019s reference to the Christian custom of sharing a common meal likely alludes to their observance of communion and the \u201clove feast.\u201d{12} This interpretation helps explain the Christian claim that the meal was merely food of an ordinary and innocent kind. They were attempting to counter the charge, sometimes made by non-Christians, of practicing \u201critual cannibalism.\u201d{13} The Christians of that day humbly repudiated such slanderous attacks on Jesus\u2019 teachings. We must sometimes do the same today. Evidence from Josephus Perhaps the most remarkable reference to Jesus outside the Bible can be found in the writings of Josephus, a first century Jewish historian. On two occasions, in his Jewish Antiquities, he mentions Jesus. The second, less revealing, reference describes the condemnation of one \u201cJames\u201d by the Jewish Sanhedrin. This James, says Josephus, was \u201cthe brother of Jesus the so-called Christ.\u201d{14} F.F. Bruce points out how this agrees with Paul\u2019s description of James in Galatians 1:19 as \u201cthe Lord\u2019s brother.\u201d{15} And Edwin Yamauchi informs us that \u201cfew scholars have questioned\u201d that Josephus actually penned this passage.{16} As interesting as this brief reference is, there is an earlier one, which is truly astonishing. Called the \u201cTestimonium Flavianum,\u201d the relevant portion declares: About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he . . . wrought surprising feats. . . . He was the Christ. When Pilate . . .condemned him to be crucified, those who had . . . come to love him did not give up their affection for him. On the third day he appeared . . . restored to life. . . . And the tribe of Christians . . . has . . . not disappeared.{17} Did Josephus really write this? Most scholars think the core of the passage originated with Josephus, but that it was later altered by a Christian editor, possibly between the third and fourth century A.D.{18} But why do they think it was altered? Josephus was not a Christian, and it is difficult to believe that anyone but a Christian would have made some of these statements.{19} For instance, the claim that Jesus was a wise man seems authentic, but the qualifying phrase, \u201cif indeed one ought to call him a man,\u201d is suspect. It implies that Jesus was more than human, and it is quite unlikely that Josephus would have said that! It is also difficult to believe he would have flatly asserted that Jesus was the Christ, especially when he later refers to Jesus as \u201cthe so-called\u201d Christ. Finally, the claim that on the third day Jesus appeared to His disciples restored to life, inasmuch as it affirms Jesus\u2019 resurrection, is quite unlikely to come from a non-Christian! But even if we disregard the questionable parts of this passage, we are still left with a good deal of corroborating information about the biblical Jesus. We read that he was a wise man who performed surprising feats. And although He was crucified under Pilate, His followers continued their discipleship and became known as Christians. When we combine these statements with Josephus\u2019 later reference to Jesus as \u201cthe so-called Christ,\u201d a rather detailed picture emerges which harmonizes quite well with the biblical record. It increasingly appears that the \u201cbiblical Jesus\u201d and the \u201chistorical Jesus\u201d are one and the same! Evidence from the Babylonian Talmud There are only a few clear references to Jesus in the Babylonian Talmud, a collection of Jewish rabbinical writings compiled between approximately A.D. 70-500. Given this time frame, it is naturally supposed that earlier references to Jesus are more likely to be historically reliable than later ones. In the case of the Talmud, the earliest period of compilation occurred between A.D. 70-200.{20} The most significant reference to Jesus from this period states: On the eve of the Passover Yeshu was hanged. For forty days before the execution took place, a herald . . . cried, \u201cHe is going forth to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to apostasy.\u201d{21} Let\u2019s examine this passage. You may have noticed that it refers to someone named \u201cYeshu.\u201d So why do we think this is Jesus? Actually, \u201cYeshu\u201d (or \u201cYeshua\u201d) is how Jesus\u2019 name is pronounced in Hebrew. But what does the passage mean by saying that Jesus \u201cwas hanged\u201d? Doesn\u2019t the New Testament say he was crucified? Indeed it does. But the term \u201changed\u201d can function as a synonym for \u201ccrucified.\u201d For instance, Galatians 3:13 declares that Christ was \u201changed\u201d, and Luke 23:39 applies this term to the criminals who were crucified with Jesus.{22} So the Talmud declares that Jesus was crucified on the eve of Passover. But what of the cry of the herald that Jesus was to be stoned? This may simply indicate what the Jewish leaders were planning to do.{23} If so, Roman involvement changed their plans!{24} The passage also tells us why Jesus was crucified. It claims He practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to apostasy! Since this accusation comes from a rather hostile source, we should not be too surprised if Jesus is described somewhat differently than in the New Testament. But if we make allowances for this, what might such charges imply about Jesus? Interestingly, both accusations have close parallels in the canonical gospels. For instance, the charge of sorcery is similar to the Pharisees\u2019 accusation that Jesus cast out demons \u201cby Beelzebul the ruler of the demons.\u201d{25} But notice this: such a charge actually tends to confirm the New Testament claim that Jesus performed miraculous feats. Apparently Jesus\u2019 miracles were too well attested to deny. The only alternative was to ascribe them to sorcery! Likewise, the charge of enticing Israel to apostasy parallels Luke\u2019s account of the Jewish leaders who accused Jesus of misleading the nation with his teaching.{26} Such a charge tends to corroborate the New Testament record of Jesus\u2019 powerful teaching ministry. Thus, if read carefully, this passage from the Talmud confirms much of our knowledge about Jesus from the New Testament. Evidence from Lucian Lucian of Samosata was a second century Greek satirist. In one of his works, he wrote of the early Christians as follows: The Christians . . . worship a man to this day\u2013the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account. . . . [It] was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified sage, and live after his laws.{27} Although Lucian is jesting here at the early Christians, he does make some significant comments about their founder. For instance, he says the Christians worshipped a man, \u201cwho introduced their novel rites.\u201d And though this man\u2019s followers clearly thought quite highly of Him, He so angered many of His contemporaries with His teaching that He \u201cwas crucified on that account.\u201d Although Lucian does not mention his name, he is clearly referring to Jesus. But what did Jesus teach to arouse such wrath? According to Lucian, he taught that all men are brothers from the moment of their conversion. That\u2019s harmless enough. But what did this conversion involve? It involved denying the Greek gods, worshipping Jesus, and living according to His teachings. It\u2019s not too difficult to imagine someone being killed for teaching that. Though Lucian doesn\u2019t say so explicitly, the Christian denial of other gods combined with their worship of Jesus implies the belief that Jesus was more than human. Since they denied other gods in order to worship Him, they apparently thought Jesus a greater God than any that Greece had to offer! Let\u2019s summarize what we\u2019ve learned about Jesus from this examination of ancient non-Christian sources. First, both Josephus and Lucian indicate that Jesus was regarded as wise. Second, Pliny, the Talmud, and Lucian imply He was a powerful and revered teacher. Third, both Josephus and the Talmud indicate He performed miraculous feats. Fourth, Tacitus, Josephus, the Talmud, and Lucian all mention that He was crucified. Tacitus and Josephus say this occurred under Pontius Pilate. And the Talmud declares it happened on the eve of Passover. Fifth, there are possible references to the Christian belief in Jesus\u2019 resurrection in both Tacitus and Josephus. Sixth, Josephus records that Jesus\u2019 followers believed He was the Christ, or Messiah. And finally, both Pliny and Lucian indicate that Christians worshipped Jesus as God! I hope you see how this small selection of ancient non-Christian sources helps corroborate our knowledge of Jesus from the gospels. Of course, there are many ancient Christian sources of information about Jesus as well. But since the historical reliability of the canonical gospels is so well established, I invite you to read those for an authoritative \u201clife of Jesus!\u201d ",
