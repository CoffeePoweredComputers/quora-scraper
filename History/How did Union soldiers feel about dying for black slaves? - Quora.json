            "answer_text": "I doubt they were happy about dying, no matter the reason. However, I\u2019m sure their comrades, friends and family took comfort in knowing that dying to make men free (to quote possibly the war\u2019s most popular song) is a much better reason than dying to keep people as slaves.  In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me.As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,While God is marching on. Here\u2019s part of another popular song of the war: We are springing to the call of our brothers gone before,Shouting the battle cry of freedom!And we'll fill the vacant ranks with a million freemen more,Shouting the battlecry of freedom! CHORUSThe Union forever! Hurrah, boys, hurrah!Down with the traitor, up with the star;While we rally round the flag, boys, we rally once again,Shouting the battle cry of freedom! We will welcome to our numbers the loyal, true and brave,Shouting the battle cry of freedom!And although they may be poor, not a man shall be a slave,Shouting the battle cry of freedom! Written in 1862, it sold 700,000 copies of sheet music, and Lincoln made it his campaign song for the 1864 election. Seems to me that soldiers who march into battle singing songs like those do, in fact, care about ending slavery. A couple more: John Brown was John the Baptist of the Christ we are to see,Christ who of the bondmen shall the Liberator be,And soon throughout the Sunny South the slaves shall all be free,For his soul is marching on! and Hurrah! Hurrah! we bring the Jubilee!Hurrah! Hurrah! the flag that makes you free!So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the seaWhile we were marching through Georgia. There definitely seems to be a common theme here\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Can we remember that 10% of the Union army was black? That\u2019s 180,000 soldiers, and they at least, probably died feeling triumphant. Abolitionist sentiment was strong in the North., It was not a majority, but is was not a tiny minority, either. Some Union troops would have seen themselves as Christian crusaders for freedom. John Brown\u2019s Body was one of the most popular songs in the Union armies\u2014about a man hanged for treason by the state of Virginia for his raid on Harper\u2019s Ferry and attempt to start a slave rebellion. Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, the novel, sold huge numbers of copies in the North\u2014in the book, Uncle Tom was a Christian martyr to Southern brutality. As Union armies moved deeper into the South, the crusading mentality deepened. Most Union soldiers remained racist, of course. But in terms of the South, slaves were legally the same as hogs, mules and cattle. Union soldiers seem to generally have seen black people as human. ",

Why die for Danzig or Paris, after all? Why die for some slave and, in the process, kill your own countrymen? This isn\u2019t 2020 where everyone\u2019s a moral crusader, after all, this is 1861\u20132; most people are lucky if their farm is doing well\u2026and they\u2019re sending off some of their best farm workers to the war. However, as the war ground on, both the notion of defeating the traitorous south and fighting for the blacks became more popular. Why? Part of it was Lincoln\u2019s motivating of the Union\u2019s armies. Another part was that many of them were exposed to blacks. Grateful blacks happy to be freed, and black soldiers joining their units who fought just as bravely as anyone else, despite being of \u2018inferior stock\u2019 (polite versions of the words of the time, not my own words). Sure, there were those that would be racist to their last day on earth, and many only fought because reuniting the Union was the important part of the Civil War, but many realized that they were just dealing with people who looked different than them.

That doesn\u2019t mean that the primary motivation of the the Union was to abolish slavery. Thats a false inference. The primary motivation of the union was to maintain the integrity and sovereignty of the United States of America. as to what the average soldier felt? Obviously the African American ones had some investment in it. A large proportion of recruits were often enlisted right of the boat, and the prospect of being fed and paid fairly regularly was a big incentive. As to others, while they wrre probably racist as hell by modern standards, the north had been free of slavery for half a century, and by then found the notion both distasteful and unnecessary. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read a lot of Civil War literature. It\u2019s my impression, as an armchair historian, that most of the Yankee soldiers weren\u2019t primarily motivated by hatred of slavery, or love of black people. They were more, in my own opinion, on average, motivated by other factors such as love of country, camaraderie with their fellow soldiers, belief in their leaders once they had good generals ( which they did not early in the war) and just general belligerence towards anybody who would oppose them and the might of their country. The fight, from the common soldier\u2019s pov, as I see it, was more like a good boy beating up a bad boy for picking on a little kid. The good boy may not love or even like the little kid, but he may hate the bully and therefore want to whip the bully. It\u2019s really complicated and I\u2019m struggling for words. The war itself was about slavery, first and foremost, but in the eyes of the men fighting it, it was sometimes or often as much or more about their own rights and beliefs. People take sides in every kind of situation because they LIKE or dislike the people on the other side of the issue. So if a young man knew and liked other young men who believed in slavery, he probably joined up in the South, where as if he liked other men who believed in freedom, Yankee work habits, etc, he probably joined up with the North.

People in those days were raised with a sense of their Christian duty which sounds foreign to us now, but was very real for them. Slavery had been slowly growing unpopular in most of England and the Northern part of the U.S., and most Protestants preachers in the north preached against it frequently. People had become used to seeing slavery as the horrible institution it was, and they greatly pitied those men and women who were forced to endure life as slaves. So many, if not most, Union soldiers were ready to fight the Confederacy and free the slaves; they thought it no less than their Christian Duty. ",
