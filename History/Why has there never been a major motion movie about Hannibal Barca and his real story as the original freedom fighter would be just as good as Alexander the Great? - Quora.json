            "answer_text": "Personally\u2026I don\u2019t think Hannibal Barca could really be considered the \u201coriginal freedom fighter\u201d as he was just as much in favor of Carthaginian imperialism as the Romans were for their Roman imperialism. Both nations sought to rule over other lands. Carthage ruled over much of Spain long before the Romans got there\u2026and Roman rule over that peninsula generally came about by defeating the Carthaginians and replacing Punic rule with their own\u2026although it was not until the reign of Augustus Caesar that the Roman rule over Spain was finally consolidated. The only \u201cfreedom\u201d Hannibal sought was freedom from rule by the Romans\u2026but he had no objection to his own city, Carthage, ruling over others. Hardly a \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d! Considering how much of what is called \u201cWestern Civilization\u201d is ultimately derived from Roman precedents and how different it would have been had the Carthaginians been victorious\u2026it is probably fortuitous that the war between Rome and Carthage ended the way it did\u2026with a Carthaginian defeat, otherwise our world would be very different\u2026and not really better at all.

            "answer_text": "Well it definitely is a great story full of drama and action. However, if Hannibal is your hero the story has an anti-climactic ending. Hannibal\u2019s father had fought the Romans in the previous war which sets up his life\u2019s ambition to destroy Rome. It\u2019s not so much a story of liberation as it is about two rival powers fighting for influence. Hannibal did not have the full backing of his government which adds to this idea of a rebel, and a great element of political conflict. Ultimately his \u2018hero\u2019s quest\u2019 fails, after a sting of victories, arriving at his goal and just not having the force or power to see it through. This war was waged over many years and in different styles. Ultimately it ends with Hannibal retreating and being defeated at home. His city and it\u2019s empire crumbles. The war was fought in Spain, Italy, North Africa and the Mediterranean Islands over years and years. I think it\u2019s a difficult story to tell and, again, the hero ends up defeated, exiled to Greece with his home destroyed. If this story gets told, it also needs to include Scipio Africanus who defeats him, avenging his father, uncle and all the Romans lost during the war. Probably and easier story to tell. History is written by the winners. Had Hannibal won, he would be the hero of the story. As it stands, his story is more like a Shakespearean tragedy where his zeal is his hamartia which gains him victories but ultimately leads to his defeat, over extended with no way to win. Would definitely watch this movie/series though. ",
