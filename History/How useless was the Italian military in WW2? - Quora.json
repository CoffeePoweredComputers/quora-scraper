            "answer_text": "Much is made of how O\u2019Connor and his \u201836000\u2019 destroyed an Italian army that outnumbered them by more than five to one, and captured over 130,000 Italian soldiers. However it is a mistake to make a judgement on the quality of the army based on the outcome of the campaign. Operation Compass was a decisive victory, but it was not a walkover and certainly not a foregone conclusion. Several facts are crucial: the Commonwealth Infantry was motorised and the Italian Infantry was not. Also the British used their tanks as a \u2018blitzkrieg\u2019 force; the 7th Armoured Division outflanked the Italians several times and finally cut off their line of retreat at Beda Fomm. The Italians had plenty of tanks (420 Italian tanks and self propelled guns were destroyed or captured) and these were not appreciably worse than most of the British tanks of that campaign, (excluding the Matildas obviously). However they were they were thinly spread across the army in infantry support role. The Italian army in 1940 was not low on morale or willingness to fight. (2 of the divisions in Libya were fascist \u2018Blackshirts\u2019). There was some fairly stiff fighting but the Italian army was out-maneuvered, put out of supply and ultimately \u2018out-generaled\u2019. Later in the Desert War Italian morale and willingness to fight were compromised, however the bulk of Rommel\u2019s army was Italian and he managed to use the Infantry well in a static role whilst the Afrika Corps and the Italian \u2018Ariete\u2019 Armoured Division acted as his strike force. The Italian artillery was fairly good and was probably the best part of the army. The engineers were good too and excelled at booby traps. They did also have some very good infantry units, such as the Alpini, but these were worn down and destroyed in the vicious winter war of 1940/41 in Greece. To conclude it suited our propaganda to portray the Italians as being useless, but the reality is a little more complex than that. ",

            "answer_text": "Italy was in short pretty fucked. Their army sucked. Their guns were shit (ex. Breda Modello 30 LMG and the Carcano, a rifle that was by that time inferior). They had a small tank force, but their tanks were laughable. Almost completely ineffective, and some of the more competent designs were either too scarcely produced or were implemented too late. Their air force was\u2026 alright. Not as bad as some people give it credit for, in fact some of their fighter designs were remarked on as being among the best the axis had to provide. The S.M. 79 is considered to have been one of the best medium bombers ever made, and often is considered the best torpedo bomber of the war. Unfortunately, they also fielded several obsolete designs that were more common in combat and as a result the Regia Aeronautica was never that effective. Their navy was probably their best asset. They had a navy considerably larger than Germany's, and with many of the best designs of their day. But they had one critical downfall: no radar. And confronting the radar equipped Royal Navy at night proved to be disastrous for them. Most of the Italian Navy, and particularly their capital ships, ended up simply being Tirpitz'd in port as well. Tl;dr: The Italian Military was decent, but horrific planning and a shitty army led to their collapse. ",
