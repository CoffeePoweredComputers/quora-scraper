            "answer_text": "So called ARISTOCRATS, the Greek word that means ruling of the society, governing it by the EXCELLENT, but since these people are by no means excellent, but only FILTHY ICH, they should be called, instead, PLUTOCRATS, which means that the richest rule the society, as is the case. PLUTOS in Greek means riches, while KRATOS means state. \u2018\u2019ARISTOCRATS\u2019, i.e, PLUTOCRATS ARE NOT IMPORTANT AT ALL AND YET THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY RULE WITH THEIR MONEY, BC MONEY CAN BUY ALMOST ANYTHING. WOLFGANG AMADEYS MOZART was an EXCELLENT person, but he ruled no one, while DONALD TRUMP is a tramp, but rules America and thus the planet because he is FILTHY RICH. ",

            "answer_text": "They are the descents of people who did something important for the King. They were rewarded by giving them a business advantage (land in those days) in return of course for support for him, especially in war. Their descents parlayed that feudal business of living off of others into some system where they cannot recall how they got there and tell themselves God must have done it and they can sit on their asses and feel superior. Why are they important now? They parlayed their advantages monetarily, educationally and socially so that they have an unjustified share of the economy and say in it\u2019s direction which is generally toward them.
