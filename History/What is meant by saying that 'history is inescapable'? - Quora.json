Look at the Pandemic-it\u2019s an era in history that you\u2019ll hopefully survive and maybe if you\u2019re young enough be able to tell about it to your grandchildren. The last pandemic before this, the Spanish Flu was nearly 100 years ago. This was basically inescapable. So were WW I, WW II, the Korean Conflict and the Vietnam War.

That's one of the things wrong with history.\u201d\u2015 Clarence Darrow Adam Michnik \"[holds a] core... belief... that history is not just about the past because it is constantly recurring, and not as farce, as Marx had it, but as itself: The world is full of inquisitors and heretics, liars and those lied to, terrorists and the terrorized. There is still someone dying at Thermopylae, someone drinking a glass of hemlock, someone crossing the Rubicon, someone drawing up a proscription list.\" Adam Michnik ",
