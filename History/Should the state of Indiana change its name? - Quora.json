            "answer_text": "Should Indiana change its name? When you consider the history of Indiana, this is a valid question. Indiana was originally named \u201cIndiana\u201d by European settlers on the east cost when it was the \u201cfrontier\u201d where the Native Americans lived. It was officially named \u201cIndiana\u201d by US Congress in 1800 when the Northwest territory was divided up. When those settlers moved westward into the Indiana area, they forcefully relocated the Indians out, beginning in 1830. Particularly horrible was the Pottawatomie Trail of Death in 1838, when this tribe was marched out of Indiana and into Kansas. In 1846, most of the Miami tribe were moved out as well. The only Native Americans allowed to remain in Indiana were the small Pokagon band (in NW Indiana) and a few of the Miami who owned land. Considering how the Native Americans of the Indiana area were expelled, it is strange that the state still bears the name \u201cIndiana\u201d. The capitol, Indianapolis, ie, \u201ccity of the Indians\u201d was originally home to a group of Lanape (Delaware) who had been forced out of their homes in the east. Then they were were also forced to leave Indiana to relocate to Kansas. Indianapolis continues to be called \u201cIndianapolis\u201d and its minor league team \u201cthe Indians\u201d. It would be ironic, if it were not done intentionally. One can ask if perhaps the city of Indianapolis consider a name change as well. But should the name of \u201cIndiana\u201d be changed? On the one hand, keeping the name \u201cIndiana\u201d reminds us that this state is in no uncertain terms a stolen land as most of its original inhabitants were kicked out. On the other hand, what else could the state be named? Hoosierland? West Ohio? How about altering the name from \u201cIndiana\u201d to \u201cIndependence\u201d or just \u201cIndy\u201d? Maybe it could be named after one of its famous inhabitants: President Benjamin Harrison (the state of \u201cHarrison\u201d)Lincoln (he lived there a short time, and naming it \u201cLincoln\u201d would really piss off the people of Illinois)Gus Grissom (Apollo 1 astronaut, \u201cGrissom\u201d)David Letterman (\u201cLand of Letterman\u201d)John Mellencamp (\u201cMellencampland\u201d)Kurt Vonnegut (maybe \u201cVonnegon\u201d, like Oregon)Madam Walker (African American businesswoman, \u201cWalker\u201d)James Whitcomb Riley (a poet, \u201cRiley\u201d)Oscar Charleston (African American baseball hall-of-famer, \u201cCharleston\u201d)Hoagy Carmichael (songwriter, \u201cCarmichael\u201d)Of the above, I think \u201cHarrison\u201d or \u201cRiley\u201d would have the most possible support. There are others, such as James Dean, Larry Bird, Florence Henderson, Steve McQueen, Michael and/or Janice Jackson, Mike Pence, Dan Quayle, Jim Nabors, and Johnny \u201cAppleseed\u201d Chapman, which you could consider, but I don\u2019t think these are viable. Then again, I think the thing Indiana is most famous for isn\u2019t a person, but an event: the \u201cIndy 500\u201d race. So a name related to car racing might be best. I\u2019d vote for the name of \u201cSpeedway\u201d myself. ",

            "answer_text": "I see no problem with the name Indiana which means land of Indians. The real bugaboo name for with Indiana is the term \u201cHoosier.\u201d Even though I grew up in Indiana and have lived there 35 out of 45 years of my life I refuse to call myself a Hoosier. Hoosier has different meanings in Indiana that no one has definitively determined other than some various yokel ideas such the state being named as after Hoosier\u2019s men or \u201cWho\u2019s here\u201d done in a backwoods Indiana southern style hillbilly dialect, etc. Or they call it the Hoosier state which I just find ridiculous. I\u2019d rather be referred as a Indianian or something else at least intelligible rather than some backwoods mentality garbage that came out of some backwoods town 200 years ago that makes the state look like a bunch of wandering hilljack locals. That said and also in St. Louis slang a Hoosier is basically nothing but white trash which is another thing that occurred in the 1900s when Indiana workers went to St. Louis and East St. Louis to break strikes of the local unions protesting lousy working conditions there. So there you have it what a Hoosier truly is and I\u2019ve never been white trash nor associated with that type of subclass of people. Indiana needs to ditch the Hoosier moniker. ",
