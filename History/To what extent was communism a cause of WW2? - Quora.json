            "answer_text": "One of the tropes I hate seeing in movies or TV shows is when the Bad Guy kills someone because the Good Guy did not do something, then the Good Guy laments that the death is THEIR fault, not the fault of the person who killed them. I know that it\u2019s both a reflection of the rigid moral compass needed to be a Good Guy, as well as a natural instinct for some to take responsibility for situations they could not possibly have affected if they feel somehow involved\u2026 but you\u2019d think that people so involved in the actions of Good AND Bad in such a matrix would have dealt with that a long time ago. That\u2019s also the root of this question. Communism itself was NOT a cause of WW2. Nazis hating Communism was. More important than that, Nazis from Germany wanting to invade Russia for their resources, and effectively starve the \u201cinferior\u201d Russian people to death while expanding the German people to fill all that land. The Nazis used Communism as an excuse to villainize Russia, and enact their extremist plan. The Communists had their own issues. And Stalinism \u2014 which, despite its mischaracterization by many on BOTH sides, was effectively Despotism dressed in Red mouthing Communist rhetoric to justify itself \u2014 had TONS of issues stemming from its own addiction to power. But to blame the Communists for \u201cmaking Germany angry\u201d is like blaming the new kid for getting beat up for being new because it \u201ctaunted\u201d the bullies. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends what part you\u2019re talking about. It didn\u2019t have anything to do with Japan in China. It didn\u2019t have anything to do with Germany annexing Austria, or going into Czechoslovakia or Poland, or Belgium, or France. It\u2019s hard to say if going further east was motivated by Soviet Communism, or hatred of ethnic Slavs. Going back, it\u2019s not clear that the rise of the NSDAP was anti-communist or just right wing reactionary anti-liberal anything. This is not to say that Hitler didn\u2019t spend a lot of vitriol against the Communists. It\u2019s more that he may have been saying similar things against anybody to the left of Bismarck. ",
