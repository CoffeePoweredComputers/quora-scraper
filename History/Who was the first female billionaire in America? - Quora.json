            "answer_text": "Is that a billionaire adjusted for inflation or not adjusted for inflation. I would say if you adjust for inflation Marjorie Merriweather Post (March 15, 1887 \u2013 September 12, 1973) was an American businesswoman, socialite, philanthropist and owner of General Foods, Inc. She used much of her fortune to collect art, particularly pre-revolutionary Russian art, much of which is now on display at Hillwood, the museum which was her estate in Washington, D.C. She is also known for her mansion, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida, which following her death eventually became a resort owned by US President Donald Trump. If you want to only count self made billionaires and don\u2019t adjust for inflation then Martha Stewart wins the crown. As far as richest female billionaires then Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers of L\u2019Oriel fame and Alice Walton seem to split the lead depending on the source but both seem to be around 54 billion.
