            "answer_text": "By definition, yes. The Old Testament, the Jewish Scriptures, tell the history of God\u2019s interactions with the people of Israel as He prepared to fulfill His promise to send a Messiah to save humanity from the consequences of Adam\u2019s rebellion. Israel was the chosen instrument through which the Messiah would come, as a descendent of Abraham through King David. The New Testament is the history of the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of that Messiah: Jesus of Nazareth. It is also a history of the early first-century Church founded by Jesus and His students and a collection of letters containing explanations, warnings, and instructions from the Apostles to congregations that they founded. Christians adopted the Old Testament Scriptures wholesale without changes because Jesus referred to them as being inspired by God and His Words. ",

            "answer_text": "That is true of the Christian Bible, but not of the Jewish Bible, which is called Tanakh. Contrary to popular misconception, the Tanakh and the \u201cOld Testament\u201d* are not the same thing; aside from the fact that overlapping texts are translated and interpreted quite differently between the two, the \u201cOld Testament\u201d includes some texts that are not part of the Tanakh. That being said, they are mostly the same, at least when it comes to the original Hebrew text and ignores differences in interpretation. *Jews generally do not use the term \u201cOld Testament\u201d as that implies that the text no longer applies, that it has been replaced, or that there is a \u201cNew\u201d one\u2026 all Christian beliefs that are rejected by Judaism.
