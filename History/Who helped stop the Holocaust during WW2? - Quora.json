            "answer_text": "The Holocaust continued until almost the last minute. It was stopped by British, Russian, and American soldiers who liberated the camps. The German guards would often leave shortly before the Allied troops arrived with all prisoners who were able to walk. These forced marches resulted in countless deaths of exhausted, starved prisoners. If the guards stayed outraged soldiers were known to execute them. The Ohrdruf camp was a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp, and the first Nazi camp liberated by US troops. Created in November 1944 near the town of Gotha, Germany, Ohrdruf supplied forced labor in the form of concentration camp prisoners for railway construction leading to a proposed communications center, which was never completed due to the rapid American advance. In late March 1945, the camp had a prisoner population of some 11,700, but in early April the SS evacuated almost all the prisoners on death marches to Buchenwald. The SS guards killed many of the remaining prisoners who were too ill to walk to the railcars. When the soldiers of the 4th Armored Division entered the camp, they discovered piles of bodies, some covered with lime, and others partially incinerated on pyres. The ghastly nature of their discovery led General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe, to visit the camp on April 12, with Generals George S. Patton and Omar Bradley. After his visit, Eisenhower cabled General George C. Marshall, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, describing his trip to Ohrdruf: . . .the most interesting\u2014although horrible\u2014sight that I encountered during the trip was a visit to a German internment camp near Gotha. The things I saw beggar description. While I was touring the camp I encountered three men who had been inmates and by one ruse or another had made their escape. I interviewed them through an interpreter. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to \u201cpropaganda.\u201d Seeing the Nazi crimes committed at Ohrdruf made a powerful impact on Eisenhower, and he wanted the world to know what happened in the concentration camps. On April 19, 1945, he again cabled Marshall with a request to bring members of Congress and journalists to the newly liberated camps so that they could bring the horrible truth about Nazi atrocities to the American public. He wrote: We continue to uncover German concentration camps for political prisoners in which conditions of indescribable horror prevail. I have visited one of these myself and I assure you that whatever has been printed on them to date has been understatement. If you could see any advantage in asking about a dozen leaders of Congress and a dozen prominent editors to make a short visit to this theater in a couple of C-54's, I will arrange to have them conducted to one of these places where the evidence of bestiality and cruelty is so overpowering as to leave no doubt in their minds about the normal practices of the Germans in these camps. I am hopeful that some British individuals in similar categories will visit the northern area to witness similar evidence of atrocity. That same day, Marshall received permission from the Secretary of War, Henry Lewis Stimson, and President Harry S. Truman for these delegations to visit the liberated camps. Ohrdruf made a powerful impression on General George S. Patton as well. He described it as \u201cone of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen.\u201d He recounted in his diary that In a shed . . . was a pile of about 40 completely naked human bodies in the last stages of emaciation. These bodies were lightly sprinkled with lime, not for the purposes of destroying them, but for the purpose of removing the stench. When the shed was full\u2014I presume its capacity to be about 200, the bodies were taken to a pit a mile from the camp where they were buried. The inmates claimed that 3,000 men, who had been either shot in the head or who had died of starvation, had been so buried since the 1st of January. When we began to approach with our troops, the Germans thought it expedient to remove the evidence of their crime. Therefore, they had some of the slaves exhume the bodies and place them on a mammoth griddle composed of 60-centimeter railway tracks laid on brick foundations. They poured pitch on the bodies and then built a fire of pinewood and coal under them. They were not very successful in their operations because there was a pile of human bones, skulls, charred torsos on or under the griddle which must have accounted for many hundreds. Ohrdruf  Buchenwald Anticipating Holocaust Denial Eisenhower insisted on extensive documentation and had photos and film released to the public in order to get the news out as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Films were even shown to POWs and local German citizens forced to tour the camps and even help with cleaning them up and reburying victims. Eisenhower\u2019s concerns about widespread denial was prophetic.  Eisenhower said if he hadn\u2019t seen it for himself he wouldn\u2019t have believed it.  German civilians forced to see for themselves  POWs in America  Dachau liberation  British liberate then burn Bergen-Belsen to the ground. This is the camp Anne Frank died in.

            "answer_text": "People were not willing to believe these things or they turned a blind eye for self serving ends. US had a strict policy of military objectives FIRST and no interference with military strategy.Both Roosevelt and Eisenhower were not wiling change this mindset even when they had maps of Auschwitz at their disposal.. they were in a position to bomb the facilities if they chose! The first major effort was made by polish officer Jan Karski. Jan Karski ,was sent on a special mission by exile leader Sikorski. An escaped POW, he was smuggled into Warsaw ghetto to see the state of Jews and also went on to see a transit camp for Belzec(initially he thought he had seen the death camp). He carried his report to London for review by polish govt in exile, British and US. He was granted audience with Roosevelt. Roosevelt didnt ask one question about jews!. A few others said they could not believe him. The evaluation was like \u2018bad things may happen in war but things were exagerrated.\u2019 Only after the liberation of the camps, the horror fully dawned on them that the unbelievable and worst has actually happened. All along the Third reich has been underestimated/misjudged by many from start till finish ,despite several leading clues in the open. Racial purity was the chief goal of the Nazi state. They dedicated resources to the extermination of the Jews till the last moment .People were dying of disease or starvation in places like Bergen Belsen even after liberation.Prisoners were shot before evacuation of camps. As allies advanced closer, they executed or took inmates on death marches. ",
