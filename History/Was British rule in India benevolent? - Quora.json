If: a smart, savvy man knocked on your door,made obeisance and requested a room to live in, flattered you and gave you gifts, gained your trust and bribed your friends away, then started giving you counsel on how to run your home; slowly started re-arranging your home, eventually took over your best room, your best linen and best china, and your business and livelihood, took your kids' toys away, and decided what they should and should not learn in school, decided what career they should choose, and then one day, got hold of your bank cards and cheque books and started writing large cheques to himself,spent your money to make his own place bigger, his business better and clothe/feed/educate his family better, built an extension to your house to make his stay more comfortable - with your money, bought new appliances and gadgets, with your money, all of which he kept primarily for his own use, made you and your family work hard to feed his needs, made you dress to please him, talk in his accent to please him, killed your first-born when he dared to protest at the this mistreatment, smartly eliminated further opposition by getting your kids to fight among themselves, played God with you in his moments of expansiveness by 'improving' you, fed you and your family scraps from his table, and put your kids to fighting his battles elsewhere,starved one of your kids to death by stashing your food away behind locked doors, even re-wrote the story of your family so that you never can explain to someone what your life would have been if he hadn't interfered, and, eventually boasted to the world about all the wonderful changes he has brought to your house\u2026how he brought new technology to your home, and how he has taught you to talk/walk/behave more fittingly like him\u2026 Then:  even if other people believed him, would you? and would you call him benevolent?",

            "answer_text": "The British rule in India was not benevolent. But the story is more nuanced than many Indian nationalists believe.    This is a photograph of the Koregaon obelisk. It marks a very important battle in the British war against the Marathas under Peshwa Baji Rao II. In this battle, the 25,000-strong army of the Marathas was routed by 800 East India Company troops. The obelisk was built by the British to mark this victory.  It may come as a surprise to many, but this obelisk and the event it commemorates are celebrated even today - not by the British but by Indians. Why? Because the Company troops were not for the most part British soldiers -- they were Indian soldiers. And not just any Indians, but Dalits -- Mahars -- 'untouchables'. It was the first time in the modern history of India that the 'untouchables' had defeated an army of their oppressors.  It is important for us to understand what exactly historical India was like for the poorest of the poor. While the educated, professional classes were fighting for freedom from the British, a much larger section of the Indian population -- Dalits, tribals and the lower castes -- were fighting their own freedom struggle. This freedom struggle was not from the British but from the fetters of the Indian caste system; and these fetters were greater than almost any atrocities that the British inflicted on Indians. The lowest castes were not just considered racially inferior -- they were considered sub-human. Any labor of these castes was considered entirely for the profit of the higher castes. These castes constituted 25-50% of India's pre-1947 population. Not only did the atrocities of British imperial rule leave the lowest castes unaffected (so degraded was their condition already); but in many cases, British rule actively helped them in their struggle to their own independence. The Mahars -- the untouchable caste to which Ambedkar belonged -- were entirely, utterly subjugated by Peshwa rule: buried alive to protect secrets, trampled to death by elephants for protesting their condition, denied education, \"playfully\" put to death when the Peshwas felt like it. The Mahars considered the British to be their saviors. The East India Company recruited the Mahars in thousands for their army; and a major landmark in Dalit history is the Battle of Koregaon.   Bhimrao Ambedkar -- in my opinion, the greatest Indian of the last 200 years second only to Mahatma Gandhi -- was a Mahar. When first reading about Ambedkar, it was surprising to me that a man from such a 'backward' caste could go on to do a Ph.D. in Columbia, and achieve the greatness that he did. But Ambedkar's success and rise to fame from his 'untouchable' roots is not only a result of his own personal brilliance (though he was certainly brilliant). No, the story starts several generations before -- for at least 3 generations before him, Mahars served in the British army; Ambedkar's father was a ranked army officer in the Mhow cantonment. That is why he was able to achieve some modicum of education, where his talents shone, and he went from success to success -- this in a community where, only two hundred years before his birth, the education of a Mahar would have meant the execution or excommunication of his entire family. The empowerment of Ambedkar, and of his entire caste, are certainly due in a large part to the 'benevolence' of the British towards his community. By reading Ambedkar, one learns about various movements, rebellions and struggles that were entirely absent from our history education. One such incident is the Mahad Satyagraha. On 20th March 1927, Ambedkar led a group of 3,000 Dalits to the Chavadar Tank in Mahad, to drink a few drops of water and assert their right to use this pool -- a right which had been granted to non-Hindus, animals and caste Hindus, but denied to the Mahars. They had the full backing of the British Government for this Satyagraha; and Ambedkar considers this day the true \"Independence Day\" for Dalits. The Mahad Satyagraha was followed by widespread riots by upper-caste Hindus. Ambedkar even spent a night at a police station. But in June 1927, an unprecedented event happened: 5 upper-caste Hindus were sentenced by the (colonial) magistrate to 4 months' hard imprisonment for violence against Dalits. Ambedkar said: \"Had the chief officers in the district not been British, justice would have been denied. Under Peshwa Rule, I would have been trampled to death by an elephant.\" In my circle of friends, we tend to look at caste issues through the one-dimensional lens of reservations; we are aghast that someone with merit is denied an opportunity because a seat is reserved for someone from another caste. Yet every month in India, Dalit boys are killed for marrying caste Hindu girls; entire political parties have been created for the sole purpose of providing representation to caste Hindus that want to maintain caste hegemony (the foremost in Tamil Nadu being the one led by \"Change, Progress, Anbumani\"); and in the margins of our urban society, Dalits still live in segregated villages and drink water from separate tumblers. So the British rule in India was not benevolent. But India before the British was often evil and oppressive to an even greater degree than British rule was. And it is undeniable that for a certain significant segment of the Indian population, British rule was in fact an Independence of its own.
