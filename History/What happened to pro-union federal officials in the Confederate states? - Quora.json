            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, they fell in with their states, resigning their positions. The outgoing Buchanan administration was Democratic and included many Southerners, such as John C Breckinridge, the Kentuckian Vice President who joined the Confederacy. It was natural that they would leave anyway as Lincoln came into office with his own Republican appointees. There were some exceptions of course. Most notable was Senator Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, who kept his seat, then went on to become military governor of Tennessee, Lincoln\u2019s second Vice President, then President upon Lincoln\u2019s death. CSA President Jefferson Davis had served as a Mississippi Senator and Secretary of War. The major example was the army. Career Southern officers resigned en masse to join the South, leaving a huge leadership hole in the Union army. Almost every major Southern military leader had served in the US Army; many were West Point alumni, starting with Robert E Lee and CSA President Davis. The senior Union officer, General Winfield Scott of Virginia, opted to stay with the Union, as did a handful of other senior officers with Southern roots. Even the greatest Union generals, Grant and Sherman, had Southern ties. Grant\u2019s wife came from a slaveholding family (as did Lincoln\u2019s wife) and Sherman had taught in a Louisiana military academy. ",

            "answer_text": "Some joined the Confederacy anyway. Robert E. Lee is a good example of this. He opposed secession and was a US Army officer. Yet when Virginia seceded he resigned his commission anyway and joined the Confederate Army. Some continued to oppose the Confederacy. Gov. Sam Houston of Texas is a good example of that. Texans simply refused to recognize him as Governor and shunned him after he refused to support joining the Confederacy. Some remained with the Union despite their states. A good example is Andrew Johnson who remained in the US Senate even after his home state of Tennessee seceded. He refused to recognize secession and continued to serve the State as part of the Union.
