            "answer_text": "At least one mini pyramid, using the same stone and the same building techniques was constructed just to prove that this could have been done. Only about a hundred workers were involved. So, with enough money and manpower, yes, we could build the pyramids again, using the same materials and the same techniques as were used in building the originals. I saw all of this, including their moving the stones, full sized stones but a lot less of them, in a documentary on television. Does this documentary still in existence and is it accessible. I do not know, as a lot of what should be available is not on the internet. In fact nothing is on the net unless someone posts it, meaning that the internet may not be the best source for researching anything. ",

            "answer_text": "No, which is why it hasn\u2019t been done. There\u2019s a picture of a pyramid in Las Vegas from a previous poster LOL. The Giza Pyramid was constructed with over 2,000,000 blocks, each weighing several tons. Many of the blocks had to be lifted several meters high. The Japanese tried to duplicate the great pyramid in the late 70s and failed. Even if the pyramid could be duplicated using our current technology, it would take an extraordinary long time. Here\u2019s a link to the Japanese effort. Astro Black It\u2019s true that 1978 was a over 40 years ago, but even today in 2019, I do not think we could build a pyramid with the precision and materials used. Whoever built the great pyramid was better than us in at least the area of engineering mathematics. ",

One serves as a hotel and a casino - Luxor Las Vegas - standing at 111m, it's roughly 35m shy of the Great (Khufu's) Pyramid at Giza at it's highest. The scene is complete with a replica of the Great Sphinx of a Giza, and an obelisk.    Another one that was once a basketball court - Pyramid Arena. Smaller than the Las Vegas casino, this Great American Pyramid stands at 98m in Memphis, Tennessee.  You can find more such modern pyramids here: Pyramid ",

Nothing special about them as to construction, anymore than aqueducts the Romans built that still stand today. Hard work is what it took. Consider that they were built over many centuries, not at one short period of time. IN addition a small 20ft high one was built using the basic equipment as a test.
