            "answer_text": "The Imperium is the strongest faction in the universe. I think that is what the lore try to imply. However they are only strong enough to be undefeated by a myrid of horrors in this grimdark galaxy but not strong enough to deal with any of them decisively which result in a millenniums long stalemate that send them into a slow, painful decline. The Imperium can deal (and have dealth with) with any of the threat they faced at current stage in lore. They defeat nearly every Tyranid invasion, including the largest, most apocalyptic fleet that had long implied to bring the end to the universe - the Leviathan. Honestly I think people here give the Nid far more credit than it deserve. The thing about 40k lore is that the part where something is described as invincible is only meant to be an impression of how powerful the faction but not the way they actually function. Tyranid has been losing every engagement by far and GW writer even admit that they will never win so that's that, their actual power level is not meant to be greater than any other faction in the setting. The rest of the factions are made it so that \u201cthey can beat x if y conditons are met) The Orkz are implied to be the strongest but only if they manage to unite under one capable leader which is not happening yet. The Necron are terrifyingly advanced but they are few in number, they don't have that many tomb awoken and most are boundee by their own interest not to unleashe to full might of their technology to destroy the universe. At their current stage, the Imperium had defeated them time and again. Even a single ship from the Mechanicum Explorer fleet had defeated the entire Necron Tomb World - think of that The Eldar are in even longer decline than the Imerium, their numbers are fee and they lost many of their doomsday artefact a long time ago. They neiher have the resource nor the will to face Imperium directly. Chaos has been trying yo destroy the Imperium for 10,000 years. So far that ended in failure of various degree. And that's in the best case scenario. Tau has has less worlds than Ultramar alone and lack advanced FTL capability which is absolutely need to even go near the major spot in the Imperium (and yes, the space nazi rape their rear in a regular basic.) None of the factions are strong enough to dethrone the Imperium as the sole master of the stars, yet none of them can be completely defeated either (at least until the End Time) as a result we are stuck in the state of grimdark and stagnation And that is the best setting for current state of the galaxy so I don't think that will change any time soon as well.

            "answer_text": "Relative to the rest of the factions, it is a middling power. It used to be strong, and this was the Great Crusade-era Imperium, when the Emperor was active and his twenty sons and Legions were fighting for humanity. Compared to the Orks, it is a fluctating scale. It depends on which Ork civilization it is fighting. Most of the time, the Orks are weaker and can be handled. But when a WAAAGH! happens, the Ork teknologikal might can exceed the Imperium\u2019s own stagnating technology, to say nothing of its armies and fleets. Next to the Necrons, the Imperium is outclassed. The humanity of the Dark Age of Technology might have been considered their equals, but that is a leap of logic to assume. Next to the Eldar, the Imperium is superior, and not because of technology but because of numbers. Where there is a Craftworld, the Imperium has a thousand Forge Worlds and billions upon billions of Guardsmen to match it, as well as two or more full-strength Space Marine Chapters (an exaggeration, I know). Next to the Tyranids\u2026 everyone is outclassed. Next to Chaos, the Imperium is mighty but only in physical space. Chaos\u2019 strength lies in moral corruption and spiritual destruction. Next to the Tau, the Imperium is still a mighty entity that can crush it should it decide they are worth more the effort to destroy than just a Crusade or two \u2014 but they can advance in technology compared to the Imperium, and can match their soldiers on the battlefield, and the moment they can find a FTL drive that does not use the Warp, they will exceed the Imperium. Next to the Dark Eldar, the Imperium is\u2026 well, the Imperium is a large beast to be prodded and tickled. Sure, mighty and powerful, but subject to Deldar machinations. ",
