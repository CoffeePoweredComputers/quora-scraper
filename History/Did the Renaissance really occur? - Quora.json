            "answer_text": "The Renaissance is a an outdated but convenient term to periodize history. It is only to a certain extent correct, and not very accurate at that. As the name for an epoch, I\u2019d say it is even more confusing than helpful. Not one, but many renaissances did occur, with various degree of success. Actually, renaissances should be viewed as a phenomena in history, especially in the fields of art and philosophy. The attempts to revitalize Greek and Roman art and thinking occured started in France, at the court of Charlemagne in the 8th and 9th century. Similar renaissances occured throughout the middle ages and beyond. In fact, the very term medieval renaissance is being used, isn\u2019t that contradictory? Generally, a rebirth of Ancient Greece and Rome in one\u2019s own time is for the purpose of elevate the present culture with \u201cthe glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome\u201d. It didn\u2019t start with the 14th century, and it didn\u2019t end then. The United States, for example, can be viewed as a successor to Roman ideals and ideas. Even in antiquity itself, there were movements do reinstate the past. The term \u201crenaissance\u201d was concieved by french historian Jules Michelet in 1855. If that sounds outdated, it is because it is. The concept of the Renaissance reflects the whole narrative of Europe being wonderfully enlightened by europeans after the terrible, terrible dark ages. Today, we know that the so called dark ages weren\u2019t very dark at all compared to other epochs, and the rise of wealth and urbanized culture in Europe depended on arabic, ottoman and indian influences as well as european efforts. The idea that Europe all of a sudden rediscovered Antiquity is all to easy (and by the way also euro-centric), looking into the fact that medieval culture itself was heavily influenced by Greek filosophers such as Plato and Aristotle (yes, he was read and studied from the 11th century, by Christian scholars, well inside the medieval period). There is also a huge problem with the boundaries of the period, especially concerning literature. Renaissance is supposed to be a reaction against the medieval traditions and views, right? And the middle ages end about 1450\u20131500? That places several of the most profilic figures of the italian renaissance in the middle ages (Dante Alighieri 1265 \u2013 1321, Boccaccio 1313\u20131375, Petrarch 1304\u20131374). That is a long time apart from the french classicists of the 17th century, who actually were trying to write plays according to the poetics of Aristotle. And how much did they share? According to the common view of the Renaissance, it was supposed to give rebirth to classic ideals and thoughts. In art and architecture, it\u2019s easy to see that the artists tried to do just that. But in literature, it\u2019s much harder to even get a good explanation of what those ideas och ideals were. It\u2019s also a struggle to see that Dante, Cervantes, Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re are all part of some great literary movement. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, those guys really started something new, but were they a movement like the authors of the Enlightenment or the Romanticists? Certainly not. I believe the literature from 1300\u20131700 is called Renaissance literature only because of tradition, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough. And also, the new ways of thinking, the humanism and liberal arts, very much are connected to universities, which were inspired by the Greek schools of philosophy. And universities started in the middle ages\u2026 Swedish historian Dick Harrison states that the Renaissance was \u201ca last triumphant cultural heyday in the medieval society, which forms a bridge to the early modern age\u201d (Harrison Dick, Europa i v\u00e4rlden, Gothenburg 2000 - my translation). As a student and teacher of history, I find the term early modern age much more useful. Considering art, music and philosophy, the term Renaissance can be applied logically, as many people do. In literature - not so much. So did the Renaissance occur? Well, do you want it to? Then maybe it did. But it\u2019s like a piece of a puzzle that you must hammer to get it to fit. ",

            "answer_text": "As a Medieval Historian, I would disagree with you. Your reasons for thinking otherwise are indeed sound, but they overlook some important things. The word \u2018\u2019Renaissance\u2019\u2019 means \u2018\u2019Be-Birth.\u2019\u2019 In order for there to be a \u2018rebirth\u2019 there has to have been a \u2018death\u2019 of sorts. Indeed, in 1348 -1350 the most culturally shocking event happened to the peoples in Europe, and it began in Genoa and Venice. These were two important trading cities of the growing Italian city-states and had just begun to flush in their own right. Then, on an August afternoon in 1348, a number of rats made their way down the rope line from the merchant ships and into one of the worst moments in human history. The three forms of the Plague were Pneumonia, Septis, and Bubonic Plague wiped out 25-million people in a stunning turns of events. One in three people died, and the other two-thirds were forever affected by the loss of loved ones and the need for civil reform. Europeans across the continent were affected. Plague hit almost all of Italy and France, southern Spain and northern Africa. It was a devastating event in time. The timeline you brought up has a valuable merit to it. I can see why people think the way that they might concerning this time period. Consider the economic impact of having banks full of money of the dead? All of this money in the hands of a population that was 2/3rds the size it was before meant that the Middle classes were now impacted in a positive way. So it wasn\u2019t just the wealthy who benefitted. Moreover, certain painters began to view the world of religion in a different way. Giotto\u2019s painting of Jesus from the perspective of the feet first. The craftsmen who were painting had become full-fledged artists and they began to sign their own names to their work. It was the beginning of a humanistic movement where the individual was celebrated. You are correct in saying that there was a vague time-period. That was something that later generations assigned to it. The rebirth of Europe touched ALL the classes of people and it was a much more broad Renaissance than simply in the arts. The 12th century Renaissance was also a wide array and the lessons learned there were a catalyst for what would become the period of time known as the Renaissance. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, the 'Renaissance' occurred. During a particular period, notably between 1400 and 1600, there was a definite shift in culture, science and technology and these helped to advance and change Europe. The overarching theme of the 'Renaissance' was the use and interaction with Classical sources and ideals, and this triggered a 'rebirth' of European thought, art and ideas that influenced a range of spheres. One should also be careful to note, that this rebirth was not achieved in European (or Italian) isolation, and encompassed a number of countries and incorporated the influence of Islamic Empires, notably the Ottoman. It is not really relevant that some of its leading figures were born centuries apart, the interaction and use of ancient ideals that is the unifying theme. While in the early Renaissance this interaction tended to be one of emulation but by the end many of these 'icons' such as Vesalius and Machiavelli were either using their ideas to attack established perceptions or were attacking the primacy of the ancients. Moreover, I do not think that you can argue that the Renaissance had no impact on ordinary people. Many of the developments either changed society or trickled down to ordinary people - or the 'vulgar' as the would have been viewed historically - in some capacity. Inventions and discoveries during this period were of huge importance, such as the Discovery of the Americas using technologies new to Europe, had a profound (psychological) impact on Europe and how all people viewed the world and universe. The one area a 'Renaissance' can be questioned is in relation to the meddling of historians via periodization. The creation of a 'Renaissance' was a convenient label for Jules Michelet to describe a perceived flurry of activity in Italy. He thought that there was a break between the (dark) Middle Ages and the Modern period. A number of nineteenth century scholars - like Burckhardt - agreed with this view, and many liked to place (anachronistic) ideals of their own time on to the past. Yet more recent historiography has shown that rather than the 'Renaissance' representing a break or change from what was occurring before, it was a continuity of developments during the 'medieval' period - i.e. there was a great deal of continuity. This 'medieval' period also contained Petrarch, who is often credited with shaping or framing the beginning of the 'Renaissance'. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. First of all, in re the comment, we can tie the Renaissance to a series of events with consequences. It\u2019s a kind of reductive Marxism to say that it didn\u2019t occur because it originated from elites. Most of the major changes in history do. Also, as I note below, from Petrarch onwards, people did indeed recognize that something different was happening. As a student of medieval and Renaissance culture, literature, and history, I would challenge Mr. Bluestein on his interpretation of the term \u201cRenaissance\u201d, and his political interpretation. We can trace it, initially, to a letter of Petrarch from the 1330s in which he speaks of the light of classical antiquity and a (symbolic) \u201cDark Age\u201d intervening before a revival or rebirth of classical antiquity in the near future. Vasari used a comparable Italian term in the Lives Of The Painters (1550, rev. 1568), for the revival of painting in the 15th century. The modern use of the term, although popularized by Burckhardt\u2019s Civilization Of The Renaissance In Italy, was first used in English in the 1830s and by the French historian Jules Michelet in 1855. The \u201crebirth\u201d of the Renaissance is an intellectual and cultural, not a political or social, phenomenon, although the philosophy of the Renaissance has political and social implications. If we define the Renaissance as an intellectual movement, beginning in the mid-14th century in Florence, marked by a set of ideas inspired by classical antiquity and by a dramatic series of transformations in the visual arts and architecture, which transmits itself all over Europe by the beginning of the 16th century, and which we can say symbolically ends with the triumph of scientific rationalism with Newton\u2019s Principia of 1687, then it is very real indeed. The Florentines certainly thought so, as Cosimo di Medici founded the Platonic Academy and Ficino translated Plato into Latin in the 1460s. This in no way negates the enormous intellectual continuity between the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the great synthesis recognized and discussed by scholars like Panofsky and Yates. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u201cRenaissance\u201d as a label is a convenience for historians, just like \u201cBaroque\u201d music is. Historically, there was no such thing as \u201cBaroque\u201d music, it was never called that in the time period, and in fact the term \u201cBaroque\u201d is derogatory in its original meaning. That being said, \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d is a specific way of thinking and viewing the world that stood in direct contrast to what had existed before; it attempted to be secular, logical, and proof-driven, and revived a lot of very old Greek and Arabic thought, whereas the ideas that it was replacing tended to be rooted in religious and local superstition. (Note: Not all superstition and folk-myth is incorrect, nor did the Renaissance claim that it was; but to a Renaissance thinker, there had to be a REASON.) It is true that the revival of art and the new learning only directly effected the most well-off or well-connected people. However, those people were for the most part the ones who were setting the laws and procedures for all of the others, and effected how they were treated. So while it had a direct effect on only a few, it influenced the lives of many more. Additionally, as learning itself became more valued for its own sake, it became available to a wider variety of people. Far more people were literate in the 1600s than were in the 1300s. The Renaissance alone didn\u2019t cause that, of course - that is tied up also in the rise of the merchant middle-class - but the rise of the merchant middle-class was, in turn, helped along by the Renaissance thinkers, who put aside the notion that a man was born into his deserved social class and was destined to remain there for his whole life. The entire idea of upward social mobility was tied, to some extent, to Renaissance thinking. (The fact that more people were literate also helped along the so-called \u201cProtestant Revolution\u201d, another historical label that isn\u2019t tied to a specific time or place and involved thinkers who disagreed with each other or who existed a century or more apart. Martin Luther wasn\u2019t any more fond of Henry VIII than he was of the Catholic Pope. Part of the push against Catholicism was the fact that so many people had obtained translations of the Bible into their own, native languages\u2026 and decided that the Bible didn\u2019t say exactly what their Catholic priest had been telling them, all these years\u2026) So yes, you\u2019re correct that Renaissance thinking was rooted in a relatively small, wealthy class, and that it didn\u2019t move with one fell swoop over the entirety of Europe. It is a movement rather than being restricted to a single time-and-place the way we tend to like to teach history. That doesn\u2019t invalidate the label itself, though, just some of the ways that we try to use it. ",

Changes in history are not necessarily bounded to a massive event or revolution,they happen along the years and suddenly you find out. The revival of art affected anyone who went to a church and found it was not gothic any more,and lot of people went to church those years although remained poor. Even some of them had the chance to read printed books,even THE BIBLE in their native language thanks to some Luther who said something about personal interpretations that doesn\u2019t sound too medieval. Middle Ages exist though Charlemagne was born in the IX century and the war of the two roses took place several centuries later.

So green\u2019s argument for it not happening is that you couldn't really see it happening. Most peasants were not affected by it. As he put it you couldn't go like \u201c\"Mario! Luigi! Come look the renaissance is happening!\u201d Which is pretty obvious. It's not an event like WWII or the crusades, its more of an era of history. So it did occur, as an explosion of wealth and knowledge did occur in Europe in the time period in the years after the fall of Constantinople. ",

            "answer_text": "Another perspective: One way to look at the Renaissance is that it was somewhat the equivalent for Europe what the World Wars were for the United States. Up through the 19th century, the U.S. was always looking to imitate Europe, Britain in particular. Even as the U.S. became economically successful, it was still following on the coat-tails of Europe. Finally at the beginning of the 20th century the U.S. really began to develop its own identity and start to truly innovate in its own right, becoming more of a leader than a follower. The same can be said of Western Europe during the late Middle Ages. For much of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was a backwater. The Franks and the other realms of the region were at times militarily powerful, and gradually became economically significant. But they were still just following on the coat-tails of the Byzantines, the Arabs, the Ottomans, and more distantly the Persians, Chinese, and Hindus. Their knowledge of culture and technology came from the East; even their knowledge of ancient Roman and Greek culture came from there. The Renaissance was a gradual transition from simply being intellectual followers to being intellectual leaders. What is a myth is the notion that following Rome\u2019s decline the whole world was plunged into darkness and the mighty Europeans pulled the world out of ignorance in the early modern period. That sequence of events never occurred but Westerners like it because it justifies our arrogance. An interesting read: The Myth of the Renaissance in Europe ",

            "answer_text": "Western Europe definitely had a revival of learning and the growth of coherent states, a process afterwards labelled the Renaissance. Note that it was not worldwide.  Other civilisations had their own surges of creativity.  If part of the Renaissance was a revival of Greek knowledge, there was also a massive borrowing of ideas from the Islamic world.  Some of this had come from further afield: printing and paper from China and \"Arabic Numerals\" from Hindu culture. What also happened was the emergence of modern science, a network of people thinking about the world and freely communicating their ideas.  It faltered in Italy after the condemnation of Galileo, but continued elsewhere, notably in France, Britain, Holland and some parts of Germany. ",
