            "answer_text": "Even a small black bear is about twice the weight of a human, with a heavy skull and well protected vitals. But yes, a lucky human could kill a bear with bare hands by being fortunate enough to land on the bear just right after falling from a great height.  Seriously, one's only hope would be to break the larynx with a lucky blow and have the bear choke to death. Difficult to hit a small target on a well-protected neck. Killing the bear without landing a blow would be more elegant. Humans can run long distances, bears can't--but bears are MUCH faster over a short distance. A downhill run on a hot day would play to the human's advantages and against the bear's but it is that first 300 yards or so where the human has to stay ahead of the bear! Then keep it interested in a futile chase until it collapses of heat exhaustion. There is a story of a human killing a grizzly with nothing but a bowie knife but the man lost an arm in the fight. Another story I've seen is of a baseball pitcher killing a bear with rocks. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that this would be most unlikely , unless you picked on a baby bear or a smaller specimen of a smaller species like the spectacled bear found in India . Most bears are BIG - tipping the scales at well over 500 lbs in weight. for anyone working in British Imperial measure, a ten stone man weighs 140 lbs - so a twenty stone man is half the weight of a bigger bear. A bear like the American Grizzly, the Polar bear or Kodiak bear, even the European Brown Bear, can raise itself up on its hind legs and stand over six feet tall. The bear has massive teeth and claws as well, and a swipe from just its paws would hit you like a swing from a heavyweight boxer, probably hard enough to break your neck. It can fight on all fours, it can stand erect, its more than twice the weight of the biggest man you are ever likely to meet, and it can move with surprising speed and colossal strength.  And if that's not enough - its got teeth and claws as well. there have been men who have wrestled alligators, as well as someone who killed a leopard with his bare hands in a desperate fight for life.  but even if you had a weapon , I would not give much for anyone's chances against a bear.
