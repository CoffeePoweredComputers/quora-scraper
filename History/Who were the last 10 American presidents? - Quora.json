            "answer_text": "JFK \u2014 Second youngest president (after TR); first of the WW2 \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d to become president (the last was Bush 41); known for having a pretty wife, and yet he cheated. But at least he saved the world during Cuban Missile Crisis. Lyndon Johnson (LBJ) \u2014 Skilled Texan pol who, by signing landmark Civil Rights legislation, gave the white South to the Republicans; he\u2019d be a great president for that, except his reputation was destroyed by staying in the Vietnam War, an unpopular war that couldn\u2019t be won. Nixon \u2014 Could\u2019ve been a near-great president, thanks to his opening communication with Russia and China, but he was done in by Vietnam War and Watergate, a \u201cthird rate burglary\u201d of Democratic Headquarters that he tried to cover up. Only president ever forced to resign. Ford \u2014 Nixon\u2019s well-meaning replacement. Not a bad man, but was parodied by Chevy Chase on the new show, SNL. Carter \u2014 Peanut farmer from Georgia; \u201cborn again\u201d but moderately liberal. Like Ford, he had bad luck on the economy\u2026 he also lost points because of the Iran Hostage crisis, even if it wasn\u2019t his fault. Had one great success: peace between Israel and Egypt. Reagan \u2014 Cowboy president and \u201cGreat Communicator.\u201d Former movie actor. Tried \u201csupply side\u201d economics but later had to raise taxes. Stood up to \u201cEvil Empire\u201d (Russia) but later decided to talk to Gorbachev. At least he showed the virtue of being able to change his mind. Bush \u201c41\u201d \u2014 Won the First Iraq War but paid less attention to the economy. Lost his re-election by poor debate performance in which he looked at his watch and didn\u2019t know what the price of milk was. Bill Clinton \u2014 \u201cSlick Willy\u201d to some; \u201cBubba\u201d to others, despite his being a Rhodes Scholar. Eight years of peace and prosperity, and first budget surplus in generations, all marred by a scandal with an intern. He felt your pain. Bush \u201c43\u201d \u2014 \u201cW.\u201d went back into Iraq, but unlike his Daddy, he went all the way to Baghdad and tried to occupy it. Badly blew the Clinton budget surplus. Barack Obama \u2014 Started with a disastrous economy handed to him by \u201cW.\u201d and then turned it around. Finally got bin Laden. ObamaCare, still controversial. Obama was a constitutional law prof and country\u2019s first non-white president. And then there\u2019s Trump\u2026 probably will never down calling all of Africa \u201csh*thole countries.\u201d ",
