            "answer_text": "As I sit here, I am literally facing an entire wall of books on Philippine history, the product of half a century of accumulation on the topic. (Another wall and a half of books related to Philippine history are beside and behind me.) Even if I eliminated 90% of them as too specialized or unworthy of consideration that\u2019s still far too many books to list here. So let me make a few general comments on some of the leading historians in the field. Agoncillo, History of the Filipino People, is a standard textbook, written (with various co-authors) by a man long considered the dean of Filipino historians. He had his particular strengths - particularly nationalism in the period of the Revolution - but on other topics he tends to be weaker, presumably because he was less interested in them. His thinking - and his disciples - tend(ed) to dominate the History Department of the University of the Philippines for many years. Renato Constantino, The Philippines: A Past Revisited, is similar to Agoncillo, in that it\u2019s strong on topics that interested him, weak elsewhere. Many find it too ideological (vaguely leftist). A successor volume covers the period from WWII onward. Horacio de la Costa, SJ, was perhaps the best Filipino historian ever, but his commitments as a Jesuit meant he did not write as much history as we might like. His edited Readings in Philippine History is still one of the best-balanced collections of source materials we have. Reynaldo Ileto is probably the most influential living Filipino historian, but has never written a general history of the Philippines. His Pasyon and Revolution was a tremendous breakthrough for conceptualizing Filipino mentalities below the level of the articulate elite (such as Jose Rizal), but all of his essays are worth pondering, and he has a new book on the Philippine-American War just out this year. Similar in scope is Vicente Rafael, who brings a wealth of modern theory to the topic of Filipino identity and perceptions over time in a considerable number of essays and monographs; I would consider him \u201cstate of the art\u201d in sophisticated understanding of the Philippine past. Ambeth Ocampo is a wonderful popularizer of Filipiniana, who has never (to my knowledge) written a sustained analysis of any particular topic within Philippine history, but has produced hundreds - literally - of short articles illuminating little corners of the subject, particularly the personal lives of Filipino \u201cheroes.\u201d If you\u2019re just getting interested in the field, you may find him an easy access to fascinating tidbits. O.D. Corpuz, onetime Minister of Education, wrote a massive (2-vols.) book on The Roots of the Filipino Nation that only covers the period up to 1906. It\u2019s well-researched and generally very reliable, though not an easy read. He also has written a one-volume economic history of the Philippines. Distinguished non-Filipinos writing about Philippine history include W.H. Scott (particularly on the early Philippines and on Mountain Province), John Schumacher, SJ (particularly on nationalism and on the Roman Catholic Church), Alfred McCoy, Michael Cullinane, John Larkin, Jim Richardson, and Daniel Doeppers. Many of them focus more on social and economic history than on the political and intellectual history of nationalism that tends to be dominant among Filipino historians. None of these men has written (AFAIK) a general history of the Philippines, but David Joel Steinberg, The Philippines: A Singular and a Plural Place is an excellent short introduction to the topic; if you\u2019re looking for just one book on Philippine history, I might recommend that. (Disclaimer: Steinberg was my advisor and remains my friend.) No doubt as soon as I hit the \u201csubmit\u201d button I\u2019ll think of others I should have mentioned, but this should be enough to give you a decent start on the subject. ",
