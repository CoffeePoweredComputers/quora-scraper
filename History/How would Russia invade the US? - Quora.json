            "answer_text": "It's just not possible. Even if Russia and China were to Allie with each other to launch such an attack, they wouldn't stand much of a chance. They don't have the capsbility naval wise to support such an assault. Their Navies just don't stand up to the might of even just the Pacific Fleet, let alone the US Navy as a whole. Much of the PacFlt would have to be neutralized in some fashion as would the US Pacific allies.Any attacker would have to have some way of countering the US nuclear forces. Russia would need some form of its own \u201cStar Wars\u201d program to neutralize any US nuclear attack. Currently, they are far from having thst ability as is the US.Where does one actually invade? It's always been hupothosised thst the Pacific NorthWest could be a target. But you cant launch any major invasion across the Bering Strait. The weather and terrain wouldn't allow it.Now, John Vilnius, who directed \u201cRed Dawn 1984\u201d came up with a realistic scenario for thst time. Thst was based on the idea the NATO would dissolve, the US would become isolationist, and the USSR, with its allies in Cuba and Nicaragua, would launch an invasion through Mexico and into the US Midwest. But that's even more impossible today because Russia doesn't have much of a relationship with either nation these days and both countries have drastically cut their military force levels. During the 70s and 80s, Cuba alone had a military of over 200,000, but today, it's less then 50,000 approx. It's just not possible today. ",

            "answer_text": "You are getting ahead of yourself, here, because this is the sixth step in a threat scenario, and you need to postulate a number of other steps first. First, why would Russia want to invade the United States? What would they have to gain from this? Territory, wealth, power, and an end to any American threat to Russia? Okay, then. First, the Russia government has to defeat NATO in a war. Even if the Americans withdraw from NATO, Russia probably still have to do this as Russia has no land boundary with the United States, has no air boundary other than the one with Alaska, and only three ports from which to send ships out to fight American ships: Murmansk, Archanglesk. and Vladivostock. If Russia doesn\u2019t conquer at least part of Europe, they cannot even get close enough to the American army and air force to fight a proper war. Then, they have to defeat the Americans on the battlefield, somewhere, or they will not have weakened the United States enough to invade it. Second, the Russians have to convince the United States to get rid of or disarm all of its nuclear weapons. How this is to be managed, I leave you to determine. An invasion force has to land somewhere, and, when it lands, a single tactical nuclear weapon can eliminate it. Third, the Russians have to defeat the American air forces. The Americans have two of them, one land based, one naval. They outnumber the Russian air force something like four to one, they have better planes, and the United States has the resources to replace aircraft and pilots probably four times as fast as Russia. Fourth, the Russians would have to defeat the American navy. It is something like ten times as powerful and numerous as the Russian navy and far more technologically advanced. As invasion forces have to be carried across the ocean in transports and container ships, it would have to be almost wiped out before an invasion could be considered. Fifth, the Russians would have to find the resources to build an army big enough to defeat an American army, the ships to transport that army across an ocean, and several times that number of ships to carry reinforcements and supplies across the ocean. The American National Guard and Reserves can be easily brought up to an equipped strength of a million men and women to fight in North America. Russia may or many not currently have the means to transport and supply an invasion force of perhaps ten thousand men. Where it would get the rest of the resources needed for an invasion I leave to you to ponder. Once you have accomplished all of the above, then you can pick your invasion spot. Strictly speaking, if you have accomplished all that I listed. You don\u2019t need to invade the United States. You\u2019ve already won the war. Just ask for a surrender and bomb them regularly until they give up. ",
