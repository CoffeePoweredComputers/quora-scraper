China is the hometown of porcelain (\u74f7\u5668 [c\u00ed q\u00ec]), and Chinese porcelain is highly commended for its extremely high practicality and artistry all over the world. Chinese porcelain, as one of the earliest works of art introduced into the western countries by the silk road (\u4e1d\u7ef8\u4e4b\u8def [s\u012b ch\u00f3u zh\u012b l\u00f9]), is known for its delicate texture, beautiful color, and exquisite sculpture. In the course of its development, Chinese porcelain was made in the form of many kinds of items such as cups, tea sets, bowls, incense burners, vases, etc., which rapidly became a necessity of daily life in the middle and upper classes.Porcelain is made from chinastone, kaolin, quartz, and many other materials, with the glassy glaze or painting on the appearance. The porcelain is made by firing at high temperature (1280\u20131400 \u2103) in the kiln. And the glaze color on the porcelain surface will vary with the temperature, which gives rise to the diversity of Chinese porcelain. Porcelain is the treasure of Chinese civilization. History of Chinese Porcelain The predecessor of Chinese porcelain was the primitive celadon (\u9752\u74f7 [q\u012bng c\u00ed]) , which was the product of the transition from pottery to porcelain. The earliest primitive celadon in China was found at the Dongxiafeng cultural relic in Xia county, Shanxi province. The primitive celadon was made in Xia dynasy (2070 BC\u20131600 BC) about 4,200 years ago. The primitive celadon was widely distributed in China and was found in the yellow river, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the south area of China. With the development of Chinese porcelain, more and more kinds of porcelain became to emerge. By the Eastern Han dynasty period (206 BC\u2013220 AD), the primitive celadon had developed into porcelain. After the emergence of primitive celadon from the Shang dynasty (1600 BC\u20131046 BC) to the Eastern Han dynasty, Chinese porcelain had experienced 1600\u20131700 years of changes and development and entered a new era. During the Tang dynasty (618\u2013906 CE), the development of porcelain was becoming more and more prosperous.

The decorative techniques such as engraving, scratching, printing, decals, carving and hollowing appeared. The white porcelain from Xing kiln in Hebei Province was known for its white color and hardness, which was very popular in the west. The Yue kiln of Zhejiang Province was also well known for its beautiful celadon.In the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), new improvements was made in the aspects of quality, glaze and manufacturing skills.

(Ru kiln was the most famous one of the five kilns in the Song dynasty. It added treasured agate into glaze, making the color and texture unique compared to the jade. Ding kiln was famous for its white porcelain with the delicate texture and little pink in white glaze. Porcelain of Jun kiln was made for the royal family that each porcelain had its own unique decorative patterns and colors.In the Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368), the blue and white porcelain (\u9752\u82b1\u74f7 [q\u012bng hu\u0101 c\u00ed]) became the mainstream. Jingdezhen (\u666f\u5fb7\u9547 [j\u01d0ng d\u00e9 zh\u00e8n]) in Jiangxi province added cobalt on the process of making porcelain and invented the blue and white porcelain, which became an imperial porcelain production center in that period.
