            "answer_text": "One of the things that is terribly lacking form most history books, is a good feeling for what was going on around the world at the same time. History is taught as being linear, it has a beginning and an end, which is not a problem in itself, but then we break it down into different cultures. So we speak of Egyptian history, or Sumerian history, or Persian history, or Greek history, but we follow each one separately from their founding to their demise. Then we move on to the next one. At best, we follow the rise of Western Civilization, in capital letters, as one thread, and if we follow a thread of Eastern civilization at all (speaking of history as it was taught in the US, at least), it is most likely ancient to modern China, India, and Japan, each also taught sequentially geographically from founding to the modern day. We\u2019re never taught about things like \u201cWhat was happening in the whole world between 1250 and 1350?\u201d, or we would know that the Cahokia mound civilization in the Americas was dying down about the time St Francis founded his holy order, China was sending out the Treasure Fleet, Mongols rule China, Ghengis Khan had invaded the Punjab in 1221, and the Viking settlers of Greenland were leaving due to the beginning of the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d. (I know that those events are scattershot through the era, but that\u2019s kind of my whole point; it\u2019s really hard to find any sources that give you a broad overview of history even by century.) When you do find history that weaves narratives of the sorts of things that were effecting all people over the world, like the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d between circa 1300\u20131600, it helps to put historical events into perspective. It\u2019s good to know what was going on in the Americas between 1000 and 1500, in relation to what was happening in Europe, and Asia, and Africa. Greater Zimbabwe fell into that 500 year range. Civilizations around the world rose and fell during this time, it would be nice to have a better grasp on how each falls into place in an integrated tale of human development, not as isolated examples of brief candle flames being lit and going back out. We also tell each empire\u2019s tale as though it were unbroken history, when it often isn\u2019t that simple. We speak of China as though it has been the same country for 5000 years, when it is more true to say that it has been many countries with a shared culture over that time, the same for Roman and Egyptian empires. Even the United States has a problem with this: we date our country\u2019s founding to 1776, but that was the States united under the Articles of Confederation, which were too weak, so we formed \u201ca more perfect union\u201d when a majority of those states ratified the current Constitution\u2026 in 1789, on the fourth of March. Some would argue the current strong federal government didn\u2019t even exist until after Reconstruction was over in 1875. Historians need to do a much better job of including each world culture, in a broad and integrated explanation of the unfolding of history, showing how nothing happens in a vacuum, and many concurrent events were inter-related. Teaching only dates, places, and wars is not teaching history, in my opinion. History is about how people lived their lives, who traded with whom, and if history was taught as I propose here, we wouldn\u2019t have to memorize dates and names, as we would have a better grasp on the world-wide sequence of events, and knowing what happened in which order is more important than remembering the dates those things happened on. I\u2019m not saying dates aren\u2019t important, but it\u2019s much more important to know things like whether two world leaders were contemporaries or not. Without looking it up, do you know whether Chairman Mao was a contemporary of Stalin, or if they met? Do you know if Winston Churchill knew Queen Victoria? I\u2019d be willing to bet those that can answer one of those can\u2019t answer the other. And that\u2019s fairly recent history. We forget that Shakespeare would have known about the English colonists in Virginia. Marco Polo knew enough about \u201cCathay\u201d to travel all the way from Italy to China in the thirteenth century, when we generally have a notion that people did not travel. The Apostle Paul nearly walked around the entire Mediterranean in the first century. Roman roads were being repaired at least as late as the 1800\u2019s. (Sometimes not well, but they were maintained.) Much of the more interesting facts of history are ignored, or poorly presented, to focus on the same tired old method of teaching by rote memory of dates, names, and places where battles happened. We should not leave the interesting bits of history to be taught us by crackpot theorists with an agenda, simply because no one else will cover the subjects. ",
