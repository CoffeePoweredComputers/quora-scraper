            "answer_text": "An interesting question. But not because of the items mentioned below. \u201cOften\u201d is a relative term. Since the sword came into use in the Bronze Age and was used in combat into World War II one can easily say it was used \u201cquite often\u201d - not just for many centuries, but for a few millennia. \u201cOften\u201d can also relate to its use within a given historical period. For example, as opposed to current pop-culture views, the descendant of the Viking Sword were main weapons until the 13th century, transitioned to a side weapons from the 1400s and into the Rennaissance and then came back into prominence as a cavalry weapon afterward, such as their use in the Americal Civil War. Even then, groups like the Lansknechte \u201coften\u201d used Doppelsoldner Zweihanders as their weapon of choice. \u201cOften\u201d can also relate to its use in relation to other weapons, such as a percentage of use within a given military force. And this is where things get dicey. It is very true that - in general, broad-stroke terms - the spear and its kin often made up a significant percentage of any given force. But that is because a spear is cheaper to construct and easier to train \u2026 to get to a base level of effectiveness. This made it one of the most used weapons of choice for filling out the rank and file. Thus one could say the sword was not used \u201cas often\u201d as a spear. Along the same lines, however, if you were worth the additional training, the sword was \u201cmore often\u201d the weapon of choice. Does this mean, simply by numbers, the spear was the better main weapon? No. That took more development to move beyond a static defense that was vulnerable to being flanked or becoming disorganized the moment they tried to move or a break was made in their ranks. Again we end up in the 1400s, when the Swiss added discipline, formation marching, and more training to create the traditional pike square. One should also remember that for most of its life the sword was not used by itself. Its tactical partner was the shield and they worked in tandem for centuries. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally speaking swords weren't used nearly as much as pop culture would like you to believe. For infantry there were really only two situations where swords were preferred. When your polearm broke and when for some odd reason the enemy got really close and your mates didn't stab and hack him into bits. Or if you were an archer, you are out of arrows and you would like to flank the enemy but you have no use to your bow anymore because as it has been said before you are out of arrows. For cavalry after a successful charge the lances may be dropped and then swords come in extra handy. So as you see depending on your role on the battlefield you used the sword accordingly. Probably cavalry got the most use out of it while the people on foot saw little to no use in most battles. As for the lifespan. Well it depends a lot on material quality. There were no quality standards back then, the Persians and Arabs wrote multiple times that the hindy swords (wootz/real Damascus) frequently broke in cold weather (the hardened ones that is). Given the context it means room temperature for us Europeans. Japanese swords had the quality problems of the laminate and differentially hardened construction, it has a tendency to bend, the edge is hard enough that it will chip frequently etc. European swords were relatively softer than Japanese swords (not softer than wootz though) which meant they don't hold an edge as well but they don't chip that often either. So all in all due to the varying levels of technology and lack of any standardization in quality control a lifespan of a sword that was in frequent use ranged from the first hit to generations. ",

            "answer_text": "Swords were usually one of the least used weapons in combat. One reason why is because in most cultures it was a side-arm, used after the main weapon was unusable. An exception to this was middle and late Roman legionaries, where it was the main weapon. Another reason why is because it was expensive to make. It took more metal to make a sword than multiple spear heads, arrowheads, or axe-heads. This made it a symbol of prestige and nobility in many cultures. A sword also had a rather difficult time piercing mail and plate armor. Halberds, warhammers, maces, and lances were much more effective at disabling or killing armored opponents than with a sword As for the lifetime of a combat sword, it depended on the type of metal used, what conditions the sword has been exposed to, and the quality of the workmanship. There are very few ancient bronze swords as many have decomposed and tarnished over the centuries til they are no longer effective. However, the legendary Goujian sword of China has been around for 2000 years without a trace of tarnishing or decomposition and still has its sharp edge. While some swords could be used for a couple of battles before losing its edge or suffering from a crack or other foundational issue, many swords were passed down as family heirlooms and used for centuries.

            "answer_text": "Sword is a name covering a LOT of different weapons. For example, the Chinese prefer a single edge, heavy and slightly curved thick blade, which offer good armor penetration against chain/scale mail and does a lot of damage. Europeans seem to prefer a long, straight, double edge blade with good stabbing ability to take out joints. Arabic light cavalry and Japanese samurai tends to favor a light, curved blade which works well against lightly armor opponent. It heavily dependent on what kind of opponent you are fighting. Also, spear and its variant is more dominant for large armies because: 1.) It is cheaper 2.) Its range helps your soldier to survive. Most well organized army will have a mixture of spearmen and sword/board soldiers. ",
