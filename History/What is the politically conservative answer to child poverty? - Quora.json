            "answer_text": "When the war on poverty began 7% of children were born outside of marriage. Today that number is 41%. The collapse of marriage is the main cause of child poverty today. Welfare creates a need for even greater assistance in the future. It discourages work, penalizes marriage, and undermines self-sufficiency During LBJ\u2019s Presidency, they went knocking door to door, telling black women that if there was no male in the home that they could draw money from the State. Black families went from 17% having no father in the 1960\u2019s to 74% having no Father today. This has everything to do with the problem in upward mobility. The welfare state has increased, while their success has decreased. The current system punishes those who try to escape poverty, effectively adding a huge marginal tax burden in the form of diminishing benefits. Recent work by scholars, notably the progressive historian Herbert Gutman, show that despite the enormous strains that slavery placed on the black family, blacks worked hard to reunite and rebuilt their families after slavery, and they did so not on a matriarchal model but rather on that of the traditional \u201cnuclear\u201d family, which was the prevailing norm for African Americans through the first 2/3 of the 20th century. This is probably the single factor most responsible for retarding the development of young people. As anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski put in \u201cSex, Culture and Myth,\u201d it is a \u201cuniversal sociological law\u201d that \u201cno child should be brought into the world without a man\u2014and one man at that\u2014assuming the role of sociological father, that is, guardian and protector, the male link between the child and the rest of the community. Malinowski\u2019s statement was not controversial at the time. Many other anthropologists, including Margaret Mead, made the same point. Today, however, anyone who says that children should not be raised without fathers is routinely attacked by progressive and left-wing activists. They have no problem with high illegitimacy rates for blacks and other minorities and resist those who treat this problem as a problem. The dramatic increase in black illegitimacy from 17\u201374% occured during and after LBJ\u2019s Great Society. We cannot blame it on slavery. We must attribute it to things that happened during this period, notably the culture that produced widespread illegitimacy and a federal government willing and ready to subsidize (and thus encourage) it. In other words, we can\u2019t fault the Democrats of the Jacksonian era; we must fault the Democrats from LBJ\u2019s time to our own. These Democrats have been not merely the enablers but also the cheerleaders of family breakdown. I\u2019m for a Universal Basic Income\u2014Or a \u201cnegative income tax\u201d Imagine replacing the vast agencies that oversee programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, EBT, housing subsidies, and a host of other interventions with one department given a simple and clear mandate. It\u2019s ideal. You\u2019d be slashing government bureaucracy. We would return to a market economy. Giving a large segment of the population the power to vote with their dollars is far superior to the government deciding how much they may spend on rent, food, education, and other necessities. It would completely break the welfare cycle. Paradoxically, a universal basic income makes it pay to work. Guaranteed income is the surest route to restoring old-fashioned, middle-class morality. For conservatives who care about culture, a bipartisan push to dismantle the welfare state could be the catalyst for a type of social renewal that we dream about. This puts work, family, & community \u2014 not government \u2014 back at the center of civic life. Plus, able bodied people wouldn\u2019t be discouraged from working, because they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about losing their benefits. They\u2019d get to keep every additional dollar, & at the same time forced to assume responsibilities. More Boys would grow up with a Father, which makes better Men. As in \u201cGood\u201d men. Motives for these types of policy innovations are described in purely economic terms. A lot of Conservatives would be swayed by the promise of a world with fewer bureaucrats. ",

            "answer_text": "Child Poverty? First you have to define child poverty. What I will suggest is poverty in and of itself is not a problem. What is a problem is instead perhaps malnutrition, unsafe housing, lack of medical care - those things are a problem. How much money your parents make or don\u2019t make is not a problem for a child. Remote tribes around the world have zero cash and that is not a problem. So my first answer is - the question of poverty is entirely too broad. It\u2019s not my business how much money a parent might make in my city. It should be my business if children are living under freeway overpasses. Or if a child is not getting proper vaccinations or treated for an infection because of no money. I am going to rant for a minute here - I am a little fatigued with this pervasive idea from society in general but the \u201cOh so concerned wokesters\u201d in particular that poor people are some kind of problem to be solved. This hand-wringing about \u201cWhat are we going to do about the poor!\u201d Poor people are not \u201ca problem\u201d that needs solving. These are not \u201cproblem people\u201d they are just people with very little money and other resources. So - stop calling poor people \u201ca problem\u201d and start focusing on what is really a problem, namely lack of sanitation, etc. In general we have done a lot for poverty in society. Our poor are not any thinner than our middle class. There have been pretty good strides in housing homeless in recent years. There is free health care available. Some of this does not work as well as we might wish or need but we have some things in place. I am for affirmative action in school choice but not based on race but instead based on family income. If a child comes from a poor environment, under educated parents, perhaps parents that dont\u2019 have skills the best thing for that child is to go to school where there are a mix of parents and most of them are fully functional. That exposes a child and hopefully will motivate that child. Another thing about poor parents is many of them will overcome poverty. They will get the skills, get the jobs and move up in the world. Many poor parents are fairly young people, in their 20\u2019s and early 30\u2019s and just need a bit more time to figure out life and rise out of poverty. Some will not and the fact is a certain percentage of these parents are probably not capable. They have serious learning issues, or maybe they have serious emotional issues, some psychiatric and being gainfully employed in a position that requires complex skills - probably not going to happen. These kinds of families are going to be on social services. The best thing you can do for those children is to have educational opportunities and community mentorship opportunities and hopefully they will grow up to find and take advantage of better opportunities and they will become adults who are not in poverty.
