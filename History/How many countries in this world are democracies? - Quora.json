            "answer_text": "Democracy in true for, only Switzerland. The other countries claiming they have democracy have a so called representative democracy. In theory it means you that you have elections once in 4,5,6 years or so where the people vote for candidates to become president or prime minister. People ususally chose the candidate that promise to enforce some Changes that appeals to them. Once in Power the elected politicians should keep their promise and follow through the policies that got them elected. that is the theory, Theory tells us that representative democracies should be more effective since we elect someone that repressent our interests in the parliament so we don\u2019t need to bother and could focus on other things. In practice repressentative democracy means that you elect politicians on false promises that they don\u2019t intend on following through and they don\u2019t take responsibility for until the next election. It also means in practice that people vote for one thing and get something completely different, consistentely I might add. Rumours say that Mark Twain said \u201cIf voting made a difference they wouldn\u2019t let us. . . it would be illegal\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There is only one that comes close to true democracy and that is Switzerland. In that country they have a direct democracy that all the people vote and have the opportunity to make laws and change the constitution. All the rest are just mere representative that does not reflect a true democracy. a small percentage actually make laws and vote supposedly on our behalf but bear in mind they do not have to follow the path you think is right. They make decisions on their own influenced by any number of things including large sums of money from lobbyists. I would also like to state that capitalism is also not democratic. So here in the US we have the double wammy . Right now in all the world there are only a few companies that exhibit a democratic capitalism. There are no states that are democratic capitalist.  what do I mean by that? In some companies the workers are part of the process and part owners of the company and are given a voice in the decisions of the company. This is called a worker owned coop. This is the only true democratic capitalism in the world that is a fact that most companies would not want you to know about for their position and their great wealth would be compromised. If this compels you in any way to learn more look up a author by the name of Richard Wolff Professor Richard D. Wolff  ",
