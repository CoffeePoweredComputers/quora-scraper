            "answer_text": "Endless differences! One might as well ask: what are the differences between your dog and a Bengal tiger? Nonetheless, the question is interesting if its meant to inquire what the BIGGEST difference is\u2026 Probably the single biggest difference is one\u2019s relationship to authority, especially in the Western world. In the Medieval world, the opinion of an \u201cexpert,\u201d especially in but not limited to religion, instantly solved everything. And I mean that literally. Quoting the right authority figure \u2014 whether it was the Bible, a Church-approved scientist, or Aristotle \u2014 tend to end discussions quickly. If you wanted to know how the world was created, you quoted how the Church interpreted Genesis, and that was that. If you wanted to settle almost any other question in physics, you looked at what Aristotle had to say, and that was that. If you wanted to settle any moral question at all, you simply asked the Church, and that was that. Today we live in a world in which \u2014 unless you are a member of a cult \u2014 even average people take it for granted that logic and evidence can be used to refute the \u201cexperts\u201d in any field, even theology and morality. This, by the way, is why people like the \u201cNew Atheists\u201d (Hitchens, Dawkins, etc) can actually advance their views. 500 years ago, they would\u2019ve been burned at the stake by the end of the day. The religionists didn\u2019t just fold, of course, but now they accept that Christian apologists have to argue point-by-point with these people, using logical arguments, rather than by calling up the local Inquisition to round up the New Atheists and have them tortured to death. Which is exactly what would\u2019ve happened just a few centuries ago. As a point of reference: the Greeks in the Golden Age of Athens were unique in ancient history for asking the basic questions, centered on \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d And that attitude enabled them to invent logic, philosophy, drama, Euclidean geometry, the jury system, and democracy, among other things\u2026 But nowadays we are all (again, assuming you\u2019re not in a cult) expected to ask the basic questions that the Greeks did.

            "answer_text": "You mean, besides the technology? After all, the Middle Ages did not have the Internet! Several things, really. I will give a brief overview, as a thorough discussion would be a 1,500 page book. One, the structure of society. In the Middle Ages it was fully feudal; the common people obeyed the orders of their local lord, or perhaps the rulers of the city they were living in. Today, while the common people still obey orders, the way of choosing their leaders has changed; in many places elections choose leaders. Two, knowledge. In the Middle Ages, people did not know about the rest of the world. Someone in Europe did not know about the Western Hemisphere, for example, nor did someone in the Aztec Empire know about China or Japan. Knowledge of how diseases spread was miniscule compared to what we know today. These are just two very minor examples of how much knowlege has grown. Three, how people made their living. Most people in Middle Age Europe were farmers, or connected to farmers, such as millers and brewers. Today, the proportion of farmers is miniscule, as well as absolute numbers. Four, travel. Today, someone in Europe can travel to China or Australia or North America with just one or two jet flights (depending on connections) that take you you to the other side of the world in less than a day. Compare that to Marco Polo, who took, if I remember correctly, 17 YEARS to go from Venice to Beijing and back. Five, religion. In Middle Age Europe almost EVERYONE was Roman Catholic; it was so universal that it was not even discussed. You could be Jewish, of course, but in the Middle Ages Jews were generally in ghettos. Moslems were known as Saracens, and NOT welcomed in Europe. Protestants were unknown. Compare that to today. Just my $0.02. ",
