            "answer_text": "What is the State Motto of South Carolina? \u201cAmerica: Love it or Leave it; We live by these words as We did it T-W-I-C-E\u201d!!! During the \u2018War of Canadian Liberation\u2019 (1812) which America fought to give every Canadian their God given right to own slaves, the Southern States supplied troops to defend our capital and repel the British Invaders while New England supplied Mother England with all the boots, rope, food and supplies she could desire. After said war, the Southern States were rewarded for their PATRIOTISM & Service to the Country with such soul crushing Tariffs that the Agriculture based South wouldn\u2019t be able to trade with Europe and thus would go under. So what did plucky little South Carolina do? She declared the Tariffs of 1828 & 1832 unenforceable, issued the Ordinance of Nullification in its stead and started mobilizing her state militias to repel the projected Yankee scum/federal Invaders. What was President Jackson\u2019s response? \u201cIf I have to come down there with Federal troops, I will hang every White Man, age 10 & up, from that damn tree of theirs\u201d\u2026(paraphrased). American Vice President John C. Calhoun was instrumental in: (a) Calming Old Hickory down (See the statue of America\u2019s Greatest Gun Slinger that Trump defended from those \u2018Soccer Hooligans\u201d Jacksons dueling record of 8-0 including planting the best gun slinger East of the Mississippi still stands today) and (b) Compelling South Carolina to stand down her Militias\u2014-Which VP Pence didn\u2019t do for you, GOV Witmer!!! A compromise was reached and everybody was happy until\u2026 South Carolina packed up the kiddies and left us again in 1860. If President Jackson were president in 1860, there wouldn\u2019t have been a civil war, I\u2019m just sayin\u2019\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "John C. Calhoun served as Vice-president for 2 different Presidents John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson and clashed with both. Calhoun resigned his postion at the end of Jackson's first term. He is best known as his role in the Senate as a staunch advocate for slavery and Southern political influence. He was one of the three titans of the early 19th century United States Senate. The other two were Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. Those three were the impetus behind the Compromise of 1920 or Missouri Compromise. The principles behind the Compromise were that there would be an equal number of Slave and Free States. Missouri, a slave state was admitted along with Maine, a free state as the newest states in 1820. Except for Missouri, slavery was prohibited North of thr 36\u2032 30\" parallel. John Calhoun was the prototype for the rich plantation owner and White Supremacist Democrat. He laid the groundwork for succession before the Civil War during the Nullification Crisis of 1832. nullification crisis | Summary & Significance Calhoun was effective in politics but I think History will count him among those on the wrong side.
