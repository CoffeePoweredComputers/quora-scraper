Now he won\u2019t even tell us what he plans to do with the SCOTUS. Raise taxes, bow to China, open borders and citizenship for Illegals. Ban fossil fuels. 10$ of Trillion$ for Green New Deal. You ever actually looked at the power that gives the Federal Government over cities and states? And of course he wants stack the Court. They get enough Activist Judges on it and you can kiss your Constitutional Rights goodbye. ",

Biden\u2019s lead is huge, with only a couple weeks to Election Day, and it seems like no move Donald makes can convince anyone that Biden is the horror that Trump wants to portray him as, at least outside of the diehard Trumpers who decided before Biden ever even took the stage. This pandemic has blasted a massive and irreparable hole in Trump\u2019s public image and reputation, and it\u2019s a hole he created for himself and does not possess the humility or empathy to seal.
