            "answer_text": "I second the Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America. I would keep in mind that it is an outsider's perspective though. He's got a slightly skewed idea of things but it is very interesting regardless. The other works I'd check out are some of the books on various types of work that really built this nation, such as railroading and building the transcontinental railroads, and other materials along those lines. The analysis of psychologies, but the actions of the workers and Americans at the time speak much louder than these \"analysis.\" Another amazing thing that happened is to read about Henry Flagler who built the railroad down the east coast of Florida all the way to the Keys. There was a distinct love involved for his wife that kicked it off. In addition he started hospitals, basically founded Miami and prevented it from dying of disease and such, and prevented St. Augustine from becoming a dying city. Now it is one of the more beautiful places in Florida. Those are just a small snippets, there are literally 100s of good books to read about this period though. My first piece of advice I'd give though, before jumping into these books - FORGET what you learned in public schools, MOST of it is wrong.  Reading these books will begin to give you a real and full context of American History. ",

            "answer_text": "For non-fiction: Metropolitan Corridor by John Stilgoe is a great history book about the vernacular landscape of America generally and the transformation of small towns across the country by the advent of the railroad in the 19th century particularly. His Common Landscape of America is wonderful, but covers the development of the built environment from the 16th to the 19th centuries.For fiction:  Moby Dick by Herman Melville (fascinating account of American mercantile shipping and whaling industries, also perhaps best American novel, period)Litttle Women by Louisa May Alcott (New England family of girls in Civil War-era United States)The books of Edith Wharton (Age of Innocence, Custom of the Country, House of Mirth) and Henry James (Washington Square) (customs and mores in 19th century New York)",
