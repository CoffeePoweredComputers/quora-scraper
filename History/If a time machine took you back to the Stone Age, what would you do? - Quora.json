            "answer_text": "Make friends with a band of hunter-gatherers. Weedle my way into the band, because alone i will surely die. Stone age (Paleolithic) communities were based on cooperation both within the band and with bands they came in contact with. Stone age people knew that their best strategy for survival was not to compete with other bands (war) but to cooperate. Also, the earth was so sparsely populated at that time (it\u2019s estimated that 25,000 years ago there were no more than 150,000 people in ALL of Africa) that competition, either within or across groups, with its probability of injury or death, wasn\u2019t an option. So, back to your question. I would join the first band that would have me. I would be as kind and helpful as possible to guarantee that i would always have a place in the band. ",
