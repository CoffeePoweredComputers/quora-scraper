            "answer_text": "There has been great music and terrible music in virtually every time period. But I\u2019d say that the golden age of popular music was the period running from 1966 to 1975. During that time, music was the most important cultural expression. Music expressed and even influenced what was going on in society. When the period began the Beatles were still together. The period was the greatest era of the singer-songwriter. 1966 included The Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d The Beatles\u2019 \u201cRevolver,\u201d Simon and Garfunkel, the Mamas and The Papas and the Rolling Stones. 1967 saw the release of \u201cSgt. Peppers\u2019 Lonely Hearts Club Band,\u201d Aretha Franklin, Buffalo Springfield, Cream, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Frank Zappa, Jimi Hendrix, Van Morrison, Leonard Cohen and \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d. 1968 was the year both Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated. The year was represented musically by Joni Mitchell, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Deep Purple, Steppenwolf and \u201cHey Jude.\u201d 1969 included The Band, Blind Faith, Blood Sweat and Tears, Chicago, Crosby Stills and Nash, the Moon Landing and the Woodstock Festival. 1970 saw the end of the Beatles, the Rock Opera \u201cTommy,\u201d the Allman Brothers, James Gang, Santana, Elton John, James Taylor and Neil Young. Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix all died of drug overdoses. 1971 involved Emerson Lake and Palmer, Fleetwood Mac, Carole King, Todd Rundgren, Cat Stevens and the Carpenters. 1972 marked the Watergate break-in, the Doobie Brothers, the Eagles, Steely Dan and Paul Simon. 1973 was represented by Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Aerosmith, Queen, Edgar Winter and Earth Wind and Fire. 1974 saw President Richard Nixon resign and the rise of Billie Joel, Atlanta Rhythm Section, Average White Band and Supertramp. 1975 was represented by the Eagles, Hall and Oates and John Denver..

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, I think the 1980s had the best variety of music even if a lot of individuals found many songs from this era \u2018cheesy\u2019 (don\u2019t even get me started on the fashion :P). I would say that the 70s were the peak of rock music but the 80s were the peak of pop with artists such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Whitney Houston etc. There were some good rock bands out there such as Queen, Van Halen, Dire Straits, AC/DC, INXS, Journey, Guns n Roses and many many more. And let\u2019s not forget the huge trend of Hair Metal that erupted in this decade with artists such as 80s Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, Dokken, Poison, Twisted Sister etc. Even if this genre was criticised by certain people due to the lyrics containing a lot of sexual innuendo, this particular genre still has some pretty good songs. Let\u2019s not forget the emergence of hip hop and rap. Artists such as N.W.A, Run-DMC, Beastie Boys, Public enemy etc. Kickstarted a whole new genre that would still be popular and \u2018trending\u2019 today. Last but not least, the 80s were responsible for initiating a new metal movement with genres such as Thrash Metal, Death Metal and Black Metal that would later influence other bands. Some bands include: Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Death, Venom, Celtic Frost, Bathory, Obituary, Morbid Angel, Napalm Death, Testament, Mercyful fate, Kreator, Exodus and many more. Now I know there are a lot more genres that were prominent in this era, but I covered the ones that I thought had the biggest impact till today. ",
