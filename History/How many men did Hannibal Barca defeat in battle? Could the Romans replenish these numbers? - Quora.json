            "answer_text": "Rome did enjoy a significant manpower advantage over its Punic invaders. We have recorded numbers of legions from 216 BC and onward. 12 legions in 215 BC, 18 in 214 BC, and 25 in 211 BC. One legion was made up of 1,200 velites, 1,200 hastati, 1,200 principes, 600 triarii and 300 cavalry. That is a theoretical strength of at least 105,000 Roman infantry and 7,500 cavalry, supported by at least an equal number of auxiliaries called Socii in 211 BC. Let's take a look at the number of men killed and captured. Battle of Ticinus 218 BC: 2,300 men lostBattle of Trebia 218 BC: 32,000 men lostBattle of Lake Trasimene 217 BC: 30,000 men lostBattle of Aeger Falernus 217 BC: 1,000 men lostBattle of Geronium 217 BC: 7,000 men lostBattle of Cannae 216 BC: 80,000 men lostTotal number of men killed or captured: 152,300 In 215 BC the Romans had 12 legions and auxiliaries left, approximately 108,000 men of a total force of 260,300 men in 218 BC. In other words, Hannibal killed or captured almost 1/3 of their standing army at Cannae. Despite these heavy loses, the Romans raised 6 new legions and auxiliaries in 214 BC, 54,000 men, and increased the standing army to 162,000 men. Hannibal continues to defeat the Romans in battle. Battle of Tarentum 212 BC: 13,000 men lostFirst battle of Capua 212 BC: 1,500 men lostBattle of Silarus 212 BC: 15,000 men lost1st Battle of Herdonia 212 BC: 16,000 men lost In 211 BC the Romans had 25 legions and auxiliaries, 7 legions more than in 214 BC, approximately 225,000 men all together, so Hannibal managed to kill or capture 45,500 men during the same time it took the Romans to raise 13 legions and auxiliaries, or 117,000 men, so they were one step ahead of him. Now the Romans had lost 197,800 men as a total. The remaining force in 215 BC was 108,000 men and the new force in 211 BC numbered some 117,000 men. That is a total of 422,800 men if we include the defeated men, and still they had more to draw from. Hannibal continued to win. Battle of Castulo and Ilorca 211 BC: 20,000 men lost to Hasdrubal Barca2nd Battle of Herdonia 210 BC: 13,000 men lostBattle of Canusium 209 BC: 5,700 killed In all Hannibal killed or captured a total of at least 216,500 men, just short of half their force. If they were unable to raise new soldiers the way they did, they would have lost after Cannae. The total force was 260,300 and Hannibal and Hasdrubal managed to killed or captured 236,500. That is only theoretically 23,800 left of the original force to guard Italy, defend against Philip V and attack the Iberian peninsula. With depleted numbers after Cannae they could not have gone on the offensive in Italy or Spain in 212 BC and onward. Hannibal could not afford to lose 236,500 men and win. The Romans could. Scipio Africanus came later, and these events follow a timeline, so by 215, without the Roman manpower reserve, Hannibal's brothers would have been able to reinforce him in Italy (which they failed to do in 214 BC). With new men Hannibal could have besieged cities, defended conquered cities and maintain a standing army at the same time. ",

            "answer_text": "Hammibal was one of the greatest generals in all of history. He lived from 257 BC to 183/181 BC. As for how many Romans were defeated in battle, it really is unknown. It should be how many soldiers were killed in battle, because a soldier defeated, can still fight another day. Battle of Trebia: 26 to 28,000 killed Lake Trasimene: 15,000 killed, 15,000 captured. Battle of Geronium: There were 2 parts to the battle, a skirmish, 5,000 dead, the actual battle, exact number unknown, but in the 1000\u2019s Battle of Cannae: 75,000 to 85,000 killed, captured 10,000 Battle of Solaris: 15,000 killed Battle of Herdonia: 16,000 killed (212 BC) Battle of Herdonia: 7 to 13,000 killed (210 BC) Battle of Canusium: 5,700 killed Battle of Zama, Africa: 5,000, A Roman victory. I have taken the low number where ever it is given, and with that, it tallies out at about 160,000 Romans killed, between 218 BC to 202BC. The actual number is way above 160,000, as there were many smaller battles, and I left those numbers out, as Omer callous person might say, After the first 160,000, dose really matter. Again remember, I took the low numbers. As for the second part of your question, in 202BC, Rome was able to bring a force of, 35,500 Romans, and Numidians together to defeat Hannibal who had a force of 40,000. One questioned not asked was, Why, after Hannibal killed so many Romans, was he driven off the Italian Pennsula? Because, he only had so many men, even with Italians that joined him, and while he would kill thousands of Romans, he still lost many irreplaceable men himself. It was a war of attrition, which Roman finally won. ",
