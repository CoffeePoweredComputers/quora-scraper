            "answer_text": "Quite the reverse Eating fresh fruit is really a 20th century thing. In the 18th century, most fruit would have been processed into alcohol or turned into preserves (the hint is in the name). By the 19th, they had developed canning technology, so fruit could have been put into cans for later consumption. Meats? Mostly processed so they wouldn\u2019t go bad, so bacon, sausage and ham. If you were rich. In the 17th century, most people would have access to fresh milk, but no refrigeration, so you couldn\u2019t store it except as cheese (which was popular) or butter. By the 18th, there were no farms in big cities, so no milk. That didn\u2019t re-arrive until the railway was developed. Vegetables? Seasonal or pickled. Again, canned vegetables started to appear in the 18th century. The potato was a big boon -it would keep for months in the right conditions. And talk about local foods! That was it. If it didn\u2019t grow within travel distance of where you lived, forget it. No bananas unless you lived in the tropics. You most likely would have consumed a lot more salt because it was used to preserve meat. And, if you were well off, there was processed sugar. That was available in the 17th century too. It keeps pretty much forever if its kept dry. It\u2019s also how you made preserves. Of course, bread was very big and probably would have made up the majority of your dietary calories. Maybe with some butter or preserves. There were also other fat alternatives, like lard and tallow. Vegetable oil was hard to get at this point. Cottonseed oil was common in the 18th century as a by-product of cotton production, but oil seed like canola was rarely grown. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWas the typical American diet healthier in the 18th and 19th centuries?\u201d Well, it is rather a mixed bag. One the one hand we have far more access to nutritious foods today than people had in the 18th or 19th centuries. As much as we think hunger is a serious issue today it was even easier for people to starve to death in previous centuries. The poor often subsisted on very simple foods without much nutrition. Diseases caused by malnutrition were very common. On the other hand, we today have more access to highly refined foods than people could possibly have imagined in early America. The fact that a poor person today can become obese from overeating sugary, starchy, cholesterol-rich foods is a testament to how radically foods have changed in the last couple of centuries. Today malnutrition is far less common (though not unheard of) in America, but instead diseases associated with over-consumption of unhealthy foods have become very prevalent. ",
