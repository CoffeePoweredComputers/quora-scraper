            "answer_text": "We have been speculating about the cause of Henry VIII\u2019s death for nearly 500 years. The truth is, we will never know what finally brought about Henry\u2019s death. Even if permission was given to exhume his body and his DNA could be tested, we still would not know definitively. There are valid reasons to believe he had a number of diseases. He was certainly morbidly obese. We know of the great wound in his leg and the jousting accidents. Did he have diabetes or sepsis? Gout? Cushing Disease? Did he have a pulmonary embolism or a brain aneurysm? Was it a stroke, a heart attack, or had his body, riddled as it seems by various diseases and ailments, just given out? The mean life expectancy of kings of Scotland and England, reigning from 1000 A.D. to 1600 A.D., were 51 and 48 years respectively. When Henry died, 28 January 1547, at the age of 55, he had actually outlived his life expectancy. Henry VIII was larger than life, literally and figuratively. There has never been a king like him. His six wives and the break with Rome are forever etched in the collective consciousness. Henry VIII remains so very alive in our minds, it is hard to fathom that his heart just stopped beating and he died. He was a mere mortal, like the rest of us. \u201cDeath comes equally to us all, and makes us equal when it comes\u201d. John Donne  ",

            "answer_text": "Henry may have suffered from McLeod syndrome, a genetic disorder specific to the Kell blood group, it would finally provide an explanation for his shift in both physical form and personality and may also explain why only his first born children, all from different mothers were able to survived. A Kell-positive father frequently is the cause behind the inability of his partner to bear a healthy infant after the first Kell-negative pregnancy, which is precisely the circumstance experienced with women who had multiple pregnancies by Henry. The majority of individuals within the Kell blood group are Kell negative, so it is the rare Kell-positive father that creates reproductive problems. Inability to walk consistent with McLeod syndromeBy middle age, the King suffered from chronic leg ulcers, fueling longstanding historical speculation that he suffered from type II diabetes. The ulcers also could have been caused by osteomyelitis, a chronic bone infection that would have made walking extremely painful. ",
