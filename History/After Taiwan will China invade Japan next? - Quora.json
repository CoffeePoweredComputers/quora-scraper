            "answer_text": "very unlikely. china's dispute with Taiwan has always been internal. KMT(Kuo Min Tang /China Nationalist Party) was the ruling party for the whole of china during world war 2 and they lost the civil war to the current CCP(china communist party) in 1949, the KMT moved their remaining forces to Taiwan and governed it as the Republic of China(Taiwan) the ROC was actually one of the founders of the UN assembly until it was replaced in 1971 by the PRC (CCP). The CCP has always tried to invade Taiwan, but they lack the equipment to do it, First Taiwan Strait Crisis - Wikipedia, Second Taiwan Strait Crisis - Wikipedia. Going back to will China invade japan? that is a different situation Japan is a sovereign country and recognized by the world. and ally to the US. If China declares war on Japan then the US has to intervene and the US will bring its allies to the fray. So it\u2019s a very unlikely scenario, it will only happen if the leader of the CCP is mentally retarded. ",

            "answer_text": "No. What does China want from Japan? Nothing. If China\u2019s goal is to dominate East Asia, then it only needs Japan to become a Chinese ally and less of an American ally. BTW, China also wants South Korea to be the same way. That would make Northeast Asia China\u2019s sphere of influence. What is Taiwan\u2019s role in this? If the U.S. does nothing more than imposing a sanction for a few years after China invades Taiwan, then two things will happen. American commitment, whether will or capability, to defend Japan (or South Korea) against enemies will be questioned in Japan and SK. That would make being a Chinese ally politically more appealing.PLA will be positioned to blockade import to Japan, and it can also interdict traffic between Japan and the Philippines, the twin pillar of American military bases in East Asia. This also puts pressure on Japan to be more friendly with China.China may even broker the unification of NK and SK provided the unified country become a Chinese ally. Without the support of Japan and with Taiwan in the hands of PLA, the U.S. would be in a weak position to oppose this development in the Korean peninsula. And all of these starts with the possession of Taiwan by PRC. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Japan has a formidable navy, the best in Asia. And if one thing history teaches us is that if you\u2019re going to fight the Japanese on their turf you better be sure and ready. It took two nuclear bombs to get them to surrender during WW2 because after the destruction of Hiroshima the Japanese were still willing to fight. And in Nagasaki, 1 month after the nuclear blast flattened the city, the trams were up and running again. In the 13 century when the mongols steamrolled and conquered the whole of Asia and with all their resources at hand they hit a rock when they tried to invade Japan twice and twice suffered humiliating defeats. Circa: 150,000 dead mongols and 4,000 mongol ships destroyed in both attempted invasion with minimal casualties for Japan The japanese might have softened up a little since WW2 and have an ageing population but they are still a warrior nation and they can fight. It\u2019s in their DNA. Banza\u00ef ! ",

Just visit any Chinese political forum, article comments, and social media. All the venomous aggression is openly allowed and encouraged by the CCP, without censorship. Bombing, invading, and raping of Japanese. It\u2019s all there. Very easy to find. ",
