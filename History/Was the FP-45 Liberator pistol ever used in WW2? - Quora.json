            "answer_text": "While Its certianly true that the FP-45 Liberator was manufactured during WW2, we don\u2019t really know how frequently It was used during the war.  FP-45 Liberator This was due to the fact that the resistance rarely kept detailed documents should they be caught.  Resistance However, we do know that It wasn\u2019t very popular with the higher-ups of the allied command.  Allies Wikipedia states the following: General Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff never saw the practicality in mass dropping the Liberator over occupied Europe, and authorized distribution of fewer than 25,000 of the half million FP-45 pistols shipped to Great Britain for the French resistance. Generals Joseph Stilwell and Douglas MacArthur were similarly unenthusiastic about the other half of the pistols scheduled for shipment to the Pacific. The Army then turned 450,000 Liberators over to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which preferred to supply Resistance fighters in both theatres with more effective weapons whenever possible. -FP-45 Liberator - Wikipedia This was due to the fact that there is a much better alternative to the FP-45 Liberator. And that is the STEN.  STEN The STEN was a crude and effective sub-machine gun that could easily be produced by an underground resistance workshops. While the same can be said of the FP-45 Liberator, there are several drawbacks to the FP-45 Liberator that made It unattractive to both allied higher-ups and resistance members alike. The first drawback is the most obvious, which is the fact that the FP-45 Liberator can only hold one round. And after firing the gun, you need to extract out the spent cartridge using a rod, before replacing It with a fresh round.  FP-45 Liberator reload This is extremely time-consuming, which means It would be sucidal to uuse the FP-45 Liberator in close quarters combat, which, ironically, was the type of fighting It was meant for. And secondly, the Americans chambered It in .45ACP, a caliber that is used only by the americans most of time.  .45ACP This was perharps the silliest aspect of the gun, as resistance fighters often had poor access to ammo, which meant they had to scavenge from enemy troops.  Enemy troop This meant that they would have been using calibers like the 9mm Luger instead .45ACP, so even if you wanted to use the FP-45 Liberator, you couldn\u2019t obtain the ammo for It easily.  9mm Luger This was unlike other weapons supplied to the resistance from the allies, which often came chambered in Axis ammo and sometimes coule accept Axis parts, such as the STEN accepting MP40 magazines.  MP40 Magazines And finally, the FP-45 Liberator was meant as a throw-away weapon. Wikipedia states the following: It was originally intended as an insurgency weapon to be mass dropped behind enemy lines to resistance fighters in occupied territory. A resistance fighter was to recover the gun, sneak up on an Axis occupier, kill or incapacitate him, and retrieve his weapons. -FP-45 Liberator - Wikipedia This completely mitgated the FP-45 Liberator as frontline weapons that weren\u2019t meant to be thrown away was already sent to the resistance, such as the STEN.  Resistance fighter with STEN Hence, the FP-45 Liberator was used during WW2, but records of Its use was sparse due to the resistance keeping poor records and the fact that there were better weapons than the FP-45 Liberator being supplied to the resistance at the same time. That\u2019s all folks! ",

            "answer_text": "FP-45 Liberator - Wikipedia Not many of them were actually dropped into anywhere. \u2018French use of the FP-45 remains undocumented, however a first hand account of an assassination with an FP-45 exists from German military policeman Niklaus Lange. He claimed that there were thousands in circulation in occupied France.\u2019 Most likely a few times it was used to kill someone in a occupied nation during or after WW2, but most of them were destroyed. If they was a major overthrow of the governments of Europe (like maybe a Islamic revolt to enforce Sharia law), I wouldn't be surprised to find a modern version of the Liberator pistol dropped into Europe again.
