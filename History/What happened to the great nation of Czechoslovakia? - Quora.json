            "answer_text": "Oh, the great nation of Czechoslovakia of 1929\u2026 1st, Great Depression happened, reviving by then dead and burried dislike of German minority towards Czechoslovakia, in 19292nd, Hitler came to power in Germany, and populist and racist propaganda via German language radio stations over the border boosted this dislike3rd Great Britain and France happened, at Munich betrayal, destroying Czechoslovakia, and reviving Slovak fear of Hungarian colonization of Slovakia, making them distance themselves from Czechoslovakia and strike an alliance with Hitler4th, Germany happened, in 1939.5th, Second World war happened, damaging a lot of infrastructure, killing a lot of people, including imporatant Jewish minority6th, Great Britain, France, and USA happened, deciding Czechoslovakia should be given to Stalin post WW2, if he in exchange lets West keep Greece 6.5 Expulsion of Germans by Czechoslovakia happened. After WW2, Czechs really couldn\u2019t stand Germans[except a minority who could prove beyond doubt they were anti-nazi, or, like all countries after WW2 did, talented nazis who were of use] in their country, and since Germany lost not only the war, but also moral ground, the expulsion was quite brutal, with some 3 000 000 Germans forced out of country claiming 20 000\u201330 000 victims (depending on how many suicides do you think were caused by expulsion and how many were nazis who just couldn\u2019t stand that Germany lost the war).7th, Communist unconstitutional power grab happened, in 1948, supported by USSR8th, Communism happened, in 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s, executing Czechoslovak elites, pushing a lot of elites out of country.9th, When it seemed like Prague Spring - Wikipedia was coming to Czechoslovakia, guess what, USSR said no and sent Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia - Wikipedia. France, Britain, USA - did nothing, just offered some silent disaproval.10th, Normalization (Czechoslovakia) - Wikipedia happened, under the guidance of USSR. 11th, after Velvet Revolution - Wikipedia Czechoslovakia suddenly found itself free again, though with now outdated industry and need to rebuild itself. While this allowed it to trade with new Western allies, and rapidly recover, at the same time it also wasn\u2019t as if Western help was some kind of benevolent force. Lot of especially German companies used the opportunity and took over some big name Czech companies - \u0160koda being most telling example. While this took over had short term benefits - rapid improvement of industrial tools, modernization, and elevation of \u0160koda to the Western standards, this also had drawbacks in long term - the \u0160koda is no longer Czech company, and completely in hands of German Wolkswagen, who can now decide to abandon Czech republic and go to, say, Turkey, VW's production of Passat, Superb models in Turkey to excite competition in Europe. 12th, Slovaks wanted their own independence. After communism, relationships of Czechs and Slovaks within Czechoslovakia were strained by politics and Slovaks decided to go their own way. This helped restore relations between Czechs and Slovaks to become brotherly again. However, it was also the end of Czechoslovakia. ",

            "answer_text": "Czechoslovakia was not a nation It was a federation state of two nations - Czechs and Slovaks, hence the name. Czechs spoke Czech in the Czech area and Slovaks spoke Slovak in the Slovak area. The media broadcasts were mixed. Every Czech and Slovak was able to understand the other language. There was one president but two prime ministers - czech and slovak. Czechs and Slovaks were evolving separately for more than thousand years before they created a common federation. They joined togeter with a common goal - Czechs getting independent from the Austrain Empire and Slovaks getting independent from the Hungarian Empire. They had different mentality and opinions. Czechoslovakia got peacefully dissolved due to those differences and split into independent Czechia (Czech Republic) and Slovakia (Slovak Republic) To know more, read my (more detailed) answer to For what reason(s) did Czechs and Slovaks go different ways and decide to separate? Quora is full of similar threads. And also, to read more about why did Czechs and Slovaks decided to create Czechoslovakia and break off from the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy, read my answer to How did Czechoslovakia come into existence? Was it a voluntary union of Czechs and Slovaks or Czechia simply annexed Slovak-inhabited parts of the Kingdom of Hungary? Again, Quora is spammed with these questions and answers ",
