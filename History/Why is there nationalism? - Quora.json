            "answer_text": "Because when people can not see the greater truth or bigger picture, irrational fears rule and it becomes impossible to see beyond a nation, a religion, a family or one self. Nationalism is a product of fear, and lack of truth. Nazism which is one of the more nationalistic systems we have had, is a good example of this and the lies, fear and propaganda which existed in this system which had a very physical and materialistic way of looking at things while leaving virtually no room for anything deeper such as love, the metaphysical, spirituality or greater individuality. Therefore it was the most destructive system we have known. Nationalism exist because nations exist, which exist because of the need to own land and water and control resources and people, a materialistic focus which is what is behind all wars, slavery, poverty, greed, fear, hate, sex crimes and really divisions in general. The root actually lie in peoples lack of faith in love, greater consciousness, altruism and the metaphysical such as is found in both religion and atheism where you have division, focus on the physical, fears, need for control, materialism, small unit families and a general small perspective. The antidote is true, altruism, spirituality, love, theism, quantum physics, unified thinking of solidarity which is a higher form of consciousness. But we can only get to that state when we shift the values away from the physical need and greed, to the spiritual want, love and desire for good. Where choice is not just about survival or competing with others for limited resources, but instead about happiness, truth, love and a life where people are moved by desire with the metaphysical where everything such as truth, love and happiness becomes better the more it is shared.As long as there is religion and atheism there will be some sort of nationalism, but we will have to shift from this way of thinking if the human race is going to last in the long run.
