            "answer_text": "\u201cSolitary.\u201d Sorry, I know not everyone can spell, but if you\u2019re going to refer to yourself with that phrase, you should be able to spell it. I\u2019m going to give you a very real, very direct set of parameters about being what I assume is a secular witch. For being a secular solitary witch, you will need the following, and this is a minimum list, so you need every single thing on it. At least 5, and better if it\u2019s 10, hours a week where you will be completely undisturbed and undistracted, in order to study. Witchcraft is something that must be studied very regularly, and very intensively.Access to RECOMMENDED books on witchcraft, history, etymology (knowing the roots of the words you use is a must), folklore, cultural anthropology, herbalism, and any subjects that fall under the umbrella term, \u201cwitchcraft\u201d which interest you. These might include, but may not necessarily include, the following (not all witches study every one of these, but we do try to be well rounded): divination, astrology, augury, potion (infusion, decoction, distillation, etc.) making, domestic witchery, dowsing, textile crafts, candle and soap making, ritual magics, poetry and incantation, sigil magic, ritual tool making, reading dead languages and alphabets, psychic development, astral projection, astral temple building, use, and maintenance, oracular work, and many other subjects.Most books on Wicca today are utter garbage. If you want to learn Wicca, the way you learn it is by studying with an initiated, preferably third degree teacher. Wicca is taught in person and practiced in groups.Access to a large amount of paper on which to take your notes. Some modern witches do use electronic means to keep their notes. However, writing by hand is an important tool for ingesting the information.The self-direction to slog through some fairly dry, academic reading. You will be reading dry dissertations of the study of folklore, for instance. Etymology, a very key and often ignored study of the history and trajectory of languages, is key to writing articulate incantations. Being able to read academic level works is absolutely necessary to being a truly educated witch. Sure, some witches don\u2019t study that. They don\u2019t get invited to my parties, though.The privacy to store tools, books, writings, and more so as to not leave them out for others who shouldn\u2019t see them to see.The ability to see connections between topics that the average person doesn\u2019t see. The ability to develop discernment is key to being a witch. Here\u2019s an article I wrote on Quora on the subject of discernment: Kristin Barton's post in Real WiccaSo here\u2019s the real deal. MANY people love to say they\u2019re a witch, and less than half of those people are actual witches. Witchcraft isn\u2019t \u201cwhatever you want it to be.\u201d Witchcraft isn\u2019t a hobby, nor is it an aesthetic, nor is it something you pick up without years of regular study, and study of the right sources, as many sources are written and published by the unqualified. If you\u2019re shopping in a metaphysical shop for basics, you aren\u2019t educated enough yet to practice. The only reason that truly qualified witches shop in metaphysical shops is to support local Pagan businesses. We make most of our tools, and/or purchase them from other witches who make them for ritual use. If you have what it takes to be a witch, instead of cosplaying and playacting being a witch, then welcome aboard. We are few, indeed. ",
