            "answer_text": "Your question has a forgone conclusion \u2014 that President Trump and his \u201cadvisor\u201d believe the continuing embargo does not hurt Cuban Citizens. How would you know that he/they do or do not believe this? From photos of this \u201csocialist paradise,\u201d we know they continue to drive 60 year old US automobiles. I don\u2019t exactly know where the fuel comes from for those cars \u2014 or repair parts. Major trading partners with the US don\u2019t provide them to Cuba. Trump\u2019s logic is that Cuba was and is a hostile nation to the US and one that exports anti American sentiment and practice elsewhere. This is known to be true, to places such as Venezuela and some African countries. The US continues to allow export of food and medicine to Cuba. The shipments are paid for in cash; no credit. Don\u2019t forget, Cuba nationalized without payment four oil refineries and other businesses owned by Americans. There are something like $6 billion in claims against Cuba still pending. While it is said that billions of dollars would be gained between the countries if the embargo was lifted, it is far from clear that the Cuban citizens would be positively affected. Do not trivialize or forget that Cuba is a communist/Marxist country. The state controls all and the individual has no say in it. I\u2019ll speak for myself: While it isn\u2019t clear that the embargo has done anything so wonderful for the United States, it hasn\u2019t particularly hurt the Cubans, either. So from a \u201chumanitarian\u201d point of view, it is a non issue. It is a political issue and so long as Cuban adventurists can negatively affect other Latin American countries, there is no reason to provide them with foreign exchange which, in the long run would be detrimental to our own interests. That reminds me: Consider Puerto Rico. They have a crummy government, they don\u2019t know if they want to become an independent nation, a US state, or continue as a territory. The $29 billion sent them as hurricane relief was more than their yearly GNP. Where did that money go? It was wasted, stolen, squandered. If they become an independent country, it will be about 2 minutes before Cuba starts taking it over and exports its brand of communism. No, we need not enable Cuba. President Tump is 100% correct. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s quite the contrary, embargo\u2019s are made to hurt the population to the point of such despair that they will want to overthrow their own government! So the narrative that they don\u2019t think it hurt the population is non existent! It\u2019s not just Cuba, any country that tried to establish a social or agrarian reform, redistribution of wealth in Latin America was sabotage, overthrown of put under sanctions by the USA! There were over 80 coups and government overthrown in Latin America and all were done by the USA with the exception of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and Cuba (and even there the cia was arming Castro for the last year of the revolution). No \u201cSocial democracy\u201d was ever allowed to prosper, not just because to do so american companies couldn\u2019t get their cut of those economies,(roughly 35% of gdp), but also so Americans wouldn\u2019t start questioning their own capitalism that doesn\u2019t offer them any of those benefits! It have always been the policy of the us government to keep Latin America as a piggy bank, there is much more money to be made by supporting dictatorship and authoritarian governments (under the guise of fighting communism, terrorism, socialism,etc) than there is to support \u201cSocially minded capitalist democracies\u201d. This is why we now see all of the protests throughout Latin America right now, every American government have applied the same policy, to different degrees but all have! And non is robbing Latin America more than the Trump administration, not since Nixon and Reagan have we seeing such a grab of resources through coups, law fare, corruption and straight out robbery! It\u2019s very shameful but also very american! ",
