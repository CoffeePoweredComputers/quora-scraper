            "answer_text": "The effects of a Carrington level storm would likely be in between the effects listed by John Wo and Steve Zara, PhD. A \u201cCarrington level\u201d storm\u2019s CME effects could reach Earth in 9 to 18 hours, not 4 days as John Wo indicated. There are mitigating effects that would be implemented, but it is unlikely all mitigation efforts would occur, and some damage would occur regardless, though some mitigation efforts WOULD reduce the damage. World wide effects would ensue, but it would not kill \u201chundreds\" of millions as Steve Zara indicated. For one thing some regions of the US and even Southern Europe, would not receive nearly as much damage to their grids. Specifically, more damage would happen North of 40 deg Latidude, and South of 40 Deg S Latidude. Also the area under the South Atlantic Anomaly in Northern South America could have moderately damaging effects. In the US, the Southern States could help Northern States effected. The electrical grid in the NorthEast Corridor, from New Jersey North, is also more vulnerable to damage as it is not a well designed against the solar EMP slow long wave effects. The effects would be bad, and a world wide disaster, but not a catastrophic disaster ending modern civilization as some have depicted. It could still cost 2 or 3 trillion in damages, sure. However that's not civilization ending. How likely In the next 20 years is a Carrrington Level storm ??? Likely no more than 0.5 %. Why. The Carrington Event was a 1,000 year solar storm. The last stronger storm, 50% stronger than the Carrington Event happened in the late 8th Century. So 20 years is 1/50th of 1000. So why not a 2% chance ? Because the solar cycle is waning. The last high end of the Solar Cycle was 2010 through 2014. 2012 was a dud\u2026Sorry Hollywood. The Myans didn't get everything right. This next sunspot cycle is expected to be less than the one before it with an estimated 80 to 130 sunspots. It should be starting up right now, the end of 2019. Some have wondered if we may be heading for another Maunder minimum, where the sun is quiet for 50 to 80 years. Too early to tell. We have learned a lot about solar dynamics in the last 30 years. However, the sun could still surprise with a mega flare, but even with a repeat Carrington event, we would have 9 hours to perhaps 18 hours to take precautions. After a flare, withing an hour we would know the speed of the protons released by the CME. The record is 9+ hours to reach Earth. By the way, electronics are NOT directly affected, even by a Carrington level solar storm. That does not matter however, if there is no power\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "So\u2026 back when the original Carrington Event occurred - we really didn\u2019t have much idea about Coronal Mass Ejections and how they might affect the Earth. Since then, however - we\u2019ve figured out quite a bit\u2026 When a CME erupts off the sun, the ions in the ejection approach Earth at about a million miles an hour\u2026 so - we have about 4 days warning before it gets here. When it impacts Earth, it makes our magnetic field twist and bend - which creates huge voltage potentials in power grids and electronics - which can cause transformers to explode, and powerplants to go off line, and damage to satellites. These things still happen, but we keep a careful watch on the sun with several satellites to warn us of these events. A large one - like what happened in 1859 - is difficult to predict\u2026 it\u2019s sort of like predicting an Earthquake - we can tell when one is *likely*, but not if it will occur. But - if one *does* occur\u2026 there will be some issues, but it would be an inconvenience, not catastrophic. ",
