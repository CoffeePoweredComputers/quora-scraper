            "answer_text": "There seems to be a general belief that if a global conflict erupts, it will inevitably turn nuclear. That\u2019s certainly a possibility\u2014and a truly terrifying one\u2014but I can envision scenarios in which a widespread global conflict occurs without nuclear weapons being deployed. It comes down to what you mean by \u201cworld war\u201d. If we go by the first two world wars\u2014or three, because there are good arguments that the Seven Years War, in the late Eighteenth Century, was fought in many parts of the globe and constitutes a \u201cworld war\u201d\u2014then WW3 could involve a conventional conflict that happens to involve fighting in many parts of the world. In WW2, for example, the bulk of the fighting occurred in Europe and the western Soviet Union, North Africa and the Mediterranean, parts of China and Southeast Asia, and much of the Pacific basin excluding the Americas (yes, I know the Japanese attacked the U.S. with a submarine, and some incendiary balloons), and much of the northern Atlantic basin. That\u2019s certainly a big chunk of the world, but it excludes most of North and South America, most of Africa and much of Asia. So, we can confidently say a \u201cworld war\u201d needs to have conflicts occur around the world, but not literally involving all of it. Given this, we could have a \u201cworld war\u201d involving the United States and some allies on one side; the other side would likely have to involve China and/or Russia, or these two nations would need to be involved in some way, anyway. No other nations really have the means, or the potential means, to project power very far from their homeland, so a conflict with any of them would likely be regional (but could escalate). Such a conflict could involve combat in places like the Korean Peninsula, parts of Europe, parts of the Middle East, perhaps parts of Africa and southern Asia, and the Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins. The scale of destruction would probably be such that such a conflict would be intense, but of relatively short duration; I doubt that we\u2019d see a years-long conflict like previous world wars, that heavily engages the combatants economically and socially for long periods of time. So what would be the consequences? Well, if we assume a relatively brief and intense conflict in several theaters, that doesn\u2019t involve the deployment of nuclear weapons, then we\u2019d likely see: -a breakdown in global trade. The global economy would suffer terribly; many national economies would collapse and we\u2019d certainly see global recession and possibly depression. We would probably suffer through severe economic disruption for years; -the collapse of global telecommunications. Between infrastructure damage, and the possible use of weapons designed to destroy satellites, blind sensors, etc. we\u2019d likely find our cellular and other networks severely disrupted. Some parts of the world would fare worse, others not so much and would probably recover more quickly; -a complete disruption of global politics and diplomacy. Depending on the outcome of the conflict, governments could collapse, revolutions could occur, countries could fragment and new and (at least initially) unstable national entities could arise. For example, if Russia fought and was on the losing side, the existing government could fall, while ethnic and nationalist tensions could cause parts of the country to declare independence. It might take years, or even decades, for anything like a stable global political climate to re-emerge; -severe environmental damage. Damage to infrastructure could lead to chemical and other spills; the destruction of nuclear-powered ships and submarines could leave uncontained nuclear reactors and their fuel \u201cat large\u201d in the world\u2019s oceans. Even the destruction of conventionally-fueled ships could lead to massive fuel and oil spills. Cleaning these up would probably not be an immediate priority\u2014certainly while the conflict is ongoing\u2014and may take a long time to clean up after the cessation of hostilities; -opportunists\u2014both nation-states, and non-state actors like terrorist and other groups\u2014would likely take advantage of the chaos to advance all sorts of agendae. If the major powers are distracted from regional tensions like the Koreas or the Middle East, then those players may make moves that erupt into regional wars (which would, themselves, have all sorts of knock-on effects). I could probably go on, but the bottom line really is that, even if a single nuclear weapon isn\u2019t detonated, a global conflict today would be MASSIVELY disruptive, VERY painful in many ways and have effects that would last for decades. Our world may LOOK largely the same, but it would probably be a very different, much poorer and far more unstable place. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s say World War III starts now for any reason. I going to assume that the US declares war on Russia for rigging the elections. First, Coronavirus dosen\u2019t exist in this alternate timeline. Second, I am 80% positive that Nuclear weapons will not be used, although not a large quantity. Third, these wars will be different from the past 2 World Wars. Fourth, The aim of this war is not to conquer land, it is to advance their own religion, beliefs, form of government in different countries. NOTE: THIS IS WRITTEN FOR ENTERTAINMENT Stage 1: Beginning of war Continuing the storyline, The US has just declared war on Russia. They attack Eastern Siberia with B-52s, crippling industry there and killing civilans. Russia responds by carpet bombing States on the west coast, killing millions. At this point, alliances start to form. The Stock Market closes and the economy suffers miserably. Russia, India,Turkey,Iran,Iraq,etc form an alliance against the US and it\u2019s countries. Cuba are friendly with the Russians, so the US neutralize them quickly before they can pose a serious threat or that Russia can use Cuba as a place to launch an invasion. The Middle East Russian friendly countries start attacking Isreal and Saudi Arabia in the Middle East. Isreal and Saudi Arabia go out to the US for help and they gain troops,the majority of the US army since a full frontal invasion of Russia is unrealistic at this time. The Middle East is a heavily contested theater of war right now. South Korea(allied with the US) ends uneasy peace with the North Koreans and they start attacking each other. Russia pores in war material to North Korea, The US already spent the vast majority of their assets in the Middle East, so the only give monetary assists to South Korea. Korea is at war, but it is clear that North Korea has the distinct advantage. Meanwhile, The US mobilize their fleet to monitor the protect their coastline and occupy The Sea Of China to make sure tha China dont get involvewd in the war. Russia also sets border defense against China as Russia and The US are unsure which side China is on. China is leaning towards supporting Russia, as they have a better relationship with them then they have the US. The US and Russia continue bombing each other, with spies constantly being activated in each others countries. So, to summarize Stage 1: Middle East is a bloodbath, with Iran,Iraq,India,Afghastian attacking Isreal and Saudi Arabia. North Korea and South Korea are fighting. US and Russia are keeping a close eye on China, who are currently neutral. Stage 2: China joins Russia. The US worst fears become true. China immediatly begins trade with Russia and pours in war material to the Middle East and Koreas, the two main theaters of war. The European countries pour in more troops and war material, but it is too late. Isreal and Saudi Arabia are losing ground rapidly and have adopted defensive circles around their main cities. In a last ditch attempt to defend their cities from mass destruction, Isreal release 5 nukes bombing major cities of the Pro-Russian countries. It works well at first, but soon the Pro-Russians start killing Israli citizens and demand that Isreal stops Nuking their major countries or all the Israli citizens in the towns that they conqured would die\u201d Faced with a dillema whether to continue fighting or surrender, while the Isreal government work it out, Pro-Russian forces bomb the main Israli cities. After they can no longer endure fighting the war, Isreal surrenders. This prompts Saudi to do the same after they suffered similar. Isreal and Saudi had to pay an Oil tribute to the Middle East countries and permantily disband their militaries. With no choice, they complied. North Korea also subdue South Korea into submission and South Korea and North Korea unify, creating a single Korea who end fighting for their respective sides and work on rebuilding their country. Meanwhile, Russia decides that now is the time to advance their agenda. They start invading Poland,Ukraine and Finland which all the countries their put up a good fight, but are no match for the Russian war machine and become Russian land. Anti-US sentiment also grows in Europe as they were the ones who brought this war to them. Seeing the war already lost, all European countries pull out of the war and remain neutral. American spies report that Russia does not plan to invade the US, but force them to surrender. To summarize Stage 2: Saudi Arabia and Isreal surrender, no longer the domintent powers in the Middle East. Korea unifies. China joins Russia. European countries stop supplying troops to the US Stage 3: The US realize they have lost the war, but attempt to salvage something out of nothing. War fatigue sets in on both sides and now most people want a treaty between the two powers. The US submits a surrender request. The Russians and The US briefly argue about treaty conditions, but eventually agree on that the US surrenders and agrees that all naval forces retreat back to 100,000 feet from American Soil and that the US reduce their nuclear bomb capacity by 30%. Overall War Cost: 15 Trillion Casualties: 800 Million 325 Million Deaths Middle East 150 Million US 120 Million Russia 60 Million China 30 Million Korea 120 Million: Other ",
