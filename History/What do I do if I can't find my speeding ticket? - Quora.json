            "answer_text": "If you know when your court date is and which court to go to; you don\u2019t have to do anything. Just show up for court. You don\u2019t need your copy. If you just want to pay the ticket off before court, call the court and speak to a clerk. Give the clerk your name. They\u2019ll look up your case and give you the information you need to mail-in the fine. If you can\u2019t remember your court date or which court to go to; call or show up in person at the police department that the officer works for. Ask for the records clerk. Tell him/her that you lost your copy of the speeding ticket. They\u2019ll make you a copy from the original. If you can\u2019t remember your court date or what police department issued the ticket; do a Google Maps search for police departments in the area you were when you received the ticket. Call the closest local police department in that area. Ask the dispatcher if their jurisdiction includes the area you were stopped. If so, it\u2019s likely that\u2019s the police department that the officer works for and you can get a copy of the ticket from the records clerk. If not, the dispatcher will know which police department patrols that jurisdiction and will give you their contact information. It\u2019s also possible that the local agency does patrol that area, but the ticket wasn\u2019t issued by that department. If this is the case the ticket was issued by a County Sheriff\u2019s Office or the State Police/Patrol. The dispatcher you speak to can give you contact information for both agencies. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few different avenues you can take on this.1. Contact the issuing agency. Our citations have an original and three copies. The original is filed with the court, first copy to the (alleged, for the lawyer types) violator, second copy for station file and the last stays in the book, typically retained by the officer. They *should* be able to make a copy for you. (Note: for a statewide agency, you should go to the local station, not try to get it from the main HQ) 2. Contact the court of competent jurisdiction (the court of the county where the citation was received. For example, if you received the ticket in Riverside County, don't try looking for the information with the San Luis Obispo County court. They will have absolutely NO idea what you're talking about). They will have the charging copied filed with them. 3. Depending on your local court, you may be able to find your citation information on the court's website. In my county, you can look up your citation on-line, using either the citation number (which you're probably not going to have, since you lost the ticket), your name and date of birth, or your driver license number. That will at least give you the information of the violation, and the date, time and location of your court appearance. ",
