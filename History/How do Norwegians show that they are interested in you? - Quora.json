            "answer_text": "Pretty much the same way people do in many other cultures; By flirting with you. By inviting you to do something together with them, particularly in a 1:1 setting. By giving you compliments. By giving you flowers. By outright telling you that they like you. By initiating intimacy of some sort with you, ranging from holding hands to sex. I don't think we differ all that much in this. But we probably do differ in the sense that many of us have a fair mix of both genders among our friends, and consider it to be pretty normal to do anything and everything with our friends regardless of their gender. In other words you can't assume a Norwegian has a crush on you solely because he/she acts in a friendly manner towards you.  I guess that too is true in many countries, but it's a matter of degree. If you're a woman, and the Norwegian you're wondering about is a man, you should probably consider that he may be doing less of the traditional male courting-things than you're used to; I'm 39 and I've never bought a woman a drink, nor have I ever asked a woman for a \"date\". The traditional script where the man is expected to initiate in a really obvious way while the woman is left to simply respond is less dominant here than some places. (I'm not claiming it's non-existant; it's true here too for example that in a bar men are more likely to approach women than the other way around) If they're not being very clear about it, and you want to know, you don't really have any better choice than to make a move of some sort yourself and see how they respond.
