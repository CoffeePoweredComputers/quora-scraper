            "answer_text": "Some US states share a border with Mexico because Mexico is to the south of the United States and has a northern border. The United States is to the north of Mexico and has s southern border. Where these two borders (north and south) meet the states there share borders with Mexico. Not all states are close enough to the southern border of the US to share a border with Mexico and those states share a border with Canada or have a border with other states. Sometimes I just shake my head and wonder at people. ",
