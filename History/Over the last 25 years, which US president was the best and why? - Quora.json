            "answer_text": "My vote is for Trump. In addition to all the tangible things he has done for which I upvoted Michael Gonzales somewhere in these answers, Trump has also brought more dynamism to Washington than I have ever witnessed in my lifetime. He questions everything that goes on in DC. He may not have cleared the swamp yet but has its denizens squirming. He is a maverick. He is not truly a Republican and far removed from being a democrat. He is like a heartless external consultant, the guy you bring in to challenge the status quo in your sputtering business. He has challenged the establishment and moved a lot of powerful people out of their comfort zones. He has resurrected a sense of patriotism that has been dormant for eight years and is moving us back to the Constitution and the principles of the Founders. The complacent press community has felt his ire and rightfully so. He has exposed it as not the objective, purveyor of the news it has perceived itself to be. In the process, the American public has learned to be warier of what it hears and reads, an excellent lesson in any school. Trump's management style and tactics rightfully draw criticism but are not an impeachable offense. They are juvenile too frequently. It may not be conventional to invent names for opponents, but they do amuse seniors and are spot on in terms of characterization of the subject. He is trying to improve in sharing recognition with others besides himself. Maybe someday he\u2019ll perhaps give 80% of the credit to others but I\u2019m not holding my breath. Politics is mainly a compromising process. When I look at what he\u2019s accomplished and what he\u2019s done wrong or poorly, my scales put the favorable balance in his court. Some people paint him as divisive. In fact, the division has been seething beneath the surface for many years before steaming out in the Obama years. Trump did not create it, he exposed it. There are still many rocks to look under before we see ourselves as a nation. Once we see the problem clearly, we can put together a plan to solve it. ",

            "answer_text": "25 years leaves Obama, he saved the economy from going over the cliff tried to disengage the USA from Christian crusades created by the GOP .All GOP presidents are racist it is their deplorable base of support. What completion does he have in 25 years? Clinton was acceptable his greatest fault was cooperating with the GOP undoing the safeguards set in place by FDR which is another reason the economy was going over the cliff. Let us look at W Bush installed as president by the fraud of 2000 by the NRA and Nazi Justice Rehnquist refusing to count the vote in Florida. W in his words wanted to be a glorious war time president like Roosevelt and Lincoln lied about weapons' of mass destruction to engage the US in a war that was lost before he could get weapons' of mass destruction out of his mouth, he fashioned it as a Christian crusade, attack a country that had nothing to do with 911 and lied about that too . My grandfather lived in Hoovers great depression before he died he watched Nixon on television and turned to me to say Herbert Hoover rest in peace Nixon is making you look good. W claimed you can\u2019t hang racism on me ,I say look at your response to the hurricane and the only reason you father was elected was the racist Willie Horton campaign ,that Lee Atwater the engineer apologized to Willie. W also bankrupt the world economy but that is just money he murdered a million innocent civilians forced two million refugees into Syria creating the civil war there, was 100% responsible for Bengasi that the GOP and Rush blamed on Hillary recently John Bolton claimed it was all his doing engineered it for W, W also rewrote the world map because of his Christian crusades and created the world of terrorism we live in today. So with respect to my grandfather W makes everyone look good except Trump who is uneducated criminal, treasonous and does a disservice to the people of this country. ",
