            "answer_text": "Stalin was impressed by FDR\u2019s commitment to dismantle the Empires (including, and especially, the British Empire) and open the world commerce to the benefit of American enterprise. Just as well, he saw certain elegance in the way FDR did it during WWII: destruction of Nazism was closely paralleled with surrender, by Britain, of its assets, control of sea lanes and trade rights. By the end of WWII, Britain was penniless, gasping for remnants of control over some corner here and there, and US was setting the rules of the world commerce for decades to come, and could afford to be lax on some non-strategic matter here or there. (It has to be noted: Stalin had a criminal record in bank robbery (money was used to support revolutionary causes), and is often to be referred to be one of the brains behind one of the classic robberies of the early XX century: 1907 Tiflis bank robbery - Wikipedia Some contemporary observers noted a morbid elegance, and a massive scale of this criminal undertaking.) There is a quote, attributed to Stalin, comparing his two counterparts, using a bit of a criminal\u2019s vocabulary (rough translation): \u201cChurchill is someone who will bend down to pick a pocket for a penny. Roosevelt? No, Roosevelt is not into picking pennies, heists he pulls are major jobs\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Stalin liked FDR. He didn't take to him immediately but he did not hate him at first sight the way he did Trotsky and Truman. The only time they met was in Tehran and Yalta. In Tehran FDR agreed to stay at the Soviet embassy where he almost certainly was being eavesdropped upon. Perhaps this made Stalin feel he wasn't a threat or could even be trusted. At a formal dinner at Yalta Stalin said after the war was won 90,000 Nazi leaders would be executed. Churchill flipped out over the ethics of this but FDR agreed because he considered it idle talk. Stalin liked FDR's reaction to this. At Yalta everyone saw FDR's health had greatly deteriorated since Tehran. Looking at FDR dozing in a wheelchair from a distance, Stalin felt pity for him and wondered aloud to an aide why God had dealt FDR the fate He had. FDR kept his opinions about Stalin to himself. Perhaps the Cold War would have gone differently had FDR lived. ",
