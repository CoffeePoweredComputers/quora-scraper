            "answer_text": "Quicklime Also known as calcium oxide, quicklime is made from heating limestone in a kiln. When ground into a powder it could be very effective, especially in naval warfare. The 13th century writer Giles of Rome explains: \u201cthere used to be a large number of pots filled with ground quicklime, which are to be thrown from aloft into the enemies\u2019 ships. When the pots are thrown with force and shatter on impact, the powder rises in the air (as has been noted above in reference to land war) and enters the enemies\u2019 eyes and irritates them so greatly that, nearly blinded, they cannot see. This situation is very dangerous in naval warfare because fighting men in such war see themselves threatened with death from every quarter. Wherefore, if the eyes of the fighting men in such a battle are so irritated by powdered lime that they cannot see, they can easily either be slain by their enemies or submerged in the water.\u201d  Urumi  Essentially the Urumi was a cross between a whip and a sword. It was made out of highly flexible metal with sharpened edges, allowing it to be wrapped around the arm or waist when not in use. Because of its unique shape, it proved to be a highly effective weapon as it could bend around protective shields and was almost impossible to parry with traditional swords. However, it took years of dedicated training to use and injuries for the user were frequent and painful. Harmonica guns, multi-shot weapons with a horizontal magazine, invented by J. Jarre between 1859 and 1862   A Dyson LePetit protector ring, a six shot .22 pistol   Kiss of Death, a 4.5mm caliber lipstick pistol used by KGB during the Cold War  Krummlauf  Photo: Pinterest German for \"curved barrel,\" this was an attachment to the Stug 44 assault rifle that would allow the user to shoot around corners without exposing himself to enemy fire. The Krummlauf was issued to tank crews for defending their vehicles against infantry, but rarely used and quickly withdrawn because of numerous design problems. Some of these included short barrel lifespans and bullets shattering as they came around the curves of the device. There were also multiple cases of friendly fire casualties among German troops who couldn't see what they were shooting at. Antonov A-40 Flying Tank  Photo: Pinterest Essentially a light tank with glider wings attached to it, the A-40 was designed by the Soviet Union to be airlifted in support of airborne or partisan operations. One prototype was built, but the design was impossible to tow by aircraft of the day, and there was no assurance that the tank and the crew would land together. The project was scrapped. Ushakov's Flying Submarine  Photo: Pinterest Another unorthodox Soviet tank design, this was the brainchild of engineer Boris Ushakov, who developed a blueprint for a three-engined aircraft that would seal its outer hull with metal plates and dive, so it could fire its two torpedoes. The project was suspended in 1939, restarted in 1943 and built its first prototype in 1947. But by then, the war was over and Soviet military research was directed elsewhere. The flying submarine never actually flew. Corkscrew Tank  Photo: Pinterest One more entry into the \"absurd Russian tank designs\" category is the corkscrew tank. Designed to meet the challenges posed by harsh, rugged, and snowy Russian terrain, the corkscrew tank would have been propelled forward or sideways not by wheels, but by giant corkscrews on either side. The tank ended up being used as part of Russia's cold war arsenal, though only in cold weather areas, as it was slow and prone to tipping over otherwise. Corkscrew designs have been used since then to propel arctic vehicles. The Aircraft Carrier Made of Ice  Photo: Imgur With the Allies desperate for ways to protect their merchant convoys from German submarines, the British thought way outside the box for what became known as \"Project Habbakuk.\" Allied science adviser Geoffrey Pike developed the idea of constructing ships made of icebergs: They could be up to 4,000 feet long, 600 feet wide and 130 feet in depth, and practically impossible to sink of the ice was dense enough.Two American professors then discovered that adding a small amount of wood pulp to water before freezing made it virtually indestructible, and they named this new material \"Pykrette\" after Pyke. While several testbeds of Pykrette were constructed on lakes in Canada, wartime manufacturing soon caught up to the needs of the Allied navies, and the ice aircraft carrier was abandoned.
