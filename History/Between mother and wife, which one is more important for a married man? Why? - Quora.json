            "answer_text": "Which one is more important for a married man? Definitely if his mother is mature, she will tell him to love his wife. She will also love his wife. If his mother and his wife quarrel and the man has to go for his wife. That is because that way his mother is immature. That is because his mother is one of the persons who had shaped his character. And when the man was very young and was in his tender age, he would have believed in so much his mother had told and he would have seen as a towering figure in his life. And so later whatever way he behaves, his mother is responsible. It is an insult on a man to expect a man give importance to one of the persons among his mother or wife. Definitely the mother is in a better position to blackmail him citing all the sacrifices she had done for him. And the worst part is if the man is immature, he will be more trusting his mother if she blames his wife and won\u2019t be kind to his wife. That is because the child part of him is familiar with his mother\u2019s ways but not his wife\u2019s ways. Whatever his mother needs, his mother definitely can\u2019t expect emotional support from him and she can\u2019t show as a child to him. But his wife needs to be emotionally supported by him and that way only his relationship with his wife blooms. His duty is to build understanding and trust with his wife. And definitely it is not necessary for him to build understanding and trust with his mother. What will really happen is the man will give more importance to the more mature woman among these two. But the truth is, if the mother were mature, he will also be a mature person and will take care of his wife. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is it a matter of comparison when it comes to mother and wife? There are several other relationships that matter in a guy\u2019s life. There are hardly considered when it comes to measuring his feelings towards them vis-a-vis anyone else. Strange, right? Having said that, women themselves perpetuate this thinking by trying to pull the guy (son/husband) towards them and seeking a bigger part of him. As if he is a possession to be owned. Every relationship has its own place in one\u2019s life. A mother gives life to her son, nurtures him and wishes nothing but the best for him. Her presence and importance can never be measured or diminished. A wife leaves her home and comes to live with her husband, placing all her trust and hopes in him. She leaves behind life as she knows it to embrace life as they envisage together. The husband is her support system in her new environment and she is willing to forge new bonds and reinvent herself to be his partner and companion in the journey of life. She wishes nothing but the best for her husband\u2026 her love. The guy sees the love, sacrifices, pains and efforts of his mother as he grows up from a baby to a responsible individual. He keeps reiterating to himself about how he will take care of her when he is capable of doing so. He sees the vulnerabilities of his wife who invests her emotions and hopes in him and seeks to reassure her with his love and support. While the former is a relation he venerates, the latter is the one he seeks to cultivate. Both are beyond comparison as they don\u2019t follow the same trajectory. They have their own space and importance in a guy\u2019s life and intersect only when it comes to loving their common denominator\u2026 the guy. The entry of one cannot usurp the space of another. Rather, it should not. The issue crops up when one or both are insecure about their own self and seek to reaffirm their presence by undermining the other one\u2019s presence. This leads to a tug of war with the guy being the ultimate prize. But in actuality, the guy pays the ultimate price by getting divided into two halves and never being able to savour life with the two people who can actually make him happy by being together. No matter how much he tries, he cannot decide who is more important as they both matter to him. Compartmentalising isn\u2019t a easy job particularly when it comes to matters of emotions and feelings. If the women in question deal with each other in a mature manner, the question of comparison will never arise. Both fill in shoes that cannot be filled by the other. They both are loved and significant, just not by the same yardstick. Above all, their relationship with the guy doesn\u2019t need to be compared to be reminded of it\u2019s value. They both love the guy. That\u2019s a wonderful commonality that can make them coexist and bond without seeking to divvy the man. He shouldn\u2019t have to prove himself again and again. ",

            "answer_text": "The state of the Married Man becomes complicated when the couple stay with the Parents. I have seen this happen for both my Dad and my husband. They get pissed off and always become a sandwich between Mom and Wife. I am a wife as well as a daughter. But when I saw the situation as a daughter, I always felt my Mom was wrong and my grandma should have a take too. However, now as a wife I realise that the generation gap is making things more complicated. There are a lot of many things that the older generation is not able to understand and accept in this highly sensitive Tech Age. Now I feel, this might have happened with my Mom too. For any human (male or female) parents should come first according to me. However, the wife has also sacrificed so much to fit into your family, adapt your culture, food, and left behind all her comforts for the sake of being with you. If the man feels that his mom has done this too and has put in her best efforts to nurture him, then he should also realize that his wife is nurturing his kid. And this is a cycle. And it also depends on the man and his attitude for being a good son as well as a good husband. There are a lot of divorce cases in Asia which has happened due to the parents interference. However, the older generation should be able to accept the fact that they have lived their life, nurtured their kids, grew them up and now its their turn to take a backseat and enjoy the view. This would make the couple more responsible for getting settled on their own, raising the kids, and the cycle should continue. Every decade is bringing new changes. And the one who is able to survive is the one who can adapt to those changes. One should not have an attitude like \"hey, I am older to you so I know things better. Dont teach me!\". This worsens the situation. And the misunderstandings continue and never end. As they say, \"Your age doesn't define your maturity, your behavior does!\" ",

            "answer_text": "Which eye is important for you? Left or right!. In a person\u2019s life both the women are important. Mother:\u2014 Loves you and support you conditionally.Never takes revenge, even though if you illtreat her.Don't love you based on your economic conditions.Be with you in all difficult times.Wife:\u2014 Even though you are not her blood relative, sacrifices her life for you.Even though married you based on your economic conditions, serve you and take care of you until last breath.She needs more love from you, bcuz she has left her family and she cannot approach her family if she faces problem.Even if she feels, her parents are more important: then you cannot have a life partner.After marriage, its your wife who shares your feelings, sorrows and difficulties with you. Even though your mother loves you unconditionally, you cannot share your feelings with mother. Mother loves you because \u201cBlood is thicker than water\u201d. Wife loves you and support you even without blood bonding. A newly wedded wife needs her husband's support, because she is wedded to him. You have to take side whoever is right. Your family may find her wrongs because they feel her as a outsider. Your mother may be good to you and love you. But she may hate your wife and torture her. Moreover, you need to spend rest of your life with wife. If you fall ill, its your wife who will look after you(mother may be aged and unable to look after as her health condition will not be good). Now you decide, as a married man whom do you approach for your needs? Whom do you want to share your responsibilities? Whom do you want to cook for you and look after thouse the household works. Don't you expect your wife to support you ahead of her parents? Ask your mother whom does she want her husband to select between her and her Mil. You will get the answer. Don't scold both of them in front of each other. Assure them that you love and support both of them. Mother is like a education or student life. Wife is like a job or professional life. You need education to fetch a job. Both are equally important. During childhood and upto a certain age education is more important and your student life is quite liberal and happy. But professional life expects you to be more perfect and matured. Because in student life your decisions may not affect others, whereas in job your wrongs will cost you more. You cannot be student all the time. In the age of earning you cannot keep on studying. You have to choose job for livelihood and so on. Hence both are important at particular stage. Anyway please be good son as well as husband. Don't hesitate to spend for your mother in old age. Same time give importance to your wife too. Don't abuse or neglect either of them to appease other one. You have to assure your wife that you stand by her in her difficulties. Don't treat her as a outsider. Moreover don't believe anyone's words too blindly. ",

            "answer_text": "Well by all means your parents I.e father and mother both than comes your wife and then comes your children because if your parents would not have been there then you would not have been there and then comes your wife. It is most important to pay your debt first and then spend for future investment I.e your wife and children. They are your future investment which may or may not repay. You can only found out that after say 5- 15 years as the case may be. But your parents are the one who have toiled hard and enriched you with their sweat and blood. They are the one because of which you are what you are today & if they cannot be on the top of your priority list than nobody else can not even GOD himself/ herself. You all can say that I am very backwards in my thought. You may be right also. But if you are not putting your parents at top of your priority list even before your wife and children even though it is causing you a lot of hardships than you can never be a worthy son and are a spineless creature to say the least and if your wife expects herself to be put ahead in priority vis-\u00e0-vis your parents than I can only say this that you are most unfortunate to say the least. The same implies for your wife and her parents vis-\u00e0-vis you yourself per say. If the above thoughts are not seconded by your wife it is better not to marry at all in first place else you as a son and husband will always suffer at hands of your wife and mother because of their infighting. Those who say wife is the one who is the most venerable part in this whole gambit of marriage are totally wrong it is you as a son/ husband who is the most venerable of the whole conundrum called marriage because he will suffer no matter what either from wife's accusations or her mother's. So compatibility between wife and mother is more important than husband and wife when it comes to family and by family I doesn't mean husband and wife I mean husband wife and their parents. I may be old fashioned to say the least but if a family is to rise it is only this way please. ",

            "answer_text": "Well..one lady has played a very important role in your past and another lady is going to play a very important role in the future. Also, we always tend to look forward and our consciousness flows forward.For instance, when your kids are born, your complete focus shifts on them.You automatically give them more importance than your parents.And it was the same for our parents when we were born. They gave us more attention than their parents.And the same thing happens with you. The question of who is important is very tricky. It arises only when either the mother or wife or both try to show their dominion on the son/ husband. And then conflict arises. A lady leaves her family and comes to her husband's place so she is important. She needs to be given that importance. A mother definitely deserves all respect and importance but she would be possessive for her son if she has had an unsatisfied married life. She has not got that importance from her husband and she tries to fill that void/ shallowness by getting attention from her son, this happens especially in India. I have seen this cycle going on and on. And thereby more dissatisfied women are there in society. And this actually defeats the complete purpose of marriage. A man is born to be united with his wife and not his mother. Therefore, considering the institution of marriage, a wife is more important not because of anything else but for the reason that she is going to be your soulmate and the person,who would share her everything with you. Your mother's soulmate is your father not you. Add to this, this tug of war enters the bedroom too and disturbs the sexual lives of the couple. I would rather suggest that men give importance to thier wives and thereby create a society, which is full of happy, energetic, blooming, women. Thanks ",

Mother is important too\u2026 you take care of her, you continue loving her, you give all the respect she requires, you make her laugh, spend time with her, go out with her to the places she likes\u2026but don't ignore your wife, you give some decisions to your mother to make, you give some decisions to your wife to make\u2026a mother should understand that her son now needs to live rest of his life with his wife\u2026she should also respect their new relation, their privacy, and their decision. She should sometimes arrange dinners for the couple, ask them to go for a movie, dinners etc just like the daughter in law cooks food for his family, visit his relatives, participates in all the family traditions - touch thier feet, listen to them, respect them. I understand that a mother might have sacrificed a lot but I think almost all the women do that for their kids..and infact this new woman in thier family might do the same for her kids\u2026it is a cycle\u2026love needs to be bloom between the couple, every person around them should help them make this happen ",

The main focus for a married man should be to gauge who is right and who is wrong and how well can he convince the wrong person that they where wrong without hurting their feelings if you can master it early in life once you are married the better if not your life turns an emotional cesspool very hard very fast.

Hopefully, as many have said, a mother (and any other parents) have raised their kids to be decent people who are capable of functioning in the world on their own. When you get married, you are promising to be with someone else. You\u2019re starting your own family even if it\u2019s just the two of you. Legally, that changes things, such as spouses becoming the default next of kin. Things will be different emotionally, too; you love your spouse differently than you love your parents. I think it\u2019s important to love and support one\u2019s parent(s), but when you\u2019re married, your priorities do change. Hopefully there\u2019s a way to balance them, because being put in a place where you\u2019d have to decide between a wife and mother (or husband and father or whatever combination) is horrible. All that said, I do think that barring extenuating circumstances, the spouse is a higher priority. ",

            "answer_text": "The wife is considerably more important. The wife is the person you\u2019ll be spending your life with, celebrating triumphs, surviving losses. She\u2019s the person who will bear your children and probably take the lion\u2019s share in raising them. She\u2019s the person who will support you in all of your endeavors. The two of you will sink or swim together. Your mother played a key role in your life, helping you to become an adult, protecting you when you were a child, guiding your moral and intellectual development and she deserves your love and consideration. But her role is largely in your past. Her job, so far as it concerns you, is pretty much done. If circumstances force you to decide between the two of them, it seems to me that the right choice is obvious. Do what you can to honor your mother. But devote yourself body and soul to your wife. ",

            "answer_text": "One gives birth, the other gives life. In Indian families this problem arises the most and how women are treated is to be blamed. Girls before marriage are not given much importance by their parents as they marry and belong to another family. This kind of partial treatment will make her set expectations of love and importance from her husband and husbands family. When such girls are not welcomed properly in husband\u2019s family problem arises as they become more insecure.On the other hand many wives do not get required care and attention from their husbands which makes them set expectations from their son. ( Son is mine and he will treat me better than his father).Above are the two major factors which make a woman more possessive towards his son or husband. Well there are other factors too. Priority should be given to wife as you start a new life with her and she will be your companion for the rest of your life. She will be mother of your child. Also the one who takes care of you in your old age. It\u2019s important that you love and keep her happy to lead a harmonious life. If wife is not happy it will reflect in your kids too.Every child wants to see their mother happy. Priority should also be given to mother as well but not as much as wife, parents stand a circle outer after marriage . Parents health and well being should always be taken care. Problem arises when a mother takes control of everything of a married son. Such interferences will make wife feel she is secondary and is not important.Such things should be communicated gently.But most of the mother\u2019s do not comprehend it properly and create more problems as they think son has changed after marriage. If the intervention is too much that you cannot concentrate on your life then the only option is to stay separate. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No. It depends on the situation. On the one hand, generally speaking, no one loves you the way your mother does. Divorces are sadly all too common these days and eventually exes move on and form new relationships. On the other hand, for example, if your mother and wife clash - and each separately tries to give you a version of her story, insist the other be present otherwise you won\u2019t hear her out! I\u2019ll give you two examples My ex-mother-in-law wanted her son to marry a wealthy woman - which I am not, hence her dislike of me. She told my ex-brother-in-law that whilst standing on the ladder hanging a curtain, I pulled her off and she tumbled to the floor. When he confronted me, I brought the ladder inside and politely asked her to climb it. She\u2019s very short, only 4 feet and suffers from severe arthritis, meaning she can\u2019t lift a leg to climb the first step! I turned to my BIL and quietly said, \u201cNever mind she can\u2019t climb the ladder, given her age (76 yo) she\u2019d have broken bones and/or bruises. If you still don\u2019t believe me, please call the police, they\u2019ll sort out this mess,\u201d You could hear a pin drop. He didn\u2019t utter a word and left soon after. After he left, she turned to me and said, \u201cI said no such thing\u201d. (!!!) She apparently tried this trick with my ex, but he didn\u2019t believe her! One woman I know dislikes her MIL so much that she\u2019s forbidden her to cuddle her grandkids. The MIL hasn\u2019t told her son for fear of reprisals and only cuddles them in secret. In a nutshell, use your best judgement, every situation is different. ",

She employed all her essence to keep and protect you. She did not care if she herself went hungry, while you were fed to satiety; or to go thirsty herself, while your thirst was quenched; or to have no clothes, while you were well-covered; or to stay in the hot sun, while you were sheltered; She ignored her sweet sleep and tolerated the pain of sleeplessness for your sake. She protected you against the heat of summer and cold of winter. She bore all that pain in order to have you, and you may have her. You should know that you are unable to thank your mother appropriately unless God helps you and grants you the favour and ability to repay her.Mother\u2019s order is respected even in comparison with God's command, is when an obligatory divine order comes across a mother's prohibition, on the condition that the action concerned does not fall within the imperative and obligatory injunctions such as daily prayer, or the fast of the month of Ramadhan.We have order to respect mother even after her DeathThe Fifth Imam says: \"An offspring may be benevolent to his parents during their life\u00ad time, but he may not repay his debt to them after they die, nor pray for their salvation, and forget them altogether. In such a case, this offspring will be included by God in the category of those who misbehave towards their parentsOn the other hand, husband has some duties toward his wifeA man, who is supporting his family, should know that a woman is also a human being like a man. She also has desires and the rights of freedom and life.

You\u2019ll get yourself in further trouble. Women don\u2019t forget!! They\u2019ll remember this that you chose the other one over them. And, you\u2019ll suffer the consequences later in form of taunts or behavioral changes. If there\u2019s a problem going on between the women in your life. The best you can do is to take a step back, and let them resolve the issue. Try to exclude yourself from such question. Or simply say \u201cboth of you are important/dear to me. I can\u2019t choose one over the another\u201d. Upon insisting, just walk away, or show a sign of exhaustion, and tell them how disappointed you\u2019re with the question. Don\u2019t put yourself in a position where you can\u2019t get out of easily! You need to just remember that a woman gave birth to you, fed you, taught you, and gave you the happiness who you call mother. And, the woman you share your problems with, wants to grow old with, have kids with, wants to make team with, and call her yours is the one you call wife. Everyone has their place in men\u2019s heart. But, being just is what it takes to be a man. Good luck! ",

My wife introduced herself with her full name (including my name) with all pride and smile in her eyes. So did my mother introduced her name with my fathers name with smile and pride. Wife has left her home name sometimes even career to be with you. Appreciate that. I know at times in todays age, when divorce rates are so high this concept would be hard to believe.

The bible tells you to leave your parents and cleave to the wife when you get married. I would choose the wife over the mom, because you are supposed to spend your life with your wife by your side, and not your mom by your side. figure out if you want to stay married, or not and work along those lines. You should respect your mom because you only get one of those. but if you want a relationship with your wife to continue then you need to make sure that you are not always taking your mother\u2019s side. remember : you chose to marry your wife. which means to me at least that you love her and respect her and want to spend the rest of your life with her. you can\u2019t do that if she feels that she is the other woman and your mom is the woman that you are with.< yes I said that correctly ",

I am not saying your wife is angel but she is an outsider who has solely came believing you, and what ever her behaviour is based on the stimuli. ( It\u2019s a reaction to your mother action) At the moment, all you need is to make a safe distance so that situation can be diffused and you can understand your wife and mother expectation and try to make them come to term. I am asking to choose wife over mother is because moms are often very much possessive for their boy and as they get married n their priority changes at sub conscious level they get threatened and jealous.. it\u2019s human nature. And some distance at the moment will help her rethink to consider bridging gap\u2026 and your wife will listen to you because you choosed her and she is assured you will always be for her. I apologies if I hurt your sentiment. ",

            "answer_text": "The word love belongs to mothers first. How come a balanced man can keep any one above his mother. A son places himself one with his mother and expects her to be pro son. A wife has no direct biological relationship with her husband though some marry their sisters\u2019 or cousins\u2019 daughters .Love is a phenomenal word it exists only when a quality relationship is maintained.Love with wife does not qualify as divine. It is mostly convenient oriented or developed from forced dependency like children becoming a common thread to stay together. Mother -son relationship is natural and deeper than wife\u2019s relationship. A wife can be replaced not a mother.I am not making a biased or pro mother assessment here. It is unfair to compare as mothers will be departing at one stage and wives may live with their husbands longer . Love has more meaning to it. Each and every human being if matured will love mothers beyond horizons. Husbands are committed to accept wives and develop love with them whereas mothers share the same genes. ",

            "answer_text": "Today, many married men are caught in this situation due to constant bickering between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law. A very delicate issue but must be attended to intelligently by all concerned. Men and their family members must first realize that a girl is leaving her comfort zone (parent\u2019s place) and settling down in a new family. So, it becomes essential that she is given sufficient time to get to know the practices and adjust. All the family members must show her affection, kindness, understanding and never be critical about her or her family members. Mother has nurtured her son and knows about him completely. Intelligent MIL will give ample privacy to the couples, never interfere nor impose her views rigidly. DIL must learn to respect elders even if she disagrees with them, develop a positive attitude, be cheerful and assert herself without offending. This is a great relationship management exercise and all can gain great experience if they can manage the relations and live happily despite the differences amongst them. Wife is definitely important part of man\u2019s life and loving Mother knows this and will never want her loving son to suffer. Despite best efforts if joint family living becomes impossible, nothing wrong to set up a separate home for the young couple. However, hatred must not be developed and keep the contacts alive by frequent meetings according to convenience. ",

Never give up your mom. Cause, how much your mom loves you, may be your wife will love your son the same. Not you. ",

So whenever you are with your mother make her feel the special lady in your life and when you are with your wife make her feel the special lady in your life. But when it comes to choice never choose no matter how bad the situation gets you should never choose one because you would never be able to do justice to any one of them. Your mother and your wife both have made bigger sacrifices for you than you have made for either one of them. Your wife left her mother for you which you can't right now and your mother well there is no need to explain this. So, try not to choose but when there is no other option then assess the situation look who is at fault. If both are right in their own way then you should lean towards your mother because a mother's love is greater than that of a spouse. I hope it helped. May Allah guide you. ",

When I began developing a relationship with the father, through the son, and led by the spirit\u2026.I was afraid putting God first would hurt my marriage. I came to learn quickly that loving Him first allowed me to love my husband even better. My love towards him became more pure and healthier. If that makes sense. So with that I don\u2019t feel like we should look at a relationship with our spouse being more important than our relationship with our parent or vise versa. All relationships we have are equally important in my view. They are all different, but all very important just the same. ",

You respect and honor their kindness, work and sacrifice. But you are an adult now, that part of your life is ended. Your life is your own now. Your highest priority is your family, not your parents family. Your wife is your partner, your companion and your highest advisor. She should be an integral part of your life. She is the present and the future, your mother is the past. You have connections with your family, as does she. Respect those connections, and ask them to respect the bittersweet truth that their work is done. ",

You can't in this life pay parents debts at any cost. Only you & wife has to mould in your behavior rather changing her. Only sujestion you can give to your mother & not order regarding what is right & what is wrong with considerable moral values. ",

This is why the Bible says that a man and a woman shall leave their parents and cling to each other. It does not mean you won't ever see your parents again but that you are now making your own relationship and home. Equally a woman who is putting her parents before her husband - whether it be either socialising or confiding - damages her marriage. Some mother-in-laws have a difficult time with this concept. The husband must tell his own mother that his wife comes first. Same for the wife. ",

And that the TWO become ONE FLESH. That is as intimate and clear as possible. By FAR, all husbands first priority, after God, is TO THEIR WIFE. ",

Ask this question other way around instead, Between her mother and husband, which one is more important for a married women? If you think her mother is more important than her husband , then your mother is important than wife. If you think her husband is more important than her mother , then your wife is important than mother. Mother and wife, both are different phases of life for a man. A man has to love and protect his wife no matter she is right or wrong. A man has to see that his mother is not disrespected by any one, not even wife. ",

There should be no priority because both are important in your life then why are you asking that who should be more important. What if I ask you that who is more important in your parents, your father or your mother? I am sure that 90% people will say that , \u201c Both are important for me\u201d. Then why you are asking such kind of questions. Giving more priority to one means you are easily neglecting other person and as well as she is not as much as important in your life. So stop giving priority to someone. If your mother and wife both are important then there should be balance between both and no priority should be given to anyone. If you think that someone is more important than other then it means other person is an option for you. ",

A mother is the one woman who has carried you for 10 months breaking several bones for you, staying hungry and so many sacrifices that you are in such a position. A wife is someone who has come with you with the trust you wouldn\u2019t let her down. Left her entire family to make your family as hers. There is no choice here. You should be a capable man of defending both and make them comfortable with each other that you wouldn\u2019t be in a tight spot as to whom you need to choose. ",

He loves both - his wife and mother equally, just that the love he has for both the women is radically different. His mother is there with him since birth, so naturally he will love her no matter what - that's human nature. And his wife is his partner and someone who will be with him (in most cases), even after his parents leave him. There is no comparison between the love of a man for his wife and mother. You should never ask your man this question under any circumstances - just be happy for the love you're receiving\u2026 :) ",

The woman who loves you more than anybody else, no matter what you do or what you become. The woman who gives and gives to you, never expecting much in return, other than your love. When she grows old and feeble, she will need your care, just as she cared for you when you were a baby and feeble. Will you abandon her to an Old Folks Home instead? As for your wife, well, she might leave you for reasons that your mother would never leave you. Divorce rates are high all over the world. ",

There are so many expectations of inlaws from a girl that this whole thing turns into a fight. Now, the son is in a dilemma who to support, and then who is more important to you question arises. I feel that mother and wife should be friends first, their relationship should not be like a competitor. Here, a son can play an important role and how he handles the situation. This is my personal opinion. ",

She won't nurture you like a baby, but will create your family and help nurture it. Have you ever compared between sister and mother or brother and father? They have different place and they don't seem to fight about it. Patriarchy gave women just one option to access power- lady of the house. Apparently, most Indian households have this mom vs wife thing because of this. And they look upto the man of the house, the leader, to choose his favorite who can rule. We dont need that in modern world because women have more options and ambitions. Even if they ask you to intervene, don't (unless either is straight up abusive). They're adults capable of handling the fight without supervision of a man. For that man, both are family, with different roles. ",

But, it will have little effect because in your heart you know this already. But you just do not realise it. So, let me tell you this instead. This is a highly immature question. Though it is a very popular narrative in most Indian households. Trying to compare and put hierarchial bands to your own family members is the beginning of disorienting manipulation. Why do you want to pit your wife and mother against each other, unless you want both of them to be fighting for your attention? Grow up and get a life. And please, do something for your self esteem first. ",
