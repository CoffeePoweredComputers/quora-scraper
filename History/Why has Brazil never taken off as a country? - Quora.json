            "answer_text": "I\u2019m an 43 years old engineer who was born in Brazil and had lived here all my life. Here is my answer to your question: Brazil hasn't taken off because: The quality of education is terribly bad. 80% of Brazilians fail in literacy tests on their native language (portuguease) . They fail in basic maths also. Their ignorance in subjects of basic Schooling is bluntant.Many civil public servers are corrupt. If you are willing to bring your business to Brazil you defenetly would think twice. If you are resolute then you defenetly shall have money to pay bribes for public workers and politicians.Brazil is uterrely violent. The murder rate here is rampant. The state of Rio de Janeiro is in civil war. The population is dying victims of violent crimes carried by bandids who set an parallel state to impose their authority over the population.The majority of politicians are scoundrels and many are even criminals. They organize themselves in mafia like organizations disguised as political parties . Many federal representatives (500 deputies and 80 senators) are being investigated for crimes like corruption, murder , drug dealing , slavery.There is an social abssys, where 10% of population retains 90% of GDP and lives like kinks and queens in closed in castle with walls 10 ft tall. The other 90% of population share the remaining 10% of GDP and live in violent neighborhoods.Brazil still has workers working under the yoke of slavery (yes, they have an master , they don't are payd for their work, they can't live their work , they receive physical punishment).Justice treats the upper and lower classes differently. Upper class VIPs receives special treatment when brought to court and almost always are acquinted of their crimes. Lower class criminals are almost always sent to prisons which presents precarious conditions were they turn even worse. Many are kept in prison for many years without reciving proper judgment. It's comun to have innocents under arrest for years without judgment until its innocence be proven and they are finelly released. Many times women were jailed in the same place as men an got raped.The workers, of all levels, lack proper education and proper training. Their productivity is very low when compared to other underdevelopment countries.Lack of sanitation. This is an unpleasant side of Brazil and makes it litteraly an shithole.Lack of concern by enmviremont. The Amazon rainforest is being destroyed to be used for cattle pasture. Some predict that in 50 years we wont have it anymore.",

            "answer_text": " I would not say Brazil has never taken off as a country. I would say there is opportunity for improvement. Corruption is a scourge on the Brazilian economy, the extent of the damage it causes is difficult to ascertain. The country is starved for investment in education, healthcare and infrastructure. The path to improving Brazilian economic performance clearly involves ending corruption and increasing investment in these much needed areas. There is something else though that most people are not aware of, but that they should be. This is that Brazil faces significant natural obstacles related to geography and inflation. This is the conclusion reached in a fascinating article on the development challenges facing Brazil. The article was published in 2012 on the Stratfor website. Inflation is Brazil\u2019s biggest problem. Economic growth is inflationary anywhere in the world. But in Brazil the scarcity of land, labor, transport infrastructure and capital mean that any economic growth almost instantly turns inflationary. Brazil has a serious case of inflation-phobia, as would any country with its history. In fact, the country\u2019s recent macroeconomic policy could be described as seeking low inflation at any cost, rather than growth at any cost. Much of Brazil is tropical. Tropical zones represent the most difficult sort of biome for human activity. Soils are poor, diseases are rampant. Central Brazil lacks navigable rivers. Moving goods on water costs about 10 to 30 times less than moving the same goods on trucks. Only 7% of Brazilian territory is considered traditionally arable. The vast Cerrado region can be farmed, but only at great cost. While 85% of US farms are 500 acres or less, 70% of Brazilian farms are 500 acres or more. The Brazilian interior is a raised plateau called the Brazilian Shield. The drop-off from the shield to the Atlantic ocean is quite steep; most of the coast appears as a wall when viewed from the ocean. Cities are found on small, isolated pockets of relatively flat land where the plateau falls to the sea. The dirth of flat land means that, with the exception of Sao Paulo, cities cannot radiate out as they\u2019ve done in the US and Europe, leveraging economies of scale. Brazil has few major highways and railways and lacks a major coastal road system. The seven largest Brazilian ports combined have less loading capacity than the top U.S. port, New Orleans. Of course, inflation and geography don\u2019t explain the way in which crime, of many kinds, has traditionally largely gone unpunished in Brazil. Criminal behavior sometimes appears to be a credential for office holders\u2026\u201dI steal, but I deliver!\u201d In considering Brazil\u2019s accomplishments and shortcomings, who are we to benchmark the country against? What if we compare Brazil to its peers in the southern hemisphere? From that perspective the world looks different: included are the countries of South America and Africa that fall below the equator, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. From that perspective of a world of about 43 country-sized countries, Brazil comes in a respectable #10 in GDP per capita, as ranked by the IMF in 2015. ",
