The Canarias didn\u2019t offer any incentive for the Moroccans for conquest: not the Idrisids, or Almohads, or Marinids\u2026 just a few pagan tribes and nothing more. As things happened, the conquest of the Canarias was initially a private enterprise by two Norman entrepreneurs, Jean de Bethencourt and Gadifer de la Salle. They travelled there because they found an economic incentive to do just that, orchilla (Roccella canariensis), a lichen used for dyeing textiles, the industry both men had investments. They found investors in Castilla, and eventually sold their interests to the Count of Niebla, who sold them to three Andaluzan families: Casas, Pedraza and Garc\u00eda de Herrera. Based on these holding the Crown of Castilla claimed the islands at the time of the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas-Toledo (1479). ",

            "answer_text": "Hard to say, except Morocco never claimed the islands to this day, despite them being no more than 100 miles from their coast. Yet truly Morocco has no sensible grounds to claim these islands. They have never been under their control. Maybe because the land was originally inhabited by the Guanches, a group technically related to Berbers, but a separate political entity from the Arab Berbers of the mainland, as they lived in relative isolation until the Spanish settled. Morocco does have a few points of contention with Spain over territorial waters, between its shores and the Canaries, and mainly because of fishing and oil drilling rights. It rejected Spain's unilateral designation of a median line from the islands in 2002. It seems Spain is not just trying to steal Portuguese territorial waters off the \u2018Selvagens Archipelago\u2019 of Madeira, but trying to do the same with Morocco\u2019s too. ",
