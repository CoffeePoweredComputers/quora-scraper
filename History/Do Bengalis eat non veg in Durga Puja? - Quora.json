            "answer_text": "If you perform Durga Puja, it is imperative that you avoid non vegetarian food during that time. The Bengalis who consume non vegetarian food during Durga Puja do not actually perform any rituals. At the most, they will partake in \u201cPushpanjali\u201d. Durga Puja requires you to be in fast during the rituals. My family is heavily involved in the rituals, thus my mother maintains fast for the entirety of the festival. During Durga Puja, we eat pure vegetarian food prepared without onion or garlic. We have our first bite of non vegetarian food at the end of Navami. I have been mocked by my fellow Bengalis many times for not having that chicken roll or fish cutlet during Durga Puja. I implore my fellow Bengalis to not comment on how liberal they are in the comments section, because my experiences show otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "First, Bengalis do not celebrate the Navaratri like the Northern, Central and Western part of India. We celebrate the same period in a different way. The \u2018Amabasya\u2019 is celebrated as Mahalaya, which is has two significance. One is you offer \u2018Tarpan\u2019 for your forefathers in the river Ganga. Second is the \u2018Abahan\u2019 or \u2018Prayer to call\u2019 maa Durga. The next 5 days are not important for us. Day 6 is \u2018Shashthi\u2019 when the Durga Puja starts with \u2018Pran-Patishtha\u2019 of the idol. Day 7 - Saptami, Day 8 - Ashtami, Day 9 - Nabami. The 10th day, when the Navaratri celebration culminates in Dushhara or Dussera, we bid goodbye to our maa Durga with a heavy heart in Dashami (Day 10). The next \u2018Purnima\u2019 is the Lakshmi Puja for us. Coming to the second point. Unlike Northern, Central, Southern and Western part of India, non-veg, especially fish, is considered auspicious or \u2018Shubha\u2019 for us. During certain Pujas, marriages, etc, gifting a fish is mandatory. So, eating fish, and an extension other non-veg, is not an offence for us. We rather worship any form of food, the non-veg type a little more. ",

Now, In Village area People during Durga Puja generally have veg food specially in Brahmin Family like in our home but it is not strictly followed by the young people like my parents and the elders eat veg during Durga Puja but it is not that much big problem for the young people to eat Non-Veg during Durga Puja but the only requirement is if anyone wants to eat Non-Veg then they have to eat outside their home but one of my cousin brother who also lives in our village, performs rituals in temple during Durga Puja so for him it is strictly not allowed to eat Non-Veg during Durga Puja including Onion and Garlic but after Dashami there is no problem in eating Non-Veg so after Dashami we eat Non-Veg. But I think these rules may vary for people belonging from different places or cities from West Bengal like Kolkata and all. ",

If Durga Puja is held in any family( percentage is very low) , you will never have non-veg dishes at their except may be on the last day , i.e, Navami. Otherwise when we celebrate DP in a community, we have non-veg every day. Now here is also a catch. Usually women who are married and have kids have veg on Shashthi(1st day of the 5 day celebration). Ma Shashthi is the Goddess of Children. Ashtami, the main Puja day, when we offer Pushpanjali, we usually fast till the anjali and eat Veg on that day. Now if you have roots in Bangladesh/ East Bengal, they usually never take veg but opt for fish specialy Hilsa on that day. Navami is usually mutton for all whether East or West Bengali. Hope you are not confused! ",

On the other days, from Mahalaya to Dashami, they are free to eat anything they wish. Though there is no such \u201crule\u201d. It depends on what their family tradition is. ",
