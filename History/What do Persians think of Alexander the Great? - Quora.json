            "answer_text": "This idea of Greeks and Persians is romanticized mainly by Americans. It is another means to spin hatred for the \u201cdesignated Boogyman\u201d. Modern day Iranians do not think about, nor live in 300 BC. I suspect modern Greeks have bigger fish to fry as well. As far as invaders go, far more destrcutive and barbaric ones have crossed Iran\u2019s path. That is apart of every ancient civilization\u2019s legacy. The important point is how they survive the assault. Other than the dispicable act of buring down Persepolis, I\u2019d say Alexander fully imbraced and assimilated into the Persian culture. Because of that, he is not the most hated invader. He married Roxana, daughter of a Persian novelty. He began to dress as a Persian man and ordered his Generals to so as well. It is quite clear that he had an obsession with Persia and lived the rest of his days within the Persian empire. Greeks were not pleased with his ways. Since this question is painfully redundant, I was compelled to provide some prespective. ",

The Persians messed with the Greek bull and they got the horns. In a BIG way\u2026 ",
