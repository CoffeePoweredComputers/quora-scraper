            "answer_text": "It\u2019s all relative. In fact, relatively speaking, Germany had less Jews within her borders for the last 2 centuries than the countries surrounding her plus the Pale in Tsarist\u2019 Russia. This is because anti-Semitism was much more rampant in Germany than in other Western- and Middle-European countries. The several Germanic states that from 1870 on formed Germany had a very diverse set of anti Jewish laws, forbidding them to do trade etc. Every now and then anti-Semitic hysteria flared up and the Jews got kicked out once again. It\u2019s the reason why Poland relatively speaking has had the largest Jewish community of Europe - most of them came from Germany. Jewish Population of Europe Before the Holocaust Map Jewish Population of Europe in 1933: Population Data by Country Both list and map are fairly accurate with both stating the number of Jews a little too low and in the Netherlands a bit more incorrect as 165.000, where it should be app. 250.000 - after all, app. 210.000 Dutch Jews got killed in the Holocaust and those who didn\u2019t get killed returned home again, unlike their Polish and Russian counterparts. What becomes clear is that the Jewish population in Germany was not even one per cent of the population, while still having the largest community of Western- and Middle-Europe, where countries like Hungary and the Netherlands and others exceed 1 per cent. Why was there still a considerable portion of those 500.000+ Jews in Germany when the Holocaust broke out? For a few reasons: Up until Kristallnacht, many Jews didn\u2019t suspect that a murdering machine was coming their way, or at least that there was no future for them in the country that had been their home for centuries - most intelligentsia had left Germany already in the weeks following the 30th of January 1933;Not everybody had the means to travel to distant countries or didn\u2019t want to leave everything they built up in their lives behind based on a hunch - also the German state started charging those who wished to leave Germany;Before November 1938, or more specific, Kristallnacht, surrounding countries as well as countries in other parts of the world were not at all eager to take up Jews. In fact at the conference of Evian in Switzerland in the summer of 1938, it was agreed that the participating countries would criticize Germany for her treatment of the Jews, but at the same time severely limit the number of Jews to be accepted. They de facto closed the borders for Jewish refugees per official decree, basically making official what already had been practice the previous years. Only after Kristallnacht the rest of the world opened her eyes to what was coming towards the Jews of Germany and countries started to open their borders for German Jews. The Evian ConferenceAfter the 1st of September 1939, when war had been declared, it had become impossible (financially) for the Jews to leave Germany, had they plans to do so as all means and bank accounts by now were confiscated by the German State. Later that year or early 1940, the borders were completely closed and nobody could leave Germany anymore.",

            "answer_text": "Rule of thumb: Jews, as well as other people, lives where they are allowed to live. If they have a choice they are likely to chose a place where they have the best opportunities. In the beginning Jews had a hart time to find a place to live. After the Jewish uprising 66\u201370 AD the Romans decided to punish the Jews by not allow Jews to live in the Holy Land. Jews could live wherever they wanted to in the Roman Empire, except the Holy Land. A hard punishment because the Jewish religion stipulates that Jews may only live in The Holy Land. When Christianity became compulsory in the Empire an exception was made for Jews. This is exception remained when the Empire was gone. It was however disputed. Everyone in a specific state had to belong to the state church. In times of religious or nationalistic enthusiasm the exception for Jews was questioned. Germany Thus Jews were forced to leave Western Europe when nation states were established. They had to go east. Germany and even more Poland became attractive locations for Jews. Germany did not become a united nation state until 1870. The German Empire that was created in 1870 was never hostile to Jews. Contrary. When Gernany annexed Elssas and Lothringen the Jews were the only one who celebrated (Note; German speaking Christians of the two provinces did not rejoiced. Only the Jews). Jews had no reason to leave Germany before Nazism. Poland The bulk of the Jews killed by the Nazis came from Poland. The reason was that Jews had been allowed to live in Poland for centuries. Tgere was no pressure from the Polish society to convert Jews to Christianity or to main steam Polish culture. The Jews in Poland lived in their life in peace in their own communities. Hungary Another country with many Jews was Hungary. The reason was that Hungary experienced a huge threat from the German speaking rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, and later from the Austrian Empire, who wanted to convert their empire to a German nation state. The Magyars rallied around their nation. Their counter vision was a Magyar nation state. The Magyar vision was threaded not only from the outside by Germans but also from the inside by Slavic people. The result was a Hungarian nationalism that accepted anyone who learned Hungarian. People who disliked Jews were willing to accept Jews if they spoke Hungarian. Thus many Jews moved to Hungary, learned Magyar and became Hungarian Jews. ",
