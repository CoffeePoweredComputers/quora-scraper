            "answer_text": "Not really, no. Since the end of World War II, there has been a prevailing notion that Hitler and Stalin agreed in secret to invade Poland together. However, this represents something of an oversimplification and the theory has persisted for decades largely because of the atmosphere of the Cold War. Since the Soviets were the new enemy after the war ended, historians and academics tended to stick to the theory that Stalin was always looking to be friends with Hitler and only joined the Alliance out of necessity. However, this view ignores the complexity of Soviet politics and foreign policy leading up to the war in 1939. In addition, this argument has been almost completely dispelled since the end of the Cold War, which led to the opening of the Soviet archives. Thanks to the access historians had to diplomatic cables and official government documents from this period, a better understanding has emerged. TL:DR: The short version is that the Soviets signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 to ensure that the Germans wouldn\u2019t be a threat to them in the event that they went to war with Poland. Far from what Cold War historians have argued, the treaty was not the culmination of Soviet efforts to get Nazi Germany on their side. It was actually a treaty signed in haste by the Soviets because they sensed that war was impending and their efforts to get an alliance with Britain and France had failed. The Soviets invaded Poland from the east not because they had agreed in advance to divide Poland between them, but because they grew fearful that the Germans would advance into eastern Poland and threaten the Soviet Union\u2019s borders. While it was a cowardly move and was followed by Stalin\u2019s usual crimes against humanity, it too was an act made in haste by a paranoid dictator. Long version: To break it down, the Soviets had been seeking a mutual defense pact with the western Allies since 1935. By then, Stalin had come to grips with the fact that Hitler and the Nazis were firmly in power, and they knew that Hitler\u2019s long-term goal included an invasion of the Soviet Union. Not only did he see them as the bulwark of international communism (which he claimed was an \u201cinternational Jewish plot\u201d), he also proclaimed that land in the east would be turned into living space (Lebensraum) for the \u201cAryan people\u201d.  As a result, Soviet diplomacy from 1935 to 1939 was overwhelmingly directed at securing an alliance against Nazi Germany. These efforts were spearheaded by Maxim Litvinov - the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs from 1930 to 1939 - who persistently made the case for \u201cCollective Security\u201d through the League of Nations. For years, Litvinov (an Anglophile and a Russian Jew to boot) had been arguing for rapprochement with the west and with the rise of Nazi Germany in 1933, he began to be taken very seriously. Unfortunately, his efforts proved to be largely in vain, partly because of Stalin\u2019s purges and Great Terror and partly because of anti-communist paranoia in the west. From 1935 to 1938, the best Litvinov could do was to secure a mutual defense pact between Czechoslovakia, France, and the Soviet Union. The agreement stipulated that if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia, France and the Soviet Union would come to her defense (but only if France mobilized first). This pact became null and void by 1938 thanks to the Sudeten Crisis and Hitler\u2019s decision to invade Czechoslovakia shortly thereafter. As a result of this, Litvinov became embittered and cynical in his outlook and repeatedly expressed his disbelief that any agreement could be reached. In both instances, the western Allies stood by while Germany blatantly defied international law and its own agreements. By 1939, Germany was triggering a crisis again, this time with Poland. At this point, Stalin had replaced Litvinov with Molotov - some say to secure his control over foreign affairs, others because he blamed Litvinov for not securing a mutual defense pact with the west. Regardless, Molotov was now responsible for securing this alliance and pursued it energetically (whereas Litvinov had become cynical). For months, he continued to press the British and French for an alliance while also listening to German overtures.  The Germans, it should be noted, were looking for a non-aggression pact with the Soviets to secure their eastern flank when they invaded Poland. As always, the Soviets liked to hedge their bets so that they wouldn\u2019t get stuck pulling someone else\u2019s \u201cchestnuts out of the fire.\u201d But the reception the German officials got was generally quite frosty and it didn\u2019t look like an agreement would be reached. However, Molotov\u2019s efforts would prove to be futile. As crisis loomed between Germany and Poland during the summer of 1939, the Soviets pushed for a meeting with the western Allies to hammer out an agreement for a mutual defense pact that would mobilize if Germany invaded Poland. After dragging their heels, the British and French sent delegations that not only failed to bring accurate data on their military forces, they also did not have any authority to negotiate. On top of that, neither lifted a finger to convince Poland to allow Soviet troops onto their soil in the event of war. By August 21st, Hitler personally made overtures to Stalin for a non-aggression pact. Realizing that there was no agreement to be had with the western Allies, Stalin quickly agreed to send Molotov to entreat with Ribbentrop. The resulting Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed on August 23rd, 1939, which called for a 10-year non-aggression pact, arbitration if either party disagreed, neutrality if either went to war against a third power, and forbade membership in alliances that were \u201cdirectly or indirectly aimed at the other.\u201d The treaty also contained a Secret Additional Protocol (which was not released until after the war). This protocol effectively divided southeastern Europe, the Baltic States, Poland, and Scandinavia into two \u201cspheres of influence.\u201d In the case of Poland, the western portion would be assigned to Germany whereas the areas east of the Pisa, Narev, Vistula, and San rivers would be assigned to the Soviet Union. Given that the Soviets invaded these regions less than a month later, historians saw this protocol as a partition agreement between two powers hellbent on expansion.  However, this fails to acknowledge a few very important facts. First of all, there\u2019s the actual text of the treaty, which stated that: \u201cIn the event of a territorial and political rearrangement of the areas belonging to the Polish state, the spheres of influence of Germany and the U.S.S.R. shall be bounded approximately by the line of the rivers Narev, Vistula and San. The question of whether the interests of both parties make desirable the maintenance of an independent Polish States and how such a state should be bounded can only be definitely determined in the course of further political developments. In any event both Governments will resolve this question by means of a friendly agreement.\u201d In effect, the secret protocol didn\u2019t call for the partitioning of Poland. It placed limits on how far the German army could advance and occupy in the event of war. It also left the door open for an independent Polish state in both nation\u2019s spheres. Second, there\u2019s the question of dates. The Nazis invaded Poland on Sept. 1st, Britain and France declared war two days later, and didn\u2019t order in the troops until the 17th - a full sixteen days after the invasion began. In addition, it was five days after the German Army had completely occupied all of Poland west of the Vistula river (Sept. 12th) and began laying siege to Warsaw. At this point, Stalin was becoming nervous that ongoing Polish resistance might compel the Germans to violate the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and cross into eastern Poland. As such, he ordered the Red Army to invade and decimate the remaining Polish military forces (the Katyn Massacre). The Soviets would continue to engage of wars of expansion for the next two years, which included the Russo-Finnish War of 1940 (aka. The Winter War) and the annexation of the Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia). However, Soviet documents from the time strongly indicate that this was all motivated by Stalin\u2019s paranoid drive to create buffer regions around the Soviet Union that he thought would be strategically advantageous when Nazi Germany invaded - which they did in the summer of 1941 (aka. Operation Barbarossa).  Conclusion: World War II officially began on Sept. 3rd, 1939, when Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany in response to Hitler\u2019s invasion of Poland. Stalin\u2019s actions, while craven, cowardly, and duplicitous, did not contribute to the start of the war. In truth, he was reacting to a situation he was not in control of and those reactions were largely dictated by his failure to secure an agreement with Britain and France over Poland (as well as his usual paranoid megalomania). This does not mean that France, Britain, and especially Poland were wrong to not trust the Soviets. Stalin\u2019s policies throughout the 1930s severely hurt the Soviet Union\u2019s reputation and completely undermined Litvinov\u2019s efforts to secure a collective security agreement. Whether it was him committing mass murder at home or duplicitous actions abroad, Stalin destroyed what little credibility and goodwill the Soviet Union had built up since the early 1920s. In truth, it seems as though there was no correct course of action during this time, just the one that presented the fewest consequences for each party. By 1941, the Soviets, the US, and Britain would find themselves on the same side, battling Nazi Germany and the Axis with the very fate of the world hanging in the balance. And once the war was over, former allies would henceforth be Cold War enemies. ",

            "answer_text": "Not exactly. Although both armies were on the offensive in September 1939, Hitler and Stalin had very different reasons for doing so. With Hitler it was pretty cut and dry expansionism. Although Stalin wanted to expand Soviet influence, he really didn't have any plans to do so until Germany was already going to be thrusting Europe into war. When Hitler was rearming Germany in the mid 30s, Stalin reached out to Britain and France to see if they would work with him to contain nazism. They all but said that they viewed communism as a greater threat, and would not work with him. When they all but handed Czechoslovakia to Hitler at the Munich conference in 1938, Stalin saw that he would have to do whatever he had to in order to secure his frontiers. When Hitler reached out to him in August 1939, and the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact was signed, Stalin used it to buy time to rebuild his army, and to expand Soviet borders by swallowing half of Poland, the Baltic States and southeastern Finland. In short, Stalin would deal with whoever would deal with him. He did not want war, but he made his deal with the devil in order to buy time to prepare against the eventual German invasion of his country ",
