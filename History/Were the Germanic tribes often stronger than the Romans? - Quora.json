            "answer_text": "The Romans came up face to face with the Nervii tribe in 57 BC who were taller and fought viciously. However the Roman legions formed a phalanx, and first of all fired a thin spear of soft iron which when stuck in the enemy shield bent and made the shield useless. The Romans proceeded to cut down the Nervii with their short swords until they had killed so many of the Nervii the bodies were piled six feet high. this Roman method of combat was hard to beat and was nearly always successful. The battle of Teutoburg forest was completetly different. The three legions were strung out through the German forest led by Arminius and were forced into single combat which devastated the Romans as they could not form a phalanx and thus all Three legions were beaten. They were led by Publius Quincctilius Varus who along withe some other survivors committed suicide. The battle lasted four days and 20,000 Roman soldiers were killed. This showed the superiority of single combat of the Germanic tribe over the Romans. ",

            "answer_text": "Stronger in what sense? Man to man Germanic tribes COULDbe called stronger physically i think in indiv combat..weapons were longer and farther reach. In *the mill* the Romans fought not individually but as a mass.and were far more disciplined. tHE rOMANS were lethal opponets at close quarters that was their strength they had swords far shorter than Germanic tribes. Spears were used at distance by Romans then they closed for close range fighting with solid mass of shields and swords. The Germans would hold ground for short periods and fight but at some point for whatever reason they would flee the battle area in many cases. Mostly due to reason the Roman legion was a machine of relentless butchery and they simply kept going break the enemy line and keep attacking ND KILLING. tHE FEW TIMES A LEGION WALL BROKE THE TRIBES COULD DESTROY A LEGION. bUT asanswer to your question i say on overall view the Romans were smaller and faster physically and disciplined. The Germanic tribes were not they were mostly in berserker mold\u2026you work self and fellows into battle frenzy and attack it was an all out assault\u2019 ",
