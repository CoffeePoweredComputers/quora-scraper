            "answer_text": "The 9mm Mk. 1A pistol made by the Indian Ordinance Factory is a licensed copy of the Browning HiPower. It is illegal for civilians to own in India according to the 1959 Arms Act and is manufactured only for use by Military and Police forces in India and Pakistan. Availability outside of India and Pakistan is very limited as it\u2019s easier to just buy the actual Browning Hi-Power elsewhere, or one of the other cheap copies made in other countries. An actual Browning HiPower can be purchased on the US market for about $500. Though I have heard of of a few showing up on the US market, the 1A is too rare to easily put a value on. The machining quality is said to be very inferior to real HiPowers, but the rarity of the item could inflate the value on the other side to a collector. Despite the rarity, I would expect the value to be less than $500 due to the poor quality of manufacture and availability of other cheap HiPower copies made in places like Bulgaria and Turkey. If you are looking for black market prices, this is not the forum for that. Quora is very good about keeping discussions legal and above board. ",
