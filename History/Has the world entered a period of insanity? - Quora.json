( can barely tell can you? Box checked) Mothers and fathers will be killing their children and children will rise up and kill their parents. ( it\u2019s all over the news for years now.. box checked) Wars will be many.. nations will rise up in the name of Religion and there will be wars and talks of more wars to come ( All of this is over Holy land. Do your research if you need to. Radical Muslims against the kafirs. Google kafirs. Jews, gentiles, and any non radicalized Muslims included. All of them are being murdered beheaded or killed anyway possible as ordered in the interpretation of certain radicals. Box checked) We have people eating people as well also prophesied. Didn\u2019t see that coming but thanks to these new weird drugs they have, BOOM we now have real flesh eating zombies. You can thank the Chinese for that. They came up with these brilliant compounds and have been shipping them over here via US postal service. Pppft it\u2019s just so easy it\u2019s like\u2026 Insanity right? Yes is my answer ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes it feels like that, doesn\u2019t it! I\u2019m supposing that it has to do with the visible failures of the institutions that we have relied upon for the last century or so (probably more, actually) to hold our societies together and guide our behaviors. These structures have not been universally supported, but the people who wanted to bring them down or change them radically have been in the minority and had less power than they now do. I don\u2019t mean to say they are criminally involved, though those of us who are frightened would want to say so. I do believe that the insatiable desire for ALWAYS MORE, by governments and individuals, has prompted an amoral attack on these centuries-old institutions, religions, laws, governmental structures, societal norms, in the search for ever more profit, wealth, and power. So, what happens next? With our natural planetary systems in dire danger of collapse, who in the world can say! ",

As it was written, so shall it be: The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.
