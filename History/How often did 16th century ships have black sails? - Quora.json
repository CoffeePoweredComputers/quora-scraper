            "answer_text": "ALMOST FREAKIN NEVER. This notion has been highly romanticized by the film industry to show the glory of the pirates and brigands of the \u201cAge of Piracy\u201d. Sails are huge. Like HUGE. They cost a lot to shape and change. Most sails were whatever color they came in, usually variations of grey, tan, sackcloth.. you get the point. White-ish was pretty standard because it was a natural color and deflected the heat of the sun. Now imagine being in the middle of the ocean with black sails that basically act as a magnet for heat off of the great mirror that is the ocean. Toast. Secondly, even if that wasn\u2019t a problem, and you just wanted black sails because they\u2019re cool af, dye was incredibly expensive. No one really wanted black either, more royal and bright colors like saffron, red, greens, blues and purples. The most abundant black coloring around was either ashes (bad idea for textiles), or black ink, which is even more incredibly expensive to pursue. So basically, not often. Regards UPDATE I\u2019ve had some conflicting commentary as to the application and feasibility of having blacks sails. One side of the argument points out that black objects from the past, and in today\u2019s products, decay as a substantially slower rate than that of other colors. Meaning that, even though black sails would be expensive, it could still be a wise long term investment. The other side disagrees. Another interesting perspective that has been posited is that black sails are quite obviously pirates. That grand use of blacks sails would inhibit the piracy potential of mauraders because coastal defenses would have been warned well before making contact on land or in harbor. Regards ",

            "answer_text": "I am surprised that all of the \u201clearned\u201d answers to this question have missed the obvious source of black sails. It is well known that the whaling fisheries caught (harpooned) whales at sea and rendered the blubber on board the ships, using whale oil as the fuel. This oil burned with a great deal of unburned carbon-laden smoke, which turned the sails black. Black sails did not advertise a pirate ship, but a harmless whaler! This seems like the perfect disguise for a pirate who boarded and stole a whaling ship, wanting to sneak up on unsuspecting prey. Have you ever read any books about whaling? Try Moby Dick by Herman Melville. That book was written by a man who lived in the Northeastern U.S. during the time of the whalers. ",
