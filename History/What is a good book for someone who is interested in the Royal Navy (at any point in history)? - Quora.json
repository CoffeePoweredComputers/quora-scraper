            "answer_text": "My main interest is the ships and for a very comprehensive series the late Naval Architect David K Brown is hard too beat. From \u201c before the Ironclad \u201c too \u201cRebuilding the Royal Navy\u201d his books cover from the 1820,s until the 1990,s.       If you have an interest in the early Dreadnought fire control systems this is the best available but a bit specialist.  Ian Ballantyne has some great books on specific ships.    This is a very good book about the largest gun fight ever.  If you prefer fiction this is based on actual events and started a long series.  Based on the exploits of Thomas Cochran 10th Earl of Dundonald and specifically the fight between HMS Speedy and the Spanish Frigate Gamo. This was a bit like an armed trawler taking on a heavy cruiser. I admire this ship above all others and have a first edition copy.  Recently read this and it\u2019s very good.  The Cruel Sea is a classic about the battle of the Atlantic and also a film.  American author Norman Friedman has several very good books on the RN. Hope this helps. ",

There are many official and unofficial histories of various parts of what has been for a century or more a very complex set of interrelated organisations (Fleet Air Arm, Submarine Service, Royal Marines, Frigates and Destroyer squadrons, mine countermeasures, Survey Navy etc) but this will give you a broad spectrum and probably lead you to visit a more specialist literature sources (Greenwich, Portsmouth, Dartmouth, Hampshire etc Naval libraries) ",
