            "answer_text": "America has done plenty of shitty things. Internment of Americans during WWII for being of \u2018Japanese\u2019 ancestry (giving up a bit of our moral high-ground,) our part in the Afro-European Slave Trade, just about everything we did to the Native Americans, pre-Civil Rights treatment of black people, anti-Irish racism, classicism out the ass, white supremacy, inciting a foreign civil war for our own benefit (multiple times), using the Chinese to build our railroads, being dicks to Canada and Mexico at various points in our history, The Great White Hope (a boxing thing), hell we were probably even at fault in the Boston Massacre/Riot. Do we recognize that we\u2019ve done plenty of wrong? Yes. Do we wish these hadn\u2019t been done, or regret that they are in our history? Yes. Do we feel shame? No. Most Americans either recognize that we are not accountable for the sins of our fathers, and get on with our lives, or aren\u2019t ever forced to face the sins of their fathers for one reason or another. Only a small percentage of (predominantly white) Americans feel the need to make reparations for what their ancestors did, and from what I\u2019ve observed they draw derision from both sides of the aisle.

            "answer_text": "Some might, but they shouldn't. I have slave owners down one branch of my family tree and abolitionists down another.  I'm even related to Lincoln's law partner who claims to have helped alter the President's opinion on slavery, but I am no more responsible for the emancipation then I am for the practice of slavery in the first place.  I don't believe in original sin or collective guilt or that responsibility for ancestral crimes are somehow magically transferred through the bloodline.  There is no reason to be ashamed for another person's crime.   Although there have been multiple shameful events in American history which supposedly compromise our supposed moral authority, most happened under false narratives or in secret.  So, how responsible are deceased Americans? The only thing I feel is frustration for being forced to deal with someone else's past mistakes while being almost completely powerless to affect change in the present. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly not more than the Germans, Brits, and Australians feel about their histories. As a member of an immigrant community that has been in this country for about 150 years, I feel particular pride in the USA despite the obvious missteps that any country makes during an existence of a quarter millennium.   In most respects, the US has exemplified a country that was founded on optimistic principles of the Enlightenment combined with some of the worst practices of the European colonizers, most terrible of which was slavery.  It did not invent it but certainly retained it long after the recognition of its indefensibility.With regards to native populations, the early Americans were like the early Australians or Argentinians, bristling with the desire to add new lands to the county even while forcing the aboriginal populations into reserves.   If we had never addressed these terrible issues, we would deserve whatever shame might befall us.   African- and native-Americans are Americans to a degree that north African immigrant communites in France or Turkish minorities in Germany have never become.  I went to an American baseball game with a German friend in the last week and she was surprised to see black and Latino fans singing the national anthem along with the Caucasians.  When asked, I said that they are just as American as anyone.  She was surprised by my comment as it is not the normal state of affairs in much of the EU. There is a past that includes many shameful realities; but the shame does not characterize the USA. ",

            "answer_text": "Some do and some don't.  There are generally two types of shame among Americans.  One type of shame is the idea that past wrongs must be made right with financial incentive or legal relief for a current generation despite the sins of the past. Think about the camp who advocates for financial reparations for slavery, paid to descendants. Partisanship aside, I have found shame tied to money to be a phenomenon found on the more leftward side of the American political spectrum. This goes hand in hand with their paternalistic outlook toward minorities. Then there's the type of shame where the person admits that something was done wrong and moves on with life. Am I ashamed of how this country treated the American Indian? Absolutely. Was it wrong? Yes. Do I want to create government debt to make it right? No. Admission of the wrongdoing and an apology is good enough for most people, especially if societal-level change has come about. My own opinion is that this school of thought is more right of center, but I will no doubt get flak for this thinking. ",

What's important to understand about America is that it's concerned about today and most importantly, tomorrow.  There are always outliers, but America is about reaching, striving and building. Shame plays no part in that.If this idea was brought up in the context of US politics, it would go the way of Jimmy Carter's sweater. Along with massive electoral defeat. ",

Our history is our past, but our past does not define our future. We must recognize our sins, but know how to do good and avoid it.
