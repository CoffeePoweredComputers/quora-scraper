            "answer_text": "There are no simple steps to preserve a dying empire run by an incompetent ruler. If Austria was a has been power by 1915, Russia was a dead man walking. Go back to the mid 19th century, when enough Russians had money to travel and went abroad\u2014-to Western Europe\u2014-they were astonished to see how much the rest of Europe had progressed. The Czar\u2019s response to their complaints? He ordered all Russians abroad to return, and banned further travel. A couple more Czars came and went and Nicholas was left holding the bag. Of course, while Russia was effectively out\u2014-it lost a war to Japan in 1904, it wasn\u2019t dead. The only thing different between today\u2019s Russian propaganda and the highly effective Russian propaganda and covert activity of the 19th and early 20th Century was that the UK and US were largely immune to the effects\u2014-unlike today, a sad fact that isn\u2019t because the Russians are more effective, but that the Anglo-American economic model has left so many of its people behind and thus susceptible. At one point though, back then, the Russian Okhrana set up an assassination attempt against the Czar, in Paris, in order to be able to turn over all the people they\u2019d set up to kill the Czar, to French authorities, in order to allow the French to dramatically \u201csave\u201d the Czar during a state visit, and repair strained Russo-French relations. Still, the British had sent weapons to Russia and worried about their security amidst Russian inactivity, they sent agents over to locate them, only to find the munitions still sitting on the docks and rail sidings where\u2019d they\u2019d originally been unloaded. The Germans were working to keep the Russians out of the War, the British were demanding the Czar honor his treaty obligations and open a second front, and the Czar sat back, unable to do much of anything. Things haven\u2019t improved much over the last century, with or without atomic weapons, but at least now they\u2019re dangerous regardless of whether they\u2019re on the move. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very sad story, and one of the enormous suffering of a great people, and of the failure of its once great dynastic rulers to listen sympathetically to the voice of those people. The Tsarsannual income from his estates and satellite countries was over ten million Rubles in 1910, in those days that was an astonishingly huge sum of money. It was, however, money that the ordinary Russian people seldom saw. Pay for a country school teacher was around 2.50 Rubles a month. The Revolutionaries cry was \u201cbread, land and Peace\u201d for the Russian people. Alas, the cries fell on deaf ears.  Tsar \u201cNiki\u201d with his family. During world war one, the Tsar, the Kaiser and Queen Victoria, were all members of the same Royal Family, the same bloodline.  Possibly taken at Tsarskocelo before the war.  Above. Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. Some claim the children and the mother actually survived and went to Copenhagen. Despite an official Russian funeral of bodies, not everyone is satisfied the Romanovs really all died. There has been a story for some years, that the Kaiser did a \u201cdeal\u201d with the Bolsheviks, to return Lenin in exchange for the Royal family, minus the tsar himself. Certainly, German command knew in advance the day and the hour that the TSAR himself was to be executed and appear to have made an effort to rescue the others to safety, out of the kaisers great shame and guilt for starting the war which destroyed his cousins own family and rulership over Russia. There seems to be no other reason that the Germans were in contact with the Bolsheviks other than to try a rescue or \u201cdeal\u201d attempt to save the Princess Alexandra of Hesse Cassel and her Romanovs children. (The Tsarina was from the Germano Royal house of Hesse Cassel). Alix had relied heavily upon the faith healer, the \u201cmad monk\u201d Rasputin\u201d to heal her frail, sick son Alexie, who suffered from a rare blood disease. but Rasputin caused a scandal which weakened the Royal Dictatorship, the \u201cabsolute\u201d rule of the Tsar \u2019s family over Russia.  Above. Portrait of Grigori Efimovitch Rasputin (1869-1916) among his followers (Russia). The Russian meaning of the name \u201cRasputin\u201d means \u201cDissolute one\u201d. Rasputin was given poison, but the poison did not work, so he was assassinated y Pistol. But it was already too late, Rasputin had tarnished the image of the royalty, and there had been a scandal.

General N.Lokhvitskiy inspecting positions accompanied by Russian and French Officers in the summer of 1916 in Champagne  The Russian Expeditionary Force (French: CorpsExp\u00e9ditionnaire Russe en France) was a World War I military force sent to France by the Russian Empire. In1915 the French requested that Russian troops be sent to fight alongside their own army on the Western Front.   Russia sent an army to fight in Europe against the Germans, but Russia collapsed, and the Germans actually got a very long way right up into the interior of Russia during World War One. There are even hushed whispers and rumours the German Kaiser mounted a rescue attempt for the children and wife of the Tsar and sent a Military German train to siding number 71 at PERM to rescue the Romanov children and his wife who was the German princess Alexandra of \u201cHesse\u201d Cassel. King George V of England.  The King of England was Tsar Nikolas cousin but was too afraid of upsetting public or political \u201copinion\u201d to accept the Tsar and his family to safety from the Revolution. He is therefore extremely guilty for their deaths later because of his cowardice. From RT. Pictured arm in arm wearing yachting uniforms, the two future kings could be mistaken for twins. But while cousins Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Britain\u2019s King George V were described as close friends, their relationship ended in ruthless circumstances. As head of an empire that was waning, where many citizens experienced extreme poverty and autocratic rule, Nicholas II found himself caught between a world war and the discontent of his own people. The explosive mix would hasten his fall from monarch to executed prisoner in just over a year. End RT. Below.

Despite Russias enormous financial income and wealth, the Tsar had failed to equip his own army properly. (just where did all that money really go?). The Russian Tsar gifted expensive, lavish beautiful gifts to his family, but everyone living in his country was poor, and starving and living in poor housing. Below. The Faberge Coronation Egg.

Historically, Faberg\u00e9 made Imperial Eggs for the Russian royal family, who were renowned for their extravagant and lavish tastes. The last ImperialFaberge Egg was commissioned 99 years ago by Tsar Nicholas II as a present for his wife, Empress Alexandra, just months before he was overthrown in the Russian Revolution. His father, Tsar Alexander III, had started the tradition by giving jewelled Easter eggs in 1885 when he commissioned the Hen Egg as a 20th wedding anniversary gift for his wife. Out of the 50 Imperial Faberge Eggs that were commissioned by the Tsars, 43 are believed to have survived the Revolution and all but two of these have been recovered. The third Imperial Egg was dramatically rescued from the scrapheap last year and has since been sold to a private collector. There were many beautiful eggs, but not all are thought or believed to have, survived the revolution. Sometimes, however, they do \u201csomehow\u201d turn up again for sale\u2026.  below. German troops en route to East Prussia to fend off the invasion of Germany from the east by the Russian Army--an invasion launched although the Russians were not sufficiently mobilized. The Russians had responded to urgent appeals from France for action in the east to divert German resources from the Western Front. This bought time for the French and British, allowing them to better organize their own troops, and hurt the Germans by cutting down on the number of troops invading France. Shown above, Russian soldiers on the Eastern Front take aim. Men in the second line do not have rifles, indicative of the serious equipment problems affecting the Russian Army from the start.   German troops entered Russia after the Tsar fell. The killing of Nicholas II, tsar from 1894 until his forced abdication in 1917, saw the collapse of Russia\u2019s royal family. His grisly death in 1918 and the murder of the Romanov family by a Bolshevik firing squad at a house in Ekaterinburg also placed George V\u2019s reputation under scrutiny. \u201c[George V] realized that, to most of his subjects, the tsar was a bloodstained tyrant\u2026 that this was no time for a constitutional monarch, apprehensive of his own position, to be extending the hand of friendship to an autocrat \u2013 however closely related. So the Russian imperial family was left to its fate,\u201d Aronson said. Historian Catherine Merridale, the author of \u2018Lenin on the Train,\u2019 refers to an offer of asylum being withdrawn on \u201cpersonal and diplomatic grounds.\u201d She claims that Sir George Buchanan, the British ambassador to Russia, had initially brokered a passage to Britain, only for it to fall through. Numerous archive images show the two kings from across Europe together. Some of the most striking photos are of the pair dressed in near-matching sailing attire and posing for what appears to be a royal portrait. The pictures hint at a close bond, which makes suggestions that Nicholas II\u2019s relatives in Britain refused or were passive in trying to save him all the more intriguing.  Did the king of England sell the tsar and his family down the river to preserve his own power base, or was he put under pressure by a government to ignore an SOS in the midst of the more pressing matter of fighting World War I?  The English King failed to help his own family for Political reasons. Shown here, tsar Nikolas with George v of England. the two men were close family cousins.  Russian Revolutionary people. Below. Soldiers from the Russian Army join with the marching Russian Revolutionaries.   Red October. The Dawn of the Communist world and the Russian Revolution spelled doom to the Russian tsarist Regime, which was deposed from power. The Russian Revolution in October 1917,1 led by the Bolshevik Party of Vladimir Lenin, is the most important event in history for revolutionary socialists. In the October Revolution (November in the Gregorian calendar), the Bolsheviks led an armed insurrection by workers and soldiers in Petrograd that successfully overthrew the Provisional Government, transferring all its authority to the Soviets with the capital being relocated to Moscow shortly thereafter. The Bolsheviks had secured a strong base of support within the Soviets and, as the now supreme governing party, established a Federal Government dedicated to reorganizing the former empire into the world's first socialist republic, practicing Soviet Democracy on a national and international scale. The promise to end Russia's participation in the First World War was honoured promptly with the Bolshevik leaders signing the Treaty of Brest_Litovsk with Germany in March 1918. To further secure the new state, the Cheka was established which functioned as a revolutionary security service that sought to weed out and punish those considered to be \"enemies of the people\" in campaigns consciously modelled on similar events during the French Revolution. The badge of the feared new Soviet secret police, the \u201cCheka\u201d. The CHEKA (sometimes called VeCHEKA) was the much-feared Bolshevik secret police \u2013 though to most Russians the CHEKA was no secret. The CHEKA was formed in the wake of the October 1917 revolution, established as a small agency to investigate and deal with threats to the new regime. It was to be the \u201csword and shield of the revolution\u201d, defending the Soviet regime by attacking its enemies within. But as opposition to the new regime grew through 1918 so too did the size and scope of the CHEKA. Led by Felix Dzerzhinsky, a fanatical Bolshevik and ruthless operator cut from a similar mould as Lenin, the CHEKA ballooned from a couple of hundred investigators to a bureaucratic and paramilitary behemoth, containing more than 100,000 agents. More significantly, the CHEKA operated outside the rule of law. It acted of its own accord, investigated and arrested whoever it chose, and answered to no one. The CHEKA became a model for 20th century secret police agencies in totalitarian states, including the Gestapo (Nazi Germany), the Stasi(East Germany) and the KGB (Soviet Russia).  A badge of the feared Soviet secret Police, the \u201cCheka\u201d.  Soon after, civil war erupted among the \"Reds\" (Bolsheviks), the \"Whites \" (counter-revolutionaries ), the independence movements and the non-Bolshevik socialists. It continued for several years, during which the Bolsheviks defeated both the Whites and all rival socialists and thereafter reconstituted themselves as the Communist party.  Along with the heroic sailor soviet, and the battleship Potemkin, the Russian Army which Tsar Nikolas had sent to Europe to fight alongside the Allies in France, mutinied and demanded to return home. In fact, the Military authorities became afraid, and for some time, the Mutinied Russian army was surrounded by a perimeter to cordon them off in case of armed revolt, but this never happened. The Russian Expeditionary Force (To say in French it is \u201cCorps Exp\u00e9ditionnaire Russe en France\u201d) was a World War I military \u201cWhite Russian\u201d force sent to France by the Tsarist Russian Empire. In 1915 the French requested that Russian troops be sent to fight alongside their own army on the Western Front. Initially, they asked for 300,000 men, an unrealistically high figure, probably based on assumptions about Russia's 'unlimited'military reserves General Mikhail Alexseev , the Imperial Chief of Staff, was opposed to sending any Russian troops, although Nicholas ii finally agreed to send a unit of brigade-strength. In fact, an initial force of 45,000 men was sent. The First Russian Special Brigade finally landed at the French Southern port of Marseille in April 1916. A Second Special Brigade was also sent to serve alongside other Allied formations on the Salonika Front in northern Greece. In France, the First Brigade participated in the Robert Nivelle however with news of the Russian Revolution of 1917 affecting the demoralization within the French Army following the failure of that offensive, the 1st and 3rd Brigades participated in the wave of Mutinies spreading across France. The First Brigade was finally disbanded before the end of the year. However, the Honorary Russian Legion (To say in Fench language:\u201d L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur Russe\u201d) of the 1st Morrocan Division continued to maintain a Russian presence in the west and, indeed in the First world war itself, until the Armistice of 1918. The soldiers were sent home. To a totally \u201cdifferent\u201d country Politically than the one, they had left a few months earlier to go to Europe to fight. Soviet groups had banded together to create a Revolutionary new Government in Russia. This came to be known as \u201cCommunism\u201d. The Russian Red Communist flag.   Above. The Russian Flag.  Above.The old imperial flag of Tsarist Russia under the Russian Royal family. Revolution had been silently smoking, simmering and finaly reaching boiling point for many years in Russia. In 1917, two revolutions swept through Russia, ending centuries of imperial rule and setting into motion political and social changes that would lead to the formation of the Soviet Union . While the two revolutionary events took place within a few short months, social unrest in Russia had been simmering for decades. In the early 1900s, Russia was one of the most impoverished countries in Europe with an enormous peasantry and a growing minority of poor industrial workers. Much of Western Europe viewed Russia as an undeveloped, backwards society. The Russian Empire practiced serfdom\u2014a form of feudalism in which landless peasants were forced to serve the land-owning nobility\u2014well into the nineteenth century. In contrast, the practice had disappeared in most of Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages In 1861, the Russian Empire finally abolished serfdom. The emancipation of serfs would influence the events leading up to the Russian Revolution by giving peasants more freedom to organize. Russian Revolution of 1905 Russia industrialized much later than Western Europe and the United States. When it finally did, around the turn of the 20th century, it brought with it immense social and political changes. Between 1890 and 1910, for example, the population of major Russian cities such as St. Petersburg and Moscow nearly doubled, resulting in overcrowding and destitute living conditions for a new class of Russian industrial workers. A population boom at the end of the 19th century, a harsh growing season due to Russia\u2019s northern climate, and a series of costly wars\u2014starting with the Crimea War (1854-1856)\u2014meant frequent food shortages across the vast empire. Large protests by Russian workers against the monarchy led to the Bloody Sunday Massacre. Hundreds of unarmed protesters were killed or wounded by the czar\u2019s troops. The massacre sparked the Russian Revolution of 1905 during which angry workers responded with a series of crippling strikes throughout the country. Nicholas II After the bloodshed of 1905, Tsar Nicholas promised the formation of a series of representative assemblies, or Dumas, to work toward reform. Russia entered into World War One in August 1914 in support of the Serbs and their French and British allies. Their involvement in the war would soon prove disastrous for the Russian Empire. Militarily, imperial Russia was no match for industrialized Germany, and Russian casualties were greater than those sustained by any nation in any previous war. Food and fuel shortages plagued Russia as inflation mounted. The economy was hopelessly disrupted by the costly war effort. The Russian Revolution was a pair of separate revolutions in Russia n 1917 which dismantled the Tsarist Autocracy and led to the rise of theSoviet union The Russian Empire of Tsarist \u201cWhiteRussia\u201d collapsed with the abdication of Emperor Nicholas the 1st, and the old regime was replaced by a temporary or provisional Government, during the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the Gregorian Calendar; the older Julian Calendar was in use in Russia at the time). Alongside it arose grassroots community assemblies (called Soviets ') which contended for authority. In the second revolution that October, the Provisional Government was toppled and all power was given to the Soviets. The Bolsheviks has taken over the peoples revolution, and the Tsar and all his family (???) were executed. But that is \u201canother story\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "There were no simple steps. Russia suffered some of the same limitations and problems the rest of Europe did in the early years of the Great War - high casualty rates (especially officers - very hard to train/replace), shortages of field artillery and shells, lack of preparation for a long war, poor infrastructure for movement of troops and supplies to where the war was fought, lack of an overall cohesive strategy, etc. Compounding these were some basic issues inherent with Russia - size of the country, transportation of resources, dispersed industry for war production, autocratic governance that was less reactive to changes/issues in the progress of the war, and a very recent history of subversive revolutionary groups who became emboldened politically and practically as the war progressed. Crisis and battle defeats on several areas of the front throughout 1914 and into 1915 worsened the situation dramatically, causing the government to take drastic action, to include one of the worse decisions possible - for the Tsar to take direct control of the military just as his presence in Petrograd was necessary to salvage the domestic issues plaguing the war effort. Most countries suffered similar issues, but not all at once, and not to the scale that Russia faced. The other allies also had easy trade routes to the Americas that Russia simply could not match, with only their Pacific ports open to any supplies - at the end of a very long rail link and wide oceanic gap. As David Stone writes in his book and states in this excellent lecture \u2018Everybody had these problems, but it was worse for Russia\u2019.  I highly recommend this man\u2019s books on the subject.

It took nationalization and scientific planning and optimization to turn Russia into a superpower. Czarist government began to implement steps proposed by Manikovsky, but was overthrown by combined efforts of Anglo-French imperialism and Russian oligarchy that lost opportunity to sell weapons at twice their price. Yet before the liberal coup overthrew czar, catastrophic shortages of weapons and ammo was over. Soviet government took where czar left, fully implementing the steps.

I don\u2019t see how Russia could have avoided going to war. The alternative was abandonment of its aims to dominate the Balkans and the Bosphorus. The alternative was abandonment of its alliances with Britain and France. But if Germany attacked France (it did), and if this attack brought Britain into the war (the related German attack on the Low Countries did), Russia could only choose between fighting then with allies and risking fighting later without allies. If Germany had defeated Britain and France, it would have been able to marshal overwhelming armies and resources to defeat Czarist Russia even more rapidly than it did. So, I do not see what Russia could have done. Howard Lederman ",

Russia had a big army, but it was poorly supplied, poorly armed, poorly trained and full of resentful conscripts on 25 year terms of service. Moreover, many of those conscripts were not ethnic Russians, but Jews, Ukrainians, Poles, Kazakhs, Turkmens and other oppressed minorities who had little reason to love or fight for the Czar. The Russian railways were also notoriously poor and unreliable, and WW1 was very much a railway war. Without them, your troops and supplies would never be where they were supposed to be. ",

Pre ww1 Russia was like a shithole at best, people were poor and starving as well as revolting, they should increase the pay of normal peasants and ask for support from other countries. The Russians should also have created more factories to keep up arms and ammo production and produce more railways and trains as well as find ways to increase the harvest. All of these were lacking in ww1. The Russian army lacked NCO's they were in no shortage of Captains or Generals. The Russians should also have trained their soldiers to fight in smaller formations like in squads or platoons. Because of the lack of NCO's most of the training was done by as a company or a battalion, this caused the average rifleman to fight as a big unit of 100 or more men when their commanders fall in battle they normally get confused and rout. The army should finally create better tactics for war as early on and in the middle to the end of the war observers would say that they charged into battle bayonet first with bugles playing with or without support. Good men were killed or wounded in a mlfew short moments. ",

Alone of the major powers, they had fairly recent combat experience with the available technology from the Russo-Japanese War, and knew what to expect in terms of trenches, machine guns, rapid-fire artillery and the rest. This showed dramatically in the Battles for Galicia in the opening months, as time and again their tactics and troops proved superior to Austria-Hungary\u2019s. What hurt Russia were structural and geographic problems it couldn\u2019t really fix. It was an absolute monarchy with a dutiful but ineffective monarch at its head. Nicholas II didn\u2019t have the strength of character to purge the officer corps of incompetents and time-servers, resulting in the botched East Prussia offensive in 1914 that saw the destruction of Second Army under Samsonov and the crippling of the First Army under Rennenkampf, two generals that refused to co-operate or even communicate as they invaded German soil. Russia\u2019s industrial base was weak, and the decision to convert it entirely to war production meant no consumer goods were made for the countryside, breaking down the exchange of goods for foodstuffs and resulting in hunger and privation for the factory workers. Russia couldn\u2019t import goods due to the closure of the Baltic by the Germans and the Black Sea by the Turks, and Russia\u2019s geographic immensity made transporting troops and supplies to the front difficult. Russia managed to sustain its war effort for over three years before its social structure fractured under the strain. The army outlasted the Tsar and the home front, and didn\u2019t really go home until the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918. ",

Russia had not much to gain on a war while most countries were drawn into the war by the follies and errors of judgement that affected the other great powers of Europe: imperial rivalry, poisonous nationalism, military overconfidence, too much trust in alliances and not enough in diplomacy. But while Russia entered the war for other reasons than her European neighbours, she did not do so on an equal footing. Russia\u2019s economy was still developing and reliant on foreign investment; her industrial sector was incapable of competing with the powerhouse German economy. Three years of total war would exhaust the Russian economy and leave its people starving, freezing and miserable. From this soil, the February Revolution would spring. Russia were pulled into the war during the tsar. So came the socialistic revolution which declared the war as an imperialistic war, why Russia pulled out after almost 2 million soldiers death BUT WAS NOT DEFEATED ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing! It should not have been in the war on the first place. Dozens of reasons for their defeat. Incompetent leaders, lack of infrastructure and strategic planning, lack of ammunition and arms, lack of provision and supply lines, lack of cooperation with allies and etc. I personally believe that one of the important factors was very poor intelligence and counterintelligence. Germany exploited it to the fullest, creating internal disturbances that eventually lead to October coup. ",
