            "answer_text": "Iraqi Arabs are descendants of Mesopotamians and not\u201d Arabized Mesopotamians\u201d . No doubt the confusion came from , that some people think that the Arabs came to Iraq with the Islamic conquer ( fateh ) of Iraq from the Arabian Peninsula about 630 AD. In fact Iraq was at the time an Arabic Christian Kingdom under King Noaman Ben Al-Munther from the Arab tribe of Beni Lakhem who prided himself as being called King of the Arabs . The population of Iraq just before that event was Arab Christians and Arab idol worshipers , Jews Chaldo - Assyrian Christians and all of those were descendants ,of the Semitic Mesopotamians who were in Iraq in the early bronze age 3500\u20134000 BC .So the Arabs who came with the Muslim \u201c fateh \u201c simply were a top up for the Arabs population . Going back to the Bronze Age there were the Semitic people in Mesopotamia , the Levant , the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa . Those people in Mesopotamia established the Akkadian empire , the Assyrian empire and the Babylonian empire and from the language of the Semite world developed the Hebrew language , the Arab language and the Aramaic etc. In the present day and age genetic studies identified the predominance of the genetic group J1 in the Semites . A recent book by Russian genetic specialist Anatoly Kulosev stated that J1 was found at 81% in the Arabs of Southern Iraq near Ur the Birth place of Abraham the father of the Arabs and the Jews and 43 % for the rest of the Arabs of Iraq . It was also carried by people of other Arab countries and Jews of the Mid- East to a lesser but significant percentages , the next highest percentage in the Arab world was found in the Arabs of Yemen at 73% .

            "answer_text": "No. The majority of Iraqi Arabs are descendants of Arabs as are the majority of Levantine Arabs. Some may have been Arabised and their ancestors were something else, but the majority can actually trace their roots to genuine Arab tribes. Saying this is making the assumption that Arabs only moved to Iraq after Islam, when in fact they have been there since before Christianity. By the time Islam came, the majority of the population in Iraq was already Arab and the lingua franca was already Arabic for centuries. The official languages were different at different times (Persian, Greek, Aramaic\u2026etc.) but the population spoke mostly Arabic and descended from genuine Arab tribes. After Islam, more Arabs migrated to Iraq. Turning the already small minorities of other people to even smaller minorities. Not that it matters when the Arabs migrated because if they migrated 2500 years ago (before Islam), 1400 years ago (with Islam), or 750 years ago (after the fall of Baghdad), that doesn\u2019t make them any less Iraqi because when you can trace your ancestors to a place that far back then you pretty much don\u2019t belong anywhere else! As for those claiming the so called \u201cgenetic studies\u201d, I dare them to prove that any study was done accurately, comprehensively, or even scientifically enough to make such a claim! Seriously, do actually think that there is a DNA bank in Iraq? And if there was one (there isn\u2019t), do you seriously think that it would be free from political tampering (nothing else is free, so why not such a politically important thing)? Also, in the last two decades a lot of displacement and relocation happened, the population in Iraq post 2003 differs quite significantly than that of pre 2003. ",
