            "answer_text": "I think the majority would pick Tyson Fury. He is the best pure boxer in the heavies as of today. I pick him. We watched one of the great come backs of any generation when he decided to try and get his life together. Few people could have done what he has done in the last 2 years. And I think he's better today than vs Klitschko. No he's not the best of all time by a long shot but vs today's field he brings the best game into the ring. He beat Wilder on points but was hit with a draw due to the knockdowns. But I don't see any other heavyweight today getting up from the second knockdown. He has recoperative powers which remind me of that old movie (RoboCop). They turned it off and when it awoke it was startling. So he does everything better than the rest except his power isn't what others have. But it's adequate. I am sort of dismayed that with his leverage he doesn't hit harder. Joshua has the fundamentals down but doesn't have the movement or outside game he needs. Ortiz is a southpaw with great knowledge of boxing with a big punch. That makes him formidable all of the time. His age and the scurge of the heavyweights (PEDS) are his big problems. Wilder hits the hardest easily but despite great athletism he simply can't box like the rest to put it mildly. Ruiz is constantly having to be the giant killer as his height and reach force him to come to opponents. But of course he has the weight issue down. Today's top heavies come into battle from 212lbs and up. I don't put Povetkin or Pulev in the same boat with Ruiz, Fury, Joshua, Wilder and Ortiz. There are plenty of good fights to be made but we rarely see the heavies fighting the fights we want. Wilder vs Fury was the best. Of course Ruiz vs Joshua was too, but this fight actually happened by mistake lol. So we do have different heavies with different styles. This keeps the division interesting. Tyson Fury is the best boxer today. ",

            "answer_text": "Going by championship titles, Tyson Fury holds the WBA, WBO, IBO and the Ring Magazine heavyweight titles and is the lineal and legitimate heavyweight champion. Other titles - WBC and IBF titles are held by Deantoy Wilder and Anthony Joshua respectively. The heavyweight division is set for exciting times with the likes of the rematch between the hungry and revenge seeking former champ Wladimir and the cocky Brit Tyson Fury who beat Wladimir by a unified decision to end Wladimir\u2019s long title reign. If the undefeated Brit - Tyson Fury manages to power past the old guard of Wladimir once again, then an interesting match up with another undefeated fighter in the American Deontay Wilder or fellow Brit Anthony Joshua is likely to draw huge crowds. However, Anthony Joshua is relatively inexperienced compared to Tyson Fury and might bid his time waiting for his career to reach the peak and Deontay is yet to face a huge name in the division despite his 100% winning rate and impressive K.O record. It is worthy to note that Alexander Povetkin is also in the frame for a title shot and his only loss came against the much taller Wladimir. ",
