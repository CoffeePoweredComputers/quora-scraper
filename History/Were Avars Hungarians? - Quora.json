            "answer_text": "This is a very old question, and we do not have a full picture yet. Let\u2019s group the pro and contra facts, starting with the debunking ones: It is widely accepted, that Avars arrived in Eastern and Central Europa around 568AD and no Hungarian chronicle mention a Hungarian conquest/migration into the Carpathian Basin near to this period.The remained minimal Avar vocabulary (personal names and ranks) do not show resemblance with the Hungarian language, these are rather Altaic ones (Baj\u00e1n = mighty, rich, Khagan/khan = ruler, bokolavra = Turkic b\u00f6k\u00fcler (~shaman), tudun = governor, procurator)When Hungarian ambassadors visited the Byzantine Empire in the 10th century, they did not mention any Avars when they spoke about their ancestors, they spoke about \u201csaphartoi asfaloi\u201d (giving a puzzle to the scholars even today)The Hungarian chronicles did not preserve the memories of any person/event from the Avar eraThe anthropology identified the Avar elite as a Mongoliod group, meanwhile, Hungarian conquerors were dominantly Caucosioids (incl Uralic and Turanid subgroups), see the face of a reconstructed Hungarian conqueror lady based on the skulls found in NE Hungary (Karos): Reconstructed face of an Avar elite warrior found in Central Hungary (Kunb\u00e1bony)  It is assumed that core Avars arrived from what is Mongolia and northern China today (Rouran Khaganate - Wikipedia), nobody assumes Hungarians in this region in the 1st millennium AD.Fresh archaeogenetic surveys concluded that the Avar elite of the Carpathian Basin had dominantly inner Asian origin, meanwhile, Hungarians had a dominantly European originThe genetic distance between the Avar elite (marked with a red star on the right side) and the Hungarian population of the Middle ages (yellow square in the middle) is huge, for example, medieval Hungarian sample is much closer to medieval Bavarian samples (source: https://indo-european.eu/2018/09/mitogenomes-from-avar-nomadic-elite-show-inner-asian-origin/) If everything is so clear why many scholars assume a link between Avars and Hungarians after all? Let\u2019s see these arguments: Some Western European sources identified the two groups: Avas, who are called Hungarians ( \"Avares qui dicuntur Ungros\")Uar, Avar, Ugor, Obor, Ogur, Uygur: very similar names used by Eastern sources and it is not always clear, which ethnicity is hidden behind the actual name, even Hungarian can be derived from On-ogur, meaning 10 ogur tribesA detailed analysis of the skeletons of the Avar era showed that only 2% of them was Mongoloid, it means, huge non-Mongolid masses lived in the Carpathian Basin who were not part of the Avar elite, more details: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 P\u00e1l's answer to What was the ethnic/tribal makeup of the Avar Khaganate?Archeology identified many immigration waves in the Carpathian Basin in the Avar era, the newcomers were not part of the core Avars, and their findings show sometimes strong resemblance with Hungarian findings. A part of such groups had the same name in external sources (Onogurs) as HungariansWe can see a population boom in the Carpathian Basin of the Avar era it can be explained by mass immigrationIt can be true that we do not have findings of the Hungarian language in the Carpathian Basin, but this is true for the Slavic language as well, despite this fact it is widely accepted that Slavs already lived in the Carpathian basin in this era.The majority of early Hungarian personal and tribal names can not be derived from the Hungarian language they have Altaic or unknown origins, thus, it is pretty possible that Hungarians used Altaic (prestige) names in the Avar period as wellWithout assuming the Hungarian speaking population in the Carpathian basin it is complicated to explain, why Bulgar conquerors lost their language, and why Hungarian ones preserved it, see: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 P\u00e1l's answer to What are the greatest mysteries in Hungarian history? L\u00e1szl\u00f3 P\u00e1l's answer to How were Bulgarians Slavicized but Hungarians weren't?Some Hungarian chronicles put the arrival of Hungarians in the Carpathian Basin for 677\u2013700AD, thus, in the middle of the Avar eraThe Treasure of Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s - Wikipedia probably hidden in the Avar era, contains an illustration depicting a scene of the divine Garuda bird lifting up a human body. Some claim to be similar to one in the \u00c1lmos legend from the Hungarian mythology: Emese's dream of the Turul bird. see: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 P\u00e1l's answer to How come the Hungarians and the Turks have the same myth of Turul/Tu\u011frul, a falcon-like mythological bird of prey? The script on some findings shows a resemblance to the Hungarian-Szekler script, there are attempts to decipher using this script and the Hungarian language http://real.mtak.hu/18448/1/HosszuZelliger14-2.pdfConclusion? It is up to you. I think, core Avars were probably not Hungarians, they did not speak Hungarian, but is it quite possible, that Hungarian speaking groups lived in the Carpathian Basin already in the Avar era. ",

            "answer_text": "The Avars were an alliance of Inner Asian tribes who appeared in Europe in the mid-6th century. Their westward migration was triggered by the emergence of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khaganate, the first recorded Turk state in history. Some 5th-century Chinese sources mention the Avars as mounted warriors who formed the military elite of the Ruanruan (Rouran) Empire, a steppe empire encompassing present-day Mongolia and northern China from the mid-4th century until its destruction by the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in the mid-6th century. There is a possibility that the Avars were related to Attila\u2019s Huns. Some sources mention that the two leading tribes of the confederation were the uars (who gave the name to the confederation ) and the chunni. For a long time, it was \u201ccostumary\u201d to consider the mounted warriors of the Great Migration Period to be Turkic-speaking, but recent scientific results have largely changed this viewpoint.  (Facial reconstruction of a 6th-century Avar warrior) After leaving the Inner Asian region, the Avars successfully subjugated many Onogur-Bulgar and Slavic tribes that lived north of the Black Sea at the time. Then they formed an alliance with the Lombards, an Eastern Germanic tribe, against the Gepids, another Eastern Germanic tribe who had ruled the Carpathian Basin since the death of Attila (453). The joint Avar-Lombard forces crushed the Gepid army, and the Pannonian Plain became the centre of the new Avar state. The Lombars fled to northern Italy and set up their own kingdom there. The Avars ruled over a vast territory spanning from present-day Austria in the west to the northern shore of the Black Sea in the east. Their invasion against Constantinople in 626 largely faciliated the Slavic migration to the Balkans. Eventually, it took a combined effort from Charlemagne\u2019 Frankish Empire and the First Bulgarian Empire to destroy the Avar state in the early 9th century. The subsequent fate of the Avars is unknown, no written sources mention them after the 830s.  (Facial reconstruction of another 6th-century Avar warrior, from a grave near the Tisa river in present-day Hungary) Regarding the Avar-Magyar connection: there is no proof of a close linguistic or genetic relationship between the Avars and the Magyars. Reconstucted faces of 10-th century Hungarian warriors do not show strong Asian characteristics. The two were culturally quite similar since both came from the Eurasian steppe. A theory first formulated by prominent Hungarian historian Gyula L\u00e1szl\u00f3 (1910\u20131998) claims that the Hungarian tribes (who conquered the Pannonian Basin in the late 9th-century) were an alliance of (Oghur) Turk and Caucasian tribes, while the Avars were Uralic-speaking people. This theory was labelled as \u201cunscientific\u201d by most scholars. However, recent archeogenetic studies revived this debate. A genetic study published in Scientific Reports in November 2019 examined the remains of fourteen individuals buried at various elite Avar cemeteries in the Pannonian Basin and came to the conclusion that the Avar males carried mainly the paternal haplogroup N which is thought to have been originated in northern China and is associated with the spread of the Uralic languages. On the other hand, this paternal haplogroup was basically absent among 10th-century Hungarian warriors (for instance, the members of the ruling \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty belonged to common West Eurasian paternal haplogroups such as R1a and R1b). Since there is no clear connection between genetics and language (e.g. most Hungarians do not carry paternal haplogroup N, but speak a Uralic language), these results can\u2019t decide the debate.
