            "answer_text": "You talking III? George, I've heard, was a good King. But, he saw the uprising in the colonies in the Americas as an affront to his rule, ordained by God and all. And he was a bad politician. So . . . He denied the colonials requests. They wanted representation. He said, \u201cThey aren't going to tell their king what to do!\u201d Bad move, politically. If he'd said, \u201cFuck 'em. Sure, give 'em six.\u201d Well, then what? Six or seven or 13 colonial representatives in the House of Commons wasn't going to change much, if anything regarding colonial rule. And then he would have undercut the popular support for independence. America would have to wait, like Canada, for its sovereign rule. ",

            "answer_text": "A good result an victory against his enemies. He probably viewed it as a tiny part of a massive ongoing global war between Britain one one side ( cos he was British he would view everything as such ) and a succession of enemies lead primarily by the French Empire and Spanish Empire. The time zone of the Revolution the enemies consisted of the French Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Dutch Empire, the Maratha Empire, the Kingdom of Mysore, thirteen disaffected colonies (plus unrest at home and abroad in the other colonies ). Then the league of armed neutrality who demanded to be able to trade with the main enemies which consisted of the Russian Empire, the Prussian Empire, the Swedish Empire, The Danish-Norwegian Empire, the Portuguese Empire, the Kingdom of the Two Sicillies ( lots of central med ). So the little bit of getting thirteen colonies to remain English speaking trading partners whilst bankrupting France and Italy destroying the Dutch Empire was probably viewed as an overall success. How did the US feel about losing the US Colony Philippines at the end of the Second World war? or do most people outside of the Philippines not realise it happened? edit The French Empire and Spanish Empire viewed the Thirteen Colonies start of peace with the British June 1781 negotiations before the Battle of Yorktown late 1781 as treachery. Also in League of armed neutrality Ottoman Empire , Holy Roman Empire and Moroccan Fleet were defending Colonial shipping.  This is not my image I copied this image from wiki but you can see just who would benefit most from the British destruction of the Spanish Empire. Plus who would also benefit from an extension of an English speaking trade world . ",
