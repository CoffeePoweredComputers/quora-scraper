            "answer_text": "Re: \u201cAre there any motivations that can bind groups together better than a common enemy?\u201d If humans became such a powerful species on this beautiful blue planet, by being cooperative, and if we are destroying life on the planet by being competitive, then maybe \u2018a common enemy\u2019 in the question could be replaced with \u2018a common cause\u2019 instead. Sorry, but I am a physical system Science type who dabbles in both Philosophy and the spirituality component of both Religion and Philosophy. To make it worse, I am also a guided writer who hears (and sometimes follows) voices, writing in that arena as Jesuis Laplume (short for \u2018I am The pen\u2019 using French words). While society presently uses Fear-based competition (we are not enough, so we must get and keep more than our fair share), there is a more positive and more positively-impactful approach. Study of how this universe appears to have come about, and even playing with concepts about what had to be available before The Big Bang like processes, indicates that there is no possibility of life (and later such as humans) could ever have come about by simple, unguided random chance. Some have done bad Science and worse mathematics (in the probability arena) to disseminate that nonsense that this is a random universe and we are purposeless accident within it. The Decimal orders of magnitude against that being true are measured in trillions of trillions against that happening within the estimated age of this universe of about 14 billion years. The only way that life could have happened a few billion years back, and our coming into being a fraction of a billion years ago, was that the chosen options, among the possible ones at any selection point, were done so that life would appear; then such as humans. We humans would not be successful, as a species, if we were usually ruled only by those who chose competition over cooperation. We are here and we are successful as a species (even too successful and too numerous) but there is a possibility that we can be motivated by Love-focused ways rather than Fear-based ones like competition and fighting a common enemy. Living in cooperation, and driven by Love-based processes, could have us bind together way better than treating any as an enemy! Not only that, but it is happening and driving those who are still trying to stay safe using Fear-based ways mad; in a mentally-unbalanced ways. \u2018The Trumpet who makes a terrible noise\u2019 makes that obvious to many thinking humans. Logically you cannot make Peace using War as you major tool! ",

            "answer_text": "You have asked a great question. From my perspective, what can bind a group is, actually, self-interest, but it is not the self-interest, as conceptualized in today\u2019s society. In my opinion, it is in each individuals self interest, to first, look towards and take care of others, before they take care of themselves. Since others, have a wider and outside perspective of each other, they are better able to judge your physical, emotion, and spiritual needs, with the other individual\u2019s input, of course. So, a person who is selfish, only takes care of themselves, and may see, others as opportunities or tools, to exploit to their own advantage. But this hinders true meaningful connections and an opportunity to receive information, about yourself from others, and take that information and learn from it. So, what should bind us together, is not a common enemy, but a common, friend, since instead of focusing on competition, destruction and fighting, the group can focus on taking care of each other, to the best of their ability. And cooperation, since it increase the knowledge base and ability to solve problems, seems to be an efficient way for society to prosper, since everyone is sharing everything they know, instead of keeping it to themselves, due to selfish motivations.

            "answer_text": "The meaning of life is - To Learn. Understanding morality is no kind of social & psychological construct is crucial. It is an outgrowth of our biological capacity for empathy. Out of which Love also emerges that we exercise, because we are also intrinsically social creatures. Everything important in the most practical terms, always attempting to express itself in sublime ways is mostly composed of Love - Integrity, dedication, authentic sincerity, honesty (especially with oneself), courage, honour etc. & must be a component of everything done or its worthless. Empathy is a biological instinct so much bigger than any one of us. It's there for the perpetuation of the species. We would neither procreate w/o it or nearly as often or have any meaningful intimacy with virtually anyone - or stick around to raise the offspring. This is why emotional intelligence & empathy are just a form of this & the inevitable reason why it is the best predictor of all levels of the most profound happiness, fulfillment, success & prosperity in life.
