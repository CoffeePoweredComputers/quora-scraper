            "answer_text": "Ever is a long time! So almost certainly, yes. Jeff Bezos himself just a couple of weeks ago said \"Amazon is not too big to fail \u2026 In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.\" So that is the founder and CEO himself predicting that Amazon will go out of business eventually. Will it be replaced by a \u201cbetter\u201d alternative? What is better? More products, faster shipping, lower prices, better service? Probably, yes, as the absolute trend in business since recorded history has been toward more variety, quality, cheaper, faster, and better service. ",
