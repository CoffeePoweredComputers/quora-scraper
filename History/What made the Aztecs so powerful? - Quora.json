            "answer_text": "If the Romans had an equal, it would have been the Aztecs in Mexico. However, if it weren't for the Spanish Conquistadors, the Aztecs could possibly have expanded further into North and South America easily. Why? For two very crucial reasons! Warrior society and a hegemonic/informal empire.  \u200bHegemonic Empire (governance)Interestingly, the Aztecs are not a single ethnic group but a conglomeration of as many as 17 ethnic groups! In the beginnning, there existed one city- Tenochtitlan (later to become Mexico City)- built by the Mexica people. They then formed an alliance with two other cities -Texcoco (Tetzcoco) and Tlacopan (these three cities are shown as yellow dots in the map above). This Triple Alliance was to rule the Valley of Mexico and gradually expanded by conquering other cities. As such, it was a nation of city states much like Venice and other nations.  One interesting fact is that not every city was defeated and thus there existed \"holes\" in the empire. But this somehow didn't really bother the Aztecs. Like the Zergs in Starcraft, they assimilated their populations and made them part of the nation. However, in an smart play, the Aztecs made sure that the conquered cities were ruled by their local governments and they were only required to pay tribute. But of course they couldn't trust all of them so that also built forts to watch over the more rebellious ones. But how did they defeat their enemies so easily? Warrior Society  \u200bAztec warriors as depicted in the Codex Mendoza Much like the Romans, they were at the top of their food chain (figuratively speaking) as their warriors were strong enough to defeat other cities. However, this is where Rome failed and the Aztecs benefited. The latter trained every male in combat since birth and fighting was in their blood. This is unlike the Roman's expensive but effective professional army. Warriors were essential to Aztec life and culture. At birth an Aztec boy would receive two symbols of being a warrior. A shield would be placed in his left hand, and an arrow would be placed in his right. After a short ceremony the newly born boy's umbilical cord, shield, and arrow would be taken to a battlefield to be buried by a renowned warrior. These parts would symbol the rise of a warrior. Each shield and arrow would be made specifically for that boy, and would resemble his family and the gods. These birth rituals show the importance of warrior culture to the Aztecs. When formal training in handling weapons began at age fifteen, youth would begin to accompany the seasoned warriors on campaigns so that they could become accustomed to military life and lose fear of battle. At age twenty, those who wanted to become warriors officially went to war. The parents of the youth sought out veteran warriors, bringing them foods and gifts with the objective of securing a warrior to be the sponsor of their child. Ideally, the sponsor would watch over the youth and teach him how to take captives. However, the degree to which the warrior looked after and helped the noble\u2019s child depended greatly on the amount of payment received from the parents. Thus, sons of high nobility tended to succeed more often in war than those of lower nobility.  \u200b\u200bA page from the Codex Mendoza depicting an Aztec warrior priest and Aztec priest rising through the ranks of their orders Fighting and capturing enemies were the main way to rise up the social ladder. The warrior's life was a chance to change one's social status. If they were successful as a warrior they would be presented with gifts and recognized publicly for their accomplishments in battle. If they reached the rank of Eagle or Jaguar warrior they would be considered as nobles. They would also become full-time warriors working for the city-state to protect merchants and the city itself. They resembled the police force of Aztec society. Full time job with the best retirement benefits if you even lived that long. Human Sacrifice (Bonus answer)  Someone in the comments asked me to explain the significance of human sacrifice in the Aztec culture. Just like almost any religious act (Crusades, Jihads, etc), it got hijacked by the Aztec leaders in their politics. A common misconception is that human sacrifice was the bloodthirsty and ruthless method of keeping the people in line. In reality, the Aztecs people actually LIKED the human sacrifices as it was in keeping with their beliefs that their deities would then be satsified and calamity would not befall the people. The Aztec leaders also resorted to a form of ritual warfare, the Flower War, to obtain living human bodies for the sacrifices in time of peace (war would bring more than enough captives). This claim however has been severely criticised by scholars such as Ross Hassig and Nigel Davies who claim that the main purpose of the Flower Wars was political and not religious and that the number of sacrificial victims obtained through flower wars was insignificant compared to the number of victims obtained through normal political warfare. The high-profile nature of the sacrificial ceremonies indicates that human sacrifice played an important political function. The Mexica used a sophisticated package of psychological weaponry to maintain their empire, aimed at instilling a sense of fear into their neighbours. The Aztecs controlled a large empire of tribute-paying vassal tribes. The population of native Aztecs was very small compared to the population of the area they controlled. The Aztecs were vulnerable: they would have been outnumbered had their vassal tribes formed alliances and rebelled. To sow dissension among the vassals the Aztecs demanded human victims as part of the annual tribute. The vassals would raid each other to capture prisoners. This encouraged animosity between the vassals and strengthened Aztec political rule. This was a method of political control which was innovative and perhaps unique in human history. Because the objective of Aztec warfare was to capture victims alive for human sacrifice, battle tactics were designed primarily to injure the enemy rather than kill him. After towns were conquered their inhabitants were no longer candidates for human sacrifice, only liable to regular tribute. Slaves also could be used for human sacrifice, but only if the slave was considered lazy and had been resold three times. ",

            "answer_text": "::What made the Aztecs so powerful? Did they have access to mines or agricultural areas no one else did?  Did they possess technology no one else did?  Circa 1500.:: What is today central Mexico was once covered by a lacustrine system known as Anahuac (close to the water). The system was formed by the Chalco, Xochimilco, Texcoco, Xaltocan and Zumpango lakes, connected by channels among the lowlands and marshy areas. Before the arrival of the Mexica (aka the Aztecs), Anahuac was divided in a multitude of petty kingdoms and ethnics enclaves: Tetzcuco, Chalca, Colhuacan, Cuauhtitlan, Tlapacoya, Azcapotzalco, Copilco, Cuicuilco... These polities were weak but rather advanced, as cultural (and some of them ethnic) inheritors of the Toltec State, and influenced by the Olmec, Maya and Zapotec cultures. In 1215, a groups of peoples coming from the north, the Mexica,  started to infiltrate the Anahuac Valley. To survive, they hired themselves as mercenaries, eager to fight for whoever needed some extra muscle in the never-ending skirmishes among neighbors. After being evicted by their last employer, the Lord of Culhuacan, they decide to settle down in an islet in the Texcoco lake, in 1370, and founded the city of Tenochtitlan. Initially under the protection of the Lord of  Azcapotzalco, in 1434 they joined forces with the Lords of Tetzcoco and Tlacopan and defeated Azcapotzalco. Together, this Triple Alliance conquered the smaller, weaker polities in Anahuac one by one (with the notable exception of Tlaxcallan) and by the middle of the XV century were already pushing their boundaries beyond the Valley, towards today Michoacan and Chiapas. To (finally!) answer the question: the Mexica who established Tenochtitlan transformed themselves from a band of marauders and mercenaries into the hegemonic mesoamerican power, in less than three hundred years, thanks to:  the division among the originary peoples in Anahuac, which allowed the Mexica to impose themselves over these weaker but more advanced peoples,who had developed quite sofisticated hydraulic and agricultural technologies, which allowed an economy strong enought to feed and equip the Alliance Army,which was religiously inspired to expand, conquer and subdue their neighbors And you have an unified Mexica state powerful beyond anything done by the previous, smaller states.
