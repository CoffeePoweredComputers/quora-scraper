Not equal among you are those who spent (freely) and fought, before the Victory, (with those who did so later). Those are higher in rank than those who spent (freely) and fought afterwards. But TO ALL HAS ALLAH PROMISED A GOODLY (reward). And Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.\" [57:10] So they have ranks but ALL of them are Jannati.

He (Sahnon) said: If they say (any of them) did Kufr or deviated, then he will be killed, or if he say (they are not deviants but) criticize them like lay people then he should be punished severely. [Utba quoted in his book al Mustakhraj, Usul as-Sunnah by Ibn abi Zamneen page 309, Ibn Rushd quoted in his Sharah of \"al Mustakhraj\" by al Utba 16/420, the name of sharah is \"Byan at-Tahseel wal Sharah wal Taujeeh wat-Ta`teel li Masail al Mustakhraj\", Qadhi Iyaad considered it the opinion of Imam Malik in ash-Shifa 2/600] Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah may Allaah have mercy upon him summed up the approach of Ahlus-Sunnah with the following precious words: \u201cThey refrain from delving into the disputes that occurred between the Companions and say, 'These narrations that have been reported concerning their faults have in them some that are false, some that have had things added to them, some that have had parts omitted from them, and the original indication of some has been altered. As for those narrations that are authentic (concerning their faults), then they (the Companions) are excused (and forgiven) \u2013 they practiced ijtihaad (personal reasoning) and were either correct or wrong. Furthermore, they do not believe that each of the Companions is infallible and free from committing major or minor sins. Rather, they may commit sins in general, however, they possess from precedence and virtues that which necessitates that they be forgiven for whatever (sins) they commit \u2013 if they did commit any. This is even to the point that they will be forgiven for evil deeds the likes of which those who come after them will not be forgiven for. This is because they possess good deeds that wipe out the evil deeds, the likes of which will not be for those after them.' It is established that the Prophet, sallallaahu \u02bbalayhi wa sallam, stated that they are the best of generations and that if one of them were to give a mudd (handful) of gold in charity, it would be better than if someone who came after them were to give the whole of Mount Uhud in gold. And if it was the case that one of them committed a sin, then either he repented from it, performed some good deed that wiped it out, or he will be forgiven for it due to the virtue of his precedence or because of the intercession of Muhammad, sallallaahu \u02bbalayhi wa sallam, of which the Companions are more deserving. Perhaps he was tested by some affliction in this worldly life, by which it was expiated from him. So if this is with respect to the sins that were actualized (by them), then what about the matters in which they did ijtihaad? If they were correct, then they will have two rewards, and if they were incorrect, then they will have just one reward and their error will be forgiven. Furthermore, the few bad deeds committed by some of them are slight in comparison to their virtues and good qualities, such as their belief in Allaah and His Messenger, their jihaad for His Cause, their migration, their support (of the Religion), as well as their beneficial knowledge and good deeds.\u201d [Al-'Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah, taken from Islamweb Fatwa No : 308251] Proof 1: Prophet prayed to protect Muawiyah from the Punishment\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0645\u0633\u0647\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0639\u0646 \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0628\u0646 \u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u0639\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0639\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0629 - \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0635\u062d\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u064a \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 - \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u064a - \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 - \u0642\u0627\u0644 : ( \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0628 \u0648\u0642\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0630\u0627\u0628 ) .

Umar bin Abdul Wahid and al Waleed bin Muslim narrated from Saeed from Rabe`a from narrated from Ibi Idrees who heard from Abdul Rahman bin Abi Umairah. THIS CHAIN IS POWERFUL. Tirmidhee narrated other than Abi Idrees, Ibn al Jawzi with the rout of Ismaeel bin Muhammad who heard Abbas bin Muhammad from Abu Mas`har. Darqutni said: Ismaeel bin Muhammad is a liar. (ad-Dahabee replied) This is another misunderstanding, this Ismaeel (bin Muhammad) is as-Saffaar who is trustworthy, and the one to whom ad-Darqutni said, a liar, he is (Ismaeel bin Muhammad) al Muzni.
