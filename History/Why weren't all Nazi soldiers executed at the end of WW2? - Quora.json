            "answer_text": "Because not all of them were responsible for war crimes, although they were in criminal organizations which was established at the Nuremberg Trials. For example, the 15th Waffen SS Grenadier Division and the 19th Waffen SS Grenadier Division.  15th Waffen SS Grenadier Division Both of these divisions were not really punished. They never committed any war crimes or committed crimes against humanity. They were simply fighting the Soviets on the Eastern Front and were protecting the country of Latvia. They were just soldiers doing their duty in the war for their country, and they couldn\u2019t be legally charged in the Nuremberg Trials for\u2026 again\u2026 fighting for their country and carrying out their duties. In 1945, the Americans were capturing many German POW\u2019s. All branches within the SS\u2026  The SS Were required to have a tattoo under their left arms.  It was only a tattoo of their blood type. The allies would have soldiers walk shirtless with their arms up, so the Americans can see the tattoo, separate the soldiers, and arrest them. The problem was, not all soldiers had these tattoos. For example, Josef Mengele. Who was one of the cruelest SS service members known.  Josef Mengele And since the Nazis famously destroyed a lot of orders and evidence that can be used against them, sometimes it was hard to tell who was in the SS and who was responsible for any war crimes. Some SS personnel tried running away wearing Wehrmacht uniforms, because they knew the Wehrmacht would just get a slap on the hand most likely. It wasn\u2019t until later when we realized the Wehrmacht was also responsible for war crimes and some units supported the Einsatzgruppen during Operation Barbarossa. Those who were known to work in death camps, ghettos, and labor camps, whether they were just guards or book keepers, would be sentenced to prison during the Nuremberg Trials. Senior SS staff would get heftier punishments, depending on their roles in the camps and ghettos. The problem was that, not everyone was able to get identified as SS. Some lied about not being SS, changed their names, and did not have tattoos. Their SS orders were destroyed so there was no proof of their role in the war crimes committed. All SS personnel were to be punished, regardless of their roles. However; it was found out that from 1943\u20131945, some were drafted into the SS and had no choice but to enlist into the SS, or them and their families would suffer. So all personnel who enlisted from 1943 and after, would get pension because drafting came into play. During and after the Nuremberg Trials, people joined Nazi Hunters groups and would look for any people who were involved. Like Adolph Eichmann who was known as the \u201cArchitect of the Holocaust.\u201d So to answer your question, no everyone was a Nazi. And some evidence like documents proving they were SS were gone, names were changed, and some \u201cNazis\u201d simply vanished. ",

            "answer_text": "It was hardly their fault that the war happened. In fact, I have known and spoken to a few. The average German soldier fought because they were drafted or because they felt the need to defend their community. They were pawns. Most of them were late teens or early 20s. These are not men who were evil and hateful. They merely fought for the wrong side, and being on the wrong side of a war is not, in and of itself, grounds for punishment. Now, this is referring to the rank and file German military, of course, not the concentration camp guards, the leadership or the SS. That is much different, and many of them were punished. But ask yourself this: What would you have done? You are in a village in Germany. All you know is what you are told by the media. You hear that your country is fighting for its survival. The Americans and British are bombing targets in your area and the Soviets are approaching from the East. You are told you are required to join the army to defend your homeland. You probably would. In fact, you would have little option but to do so. If we had executed all the soldiers, we would have decimated Germany and the Germans who survived surely would never have forgiven us. We needed Germans to help as allies in the Cold War. Not only that, but how could you execute them all and not expect them to fight back? If we were to do so, they would never have surrendered. I feel strongly that the average German soldier was not at fault and did not deserve such punishment. From those I talked to, there was much regret, for the rest of their lives, for fighting for the side that engaged in genocide and conquest. I know some saw the reports of the Holocaust at the end of the war and could not accept that such things could have happened, in their own country, for years thereafter, telling themselves that it must all be lies. I have even known members of the Nazi party who joined it simply because it was a tacit requirement for officers and they felt like it would advance their careers. But all those I have met expressed dismay and regret over what happened. Most Germans were not bad people. We need to have some empathy here. ",
