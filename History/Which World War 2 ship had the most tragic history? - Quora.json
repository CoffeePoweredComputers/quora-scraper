            "answer_text": "Plenty of candidates out there, but mine would be the destruction of the USS Juneau.  Juneau was an Atlanta-class light antiaircraft cruiser (CLAA) specifically designed as an antiaircraft escort for carrier battlegroups. She carried 16 dual-purpose 5\u2033 guns, numerous smaller AA guns, and even a complement of Mk-15 torpedoes (the only American cruiser class to carry torpedoes, as opposed to most other navies). She was very lightly armored, however, and was never meant to operate in a major ship-to-ship surface battle, but that\u2019s what she found herself in on the night of Friday the 13th, November 1942, the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Up until that time Juneau had served her intended function well, particularly during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, where her guns in concert with others likely saved the carrier USS Enterprise from destruction at the hands of Japanese dive and torpedo bombers. This night she was to be used to help stop a Japanese bombardment force consisting of battleships whose purpose was to put the critical Henderson Field out of action so the Japanese could land a major reinforcement and supply convoy without fear of air attack. In this role Juneau could be compared to an extra-heavy destroyer - bristling with small guns that could hurt smaller ships, but couldn\u2019t penetrate battleship armor. At any rate, despite radar showing the movements of the Japanese task force, commander Admiral Callaghan failed to interpret his tactical info properly and ended up blundering head-on into the middle of the Japanese task force, with both sided opening fire in the dark at whatever presented itself, sometimes friendly ships. Juneau\u2019s guns lashed out at a destroyer, probably hitting her several times, but was herself hit a number of times and took a torpedo hit forward that caused flooding and did severe damage to her keel and propulsion, limiting her to only about ten knots or so, and forcing her retirement from the battle. The next morning Juneau was traveling with a handful of other damaged ships from the battle to the rear base of Espirito Santo for temporary repairs when the ships were spotted by a Japanese submarine, which fired two torpedoes intended for the battered cruiser USS San Francisco. They missed the heavy cruiser, but one hit Juneau in almost the exact same spot she had been hit the night before. Juneau immediately disappeared in a massive explosion, showering the other ships with her debris, and catapulting almost 100 men in the water, many severely injured and dying. The acting commander of what was left of the force, Captain Gilbert Hoover of the cruiser USS Helena, fearing more submarine attacks, elected to pass word on to a patrol plane about Juneau\u2019s loss and possible survivors rather than conduct a rescue himself, and sailed away, a controversial move that eventually got him removed from command and beached. Unfortunately, the patrol plane\u2019s message never made it up the chain of command, and word did not reach anyone for eight days that there were survivors in the water until almost all of them had died from exposure, dehydration, or sharks. Eventually ten men were rescued, out of a complement of almost 700, one of the highest death tolls of any US Navy ship during wartime, exceeded only by the Arizona, the Indianapolis, and the Franklin. It should also be noted that Juneau carried the five Sullivan brothers, all of whom went down with their ship (one of them may have lingered in the water before succumbing), and forced changes in military policy about assigning family members to the same ship or combat units. They also had a new destroyer named after them that served in the latter part of the Pacific War, the USS The Sullivans.  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d nominate three ships, all connected. HMS Hood is the first that comes to mind. The largest warship in the world for 20 years and the symbol of British naval power, she toured the world from Japan to the United States. Everyone in the Royal Navy wanted to serve on her.  When war broke out in 1939 though, Hood was in need of a major refit. Contrary to popular belief her armor was more than adequate protection from the weapons of her contemporaries, she was actually the the best protected warship in the world at the time, but that was 20 years ago and many new warships had since entered service. More importantly her machinery spaces were in dire shape, and she would get multiple smaller refits to keep acceptable speed for a battlecruiser during the first two years of the war. The major overhaul would have to wait, she was too powerful to be put on the sidelines at a time when the Royal Navy lacked ships both fast and powerful. During those two years she was quite active: Conducting multiple sweeps of the North Sea and Bay of Biscay and coming under German air attack. She was the flagship of Force H based in Gibraltar for a period and during that stint played a major role in the attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir.  However, her first (and as it turned out, last) time to meet a major enemy surface vessel in combat came on May 24, 1941 when the Germans sent the battleship Bismarck and escorting heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen to break out into Atlantic for convoy raiding. Hood and the accompanying battleship HMS Prince of Wales had been stationed south of Iceland in anticipation of this, and when the Germans made the final run through the Denmark Strait, a course was set to cut the German ships off; it was Hood\u2019s opportunity to shine. The two German ships were much farther ahead than expected, almost out of the Strait entirely. Admiral Holland commanding the squadron aboard Hood ordered a dash toward the German ships to close the distance as fast as possible, when they entered gunnery range the order came to open fire.  *last picture of the Hood, taken from the Prince of Wales Unfortunately for poor Hood, she mistook the leading Prinz Eugen for Bismarck, wasting several salvos on an 8-inch gun toting cruiser that could at most scratch Hood\u2019s paint, while the real threat of Bismarck was left under the fire of just the Prince of Wales. Bismarck fired repeatedly at Hood until she achieved a straddle, the very next salvo BOOM\u2026.a huge explosion erupted from Hood\u2019s rear deck, apparently one of Bismarck\u2019s shells penetrated the aft magazine. Continuing to jet forward, the ship quickly snapped in half, her bow rising several hundred feet in the air. Sinking in under three minutes, only 3 of her 1,418 crewmen survived.   Prince of Wales was then subject to a torrent of fire, and after being hit repeatedly she withdrew under a smoke screen, though not before hitting Bismarck several times in return. Thus the Allies suffered their only defeat in a battleship engagement during the whole war. That such a proud, beautiful and massive ship as Hood could be despatched so quick and violently was shocking to the British public. The Royal Navy suffered worse blows during the war, but in terms of detriment to national morale, this was unrivaled. Of course the Hood is hardly the only beautiful ship to meet a violent end in WWII. Bismarck herself enjoyed only a temporary victory: just two days later after a spectacular chase she was rendered unmaneuverable by an attack from Carrier-based aircraft. The following day the British home fleet caught up to her. Beautiful though she was, she very rapidly went from looking like this\u2026  \u2026.to this\u2026.   *Bismarck sinking from aboard HMS Dorsetshire. Thus on her first ever sortie Bismarck crossed swords with and destroyed the next largest warship in the world after herself before meeting the same fate, albeit a prolonged beating rather than instant destruction like the Hood. (Why has there not been a movie about this since 1960? Absolutely amazing story, it\u2019s hard to believe it even happened in real life it\u2019s so cinematic, especially the the chase stuff I haven\u2019t talk about.)  Another contender, and my personal favorite, is the other tragic battlecruiser of the WWII Royal Navy, HMS Repulse.  At the onset of war with Japan, poor Repulse was caught in the open without air over off the coast of Malaya by swarms of land-based Japanese aircraft alongside, ironically, Prince of Wales.(which was not so lucky this time around) I won\u2019t delve into how they got into this situation or why they were in the Far East so early to begin with, it\u2019s a long story but worth looking up.  *HMS Repulse in Singapore Harbor. What I find so tragic and kind of beautiful about Repulse\u2019s sinking is just how astonishing she performed in her last moments. Prince of Wales\u2019 fate was sealed early on when she took a crippling torpedo hit to the propulsion spaces, identical to the one that doomed her German nemesis six months earlier. Repulse on the other hand gracefully dodged torpedo after torpedo and dozens of dive bomber attacks for an hour. In total she dodged 19 torpedos and countless bombs, receiving just one nasty bomb hit in return.  However just past noon a coordinated attack of 17 torpedo torpedo bombers coming from all directions caught her in between a spread, and that was curtains for the stubborn Repulse. She was hit 5 times in quick succession, and began to quickly capsize with Prince of Wales still dying not far away. 508 officers and men went down with her.  I may not be a navy man or even a navy brat myself, but as the descendant of a Royal Navy veteran who immigrated to the United States, heard his stories and is extremely well read on naval history, I recognize an exceptional crew when I see it. The crew of Repulse was truly exceptional. May they rest In peace. ",

            "answer_text": "Several spring to mind. Two sister ships, Bismarck and Tirpitz amongst them. The Bismarck packed more into a few days than some ships in a thirty year existence, Destroys the pride and joy of the Royal Navy (HMS Hood) in a manner still argued about to this day. Then the Royal Navy loses contact, then finds her due to an intercepted radio broadcast but plots the position incorrectly and all the ships head in the wrong direction, then a flying boat finds her, the Royal Navy has one chance to stop her but the aircraft attack the wrong ship (one of their own!), but, there\u2019s just enough time for one last attack. The Bismarck twists and turns and the very last torpedo hit in the only place that it would hurt her, it jams the rudder, she can only go round and round in circles. The Royal Navy catches up and pounds her for over two hours, some of the crew jump overboard when the bombardment gets too much. Finally the Bismarck sinks, all colors flying, scuttled or not? Only just over 100 of her 2,200 strong crew survived. Operation Rhein\u00fcbung - Wikipedia Her sister spent most of her career skulking in Norwegian fjords but such was her presence that she helped sink a convoy just by moving berths. The a Royal Navy spent years trying to sink her, midget submarines, air attacks, nothing worked, finally the RAF gets a bomb that can sink her and after several attempts damage the battleship so it is moved closer to the UK. There is enough time for one last attempt before the weather will close in. Due to some mis communication the defending fighters are alerted too late, the smoke pots aren\u2019t working and she lies awaiting her fate. Several Tall Boys dropped by 9 and 617 Squadrons hit the ship, she capsizes and hundreds of her young crew are trapped and die. In nearly 4 years the Tirpitz fired her guns once, at an island, what a waste of a fine ship and her crew. ",

In this matter, for me the history of USS Indianapolis (see USS Indianapolis (CA-35) - Wikipedia) is the most horrible one. In July 1945, Indianapolis completed a top-secret high-speed trip to deliver parts of Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon ever used in combat, to the United States Army Air Force Base on the island of Tinian, and subsequently departed for the Philippines on training duty.  It was sunken like too many other ships in WWII, by Japanese torpedoes. But the torpedoes were just the beginning of the nightmare of the crew, later on devoured in large quantity by sharks! The largest and worst shark attack ever! See The Worst Shark Attack in History. Estimates of the number who died from shark attacks range from a few dozen to almost 150.  See Sergio Diniz's answer to What was the worst mass shark attack in the Atlantic? ",
