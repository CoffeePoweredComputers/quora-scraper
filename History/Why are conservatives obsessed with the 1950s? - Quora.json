            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think conservatives are obsessed with the 1950s. I think a lot of working-class whites look back at the 1950s as a better time for people like them. (Pause here for people to bring up segregation.) No, not the segregation part of the 1950s. They don\u2019t like that part. But they do like other parts of the 1950s culture, like: Plenty of blue-collar jobs that paid enough to support a family.Related to that, single-income homes with a stay-at-home parent.Before you freak out about women being forced to stay at home, I didn\u2019t say that. I said a stay-at-home parent. Many conservatives see the importance of having someone whose job is raising children and making the house run smoothly. Most women I know, from both sides of the political spectrum, would love to be stay-at-home moms. A lot of men would love to be stay-at-home dads, too.Larger families, because they were more affordable. Many people stop after one or two kids now, not because they don\u2019t want more kids, but because they can\u2019t afford any more.Higher church attendance.More locally-owned, small stores. No Wal-Marts.When you look at that list, you may notice that a lot of those things involve stronger families and local communities. That\u2019s what many conservatives really want: a focus on families and local communities, rather than federal-level politics and popular culture. (Think about this: How many Americans spend more time following the lives of celebrities on TV, rather than the lives of their own cousins? That\u2019s one of the problems conservatives see in modern American culture. Something went wrong somewhere along the way, where people know more about the Kardashian family than they know about their own extended family.) ",
