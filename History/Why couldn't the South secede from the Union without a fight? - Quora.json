            "answer_text": "Jim Davis is the only person I see here whose answer separates secession from war, which is the essence of the controversy. Whether the southern states could secede was much debated. Several had seceded even before Lincoln took office, several more seceded afterwards. And Lincoln and his cabinet and Congress all debated whether the southern states could secede, and whether the Confederate States of America was a valid government. We could still be debating this, had the South not begun the Civil War. The issue that created the war was not secession. The issue that created the war was whether military forts, armaments, even soldiers, remained in the Union after the state seceded. Fort Sumter was a Federal fort sitting squarely in the harbor of Charleston South Carolina. Had South Carolina been willing to say, \"Yes; this is a Union Fort; we cannot have it in our own harbor, however. Let us work out a peaceful treaty for the transition of soldiers and guns out of the Fort, and perhaps a payment for having the Union hand us a solidly barricaded and strategically placed military post,\" the war might have been avoided. And who knows what would have happened? There may have been a Confederate States of America for some period of time; slavery may have existed for some longer period of time (although there were other political and economic factors that make the possible outcomes a roll of the dice). But instead, South Carolina chose to insist that Fort Sumter was part of the territory of their state, and of the Confederacy. And when the Union took steps to retain the Fort, the South fired on it. This was the cause of the Civil War. This is not to say that there would not have been some other cause of the Civil War, or some other battle that would have been as crucial a nexus. In any \"alternate world\" history, there can be a dozen different tipping points to the actions that follow. But in this case, the firing on Fort Sumter by the Confederates at Charleston was the factual cause of the war. So the answer to your question is that it may have been permissible for southern states to leave the Union; however, those southern states insisted on starting battle before that question was resolved.

            "answer_text": "On the Union side, the question is simple; if part of your country is allowed to break away from the rest simply because it doesn\u2019t like how an election came out, pretty soon you don\u2019t HAVE a country anymore. The principle of unilateral secession had to be quashed at all costs. Despite this, the federal government bent over backwards, despite blatant provocation by Southern military forces, to avoid the onset of open war. Only when Fort Sumter proved that Washington\u2019s authority could no longer be upheld by peaceful means did Lincoln call for troops to suppress the rebellion. On the Southern side- and it is vital to remember that THE SOUTH STARTED THE WAR, firing the first shots as early as January 1861- there were multiple reasons to resort to violence. First and foremost was the reason Jefferson Davis, elected president of the Confederate States two months prior, gave the order on April 9 for the reduction of Fort Sumter: a nation must demonstrate that it is able to defend the territory it claims. Confederate claims of independence and nationhood weren\u2019t credible as long as United States forces remained at large and unmolested within the bounds claimed by that government. Allowing Fort Sumter to remain in Union hands was a sign that the rebels were too weak to take it- which would preclude foreign recognition. Second, by starting the war, the Confederacy forced the eight slave states that didn\u2019t immediately secede with Lincoln\u2019s election to choose sides. Two of those states- Arkansas and Virginia- had sent ultimatums to Washington demanding the repudiation of Republican victory in 1860 and ironclad guarantees of slavery rights throughout the nation as conditions for their continued presence within the Union. A third, North Carolina, had rejected secession in February by a vote of only 50 to 49. War would knock these three states (and, as it proved, also Tennessee) off the fence and into the Confederacy, vastly increasing its economic and military potential and making it better able to defend itself. Finally, there was a small but disproportionately powerful faction within the Confederacy that believed the Union would crumble under the force of war, and that Southern forces could basically conquer the North and reconstruct the Union on its own (pro-slavery, white supremacy, anti-democratic) terms. Such were the men who, immediately before Fort Sumter, bragged that by the end of 1861 the Southern flag would fly over Fanueil Hall in Boston. In summary, most Southerners believed the war would be short, almost bloodless, and would result in overwhelming victory for Southern valor over Northern \u201cmudsills.\u201d Thus they had no fear of war and no great desire to negotiate separation as anything other than an ultimatum presented to Washington. The North, on the other hand, was deeply divided on war up until the surrender of Fort Sumter, which united most of the factions into a desire to punish those who sought (in Northern eyes) to destroy the nation (which is what secession amounted to).
