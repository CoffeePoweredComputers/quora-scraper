            "answer_text": "Papua was a major battlefield in Pacific Theater during World War II There are numerous World War II sites you can find in the island, however since this island is big and the connectivity between cities are not extensive, I suggest you to focus in one regency, Biak Numfor, before exploring the rest. \u2014 Binsari Cave The first thing you should see in Biak is Binsari Cave. It is a massive hole on the ground leading to the hiding places of Japanese soldiers. These cave defenses combined with thick jungle of Papua were proven to be effective in countering American attacking forces that was led by General Douglas McArthur.  American forces were having problems dealing with Japanese guerrilla strategy even though they outnumbered them by far. To win the battle Brigadier General Jens Anderson Doe instructed American forces to drop barrels filled with petrol over the suspected hiding places. When the Japanese refused to surrender, they threw more drums of petrol inside the cave and set ablaze with flame-throwing weapons (some also said bombs), killing all Japanese soldiers inside the cave.  War is hell. I wandered around the cave in a cold morning, alone. And inside the cave I still can find bones and skulls of Japanese soldiers, bottles of beer, and the remains of Japanese weapons. It feels like everything just happened yesterday.  In front of the cave, you can find the wrecks of Japanese\u2019s Mitsubishi A6M Zero warplane, Type 95 Ha-Go tank, and several war vehicles. Many locals think this place is haunted. But I recommend you to go alone to feel the sensation.  It is awesome. \u2014 MacArthur Monument The more famous one is MacArthur Monument in Jayapura. During the Pacific Battle in World War II, General Douglas MacArthur set up his headquarter here overlooking Lake Sentani below. Some elders said that MacArthur ordered the soldiers to build a stone bench where he used to sit in the afternoon, discussing about strategies against Japanese forces.  The monument itself is not big. The government built this monument and small museum nearby to commemorate the war.  However, to enter this complex you need a permit issued by TNI-AD (Indonesian National Armed Forces) since this complex belongs to them. It is easy to get, just leave your ID card and you will be welcomed. \u2014 You can also find some remains of World War II across Papua, from Manokwari to Merauke. However most of these remains are scattered. ",
