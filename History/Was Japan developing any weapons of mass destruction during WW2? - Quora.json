            "answer_text": "It\u2019s foolish of me to answer your question without first getting your definition of Weapons of Mass Destruction. In Iraq, two dozen surface-to-surface missiles, several thousand tons of chemical warfare munitions, and hundreds of thousands of IED (Improvised Explosive Devices) were recovered. These meet the definition of \u201cWMD\u201d used by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2014but not the \u201cloyal opposition party\u201d in Congress or the mainstream mass media: WMD | Federal Bureau of Investigation The term was coined during the Spanish Civil War by an English clergyman: Weapons of Mass Destruction and Archbishop Cosmo Lang If either of these two definitions aren\u2019t what you mean, then don\u2019t waste your time reading further. Put another way: \u201cif you mean nuclear bombs, say \u2018nuclear bombs,\u2019 and quit pretending.\u201d Japan used air bombardment on a massive scale (for the 1930\u2019s) in China, but Imperial Japan lacked the resources for the American bomber raids of 1945 on Japan. Archbiship Cosmo Lang did mention atrocities in China when is sermon coined the phrase \u201cweapons of mass destruction.\u201d Japan had a chemical warfare capability. All combatants during World War Two did\u2014gas masks issued to both soldiers and to non-combatant civilians were a common thing in World War Two. Japan reportedly gassed China, but details are not common knowledge. No Retaliation in Kind: Japanese Chemical Warfare Policy in World War II Then there was Japan\u2019s use of biological warfare. Japan's Biological Warfare Project A means to deliver biological warfare agents to North America was used but discontinued because a news blackout kept Imperial Japan from knowing that any of their firebombs had reached the USA. Beware Of Japanese Balloon Bombs But there was a Japanes atomic bomb program: Japanese Atomic Bomb Project Were you aware that France was a leader in nuclear research before World War Two? That the USSR prior to World War Two had its nuclear research program? How about Italy\u2019s program? Enrico Fermi of the Manhattan Project was Italian and had defected from Italy rather than give Mussolini the Bomb. You probably know of Germany\u2019s unsuccessful program. Britain handed over most of her atomic secrets to American by 1943 because Britain lacked the resources to pursue this weapon. There were more programs, but only the USA had the industrial capacity and wasn\u2019t disrupted by air attacks and naval blockade and could spend 2 billion dollars on the Manhattan Project over a period of three years to produce a working weapon. There\u2019s an aspect often ignored\u2014delivery systems. The B-29 project during World War Two cost the American taxpayer 3 billion dollars, 50% more than the atomic bomb. The B-29 was developed to deliver \u201cconventional\u201d weapons of mass destruction, but was adapted to carry two types of atomic bombs. Boeing B-29 Superfortress - Wikipedia Note that the B-29 was specifically developed to fight Imperial Japan. Did Japan develop and use Weapons of Mass Destruction? Yes! Did Japan develop and use nuclear weapons? No. They tried, they did their best, but their program was too little resources and they ran out of time. If you mean \u201catomic bombs\u201d when you mumble \u201cWeapons of Mass Destruction,\u201d say \u201catomic bombs.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The Japanese military's atomic bomb development began in 1940, and the codename \"\u4e8c\u53f7\u7814\u7a76 ( Number two investigation)\" continued until 1944, but it was never used in combat.The novel of the Japanese army Unit 731 in the \"\u60aa\u9b54\u306e\u98fd\u98df(Devil's satiety)\" which was serialized in the organization paper of the Japanese Communist Party from 1981, but has been advertised all over the world as if to come out of history as if, but, report of \" RESEARCHING JAPANESE WAR CRIMES \", which studies war crimes in Japan that began during the Clinton administration in 1999, is followinghttps://www.archives.gov/files/iwg/japanese-war-crimes/introductory-essays.pdf (P23-) ************************************************************** As for Unit 731, researchers found no new classified evidence related to Gen. Ishii's experiments or the unit's treatment of POWs. The small amount of newly released material adds more evidence to the already well-documented facts about Japanese abuse of prisoners. As for the primary question of Unit 731's alleged experimentation on captured American servicemen, multiple government agencies conducted exhaustive searches in intelligence, military, and diplomatic records but found no definitive evidence.This was not surprising, because repeated Congressional inquiries about Japan's alleged use of American prisoners in experiments resulted in extensive examination of U.S. Army and other government agency records in the 1970s, 1980s, and again in early 1990s. In other words, Congressional interest in Japanese war crimes, especially those perpetrated against American POWs, had already opened the existing Unit 731 documents in the possession of the U.S. government and made them available to the public. ************************************************************** ",
