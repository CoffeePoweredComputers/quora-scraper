            "answer_text": "\u201cFrom a historical standpoint, was Jesus a real person? What evidence do we have that he existed?\u201d (based on a previous answer) In fact He did. This is really not even up for debate any more, but here goes\u2026 All history is at some level subject to scrutiny under which it cannot hold weight. However, we accept much of history on far less basis than we have for Jesus Christ. The most numerous New Testament books that mention Jesus are the epistles, or letters. These were simply what they are called - letters; to and from friends and fellow followers of Jesus, all amidst much persecution. Only with the passing of time and increased skepticism, is such a controversial historical figure as Jesus Christ less and less believed, by those exhibiting chronological snobbery. Those who wrote these letters lived during Jesus\u2019 lifetime or with others who did, and knew such events to be indisputable fact. To dismiss these letters is a blatant dogmatic attempt to disregard evidence, if not proof, simply because it contradicts one\u2019s own ideology. The Gospels were written after these letters, to better document Jesus\u2019 life, and were contemporary enough to be written while many of the people who physically saw Jesus were still alive. So legendary development is out of the question. It was simply too soon. The gospels are subject to the same rigorous scrutiny as every other historical text, probably more, and many who study them end up coming not only to validate them but believe them. Most of history we know and accept on other matters, was written well after the amount of time between when Jesus lived and the accounts of His life were recorded. Even Alexander the Great\u2019s fullest life account was written by Arrian over 400 years after his lifetime. Do we doubt there was someone named Alexander the Great? So why do people doubt there was a man named Jesus? There are several extra-biblical sources too: TacitusJosephusPliny the YoungerThe Babylonian Or Jewish TalmudLucianFanatical skeptics who deny there was a man named Jesus, are then forced to deny these writings too, with only circular reasoning to do so. I\u2019m not aware of any other recorded historical figure whose existence is denied despite such ubiquitous documentation, from different groups, people and perspectives. Also, keep in mind, Jesus was an itinerant carpenter from a small backwater village in a remote part of the Roman empire, whose earthly career lasted a mere 3 years, seemed to end in a resounding defeat, and left His followers defeated; at least for a few days. That He was written about as much as He was, is undeniable evidence of His life. That we have no writings from Him is irrelevant. We have no writings from Socrates either. Some wrote of Him to attack the Christian movement. I\u2019m also not aware of any writings that said in effect, \u2018everyone is talking about this Jesus guy, but he clearly seems to be an invention.\u2019 Ultimately though, the joke is on the skeptic. If we follow their logic, we should have no history at all, because Jesus is one of the most well documented historical figures of his time. So if we don\u2019t have sufficient records for HIM, then we can\u2019t trust any history we do have about anyone or anything. The fact is the overwhelming majority of scholars, historians, experts and skeptics alike agree Jesus was a real person. Anyone claiming otherwise is on the lunar fringes of conspiratorial conjecture. The heart of the matter and probably the reason skeptics dismiss Jesus as legendary, hinges upon this: Was Jesus the son of God? Skeptics raise several points against the facts here, but some of the reasons I believe He was are: Jesus\u2019s words and actions indicate He equated Himself with God (accepting worship, use of I AM and son of man, I and the father are one)Jesus\u2019s miracles have been discounted, but the substantial testimony we have of them, and the recency of their writing would make them very likely trueWhen worshiped for performing such acts He did not rebuke or correctHe offered forgiveness of sins, something only God could doJesus predicted many things (and many things were predicted about Him) that came true during His life and after, many of which He would not have been able to controlThe resurrection is still the best explanation of all the facts surrounding His death and crucifixion.He is still changing people\u2019s lives todayThese are all positively evidenced points. Anyone countering them assumes the burden of proving otherwise. Often the skeptic thinks denial of reality places the burden on the believer of that reality, but in the cases of Jesus that\u2019s just irresponsible intellectual laziness. Many other theories have been suggested, but none of them hold up. As Atheist Bart Ehrman said \u201cThe reality is that whatever else you may think about Jesus, he certainly did exist.\u201d So was Jesus real? Yes. Was He the son of God? That\u2019s for each to decide on their own. Even demands of evidence shift the burden of that responsibility to someone else. YOU must decide. Who do you say I AM?  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Jesus was a real person. He is mentioned by two contemporary authors within twenty years of his death; three biographies within forty to sixty years of his death; at least seven additional Christian sources and one Jewish source before the close of the first century (seventy years after his death); and another three or four Christian sources and two Roman historians within the first two decades of the second century (ninety years after his death). Additionally, the brother of Jesus is mentioned in two contemporary Christian sources (written while he was still alive), as well as another Christian source and a Jewish source within twenty years of his death. There are more extant documents from the first century that mention Jesus than there are that do not mention him. There are nearly a dozen references and three biographies written well within plausible living memory (up to sixty years after his death). These historical references also pass a number of smell checks, i.e. they include embarrassing material that his followers would not likely fabricate; the names, titles, geography, and events are accurate for the period; numerous aspects of his life are attested in multiple independent sources, including contrary sources that clearly reflect multiple lines of transmission; etc. It is true that there are a handful of scholars who believe that Jesus never existed; one of whom insisted until his death that Jesus was actually a psychedelic mushroom (a conclusion that he drew after eating a psychedelic mushroom). These poor folks are generally given just slightly more credence, because of their degrees, than the television program Ancient Aliens. Few of them have published their conclusions in peer-reviewed sources, and those that have were either ignored or politely mocked by the academic community. ",
