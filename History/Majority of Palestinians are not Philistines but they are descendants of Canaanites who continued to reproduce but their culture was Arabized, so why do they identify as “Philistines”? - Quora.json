            "answer_text": "Not even a small percentage of today\u2019s Palestinians can trace their history to the Philistines, Greek invaders living in the small coastal strip from Gaza to approx. Tel Aviv between 1200\u2013600 BC[1]. It is quite possible that of the few hundred thousand inhabitants of the area of Palestine at the beginning of the 19th. century a few hundred did have DNA of descendants of Canaanites. The current Palestinians (previous Palestinians were the Jews during the British Mandate for Palestine 1923\u20131948[2]) are 90% migrants from countries surrounding the area of Palestine, or for argument sake, Israel and Judea & Samaria, the land west of the Jordan river. They identify themselves today (actually the last 50 years) as Palestinians in order to try to make a connection between them and the Philistines, mentioned in the Bible and Thora:  Another reason is to make themselves smaller and powerless as new Palestinians in their struggle against Israel.Was until the sixties of the last century the concept of the conflict one of tiny Israel against all the Arab nations who wanted to push the Jews into the sea and thus Israel received much mental support and empathy as underdog from the western world, today it\u2019s the mighty Israel against the small and powerless nation of Palestinians fighting for independence. The myth of a Palestinian people is explained in this often quoted interview of a then prominent Palestinian leader Zuheir Mohsen in the Dutch newspaper Trouw from 1977, which I have translated so no one can argue that the well known sentences were taken out of context:  We are only Palestinians for political reasons By James Dorsey, Trouw, 31 March 1977 He is our leader. \"Thousands like me believe in him\" says one of the bodyguards of Zouhair Mohsen, leader of the pro-Syrian, Palestinian guerrilla-organization Al Saika. Mohsen, who is also head of the department military operations of the Palestinian freedom movement PLO and member of the executive board of the PLO was in Cairo for a meeting of the Palestinian national council. In spite of the loyalty of his followers and the important position he holds in the movement (\"if I do not insist, nobody can make a decision\") he shouldn't have felt at ease in Cairo. He was not treated warmly by his Palestinian friends during the sessions of the council.Mohsen and his Palestinian guerilla fighters belong politically to the ruling Baath party in Syria. Within the PLO he represents the interests of Syria. Many inside the Palestinian resistance did not forget the events during the Lebanese civil war, when the Syrian army turned against the alliance between the Palestinians and the left wing of the Lebanese people. Several times it came to clashes between Al Saika and the largest Palestinian guerilla movement Al Fatah. During the Lebanese civil war rumors emerged that the regime in Damascus would like to see a replacement of PLO leader Arafat by Mohsen. Dislike Irrespective of the seemingly unity at the Palestinian congress between Saika and most of the other Palestinian groups, many Palestinian leaders did not make an effort to conceal their dislike of Al Saika.Most clearly was the strained relationship highlighted after the murder of the Lebanese left-wing leader Kamal Joumblat, the Fatah representative in Cairo. Ribhi Awad shouted the \"murderers are among us\" while pointing in the direction of Mohsen and his followers.The roots of the antagonisms within the Palestinian movement are much deeper than the war in Lebanon. Mohsen position is because of the Baathist colored Arabic nationalism much closer to the followers of the Palestinian rejection front, which he himself describes as \"romantics and fascists\" than to the ideological position of for instance, Al Fatah.We believe that the Palestinians first of all have to cooperate with Syria and after that, with the other Arab states. Only Syria can play an effective role in the battle against Israel. We cannot operate out of Egypt. Syria is for us the most important base since the battle against the Zionists invasion in 1918. Not a people Mohsen's position is not so astounding. Listening to his political and ideological opinions one cannot suppress sometimes the feeling that maybe there has not been such a big change in the Arab world than initially was assumed. According to Mohsen there is namely in effect no separate Palestinian people. \"Between Jordanians, Syrians and Lebanese do not exist differences. We are part of one people, the Arab nation. Look, I have relatives with Palestinian (sic.), Lebanese, Jordanian and Syrian citizenship. We are one people. Only for political reasons do we meticulously endorse our Palestinian identity. That is to say that it is of national importance for Arabs to encourage the existence of the Palestinians against Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity is only for tactical reasons. The foundation of a Palestinian state is a new means to continue the battle against Israel and for the Arab unity. Mohsen logic is actually very simple: \"Because Golda Meir argues there is no Palestinian people, I say there is a Palestinian people which distinguishes itself from Jordan. Strategy Also the strategy that Mohsen wants to follow is quite simple: \"A separate Palestinian entity must assert the national rights in the then remaining occupied territories. The Jordan government cannot speak on behalf of the Palestinians in Israel, Lebanon or Syria. Jordan is a state with defined borders. It cannot claim for instance Haifa, Jaffa, while I do have claims to Haifa, Jaffa, Jerusalem or Beersheva. Jordan can only speak on behalf of the Jordanians and Palestinians in Jordan. The Palestinian state should have the right to act on behalf of all Palestinians in the Arab world and elsewhere. Once we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.\" Covenant The analysis of Mohsen about the function of the existence of a Palestine people is not the only political covenant he held with the official Israeli position. One of the Israeli arguments to hold on to the in 1967 occupied territories is the concept of secure and defensible borders. Notwithstanding the Arab countries and the Palestinians constantly wipe off the table this concept in their war of propaganda against Israel, was actually the thought of safe borders the crux of Mohsen defense of the Syrian intervention in the Lebanese civil war: \"The Syrians intervened only in Lebanon in order to stop the hostilities. This was the only purpose to be accepted as intermediator by all parties. Syria thought that the security of Syria would be compromised by a renewed war in Lebanon.\" Footnotes[1] Philistines - Wikipedia[2] Mandate for Palestine - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "They are Arabs, they speak Arabic, their culture is Arab. However, they would identify as Palestinian not because they are linked to the ancient Philistines or that they are descendants of Canaanites, but because their Arab culture descended from the Arabs that lived for generations in a region called Palestine. The region was named such by the Romans first. Subsequent empires came, conquered it and still called it Palestine. In recent history, the region called Palestine was controlled by the Ottoman Turks and it was taken away by the British empire which renamed the region the British Mandate of Palestine. Arabs living there were called Palestinian Arabs and Jews living there were called Palestinian Jews. However, since the founding of Israel, Jews living there prefer to be called Israelis rather than Palestinian Jews. So, Palestinians today are actually Palestinian Arabs or Arabs from Palestine. They have nothing to do with the ancient Philistines. ",
