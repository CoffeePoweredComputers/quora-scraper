            "answer_text": "This was not a novelty, as kings in various countries had mistresses. The novelty was the publicity of their status, and the large endowment in land and properties that they were granted in return. In a machist society as it was then, having mistresses was a source of prestige. Louis the 16th, descendent of the Sun King and victim to the Revolution, was mocked because he had none. Altogether, Louis the 14th had only 13 mistresses, 3 of whom played a prominent role, whereas his ancestor Henry the 4th, founder of the Bourbon dynasty, had about 30. Louis the 14th fell in love at the age of 15 with Marie Mancini, the niece of his tutor, Cardinal Mazarin. The whole court\u2019s attention was focused on the affair, but Mazarin sent his niece back to her native Italy, and pushed the king into a political marriage with boring Marie Therese of Austria. There were strong rumors the following year when Mazarin died, as the king\u2019s brother, known as \u201cMonsieur\u201d was married to their cousin Henriette of England from the Stuart dynasty. Unlike his brother who was a womanizer, Monsieur was known for not being into ladies. However, nothing about Henriette and Louis was ever proved. She died poisoned, and her husband\u2019s longtime minion was suspected to be the culprit. Gracious Louise de la Valli\u00e8re was the Sun King\u2019s first official favorite, conveniently installed in a small castle in the forest next to Versailles. She enchanted the king by her tastes for music and literature, and took advantage of her position to patron artists. The liaison irritated prominent churchmen and amused the rest of the court. She was genuinely in love with the king, whom she gave four children, and was embarrassed by the publicity.  However, Louise fell into disgrace, in favor of the luscious Madame de Montespan. Madame\u2019s husband made a scandal about it, and was put in prison before being exiled on his own lands. You were supposed to appreciate the honor of being a \u201croyal cuckold\u201d. Montespan fostered seven children, but as she became too plump, the king started to lose interest. She was compromised in a scandal involving love potions and black masses, which ended in the last witch trials in French history (1682).  Louis had started getting nearer to the governess of his natural children, the Marquise of Maintenon. In fact, she was quite an austere lady and a pious catholic who convinced the king to marry her privately, and allegedly pushed him to abolish the Nantes edict, causing the exile of the Huguenots in 1685. She was unpopular for the spirit of bigotry that fell on the court, but the liaison was serious business as Louis never had any known mistress for the thirty years that ensued.  So all in all, Louis the 14th was very active for about 20 years, and then devout and faithful for the 30 others. By comparison, his successor Louis the 15th continued all his reign long, and let the unique Madame de Pompadour become a political figure. Royal mistresses were considered all the more normal that marriages were arranged, but they could end up having decisive political influence. Although there were no tabloids, gossip was rife in the court and extended to all of Paris, if not the whole country. Women had practically no rights in these times, and unless widowed, were subdued to their husbands all their life long. Forced marriages were common then, as denounced by Moli\u00e8re, but the mistresses were in no way compelled. In fact, they were in strong competition, and being the kings\u2019s mistress was a way for several women to fulfil their personal ambitions. The children they fostered had no claim to the throne, but they were given high positions in the court. It was all a totally different time and mentality. This amounted to an unofficial polygamy system. Similar patterns and intrigues have been observed in courts where polygamy did exist, such as Turkey or China. Catholic countries had seemingly a much larger acceptance of this than protestant ones. ",

            "answer_text": "Louis the XIVth was diagnosed with a \u201ccomplexe amoureux\u201d or \u201cloving complexe\u201d by his doctors since the age of 7 ou 8\u2026 which means he was pretty precocious in the matter of sensuality. It\u2019s known that the favorite young king wet nurse keep going to work as a housemaid for Louis because each time he was upset, he needed to dive his face in the woman breast\u2026 Also, since her son was an infant, the Queen Anna of Austria had taken the curious habit to bring him with her when she was bathing to avoid him any shyness with women. In the other hand, his younger brother Philippe d\u2019Anjou, was disguised with girl clothes by their mother\u2019s servants since he was a toddler to \u201clowering\u201d his manly behavior and cutting any aspiration for the throne. As second son he was seen like a menace for the first born\u2026 it\u2019s seems this educational system has derailed somewhat and the king who was just supposed to be a \u201ctrue man\u201d become eventually a real womanizer. At least he used to have a certain sense of honor : whatever his adulterous life, he came back to his wife every single night. Wars time apart\u2026 ",
