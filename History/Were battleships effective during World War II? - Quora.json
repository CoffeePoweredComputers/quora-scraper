            "answer_text": "Effective for what? Did battleships serve as the capital ships, the main offensive striking power of the fleet? Not for the United States. Some senior leaders in the Imperial Japanese Navy still saw battleships in this role as late as Leyte Gulf in October 1944. That battle may have been the death knell of the battleship as capital ship. Effective in other roles? Absolutely! The U.S. Navy employed these massive engines of war in two principal roles. They served as bombardment platforms supporting amphibious landings and as escorts for the aircraft carriers. In the latter role, the addition of significant numbers of anti-aircraft guns to the American fast battleships made them invaluable. The older battleships were largely relegated to the bombardment mission, although this led to these ships engaging in the last battleship duel in history. ",

            "answer_text": "Indeed yes. In general not as effective as aircraft carriers, but they did accomplish a lot. A few examples: German surface raiders devastated Allied shipping until destroyed or forced to stay in port by enemy navies - mostly battleships and cruisers. Few of these were battleships, but they certainly did damage. The British Navy, again mostly cruisers and destroyers, sank or forced back every one of the German troop ships heading for Crete. Of 8,000 German soldiers on those ships, exactly 1 managed to land and assist in the invasion. Had the Germans had a modern battleship to oppose those British warships, that battleship would have done the same number on them that they had done on the troopships.; The Germans kept one battleship in Norway (first Bismark, then Tirpitz). This Tied up a large concentration of the British navy. That one battleship forced the British to keep three or four battleships on hand (typically in Scapa Flow) to counter them. The Brits did not want a fair fight, so they figured they needed a two-on-one advantage. Since battleships need refitting and maintenance, the result was about four battleships had to be dedicated to locking up that one German battleship. Battleships were very effective at bombardment in support of an invasion. Perhaps someone else can supply the number of shells fired by the Warspite in support of troops on D-day, but the ships used up all of its shells and had to be re-stocked three time during that day. That ship took out a tremendous number of targets on that one day. Of course, if the question meant to uncover whether battleships still determined which side one in naval battles in WWII, aircraft carriers were almost always more potent. ",
