            "answer_text": "Imagine that you were traveling with group of friends and you met with a man who was very old and who was aware that he was near the end of his earthly life and you asked him: \u2018what was it like to be at his stage of life?\u2019 The old man answered that he felt prepared because he had paid all his debts and given to everyone what they were due. This answer provokes a discussion about the whole question of paying and receiving what is due and how to understand what people call \u2018justice\u2019. Rather than just argue about the meaning of the word \u2018justice\u2019 it is agreed to explore \u2018justice\u2019 through making a \u2018thought experiment\u2019 by trying to imagine what a community would be like if everything was organised to prioritise \u2018justice\u2019 before any other desirable quality such as \u2018freedom\u2019. Obviously this thought experiment is purely to explore and become more clear about what \u2018justice\u2019 really is and it would be really ridiculous for anyone to confuse this thought experiment with a real proposal for an ideal community which, of course, would have to take into account not just one quality such as justice but many other imperatives including individual freedom, security, family life, etc and would involve a compromise between many such different desirable qualities. The thought experiment discussion proceeds and many interesting contributions are made towards maximising justice for all including giving equal opportunities for women (which was unheard of at this time) enabling everyone to have a job doing what they were particularly good at so that everyone in the community benifited from each persons individual one-sidedness and only being governed by civil servants who were very well educated but not allowed to have any family or personal assets. These so called \u2018guardians\u2019 were required to live in community owned premises that any member of the public could also inspect at anytime and these \u2018guardians\u2019 were not even allowed to own any of the furniture in the rooms were they sleep. (This seems rather extreme but it would be necessary to ensure that the ruling guardians only made decisions that are in the interest of the whole community and not themselves.) Imagine that one of those present at this discussion about the meaning of justice found it so interesting that they wrote down the whole dialogue. Afterwards something quite unexpected happenened. People read the written account of the discussion, not very carefully, and decided that it could only be interpreted as the authors political manifesto for a perfect society and proceeded to accuse the author of promoting tyranny and totalitarianism. Somehow this interpretation persisted for more that two thousand years because all through this time nobody bothered to carefully read what was said in the published account of the discussion. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the major parts of Plato\u2019s philosophy is to reform society through redefining democracy. Let's study this further. Plato didn't believe in the current process of voting and democracy. However, he didn't hate democracy as well. He simply wanted to redefine the system through which we choose our rulers. He said that, the present process of voting and democracy is completely useless if the rulers who are chosen are not able enough to rule in the first place. He elaborated that, democracy will be meaningful if and only if the rulers are philosophers. By this he meant that, the rulers must have earned the ability to rule through a strict regime and lots of theoretical and practical tests which Plato devised as follows. Plato thought of an utopian society that would be the ideal society because in that society, the rulers will be prepared through years of training and by overcoming several obstacles, just like a doctor is prepared through years of imparting knowledge to a student and taking numerous tests to judge his ability at each stage. Plato thought that, to prepare such rulers, all the children of that society or state would be trained in every department from a very early age. This training would be in the form of a universal education. However, the children would have to remain separate from their parents, as bad habits from the parents can easily seep in. For the first ten years of their life, the education of the children would mostly be physical to ensure a healthy body that will not need the help of medicines. But, only physical education can be one sided. Therefore, the children will also be introduced to music to bring a sense of harmony and rhythm in their life. As these children grow up, they'll also be taught the value of unity. However, this wouldn't be taught through rigorous means, as that may be brutal and not serve the actual purpose of uniting the students. Plato thought that, it is here that religion is so necessary. Religion will most certainly unite this huge number of diverse people into one. Having the same religious beliefs generates a sense of unity even in complete strangers. Repeated tests will be conducted throughout the entire regime which will get harder and harder with the next stage. It is only after the age of thirty that one of the ultimate test will be conducted on the students. It is expected that, only a few students will pass this test. Those few are the lucky ones that will finally get the taste of philosophy. After rigorous years of studying philosophy, they will possess all the essential knowledge that Plato believed should be present in an ideal ruler. Yet, Plato says that, all this knowledge is merely theoretical. Therefore, to acquire a practical experience of this world, they'll be further trained and within these philosophers, some will crumble under the practical situations that the real world will present to them. The very few that finally pass this final test are worthy to be rulers according to Plato. However, even after becoming rulers, these men have to make the ultimate sacrifice of not possessing any property or money or similar things other than what is just necessary for their survival. They will commit to only the state, not to themselves or even their families. Thus, society will be reformed through redefining democracy. This is the utopian society that Plato believed should be the political model of every state. Thanks for asking. ",
