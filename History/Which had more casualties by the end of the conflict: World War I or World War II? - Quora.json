            "answer_text": "Estimates about casualties in both World Wars vary widely and so should be taken with a grain of salt. Having said that, I'll put the numbers (that I think reasonable) on the table for further discussion. - World War 1: There were about 17 million - 20 million deaths in World War 1. Another 20 millions were wounded. Approximately 95% of the casualties were military personnel, the remaining 5% being civilians. (*) - World War 2: About 80 millions of people were killed in World War 2. However, different from World War 1, about 70% of the deaths (or 55 million people) were civilians - the other 30% (about 25 million) were military personnel. (**) So the answer to the question is: Military casualties in World War 2 were a little higher than in World War 1 but total casualties (including civilians) were far far worse in WW2 than in WW1. An obvious question to ask at this point is \"Why were civilian casualties in WWW2 so high?\" I can think of 2 main reasons: The nature of the fighting and the belligerents' policies toward civilians:  World War 1 was characterized by stalemate caused by trench warfare which was pretty much the worst fighting condition in history. Soldiers had to stay in trenches full of mud mixed with pisses and feces, rotten corpses lying everywhere. The armies weren't typically moving very fast, even not moving at all for weeks. Tanks were introduced very late in the war and did not have a significant impact.    These were all very bad news for the troops but not-so-bad for the civilians since they had time to evacuate from war zones and battlefields.  On the other hand, World War 2 (especially the Eastern Front of the war) was characterized by highly mobile armored warfare. The Wehrmacht in 1941-42 and the Red Army in 1944-45 could advance up to 50-80 miles in a single day, trapping huge number of civilian behind the front line. (For example, by the end of 1941 - about 60 millions of Soviet people in Byelorussia and Ukraine were behind enemy line). Now that the civilians had been trapped, what did the belligerents do to them?  Many of the civilians were killed as they were caught up in the fighting. Other were obliterated by deliberate and systematic actions by nations. For instance: the Nazis systematically killed an estimated 6 million Jews and an additional 11 million people during the Second World War - these were the people that Hitler and the Nazis considered 'subhuman' or 'undesirable'. Polish Jews loaded onto trains to Nazi concentration camps  Emaciated prisoners in Mauthausen concentration camp  Dead bodies of prisoners at Dachau concentration camp  Meanwhile, World War 1 witnessed no mass deportation, no concentration camps and nothing resembling the horror of the Nazi Holocaust.  Another thing to keep in mind is that although World War 2 was fought with unprecedented ferocity, many of the soldiers were not killed in combat - they surrendered and were captured as prisoners of war. The highly mobile armored warfare of World War 2 made it possible to move large, powerful units quickly to encircle the enemy with 2 classic pincers. Sometimes, the encircled troops simply surrendered. At other times, they fought on desperately until they ran out of fuel, food, ammunition then surrendered. In 1941, the Wehrmacht captured more than 500,000 Soviet troops around Kiev and 370,000 Soviet troops around Vyazma and Bryansk. In Operation Barbarossa alone, the Germans captured some 3.3 million Soviet troops. In 1944 and 1945, the Soviets in turn also captured millions of German soldiers.  It's possible that the casualties estimates just include the ones killed (and wounded), and not the ones captured, that's one reason why the military casualties in WW2 were actually much lower than expected.  And although being held prisoners wasn't very attractive, many of the PoWs would eventually make it home alive (***)   (*) & (**) Dirty little secret of World War 2 by James F. Dunnigan and Albert A.

            "answer_text": "About 17 million dead in WWI.  Most were soldiers.  However, it also directly led to the Turkish War of Independence and the Russian Civil War, which caused a further 10 million deaths in total (highest estimate).  WWII caused anywhere between 50-80 million deaths, with the higher end estimates including war induced famine, one of the primary causes of death in pre-modern wars.  The majority were civilians. You are right.  WWI battles were far bloodier.  When comparing the Western Fronts anyways.  There's a reason why the British fled in WWII and France surrendered.  WWI was still a fresh memory.  At the Battle of Frontiers in the opening days of the war, 27,000 French soldiers were killed in a single day, 50% more than the first day of the Somme.  Compare this to D-Day, the largest amphibious invasion in history, where \"only\" 5,000 soldiers were killed.  From this, WWI certainly seems deadlier but that's only because the main area of fighting had shifted away from the fields of Belgium and France to the rolling steppe of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. About 15 million soldiers died in less than 4 years of combat on the Eastern Front.  That averages to 11,000 soldiers killed every day, not far from the first day of the Somme.  Except this happened every single day.  This isn't counting the 15-17 million civilians who were massacred on the Eastern Front.  The average deaths per day from all causes in WWI was less than the average deaths per day for just soldiers on the Eastern Front in WWII.  As for why generals seemed to careless with their soldiers in WWI, they were trained for mobile wars with grand maneuvers in the vein of Napoleon, not the slow stalemate they found themselves in.  The technological deck was simply too stacked against them, with tons of weapons that helped a defender but few that helped break static fortifications.  Tanks came late in the war and gas was largely ineffective if your enemy was equipped.  As a result, generals were forced to play different variations on \"throw more men at it\" to break the stalemate and resume a mobile war that they were trained to fight.  That said, the tactics used evolved greatly between 1914 and 1918 to become much more targeted and finessed.    Inaccurate but still funny ",
