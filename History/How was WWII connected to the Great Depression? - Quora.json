            "answer_text": "The Great Depression led to the rise to power of the Adolf Hitler and his National Socialists. In 1928 the Nazis were getting about 1% of the German vote, by 1932\u20133 the Nazis were getting a least a third of the entire German vote and were the largest single political party, President Hindenburg (a very old man by 1933 - although he had managed to defeat Hitler in the Presidential election by 1932) was told he could not really keep the Nazis out of a coalition government - and once Mr Hitler and the Nazis were in government they quickly took over all power. Mass unemployment did not \u201cclear\u201d in Germany in very early 1930s, for the same reason it did not \u201cclear\u201d in the United States under Herbert \u201cThe Forgotten Progressive\u201d Hoover. In neither country did REAL WAGES really fall in response to the great economic slump (government policy actually PREVENTED Real Wages falling in line with the economic slump) - mass unemployment not just emerged, it REMAINED for year after year. This gave the Nazis their chance in Germany. Mr Hitler and his National Socialists were (like the militarists who took over in Japan in the 1930s) committed to unlimited conquest - the Great Depression (mass unemployment and economic collapse) led to the rise of the Nazis to power - and the Nazis created World War II. \u201cIt is simplistic to say that Mr Hitler and his National Socialists created World War II by their policy of unlimited conquest\u201d - it may be \u201csimplistic\u201d but it is also THE TRUTH.

            "answer_text": "Only in the sense that when the economies of the world crashed Germany was starved for capital investments, the government of Germany started printed money like crazy and it caused hyper inflation. The situation in Germany became horrific and people were desperate enough to trust a silly little melodramatic hypochondriac with a stupid mustache that insured Germans he could manage everything and put people back to work. Desperate economic times often pave the way for cult of personality leaders. ",
