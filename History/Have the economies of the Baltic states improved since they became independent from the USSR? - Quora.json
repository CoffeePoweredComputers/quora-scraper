            "answer_text": "The Baltic Tigers and Ireland have developed the most since then. And they have handled recession best. They had young well developed people with Western and Nordic orientation who replaced Russian administration, and many were also economic migrants to Ireland. The Baltic economy grew faster than anyone in Europe from 2000 to 2007 (up to 8\u201312% per year), they had the most serious recession in 2009, and they recovered more quickly from the severe recession than anyone in the EU, with GDP rates growing 6\u20138% again in 2011. The Baltic states are parts of North Europe and situated between North Central and Northeast Europe. They score between number 30 and 45 in global human development reports, only matched by non-Soviet Slovenia and the former Soviet satellites Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary in the former East. And they use IT development and access to fight Russian disinformation, propaganda and national populism, which are eating up the others from within, except for Slovenia, which is equally small and strong, between South, South Central and Southeast Europe. The Baltic states were the most industrialised and economically developed Soviet republics, they strongly opposed demographic Russianisation, and they had access to Finnish and Swedish radio and even had their own Soviet hippie movement. After the nuclear disaster in Tjernobyl, the Polish independent workers union and the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain, the Baltic people formed a human chain singing themselves free, and then all the three small states declared independence together, thereby effectively dissolving the Soviet Union forever.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely, unquestionably yes! Life is actually much better now than it was at any time between WWII and 1990. Let\u2019s take Lithuania. This is the GDP PPP of Lithuania since declaring independence from USSR (According to tradingeconomics.com). If Lithuania was a company you invested in right after the fall of USSR, you\u2019d be a rich person today. Yes, there was a drop right after, but that has a lot to do with a country trying to rebuild itself from years of terror, corruption and international neglect.  Let\u2019s see how things are in Latvia. Looks like the graph is nearly identical, but the numbers are slightly lower (Same source).  Last, but certainly not least - Estonia! Let\u2019s see how things are there. (Same source as before). Looks like Estonia started on even lower ground than Lithuania and Lithuania, but is now on par with Lithuania.  In my opinion, GDP PPP tells the best (but certainly NOT perfect) story of how an average person is living in a particular country. So if I am an average Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian, life looked quite bleak under Soviet occupation and remained so for a bit while each country was trying to stitch themselves back together. There is no way that these countries\u2019 economies could have looked like this had the Soviets maintained their occupation. ",

            "answer_text": "No Unfortunately for the Baltics, their meager size means that they have almost no ability to create a self sufficient modern economy. Combined, they have fewer people than Los Angeles County, California. The Baltic republics used to be the most prosperous in the USSR - due to the building of high tech industries there, Nuclear plants providing cheap power, and generally being subsidized by the Soviet government. They lost their market access and privileged position in the USSR. The electronics manufacturing and agriculture they had under the Soviet system was not allowed to continue once they joined the EU, nor would they be able to compete. Constant anti-Russia agitation has resulted in Russia cutting them out of the profitable transit business - Russia has built its own shipping terminals, bypassing the ones in the Baltic republics. The demographic collapse these countries are undergoing is a direct result of the lack of opportunity for young people in the post-Soviet world. While they make a big deal of their IT prowess, this is silly, outsourced IT services can be provided by much poorer countries such as India. ",

            "answer_text": "The Baltic States economies have slightly improved in 2 things: a) They have become post-industrial not industrial economies, turning away more attention to services, transport, IT and the like. Instead of useless awkward heavy (formerly military) industry like Belarus has, their economies have become more flexible. Russian propaganda mourns the \u201clost subsidized industries\u201d, but in fact now Lithuanian GDP per year with less than 3 million people is almost the same as Belarus with 10 million residents. Also they have managed to keep their assets in the food industry (which the USSR was unable to work efficiently) and in the light (textile) industry. The work ethic is also high by local workers / engineers thus there is a wave of medium size industry investments coming. b) They have quit the idiotic dream of the 90s that they would be the \u201ctrade bridge between West and East\u201d, less relying on precarious \u201cpartners\u201d from Russia. The export / import of Baltic states is slowly turning away from Russia to Germany, Finland, Scandinavia. Of course, for that they have produce more value-added production not only raw material, which is also good for development. Also, thanks to EU, the Baltic countries have much better infrastructure (the roads are times better than in former USSR), and Rail Baltica is also coming. ",

            "answer_text": "In the USSR times, Baltic countries had pretty high consumption per capita among soviet republics, comparing with production. Top number is per capita production, recalculated into thousands USD per year, bottom number is per capita consumption. Yes I know converting soviet ruble to US dollar makes little sense for absolute value, but this is relative production/consumption we are interested in.  Then they joined EU, they kept that tendency, but they got paid in Euro.  So instead of being subsidized in Soviet rubles they are being subsidized in Euros - looks like win for me. ",
