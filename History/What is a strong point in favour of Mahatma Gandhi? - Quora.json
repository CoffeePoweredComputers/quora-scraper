            "answer_text": "So many people indicate the faults of Mah\u0101tm\u0101 Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi but does it effects anybody? NO! It\u2019s like asking the lamp posts if dogs affect them.Mahatma Gandhi is considered one of the greatest leaders that the world has even seen.He is a role model for all the upcoming leaders. Gandhi got his start as an activist in South Africa, not India.When Gandhi was growing up, few people would\u2019ve predicted he\u2019d one day attract millions of followers, be considered the father of his nation and even appear in Apple\u2019s \u201cThink Different\u201d advertising campaign in the late 1990s. In fact, as a boy, Gandhi was a middling student and extremely shy. He even described running home from school so he wouldn\u2019t have to talk to anybody.He led the Indian nationalist movement and became known around the world and is the face of INDIAN CURRENCY till date.
