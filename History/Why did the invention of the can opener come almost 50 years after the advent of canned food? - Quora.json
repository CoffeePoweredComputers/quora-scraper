            "answer_text": "I am not sure if this answers your question; but in 1810 Nicholas Appert, found that food stayed fresh for long periods of time, if you could deal it tightly in a container, he originally used a glass jar. 1810: Peter Durand, obtained a patent from King George 3, for the world's first can, made from iron and tin, using Appert's sterilization method he produced canned food. The problem was the can was to thick for a dedicated can opener; people use to smash the can open to reach the contents. Early cans could only be produced at 6 cans/ hour. 1846: Henry Evans invented a die method for making a can from a single motion; this increased production to 60 cans/ hour. 1847: Allen Taylor patented his machine stamped method of producing tin cans, which allowed for thinner and more rapidly produced cans. Because of their thinness, it was possible to produce a dedicated and practical tool for opening the can. 1858: The first can opener was invented by Ezne Warner, \u201cbayonet and sickle\" type can opener. The bayonet portion punched the can and the sickle part removed the lid, problem was it left rough edges on the can. 1866: J. Osterhoudt designed a combined opener and can in one (key opener), similar to how sardines are packed today. 1870: William Lyman designed a simple wheel that rolled around the rim of the can, cutting it open as it went. The \u201cStar Can Company\u201d made the final design change by adding serrated edges to the wheel. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is already well answered, but I just want to add that in so many cases people act according to the pyramid of primary needs. People need food first , then lodging and security. All other things pale when you lack one of the primaries. Thus the tin can was answering a primary need, the way to preserve food past the season it was grown/harvested/slaugtered in,Preserve it in such a way it can be sent anywhere, and in something that travels well as opposed to glass that broke if it jostled too much.Glass jars packed in straw also took up much more room than tin cans that needed no padding at all. Opening a can with a knife is still relatively easy if you take your time, and are careful not to cut your fingers. People made do, the can opener just made it more convenient, that is not a primary need but a luxury.. you miss the luxury if you do not have it, but if you need to eat, you will open the can, even if you have no opener.
