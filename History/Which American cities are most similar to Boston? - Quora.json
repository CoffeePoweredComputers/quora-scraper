            "answer_text": "Well, you are asking in terms of atmosphere and culture\u2026i have lived all over the US and visited most major cities and now live in Boston. In terms of geography, San Francisco is similar such that it is a peninsula with similar land mass square footage. I think the \u201dfeel\u201d of Seattle is very different from Boston but maybe you could argue it is a similarly educated populace with similar cultural offerings. To me, the city that is similar is Philadelphia due to the historical influences (both prominent colonial cities) which have maintained that feel into present age. As a city, Boston is the most \u201cfull of\u201d itself city than any other city I've lived in or visited. The people think it is the greatest city in America because of their history, their sports teams, and because more than any other city I've seen, that people living there have never lived anywhere else so they are very sheltered.

            "answer_text": "I would say Philadelphia. Population: Philly is a bit larger, with a metro area of 6 million, compared to Boston\u2019s 4.9 million. Location: Both cities sit on opposite ends of the New York Metro Area, so they both have to deal with being the \u201csecond city\u201d in the area. Ethnic Groups: Both have a significant base of Italian and Irish-Americans, but Philadelphia is more African American and Boston is more Hispanic. Urban Fabric: Philly has a grid, Boston does not, but the layout of the two cities is similar. Lots of colonial structures/historic districts coupled with centuries of modern buildings. Both cities have large seaports. Culture: Philly is less classic New England, and also doesn\u2019t have the influence of Harvard and MIT, but both have a Northeastern-US culture. Philly is greener but has a smaller subway system. Boston\u2019s North End:  South Philly:    ",

            "answer_text": "Having just returned from a trip to Boston, I would argue that San Francisco, California is very similar to Boston. They are both large port cities with very successful financial districts, but also contain several distinct and vibrant ethnic neighborhoods. Geographically, they are both fairly compact for walkability, but also boast an extensive public transportation network. Although on opposite coasts and different histories, each provides a history important to the story of the United States. Other answers will probably suggest that Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is similar for the same reasons I have provided for SF, but I think it is the proximity of the ocean sets San Francisco apart. ",

            "answer_text": "Surprised no one has mentioned Providence. Boston has a residual Puritan character not found in SF or Seattle. Compare the liquor laws! Boston was famous for banning books and for holding onto its Sunday closing laws (blue laws). The Roman Church dictated everything there right into the 1960s. SF was wide-open from the start, whereas cosmopolitanism is new to Boston. There's a similar colonial background in Providence, full of American antiquities, and you can't repeal history. But among still larger cities, I'd go with Philadelphia. Despite living as an adult in Philly, Ben Franklin was born in Boston and has a large memorial in Mt. Auburn Cemetery. ",

I find San Francisco to be similar to Seattle, so by transitive property, it should also be similar to Boston - but it doesn\u2019t have the \u201cfeel\u201d that Seattle has. San Francisco feels much bigger, and many of the neighborhoods don\u2019t feel as distinct as they do in Boston and Seattle. (Some do\u2026but many don\u2019t). Boston and Seattle have similar education levels, though there are way more colleges in Boston. This seems to be offset in Seattle by the number of educated people who move there to live. Seattle, however, has way worse public transit - so, that would be where San Fran is closer. ",
