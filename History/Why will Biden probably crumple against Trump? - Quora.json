            "answer_text": "Why? Wrong question. Why did the Democratic Establishment want to throw this election against Trump? Because they already decided that we\u2019ll lose. Because incumbents always win. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. You run the Mormon against the incumbent. You run the guy who threw away his military medals against the incumbent. You run a guy whose name reminds people of fruit against the incumbent. You run a guy everyone calls \u201cBubba\u201d against the incumbent (but Bubba won!). Thus, you need someone past their prime or not all that skilled at campaigning or with serious personality flaws or someone in a group that doesn\u2019t normally get to run at that level (hi Romney!) to go up against the incumbent. You want to get a read on the electorate (e.g., Republicans learned that being Mormon isn\u2019t a deal breaker). You don\u2019t expect to win. We didn\u2019t see the Democratic Party\u2019s A list because they don\u2019t have any belief that they could really beat Trump anyway. And the Democratic Establishment is run by old white men who aren\u2019t really harmed by a Trump presidency in any case. If the Dems were run by young Hispanics? They\u2019d have run their absolute BEST against Trump. Because young Hispanics have a lot to lose from 4 more years of Trump. Old white liberals? Will probably see their stock portfolios do better under Trump, to be perfectly honest. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. I do not think he will crumble at all. What I think he needs to prepare himself for is Trumps name calling. If he can survive that then he should be just fine. If not then we will rely on that lady waiting for Trumps DNA to hopefully take care of the problem for us. ",
