            "answer_text": "That was the minimum objective, yes. But it was far from the sole objective. But there was actually a lot of debate about what kind of concessions they could get out of the war at the time. There was talk of not only war indemnities, but a return on war indemnities from the Winter War. Arms limitations on any future Russian state, a permanent lease of the naval port at Leningrad to Finland and/or Germany. Also, Finland hoped that key areas would be annexed by allies.  More controversially, there was talk of Greater Finland. The post Russian Civil War borders largely followed the borders of the Tsarist Grand Duchy of Finland (part of Russian Empire). There were noteworthy exceptions to this, but that's off topic. Greater Finland encompassed all the areas ethnically, geopolitically, and historically interconnected to the Suomi peoples. BTW, Suomi is the Finnish word for the Finns. These borders would have given Finland sizable minority on the border areas, and exactly what size shape this empire could have taken is and was debatable. When Operation Barbarossa was planned, the myth of Germany's invisibility was at it's highest. It was thought that the war would be short and the spoils immense. But even in those days of excessive optimism, it was known that the political end results of war could be quite random. The actual end of the war in Finland is a massed Soviet counter-offensive late in the war ended in Finland making a separate peace along the post-Winter War borders. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer of this question is dependent of how you define \u201cFinland\u201d. The army did continue to occupy most of what on this map is called \u201cEast Karelia\u201d sparsely inhabited by Karelians of Russian Orthodox faith. Their culture was by many/most Finns considered as more genuinely Finnish than that of Finland itself.  . Enlarging the territory of Finland to include the brethren in all of Karelia had been a dream since the 19th century national awakening. During the Civil War in Russia, inconclusive expeditions to East Karelia were carried out by Finnish military corpses. And now, in 1941, the same Finnish circles were enticed by the hope to fulfill these old dreams \u2014 which of course was eagerly supported by representatives for the Third Reich trying to secure Finland\u2019s participation in Operation Barbarossa. Those dreams were however not converted into official policy by the government or the parliament, although they found their way into Mannerheim\u2019s infamous Sword Scabbard Declaration. In short: Expanding Finland towards Lake Onega was controversial and polarizing. The proponents were most of all to find on the far-right. But once the army had crossed the old border, also less extreme people hoped it could serve to gain a stronger position in the peace negotiations after the war.
