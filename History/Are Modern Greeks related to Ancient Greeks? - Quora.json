            "answer_text": "One thing I\u2019ve discovered from reading questions and answers on Quora is that people are bizarrely obsessed with the question of whether modern Greeks are descended from ancient Greeks. It\u2019s a subject that inevitably sparks a great deal of heated debate, with various non-Greek westerners on one side insisting that modern Greeks are not true Greeks at all while Greek people and various others insist that modern Greeks are truly descendants of the ancient Greeks. The question of whether modern Greeks are truly descendants of the ancient Greeks has a long, sordid history that goes all the way back to the nineteenth century. I have decided to weigh in on this discussion to give some relevant background information, correct some prevailing false assumptions, and, finally, give what I consider to be a sound answer on the matter.  The popular obsession with the ancestry of modern Greeks First, just to show how widespread the public interest on this subject is, here are just a few of the questions I\u2019ve encountered dealing with this subject on Quora: \u201cAre Modern Greeks related to Ancient Greeks?\u201d\u201cIs the DNA of modern Greek people similar to that of the ancient Greeks?\u201d\u201cHow did the ancient Greeks physically look like compared to the modern Greeks?\u201d\u201cAre modern Greeks just descendants of the Vlachs?\u201d\u201cAre modern Greeks \"Romioi\" (Romans) or Hellenes?\u201d\u201cWhy do modern Greeks consider themselves the descendants of the ancient Greeks, although it's well known that there have been lots of migrations and invasions in Greece since the ancient times?\u201d\u201cHow mixed are Greeks? With what races have the ancient Greeks mixed? How close are modern Greeks genetically related to ancient Greeks?\u201dA wide array of answers have already been written to all of these questions. The question \u201cAre Modern Greeks related to Ancient Greeks?\u201d alone already has seventy-two answers as my writing of this. Meanwhile, the question \u201cIs the DNA of modern Greek people similar to that of the ancient Greeks?\u201d already has thirty-five answers. Some of these answers are actually pretty good, but a lot of them are, unfortunately, incorrect\u2014either wholly or in part. One lamentable fact about this whole discussion is that it is often couched in a lot of pretty blatantly racist terms. You quite often have Greek nationalists on one side often vehemently insisting that they are of \u201cpure Greek descent.\u201d On the other side, you have all sorts of western racists insisting that modern Greeks aren\u2019t descended from the ancient Greeks and therefore aren\u2019t true Greeks, but rather a different race, which is nearly always implied to be inferior. The origin of the idea that modern Greeks aren\u2019t really Greek The racist aspect of this debate isn\u2019t too especially surprising, considering that racism has been present in the debate ever since it first began nearly two hundred years ago. The idea that modern Greeks aren\u2019t descended from the ancient Greeks was vigorously promulgated in the nineteenth century by the notoriously racist German writer Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer (lived 1790 \u2013 1861). Fallmerayer claimed that modern Greeks have absolutely no relation to the ancient Greeks and are not really Greeks at all, but rather barbarous mischlings born of miscegenation between various Arvanitic, Vlachic, Slavic and Turkish peoples. Fallmerayer wrote in volume one of his book Geschichte der Halbinsel Morea w\u00e4hrend des Mittelalters, originally published in 1830: \u201cDas Geschlecht der Hellenen ist in Europa ausgerottet. Sch\u00f6nheit der K\u00f6rper, Sonnenflug des Geistes, Ebenma\u00df und Einfalt der Sitte, Kunst, Rennbahn, Stadt, Dorf, S\u00e4ulenpracht und Tempel, ja sogar der Name ist von der Oberfl\u00e4che des griechischen Kontinents verschwunden.... auch nicht ein Tropfen echten und ungemischten Hellenenblutes in den Adern der christlichen Bev\u00f6lkerung des heutigen Griechenlands flie\u00dfet.\u201d Here is my own literal English translation of this passage: \u201cThe race of Hellenes has been totally exterminated in Europe. [Their] beauty of the body, brilliance of the spirit, harmony and simplicity of custom, art, competition, city, village, majestic columns and temples, yes even their name is vanished from the face of the Greek continent\u2026 Not even a drop of true and unmixed Hellenic blood flows through the veins of the Christian population of present-day Greece.\u201d Fallmerayer\u2019s hypothesis that modern Greeks are not descendants of the ancient Greeks was later used by the Nazis during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II to justify atrocities against Greek people while simultaneously praising the ancient Greeks for their achievements. Fallmerayer is also known for his promotion of the idea that there are two entirely distinct civilizations: a glorious, ever-changing, and forward-looking western civilization best exemplified by the classical Roman Empire and a backwards, superstitious, unchanging, and barbarous eastern civilization best exemplified by the Byzantine Empire. This false idea of there being two distinct civilizations is, unfortunately, still prevalent today. All these things have contributed to Fallmerayer\u2019s reputation as a Greek-hater par excellence. The Greek writer Nikos Dimou, a prominent progressive known for debunking national myths, wrote that he had been led by the Greek education system to imagine Fallmerayer as a \u201c\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u201d (aimostay\u00ed ellinof\u00e1go) which means \u201ca blood-dripping Hellene-eater.\u201d  ABOVE: Photograph taken in around 1860 of the German author Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer, who is known for promoting the hypothesis that modern Greeks have absolutely no relation to the ancient Greeks The modern racist obsession with Greek ancestry Fallmerayer\u2019s ideas have, unfortunately, found fertile ground in the English-speaking world. The eminent British classicist Mary Beard quotes a particularly racist example of a westerner regarding modern Greeks as foreign and un-Greek in her article \u201cDon\u2019t forget your pith helmet!\u201d originally published in August 2005 in the London Review of Books. She writes: \u201cIs the modern population of Greece the direct descendant of the ancient? Or is it a Slavic newcomer, as J.P. Fallmerayer in the 19th century or Romilly Jenkins in the 20th notoriously had it? The level to which this controversy has occasionally descended can be seen from a marginal comment scrawled by a racist reader in a copy of the first (1966) edition of Patrick Leigh Fermor\u2019s Roumeli: Travels in Northern Greece held by the Cambridge University Library. Where Leigh Fermor refers to the modern Greek language as being the \u2018undisputed heir of ancient Greek\u2019, the anonymous scribbler has added: \u2018Nonsense. It is the barbarous pidgin of the Albano-Slavs who defile the land of their occupation with the deformity of their \u201cdago\u201d bodies and the squalor of their politics.\u2019\u201d A Greek person once left a comment under one of my Quora answers about a saying his father used to tell him: \u201cWesterners have always loved Greeks\u2014but only the dead ones.\u201d I have gotten into something of a habit of quoting this phrase because I think it perfectly encapsulates the general attitude that most westerners have historically had towards Greeks: an attitude of praising long-dead Greek philosophers and writers in exuberant terms while treating contemporary Greeks with scorn and derision. Partly in response to these racially-motivated ideas promulgated by western racists such as Fallmerayer, Greek racists and nationalists have embraced the idea of modern Greeks as the racially pure, direct descendants of the ancient Greeks. The Golden Dawn, an extreme right-wing Neo-Nazi political party in Greece, is especially obsessed with this idea of Greek racial purity. They believe that Greeks are the supreme race and non-Greeks are filthy, impure barbarians who quite literally deserve to die. The Golden Dawn has so many delusions about the purity of Greek blood that, at least according to Greek Reporter, in 2012, they literally set up an initiative in Athens to collect blood from \u201cpureblooded\u201d Greeks to be used by \u201cpureblooded\u201d Greeks alone so, that way, those of pure Greek ancestry would not have to fear that they might inadvertently receive blood donations from foreigners, whom they regard as filthy non-Greek barbarians.  ABOVE: Photograph of Golden Dawn supporters in Thessaloniki in June 2012 holding flares. The Golden Dawn is obsessed with the idea of Greek racial purity. \u201cGreek blood\u201d is not a thing One thing that proponents of the idea that modern Greeks are not Greeks at all and the proponents of the idea that modern Greeks are the racially pure descendants of the ancients have in common is an absurd obsession with the whole idea of \u201cGreek blood.\u201d Fallmerayer spoke of modern Greeks as not having not even a single \u201cdrop of true and unmixed Hellenic blood\u201d while the Golden Dawn is so confident in the purity of their \u201cHellenic blood\u201d that they only want blood donations from other supposedly \u201cpure\u201d Hellenes. I suppose both sides will be outraged to hear that \u201cGreek blood\u201d objectively isn\u2019t a thing. It does not exist, it has never existed, and it never will exist. Biologically speaking, there is absolutely nothing that makes someone inherently a \u201cGreek.\u201d \u201cGreek\u201d is a national identity and, like all national identities, it is a social construct. There\u2019s nothing that makes blood from a Greek person any inherently different from the blood of a Turkish person, an Albanian person, or a Slavic person. I\u2019m sure people will object that, while there may not be such a thing as \u201cGreek blood,\u201d there is such a thing as \u201cGreek DNA.\u201d This belief, however, is also mostly incorrect. One of the most common misconceptions about DNA is the idea that all members of a certain national group share certain genes in common and that people who aren\u2019t in the national group have different genes. In reality, things are more complicated than that. First of all, all humans on the planet are approximately 99.99% genetically identical. Only an extremely tiny percentage of all genes actually vary from person to person. Those genes that do vary from person to person, however, actually vary drastically within every population. In fact, there is usually far greater genetic diversity within any single given population from any given part of the world than there is between two different populations from two different parts of the world. This tremendous genetic diversity within populations is actually a good thing, because greater genetic diversity within a population makes it more likely that the population will be able to effectively adapt to changing circumstances. Nonetheless, the fact that populations are so diverse makes it impossible to speak of \u201cGreeks\u201d as a collective possessing any particular genes, since all people\u2014including all Greeks\u2014have different genes.  ABOVE: Photograph from Wikimedia Commons of venous blood (upper) and arterial blood (lower). \u201cGreek blood\u201d isn\u2019t a real thing. How DNA really works Now, there are some DNA sequences known as \u201cgenetic markers\u201d that usually tend to be associated with people whose ancestors came from certain general regions of the world, but these markers are not very exact. A DNA test can tell you based on certain genetic markers that an individual probably has some kind of ancestors who lived at some point in the general region of southeastern Europe, but it can\u2019t tell you whether any of those ancestors were classical Greeks. Furthermore, these genetic markers are not even always 100% reliable, since the same mutation can have occurred in multiple places at different times. For instance, the MTHFR C677T mutation is a genetic marker that is common in people of Mexican ancestry, but also in people Chilean, Chinese, and Italian ancestries. It\u2019s also less commonly found in other populations of people from all over the world, including western Europe, Britain, Ireland, and Colombia. If a geneticist looks at someone\u2019s DNA and finds they have the MTHFR C677T mutation, they have no way of knowing whether the person carrying that gene inherited it from a person of Italian ancestry, a person of Chinese ancestry, a person of Mexican ancestry, or some other person from some other part of the world who just happened to have the mutation. This is the case with many genetic markers. In many cases, the marker itself is present in people from all different populations from all over the world, but it happens to be particularly common in people from a certain part of the world. Unfortunately, the idea that DNA testing can tell you your exact ancestry is an idea that has been irresponsibly promoted by companies like 23andMe and Ancestry.com. Advertisements produced by these companies often show people with pie charts showing that a certain percent of their DNA comes \u201cfrom\u201d some region or another. If you actually take one of these DNA tests, they will give you your own pie chart. This simplistic way of presenting the data is deeply misleading and serves to reinvigorate a lot of old, debunked racialist ideas. The reality is that DNA tests can tell you some very basic information about the general part of the world that some of your ancestors probably come from, but, when it comes down to exact percentages, they are highly unreliable. When a company tells you that you are a certain percent \u201cfrom\u201d a certain region, what they really mean is that that percentage of the genetic markers they identified within your larger genome are often associated with members of a reference group composed of people with known ancestry in that part of the world. These tests can be helpful if you really don\u2019t know which part of the world your ancestors come from, but they really can\u2019t tell you anything specific with a high degree of accuracy. For more information here is a fairly recent article from Vox talking about the limitations of DNA ancestry tests as well as some of the ways DNA companies can mislead people through their overly simplistic presentations of data.  ABOVE: Screenshot from an advertisement for a DNA ancestry test from Ancestry.com, showing a man looking surprised to find out \u201c52%\u201d of his DNA comes from \u201cIreland, Scotland, and Wales.\u201d What that percentage really means is that 52% of the genetic markers the analysts found in his DNA are often associated with reference populations of people with known ancestry in that part of the world. The problem as it applies to the question at hand Now, DNA ancestry tests are already not especially reliable when it comes to determining the exact ancestry of living people, but they get even more unreliable when it comes to the relationship between entire populations of living people and entire populations of people who have been dead for centuries. Most DNA ancestry tests like the ones offered by companies like 23andMe and Ancestry.com rely on large reference populations of living people with reliably documented ancestries. This means they are working with what is essentially the most reliable and detailed data available. We don\u2019t have anything even remotely approaching that level of reliability or detail when it comes to the genetic composition of the population of ancient Greece. When it comes to the DNA of the ancient Greeks, all we have is DNA collected from a handful of remains that happen to be well-preserved. In most cases, we know next to nothing about the ancestry of the people from whom this DNA is collected and we don\u2019t know if these people are truly representative of the overall population, but their DNA is quite literally the only DNA we have to work with. In many cases, the DNA collected from these sets of remains may not be in very good condition or it may be fragmentary. The information we have about ancient Greek genetics, then, isn\u2019t especially good to say the least. This is the reason why it is possible to have one DNA study that claims to show that modern Greeks are extremely closely related to ancient Greeks and another DNA study that claims to show that modern Greeks have little genetic relationship whatsoever to ancient Greeks. Our data is just all-around not very good. My point here is that anytime you see any kind of study based on DNA collected from any kind of remains from any kind of ancient people, you should always take the results of that study with a huge pinch of salt. I\u2019m not going to say that these studies are entirely useless, but they are the sort of thing we should be very careful in dealing with.  ABOVE: Photograph from Forbes of the skeleton of an ancient Greek athlete on display in Taranto, Italy. When people talk about ancient Greek DNA, they\u2019re talking about DNA extracted from human remains, such as skeletons. We don\u2019t normally know very much about the ancestry of the individuals DNA is collected from or their representativeness of the broader population. Nationality\u2014a cultural, not biological phenomenon Ultimately, a person\u2019s genetic ancestry is really irrelevant to the question of national identity. People are the ones who decide whether someone is \u201cGreek\u201d or \u201cTurkish\u201d or \u201cAlbanian\u201d or \u201cSlavic\u201d\u2014not genetics. We may like to pretend that nationality is about ancestry and genes and so forth, but the reality is that national identity is purely a cultural phenomenon. If someone has lived in Greece their whole life, they speak the Greek language as their native tongue, they identify themself as \u201cGreek,\u201d they feel a strong sense of kinship with other Greeks, and they are a part of Greek culture, then, frankly, who (apart from the racists and Neo-Nazis out there) really gives a care in the world whether their distant ancestors came to Greece four hundred years ago and weren\u2019t around when classical Athens was at its height in the fifth century BC? That person is Greek, regardless of their ancestry. The funny thing is that at least some people in ancient Greece actually realized this. The ancient Athenian rhetorician Isokrates (lived 436 \u2013 338 BC) writes in his Panegyrikos, section 50: \u201c\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u2019 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd \u1f21 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u1f65\u03c3\u03b8\u2019 \u03bf\u1f31 \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b7\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2.\u201d This means, as translated by George Norlin for the Loeb Classical Library: \u201cAnd so far has our city distanced the rest of mankind in thought and in speech that her pupils have become the teachers of the rest of the world; and she has brought it about that the name \u2018Hellenes\u2019 suggests no longer a race but an intelligence, and that the title \u2018Hellenes\u2019 is applied rather to those who share our culture than to those who share a common blood.\u201d In other words, according to Isokrates, those who are a part of Greek culture are Greeks\u2014regardless of their ancestry. As much as people in the United States tend to get bogged down over race, the fact that nationality is a cultural rather than biological phenomenon is something that at least progressives over here have realized for a very long time. Very few people in the United States today can trace their lineage back to the time of the Founding Fathers and prove that all their ancestors were living here when the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. Nearly all of us have ancestors who came here as immigrants, but that does not make us any less American.  ABOVE: Photograph of the Parthenon on the Athenian Akropolis. It would be silly for someone to make a law saying that, if you cannot prove all your ancestors were living in Greece at the time when the Parthenon was completed in 432 BC, then you cannot be Greek. The scale of the question Nonetheless, because people are so obsessed with question of the ancestry of modern Greeks, I will delve a bit further into this question and look at some historical evidence. Before I do, though, I want to give everyone some further impression of just how complicated this question is by illustrating just how many ancestors each person has had since the time when classical Athens was at its height. Let\u2019s assume that it takes twenty-five years for one generation to reach maturity and produce the next generation. The height of classical Athens was in the fifth century BC. Based on my assumption that a generation lasts about twenty-five years, that means approximately ninety-seven generations have passed since the year 400 BC. Each time you trace a person\u2019s ancestry further back into the past by a single generation, the number of ancestors that person has doubles. That means that, if we assume every ancestor reproduced with an individual with whom they themselves had no ancestors in common, the number of ancestors that any infant born this year in 2020 has that were alive in 400 BC would be approximately somewhere around two raised to the ninety-seventh power. It is really hard to convey just what a colossally huge number two raised to the ninety-seven power is. That number is vastly larger than the entire human population on the planet has ever been at any point in human history. It is a number so huge that it is impossible for the human mind to comprehend. Now, obviously, in reality, no one on Earth has ever had that many ancestors alive at a given time in human history because it is inevitable that at least some of their ancestors must have had the same ancestors as each other, meaning there would be a great deal of repetition in their family tree. My point, though, is that, if you went back in time to the fifth century BC to the part of the world where your ancestors came from, probably just about anyone living in that part of the world who has living descendants would be one of your ancestors. This is part of why the idea of there being a single surviving family directly descended from Jesus and Mary Magdalene\u2014an idea I debunked in this article from October 2019\u2014is so ridiculous. The fact is, if Jesus had any living descendants today, then he would almost certainly have millions of them. The same would be true for anyone else who lived in antiquity who has living descendants.  ABOVE: Diagram from the Coop Lab of Population and Evolutionary Genetics at University of California Davis showing how the number of ancestors each person has doubles each time you trace their ancestry back a single generation Greek cultural continuity Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer claimed that the ancient Greeks were totally exterminated in late antiquity and that they therefore have no living descendants, but there is no historical evidence whatsoever to support this conclusion and, in fact, this notion is wildly implausible. It is true that various non-Greek peoples have invaded and even ruled Greece since late antiquity, but we have no evidence to suggest that Greek people ever completely ceased to exist and, in fact, we have great deal of strong evidence for cultural continuity from the Greeks of the classical period to the Greeks of the present day. The only reason why people like Fallmerayer and his supporters can\u2019t see the obvious continuity from classical times into modernity is because they have such a ridiculously romanticized and inaccurate view of what ancient Greece must have been like that, in their eyes, anything other than an idyllic land where pale-skinned philosophers in himatia sit around all day debating the nature of the cosmos can\u2019t possibly truly be Greece. Greek linguistic continuity Let\u2019s start out with the most obvious example of direct cultural continuity from classical Greece to the present day: the Greek language, which, in various forms, has been continuously spoken in Greece ever since the second millennium BC. It has changed significantly since ancient times, but that\u2019s because that\u2019s what all languages do. The English language as it was spoken in the fifth century AD would be incomprehensible to any speaker of Modern English who hadn\u2019t studied Old English extensively. With Greek, the situation is not quite so drastic. Native speakers of Modern Greek can easily understand the Koine Greek of the Christian gospels, which were originally written in the late first century AD. The language does seem archaic to them, but they can understand it about as well as a Modern English speaker in the twenty-first century can understand the archaic Modern English of the King James Bible. Modern Greek speakers can likewise still understand Classical Attic Greek, albeit with more difficulty. Reading Classical Attic Greek for a Modern Greek speaker is about as difficult as reading the Middle English of Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales is for Modern English speakers; it is possible, but it is difficult and it takes a certain amount of training and practice. Classicists have long marveled at the similarities between Classical and Modern Greek. The classicist B. E. Newton writes in his paper \u201cAncient and Modern Greek,\u201d originally published in 1960: \u201cPerhaps the most amazing thing about Greek is that in the period over which our written records extend\u2014in over three millennia, since the decipherment of Linear B\u2014it has changed so little. Whereas a student of Latin would be ill-equipped to read a modern Italian newspaper, a person with a good working knowledge of classical Greek would not only find an Athenian newspaper intelligible for the most part, but would be amazed at the remarkable likenesses between the ancient and modern languages. For the vocabulary of a Greek newspaper is probably of 99 per cent. of classical origin and modern Greek has retained much of the cumbersome grammar of the ancient language\u2014and ancient Greek has got a cumbersome grammar, when we consider that its verb has over four hundred forms as compared to sixty or so in French or two in Afrikaans.\u201d It is likely that the Greek newspapers Newton was reading back in 1960 were written in Katharevousa, a deliberately archaizing form of the Greek language modeled after Classical Attic Greek that has since fallen sharply out of favor. Nonetheless, what he says here is not entirely untrue for Dimotiki, the standard form of the Greek language spoken throughout Greece today.

The Greek language has been continuously spoken in Greece ever since ancient times. Greek literary continuity Likewise, just as the Greek language itself has survived in Greece, the study of classical Greek literature, philosophy, and history has survived as well. Ancient Greek literature, philosophy, and history was widely studied by scholars in Byzantine Greece. Indeed, as I discuss in this article from January 2020, the Byzantines are primarily responsible for having copied and preserved most of the ancient Greek literary, philosophical, and historical texts that have survived to the present day. Byzantine scholars were highly engaged with the classical tradition, producing commentaries on ancient works and even their own works of literature inspired by them. Eustathios of Thessaloniki (lived c. 1115 \u2013 c. 1195 AD), the archbishop of the city of Thessaloniki in northern Greece, famously wrote extensive commentaries on the Homeric poems, incorporating a great deal of material from earlier commentaries. The twelfth-century Byzantine satirical work Timarion\u2014one of my favorite surviving Byzantine texts\u2014is about a Christian man who dies suddenly after eating a huge meal. The man discovers, to his astonishment, that paganism was true all along. He is taken by demons to the Greek Underworld, where he finds the dead are being judged by ancient Greek kings and philosophers. He is gratefully informed that the judges are absolutely impartial and do not discriminate against Christians.

Eustathios wrote exhaustive commentaries on the Homeric poems, which have survived to the present day. Religious continuity It has been claimed that the Byzantines and modern Greeks are totally religiously divorced from the religion of the ancient Greeks, but it is actually rather uncanny the extent to which aspects of Greek Orthodox Christianity resembles ancient Greek religion. Most noticeably, the veneration of cult images of deities was central to ancient Greek religion just as the veneration of icons of saints and holy figures is central to Greek Orthodoxy today. As I talk about in this article from March 2019, in late antiquity, the traditional roles and attributes of many Greek deities were given to Christian saints. For instance, the Virgin Mary came to fill the role of the ancient Greek virgin warrior goddess Athena. One of the most remarkable examples is a Greek account from the seventh century AD of how, when the city of Constantinople was under siege by the Avars, the Virgin Mary appeared on the ramparts of the city, dressed in full battle armor and brandishing a spear, urging the people to fight. Demeter, the ancient Greek goddess of the harvest, was still worshipped at Eleusis in Attika as late as the nineteenth century under the name \u201cSaint Dimitra.\u201d The British traveler Richard Chandler visited Eleusis in around 1765 and wrote an account of how the locals claimed that Saint Dimitra protected the harvest and that she had a daughter who had been abducted by a malevolent Turk. It is impossible to imagine that this story is anything but a genuine remembrance of the ancient story of the abduction of the goddess Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, by Hades, the god of the Underworld. In many cases, even the buildings used for worship remained the same. During the period of late antiquity, ancient Greek temples were converted into Christian churches. The Parthenon, originally constructed in the fifth century BC as a temple to the Greek goddess Athena Parthenos, was converted into a church of Parthenos Maria\u2014the virgin Mary. Likewise, the Temple of Hephaistos in the Athenian Agora was converted into a church to Saint Georgios Akamates and remained as such until after the founding of the modern Greek nation-state.  ABOVE: Modern photograph of the Acropolis of Eleusis, with a chapel to the Virgin Mary atop the hill A continuous Greek national identity There has even been a continuous national identity of some kind that has existed for Greek people since antiquity. For most of the early part of their history, the Byzantines did not usually call themselves \u201c\u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\u201d (H\u00e9ll\u0113nes), or \u201cGreeks\u201d since the term \u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 was inextricably associated with paganism; instead they usually called themselves \u201c\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9\u201d (Rh\u014dma\u00eeoi), or \u201cRomans.\u201d Nonetheless, from the way the term \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 is used in Byzantine texts, it is fairly clear that, at least in most cases, this term specifically referred to Greek Romans, since non-Greek peoples living in the Byzantine Empire such as Slavs, Vlachs, and Armenians weren\u2019t generally considered \u201c\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9.\u201d The Byzantines also sometimes called themselves \u201c\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u201d (Graiko\u00ed), a Latinizing term for speakers of the Greek language roughly equivalent to the English word Graecians. The use of the word \u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 as an ethnic term rather than as a generic word for \u201cpagans\u201d was actually revived in the Byzantine Empire in around the eleventh century. The Byzantine princess and historian Anna Komnene (lived 1083 \u2013 1153 AD), for instance, repeatedly refers to the Byzantines as \u201c\u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\u201d in the ethnic sense. Later Byzantine writers use the term \u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 similarly as a name for the Greek-speaking Christians of the Roman Empire, showing that many Byzantines from the Komnenian Period onwards saw themselves as Hellenes, Christians, and Romans and that these terms were thought of as compatible with each other.  ABOVE: Photograph of a twelfth-century AD Byzantine manuscript of Anna Komnene\u2019s Alexiad, in which she repeatedly describes the Byzantines as \u201cHellenes\u201d in the ethnic sense Ironically, even though there had continuously been speakers of the Greek language in Greece calling themselves \u201c\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9\u201d as well as sometimes \u201c\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u201d or even \u201c\u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\u201d from antiquity all the way up to Fallmerayer\u2019s own time, Fallmerayer insisted that the Byzantines and later Greeks were neither Greeks nor Romans, but rather some other people. He saw the Byzantines not only as non-Roman, but the exact opposite of everything the Romans stood for, which is, of course, a blatant mischaracterization. Given the fact that Greek-speaking people with some form of Greek identity have continuously existed in Greece ever since antiquity, statistically speaking, it seems almost impossible that a person whose ancestors come from Greece could not have any ancestors whatsoever who were living in Greece during classical times. Quite simply, it seems almost inevitable that the vast majority of Greeks must have at least some ancient Greek ancestors. At the same time, it is almost statistically impossible that anyone could be solely descended from ancient Greeks. There have been all kinds of different national groups that have settled in Greece over the years and intermingled with the native population. Thus, it seems inevitable that every Greek person must have at least some ancestors who came from outside of Greece at some point. The exact numbers of ancestors from outside of Greece are not knowable and, in any case, would vary drastically from person to person.  ABOVE: Scene of everyday agricultural workers from an eleventh-century Byzantine Greek manuscript of the gospels The ancient Greeks: already \u201cmixed\u201d Clearly, the evidence indicates that Greek people did not go extinct in late antiquity and that the vast majority of people whose ancestors come from Greece probably have a substantial number of ancestors who lived in Greece in ancient times. At the same time, however, anyone with ancestors from Greece almost certainly also has ancestors who came to Greece from the outside at some point since antiquity. Now, the racial purists out there will try to insist that this means modern Greeks are not \u201cpure\u201d and are therefore not \u201ctrue Greeks.\u201d The problem is that a person being Greek has never really been about them having \u201cpure\u201d Greek ancestry. Indeed, the ancient Greeks themselves were certainly not \u201cpure\u201d in any sense. We have abundant evidence that Greek civilization arose from a melding of Indo-European-speaking proto-Greeks, who arrived in Greece from the north, and non-Indo-European-speaking pre-Greek peoples, who lived in the Balkan Peninsula long before the linguistic ancestors of the classical Greeks arrived. When these cultures melded, the populations doubtlessly interbred. The use of the word \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (Hell\u0113nik\u00f3s) to mean \u201cGreek\u201d did not arise until long after the proto-Greek and pre-Greek populations had intermingled and interbred to such an extent that the distinction between them had been completely lost. In other words, Greeks were already thoroughly \u201cmixed\u201d before they even started calling themselves \u201cGreeks\u201d to begin with. The entire concept of \u201cracial purity\u201d is ridiculous and meaningless because no \u201cpure race\u201d has never existed at any point in human history. If modern Greeks are not true Greeks because they have non-Greek ancestors, then the classical Greeks weren\u2019t true Greeks either.  ABOVE: Photograph of the reconstructed \u201cPrince of the Lilies\u201d fresco from Knossos. The Minoans, who made this fresco originally, were a pre-Greek people whose culture thrived in the Aegean 3,500 years ago. When proto-Greeks arrived in Greece, they doubtlessly interbred with peoples like the Minoans. Conclusion There are strands of direct cultural continuity from ancient Greece to modern Greece and there can be no doubt that the vast majority of people of Greek ancestry today have at least some ancestors who lived in Greece in ancient times. The Greek nation has never at any point been wiped out and replaced with a new population. New populations have come and settled in Greece over the course of the past 2,400 years, but they certainly did not wipe out the earlier inhabitants of the region. Nonetheless, it is essential to emphasize here that modern Greeks certainly are not at all \u201cracially pure\u201d in the way that Golden Dawn supporters and other Greek right-wingers like to pretend. So-called \u201cracial purity\u201d does not exist. It\u2019s not a real thing; it\u2019s totally made up. Nationality is a cultural phenomenon, not a biological one. Furthermore, with every nation, if you trace its history back far enough, you can find that it inevitably arose from the intermingling of earlier nations. It is perfectly natural for people of different ethnic backgrounds to intermingle and produce offspring together. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it.

            "answer_text": "Are modern Greeks related to Ancient Greeks? No. Let's begin with why. Mainland Greeks have difference genetics than the Island Greeks. This all began in the Middle Ages when they diverged. Why? Well let's start with the early Middle Ages when the Slavs began to migrate 6\u20137th century. As you can see on this map below many Slavs moved to the Mainland Greek areas. They mixed with the locals likely and thus the genetics of the Mainland Greeks began to diverged a bit.  In spite of this, many geneticists saw that Albanians and Mainland Greeks are the most related. This can further be backed up by the Arvanites a large group of Tosk Albanians (south Albanians) of Orthodox Christian faith who migrated into Greek during much of the Middle Ages under grant from the Byzantine Empire.  The Arvanites began to establish two distinct communities. The first was a Despotate called the Despotate of Arta, which was ruled by an Orthodox Albanians loyal to the Byzantine Emperor. The other communities moved further south establishing Arvanites villages around the city of Athens. As a result, many of the local Greeks who died from the Black Plague or the remaining locals intermixed with the Albanian settlers, thus repopulating the lands. So a few Slavs migrated in the 7th century and Albanians migrated into the 11\u201313th centuries. But another Latin group called the Aromanians also migrated into Greece in the 11th century in the city of Janina (a city once known for its larger Albanian and Vlach population). This further increases the admixture of the those said people. Lastly, the Turks arrived in the 14\u201315th centuries and several Greeks and Turks mixed. This is mostly appearant in the Thrace region only. According to this article: Mainland, island Greeks genetically diverged in Middle Ages this perfectly explains how the Albanians, being the biggest impact on mainland Greek genetics played the biggest role in shaping up how mainland Greeks are mostly of Arvanitic/Albanian origins based on genetics. Granted, majority of the Arvanites has assimilated into Greek society much of the younger population no longer speak the language. In spite of that, Arvanites did play a big role in shaping up the modern Greek state. So yes, Mainland Greeks are mostly of Albanian backgrounds, while islander Greeks are different. Because of their more isolated location, islander Greeks kept their genetics largely intact. Cypriot Greeks for instance have different genetics than their mainland counterparts. So are Greeks of today related to ancient Greeks? No. Not the Mainland ones but islander Greeks? Sure. The islander Greeks share a lot of genetics with their Southern Italian counterparts. And the diversion of genetics between the Mainland and islander during the Middle Ages confirms this. Culture also can confirm this. The Fustanella originates from southern Albania, as the root word \u201cfustan\u201d means dress in the Tosk Albanian dialect. From what I've observed a lot of Islander Greeks also tend to wear baggy clothing while the mainland Greeks wear the fustanella (could be wrong). The fustanella was an Arvanitic origin, which further originated by Southern Albanians.  Because this question asks about genetics, mainland Greeks are a mixture of people. Cypriot also mixed with Arabs and Turks. Mainland are a mixture of Slavs, Albanians, Vlachs, and Turks. Islander Greeks due to isolation didn't mix as often as their mainland counterparts. ",

            "answer_text": "before answering I have to thank all of the users above and bellow, who indicated the recent study, which implies a 70% genetic overlap between modern Greeks with ancient mycaeneans (I guess even more with later invaders like dorians) but what i have noticed, is, some users from countries that are part of balkans and the near East, with much, much audacity, and obviously with zero sources (as always), claim things about Greek history that not even the worst science fiction series' director would imagine. so let's debunk their views, with evidence: -Atilla Cengiz \u201c1829, foundation of Greece, Arvanites, around 1 million\u201d so, one million of Greeks in 1832, the total population of the country, were Arvanites. Fine, then I guess Johann Georg von Hahn who visited this part of Greece in 1854 and found Arvanites to count 158.000 in a total of 1.096.810 population of Greece was blind, and quora user \"Attila Cengiz\" and other similar internet warriors know the truth. whatever :D no comments about the rest, the \"Christian orthodox\" from Anatolia, in All sources, are referred as predominantly Greek speakers, at least 70% of them, and the Greek identity of Western Anatolia and Pontus is very well known, since people like Thales of Miletus were from there -Ahmet Egesoy \"Did you know that Sultan Abdul hamit 2nd had banned Albanian language in Greece so as to protect the Greek culture from going extinct? Most people that consider themselves as Greeks today in reality have Albanian ancestors (they would deny it and hate it but true).\" with only problem to the theory of the particular user, being that Sultan Abdul hamit 2nd was born in 1842, 10 years after the establishement of Greek kingdom, and became a Sultan in 1876, which indicates How much he and his decisions were related to Greece, and rather the particular decision refers to Albania which he ruled, as an Ottoman sultan, not independent Greece, which he simply did not control: Abdul Hamid II - Wikipedia In previous centuries Albanian language was considered a dominant language in the ottoman empire, after Turkish of course, as its speakers were predominantly muslims, therefore, ottomans themselves Not to mention that Greece includes parts that have never been Ottoman,see Ionian islands, Mani and Agrafa. As for the rest of the claims of the particular user, they are responded bellow, as another user (this time Albanian) claims similar things: -Krenar Shqiptar \"According to this article: Mainland, island Greeks genetically diverged in Middle Ages this perfectly explains how the Albanians, being the biggest impact on mainland Greek genetics played the biggest role in shaping up how mainland Greeks are mostly of Arvanitic/Albanian origins based on genetics.\" the problem is that the article itself, which I doubt if he has even read, NEVER SAYS THAT THIS CONNECTION HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH ALBANIAN IMMIGRATION IN GREECE, it rather notes slavic invasions in mainland Greece and Albania, which seperated these two areas from the aegean islands (and especially the second one). In other words, the article says that all four populations, Greek mainlanders, Greek islanders, South Italians and Albanians used to share nearly the same genetic background before slavic invasions as natives in South Europe, but slavic invasions affected only Greek mainland and Albania but not the islands or south Italy , making these 2 populations to get slightly seperated from Greek islanders and South Italians, but not terribly different. however, the article has been criticised for two main reasons: 1) the sample it used,c from the \"islands\" was only from South dodecanese, being called \"anatolian islands\" in the original article, which in other studies and individual Gedmatch results are shown to be the biggest genetic outliers of Greece because of extra near eastern admixture in them 2) it used samples from Calabria, meanwhile Apulia and Abruzzo are genetically closer to Greece than Calabria is, due to also extra near eastern imput in calabria the majority of the islands (northern Aegean, Sporades, Cyclades etc) are genetically closer to mainland Greece than Albania is, which possibly means that it's rather an extra prehistoric near eastern admixture in Dodecanese themselves seperating these islands from the mainland, rather than slavic invasions in the mainland (which of course also worked, but not so much to separate mainland, which was always a bit different from dodecanese (mind that these differences are like 10%) \"So yes, Mainland Greeks are mostly of Albanian backgrounds, while islander Greeks are different.\" Says the particular genius, which is nothing but the particular user's wishful thinking of course, as we previously saw, racially the vast majority of mainlanders have nothing in common with modern Albanians, and any connection is as early as neolithic, with some common Slavic impact. Albanians, whenever emigrated to Greece, colonized, specific, isolated areas and were not intermarried with native \"Greek-speakers\", and always made up a small minority, known today as arvanites. In all articles of the early Greek kingdom, the arvantic (christian Albanian speaking population of Greece) is hardly shown to represent 9%-13% of Southern Greece, which means hardly 5% of the country (an author of 1854 was referred above). add to this the fact that they rarely intermarried with natives and you easily conclude that they didn't even affect Greece racially, this is implied by anthropological studies as well, Albanians are presented as one of the most brachycephalic populations of Europe, with predominant types being dinaric and then Alpine, meanwhile, Greeks, the opposite, are predominantly mediterranean, and half of their population is dolichomesocephalic, which means with more similar looks even to Spanish and Portuguese than to Albanians (Not even mention South Italians who are pretty close in terms of both looks and DNA): Random Albanian males, brachycephalic, dinaric and Alpine:    Random Greeks, dolichomesocephal, predominantly Mediterranean:    if the admixture that the particular user dreams of existed, it would reflect on racial types, something that doesn\u2019t happen. and genetically, in spite of the geographical distance of the two countries, being next-door, which means that neolithic genetic similarities are unavoidable, their genetic distance is enormous, as it's nearly the same distance as the genetic distance between German and irish in Gedmatch, and, I repeat, excluding Dodecanese, which were tested in this article and have extra near Eastern influence,most of Aegean islands are genetically closer to mainland Greece than Albania is to mainland Greece Any genetic connection between Greece and Albania in general is neolithic, and any further connection between Albania and mainland Greece in particular is related to the common proportions of Slavic admixture in these two countries, not with any admixture of Greeks with Albanians, excluding linguistic minorities. \"Culture also can confirm this. The Fustanella originates from southern Albania, as the root word \u201cfustan\u201d means dress in the Tosk Albanian dialect. From what I've observed a lot of Islander Greeks also tend to wear baggy clothing while the mainland Greeks wear the fustanella (could be wrong). The fustanella was an Arvanitic origin, which further originated by Southern Albanians.\" neither culture confirms such a thing, and even more neither fustanella does. fustanella's name is Italian, and its origins are unknown, and it's not considered settled that it has Albanian origins. but even if it has, wearing fustanella is far from being an evidence of Albanian roots of someone, and especially when most of mainlanders didn't even wear fustanella before 1830. Fustanella was worn by particular \"warrior classes\" of Klephts and Armatoloi, most of whom were not even of Arvanitic origins, and the rest of the mainland population in their own towns and villages in fact were wearing things similar to the \"baggy clothing\" of the islands, a Byzantine/medieval frankish and venetian kind of breeches known as vrakka, while others were just wearing trousers:   And these kinds of costumes are not terribly different from particular parts of Sardinia and South Italy:   and northern Balkans, where black bolero with shirt and some kind of trousers is always common  not to mention that they are not terribly different from those in the Greek islands:    Albania on contrary along with south Balkans often differs from this aspect:  neither the rest of Greek culture (with the exception of specific areas very close to Albania) has much to do with the nearby Balkan country. A striking example, is architecture. the architecture of South mainland Greece has much more to do with South Italy and sometimes Spain     meanwhile Albanian architecture is a balkan and ottoman mix  \"Mainland are a mixture of Slavs, Albanians, Vlachs, and Turks.\" the admixture with Turks is already debunked above, it was impossible due to religion, and Albanians should be first to \"worry\" about Turkish admixture, not only because of their common religion with Turks, but because of the fact that they were for 1,5 century longer under Turkish occupation than Greeks did, and because in contrast to Greece, which has parts that never were part of the ottoman empire, Albania was as a whole Ottoman. the admixture with Albanians was debunked above, and vlachs do not even exist South of Lamia,they lived in northern Greece, like thessaly epirus etc. The only people who really were assimilated in all parts of mainland are slavs, and in most of South mainland Franks and north Italians (who, in a weird way are always ignored by Balkan anti-Greeks) I would also suggest Georgia Marliakou's answer to Why isn't Greece usually considered a Balkan country together with (former Yugoslavian countries) Albania and Bulgaria?

            "answer_text": "Although Modern Greeks do have some of their genetic heritage inevitably from the Ancient Greeks, as do Turks, South Italians, and Levant people, and do speak a language descended from Ancient Greek language, they are a different people than the Ancient Greeks and uninterrupted continuation is a modern myth created by the British and Germans in the 19th Century. In fact Greek nation as it is now called was artificially synthesized in the 19th Century as such a nation did not exist for over a thousand years and a half. At the start of Alexander the Great\u2019s conquests, there was an Ancient Greek nation, separate from others, with own heritage, culture and customs, the Hellenes. During Alexander and different states established in vast areas, Anatolia, Egypt, Levant, even as far as Iraq and Iran. There was mass Hellenisation and adoption of Greek as a prestige language of those ruling elites. Greek language became the common language of all the ancient civilised world commonly known as the Middle East or the Near East when Greece and the Balkans added. When Romans took over the Eastern territories, Greek was the common language of Anatolia, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Greece, Macedonia and Thrace. There were competing common languages such as Aramaic but they were not as widespread as Greek. Ancient Greek had become simplified and modified as it became a common language. But Romans adopted it as the language of communication and trade in the Eastern territories. Roman citizens started to speak Greek, the universal language of the Roman Empire in the East, more widespread than Latin and it rose as the language of choice especially by the elites. But these citizens of Rome called themselves Romans, Rumoi, rather than Hellenes. Then Christianity was adopted as the state religion, and the New Testament was also in common Greek language. All Romans were encouraged to adopt Christianity which had services and prayers in Greek in the eastern territories. All people of Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and the Balkans people were by now speaking Greek language, practicing Christianity and calling themselves Romans, Rumoi. Few Rumoi were of Hellenic background although all of them somehow had Hellenic ancestors as well as Latin, Anatolian, Persian, Semitic, llyrian, Egyptian, Celtic, Slavic, Caucasian or Turkic. Rumoi, even in the traditional Ancient Greek lands, completely forgot everything about Ancient Greek culture and religion. It was a sin to even mention old. Greek gods. Old but intact temples such as Parthenon were long converted to churches. Some myths remained in some islands or remote communities as fairy tales and folk stories but stories were now on Jesus and his disciples. Nor anybody remembered anything from the Ancient Greek heroes or scientists or philosophers, who were pagan enemies of the faith anyway. That knowledge belonged to the Muslims. Nor did anybody saw themselves as Hellenic. Roman was the identity and the language was Greek. Just as Americans speaking English, some of whom are from English heritage, but are not English. Yet Americans are much closer to English than Modern Greeks are to Ancient Greeks because American and English culture and religion are almost the same. With Modern Greeks and Ancient Greeks it is more like Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan with another 1500 years separation and much more linguistic difference outside mutually intelligible. Then the Turks came. Muslim Turks ended Roman Empire and started a new state within Christian Orthodox Church and Romans in it. The church represented all Romans, called by the Turks as the Rum, that followed the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Nobody including themselves called the Rum Hellenes. Many upper class Romans and landowners converted to Islam, starting from 11th century up to early 20th century. That was much easier for richer people to convert to Islam, especially outside Istanbul, because the Turks preferred joining of the ruling class among themselves, gave them advantages, and the rich depended less on the social support of the community and the church. It was much easier to convert then. More like change of political affiliation. A Roman who converted was called a Turk, even if he kept on speaking Greek as native language. By the Enlightenment and the start of Romanticism Europeans started to see themselves as a separate and superior people, a race of natural rulers of the world with a right to decide annihilation of entire peoples, decided by a factor in their organism, blood or something similar. They also were fascinated with popularised Ancient Greek literature, religion and philosophy. They believed the Rumoi, who spoke Greek, but have nothing remaining from those Ancient Greeks, are the descendants of the Ancient Greeks and can be reverted back to that so-called racially superior people who started the Western Civilisation. They started teaching Rumoi living in Ottoman territories that they are in fact the lost Ancient Greeks, that they should learn their forgotten heroes, their old gods, their philosophers and poets, recite them and return to glory, instead of being slaves to a nation, the Turks, who were losing the conflict against Europe anyway. Day after day the Russians were causing Turks heavy losses. That weird idea did not catch up in more affluent and urbane areas of the Ottoman Empire. But in Morea, or the Peloponnese, the poorest and most distant area of the Empire, it did. People started to call themselves the Hellenes, they organised for freedom from the yoke and started fighting. Istanbul Rum looked down on these peasants following crazy Europeans with disgust. The patriarchate were apologising about these hopeless bandits. The uprising was put down. But English, French and Russian navies burned down the Turkish navy and forced Turkey to concede Peloponnese. Turks did not think that distant place which had been so many times lost and reconquered mattered much. Hellenic Kingdom was found. It captured Athens. Especially the Bavarian royal family was involved in the establishment of new Greece. A Bavarian king was made King of the Hellenes. New Greece was ethnically cleansed from Turkish landowners and urban elites, mostly Greek speaking Muslims who might be the closest to the Ancient Greeks. Athens mosques and Parthenon\u2019s minaret were destroyed. As neoclassical buildings rose, the Arian race also rose too in their eyes. Not every Rumoi, members of the Orthodox Church were Greek speakers in Peloponnese and Attica. Many and the fiercest freedom fighters were Albanian speakers. Many Slavic and Latin speaking communities also existed. All these people were gradually forced to forget their language and own culture under a national education with Greek language and identity teaching schools. They were taught, for the first time after a millennium and a half, the Ancient Greek religion and culture. A new nation was being synthesised. Now that a completely new nation was created out of nowhere, which called themselves Hellenes, and were called by Europeans as Greeks, the Turks had to find a name for them themselves. They checked ancient documents and found that Persian sources referred to the nation predating Romans as Yunan. Hence Yunan nation was established in the Turkish mind too. Turks of 19th Century, like the Rumoi, did not question the absolute authority of the West Europeans in everything. This development did not go unnoticed among other Rumoi peoples, or members of the Rum Millet, followers of the Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople, who were also mostly Greek speakers. This was the way to be free and be the rulers in your own territory. Project Turn Romans to Greeks gradually caught up. Ancient myths and independence songs taught young generation Greek identity. It took nearly one hundred years to take most of the Rumoi people learn that they are now the Greeks. Military success, expansion of the new Hellenic army and stories of a rich Greek state ready to expand over the dying Turks in Anatolia encouraged the Rumoi, even those who spoke Turkish or Arabic as native speakers. Even those who were ethnic Turks who converted to Orthodox Christianity much before the Ottomans. After bloody wars and the population exchange between Turkey and Greece, all remaining Orthodox people of Anatolia moved to Greece in 1925, treated a bit second class citizens tactically, had to learn Greek as spoken in the new Greece, learn all the Ancient Greece package and feel like the new Greeks. All the Orthodox Albanians, Slavs, Caucasians, Latins and Turks were strictly assimilated to the new identity. So a nation was forged from old Roman citizens of the East under the name Greeks in a new country called Greece believing that they never ceased to exist as the Greeks. A very imposing education system intolerant of any ethnic discord ensured the success of the project, together with tales. Those tales told that some Greeks cannot speak Greek because Turks had banned language, religion and all ancient culture of the chosen nation of Greeks \u2014 but secretly in underground bunkers they continued learning Greek language, culture and identity. Actually many Greek friends when I was a student believed those secret bunker-school myths. In fact during Ottomans there was Greek language printing houses, newspapers for Rumoi, Greek language schools, Rumoi governors and ministers, even many Sultans spoke Greek, Rumca. Mehmed II was into Homeros. An ambitious Anglo-German experiment and was it bad? Probably not. Did it create a free nation out of nowhere? It did. Are the citizens of Greece gathered in the Greek borders uninterrupted continuation of the Ancient Greeks? No, they are not more than a Lebanese, Slavic Macedonian, Bulgarian, Calabrian or West Anatolian. Can they claim Ancient Greeks as theirs? Yes, they can because they live in that land, speak a language similar, play Ancient Greeks, name street names after long lost Ancient Greek characters, and learn the Ancient Greek culture even if from a Western designed perspective. So, yes, they are related. Culturally and artificially.  Otto of Bavaria, first King of the Hellenes EDIT: Please refer to Kutluk's answer to Are there any examples of Greek or Armenian substrate influence onto the Turkish language? Anatolia was very populated, and most Turks descend from ancient Anatolians. Didn't they leave any trace of their former pre-Turkic languages? EDIT: Instead of name calling during the past year and insults (many deleted), dear Greek quorans, kindly present a document from the Roman Empire 395\u20131453 in Greek that calls its Greek speaking citizens Greeks or Hellenes or Elliniki or Yunan or anything other than Roman, Rumoi, Rum. (This is like the American president calling his citizens, O Englishmen because the language is English). Not what the western empire or the impostor Holy Roman Empire or the Pope or the Crusaders called them. They called them Greek not to call them Roman. What they called themselves. There are countless documents, inscriptions, writings, mosaics. Surely there has to be a reference to a Greek Nation, We the Tribes of Hellenes something somewhere. No? Well maybe you now realise you are an invented (or transformed) nation in the early 19th century from the true and historic nation of Rumoi because German and British romantics decided you so. Wake up. You are descendants of Romans not the Greeks. Which is not a bad thing at all. ",

            "answer_text": "I do think that modern Greeks are related to the ancient ones. Needless to say, after so many generations passed, all (European people specifically, as I don't know enough for other continents) people have common DNA with most civilizations, from Greek to Roman, to Carthaginian (Phoenician), Celtic... to a 12% or so Neanderthal, really. But the closest match to the ancient Greeks are the current inhabitants of the area, modern Greeks, as DNA studies show. Our language is quite similar; I'm not familiar with ancient Greek, yet I can read them, and understand what they say. I might not recognize a few words, but I understand what is written. And the same goes for the ancient Greeks; On a trip to Belgium, I happened to meet with a professor on ancient Greek, from a French university. English were fine, but he asked me if I wanted to give it a try; him, not knowing modern Greek, and me not knowing ancient Greek, to communicate using these \"two\" Greek languages. We did understood each other, but it was really funny, I imagine it was like two drunk-wasted strangers trying to understand each other speaking the same language, still, it worked. Cuisine is pretty much the same. Yes, we do have pepper, potatoes and tomatoes now, but that doesn't make a huge difference. As for both culture and religion, the religion has nothing to do with the ancient one, even the ones who try to revive it (no matter how much they try, in an Abrahamic religion background, it's impossible to work), the religion was the death of our culture. In fact, the religion made it its primary goal to replace our culture; every ancient Dodecatheist holiday got replaced with a modern one, except from the Carnival, and on that, religion is still trying to make it look like something evil, a remnant of our beastly nature which should be avoided at all costs. Our, and other eastern and western Gods became demons in their books, saints got the same superpowers ancient Gods had etc. I still remember Saturday-Sunday church schools hearing stories about \"super evil carnivals where the father was killing his son because he was wearing his mask while I was thinking \"what the heck, why should someone kill someone, masks aside?\"\" and \"orgies that happen on Carnivals with mothers and sons\", where again I was wondering what the heck? Also, what's an orgy? :p Still, carnival continues to exist, and is pretty much the only cultural part that remains from ancient Greece. You could argue that language, cuisine and current appreciation of the ancient arts is part of our culture, but other than that, Abrahamic faiths, used the \"scorched culture\" tactic to insure their dominance and prosperity, with plenty of underhanded tactics, and now not only they have the monopoly on most of the world, but, even if you are trying to escape them, their way of thinking and doing things have become part of you, and even if you try to follow a different religion, you will show a lot more zeal than a \"true believer\" or someone who grew up in a society without the influence of these religions. And, a final note on the name of the country, although it might sound kind of unpatriotic; If the \"Greek\" revolution started (I need to add the word successfully) in some place in Greece other than Peloponnesus, there would be a chance that the name of our country would be a different one, but other than that, the place and people would still be the same.

            "answer_text": "Culturally and genetically, there were significant changes and foreign influences in the broad Aegean region since the Classical Antiquity with which most people associate the Ancient Greeks. Except for regions that became very isolated for a long time, most modern populations are a mix of old ethnicities. Most of the genetic input into the Greeks since Antiquity seems to be related to North/Northeast European populations, probably on account of the Slavic, Germanic and Turkic invasions into Southeastern Europe, and possibly also due to a southward movement of people fleeing those \u201cbarbarian\u201d migrations. So, Modern Greeks are almost certainly more \u201cnorthern\u201d than their forebears 2,500 years ago. However, despite the self-evident fact that, just like any other people on earth, Modern Greeks are certainly another people with a different social order, way of life and material culture, Greeks maintained a very remarkable degree of linguistic, cultural and genetic continuity with Ancient Greeks, and they\u2019re clearly the foremost descendants of the Classical Greeks. That isn\u2019t the most important factor that makes them a Hellenic nation today, because we all know that all ethnic groups, nations and states are held together mainly by culturally made fictions which give them a sense of belonging to the same community and sharing the same collective fate, even though this social glue may often be correlated to a majority of shared ancestry. If this question refers mainly to the genetics of the Modern Greeks, and not to their cultural ethos and ethnic identity, which is undeniably linked to the Ancient Greeks despite all the changes in the intervening millennia, then it is helpful to actually take a look at some objective data, and not just speculate on the basis of old and subjective texts and comparisons with art depictions. Some people make questions like these a matter of ideological and political views and muddle present-day concerns and disputes with ancient history (not a good combination), instead of treating it as a neutral scientific matter. We now have ancient DNA evidence of Ancient Greeks, whether they are the much earlier Mycenean Greeks of the Bronze Age, or some surely Hellenic colonists of the Greek colonies throughout the Mediterranean basin. All we have to is compare some Modern Greek samples to those ancient Greeks, and we\u2019ll have some approximate idea of how much they are related to the Hellenic peoples of Antiquity (I say \u201capproximate\u201d because these comparisons between modern and ancient people are not totally accurate, and because we can\u2019t be sure that the few ancient DNA samples we have are fully representative of all Ancient Greeks, for there was certainly some genetic variation between populations of different parts of Ancient Greece, especially since it was so politically decentralized). So, I tried to model the genetic ancestry of some Modern Greeks using as reference populations some ancient DNA samples from different places and cultures. The results of such a scientific experiment are telling: Average modern Greeks [1] \"distance%=1.3251 / distance=0.013251\"\u00a0 Greek\u00a0Mycenaean 30.30\u00a0Lithuania_BA 29.70\u00a0Iberia_Northeast_Empuries2 26.45\u00a0Levant_BA_South 6.40\u00a0Minoan_Lasithi 4.30\u00a0Anatolia_Ottoman 2.85\u00a0This is just a simplified and not totally accurate model, but it gives us a general picture of the ancestry of modern Greeks. Yes, they are quite mixed, and the main shift from their Mycenaean Greek past some 3,500 years ago is that they absorbed a lot of \u201cnorthern\u201d ancestry mainly related to Eastern Europeans (Lithuania_BA was used here as a proxy for ancient Balto-Slavic peoples and for Northeast European ancestry more generally). Therefore, on the contrary of what Nordicists usually claimed, the Ancient Greeks were probably an even more \u201csouthern\u201d population, similar to the modern Sicilians and Cypriots. However, at least 61% of the modern gene pool of Greeks is directly derived from the Ancient Greek DNA samples that we have found (and which may not be representative of the full regional variation of Classical Greek subgroups, especially the people of Northern Greece): 30.3% Bronze Age Mycenaean Greek + 26.45% Classical Greek colonist (Iberia_Northeast_Empuries2 is a sample from a Hellenic colony with a huge prevalence of Mycenaean-like ancestry) + 4.3% pre-Greek Minoan (Minoan_Lasithi). If we consider that Ottoman Anatolia still had a lot of Anatolian Greek ancestry, too, and that the Aegean coast of Anatolia was an integral part of the Classical Greek world, too, that percentage may become even higher, approaching 2/3 of the ancestry of the modern Greeks. The true amount of ancestry that Modern Greeks derived from Ancient Greeks may in fact range from around 60% to 70%, a very significant proportion. Nonetheless, despite all the subsequent mixing, the Modern Greeks are still closest to Classical Greeks and Myceneaean Greeks among several ancient DNA samples: [1] \"1. CLOSEST SINGLE ITEM DISTANCES\"\u00a0Iberia_Northeast_Empuries2: 0.07174857                 \u00a0Mycenaean: 0.07230412 \u00a0Italy_Medieval_Collegno: 0.07585185            \u00a0Minoan_Lasithi: 0.11149249 \u00a0Levant_Jordan_EBA_I1705: 0.15415853              \u00a0Lithuania_BA: 0.16511717 \u00a0Anatolia_Ottoman: Anatolia_Ottoman: 0.23451614         \u00a0Kazakhstan_Karluk: 0.31294536 \u00a0Whatever is the most accurate proportion of Ancient Greek ancestry in Modern Greeks, it\u2019s certain that it confirms the strong genetic relationship between the two, and the ethnic and cultural links are also very strong.

Yes [1], at least Modern Greeks are more related to Ancient Greeks than to any other ancient tribe and Ancient Greeks are more related to Modern Greeks (as well as to Southern Italians and to Turks of Aegean Turkey) than to any other currently existing ethnic group.

Our modern version of the Greek language is not that much different from the ancient one.School lessons in history, literature and philosophy cover many elements of the Ancient Greek world.Our political system is remotely similar to that of Classical Athens.Other than that?

            "answer_text": "The word \u201cgreek\u201d was not coined until the Roman conquest, which means approx. 600 years after the establishment of the ancient city states, and approx. 150 years after their conquest by the Macedonians. Thus, it is wrong to use the word \u201cancient greek\u201d, which simply did not exist 2,300 years ago. It is also a well known fact that these ancient city states were never politically united. They existed as independent entities and were in constant struggle with eachother for dominance in the region. The name \u201cgreece\u201d was imposed on the modern greek kingdom by the imperial powers of the era such as Britain, France and Russia. Even though modern greeks call themselves \u201chellenes\u201d and their country \u201chellas\u201d, these names were borrowed from the past and neither of them represented the elements of a nation or an ethnicity. By using the name \u201cgreek\u201d to refer both the archaic and modern folks, the greek state falsely implies descent and continuity from antiquity to modernity. In reality, the words \u201cgreek\u201d and \u201cgreece\u201d were popularized by the 19th century Western European authors and scholars. There are also no ancient maps or references with the words \u201cgreece\u201d or \u201chellas\u201d. Maybe the Romans made some references to the archaic folk living in Sicily as \u201cgrecos\u201d but they referred to south of Olympus as \u201cAchaia\u201d. The kingdom of greece, occupying the region of Morea and present day Peloponnesus, was created for the first time in the 19th century. Between 1829\u20131912, the greek state expanded its territory to present day greece, by occupying Epirus, Thessaly and 51% of the ethnographic Macedonia. When greece was established for the first time, its population was less than a million people, most of them being Albanians, Slavs, Vlachs and a small minority of other ethnic groups. By the time greece annexed Epirus and Thessaly, its population significantly increased. In 1907, greece registered a population of 2.6 million people. Following the annexation of Macedonia and the population exchange with Turkey, the population of greece tripled. The population makeup of greece, 1829\u20131928:  In 1928, greece registered 6.2 million people after declaring itself as \u201cethnically ho-mogenous\u201d, consisting of \u201c100% pure greeks\u201d with a very small \u201cMuslim but ethnically greek\u201d population. According to all these facts and figures, at least 16% of greece\u2019 population in 1928 was non-greek, let alone being \u201cethnically pure\u201d or being the direct descendants of the so-called \u201cancient greeks\u201d. It has been estimated that in classical times, the number of slaves in Attica was roughly equal to the number of free citizens. In Sparta, there was an even greater proportion of slaves, and most of them, the subjects, were Messenians. While the slaves of Athens were a wide racial mix and therefore less likely to unite on the basis of a common language, these Messenian subjects of Sparta all spoke the language of hellenes, and had a kind of group self-consciousness. Thus, they presented \u2018special problems of security\u2019 for their Spartan masters, whose numbers were constantly on the decline. In the case of Piso, who had been the recipient of an unhelpful decision by a vote of the Athenian city assembly, made a violent speech in which he said: \u201cThe latter-day Athenians had no right to identify themselves with the great Athenians of the past such as Pericles, Demosthenes, Aeschylus, and Plato. The ancient Athenians had been annihilated by repeated wars, massacres and these were mere mon-grels, de-generates, and the descendants of slaves. Any Roman who flattered them as if they were the legitimate heirs of those ancient heroes, was lowering the dignity of the Roman name.\u201d The ancient hellenes were, after all, of very mixed ancestry, and there can be no doubt that the \u201cByzantine\u201d greeks, both before and after the Slav occupation, were even more heterogenous. ( John Shea / The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation / Chapter 4: The Great Ethnic Mix of Greece / pp. 77\u201383\u201384-96 ) Such historical ideas make it clear that even 2,000 years ago the notion of ethnic purity amongst the so-called ancient greeks was difficult to sustain. This ethnic mix continued over the next 2,000 years. The \u201cgreekness and hellenism\u201d of the modern inhabitants of greece are a myth, and modern 19th century creations. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a problem with this question The problem with this question is that implies that \u201cGreek\u201d is something that exists. Of course as term of a country and as a term for citizens of a country or somewhat biological related to a country makes perfect sense and is definitely necessary to exist. We need titles to make communication of meanings possible. The problem is that even though we identify ourselves as Greeks or Hellines as we will like to call ourselves, there is no evidence other than terminology and personal belief that such thing does exist. You see the problem is that Greece does not contain one culture but a multitude of cultures. Of course you will argue that so do other countries. The difference is that with other countries cultures tend to merge to an extend , those cultures have happily coexisted for thousands of years. excluding of course the occasional wars and various other conflicts. The Greek national identity is a tricky one because we may identify as Greeks but the location plays an even bigger role. Take a look at my favorite island  Crete for example has its own music, its own traditions , its own cuisine , its own mentality, even its own language that is extremely different to Greek as you know it. What is even more weird, is that few dozen kms above Crete is Santorini, a tiny distance for other countries, its basically a distance between 2 suburbs in large cities and yet its another world. Santorini has its own music, cousine, traditions etc etc. This also continues for the rest of the country See the problem with the country is this  Do you see that blue thing\u2026 yeap that\u2019s water, the Aegean and Ionian Sea. See every time we talk about Greece as being one thing, one nation, one country , one everything, is easy to forget how extremely fragmented geography this weird looking country has. We are not talking here a UK situation with separation of hundreds of kms , even a few kms are enough to make a cultural difference. Because even for our modern times , with AI technology, sea is a tricky way of transport as I rediscovered recently trying to travel from Athens to Aigina , that island you see in the map very close to Athens. Especially when the weather is quite windy. Practically next to Athens and yet another world. The difficult to access geography is what has allowed the country to remain free and in relative peace for thousands of years. Out of 6000 years of known history , only 1000 are the ones that Greece was under occupation or a state of war. This includes Ottoman and Roman Greece. So to go back to your original question Are we related to Ancient Greeks ? I thinks its unavoidable to find a connection Ironically enough we can feel more connected to classical Greece because we share a very similar language Classical Greece on the other hand even looking back 1000 years would feel unrelated to a world speaking an early form of Greek known as Linear A and Linear B, vastly different to both ancient and modern Greek. How connected can the classical well known and popular Athenian , at the time of Socrates and Periklesm feel with the Atlantians. Atlantians , also known as Minoans , flourished as a civilization from 3000- 1600 BC as far as we know because a century ago we thought they were just a simple tribe and that the myth of Atlantis was a figment of very a vivid imagination. Now we know that of much of it , not all of it, is true, Minoans were destroyed by a great flooding , it did not sink the island but a 150 meter tsunami after the volcano of Thera exploded would certainly make it look like that with most cities being on the north and near the sea. Especially after we take into account there were multiple tsunamis not just one. They were also far ahead of their time, technologically and artistically and even they were in war with Athens as they dominated the lower part of the Agean. Which most likely gave rise to the myth of Minotaur. Yet we can see the large influence they had on Athenians , artistically, intellectually and scientifically. Minoans were amazing architects, master at ship making , practically invented Linear A, the early form of Greek language and the first to implement a sewage system in their palace-cities, in the entire European continent. That\u2019s only a taste of the amazing things Minoans achieved. The same can be said about Cycladic, Mycenean, Cypriotic etc civilizations that also existed around 3000 BC. They were separated by a few hundrends kms yet so obviously different. So overall any effort to oversimplify the Greek national identity is going to fail majestically. I always argued to deaf ears that Greek and nationalism cannot go hand in hand. Because in the end we are not one nation, one culture , one mind. Sure we share the same language and to an extend the same religion but that\u2019s about it. Which is a nightmare scenario for nationalistic ideologies as well as marxist ideologies. Ideologies that like to put all people together and divided them to classes, immigrants and non immigrants and essentially large groups. Yeah that does not work for Greece. Essentially you could say Greece is the exact opposite of globalization, localisation. A country of people all to happy to agree that they disagree. If you lived in Greece and you tried to make sense of the chaotic nature of the country, now you know what causes it. We can easily blame it on geography. The beauty of being Greek is that you have so many choices when it comes to culture you can embrace. I have in my \u201cblood\u201d currently 3 civilizations/cultures Athenian, Cretan and Ionian and I happen to be proud of all 3 of them. How much related are they between each other ? I don\u2019t know. They important thing is that yes they are very different and yes that\u2019s a good not a bad thing. Variety is what enrich our lives. So what kind of Greek you want to be today, Sir ? ",

            "answer_text": "I mean seriously, this is all easily researchable: \u201cIn terms of the following criteria, Culturally\u2026\u201d [sigh] \u201cAncient Greece\u201d is a very broad and vague period in Greek history spanning 2000 years (not including the pre-Greek civilizations like the Minoans), from the arrival of Greek-speaking Indo-European tribes, to the fall of Rome (4th Century AD) which is generally considered the end of antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Most non-Greeks, when they think of \u201cAncient Greece\u201d, they\u2019re thinking of the Classical period, which was only about 200 years, or about 10% of that \u201cAncient Greece\u201d period. So, it\u2019s very stupid to think of \u201cAncient Greece\u201d as this long period of cultural paralysis. Greek culture changed as much -if not more- within the ancient period, as it has between then and now. All cultures evolve over time. That said, I would argue that certain basic things have remained the same. For example, Greek gender dynamics have a high degree of matriarchy, both then and now. The way Christianity is practiced in Greece today has borrowed a lot from the ancient, pre-Christian religion. In this very matriarchal culture, the Virgin Mary took the place of female dieties like Hera, and Christian patron saints for each town/region/island/profession have taken the place of patron gods/goddesses. So, the culture has evolved, but also remained the same to a high degree. \u201cLinguistically\u2026\u201d Well duh. Yes. Modern Greek is an obvious descendant of \u201cAncient Greek\u201d. And again, there is no uniform \u201cAncient Greek\u201d. The Greek language evolved during that very long \u201cAncient\u201d period. Someone from Classical Athens around 500 BC might have trouble communicating with the original Greek-speaking tribes that arrived in Greece over 1000 years prior if they met via time machine. That said, a modern Greek-speaker can understand Koine Greek (the phase of the language spoken during the Alexander and Roman period, and in which the New Testament was written) pretty well. Classic Attic (Athenian) Greek, which Plato wrote in, would be tougher to understand. But, the modern speaker would still be able to recognize a lot of the words. Basically, many of the word roots have stayed the same, but the inflections (word endings) have changed. This is no different than say Modern English versus Shakespearean English, Middle English, Old English, and Anglo-Saxon. \u201c\u2026Genetics/DNA\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a little tiring constantly being asked this, when other countries are not held to the same standard. The answer is: to a large degree. Greeks were never a 100% homogenous group. When Greek speakers arrived from the north, they absorbed the earlier peoples (like the Minoans and Cycladic peoples), as well as the Pelasgians (the indigenous Greek mainlanders about whom we know little about). During the Middle Ages, Greece absorbed significant Slavic immigration, but that\u2019s pretty much it. There were some Germanic (Viking and Visigothic) raids in the Middle Ages, but they didn\u2019t stay in Greece. The Turks didn\u2019t try to repopulate Greece either during Ottoman rule. If anything, some Greeks became Muslims and Turkish-speaking, and those people were viewed as \u201cTurkish\u201d after Greece\u2019s independence. Today, genetic tests place Greeks closest with Italians, Serbians/Croatians, Albanians, and to a lesser degree, Spaniards and Bulgarians. Turks are not that close, but they\u2019re not that distant either; this is because Turks have a very diverse background that includes some Greek ancestry \u201cCuisine\u2026\u201d Again, it gets tiring repeating this, but the \u201cAncient\u201d period was a long period, about 2000 years long. Someone from 100 AD and someone from 500 BC and someone from 1500 BC probably ate different things, let alone someone from Athens or Thebes or Sparta or Thessaloniki or the Greek colonies in Italy, etc. That said, some cuisine staples have remained constant for 4000 years: wheat, wine, olive oil, fish, and a couple other things. New ingredients were introduced into Greece over the centuries, like tomatoes which came from the Americas and oranges which came from South Asia. \u201cReligiously\u2026\u201d I answered this under \u201ccultural\u201d. \u201cIs there any real continuity within Greece?\u201d The way you\u2019re asking this question presupposes doubt, and it kinda has a condescending tone. The way you\u2019re approaching the topic is problematic. If you pluck out specific dates from a country\u2019s history, yes culture and society will have considerable differences. But there was no single event that drastically changed Greek culture overnight. Modern Greece is descended from Medieval Greece, which is descended from Roman Greece, which is descended from Alexandrian/Hellenistic Greece, which is descended from Classical Greece, which is descended from Archaic Greece, Bronze-Age Greece, Mycenean Greece, and so on and so on. There is a gradual progression and continuity; the borders between all these periods are not clearly defined. I don\u2019t expect you to know most of what I just pointed out to you, but the two that should be no-brainers to you are: 1) language and 2) genetics to a high degree (do you think the ancients magically disappeared? Perhaps taken up by an alien space ship?). ",

            "answer_text": "During the first Persian War the Athenians told the Spartans the (four) main reasons forbidding them to side with the Persians. It is the first known declaration of what is considered a racial identity or, to be exact, the distinct identity of a specific tribal group within a wider tribal group. (Many ancient Greek authors regarded the Greeks as mostly being culturally distinct from their neighbors of central/southern Balkans and western Asia Minor). So, the identity comprised of: Same blood (origin). Biologically, modern Greeks are direct descendants of the Ancient Greeks with some admixtures of course (see the relevant genetic studies on Minoan and Mycenaean skeletons) - surprisingly low considering the geographical location of Greece. Neighboring population groups have, mostly, a significant or very significant percentage of Greek \u2018ancestry\u2019.Same language. Nowadays, modern Greeks speak the same Greek language, evolved through the passage of time. Unexpectedly, the Greek language has not changed dramatically during the passage of time; a modern Greek could be transported in time more than 2,000 years back and be 99% understood. At times, during the last centuries and under the Ottoman occupation, many Greeks were bilingual or not speaking the Greek language at all. (In several regions the Ottomans required that you had to either keep your language or your religion - or keep both and lose your head, literally). Especially after the Greek Independence War, the situation in the newly formed Greek state was rather dramatic - even worse than the several dialects spoken in Ancient Greece.Same religion. Although the religion itself is a different one than in the ancient times, religious uniformity is still considered an essential part of racial identity. The prevailing religion in Greece is Christian Orthodox nowadays and its course has been historically intertwined with the racial history, especially during the last millennium.Same customs. This may seem strange since the cultural diversity of Ancient Greece (and modern Greece - up to WW II) is a well-established fact. However, this refers to basic social concepts e.g. don\u2019t send old, \u2018useless\u2019 people to die alone in the desert or throw them to the dogs, don\u2019t marry your children etc. In ancient times, the lofty Greeks indoctrinated to their moral standards the local populations from Gibraltar to the northern Pakistan, usually by example and persuasion - sometimes at sword point. The partially hellenized Romans, being partially Greeks themselves, did the same.",

            "answer_text": "Are you asking about cultural or dna relation? At first I have to say that pure nations are existing only in dirty minds. Secondly, yes, in general there is a strong relation between Ancient and modern Greece. The modern Greek language is about 50% related to Classical Greek and 10% to non hindoeuropean language, probably pre-hellenic Greek. This is also a very accurate estimation about relation between ancient and modern Greece. There are some dna studies (nature magazine) talking about strong relation between ancient and modern Greeks. There are even figures of speech used the same today like 2000 years ago. Ancient Athenians for example used to move all the families to Salamis in case of danger. This happend also with the invasion of Xerxes and his Persians. On this island the Athenians were guarding, like a last frontier, their women, children, fathers, mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers, the most beloved ones, their entire life, their heart. Salamis was called also Koulouri, in Ancient and modern times. Greeks are using till today to say \u201cMy heart went to Koulouri\u201d to describe something horrifying. Some hypothesis of the past that all those invasions in Greece of Slavs, Albanians, Turks, and many others have changed significantly the dna of inhabitats of Greece. Falmerayer is the main historian who said this about 200 yeeas ago. This hypothesis is not accepted by majority of schoolars. A research by Science mag. is very interesting The Greeks really do have near-mythical origins, ancient DNA reveals Last week I went with my three children to the museum of ancient Corinth. My 11 years old daughter was able to read many ancient words encraved in marble 2000 years ago. Is there another ethnos worldwide where children of 10 can read a single word in their language but written 2000 ago? No German, French or English adult can read a word of German, English or French written even 1000 years ago, and correct me if I'm wrong. Modern Greeks are a mixture of ancient ones, like 50\u201360% (the above mentioned studies are talking about 75%), and other tribes that came here like Slavs, Albanians, and others. ",

            "answer_text": "It is perhaps easier to find out where today\u2019s Greeks are NOT related to ancient Greeks (how ancient can also be a factor here). Today\u2019s Greeks have a different RELIGION. They know their mythology well, they like the legendary heroes, they respect - even admire - the ancient Gods, but they are all Orthodox in their religious beliefs (few are regular church-goers but the Easter customs are unanimously observed). All other possible factors that make up an ethnicity are there: common language, common history, common culture, common geographic core. As for genetics, I am not an expert in the field. According to history, it is obvious that the Greeks have mixed with other peoples over the many centuries of their long history. The Middle East was long an area of lasting Greek influence. During Alexander\u2019s campaign and for one or two centuries afterwards the Greeks quite certainly mixed with Persians and other peoples, up to Afghanistan and India - but that did not bring Afghan or Persian \u201cgenes\u201d to Greece. Slavs repeatedly invaded Greece. They did not stay long but we must admit that some \u201cmixing\u201d, some integration, took place. This is also true for the migration of Albanians. When the Ottoman Turks invaded the Byzantine Empire and established their own empire in the Balkans and Asia Minor, it is quite clear that many Turks took Greek wives and had children which, however, were raised as Turkish Muslims. Today\u2019s Turkey has a high percentage of Greek genes (it\u2019s possible they are not aware about). The Greeks couldn\u2019t have Turkish wives, so one should not expect a high percentage of Turkish genes among the remaining Greek Christians, who succeeded to re-establish their independence after 1821.

            "answer_text": "Again, this has been asked ad neuseam. First the Music: Greek music as a whole has been unchanged for thousands of years, despite stylistic differences in different geographic areas. Thankfully Greeks developed a music notation system since very early, which allowed them to keep records of music compositions and songs that trace back to the Roman years (with the current Byzantine system) and earlier (with the Hellenistic and Greek systems). The songs allow modern Greeks to verify the continuity of their language, cultural motifs, the pronunciation and also the full extent of ancient musical scales, rhythms and mathematics imbedded in their culture. Religions: Their religion changed from worshipping the Great Mother Goddess of the Minoans to the Dodecatheon (after \u201cmother\u201d failed to protect them from the volcanic eruption in Santorini). They later adopted syncretic religions such as the Serapis/Isis etc Egyptian cults, and the Greco-Buddhist/Pyrrhonist hybrids during the Hellenistic years, and finally accepted Christianity during the Roman occupation. They failed to accept Islam. Writing: Their writing system was also changed from hieroglyphics to the Linears and later the alphabet. The language is the same however, and educated Greeks can fully read and understand archaic texts with minimum effort. Intermixing: Greeks traded with the world, and established ports and colonies around the Mediterranean since the dawn of civilization. They protected the eastern borders of the western world, fighting away a great number of Asian superpowers, until the end of the Byzantine empire. Slavs, Turks, Romans, Persians, Bulgarians etc all invaded. Genetically however, it appears that their influence was negligible. So, are modern Greeks related to Ancient Greeks: Modern Greeks directly descended from ancient Greeks, according to genetics. Their music is the same, their scales and rhythms unchanged, from the times of the Pythagoreans, down to Aristoxenos, to Bryennius and Plousiadenos to the reformation of the three teachers in the 1800\u2019s etc. The writing system went through changes, but the language remained the same. The religions changed, but ancient customs persisted among the people. The Greeks of today are the sum of all their experiences as a nation. Whatever they went through as a society fully reflects on them. They did not live in a time bubble and time did not stop for them or any other nation on the planet. ",

            "answer_text": "I mean seriously, this is all easily researchable: \u201cIn terms of the following criteria, Culturally\u2026\u201d [sigh] \u201cAncient Greece\u201d is a very broad and vague period in Greek history spanning 2000 years (not including the pre-Greek civilizations like the Minoans), from the arrival of Greek-speaking Indo-European tribes, to the fall of Rome (4th Century AD) which is generally considered the end of antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Most non-Greeks, when they think of \u201cAncient Greece\u201d, they\u2019re thinking of the Classical period, which was only about 200 years, or about 10% of that \u201cAncient Greece\u201d period. So, it\u2019s very stupid to think of \u201cAncient Greece\u201d as this long period of cultural paralysis. Greek culture changed as much -if not more- within the ancient period, as it has between then and now. All cultures evolve over time. That said, I would argue that certain basic things have remained the same. For example, Greek gender dynamics have a high degree of matriarchy, both then and now. The way Christianity is practiced in Greece today has borrowed a lot from the ancient, pre-Christian religion. In this very matriarchal culture, the Virgin Mary took the place of female dieties like Hera, and Christian patron saints for each town/region/island/profession have taken the place of patron gods/goddesses. So, the culture has evolved, but also remained the same to a high degree. \u201cLinguistically\u2026\u201d Well duh. Yes. Modern Greek is an obvious descendant of \u201cAncient Greek\u201d. And again, there is no uniform \u201cAncient Greek\u201d. The Greek language evolved during that very long \u201cAncient\u201d period. Someone from Classical Athens around 500 BC might have trouble communicating with the original Greek-speaking tribes that arrived in Greece over 1000 years prior if they met via time machine. That said, a modern Greek-speaker can understand Koine Greek (the phase of the language spoken during the Alexander and Roman period, and in which the New Testament was written) pretty well. Classic Attic (Athenian) Greek, which Plato wrote in, would be tougher to understand. But, the modern speaker would still be able to recognize a lot of the words. Basically, many of the word roots have stayed the same, but the inflections (word endings) have changed. This is no different than say Modern English versus Shakespearean English, Middle English, Old English, and Anglo-Saxon. \u201c\u2026Genetics/DNA\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a little tiring constantly being asked this, when other countries are not held to the same standard. The answer is: to a large degree. Greeks were never a 100% homogenous group. When Greek speakers arrived from the north, they absorbed the earlier peoples (like the Minoans and Cycladic peoples), as well as the Pelasgians (the indigenous Greek mainlanders about whom we know little about). During the Middle Ages, Greece absorbed significant Slavic immigration, but that\u2019s pretty much it. There were some Germanic (Viking and Visigothic) raids in the Middle Ages, but they didn\u2019t stay in Greece. The Turks didn\u2019t try to repopulate Greece either during Ottoman rule. If anything, some Greeks became Muslims and Turkish-speaking, and those people were viewed as \u201cTurkish\u201d after Greece\u2019s independence. Today, genetic tests place Greeks closest with Italians, Serbians/Croatians, Albanians, and to a lesser degree, Spaniards and Bulgarians. Turks are not that close, but they\u2019re not that distant either; this is because Turks have a very diverse background that includes some Greek ancestry \u201cCuisine\u2026\u201d Again, it gets tiring repeating this, but the \u201cAncient\u201d period was a long period, about 2000 years long. Someone from 100 AD and someone from 500 BC and someone from 1500 BC probably ate different things, let alone someone from Athens or Thebes or Sparta or Thessaloniki or the Greek colonies in Italy, etc. That said, some cuisine staples have remained constant for 4000 years: wheat, wine, olive oil, fish, and a couple other things. New ingredients were introduced into Greece over the centuries, like tomatoes which came from the Americas and oranges which came from South Asia. \u201cReligiously\u2026\u201d I answered this under \u201ccultural\u201d. \u201cIs there any real continuity within Greece?\u201d The method you\u2019re asking this question presupposes doubt, plus it kinda has a condescending tone. just how you\u2019re approaching the topic is difficult. In the event that you pluck down specific dates from a country\u2019s history, yes culture and society has substantial variations. But there was no single occasion that considerably changed Greek tradition instantaneously. Modern Greece is descended from Medieval Greece, that will be descended from Roman Greece, that is descended from Alexandrian\\/Hellenistic Greece, that will be descended from Classical Greece, that is descended from Archaic Greece, Bronze-Age Greece, Mycenean Greece, and so on etc. There clearly was a gradual development and continuity; the boundaries between these times are not plainly defined. I don\u2019t anticipate you to understand almost all of the thing I simply stated for your requirements, nevertheless the two that ought to be no-brainers for you are: 1) language and 2) genetics to a high level (do you believe the ancients magically disappeared? Perhaps taken on by an alien area ship?). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, to all of the above.  The other parts have been covered so I'll add some bits on the Genetics. The most straightforward evidence is the continued genetic relationship between Greeks and residents of areas previously colonized by Greeks.  Greeks and Italians are always grouped together (1) on any chart or phylogenetic tree containing the two populations. in the case of Southern Italy they are almost impossible to distinguish. The influence of the Greeks is still evident in the genetic map of Italy(2, 3). The areas of Apoulia, Calavria and Sicily settled by Greeks are easily distinguished. A 7%\u201322% contribution of Y chromosomes from Greece to southern Italy was estimated by admixture analysis of the current populations of the two areas (4). Sicily is especially important because a clear distinction exists between the West which shows Semitic influence (Phoenicians + Arabs?) and the East where studies estimate the genetic contribution of Greek at 37% (5).   The same continuity has been noted between areas of Southern France and Greece (6). To put it in a few words these areas on the Western Mediterranean coast have not shared the genetic history of the Greek population for the last 10 (in the case of S. Italy) and 20 centuries (in the case of France). The West has seen Germanic tribes invading, the East Slavs and Turks. Despite this there is a surprising degree of affinity in particular with Magna Graecia that the well known saying \"una razza, una faccia\" pictures. There can only be one logical explanation and that is common descent from Ancient Greeks.   Seldin M.F., Shigeta R., et al. (2006). PLoS Genet 2: e143. (Figure 4B) Piazza A., Cappello N., et al.

            "answer_text": "Yes lots. The language is basically the same. It has changed but all living Languages do. There was never a break where ancient Greek ended and modern Greek started unlike say French from Latin. Greeks are genetically related to their ancesters. Studies of skeletons show modern Greeks are of the same phynotype as ancients, a mix of alpine and Mediterranean peoples. Genetic studies have backed that up. Even minor DNA is still close to that of the modern people of Crete. Greece has had invasions but they never De-Hellenized Greece or replaced the people. Mostly they just added a bit. Greek DNA is still found in western Turks and Southern Italians who are decended from Greeks assimilated to those cultures. Some Greek food staples like bread, wine, olive oil (the Mediterranean trio) some cheese and folk dishes go back to antiquity. Others date from the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods when Greece was the center of trade. Even dishes with Turkish names (today) often predate Ottoman times. As for religion some Greeks have gone back to their native gods (as I have) paganism remained in parts of Greece after the year 800ce. Greek philosophy shaped Christianity. Practices, festivals, customs and beliefs survived in the church. Elements of Christianity show influence from Dionysus and Asklipios. Byzantine art drew on older styles. God's were recast as saints. Zeus was called the alpha and omega 1000 years before Christ. In Greek folk belief there are still gorgans and nymphs (often called nerida) fear of the unquiet dead and not letting the hearth fire go out existed into the 20th century.  Expressions like the god is raining, or the god is shaking his hair (for earthquakes) were common. Even greek urban legands, like the solider from the resistance killed in the civil war who comes back to seduce beautiful maidens or widows to impregnate them and raise any Army of sons to avenge his death draw on ancient themes. So yes, there is a relationship between modern Greece and ancient. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question that has been over-done to be honest. However, let me entertain it again. Societies at large always change and evolve, and in this globalised age this effect has become dramatically more obvious. Through that all, it is undeniable that Modern Greeks are related in many ways to the Ancient Greeks, but are not in any case \u2018the exact same people\u2019. Not even the Ancient Greeks themselves were the exact same people - in fact, NO nation has ever been made by the exact same people. It\u2019s just not possible. To explain how Greeks are related to Classical Greeks, we need to use a criterium. And so I say, who better than Herodotus? He uses this formula: \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd, \u1f10\u1f78\u03bd \u1f45\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f41\u03bc\u03cc\u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03b5\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f31\u03b4\u03c1\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f24\u03b8\u03b5\u03ac \u03c4\u03b5 \u1f41\u03bc\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u2026 The Hellenic nation, which is described by the same blood, same language, and common religious institutions, sacrifices and mannerisms\u2026 There are hence, broadly three criteria. Obviously, Herodotus used this specifically for the contemporary period, so below the criteria are used in a different, much wider sence - time:  Blood.Now, I have to say that to me blood is the least important of the three, but genetics do of course play their role in a nation. This being so, \u2018purity of blood\u2019 does not exist anywhere on the planet - we\u2019re not immovable items, many people move around in search of new experiences, and this has perhaps applied no more to one people than the Greeks. Nonetheless, genetic evidence certainly shows that Modern Greeks descend, but not without foreign input, from the Minoans and Mycenaeans. This is described in this scientific study - Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans [summarised here - The Greeks really do have near-mythical origins, ancient DNA reveals] Modern Greeks resemble the Mycenaeans, but with some additional dilution of the Early Neolithic ancestry. Our results support the idea of continuity but not isolation in the history of populations of the Aegean, before and after the time of its earliest civilizations. There\u2019s also another way to see this - namely compare with neighbouring nations:   [SOURCE: http://www.uwyo.edu/buerkle/evol_life3500/papers/novembre08.pdf Genes mirror geography within Europe] As you see in the graph above, Greeks generally sit right in between the (mainly Southern) Italians, (Southern) Albanians and (Western) Turks, while being distant from the Slavic nations. All three of these share similarities in haplo-groups, as all three are majorly descendants of ancient people inhabiting that part of the Mediterranean. As such, in the weak criterium of genetics, the Greeks do certainly show strong affinity with the Ancient Greeks.  2. Language. This is a much better criterium. Now, as above, all aspects relating to humans advance, and this includes language. I do not think I have to say much here, insofar as Modern Greek is clearly a language that descends from Ancient Greek. Indeed, this is the line of progression:  [SOURCE: Indo-European Languages] Greek has among the longest recorded continuous use, and has progressed mostly naturally ever since. It is not easy for a Modern Greek speaker to read Attic Greek (unlike Koine Greek and later), but the language is still much closer to it than, say, English is to Old English - despite the former two differing by some 2500 years, and the latter by 1000 years. Hence, the language clearly comes from Classical Greek, following a very long progression path.  3. Culture (including religion) This is inevitably the trickiest part, by far. Like language, it is extremely important. Obviously, we\u2019re talking about 2500 years here. In Europe, and in most of the world, we\u2019re barely alike to our ancestors some 100 years ago, so imagine that times 25! The biggest difference here is, of course, religion. The Ancient Greeks believed in the \u2018Dodecatheon\u2019 (called \u2018Hellenism\u2019 outside Greece), a religion all too similar to most people. Modern Greeks are overwhelmingly Orthodox Christians, a religion that has been at odds with the former. This being noted, we must remember that it was the Ancient Greeks, whether by choice or force, that converted to Christianity - it\u2019s not the case that (Modern) Greeks suddenly chose some 100, 500, 1000 etc years ago to switch religions. Ever since the Ancient Greeks converted, Christianity has been the dominant religion for the Greeks, and indeed said Greeks played an enormous role in its development, most notably the New Testament being written in Greek and (among others) addressed to Greek audiences, as well as the Great Schism of 1054 AD. What is clear all throughout, however, is that the Greek identity continued strong, even if the Greeks may have also used different umbrella terms throughout their history.

            "answer_text": "A2A thanks, but this is a very old question and there are already some great answers here. Instead of reiterating things I agree with, I\u2019ll state my disagreements. How do you measure relation? Dimitra Triantafyllidou measures it by (m)DNA. I don\u2019t like measuring people, much more ethnicities and cultures by DNA. I\u2019ve met people of Turkish heritage who are far more Greek than many Greeks are supposed to be. You see, for me Greece is the culture. It\u2019s the culture of philosophy (usually combined with wine), of freedom of thinking, of doubting authority, of being politically incorrect, of not abiding to any rules, of respecting your countrymen some but respecting foreigners more. Greeks are brought up with some of these values via tradition (as in papous, yiayia), via education (study of the Classics and of history). Other influences like Orthodox Christianity and\u2026 the potato, differentiate modern Greeks from ancient Greeks. But, in my opniion, the relation is not measured in DNA or linguistics, or anything tangible/measurable. Greekness is a state of mind above all. <edit> As Sam so eloquently puts it in a comment: The mythology and philosophy of the past is embedded in modern manifestations of how we interpret the world.

Their purpose of course is a political agenda too complex to analyse here, but it has no real historical, genetic or otherwise evidence. Those are the nations who often say that Greeks are descendants of Africans, that Greeks never existed before the war of independence and so on. Don't buy into it\u2026 PS: the word Hellin (\u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd) isn't just ancient, it is prehistoric. The word Greek was used by Romans to describe Greek inhabitants in south Italy (Magna Graecia) since 9th century BC and Aristotle was the first to document it in 3rd century BC. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not an easy question and there is not an easy answer. Through out their written history, Greeks had some things in common. 1)They traveled a lot thus establishing trade routes and made colonies in various areas all around the Mediterranean sea. 2) Their main core was modern Greece and Ionia. 3) Due to economic and cultural reasons they embodied different populations in a similar way that the Roman did later in their history. Before Alexander the Great, Greek and Greek-speaking populations were mainly in the Balkans, Asia minor, Black sea, South Italy, South France (Massilia) and smaller trade cities all around the Mediterranean. After Alexander\u2019s conquest and the 2 centuries of \u201cDiadochi\u201d, Greeks (influence, culture, mixed paganistic religion and language, Koine) spread all over Egypt, Judea, Syria and Asia as far as India (Greco-Buddhism) creating Hellenistic kingdoms. \"Hellenistic\" is distinguished from \"Hellenic\" in that the first encompasses the entire sphere of direct ancient Greek influence, while the latter refers to Greece itself. In these areas they mixed with local population creating Hellenized cultures that would be dominant through the Roman reign and later the Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire). Roman-Latin culture was not strong enough to eliminate the Greek language, like it did in Spain, France etc.This weakness on behalf of the Romans allowed the Greek speaking part of the empire to survive the fall of Rome and struggle it\u2019s way until 1453. The people of Romania(Byzantium) considered themselves Romans although Greek was the official language. The population under Costantinople\u2019s reign was a mixtue of Greeks, Slavs, Armenians, Latins and various Estern populations. The name Greek was used to describe the pagan, the non-christian and Western Europe used it as a term to insult or categorize the so-called Romans of the East. If it wasn\u2019t for the language, we could not speak about modern day Greeks, that is a fact. It was only after Romania (Byzantium) had lost huge amounts of territory, under the threat of the Ottomans and the West was considered more or less an enemy that the Greeks of Byzantium started calling themselves Greeks again. Let\u2019s not forget that the term \u201cnation\u201d was not what it is today. Religion, areas of influence and wealth were more likely to determine your identity than the place of your birth. Many Roman emperors were from Serbia, North Africa etc. It is safe to assume that Greeks donated DNA with their presence in all the places they have been influential same as the Romans. Some places maintained dominant Greeks until the Middle ages such as the Balkan peninsula, South Italy, Sicily (until the 10th century), Egypt, Judea, Syria (until the apperance of Islam) and Asia minor. It is unsafe to imagine the percentage of this spread due to war, slave trade and the moving of different groups.The main difference between Romans and Greeks in terms of survival is that the Greeks adjusted and continued. Plus they handled enemies better using not only war but bribe and diplomacy (ex. Sicilian Vesper). When under Rome they became Romans, when under Roman Eastern Empire they became Christians and spread Orthodox Christinity to the slavic nations (Bulgaria, Russia, Serbia etc). In Italy, barbaric invaders like the Goths and the Lombards eventually settled in the conquered territories, mixed with them and later created something new. In Greece the Slavic invaders only settled for a while and the Turks later mostly took Greek children and wives but rarely the opposite. The Romans took Greek elements thus left the Greeks with their culture that eventually turned them to the high power status of Byzantium. Same cannot be said for the Ottomans. Religion was far too important at the time to allow a mixture. Up until 1821 and the war of independence Greeks were part of an Islamic empire. To conclude we could say that the Greeks came to mix with every culture that was part of the Mediterranean sea while maintaining today Greece and Ionia as the core. Romans, Persians, Slavs, Armenians, Venetians, Franks, Albanians and Turks are part of today\u2019s Greek population but due to geography and culture we can always assume that today\u2019s Greeks have serious connections with their ancient forefathers.

            "answer_text": "Im my opinion, without trying to be too scientific and exclusive, it is inevitable that many modern Greeks may be able to trace their origins (their gene pool) back to the ancient people of Greece. But genetic study shows that European people share common ancestry with their naighboors and each other pretty much at the same rate. This means that some Hungarians may have as much common ancestry with the ancient Greeks as some Cretan Greek. Culturaly however no. Obviously. Apart from language, which remains a constant, culture continously changes. Many people and ethnicities have come and gone through Greece and many non Greeks have also settled permanently. As a cultural and economic hub, Ancient Greece was a melting pot for ethnicities and cultures. I'm pretty sure that even the classical Greeks were way more different than the early Greeks. 2600 years and three empires later, modern Greeks are a completely different thing. ",

            "answer_text": "I will not reply directly with research that show that greeks are 80 per cent Ancient Greeks or less which are true . But i will try to share with you my experience and help you to do by yourself a genetic test. I lived in netherlands for 2.5 years. And while i was there i learned to distinguish greeks by their speech face characteristics and the way they were dressed. Greek have a very distinctive face that you can hardly mistake by another ethnicity . Big eyes and Strong features hair color doesnt count as Blond or light brown can occur also by mutation and not by foreign dna. Now something about genetics. If you see people that strong look alike like the chinese or the Dutch this means that there was a lot of intermixing in their society thats why they look a lot alike. In the case of Greeks i would say that Greeks have simila features in a percent of 80 or 60 . If you visit areas outside greece this is more than obvious . As people in my village share a lot of similar feature . Stong eyebrows Now if i compare Greeks with other Nations i see that South Italians or turks at the cost of asia minor also share similar features. This is not by lack but because of history . This means that those people have a common ancestor and that common ancestor are the ancient Greeks for sure. you can do this test on your own Compare South Italians from Calabria with South Greeks I will give you an example the football player Karagunis with Genaro Gatuso . Or compare the Turks that speak Greek in the north of turkey with the greeks from the area of Salonique ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! I will try to be brief here so not to tire you. In fact genetically and historically it has been proven that for example Cypriots are the descendants of Lacedaemonians (Spartans). Also our Cypriot dialect alongside dialects from Greek islands like Rhodes and Crete is in fact very close linguistically to ancient Greek. Obviously many places in Greece still retained their names after all this years (e.g Macedonia, Athens, Sparta, Thrace to name a few). As far as cuisine goes the Greek cuisine has retained some elements of ancient Greece (of course no black soup). For example we still use olives, grain, salt, vinegar etc in our foods. We still have meat and milk products in our diets. Religiously obviously we no longer believe in the 12 Olympian gods, but an interesting fact is that we still remain to this day a unified nation in terms of religion. Just like the ancient Greeks had a common religion everywhere it is still the case today in modern Greece. Unfortunately I have to admit that right now we have many people in Greece that are unworthy of our ancestors\u2019 legacy. But this is another subject\u2026. ",

I am too lazy to look them up, but yes Greeks are descendants of the ancients, its been proven many times. Greek nationality is very indigenous, if you look at paintings of the ancients or look at statues depicting real people like Socrates and Plato they look similar to the Greeks today. Actually i am going to take my time and show you so you will see. This is Plato  Aeschylus  Boy from Kythera  Herakles, not real figure but looks very similar to some Greeks  Greek philosophers, first guy is Socrates  Cleisthenes, father of democracy  Pericles  Alexander the Great  Not that much different from Greeks today.

Some articles had given DNA results that suggest that over 96% of modern Greeks share the same DNA that ancient Greeks had. Culture has changed a lot. A new religion has been adopted by the Greeks 1800 years ago. That has changed about all customs but it has not unrooted them. Many celebrations had been kept in the Christian religion but changed their names. Christian saints are now celebrated instead of Olymbian gods. Modern or ancient, Greeks share the same love for freedom, the same language (more or less)and many trades of character. ",

While I am not sure whether that study is reliable (I read it years ago), it certainly provides an insight into how the demographics of a population changes over time, and presents an argument for a race to be pure-had the Hellenic people remained Hellenic, we could have learned much more about the Ancient greeks, how they were like, they history, and their mythology. (And perhaps Greece wouldn\u2019t be bankrupt now). So no, they were not really related to the Ancient Greeks, and if they were it would have been a lot better. ",

            "answer_text": "if modern greeks are related to ancient greeks, why it is argued that ancient egyptians dont relate with modern egyptians as they have \u2018\u2019sub saharan genes? if egyptians are not ethnically unified, why is it claimed that greeks are? i think that this genetic bubble can be easily burst once we take the argument to the europeans themselves. europeans just like to make things up using genetics, and the grapes are sour when their own assumptions and conclusions are reversed. the people who reside in the area formerly \u2018\u2019ancient greece\u2019\u2019 are the true descendants of the lad and people for me, even if they dont speak the greek language at all, even if turks, romans changed the entire genetic makeup of the modern people native to greece. regards ",

            "answer_text": "Did you know that Sultan Abdulhamit 2nd had banned Albanian language in Greece so as to protect the Greek culture from going extinct? Most people that consider themselves as Greeks today in reality have Albanian ancestors (they would deny it and hate it but true). Greeks started as 4 different ethnicities: Aeolians Achaeans (You know them from trojan war) Dorians (Fighters of sparta (Laconia) and Crete, Mr Panos also here\u2026 :) ) Ionians (All those art, science and philosophy) Considering Persian, Helenistic , Roman and Ottoman eras, and the fragility of the original Greek ethnical jeopolitics, (being \u201clocated in city states like frogs around a pond\u201d and traveling around in ships) I think Greek-ness was and is mainly a linguistic and cultural phenomenon rather than physical. Having said that, their culture also had some continuity problems, the smallest of which probably being the Roman or Ottoman rule. I would consider switching to christiandom to be the most dramatic identity-change. (after which people comfortably broke ancient sculptures and robbed old graves) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, modern Hellenics are ancient Hellenics, but not all Hellenics in ID are Hellenics in blood. I would say the 60-65% of the population is. Mostly because blood type O fulfils all the original genetically characteristics of Hellenics! Green/blue eyes, greek feet, etc. In ancient years they paid lots of attention at your feet. Modern DNA analysis also proves that and multiple genetic researchers claim the same thing! They also claim that we Hellenics have an extra dna string but not active so its considered as trash for medical terms, lots of studies out there. BUT YES we are surrounded by haters, everybody knows that and they claim the opposite. An example is this humanoid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Philipp_Fallmerayer historically proved, Turkish ottomans hired him to make a \u201cresearch\u201d for the originality of the Greeks and he said \u201cthey are not Greeks\u201d BUT he is not a scientist! He is a gipsy nomad (he was a gipsy at ways of life) who loved some comforts during the end of ottoman empire. But mistakenly haters use his \u201cresearch\u201d as science in nowadays! But hey! They also claim the earth is flat! ",

            "answer_text": "Do we really need an answer to this question? As far as I read in the over 60 answers, the comments by persons with Greek names are similar. They claim to to be related to Ancient Greeks because of the common language, religion etc. Why not accept this feeling as a proof? Is X % common DNA a better proof? When I remember the percentage of common DNA between humans and apes, it is better not to rely on this if you are not an expert who could judge the numbers. In my opinion, surviving foreign rule for more than a millenium - including an identity robbery - as a community contributes more to a nation than anything else. This opinion is also based on a survey among Egyptians when 97% of them felt as members of a nation. But you can see in their faces that they cannot have too many common genes. Shall we tell them that they are separate people? ",

So, most of the \u201cancient Greek\u201d DNA got lost when the Greeks mixed with the locals, and the slaves they owned during the Byzantium Empire. Genetically speaking Greeks are the closest to Italians, Jews, and the Balkans (Albania, Macedonia, Romania, and Bulgaria). But for example Greek Cypriots are genetically closer to people from the Levantine (Druze and Lebanese).  ",

The grammar (e.g., declensions of nouns) and use of accents have been simplified. And, although I believe it is unknown exactly how the earlier forms of the language (classic, Homeric, biblical) were pronounced, the other aspects of the language simplification imply that the pronunciation has also been simplified over time, for example some diphthongs written differently are now pronounced the same.
