            "answer_text": "IR affects our everyday lives by influencing us through the products we buy, the ideas we value, and the well-being of our family abroad and at home. For example, the value of the U.S. dollar is based upon economic policies the U.S. has with other nations. Therefore, if these policies are weak, so is the dollar which affects their standing in the global economy. U.S. relations with foreign states affects the price of products we buy. U.S. taxes on foreign products influences whether consumers spend their money on foreign or domestic products. International relations also affects the business industry because many companies are outsourcing jobs to other nations because their labor is cheaper. We affect international relations through the cars we drive. By choosing to drive less fuel efficient cars, we cause the U.S. to depend more on oil producing countries. Also, the U.S. citizens can influence which type of foreign policy the U.S. promotes by voting for a particular Presidential candidate. In addition, the United States tends to have better relations with nations that hold the same values as the U.S. public and worse relations with nations that have opposing values. ",

            "answer_text": "International Relations do affect your daily life in many ways: It influences whether you as a person need a passport and/or a visum when travelling abroad or whether you are even welcome in a certain country at all. Example of the latter: president Trump tried to refuse entry into the US for travellers from a certain group of \u2018Muslim\u2019 countries. This has nothing to do with you personally, but it affects your life. And sometimes international relations interferes positively in your daily life: the EU countries have agreed on free traffic of persons within their borders, so no more border controls once you are inside. And as an EU-citizen you may now reside and work in any other EU country. Similarly, the countries of the Arab League have agreed that their citizens do not need a visa anymore when travelling from one Arab country to another. International Relations also affect you daily life when it comes to goods and services: how expensive it is to buy imported goods and how heavily they are taxed. If you country is under an international boycot it may be very difficult to get certain goods you need, such as medication. When you use your mobile phones and call abroad, the fact that you can do this and at what rate is a result of international negotiations. International relations also interferes in the money matters: When you\u2019re living in a West African country you\u2019ll use nowadays the CFA as eight independent states in West Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo have agreed to use the same currency. Same story for EU-citizens now using the euro, doing away with their trusted national currencies and now using a single common currency. In conclusion: IMO it is safe to state that the role of international relations in our daily life, though perhaps hidden, is a big one. ",
