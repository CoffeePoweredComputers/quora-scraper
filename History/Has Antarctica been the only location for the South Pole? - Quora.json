            "answer_text": "If you mean the magnetic south pole, that does wander around, just like its sibling the north magnetic pole.  At the moment, the south dip pole is actually off the continent, a few miles off the coast in the Pacific Ocean. And then, the poles do swap places every few tens of millennia. A short or long while from now, the north magnetic pole will be somewhere around Antarctica and the south pole will be in the North Polar Sea or Canada or Siberia or somewhere a pole apart from where it is now. And the world\u2019s compasses will have to be repainted, and the maps reprinted. (Or maybe we\u2019ll redesignate the north and south poles of magnets instead. Or maybe there\u2019ll be a war between the geographers and the physicists over who has to change what.) As far as the spin poles go, there\u2019s the fact that the solid rock of the Earth is not that solid, on geological timescales. The liquid outer core is not solid at all, of course. But even the mantle, under the extreme pressures and heat of the centre of the Earth, while it isn\u2019t liquid, it is plastic (in the sense of being mouldable). And because the crust lies on the mantle, it moves around as well, dragging the continents with it.  As part of the supercontinents of Pangea and Gondwanaland, Antarctica has migrated from the tropics half-a-billion years ago to its present position in the south. It is predicted that it will drift back up north over the next several hundred million years as the continents collide to form a new supercontinent, named Novopangea by geologists, in a fit of originality.  Although, there are alternative predictions for the future conglomeration, including one that Antartica may stay where it is, the Amasia scenario.  Perhaps, in the long term, it\u2019s more accurate to ask if the South Pole has been the only location for Antarctica. ",

            "answer_text": "No, the continent we now call Antarctica was once part of the super-continent we call Gondwanaland during the Jurassic era, and at that time it was much farther north and had a tropical climate. Plate tectonics and continental drift saw it break away and move South to the position we see it in today. During the Gondwanaland period the South Pole was located in an area of ocean. ",
