            "answer_text": "Why did the Federalists support a strong national government? There were several reasons\u2026 but to be clear, what they meant by \u201cstrong\u201d and what is understood today, are two completely different things. One of the biggest reasons, was States were interfering with the commerce of other States: A very material object of this power was the relief of the States which import and export through other States, from the improper contributions levied on them by the latter. Were these at liberty to regulate the trade between State and State, it must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the articles of import and export, during the passage through their jurisdiction, with duties which would fall on the makers of the latter and the consumers of the former. We may be assured by past experience, that such a practice would be introduced by future contrivances; and both by that and a common knowledge of human affairs, that it would nourish unceasing animosities, and not improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquillity. Federalist No 42 So as you can, the original concept was to keep the States from interfering in each others commerce, NOT give the Federal carte blanche to regulate and control private enterprise and trade. One of the other issues was revenue. The confederation had no power to tax. The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State. Federalist No 45 Again, the power to tax, was not intended provide an unlimited budget, to by votes. Another issue was interstate jurisprudence, or the lack of an international court, so to speak, to hear cases from the Citizens of different States. the capital and leading object of the Constitution was to leave with the states all authorities which respected their own citizens only, and to transfer to the US. those which respected citizens of foreign or other states: to make us several as to ourselves, but one as to all others. Founders Online: From Thomas Jefferson to William Johnson, 12 June 1823 The US is an international alliance, or federation. There is no national government, only a federal government. So, they did not support a national government, because the US has no national government, as a national government is a Unitarian form of governance, and the US is a federation. The US is not one nation, as modern propaganda, and socialist pledges would have you believe, it is 51 nations. Doubt me? why do you think they have to go through the extradition process if a criminal is arrested in another State? So as an international alliance under the Articles of Confederation, the \u201ccentral\u201d or confederate government was kind like the UN\u2026 pretty much incapable of keeping States in line, if they didn\u2019t want to play nice with the other kids. What the new constitution, did, under federalism, is give the \u201ccentral\u201d or Federal Government, a little bigger stick, to smack the unruly kids with. But it was never supposed to be the omnipotent source of power, everyone today thinks it is. I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not granted; and, on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power. Federalist No 84 are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous stop a minute, and let that sink in\u2026 this is the arrogant, aristocratic, elitist, \u201conly the best should rule\u201d \u201cbig government\u201d Hamilton talking here. So if he is arguing against the Bill of Rights, fearing it will be used as an excuse to expand the powers of the Federal\u2026 just how damn limited do you imagine he thought they were? So a strong government, sure, but LIMITED to only those powers. ",

            "answer_text": "Their conceptualization of a \u201cstrong\" central government was a long way from today's definition. Better to say that they recognized the need for the federal government to be stronger than the Articles of Confederation that they had available. There were some strong disagreements on just how much stronger the government needed to be. And the erosion of the limits they tried to set have been appalling over the last 90 years. Ayn Rand's vision of creeping socialism has been almost a dystopian nightmare. ",
