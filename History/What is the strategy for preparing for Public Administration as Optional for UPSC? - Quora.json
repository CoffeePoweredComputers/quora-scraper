            "answer_text": "A2A Since my optional is also PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. So, i will mention here the references i go through for preparation. Strategy \u2013 1) Paper 1 and Paper 2 should be seen in an integrated form . 2) Go through previous year papers and write as many answers as possible. 3)Draw diagrams 4) Try to make notes of about 50 pages in short points. Your whole syllabus shall be covered in this . It will help you in revising whole subject in one day . 5) Write examples from current affairs . This reflects your understanding of subject. 6) There is nothing like \u2018hidden syllabus\u2019 so I request please don\u2019t waste time in that . PAPER \u2013 I Administrative Theory 1. Introduction: Mohanty sir\u2019s notes and Mohit Bhattacharya This chapter is very important mainly because the concepts of this chapter can be used in other parts. This should be prepared with chapter 2. 2. Administrative Thought: Prasad & Prasad and Mohanty sir notes . Use the concepts across the syllabus . Eg.- District administration needs to move towards system 4(Likert) 3. Administrative Behaviour:Mohit Bhattacharya and notes 4. Organisations: Mohanty notes , Rajni Goyal and Arora Regulatory bodies \u2013 a question is asked almost every year . 2nd ARC has 10-12 pages on this . Please go through that.5.

Comparative Public Administration:Notes , Mohit Bhattacharya and Prasad 8. Development Dynamics:Notes and Mohit Bhattacharya 9. Personnel Administration: Notes and Mohit Bhattacharya 10. Public Policy: IGNOU notes , Mohit Bhattacharya and use as many examples from current as possible. Eg.- Criticism of rational model \u2013 Bihar prohibition law that was misused at ground level .11. Techniques of Administrative Improvement: Read from internet12. Financial Administration: This chapter should be read with Financial Management 2nd ARC , Fadia PAPER \u2013 II In this paper one thing to remember is that your answer should not look like GS answer . So the solution to this is to use concepts of paper 1 in this paper so that it seems that the answer is written by student of Public Administration. 2nd ARC ,Mohanty notes and Rajini Goyal are sufficient for this paper . 1. Evolution of Indian Administration: Notes and Rajini Goyal 2. Philosophical and Constitutional framework of Government:Notes and Rajini Goyal 3. Public Sector Undertakings:Various reports and NITI aayog measures . 4. Union Government and Administration:Notes and Rajini Goyal 5. Plans and Priorities:Chapter is now almost obsolete.

            "answer_text": "Public Administration since its inclusion as an optional subject in Civil Services Examination has been a popular subject. Public Administration is a multidisciplinary subject. We find inputs of Psychology, Economics, Sociology, Political Science, Law, Anthropology & Management. The beauty of Public Administration is the availability of limited core concepts. A student has not to be perplexed with plethora of facts. Interlinkages of topics is another speciality of Public Administration. In other words, once a student has mastered a concept, he/she can apply that concept in other parts of the syllabus. For Public Administration, a student has just to refer 3-4 standard books which cover the whole syllabus. From the Institute student will get qualitative study material. After the change in pattern of examination in 2013, Public Administration is the optional subject that covers maximally the syllabus of General Studies. A student will have direct help from Public Administration in about 15 questions in preliminary examination. In the Main examination, the second paper of General Studies excluding International Relations is part of Public Administration. In the third paper of General Studies, topics like Internal Security are directly related to Public Administration. In the fourth paper of General Studies, nearly fifty percent of the topics are related with Public Administration. In the paper of essay which checks candidate\u2019s ability of flow of ideas, coherence of ideas etc. the nature of Public Administration will be a helping tool the candidate in essay paper. Also topics of essay will also be related to Public Administration. It has been a noticeable trend for Public Administration in UPSC examination, that a candidate is getting either good marks, or poor marks. A candidate gets good marks because of good understanding of the subject & ample awareness about recent developments. Lack of understanding, emphasis on rote learning, unaware about recent developments cause poor marks. This optional subject is advisable to those candidates who rely on understanding & having good expression power. A candidate before opting any optional subject must be aware about his/her aptitude.
