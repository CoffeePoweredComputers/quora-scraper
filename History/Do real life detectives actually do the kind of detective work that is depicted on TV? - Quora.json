Finding and interviewing witnesses and suspects, talking to \u201csnitches\u201d, waiting for lab work to come back, and constantly documenting the investigation. Often it takes weeks or months to \u201cdevelop a suspect\u201d and then you want all your evidentiary ducks in a row before ever bringing the suspect in to be formally interrogated. In \u201cdramady\u201d cop shows like Bones or Castle\u2026 The investigators always talk the suspect into a full confession without any of the required protections\u2026. Absurd. ",

            "answer_text": "In the UK, no, not really. The DCs I work with largely deal with a portfolio of jobs, usually several assaults, sexual assaults and rapes. Forensic work is sent off and comes back a couple of weeks later; the detectives don't go to the lab often. They largely interview suspects and witnesses and sometimes conduct house searches. In my town we have 2 or 3 murders a year and most of our detectives get involved in these. They rarely run after anyone. They do tend to work long hours when on a job and marriages tend to suffer. There are not many donuts but cakes are fairly plentiful. ",

All the subs show up on time and don't get in the way of each other. It's the only project any of them are working on. They leave out all the bent nails, wrong materials, bad cuts, bad measurements, permit issues, trash, etc. Somehow they compress a 6 month project into 30 minutes. Kind of like that but more screwed up. ",

If crimes are not solved within 48 hours, or they usually are never solved. A great book about real detectives is Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets by David Simon. ",
