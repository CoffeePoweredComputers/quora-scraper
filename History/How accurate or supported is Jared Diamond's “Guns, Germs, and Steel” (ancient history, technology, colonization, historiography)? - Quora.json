            "answer_text": "Diamond is an excellent writer and has a remarkable breadth of knowledge. So some of what he says, about some environment issues for example, are readily supported. My problem with his writings is that, as happens with persons with this much knowledge, analysis, curiosity, I believe he pushes and goes over the line in the conclusions he draws based on what he actually knows. Some persons with this high level of intellect stop themselves from believing there is no line separating them from their conclusions; some equally brilliant persons recognize that line and are satisfied with describing, analyzing what their studies actually teach them or what they learn as the result of pursuing those studies beyond their suppositions.

            "answer_text": "One of my favorite books. Jared Diamond is a professor of physiology at UCLA and a recipient of the MacArthur Foundation fellowship. His book includes pages of \u201cfurther reading\u201d and the book won a Pulitzer Prize. While you may find (as with any subject) some minor disagreements from various specialists, I think you can depend on the book to be as accurate as possible for the time it was written. ",
