Here are some 80s things I miss or no longer exist.  ** Bench seats. Bet you could get four people across there.  ** While I\u2019m thinking about cars I miss those days where we had our own little \u201croom\u201d in the back of the station wagon.  ** I almost forgot about these public service messages. We had no cell phones back then, and as kids out playing we were basically unreachable. The TV stations had to remind parents to make sure their kids were still OK.  ** I didn\u2019t know that bike helmets existed. Seriously.  ** We would just toss our bikes wherever and go away for hours. They would still be there when we got back.  ** During family gatherings, some families would give young ones (sometimes really young ones) sips of beer for \u201cfun\u201d. Does anyone else remember this or did I grow up around demented people? Today this would be considered child endangerment.  ** Remember waterbeds? Why did we think this was a good idea? If water weighs about 7 lbs per gallon (1 kg/L) I wonder what this bed weighed.  ** Does anyone else remember these plastic coffee stirrers from the 1980s? They were pulled out of restaurants rather abruptly.  ** Did you ever use one of these? They made you a bit sweaty in the summer.  ** Here is a Clapper commercial from 1984. Good luck getting that jingle out of your head.  ** My personal favorite, cool ranch Doritos were introduced in 1986. I still have no idea why the ranch flavor has to be cool. ",

            "answer_text": "What do you really miss from the \u201880s that no longer exists? Please read past the one-line answer because the devil is in the details: I miss the 18 year old drinking age. But it has nothing to do with the drinking. We were all drinking long before that - it was the 1970s after all. What an 18yo drinking age meant was clubs that you could get into either legally or with fake ID when you were in High School that had amazing bands. In the early 80s (and before that) I lived on Long Island (in New York) . We had a thriving band scene. You could go out and see bands that had not yet made it or even that had already made it, most nights of the week. Our locals were Blue Oyster Cult, Zebra, Twisted Sister, Rat Race Choir, The Good Rats, Pat Benatar, Harry Chapin, Billy Joel (and so many more). Go a mere 20\u201330 miles west toward NYC and you had Blondie, the New York Dolls, The Talking Heads\u2026 You get the idea. In late 1982 the drinking age became 18, then a couple of years later 21. Almost none of the clubs survived it. It is only in the last few years, as all of us are older, have spending money and most of our kids have moved out, that we again have lots of free time and suddenly clubs like that are starting to open again. Many of the old bands who never made it huge are back. There are also tons of tribute bands and bands that play the hits of the 60s, 70s and/or 80s. The shame of it all is that my kids, who also grew up here but have now both moved away, never had anything like that. Concerts meant Nassau Coliseum, Madison Square Garden along with the ridiculous ticket prices those places command. ",
