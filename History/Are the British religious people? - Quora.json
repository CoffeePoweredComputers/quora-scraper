            "answer_text": "You will be unable to find two surveys that provide similar statistics. Christianity is confirmed as the main religion with statistics ranging anywhere from 50-63%. Within these figures The Church of England is largest Christian faith, followed by Protestant, Catholic and smaller Christian societies. 2011 show 59.5% Christianity. Muslims make up 5% of religion. Hinduism represents approximately 1.3% Sikhism follows at 0.7%, Judaism and Buddhism both at 0.4% The 2011 census figures show 25.7% have no religion and 7.2% instated. The census indicated a 12% reduction in Christianity from 2001 census and it is expected the downward % is still continuing so current estimates are around 50%. The wide range of figures concerning Christianity are still unreliable and totally misrepresent the actual figure. A poll carried out by the Guardian in 2006 provided question \u2018which religion do you yourself belong to \u2018 with 64% stating Christianity and 26% stating \u2018none' Another question from the same survey asked \u2018are you religious\u2019 with 63% saying \u2018no' and 33% answering \u2018yes'. This is supported by decade by decade fall in Church attendances ever since the Victorian age. This is put down to advancements within scientific research giving better factually based understandings of the universe thus diminishing the scope of the supernatural and the role for a God. As a consequence there is a very large grey area whereby a high percentage choose Christianity as their upbringing religion although they are not actively involved or may not have any beliefs. I would place myself within this category. I was brought up Christian and went to C of E schools. I think at the age of 10/11 years old we were taught about the Old Testament during lessons and I also began to read it at home. I did not get very far through Genesis. It started OK but as soon as it introduced more and more people all over the age of 900 it seemed too far fetched for me and 10 years old. Additionally I was very interested in Astronomy and read many books on the subject at school. With significant technological advancements during the 80s I resumed with astronomical reading material but now books for adults moving on to complex topics of quantum mechanics, superstring theory, particle physics etc. My beliefs are now scientifically based. Having said that I believe 100% there was a person named Jesus and very likely the named disciples surrounding him. I think in the Biblical era stories were like Chinese whispers and became more exaggerated from village to village and finally into the miracles that the Bible depicts. I do not know if I qualify to be a Christian or even religious because I do not believe all of the teachings? Am I classified 33% C of E or completely written off as a non believer? ",

Back in the 70s when religious fighting between Catholics and Protestants kept religion in the news, churches were often standing room only. But since the end of the \u201ctroubles,\u201d religion has nose dived to today where churches are lucky to fill the front pew. Which just goes to prove the success of any religion relies on violence and hate. ",
