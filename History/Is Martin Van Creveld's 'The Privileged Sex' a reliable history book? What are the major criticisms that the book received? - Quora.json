That said, a general observation: Any self-published book written by a scholar on a complex subject completely outside their specialty should be approached with extreme caution. Making such a volume the first book you read on the subject in question is a Bad Idea on the level of asking your urologist to perform your upcoming heart-valve replacement. Making such a volume the only book you read on the subject in question is a Bad Idea on the level of asking your barber to perform your upcoming heart-valve replacement. ",
