            "answer_text": "It was hard. I remember our first test. Everyone in my class was used to getting easy A\u2019s, so it was a real slap in the face when we got our scores back. We didn\u2019t fail, but most of us got 4\u2019s or lower on our essays, and that was out of 10. My teacher said it was fine and that the first test of the year was always a \u201cbloodbath,\u201d to use her terminology. We just had to get used to doing more work. And I did. I think my average essay score for subsequent tests was a 7 or an 8 during that class. This was probably the hardest class I\u2019ve ever taken, in high school and college. Why? There was a lot of information to memorize, and I mean a lot. My teacher couldn\u2019t stress enough the importance of details. The more you wrote, the better off you were. So, that meant memorizing dates, battles, bills. Everything. By the end of the year, I had filled one notebook with information from lectures and the book and used up half of another one. Just to give you an idea, I typically use less than half of a notebook for each class, so this was a lot for me. I was the type of student who typically got away with studying the night before because I\u2019m good at memorization and that was usually all the time I required to get my A. In this class, I began drilling a week before. There was so much information to learn that I needed to space it out. I got a B in that class and never have I been prouder of a grade. I felt as though I worked myself to the bone and this was the fruit of my labor. Plus, I loved the class and the teacher I took it with ended up being my favorite teacher at the school. I\u2019m a history nerd, so I loved delving deeper into events from the 1800s to the present in the US. If you want to know about the official test, that was a completely different monster. I spent the month before going through my notebooks in my free time, focusing on a few chapters per day, so I didn\u2019t feel as though I was driving myself crazy. I ultimately got a 4 on my test. Not bad! I was expecting a 2. ",
