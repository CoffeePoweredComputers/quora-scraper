            "answer_text": "As Gustav Gr\u00f8nborg said, they made what was called a jury rig. How the jury rig was made would depend on where the mast broke, what spare wood they had available, how bad the break was, how far they had to go to find a boatyard and even what kind of ship it was and how it was rigged. Most merchant ships would often just sail without the mast and re-rig everything else so that the ship was still workable if much slower than before. They would head for the nearest safe port that could build them a new mast, taking care not to overstress what remained. Warships were a bit different because they had lots more crew and they usually had to remain on station or get to a destination no matter what, so frequently they\u2019d just partner the mast to the stump that remained sticking up out of the deck. Partnering means that they take both pieces of the broken mast and overlap them, then they put either metal hoops around to band them together (like barrel hoops only bigger) or they do what\u2019s called wolding - wrapping tarred rope around and around as tight as they possibly could so that the broken pieces hold together (sort of). This would of course mean that the remains of the mast would be much shorter than the original. Warships carried a lot of extra spars and plain squared wood that the ship\u2019s carpenter (a luxury that merchant ships didn\u2019t have) would use to carve out a new mast. Usually they had big enough pieces of wood that they carried on beams across the spar deck (top deck) where they also carried the ship\u2019s boats. Warships had to be prepared for a lot of broken spars and masts because in a battle the cannons would often fire chain shot (two cannonballs joined together by a length of chain) or bar shot (two half cannonballs joined together by two lengths of interconnected metal bars) that would spread apart and break masts and yards and cut away rigging so that the masts would break from their own then unsupported weight. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for a warship to be completely dismasted in which case everything would have to be made to be able to get enough sail up to be able to limp back to port. As long as they could get within a few miles of port the warships had enough crew (and small boats) that they could put all the men into the boats with ropes and tow the ship the rest of the way. It must have been backbreaking work towing a 220 foot long three-decker by muscle-power alone. ",

            "answer_text": "It is worth noting in respect to this that a three masted sailing ship was in fact a nine masted sailing ship. The main topmast was stepped on top of the main mast, and the top gallant mast was stepped on top of the top mast, so that the main mast really consisted of three seperate masts. The fore and mizzen masts were similar. Usually it was one of the upper sections that came down, unless military action was involved. The lowest section was stepped on the keel, massively supported by multiple transverse cables (shrouds) and longitudinally supportive stays (forestay, mainstay, and mizzen stay.) In the later days of sailing ships, it was commonly riveted steel or iron. It was massively strong, extraordinarily unlikely to fail, and served as the foundation for the two top sections, commonly timber, stepped on it. The transverse boom carrying the \u201cmain sail,\u201d the lowest one, was suspended on a forged \u201ccrane,\u201d and aligned by two tackles called \u201cjeers.\u201d The other booms, and their attached sails, were named by the mast section to which they were attached. From the clipper ship era, a quick way to tell the difference between a British built ship from an American built, is that the British almost invariably split the topsail into an upper and lower topsail, while the American ships, equally almost invariably, had a single very large topsail.  The British built \u201cCutty Sark,\u201d showing the three mast sections, and upper and lower topsails.  The \u201cFlying Cloud,\u201d American built, note single topsail. Sorry, I am wandering, and on my hobby horse, obviously. The upper mast sections were also supported by shrouds and stays, but as the \u201cCutty Sark\u201d picture shows, fewer of them. In fact, the higher you went, the weaker things became. It was the upper masts, or sections of mast, that were most likely to be damaged. With the main part probably intact, it served as an excellent crane, along with whatever else was left, to hoist the new jury rigged spar. Spare spar lengths were carried, and non essential spars, such as stunsail booms would also be used. Others have described the \u201csistering\u201d and other repair processes. All of which came under the responsibility of the \u201cShips Carpenter,\u201d a remarkably skilled individual, who was commonly the foreman shipwright when the ship was built, and who went to sea with her. \u201cCutty Sark\u2019s\u201d carpenter, James Henderson, actually built from scratch, using spare timber, stanchion posts, and a makeshift forge, a whole new rudder, at sea, and further installed it, in the middle of the ocean, and not in good weather at the time.  There are notes in the log about how the work was interrupted at times by \u201cSharks and other voracious fishes,\u201d as the helpless, rudderless, ship rolled heavily in post cyclonic swells. The men who sailed these ships, for strength, skill, courage and endurance were on a whole other plane to the seafarers of today, skilled though they are as well. Edit: I cannot help myself, in closing, I just have to add Jack Spurling\u2019s wonderful painting of \u201cFlying Cloud.\u201d Again, single topsail. As well as stunsails, the ancestor of todays spinnakers, \u201cA\u2019low and a\u2019loft,\u201d and a \u201cbone in her teeth.\u201d  Edit 2: Since this seems to have attracted a bit of interest, the best illustration I can find to attest to the strength of sailing ship main (lower) masts is this picture of the \u201cLady Elizabeth,\u201d built in 1879 and wrecked in the Falkland Islands in 1912. She has been there ever since, and the masts and the main yard are still there. The Mizzen does not even have any standing rigging left, and it is still upright. And the weather, well, it looks bloody awful.  ",

            "answer_text": " Full rigged ships rarely lost a whole mast. The rigging system was both more complex and more fail-safe than the question implies. Here is a drawing of a 16th C galleon. See how the masts rise only to the height of the tops (platforms for the crew). You can tell because its not a continuous column. The spar above the top is known as the topmast. It is thinner and lighter than the mast. Above that is another top or sometimes just the crosstrees, and then another spar, even lighter than the topmast, which is called the topgallant. If a spar failed, it was unlikely to be the stout and comparatively short mast. The upper spars and rigging often did fail. Failures occured when a ship was trying to go too fast in bad weather, or maybe trying to escape capture by a warship. But ships usually carried spare spars, which could be rigged as topmasts or topgallants. Sailors were good at carpentry and improvising in general. It would have been a difficult job, but possible, to replace a broken topmast while at sea, if the weather was fair. Another advantage of this system is that the crew could take down, or strike, the upper spars if bad weather was expected. A ship would be safer in a storm with her topgallants on deck. The horizontal spars are called yards, BTW, and they also failed sometimes. If a ship did lose a mast, which would also take down the spars and rigging above, it could be disastrous. Such an event could happen in a naval battle or very severe storm. ",

            "answer_text": "Ships in the age of sail carried extra spars in order to replace those broken in storms and battle. They would be lashed down in the holds, or lashed to the decks. It is difficult to haul the spars out of the holds, especially while sailing, but the thing to do is to bunt up the existing sails and try to sit in one place so that all hands could be available. To replace a mast, the neighboring mast would be rigged up to use as a crane so that the new mast could be hauled upright. While some of the crew hauled away to raise the mast, other crew members would guide the mast to the piercing on the deck. Then they would lower the mast into place down below. The yards, (these are the cross pieces to which the sails are attached) are then sent up and rigged with earrings, sheets, halyards, ratlines (the ladder-like lines that the sailors use to climb aloft), and braces. If this sounds involved, it is, but these sailors know what they are doing and can get all this done quickly and be on their way. ",

Ships would sometimes sail home on a \u201cjury rig\u201d made out of whatever they had that could be made to stand up and carry sail. If the ship was disabled where there was suitable timber on shore, new masts could be cut and shaped Raising a mast is not too difficult if the weather is calm. A gin pole can be fastened to the spar, and a line run over the pole to the capstan. Another way to raise a mast is sheer legs, which straddle the mast. The mast is first lifted, (the higher it can be lifted, the easier it is to pull it up the rest of the way.) then the sheer legs are pulled forward (or aft, if the mast is being raised that way) as the top of the mast is also pulled forward.

This is \u201cgreen\u201d wood. I suppose that in a pinch it would suffice, but I don\u2019t know enough about wood curing to judge. The curing or drying of wood, is to remove water from it. Though one might think that a freash cut tree used for a mast, would allow it to flex more in the process of sailing. ",

In the case of a large or mainmast, it was only possible to fashion a shorter replacement from the broken one and whatever else was available or was worth cannibalising. It was not practical to carry a spare full-length main mast. ",
