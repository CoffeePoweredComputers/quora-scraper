            "answer_text": "Some thinkers, like Ayn Rand, have the reputation of being a philosopher, but really aren\u2019t. Philosophy is not immune to political currents and pressures. There was a time when the greatest philosophers were all theologians. Who remembers the brilliant German philosopher Meister Eckhardt today? He was a Christian pantheist at a time when this was outright heresy (he escaped the Inquisition by dying first). Stalin was a deeper thinker than Hitler, but the only reason we remember Stalinism is because he killed so many people. Philosophers can go unnoticed without being insignificant or mediocre. Francis Bacon made a huge splash in 1600, but only students of philosophy remember him today. Rousseau, despite his enormous importance, is unknown to the man/woman on the street. ",
