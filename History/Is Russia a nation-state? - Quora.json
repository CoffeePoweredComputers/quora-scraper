            "answer_text": "No, the Russian Federation is not a nation-state, if you define that as a state formed around a single ethnic group. It is a multinational state. Although it might seem obvious that Russia is the country of the Russian people, that is not exactly the case. Russia is nominally a federated state of eighty-five federal subjects. Twenty-two of these are national republics, five autonomous okrugs, and one an autonomous oblast, that represent about thirty-six distinct titular nations, ethnic peoples native to Russia. And there are over a hundred other groups, with native languages from at least seven unrelated language families. Languages from the Indo-European, Mongolic, Northeast Caucasian and unrelated Northwest Caucasian, Turkic, and Uralic families have official status in parts of the RF. Ethnic Russians have settled throughout much of the Russian Federation, and don\u2019t have a designated federal subject. Their native language is the state language, and, as of Putin\u2019s 2020 constitutional amendment, they are defined the \u201cstate-forming nation\u201d (so maybe someone envisions a long-term project to create some kind of more integrated nation-statehood). Russian nationality is a complex subject, and lacks a single definition. The Russian language, uniquely, has different words for Russian nationals (rossiyane) of Russia (Rossiya), and ethnic Russians (russkiye), as well as the ethnic nationalist concept of an extended \u201cRussian World\u201d (russkiy mir). Russian official and unofficial policy and rhetoric have always considered the question of nationality, as it had in the historical Russian empire (1721\u20131917) and Soviet Union (1922\u201391), and not only as ethnic ancestry, but European or Eurasian identity, observation of Eastern Orthodox Christianity (although over nine million Russians are muslims), and language as well (for example, an official justification for the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of its Crimean peninsula was \u201cprotecting Russian-speakers\u201d). Having an independent state since only 1992, Russians, in the broader sense, are still seeking to define themselves as a modern nation, as is much of the world.

The pale areas in the northwest have fewer than 1 person/square kilometre.  ",

            "answer_text": "No, neither are most of the world\u2019s states, because most of them have more than one nationality or language inside it. Nation-state as per its usual definition is what the states what use this term would like to be but they aren\u2019t, hence the reason by which most of them have had in the past or have now policies which aimed (or aim) at cultural, linguistical, and every possible form of non physical genocide with the goal of assimilation. Those who resist to that are uncomfortable. A pure nation state is a country with only one native language and culture. And by native I mean language which has always been the one spoken there and has not being substituted by others. Only Iceland qualifies for this. ",
