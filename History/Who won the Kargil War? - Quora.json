            "answer_text": "Kargil war was a total disaster for India as well as for Pakistan on two totally different levels, for two totally different reasons. It did not create any permanent or even temporary change on the map. The \u201cwinner\u201d is then determined by who did more damage and this is a highly controversial thing to investigate because of reasons I will try to explain below. India\u2019s official version on this war is published in Kargil Commission Report. The very fact that an official inquiry called \u201cKargil Review Commission\u201d was launched on July 29, 1999 means that Indian defense circles treated this as their defense failure which needed to be addressed via an national level investigation . You do not launch inquiries into an operation that went well so this alone shows that it was not a success. This inquiry was headed by KK Hazari (former Vice Chief of the Army Staff.) BG Verghese (member National Security Council Advisory Board) Brajesh Mishra (National Security Advisor) and a few other very high level defense officials. In order to address the failures of Kargil war two further task forces were created and these were Naresh Chandra task force and Ravindra Gupta task force. In spite of all the investigations and the changes that followed within India\u2019s own defense set-up, Indian government\u2019s public perception is that it was a war that India won! This notion was challenged by the man who led the Kargil War from the Indian side, Lt. Gen Kishan Pal in the following interview.  The views that General Pal expressed above are not much different than what Kargil Commission Report had already addressed but since India\u2019s public perception of the war and its defense perception of the war had been kept separated, Kishan Pal became a controversial figure while all the members of Kargil Commission Report who have stated the same view never took any flak. In Pakistan, no inquiry was ever launched by the military. The Pakistani \u201cirregular\u201d army Northern Light Infantry (NLI) that crossed the border and fought the war was promoted and integrated into the ranks of Pakistan\u2019s regular army. The Pakistani irregulars who crossed into Indian side of Kashmir and fought the fourth largest army in the world had no air-force support. Most of the time they were not even supported by Pakistani artillery. Armed with nothing but small arms and shoulder mounted rockets they engaged the Indian army for more than two months on their own soil. They were a tactical group that caused a strategic mobilization requiring airforce and massive number of troops that are normally needed to attack a foreign country not to drive out militants from your own! Furthermore they shot down two Indian jets brought down a helicopter and inflicted more losses on the Indians than Israel took in its two years occupation of Lebanon. Further reports indicated that General Pervez Musharraf had crossed the border into Kargil without being detected by the Indian airforce and spent the night there. Most records you generally find in the Pakistani side are of promotions and celebrations and an inquiry similar to India\u2019s Kargil Commission report does not exist. On Political front, the war was a total and all out disaster for Pakistan. In spite of the massive and overwhelming success that Pakistani forces had experienced during the initial phases, it was by and large, an unauthorized war which was the brain child of Pervez Musharraf. He had no authorization from Pakistan\u2019s democratically elected PM Nawaz Sharif to conduct this operation and Pakistan\u2019s political leadership came under tremendous international pressure. The domestic pressure in Nawaz Sharif was to deploy the Pakistani air force and start an all out war with India, which was badly pinned down in Kargil. International pressure on Pakistan was to withdraw because an all out war with India would mean two nuclear armed countries going to war. International community came down very hard on Pakistan and Bill Clinton told Nawaz Sharif to announce in official withdrawal. Nawaz Sharif ignored the domestic pressure and succumbed to international pressure and announced a withdrawal. His political career was finished and a military coup led to him being exiled. If Nawaz Sharif and his political party admit that they had withdrawn from a battle that Pakistan was winning then this would be political suicide. In order to save his own political career, him and his government officials have always projected Kargil conflict as Pakistan\u2019s military defeat which they were able to \u201csave\u201d by negotiating a timely withdrawal. This version is motivated more by Pakistan\u2019s internal politics than realities on the ground in Kargil. So who won Kargil war? According to India\u2019s defense establishment, Pakistan. According to Pakistan\u2019s military circles, Pakistan. According to India\u2019s government, India. According to Pakistan\u2019s government of that time, India. Readers are free to form their own conclusion. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many winners, some winning all the way to the present day. First you have the many variants of the Pakistani Taliban and their assorted Lashkars. India and Pakistan cut of all contact with each other and their respective leaders went on a multiyear often religious based jingoistic tirade against each other - and in this poisonous atmosphere the Taliban flourished. They didn't have to claim falsely that the Indians hated them, for Hindu rightwing leaders were going on and on about it. Free propaganda to brainwash a new legion of followers!  On the Indian side the rightwing political parties like the Shiv Sena had a field day, and caused the BJP to lurch to the right as well. The Pakistani's started a war! Oh happy days for all militant Hindu leader's votebank! A lot of fun was had by many Indian politicians and Hindu leaders, and arguably Kargil gave a major boost to rightwing figures across India, a boost which still lingers on today. A third victor, a minor one though, was assorted defense contractors around the world, who all saw a sustained increase in their sales to the Indian subcontinent. Then you have the House of Saud, who got an increase in ass kissing from various Pakistani leaders to throw more money their way after Kargil dried up international aid. The House of Saud likes ass kissing, and especially likes spreading the Wahabi faith, so Kargil was a double barreled win for them and opened up more pastures to spread their wahabi seed. This tied in with the spread of the Taliban as well, who were the happy recipients of some of this Saudi money. Gen Musharraf personally was a big winner. He lost a minor skirmish in the mountains and somehow gained an entire country. Kargil was Mushie's baby and made him realize he could get away with anything, anything at all. The Pakistan Army still hadn't finished taking back all it's dead when Musharraf moved on to bigger and more ego expanding things than worrying about the soldiers and unidentified whoevers he sent to their deaths and took over Pakistan. The Pakistan Army emerged a huge winner. It's head, Gen Musharraf, annexed a country, Pakistan, to serve the Army. Many Generals, Brigadiers and Colonels became rich and prosperous. Toys were bought, uniforms were upgraded, and many jobs awarded to officers both retired and serving. The Indian Army and Air Force came out winners as well. Though the Army suffered a bunch of scorn for loosing a few mountains in the first place, it also gained tremondous respect for taking them back and got a metric ton of money afterwards to buy more weapons. The Indian Air Force was greatly applauded for managing to throw bombs out of planes while heroically battling of the non-existent Pakistani Air Force response. China was a minor league winner. Pakistan realized it needed more planes than the US/EU was willing to sell it, so Pakistan went China to and bought a bunch of planes, trains and cheap disposable everything as well as doubled down on the old Pakistani slogan, Pak China bhai bhai, frandship deeper than the oceans and higher than the mountains!  A whole legion of Pakistan watchers won. Think tanks spread all over the DC area had a huge win as they finally had something to write about, and a few new think tanks got large chunks of money. A whole new industry of India Pakistan watchers was spawned, and just as things started getting dull 9/11 happened.   The patriotic wing of Bollywood won, for Kargil brought forth a new crop of movies glorying war, soldiers and jingoism. Not many, but still a minor win, for without Kargil some of the new generation of Bollywood stars wouldn't even have thought about paying homage to the Indian soldier.  There are so many winners that it's almost possible to forget that over a billion people lost the war. Kargil was such a non war that sometimes it's importance is lost, but important it was and remains. ",
