            "answer_text": "Will the UK survive the next century? I take it you mean will it survive the next hundred years as the next century is still eighty years away . I can't see it lasting in its present form for another twenty years . Interestingly I saw Michael Gove on TV doing a post election analysis and he made mention of a united federal Ireland between north and south . That's the first time I've heard a politician suggest some sort of federation as a way of uniting Ireland and hopefully appeasing those in the north who would balk at a full blown merger . As for Scotland . The present divide between the Scots political aspirations and those of us south of the border is surely untenable . It must only be a matter of time before they vote in their own referendum to leave the UK . That leaves only Wales and England . Would we still call it the United Kingdom or simply refer to it as England and Wales ? ",

            "answer_text": "No it won\u2019t. It is finished. The break up of the UK, independent Scotland, reunited Ireland, will happen in the next few years. Wales may leave or stay with the sinking English ship. Perhaps about 50/50 on that. Many English can\u2019t handle their reduced status in the world. They still like to think of themselves as an important country, an imperial power, who can just send in the gunboat if anyone doesn\u2019t like what they say. With the Brexit vote, the English voted to reduce the country\u2019s stature even further. So, yes, the break up of the UK is imminent. ",
