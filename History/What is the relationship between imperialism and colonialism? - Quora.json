            "answer_text": "Colonialism is an aspect of imperialism, but imperialism can't always be the same. Colonialism implies territorial expansion. Imperialism pretty much transcends that. Imperialism involves the process by which nations and powers expand and influence other polities. It doesn't necessarily have to involve colonialism. Colonialism is the process by which those smaller polities are assimilated or coerced into being inducted into the sphere of influence of the hegemon or patron-state. The process usually involves some form of territorial expansion and involves establishing an active military and administrative presence in the colonised polity for an indefinite period of time. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define the terms. Imperialism is basically when one country extends its rule over other countries. Colonialism is when the country at the centre of the empire sends its citizens out to live in other countries of its empire, initially with the aim of strengthening its control. But after a few generations the colonists identify less with the metropolitan country and want to rule themselves, and this gives rise to a slightly different meaning of colonialism. In the late 19th century, for example, the Cape Colony in southern Africa was self governing, but the imperialist Conservative Party government in the UK sent Alfred Lord Milner to be Governor. Milner was an imperialist, that is, he wanted there to be an Imperial parliament in the British Empire, to which all the colonies, like the Cape Colony, would send representatives. But there was a \u201ccolinialist\u201d party in the Cape Parliament who opposed this, and wanted greater powers for the local parliament. So in that period, \u201cimperial;ism\u201d meant the centralisation of power in the empire, while \u201ccolonialism\u201d meant the devolution of power to the colonies. This is important to bear in mind when reading contemporary literature and newspaper polemics. ",
