            "answer_text": "Sure they can. The URL is sent across their network and while they cannot see the content of the page as it goes across their network due to the https encryption, they can simply visit the page themselves using the same url and get the content. You can of course prevent this from happening by using a VPN such as NordVPN or another provider. The ISP will only see that you connected to a VPN and not what YouTube video you are playing. The VPN provider will know though. If you want further anonymity, you can also use Tor Browser, but your ISP will know that you are using Tor Browser so use a VPN with that too. Then your ISP will only know that you are using a VPN, your VPN provider will only know that you are using Tor, and some random Tor node will only know that someone they don\u2019t know is watching a YouTube video that they can\u2019t see the content of directly. But why all the secrecy over a YouTube video? What kind of videos are you watching? ",
