            "answer_text": "One way of looking at the World Wars is that they are really a single conflict that started in 1914 and ended in 1945, with only relatively brief periods of actual combat. World War I did not really have a decisive end; Germany sought the armistice because it understood continuation of the war into 1919 would lead to a more decisive defeat and because shortages of food would reach critical levels by mid to late 1919 if the allied blockade was not lifted. But the German army was not really defeated and German territory itself was not invaded. So\u2026it\u2019s likely that some future conflict would have occurred to bring about a permanent resolution of the Great Power rivalries that caused World War I in the first place. That being said, both the timing and nature of the conflict that became World War II were strongly influenced by the Treaty of Versailles. The damage the treaty did to the German economy contributed to the economic conditions that led to the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the rise of the Nazi party. The anger over the way Germany was treated at the Versailles conference and the negative consequences of the treaty, including the loss of German national territory and colonies and the humiliations of having demilitarized zones imposed inside Germany and the imposition of massive reparations created a pretext for the Nazis to mobilize the German people to right these perceived wrongs and support a new campaign of military expansion. So it\u2019s very hard to separate out the conflict that happened from the treaty which created the conditions, particularly inside Germany, that encouraged that conflict to arise. But it\u2019s also difficult to imagine what a Versailles Treaty that did NOT create at least some of those conditions would look like. The Treaty of Versailles was very harsh toward Germany, in ways that the German government and the German delegation to the peace conference clearly had not expected. But unless the treaty had allowed Germany to retain some or all of the territory that Germany had taken from Russia under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, or had otherwise acknowledged that Germany would continue to play a major role as a dominant European and imperial power, Germany would still have walked away from the conference with a sense of grievance. Britain and France simply could not walk away from Versailles with an agreement that rewarded Germany for its role in the war or maintained the specter of a powerful Germany in the aftermath of the war. Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau, the leaders of Britain and France, respectively, during the Versailles Conference, were trying to hobble Germany as a way of making war LESS likely by leaving Germany without the resources or ability to wage it. They failed \u2014 and feared even as they were doing it that the harshness of the treaty may backfire \u2014 but even if they had gone easier on Germany they could not have faced their own people without some sense that Germany was in a weaker position after the war than it had been before it. The political pressures on them were too great. As for Japan, the Versailles Treaty had less to do with Japan\u2019s role in World War II, though Japan, who fought on the Allied side in World War I, clearly thought there\u2019d be more Western acceptance of Japanese Imperial ambitions after the war was over than there actually was. World War II in Asia was driven by a number of factors; the path toward that conflict was probably set at least as far back as 1905, when the U.S. negotiated a peace treaty between Russia and Japan in the Russo-Japanese War that basically left Japan as the dominant power in the Western Pacific. The relative weakness of China and Japan\u2019s need for natural resources also played a role, as did increasing American interest in projecting power into the Western Pacific to maintain access to China as a market for American goods. This had been the motivation for the U.S. acquisition of the Philippines and Guam from Spain, and its decision to annex Hawaii, all in 1898, and the acquisition of other Pacific territories like Wake Island and American Samoa in 1899. These American colonies were acquired at least in part by the U.S. to serve as waypoints and refueling stations for the U.S. Navy as the United States cast its eye toward Asia. So on the one hand in the Pacific you had Japan, starved for resources but surrounded by resource-rich, weak and poorly defended lands in China and Southeast Asia, believing that it had been given a free hand to expand, including by the United States in 1905 when it effectively removed Russia as a major rival to that expansion, and resenting European colonies in resource-rich areas like the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) where there was valuable oil Japan needed. And yet on the other hand you had the United States, which increasingly viewed economic access to China as important to the growth of the U.S. economy and therefore pursued an imperial policy to maintain Pacific colonies that would help it project power toward China in pursuit of the \u201cOpen Door Policy\u201d that was intended to prevent formal colonization of China by other powers so American businesses would still have access to China as a market to sell American goods. Conflict in Asia was probably inevitable regardless of how World War I ended. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably. By the standards of past great wars, Versailles was not that harsh (on Germany). It lost territory, but not core German lands. The indemnity was smaller than that Germany imposed on France in 1870. The military restrictions were severe, but could have been negotiated away in time (as the ones on Russia had been after the Crimean War). What made Germany post WW I different was the resolute refusal of the German elites (army officers, industrial leaders, landowners) to accept social democracy and the liberal international order. They spent the decade undermining Weimar, evading civilian control and backing extreme right parties. They thought they could control Hitler, but he controlled them. But they went along because they shared the same vision - conquest in the east and an end to democracy at home. They needed a war for both - as they had in 1914. ",
