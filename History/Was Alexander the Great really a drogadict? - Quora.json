            "answer_text": "There are some scholars/historians that think Alexander the Great was a drug addict based on stories from that time but this cannot be a definitive yes because it\u2019s built on inference. For example: Alexander identified with his hero Achilles, insatiably ambitious and he set out to exceed the deeds of mythical figures (like Hercules); He was laugh-in-the-face-of-death brave, leading his armies literally as well as figuratively; He unified the Greeks, destroyed the Persian Empire and conquered lands from Greece to Egypt to Pakistan and into modern India, all 300 B.C.when technology was more-or-less limited to chariots and harsh language. Military historians class him among the greatest tactical generals of all time There are stories about him & his soldiers drinking wine, and one must remember that back then their wine was not diluted like the wines of today but were stronger, more like whiskey. It would be reasonable to assume he could have become an alcoholic\u2026 and in his latter years, his statesmanship worsened which could be attributed to alcoholism, and he died at the early age of 32.

            "answer_text": "In as much as alcohol is a drug (even if, for some reason, it gets a pass in most societies), yes he was. He was famous for his drinking. In those times, most people mixed water into their wine to dilute it. Not Alexander. The histories make a point of telling us that he drank it, unmixed. This is probably a little bit of propaganda as well, letting history know just how \u2018manly\u2019 Alexander was. He killed one of his best friends in a drunken rage, as well as pissing off his father, the king, while pished, at a wedding. It was probably drinking that killed him at 32. Which, if you were a people anywhere East of Greece, was probably a cause for a little celebration of your own. Alcohol dependency is a real thing, and prolonged, heavy bouts of drinking do enormous, even fatal, damage to the system. ",
