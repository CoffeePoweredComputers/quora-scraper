            "answer_text": "I think that I should disputed the lengthy answer written by my predecessors. No-one can really tell who they are since we have no clue as to who were these ancient peoples or what they looked like. We can only speculate. The history of this small strip of land between the Mediterranean and river Jordan is well recorded, at least since Roman times. We have no information of annihilation or deportation of local population carried out by external forces. However, the original Jewish population has been dwindling even before the Roman occupation (1st century AD) and was probably replaced, at least partially by Roman army men (Already mainly of Germanic origin). Later, Muslim invasion has probably also donated some fresh genes into the local bloodstream not to mention 20th century immigration from neighbouring countries as Syria and the Lebanon. So, to sum this up, we can say that the current day Arabic people of the west bank of the Jordan are probably the descendants of Judea (=Jews) that mixed with the flux of invaders. Does it really matter? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Palestinians are the same as their pre Islamic, ancient people. Some of their tribes migrated south into the Arabian peninsula. The ones that migrated south were only called Arab because of the area where they began to live It is just the same as the English who moved to Australia, who were then known as Australian, because of the geographical location where they started a new life. The word Philistine and Palestine are both used in the Earlier translation in the bible. When the New International Version of the bible was released in the 1970s, they went out of their way to replace Palestine with Philistia, where ever it showed up in scripture. Joel chapter 3 verse 4 is a very good example of this. Palestine is the King James version, but in the NIV Philistia is used. The reason? One can surmise that in the early 1600s when the King James was published, there was no movement to discredit Palestinians. The book of Joel itself was written in 835BC , during the existence of the Israelite kingdoms. Then we must also remember that kingdoms existed in Palestine long before the Jacob , the father of the Israelites was born. Abraham sought permission from a Palestinian king named Abimelech, in order graze his sheep in his kingdom. Abimelech was just one king, Palestine like many other lands, had multiple kingdoms, ruled by separate kings. The Canaanites were only one tribe of Palestinians. The Canaanites, sons of Canaan, who was the son of Ham, who was the son of Noah, were closely related to the Israelites. By blood. Other Pre Islamic Palestinian tribes were, the Edomites, sons of Esau, the brother of Jacob. Ammonites, sons of Ammon, who was the son of Lot, nephew of Abraham. Moabites, sons of Moab, who was also the son of Lot. There were also the Amorites and Phoenicians , however I am still researching their origins. Here is a very good example of blood relationship. We all know King David, was an Israelite correct? Did you know that Goliath was his direct cousin? It is astounding that almost no one ever teaches this. How are they related? Davids grandmother was Ruth, the same from the book of Ruth. She was a Moabite (Palestinian), not an Israelite. Her sister Orpah, was Goliaths mother. You must make the effort to dig deep, because the movement to discredit Palestinians is very strong. The language now known as Arabic, was spoken long before the Bronze age. It was a standard language spoken in the middle east since the BC period. They all spoke it. ",
