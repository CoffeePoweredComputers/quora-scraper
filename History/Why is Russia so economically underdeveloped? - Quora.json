            "answer_text": "During the era of Communism, The Soviet Union (with twice as many people as current Russia) had a much higher rate of economic growth than Europe or the US. Under Putin, after the Yeltsin collapse in the 90\u2019s, brought on by conservative free market shock therapy (selling off public assets at pennies on the dollar), which brought the per capita income to $2K a yr, the GDP has tripled and wages, adjusted, have doubled. In 2012, for the first time, Russia was ranked as a high income nation. While the per capita income rose to $14K a yr, consider that Russians have universal healthcare and education, at a fraction of the cost of the US, and that 80% own their homes. So a household with two workers (ie income of $28K) has no health or education or mortgage bills to pay. Many in the US pay 30\u201350% for housing, while in Russia, most pay nothing. Also most Russians have gardens and are able to lower food costs (already low) by growing their own. Thus, Russians are doing better than ever with an economy that gets 16% of its revenue from oil/gas, a commodity that will never lack for customers and prices up 30% in the last year. They also have extensive manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, and research (as in rockets, space, medicine, etc). They have never been richer, and the sale of cars is like a stampede. And the future looks bright: they have among the world\u2019s greatest reserves of oil and gas, forests, water, and minerals. They are one of the few places on earth where there is a vast expanse of fertile land that has not yet been developed for agriculture. The Western lies of the Russian economy being crippled is refuted by the fact that after a gain of 300% in GDP since 2000, the drop due to external factors like sanctions and the oil price war, is about 5%. The drop in wages, after rising by 700% since the 90\u2019s, has been about 7%. Russians can live with this and do not blame Putin or the government; 3/4 of Russians support Putin. Compare to the 1/3 who support Trump, the 1/6 who approve of Congress. The USSR, in WWII, lost 25 million citizens as 90 thousand villages and towns were destroyed. They survived and came back\u2026..tho not as quickly as Europe, which was given the Marshall Plan, or the US, which was the economic beneficiary of WWII. But today, Russians are richer, and freer, than ever in their history, with huge alliances with China, India, Europe (who still depends on Russian energy), Brazil, Africa, Syria, Iran, etc. The lies about crippling and isolating Russia, which had a huge surplus cushion and 1/7th the debt of the US, was just propaganda. Russians are better off than ever\u2026and their future looks bright. Better to be low and rising (they are at the bottom of the high income nations, with the 12th largest economy in the world) than high and falling. And that is why they are happy with Putin, their government, and the direction they are going. Of course they have problems, but their amazing success in the past 20 years is unprecedented in modern history. Undeveloped? Hardly. Russians now have one car for every 3 people, 80% own their homes, and wages are 7 times higher than 20 years ago. And the bonus is that unlike most nations, Russia has huge room to grow\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a variety of reasons, the most fundamental being Russia\u2019s access to seas and oceans has been historically limited, and Russia\u2019s maritime communications lagged behind those in Western Europe and the Americas. This complicated trade and moderated economic growth.Most of Russia\u2019s territory suffers from inhospitable climates and relatively infertile soils, complicating agriculture and creating an unattractive living space. As a result, Russia\u2019s Asian part and Northern regions are very sparsely populated. In this regard, Russia is similar to Canada and Australia (but those two countries have excellent ports).Russia historically lagged behind the West in economic, social and political reforms, as well as (until the 1950s or so) in science and technology. This led to loss of productivity, as well as internal and external conflicts, and various forms of violence, which undercut population growth by millions at various times and undermined economic growth. There were a number of notable attempts to leap forward and a number of prominent reformers, including Peter the Great. However, in many cases reforms backfired (example: Stolypin\u2019s reforms) and attempts at imperial expansion and grandstanding (such as the war with Japan and Russia\u2019s participation in WWI) made things much worse. The 1917 revolution, the subsequent Civil War, and Stalin\u2019s purges of 1930s take special places in this line of disasters.In the long term, economic development is more correlated with population than with territory, and Russia hasn\u2019t treated its population very well. The Russian Empire was among the most populous countries in the XVIII and XIX centuries. Today, the Russian Federation is only about 2% of the world - partly because it lost control over densely-populated territories, partly due to emigration, but most of all due to low population growth. Territory correlates with natural resources - Canada, Australia and Norway illustrate how countries with small populations but great natural resources can be prosperous. These examples also illustrate the importance of peace, collaboration, and up-to-date technologies - Russia historically under-performed on those. ",
