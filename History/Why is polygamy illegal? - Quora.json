            "answer_text": "I am going to ignore all of the cultural and moralistic reasons and give you a practical reason for the illegality of polygamy.  In the US, people who are married receive many, many benefits. These benefits are quite expensive for the government. Which means that they are quite expensive for us.  For example, if you are married, and one spouse dies, the other spouse, even if they never worked, can receive the first spouse's social security. Let's say we have a husband who has two wives. He dies. He paid into social security one time throughout his life. But each wife would be entitled to his social security benefits. I don't know about you, but my lizard brain, which knows that my taxes are paying for these benefits, is very unhappy with this idea. That brain goes, hey, wait a minute, he paid in once, that means he covered one spouse. Why the heck do we have to pick up the shortfall?   Think also about employers. What do they do if they provide insurance for the employer and a spouse? Now will the employer be expected to pick up a second spouse? Or a third spouse? Is that fair? Now add this issue up over and over again. You have one bread winner, be it a male or female bread winner, and yet have to pay out benefits for two or three spouses.  Of course, my argument fails in some cases. For example, if you marry one person, divorce him after 10 years and remarry, and stay married for at least 9 months before you die, both of those spouses will get your social security anyway. But that is a unique issue. Most of the time, the benefits incur to the actual spouse upon death. What about disputes? You have two husbands and the wife is in the hospital. Legally, both husbands have an equal say in what happens to the wife. They disagree. What does the hospital do? Well, I guess it ends up having to go to court to get an answer.  Beyond that, let's say we could figure out a fair way to manage these issues. We could, if we wanted to, I am sure. We would have to make a lot of changes to the law. And goodness knows, Congress can barely tie its own shoes these days, never mind rewrite the tax code, family law, estate law and who knows what else. States would have to change a lot of laws as well. This alone would delay the acceptance of polygamy in our country. Again, leaving aside all of the moral and religious issues. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the other answers focus on why polygamy is still illegal, I find the story of how it became illegal at the national level very interesting.  At least in the United States of America, polygamy has never been part of the accepted cultural norms. Which isn't to say that is was always illegal.  The picture is a bit muddy, but the practice of polygamy was known among some indigenous tribes, trappers, Utopian communities, families from other cultures that practiced polygamy in the Old World (i.e. Scots-Irish, Welsh and Muslim), and there is some evidence it may have been occasionally practiced in the South.  By the 1830s, polygamy was illegal in some of the states, but it didn't really appear as a national issue until just prior to the Civil War.  The primary reason that polygamy became illegal at the national level is that the America people in general, and the Southern States in particular, hated the LDS church. It's difficult to understate how deep this ran. They experienced mob violence everywhere they gathered, the most egregious example of which was the Missouri Executive Order 44, mandating the extinction or expulsion of the LDS people, which was given in 1838 and was not officially retracted until 1976. While Governor Boggs' actions were inexcusable, the reason for the antipathy was somewhat understandable. Religion was a really big deal at the time (the USA has an interest in religion that waxes and wanes, it was Serious Business at the time), and there's something about being told everything you believe is wrong that rubs people the wrong way. It was worse in the South, a large population of abolitionists founding a city in the Antebellum South, and loudly declaring it was God's Will they did so, would have felt to them like an attack on their lifestyle, culture, and self rule. So they drove them into the territories in the dead of winter. Once the LDS community were established in the Rocky Mountains, the 1862 Morrill Act and 1887 Edmunds-Tucker Act specifically targeted them using the pretext of their practice of polygamy. This allowed the government to seize a large amount of property by disincorporating the LDS church, which held title to community held property - which was almost all of it.  Before the LDS church adopted the practice, no one really cared enough about the people who practiced polygamy to make it a national issue. Even after the LDS church discontinued the practice, there wasn't enough interest to go after the splinter groups like the FLDS that continued to practice polygamy. Currently polygamy is only sort of illegal. The major recent developments have been the FLDS trials, and the Sister Wives lawsuit.  In the first case, polygamy was the least of the charges leveled at Warren Jeffs and the FLDS leadership. They would have gone to jail even if polygamy were legal. In the second case the Brown's filed preemptively, due to the ongoing stress caused by fear of prosecution for going public with their lifestyle. The suit was dismissed because the judge ruled there was no credible fear of prosecution, in the light of Utah's policy of not prosecuting most polygamous families.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy_in_North_America https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Executive_Order_44 http://www.historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/pioneers_and_cowboys/historyofpolygamy.html https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrill_Anti-Bigamy_Act https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmunds%E2%80%93Tucker_Act https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Buhman ",
