            "answer_text": "How were telephones used in the 1930s? They were primitive. All you could do, at least in America, was make a phone call. That is, you dialed the number of the party you wanted to speak to, their phone would ring, they would pick up the instrument at their end and say, \u201cHello,\u201d and you\u2019d have a conversation. Then you\u2019d put your receiver back in the cradle and that would end the connection. If you wanted to speak to someone outside your town or city, you dialed \u201c0\u201d for the operator and gave them the town and number of the party you wanted to speak to. They would make the connection for you. You could ask the operator to \u201creverse the charges,\u201d making it a \u201ccollect\u201d call. When the person at the other end picked up their phone, the operator would ask if they were willing to pay for the call. You weren\u2019t supposed to say anything until they agreed. These \u201clong distance\u201d calls could be expensive. If you wanted to speak to somebody overseas, you asked the operator to arrange a connection, but usually it took a while and the operator would call you back when things were set up. Such calls were quite expensive. The telephone and wires didn\u2019t belong to you but to the phone company. When you wanted phone service at a new address, you made arrangements for a new connection and somebody came out with a truck and equipment and set it up, giving you a phone. For an extra fee you could get an extension on the same line. There were different prices for different service. To save money you might get a \u201cparty line,\u201d where a number of households shared the same line but had different numbers. As I recall it, the phone rang differently if the call was for your number. If you wanted to make a call and picked up your phone and somebody else was using the party line, you could hear both ends of their conversation. You were then supposed to hang up and try again later. If you wanted to be rude you could speak and they\u2019d hear you \u2014 like, you could tell them you had an emergency, or say they were hogging the line. ",
