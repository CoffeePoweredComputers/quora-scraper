            "answer_text": "Why is the historical European crossbow handle or mechanism straight? What is the reason or advantage compared to the Chinese crossbow version? I suspect it was because of the placement of the nut holding the string. The older style of European handgonnes had their touchole far forward so serpentine levers used to hold the match had very long levers.   Later when barrels got longer and the wooden stock shrunk and started being shouldered the lever was moved backward allowing for a much shorter lever trigger  When spring based locks started being used along with button releases and modern triggers the lever operated spring locks continued being used for centuries     Some Chinese matchlocks also have a lever trigger  At any rate my idea was that because European style crossbows often had short drawlengths and a rolling nut that sat far forward a longer lever was needed to operate it. The right hand being much further back on the stock.    Notice the distance between the nut and the end of the stock. You wouldn\u2019t want to put your right hand too far forward as it might be awkward and hinder aim.   Another thing levers do is grant a mechanical advantage meaning you can exert greater power at the expense of having to move a longer distance. Since European crossbows toward the heavier end of the scale could be extremely hard to draw back the pressure on the nut must have been significant. This could mean the long levers might aid in an easy trigger pull. On the other hand even crossbows suspected of having wooden prods and thus a much lower drawweight had very long levers and some steel crossbows which had high draw weights had a short stock and short levers which suggests it was only really the length of the stock that determined the length of the lever. Contrast the medieval depictions of wooden crossbows with some modern composite replicas and extant ones.     This 15th century one showing steel or composite shows a direct correlation between stock length and lever length    Long stock = long lever and short stock = short lever?        This is just a sample and an amateur\u2019s observation but it seems to me like the length of the trigger lever is related to how long the stock is. The further the stock goes back the longer the lever has to be to accommodate for this and allow it be operated. Why this difference in stock length existed I do not know but I suspect longer stocks might aid accuracy whereas smaller stocks allowed for smaller more conveniently sized crossbows used on horseback or for hunting. The Chinese crossbow you showed were of a type that had bronze triggers which could be easily mass produced by casting and regular molds. Notice that the nut or tumbler holding the string is exactly where the trigger is. This is possible because the string is drawn back almost to the end of the stock.    You wouldn\u2019t want to put these on a western style crossbow. Look at the photo below and try to imagine the trigger being where the nut is located. It would be an ergonomic nightmare.  It would be a bit like putting the trigger of a Garand rifle halfway down the barrel. Maybe an idea for Californian gun legislators?  Likewise putting a western long lever style strigger on a Chinese crossbow would result in an awkward device with the trigger extending to far back. I don\u2019t really think either style of trigger is superior, rather they were intended for different types of crossbows who had very different requirements for trigger placement. Now this begs the obvious question as to why western style style crossbows had the nut much further forward than Chinese style crossbows. I suspect the reason is the design philosophy. Mike Loades suggested Chinese style crossbows might have originally been intended to allow levies untrained in archery to shoot composite bows. If composite bows were captured they could easily be turned into crossbows with nothing more than wooden stocks and a simple to produce triggers.  Of course higher drawweight specifically made composite prods existed but these still operated on the same principle of having a long drawlength like bows. Western style crossbows operate on a completely different principle. Initially they were made of wood and later composite material and lastly steel. However they weren\u2019t bows latched to stocks but rather completely different types of springs. Take this wooden crossbow from Glasgow, it\u2019s not like a common longbow on a stock but rather a chunky piece of timber. Manuscripts can sometimes be hard to decipher but they too show quite considerable prods on crossbows I suspect to be wooden.  Some sinew backed wooden crossbows are the same like this one from Medieval Spain.      Composite crossbows largely follow the same design parameters, chunk and short.  These western style crossbows used much stiffer springs, shorter drawlengths and short stout bolts. Owing to the short movement of the limbs and their heavy weight they would quite efficiently transfer a great deal of power to a short dart like projectile. Said projectile would be short ranged but extremely powerful. Bows with a longer drawlength used springs with a lower spring constant and longer thinner arrows. They would surely fire further but lose a lot more of their power due to friction. ",
