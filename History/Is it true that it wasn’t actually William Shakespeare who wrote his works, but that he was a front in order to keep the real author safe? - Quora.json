            "answer_text": "If history\u2014especially recent history, thanks to the democratization of media platforms\u2014tells us anything at all, it\u2019s that the foolish love conspiracy theories. Who killed JFK\u2014was it Kermit the Frog? Was Elvis still alive? How about Jim Morrison? These were quaint presages of the age of anti-vaxxers, Benghazi, Pizzagate, and so on. But the Shakespeare thing is peculiar. The professoriate keeps telling these putzes: you\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re wrong. History doesn\u2019t bear this out. Stylometry doesn\u2019t bear this out. No, it wasn\u2019t Marlowe. No, not Bacon. No, not de Vere of Oxford. But those ivory tower elitists, what do they know? Study a subject at the highest level your whole life\u2014what kind of qualification is that? They, we, all readily acknowledge that Shakespeare often collaborated, but he did so with other playwrights of his age. People like Thomas Middleton. Not people like Edward de Vere. But what\u2019s strange is that somehow the anti-professorial conspiracist view wants to take a man who emerged from obscurity to find success through a modicum of education and an astonishing natural insight into human psychology and motivation and ambiguity\u2014a non-elite writer, except for his talent\u2014and bestow his plaudits on some rich prick. Never mind that Edward de Vere\u2019s acrimonious relationship with Sir Philip Sidney was well-known; he would joyfully allude to Sidney\u2019s work on many occasions. Never mind Shakespeare\u2019s friends published the First Folio of his plays; never mind that Ben Jonson wrote one of his greatest poems for that volume, speaking of Shakespeare as his beloved friend and proclaiming him greater than the Greek dramatists he so admired; never mind that the young Milton wrote one too; all of these people were in collusion to deceive posterity about a man they could not have known would outlast them all. Jonson\u2019s encomiastic line, \u201cnot for an age but for all time,\u201d belongs to a long tradition of panegyric. Did he know this folio of plays attributed to this friend of his would eclipse them all? And the manuscript tradition\u2014such a mess. Just as a nobleman would have wanted it. (Had they been manuscripts of coterie verse, he might have. But these were celebrated public entertainments. There were copies about.) I\u2019ve given it too much oxygen. Why? Because people have something iconoclastic in them? Because it galls some people that an obscure man could make so much more of his short span than they? Because nursing false ideas about secret cabals is easier and (they think) more fun than seeing Shakespeare performed or reading his works? Who knows. But once the bullshit snowball starts rolling downhill, watch out. Conspiracies get spun up into entire cultural counternarratives. What is it they say about the biggest lies? But of course the big lie is that the man Shakespeare/Shakspere/Shaxberd, the one Shakespeare\u2019s contemporaries, some of whom didn\u2019t like him, all acknowledged to be a playwright of their time, was the author of Shakespeare\u2019s plays. What I want to know is why Orville Redenbacher is not under consideration. Or Hillary Clinton, for that matter. And why isn\u2019t there an active controversy about whether Thomas Dekker wrote his plays? Funny how this should alight on the preeminent writer in Anglophone literature. What remains \u201call men\u2019s suffrage\u201d among the actual experts in this field is that the conspiracy theory is BS. And yet I will have to shut off comments, or off they\u2019ll go! Can you tell I find this whole debate irritating? ",

            "answer_text": "The querent would do well to consult first the definition of argumentum ad populum, sometimes called \u201cthe bandwagon fallacy,\u201d or put in somewhat more vulgar terms: Eat shit! One hundred billion flies cannot be wrong. First, Shakespeare-authorship conspiracies have been with us for a while. They are simply conspiracy theories without any substance. The \u201ctrue identity\u201d attributed to Shakespeare varies from Francis Bacon to Christopher Marlowe to Edward de Vere to Emilia Bassano Lanier to Queen Elizabeth I to probably ancient astronauts and time travelers. No evidence worthy of the term has been produced that would support any of these wild-ass theories. All of them start with some sort of specious \u201cgee, what-if\u201d speculations, then build elaborate towers of babel atop that marshy and uneven base. All these theories have been debunked over and over. To continue to resuscitate them and keep sending them out to distract us is not simply tedious but a waste of our time and energy. One can speculate on the reasons that a number of journalistic types have published books in recent years on the de Vere theory. Most of those analyses would not be complimentary, so we should refrain. A point about some of these idiotic conspiracy books. Some of them actually expend a lot of time and effort and scholarship to dredge up real historical information about people like de Vere and about the society. These parts of their books are actually interesting \u2014 but you need to edit out the bullshit parts where the writer uses his speculations as a springboard into cloud-cuckoo land. To name one book that I found interesting and amusing once divested of its crank-literature conspiracy theories, I submit the case for Ogburn\u2019s The Mysterious William Shakespeare. There was a lot of nice historical reportage in that book. It was in other ways completely f*cking bonkers, but I found the documented historical parts of interest. Ultimately, I suspect that we can assume that books (not a lot of books, but there are indeed books) have been written on this topic because conspiracy theories sell (see the von Dan\u00efken books on aliens for example) and because people are credulous bobos and are too lazy to discover the facts, which would cause them to dismiss Shakespeare conspiracy books as only so much bat guano. There are a lot of people these days who also believe the Earth is flat. We don\u2019t take them seriously, either. Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur. ",
