            "answer_text": "One of the greatest desires of people is to become powerful. When you have power, you can enjoy a good life and people have to obey your orders. Power is so much valued by most people that God is often called \u2018Omnipotent\u2019 or all powerful. Hence, if you have great power, you feel like God who can make or break the life of people. It is, therefore, no wonder the most people crave for power. In the modern world, the most powerful person of a country is usually the democratically elected Prime Minister or President. All people seeking power would like to achieve these position without understanding the responsibility that comes with power. Yesterday, I was watching a TV news channel which showed Mr Imran Khan, the Prime Minister of Pakistan crying secretly.[1]  Why was he crying when he is one of the most powerful persons of his country and he had worked so hard to achieve this position? The reason is that great power always comes with great responsibility. If you are the head of your family, you are responsible only for the members of your family. However, if you are the head of your country, you are responsible for the fate of all the people of your country. If any wrong happens with your people, you feel responsible for it. It is, therefore, important for us to understand that power is not for enjoyment, but for fulfilling responsibilities that comes with power. If you get power and unable to fulfill the responsibilities, you shall only get the curse of the people. Hence, the same power would become a source of pain, anguish and frustration for you rather than being a source of joy, pride and prestige.

            "answer_text": "We have two examples of \u201c with great power comes great responsibility \u201c - one the Honourable president of united states of America , Hon. Donald Trump and second the Honourable prime minister of india Hon. Shri Narendra Modi , both these men are seated in responsible and powerful seats and they like or they don\u2019t like they have been entrusted with great responsibility to overcome the pandemic which plagues their country as well as the globe . Once a common man walked to King Democles and expressed his desire to seat in the kings throne for a day , Democles a kind hearted king agreed and promised him to come next day and offered him the throne however he tied a naked sword to a hair with its aim on the throne . On being questioned by the common man he told him so it was - poor man sweated all through the time he sat on the throne and left early . So it is in real life all posts of power has great responsibility over them and if they are functional then undoubtedly they are fulfilling the responsibility to their best ability . ",
