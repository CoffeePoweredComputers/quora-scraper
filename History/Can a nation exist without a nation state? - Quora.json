            "answer_text": "To understand this one need to first understand what the 'nation' and 'state' means, and how are they different from one another. Let me start by adding the disclaimer that i am not a student of political science (although my academic training is in social sciences), and my knowledge of this particular issue is based on casual reading. 'State' refers to, in a way, sovereignty. An organization that has control over certain spatial unit. This control may be forced by army, may be the extent to which it has legal domination, or the region it taxes etc. For example, if UK has sovereignty over Falkland island and international community accepts, it's part of English state. Now colleagues at political science would laugh at such a definition, but for our purpose it would suffice. On the other hand nation is a completely intangible and abstract concept and thus extremely difficult to theorize. To put iit briefly, if a group of people associate themselves with a certain territorial unit and considers themselves at one with that place, then that territory becomes a nation. For example the people of France consider a demarcated territorial unit to be their country; it may or may not be the same unit controlled by the French government, but if the majority people considers it to be their country, then it becomes a nation. The emotion regarding this feeling of oneness with a territorial unit is called nationalism. There are several reasons behind this though, which can be religion, culture, language, historical existence or any combination of it. The concept of state is as old as organized human existence. The area under Pharaoh's rule would be a state, the roman kingdom would be state or in the more modern period the region controlled by say queen Victoria would be state, or the territory controlled by the government of Indonesia would be state. It is in most cases tangible and measurable. Nation on the other hand is a far younger concept with its origin being not older than 250 years. It was somewhere during the French revolution that some people started to associate themselves with a territorial unit rather than being loyal to kings or chieftains as they traditionally had. The ideal case is obviously when a state or in other word government (they are not same btw), rule a territorial unit which is a nation as well. Case in point are many European countries such as France or Switzerland. This however is hardly the case in real world. Let me give some examples. India is a state which is ruled by one government, but the territory of India is extremely diverse with numerous language, culture, ethnicity and religion all across the country; the territory was held together by the British colonial rule and now part of three independent state of which India is one. The country has multiple nationalities such as Bengali, Marathi, Kashmiri, Bihari etc. and a large number of people would still feel at one with their region than the whole country. Now to what extent 65 years of coexistence has brought a degree of oneness with the country may be a matter of debate, but one can argue that India is a state with multiple nationalities; a country may be somewhat similar to the erstwhile Yugoslavia. Another country one should look at is Cyprus. A small state in the Mediterranean, where half the people considers themselves Greek and another half Turkish. SO essentially Cyprus with a state with no nation. The coexistence may not be peaceful all the time as the Indian case. After the occupation (correct my history if I am wrong) by China Tibet ceased to exist as a state and became a part of China. However to the majority of Tibetan their nation still remains Tibet and not China as that is the territorial unit they associate themselves with. Now to give a more pin point answer to your question, when the geographical boundary of a state (which is a tangible organization) and a nation (which is an abstract concept in the minds of people) coincides, it becomes a nation state. But a nation can and in majority of cases does exists as part of one or many states; example of the former is Tibet or Chechnya and the later being that of Kurdistan or Tuareg land. ",

            "answer_text": "International Relations (IR) Yes, a nation can exist without a 'state'. A nation in the same sense and definition of a state is the same thing. However, a 'nation' can refer to a group of people of commonality. i.e. the 'Nation of Islam' or the 'Christian Nation'. Despite pervious answers, there is no agreed upon requirement for something to be considered a 'nation'. However, to be a formal 'state' there are certain requirements. i.e. population, territory and recognized (in IR) government. It is a bit archaic to term groups of people as a 'nation', but the term is still a term. In IR, 'nation', 'state' and 'country' all kind of mean the same thing and can be interchanged.  The concepts for our modern definition of states is not as old as time. Our modern definition of a state with sovereign rights came about with the Peace of Westphalia, think of the Napoleon era. Contrary to previous comments, again, sovereignty unto the state is a very, very modern development in the history of human interaction. Not even the Greek, and our classical look at democracy gave sovereignty to a state, nation or country.  As simple as this.. before the Peace of Westphalia we had kingdoms, while they might look that same, kingdoms are not the same as a 'state', 'nation' or 'country'. It is kingdoms that are as old as time not states.  ",

            "answer_text": "Sure it can. Native peoples of North America have defied the odds to hang onto their national identities for millenia. There\u2019s a reason why those peoples refer to themselves in Canada as \u201cFirst Nations\u201d. Also, consider the Pashtun of Central Asia. Their homelands stretch from Iran through Afghanistan to Pakistan. They\u2019ve retained their national identity despite one invasion after another for at least 4 millenia. Then there are the Basques whose origin is so ancient they still defy attempts at understanding by historians. I could go on and on but these few examples serve to answer the question. The idea of the \u201cnation-state\u201d is a mere blip on the historical radar, barely two centuries old. In fact, the very idea of the \u201cstate\u201d is merely a by-product of the imperative of national entities everywhere to protect and promote their distinct cultures. ",

What you are asking about nations with weak central structure and strong federal structure. In such countries, the federal states come together to form a union and federations are generally more powerful than the union in most matters of legislation.  So federal structured government is the answer to your question. And countries like Canada, Australia,USA, Pakistan are all federations.   ",
