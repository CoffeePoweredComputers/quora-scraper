            "answer_text": "Why is it, every time there\u2019s some kind of perceived problem in the political realm in this country, that somebody wants the constitution \u201cfixed?\u201d The constitution is NOT the problem and was written for the sole purpose of securing individual rights while setting up a governmental order, where the government only has those powers that we allow it to have (10th amendment). The constitution does NOT need any changing, revising or fixing\u2026what needs to be taking place is we the people demand that the elected representatives and all public servants OBEY the constitution. Thomas Jefferson said: \u201cIn questions of power then, let us hear no more of confidence in men, but bind him down from mischief with the chains of the constitution.\u201d Any time you tinker with the constitutional mandates on government, you\u2019re either opening up avenues for the government to remove your rights or have additional power over your freedom. Remember, when you ask for any \u201cchanging\u201d on the constitution\u2026you\u2019re saying to people, to whom you\u2019ve given power, \u201chere\u2026I see strife, take more power over my freedom, in order to fix it.\u201d You may not realize it and don\u2019t actually use those words, but that\u2019s what will happen. The constitution is the supreme law of the land Article VI, cl 2. Law by its very nature restricts, the law in the constitution restricts government power and when you start changing that basic structural axiom, you\u2019re allowing for those who crave power\u2026to take more of it. We have to start exercising our power, as the owners of the constitution by demanding that public servants obey it\u2026you\u2019re discovering that you can\u2019t vote someone into office and then just trust them to honor their oath, because they\u2019re not. You must read and understand your constitution and do NOT take what any politician or news media clown says it says\u2026it\u2019s called \u201cself government.\u201d ",
