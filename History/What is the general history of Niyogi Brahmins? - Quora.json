            "answer_text": "The Niyogi Brahmins were prime ministers, military commanders, landlords under the kings of the Telugu country. Many became independent kings. They were also poets and writers. They owned vast amounts of lands in the Telugu land, and were rich and prosperous zamindars. Unlike Vadiki Brahmins, Niyogis didn\u2019t engage in priesthood, and were primarily a wealthy influential and dominant community spread across the Telugu land. Niyogi Brahmins were known to be patrons of the Hindu religion, they built temples and donated their wealth to a lot of temple building and maintence. In my own family, my paternal ancestor the Prime Minister of the Mudigonda Chalukaya Empire, by the name of Aitha Raju contributed to the construction of a temple near Hyderabad. My great grandfather Aitharaju Rama Rao, built a Krishna temple in our ancestral village, and contributed land to its maintenance. On my maternal side, The Niyogis of the Chintalapudi village in the Guntur region donated their lands to building a Shiva temple. As the book Medieval Andhra: A Socio-Historical Perspective states \u201cThe Niyogi Brahmins become so invincible that without them a ruler/king couldn\u2019t rule, he held the need to take their help for administration\u201d With genetics, we can clearly assert that the Niyogi Brahmins have origins in Northern India. Niyogi Brahmins are have a complete different cultural leaning than Vadiki Brahmins, Niyogi Brahmins aren\u2019t mentioned in any Telugu literature till the 12 century. http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1812/18120840.htm- The genetics part. Which clearly indicates that Niyogis only came into the Telugu land in the 12 century, by the 14th Century their power spread greatly and kings had to rely on them to administer regions. It is clear that the arrival of the Niyogis from Northern India is poised to be around 12th century. So where did they come from? And why did they come to the Telugu country? The answer lies examining some common Brahmin communities like that of those Niyogis. Like Niyogi Brahmins, we have Chiptavan Brahmins of Maharastra who were prime ministers, kings, and warriors. Bajirao Peshwa was from the Chiptavan community. They controlled the Maratha Empire for generations.The freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar Tilak also hails from this community. Like Niyogi Brahmins, they were landlords and never did priesthood. Another similar community is the Mohyal Brahmins of Punjab. They are described as \u201cThe Mohyal or the Mujhaal Brahmins of the Punjab is a community on which the Punjabis can take pride on. Unlike other Brahmins they did not perform the priestly services like performance of rituals for their clients. Historically, they are the rulers of ancient Punjab and Afghanistan who held sway up to Arabia and Persia. Fair complexioned with sturdy physique, tall these Brahmins today hold important Govt. and business posts.\u201d The ancient India Porus who defeated Alexander the great, when he fought in Pakistan was a Mohyal Brahmin. Porus was a king, who had a vast empire. Another Brahmin community is that of the Anavil Brahmins from Gujarat, they too were prime ministers, warriors, and landlords in Gujarat and never engaged in priesthood. Anavils were pretty politically dominant even post independence. If we examine all the these Brahmin groups closely, they share the same cultural characteristics. But all these groups trace their origins to one story. The story of the Lord Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu. Parasurama is known to have recruited an army of Brahmins who gave up their priestly occupations, to join his army. With his army, Parasurama killed the corrupt Kshatriyas of the world twenty one times. After his campaign, he gave the kingdoms he had won to these army of Brahmins and left to the mountains to retire in peace. The Chiptavans, the Mohyals, the Anavils and the Niyogis all trace their lineage back to the tale of Parasurama and his army. THE HOMELAND HYPOTHESIS Common cultural characteristics and a shared origins story, clearly tell us that all these Brahmin groups were part of the warrior Brahmin group of Parasurama\u2019s legendary army. After he halted his battle, this warrior Brahmin group seems to have lived and thrived in a certain homeland region somewhere in Afghanistan or Punjab or Northern India. Soon a group of warrior Brahmins migrated further, firstly to Gujarat where they might have settled down. Many warrior Brahmin groups made their home in Gujarat, whilst a few Warrior Brahmins made their home in the Konkan Coast only migrating to Maharastra in the late 17th century, where they were given the name Chiptavan. It seems that probable that the Niyogi Brahmins were part of this warrior Brahmin settlements either in Gujarat or the Konkan coast. The Need to bring Niyogis In In the Telugu land, at that time Buddhism and Jainism became dominant religions, and Hindu power declined. The post of the karnamas or village revenue officials was key to village administration, without these posts the kings couldn\u2019t control their regions. Before the arrival of the Niyogi Brahmins into the Telugu land. The post of karnamas were occupied by Buddhists and Jains, and people of the Goldsmith caste. \u201cThe earliest Karnams, of which we know, were Aravas (Goldsmiths), Buddhists and Jains. The resurgence of medieval Hinduism brought about repeated efforts to displace these groups. Successive kingdoms sought to introduce small groups of military and financial officers into the administrative hierarchies and areas under their control. Family elements of these loyal groups would be given dominant positions in carefully selected and strategically important villages. On successive occasions under different regimes, therefore, we know that Benares Brahmans, Hoysala Brahmans, Patrulu Brahmans, Badagal Brahmans, Nandavarika (or Yagnavalkya) Brahmans, (Ayyar or Iengar) Tamil Brahmans, Kanakapillais, Lingayats, Linga or Gazulu Balijas, and Kayasthas, were introduced into various positions of administrative power within Guntur District, or Kondavidu Sima as it was known in pre-Muslim times. But since these groups were numerically small, they retained only isolated pockets of influence in widely scattered villages once their dynastic regimes were superseded 3 The most significant Brahman group to grow strong in Telugu country have been the Niyogis. There are various legends about how this administrative elite originated and how it became predominant in Karnamships. Undoubtedly, Niyogis were locally influential by the middle of the 12th century. it is doubtful whether either Brahminical or Niyogi power triumphed very suddenly. Not until Vijayangara power extended across in the peninsula in the early 16th century did Niyogis reach their greatest power.\u201d From the book Traditional Processes of Power in South India : an Historical Analysis of Local Influence by Robert Eric Frykenberg. We can therefore observe that the need for a Hindu group to administer the villages was rampant in Hindu kingdoms that got back power from the Buddhists in the Telugu land. Most of these Hindu Kingdoms, themselves had Hindu dynasties that had origins in Gujarat, Maharastra or Northern India. Like that of Chalukayas for example. Therefore it might be that six thousand warrior Brahmin families, migrated to the Telugu land to work for these Hindu kingdoms as prime ministers, warriors, and karanamas or village revenue heads. They were called \u201cNiyogi\u201d because it meant employed in Sanskrit. They were Brahmins that were employed. Thus the six thousand Brahmins came in to the Telugu land, soon they became Prime Ministers in dominant kingdoms. And acquired huge amounts of land and wealth for their services becoming wealthy and political influential. A fine example is Tikkana, Niyogi who was a Prime Minister to the king Manumasiddhi of Nellore. He helped him get back power, when Manumasiddhi was dethroned from power. Tikkana\u2019s own cousin brother was Khadaga Tikkana (Khadaga meaning sword). But it wasn\u2019t until the 14th century that Niyogi Brahmins reached the zenith of their political, economical and cultural dominance. They also formed independent small kingdoms shortly after this time. By the 14th Century, Timmarsu was the Prime Minister of the Vijayanagara Empire. When the empire expanded, Niyogi Brahmins became zamindars, army commanders and of course their role as karanamas were retained, and made hereditary. By the time of the Qutab Shahi Muslim kings taking power in the Telangana region, Niyogi Brahmins were a wealthy and dominant community. Akkanna and Madhaana, two Niyogi Brahmins themselves were employed as Prime Ministers in the court of the Muslim king. They were also appointed as army generals, and tehsildars/collectors. A well known Niyogi Brahmin is Kancherla Gopanna/Ramadasu. A huge devotee of Lord Rama, who built Rama\u2019s temple in Bhadrachalam. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kancherla_Gopanna When the empires of kings fell, and the British Empire took over. Niyogi Brahmins were both the most educated and economically prosperous community. The East India Company decided to employ the Niyogi Brahmins for their administrative experience and intelligence was vastly necessary for the Company to function in the Telugu land. By this time, Niyogis were the huge landowning community. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of acres of lands were owned by Niyogi zamindari families in villages of the Telugu land. They were one of the biggest landowning communities. A Niyogi Brahmin by the name of Kasi Viranna, was said to have been the richest merchant in the Telugu land he had his hands on all the English trade on the coast and neighbouring regions. The East India Company even employed a Niyogi Brahmin Governor called Surrena between 1637-41. An English men described the Niyogi Brahmins as \u201cI have seen some men in the course of a few mintues work out to the last fraction, long and complicated caculations, which would have taken the best accountnants in Europe hours to get through\u201d Niyogi Brahmins soon became quite dominant in the Independence movement, with their vast land wealth they were the first group in the Telugu land to acquire English education. With this they came to dominate the Congress of the Telugu land, much of the early Congress leaders in the Telugu land, people like Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitramyya, Tangturi Praskam Panthulu, Burgulla Ramakrishna Rao, PV Narasimha Rao and many others were Niyogi Brahmins. Post land reforms, and after a change of political climate. The Niyogi\u2019s downfall was eventual. They lost their lands, their political power and migrated to the cities. Politics lead many Niyogis to further migrate out of the Telugu land altogether, abandoning any political power they had. The tale of the Niyogi Brahmins with their migration into the Telugu land, began in the 12th Century. They became a wealthy, influential and dominant community and completely exercised immense control by the 14th Century, they maintained their position till the 1950\u2019s. From then began their decline. Presently, the Niyogi Brahmins form roughly about 1 to 1.5% of the population in the Telugu land. The population is fast decreasing with outward migration being the most common reason. We have to see what the future holds for the Niyogi Brahmin community. ",

            "answer_text": "Chalukyas were Shaivaites, but had immense faith in Jainism, so they did patronage Jainism as well to some extent. This has led to strong jain presence in today\u2019s Karnataka.  Kakatiyas gained prominence in 10th century CE, Kakatiyas were Hindus (, helped reconcile Vaishnavites and Shaivites). Most of the employees in the kingdom/empire who work them continued to be Jains. When Kaakati Ganapati Devudu nominated Rudrama Devi to succeed him, the decision is not well taken by many of those times to have a lady lead them. (Rather surprisingly) The employees of that time didn\u2019t show solidarity to the Queen. So, the Queen (with the help of Siva Devayya) sacked those in prominent positions and employed 6000 Brahmins. The word \"Niyogi\" meant to employ/appoint and these people were called Niyogi Brahmins (& some times Aaruvela Niyogulu meant 6000 Appointees)  One more connection being told is few Brahmins came in as aranam to Tamil princess Kundavai (daughter of Raja Raja Chola), when she married Vengi Chalukya King Vimaladitya. It was also said that it is on the advice of Virabhadra Chalukya, Rudrama appointed the kins of those Brahmins as administrators. A Niyogi Brahmin friend of mine told this story and concluded that \u201cNiyogi Brahmin finds roots in Rajamahendravaram\u201d.  Other brahmins (classified broadly as Vaidiki) didn\u2019t take well that Niyogi brahmins performing rituals (vaidika kratuvulu/karmalu) while enjoying the benefits from the treasure. Hence Niyogi brahmins were restricted to karanikam.  You can read more on Kakatiya version in Nori Narasimha Sastry writings on \"Rudrama Devi\u201d. Thanks Mantha Veerabhadram garu for educating me on the name of the writer. ",
