            "answer_text": "Sure there are living descendants. Probably a few million, by now, 735 years after the death death of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, AKA Llywelyn the Last. But there are problems with the title, Welsh unity, suzerainty under the English, primogeniture, etc. Llewelyn was my 20th-great grandfather. As he only had daughters, there was no heir available for his principality, only men being eligible in those days. (Male Preference Primogeniture) The men who killed him served Edward I (Longshanks), who was my 21st-great grandfather, along another line. In 1301, Edward invested his son (later Edward II) as the Prince of Wales, establishing it as the title of the heir apparent. Four other Welshmen claimed the title after 1282 - Llywelyn\u2019s brother Dafydd, Madog ap Llywelyn, Llywelyn\u2019s very great nephew Owain Lawgoch, and finally Owain Glynd\u0175r, who styled himself with that title 1400\u20131409. Though some of the Welsh princes asserted the title themselves, in fact each who held it successfully acknowledged suzerainity to the King of England, and only managed to hold the office with the consent of the English monarch. The fact that the English monarchs for 716 years invested their heirs with the title would seem to indicate they do not favour recognising anyone else as Prince of Wales. The Welsh themselves were not under one single ruler through most of their history. The title was only used by the Welsh a bit over a century. Owain Gwynedd, who had styled himself rex Waliae, adopted princeps Walliae in 1165. Llywelyn the Last was his great-great grandson.  Any person with heirs over 735 years has a huge number of descendants. If each generation only had two children, 23 generations would create 8 million descendants in the present generation. (More, due to larger families; but fewer, due to cousin marriages.) So, there are a lot of descendants of Llywelyn the Last. But none of them are in any position to make claims. And to whom would they make such a claim? To the English parliament, who has ratified the succession of the current line of monarchs? You mentioned reclaiming the title in court. Traditionally, court means the English king. But perhaps you mean the court with magistrates and judges instead of kings and queens. Those would only enforce the law \u2014 which for over seven centuries has given the English monarch the right to name the Prince of Wales, who has been their son and heir. The Welsh cannot reclaim the title without, literally, a fight, and that fight was effectively ended in 1282. ",

He lives in Tywyn (you can read about the family here: Anwyl of Tywyn family - Wikipedia) and has no interest in making anything of his heritage. Not that he really has a claim to anything he doesn't already own. The title was taken from the family (and the Principality of Wales annexed to the Crown of England) in 1282 when Llywelyn rebelled against Edward I, to whom he had sworn fealty. I'm not aware of any legal grounds for claiming it back. Though I suppose he could try force of arms \u2014 on balance, I'm glad that he's not inclined to. ",

Back in 2017, the comedian Greg Davies - Wikipedia appeared on Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series) - Wikipedia which traced a possible line of descent from Owain Gwynedd - Wikipedia (c.1100\u20131170) who was the first person to hold the title \u201cPrince of Wales\u201d. This is not much to write home about, however, as the man had at least 21 children by two wives and at least four mistresses! Consequently, practically anybody whose family has lived in the area for a while more than likely has a trace of his genes somewhere. ",
