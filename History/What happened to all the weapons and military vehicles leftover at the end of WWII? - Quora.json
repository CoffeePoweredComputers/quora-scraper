            "answer_text": "For larger pieces of equipment, such as vehicles of all varieties, a lot of them were simply dumped into the ocean. The US also disposed of some captured or surrendered enemy naval vessels by sending them to the depths of the sea, but not simply by scuttling them. Instead, some Axis ships were used as targets for testing new weapons at sea. These tests frequently involved atomic weapons, as the US was interested in seeing how an atomic bomb would affect ships. A lot of ammunition, from small weapons ammunition to more potent ordnance, was also thrown into the ocean, along w/ a lot of the weapons that fired such ammunition. It has recently become known that not only were bombs, bullets, & weapons dumped into the ocean but also more sinister weapons. 32,000 tons of chemical weapons & ~400,000 bombs & rockets filled w/ sulfur mustard were dumped into the ocean by the Allies. Of course, a great deal of equipment did not go to the bottom of the ocean. Much of it has remained on land, either buried in caches in Europe or abandoned in inaccessible places like the Libyan Desert. Another place where many military vehicles have gone is on the Eastern Front where bogs & marshes provided good conditions for the preservation of those vehicles driven into them. Of course, abandoning, burying, or dumping weapons wasn\u2019t the only way of dealing w/ the sudden surplus of weaponry. Raw materials for industrial production were lacking for most nations after the end of the war, &, particularly for the Soviets, captured & surplus weapons provided ideal sources of metal. Consequently, many weapons were melted & used in manufacturing. Weapons that weren\u2019t abandoned or melted were either sold to other nations or stockpiled for future use. This was particularly true w/ guns. Many WW2 rifles, like the M1 Garand, were stockpiled by various government departments after which they were sold in the following decades to the public or, in the example of the US, made available for purchase by civilians through the government\u2019s Civilian Marksmanship Program. Many rifles from the war were also donated as a part of aid packages. In other examples, rifles were supplied to anti- or pro-communist movements in several nations during the Cold War. Others were used in wars that happened in the decades shortly after WW2 by troops on both sides of the conflict. Some WW2 weapons, like the StG 44, are still in use today in conflicts such as the Syrian Civil War. Finally, many of the more impressive captured or surrendered Axis vehicles, like advanced types of aircraft, submarines, & tanks, came to be in Allied museums or public exhibitions. However, captured prototypes w/ advanced tech were studied secretly by Allied engineers & scientists before being destroyed. ",

WW2 For starters, the M1911 stayed in service relatively unchanged after the war, even till this day[1].  M1911  M1911 used by a modern soldier. Note how little the M1911 has changed Some weapons do remain in service too, but were altered to keep up with the times. For instance, the Lee Enfield No.4, while withdrawn from mainstream service was modified to become a sniper rifle for the post-war UK Military, known as the L42A1 sniper rifle[2].  Lee Enfield No.4  L42A1 Other weapons may also stay in service, but only in ceremonial roles. For instance, the modern US Military uses the M1 Garand only in ceremonial purposes.  M1 Garand  M1 Garand in a ceremonial purpose Leftover weapons were also sold off to other countries to recoup some of the sunken costs. For instance, the US sold off BARs to South Vietnam, which were used to equip South-Vietnamese soldiers.  BAR  South-Vietnamese soldier with a BAR However, some WW2 weapons were captured and sold on the black market and are used by modern-day insurgents.  Black market  Insurgents For instance, this WW2-era M1 Garand was found in an Insurgent\u2019s house in Iraq[3].
