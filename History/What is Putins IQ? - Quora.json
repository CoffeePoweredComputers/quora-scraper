            "answer_text": "He went to one of the 2 best universities in Russia which puts him in the top 0.1% as they only accepted the very best that Russia had and still that is the case. Then he was accepted/recruited into the KGB which only took the very best of the best graduates and they actively sought out the best of the best, you couldn't just apply to join them, and was considered to be the pinnacle of government service so its a fair bet that he is in the top 1% minimum based on KGB recruitment and career progression in the KGB. The fact that he has done an incredible job of getting Russia back on its feet after the chaos and mayhem of the post soviet collapse speaks volumes. He will certainly go down in history as one of the greatest Russian rulers ever so that should put him in the top .1% based on what he has achieved. Having watched him talk in numerous media interviews over the years I would guess top .1% at least. However these are all guesses as noone actually knows ",
