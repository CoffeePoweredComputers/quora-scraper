            "answer_text": "If America had its own polytheistic pantheon, what would their gods be like? This is a novel and a TV series. American Gods. Technical Boy, god of technology.  Mr World, god of conspiracy theories and paranoia about the government.  Media. Goddess of TV, movies, magazines, radio, newspapers, books, etc.  Media 2.0 Goddess of the Web. Email, texting, streaming video, and social media.  Those are just the entirely new Gods. There were also plenty of Old Gods who shrank to insignificance after they immigrated here, and others who adapted and evolved. For example, Eostre went from an ancient fertility goddess, to the goddess of the commercial holiday Easter.   ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean North America or the United States of America\u201d Because North America does have gods. They belong to the Native Americans. However, the United States was founded by mixtures of Christian people fleeing persecution in Europe, such as the Pilgrims, Puritans, Freemasons and others. They wouldn\u2019t establish a polytheistic pantheon of deities. However, the USA does have figures which might be construed as \u201cgods,\u201d like Uncle Sam and Lady Liberty. If you delve into movie iconography, there are movie archetypes that have repeated through film, such as: Cary Grant - the leading manMarilyn Monroe - the love goddessJames Dean - the American rebelTheda Bara - the seductressCharlie Chaplin - the clownI\u2019m sure the list can go much further.
