            "answer_text": "Sort of. But this depends on how you define \u201clandslide.\u201d There used to electoral college landslides where the losing candidate got only one or two or three states. This is no longer possible because of the extreme partisan polarization over the past 40 years. That said, if Biden were to win all the states where he is currently ahead in the polls \u2014 even if only by about 1 percent \u2014 he\u2019d win 406 electoral votes. Trump would be reduced to only 20 states. That would be as close to a landslide as is currently possible. This would mean Biden would take Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Maybe even Iowa. But that may not be a likely scenario. For one thing, Biden\u2019s polling advantage is only around 1 to 3 pts in some of those states \u2014 and that\u2019s within the margin of error of the polls. Moreover, after Labor Day, that\u2019s when the campaigns get really in high gear. The Trump team has a vast cash horde and after Labor Day they are going to unleash an avalanche of mud against Biden and the Democrats. Thus it\u2019s likely the polls will tighten up in the last months before the election. Even so, Trump\u2019s approval rating recently crashed to 36 percent with a disapproval rating at 60 percent. He is the most hated president in the history of polling. And he\u2019s doing nothing to turn that around. The country is going through a huge series of crises \u2014 the coronavirus epidemic has killed 140,000 people, the real unemployment rate is 18 percent and we\u2019re on verge of a possible great depression scenario, and most of the pubic disagrees with Trump on \u201crace relations\u201d and his response to the protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. And Trump is just doubling down in the wrong direction on all these issues \u2014 trying to pretend the coronavirus will go away, pushing reopening of schools and other facilities in a push that would be likely to kill people \u2014 62 percent say opening schools for in person classes this fall would not be safe. I don\u2019t really see anything likely to turn around Trump\u2019s rapidly sliding fortunes. He knows he\u2019s losing. And all he can do is engage in fascist style attacks on protestors, yammer conspiracy theories about \u201cantifa\u201d, continue to try to hide the extent of the coronavirus epidemic, and on and on. Trump is cruisin\u2019 for a bruisin\u2019. But it\u2019s not at all clear just how much Biden will win by. Nor are the Democrats resting on their laurels. They are also very nervous about this and do NOT believe they have this in the bag. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It may be possible that he could win the general election if the Democrats unite behind him, but a \u201clandslide\u201d is unlikely and for a few reasons. Reason One: The country is too partisan and too polarized to allow for it: Regardless of how it started or who started, it the country is far more polarized today than it was a generation ago. This means it will be difficult to have \u201ccompromises\u201d were both sides give up something to get something bigger. Everyone wants everything and all the credit for it if it\u2019s good. This means there is going to be little room for a Republican to back down and vote Democrat or for a Democrat to back down and vote for Trump. Which means it will be hard for any Democrat, even Biden to win in the Midwest and the South. Just as it will be hard for Trump to do well in New York or California. In this, Biden could win if the Democrats unite behind him, should he win the nomination, but it\u2019s doubtful he\u2019s going to overcome the partisanship, which will then narrow the election considerably. Reason Two: The Democrats are too fractious within themselves: And the divisions in the country as a whole are nothing when compared to the divisions within the Democratic Party. Getting Democratic voters to unite behind the Democratic nominee is going to be like herding cats. The voters won\u2019t blindly vote Democrat if they don\u2019t like the nominee. And this is actually something that will likely COST Biden the general election. For the Democratic Party base has already declared they will fight him if he is elected, and given that were only at the start of the primary campaigns says something about that. So, while Biden may win some swing voters, the Democratic base will likely go home and cry that their particular progressive didn\u2019t win the nomination and think that by not voting that progressive will be named President out of sympathy\u2026 and will then cry harder when they learn they get President Trump for another four years. Reason Three: Things are relatively stable economically: While Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t been the miracle recovery he claims them to be\u2026 they aren\u2019t exactly the burning trash heap that they\u2019ve been attacked as either. There may be certain areas where things aren\u2019t going great, but so long as he can present positive numbers in job or wage growth\u2026 Trump will be able to present a reason to re-elect him that WILL be attractive to a fair number of voters and will make Biden\u2019s job tougher. Because he would then be having to present a way to either present an idea that would do better than what Trump will claim or present a believable argument on where Trump\u2019s policies have failed. For so long as Trump can claim success\u2026 it will be hard to get people to switch their votes if they feel comfortable with what they have. What does this mean? It means the election will be narrow, regardless of who wins. People may want a landslide victory for their candidate but in today\u2019s political atmosphere\u2026 that\u2019s not likely. And thinking it will happen is pure fantasy. Biden could win, but it won\u2019t be that much\u2026 and Trump may win again, but it won\u2019t be by that much\u2026 Biden\u2019s Best Results: 2020 Presidential Election Interactive Map This would come from the Democrats uniting behind him and his own moderation being just enough to win a handful of states that may have enough moderate Republicans that are dissatisfied enough to go against Trump. Trump\u2019s Best Results: 2020 Presidential Election Interactive Map This would reflect the partisanship and the fact that A) the economy isn\u2019t tanking and B) the odds are good that the progressives enough would rather suffer under Trump than have Biden. Most Realistic Results: 2020 Presidential Election Interactive Map This will represent a combination of factors. Biden may well win some Republican votes, and that will help flip a state like Michigan, which only just leans to the Left\u2026 but the economy is stable enough that Trump will have enough to win, if only narrowly.

            "answer_text": "He definitely can. In 2016, the people that voted for Trump, didn\u2019t realize what a disaster he would be. Now, nobody\u2019s on the fence about Trump, and even lifelong Republicans are voting for Biden to get rid of him. After his failure on COVID-19, I don\u2019t know why anyone in their right mind would vote for him again. With the electoral college, the only states that really matter are Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Ohio. Arizona has been a red state for decades and not only did Senator Sinema (D) beat McSally, but Mark Kelly (D) is polling ahead of McSally and beating her by a landslide in fundraising. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Arizona went blue in November. The Democrats always do better when voter turnout is high, and voter turnout has been significantly higher in the midterms and the Democratic primary than previous years, even with the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden has 45 years of experience in government and Trump hasn\u2019t learned a thing since taking office. He spends every single day rage-tweeting and watching Fox News when he\u2019s not on a taxpayer-funded golf vacation. Clinton was unpopular and she beat Trump by 3 million votes with low voter turnout. Biden is doing far better in all of the primary states than Clinton did in 2016. Moderate Republicans used to make up a majority of the GOP base. An overwhelming majority of them are so tired of Trump that they would vote for a coma patient if it meant getting rid of Trump. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, although it depends on your definition of a landslide. I\u2019ll go through a few scenarios. Scenario 1- \u201cModest\u201d Landslide  This is actually the current polling map but for a few exceptions. Biden carries Texas and Iowa in this scenario, netting him an additional 44 electoral votes. Although this scenario is unlikely if Trump manages to improve during the fall, it is still possible at least for now. Scenario 2- Not so Modest Landslide  This electoral map starts to become more ridiculous and lopsided as Biden picks up South Carolina, Indiana, Missouri, and Alaska. All three of the states currently show Biden behind 8\u201311 points. Basically Biden would have to improve around 5\u20136% in order to carry these states. Scenario 3- Sea of Blue  This map gives Biden the states of Montana, Kansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. At this point the map isn\u2019t even close to realistic. Scenario 4- 46-State Sweep  This would be nearly impossible, but the states of Oklahoma, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Idaho would still not flip. These states are so solid that they would resist a large landslide, although they might be close. Overall, all of the situations except for the first one are nearly impossible. The first situation resembles the current polling, except for a few additional states. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The Trumpkin posters talk a lot about the 2016 polls, which were only off by about 1 point nationwide but ignored the distribution by state. (Almost no one was polling Wisconsin and Michigan.) But for some reason, they say nothing about the 2018 midterm election: you know, the one where Democratic House candidates outran Republicans by about 8\u00bd points (modern record), and won 40 seats. Maybe the news hasn\u2019t reached Moscow yet. If Biden runs 4 points ahead of Clinton (that is, a little behind the Democratic House candidates), he picks up MI, WI, PA, FL, NC, and AZ. Whether this is a landslide is in the eye of the beholder. I would say yes. It\u2019s a larger margin of victory than 2016. Biden is tied or ahead in current polling in all these states, sometimes by substantial margins. Trump is also at risk of losing states he won comfortably in 2016 (Iowa, Georgia). Biden is not at risk in any Clinton state. You can judge the Republican desperation by the Governor of Georgia\u2019s plan to salvage the state for the Republicans by prohibiting mask ordinances. COVID-19 kills black and brown voters at a higher rate, and the Republicans appear to hope the Grim Reaper will whiten up the Georgia electorate enough to salvage Trump and two Senate seats. ",

Biden will still win if he loses all those states where his lead is 4.3% or less. Trump needs something really big to turn it around, and voters in this election are not moving the way they have in other elections after major events. We saw neither candidate get the usual convention bump, the Russian bounties on U.S. soldiers or Trump calling them \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers\u201d did not cause large shifts, and neither did the debate. Despite lots of flailing about and the usual barrage of childish insults, Trump can\u2019t put a dent in Biden\u2019s favorability numbers. All Trump has been able to do is regain and probably solidify a lead in Texas and creep closer in Florida, where he trails by 2. To win, Trump is probably going to have to take Michigan and Wisconsin, where Biden has leads of 5.2 and 5.5% respectively. Biden has pretty much iced Pennsylvania, cutting off a major path for Trump. ",

There\u2019s a slight chance of Texas flipping as well, which would be intriguing to see. I don\u2019t think a 100% electoral college is possible, though. Wyoming is a stronghold Republican state, and even Biden spending the entire campaign season there probably wouldn\u2019t win him Wyoming (which is a terrible idea, but I doubt Biden would ever step foot in Wyoming this year). There are also few other staunch conservative states in that area that would be very reluctant to vote for a Democrat. ",

It\u2019s all a matter of whether Trump can win those states again, this time running on his (debatable) record and merits, not simply because he\u2019s facing Hillary Clinton, who was an extraordinarily bad candidate that much of the working class found repulsive.

Picking up Pennsylvania, where Biden was born and remains very popular, gets him to 252. Michigan and Wisconsin are well within his grasp, especially if he picks Amy Klobuchar or Gretchen Whitmer as his running mate. That's 26 votes between then. That's 278 and the win before we even look at Florida or Ohio or North Carolina or Arizona. All of which are potential wins for Biden as well, to varying degrees of likelihood. ",
