            "answer_text": "In most cases, metal is anonymous. A bronze statue or golden ring may be a marvel; but once it goes into the melting pot, its history dissolves. We can only know that a given lost artifact was reused in a given way if a written source tells us so - and since metals tend to be melted down in times of war and unrest, we seldom have any such record. I do, however, known of a few instances in which we can trace the re-use of ancient metal. Before losing ourselves in these anecdotes, some thoughts on the probability of your smartphone containing ancient metal. Your phone is almost certain to contain a few atoms from famous ancient sculptures (and for that matter, any number of famous people), simply because atoms are redistributed over time. The odds of a more substantial amount of classical tinsel ending up in your phone are somewhat lower. Smartphones contain (among many other metals) bits of gold, copper, tin, and lead. Each of these metals has been mined extensively since antiquity, but most intensively in modern times. The majority of the copper, tin, and lead currently in circulation has been unearthed in the past two centuries. And according to the World Gold Council (which, I suppose, would know), about two-thirds of the gold now in existence has been mined since 1950. So I would say that, above the molecular level, the odds of your phone's metals coming from an ancient source are relatively slim.  This lion was carved from the capital of a Roman temple On to the more general question of metal recycling. As soon as I saw this question, I thought of Rome. As a Roman historian, admittedly, I think of Rome rather often. But in this case, my obsession is warranted. From late antiquity the nineteenth century, almost every large building project in the city of Rome used marble and / or metal recycled from ancient ruins. Typically, we have only a general idea where the materials from one ruin or another ended up. Yet sometimes, blessedly, the records are a bit more forthcoming. We know, for example, that the sixteenth-century marble lion in Florence's Loggia dei Lanzi was carved from one of the colossal marble capitals of the great temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. We know too that the high altar of St. Peter's Basilica was fashioned partly from a huge block of marble torn from a first-century Temple of Minerva near the Roman Forum. The reuse of metals, though usually less conspicuous, can sometimes also be traced. By late antiquity, the city of Rome glittered with thousands of bronze statues - one sixth-century author estimates that almost 4,000 were displayed in public space alone. The vast majority of these were melted down in late antiquity. Probably the worst offender was the Byzantine emperor Constans II, who spent the majority of his two-week visit to Rome in 663 stripping the city of every usable bit of metal, down to the gilded bronze roof of the Pantheon. (Some of this loot may have found in 1992, when divers near Brindisi discovered the remains of a huge trove of bronze statues, ranging in date from the 2nd century BC to the 3rd century AD. Every statue had been cut up for scrap. It has been suggested that the metal was dumped when one of Constans\u2019 ships either sank or jettisoned part of its cargo.) We can follow a few bits of Roman metal as they moved around. In 630, for example, Pope Honorius I stripped the gilded bronze roof tiles from the Temple of Venus and Rome and used them to repair the roof of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. Some of these tiles survived until 1613, when they were melted down to make the colossal statue of the Madonna that still stands on the huge Roman column in front of Santa Maria Maggiore. In 1626, more infamously, Pope Urban VIII melted down the colossal bronze roof girders of the Pantheon porch, recovering a whopping 400,000 pounds of metal. Some of the metal was cast into 110 new cannons. The rest was used to make the bronze columns of the famous Baldacchino of St. Peter's Basilica. (The baptismal font of the same church, incidentally, was reportedly fashioned from the sarcophagus of Hadrian.)  The Baldacchino, made from the bronze of the Pantheon girders Ancient gold was treated no more reverentially. In 1544, when the tomb of the fifth-century empress Maria was discovered, the beautiful gold jewelry found in the sarcophagus (whose weight reportedly totaled forty pounds) was promptly melted down. Centuries later, when a peasant not far from Rome uncovered a trove of late antique silver dishes (reportedly totaling 30,000 ounces), this too was flung into the furnaces and made into coins. According to Niketas Choniates, the famous bronze statues of the Hippodrome in Constantinople met a similar fate, when the Crusaders pulled them down and minted the metal. We know, in short, frustratingly little about how most ancient metal was re-circulated. But it is possible - if just possible - that your smartphone's circuits contain some bits of copper or tin from the 900 camel-loads of bronze taken from the Colossus of Rhodes, or some shining mote from the treasure of Empress Maria.
