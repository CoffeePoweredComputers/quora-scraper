            "answer_text": "Doggerland was almost certainly part of what archaeologists call the Azilian culture, as were the ancestors of the modern Basques. There is evidence of Basque-like loanwords in the modern languages of the North Sea region. So \u201cDoggerish\u201d may have been a many times removed cousin of modern Basque.  Doggerland at its maximum size about c. 10,000 BCE. The arrows indicate seasonal hunting movements. (Map by Dr Caitlin Green.) Rolf Kohl's answer provides details of the broader archaeological and biological background, i.e. the Doggerlanders were part of the broader Mesolithic culture/s of north-west Europe. I will attempt to supplement this with evidence from historical linguistics. While the Azilian and Maglemosian cultures overlapped in time and were neighbours, the Azilian came first \u2013 and seems linked to the re-settlement of north-west Europe from Iberia, after the last major ice age. The Maglemosian culture appears to be, at least in part, an offshoot of the Azilian. The present-day languages and nationalities of northern Europe are relative newcomers. One of the reasons why we know that the Germanic, Celtic and Finno-Ugric languages are newcomers, in part, is because they are evidently not similar to Euskara (Basque) or other members of the Vasconic language family, such as Aquitanian (which has been extinct since the early Middle Ages). The \u201cVasconic substrate\u201d hypothesis, put forward regarding the Germanic and Celtic languages, by linguists like Theo Vennemann, is controversial. It is true that unidentified languages contributed significantly to Proto-Germanic and Proto-Celtic \u2013 the evidence is words that have no resemblance to the equivalents in other Indo-European languages. A few examples follow. The Germanic languages have borrowed a lot of words relating to water and boats from a language now unknown. (Which would be consistent with the accepted idea that the ancestors of people who spoke Proto-Germanic were landlubbers from Central Europe.) Some resemble modern Basque words. For example, Many modern Germanic languages share similar words for \u201cice\u201d: eis, is, ijs, isar etc. The modern Basque word for \u201cice\u201d is izotz. (And the Germanic words are unlike [e.g.] the French glace and Polish l\u00f3d.)In Celtic languages, the case for a Vasconic substrate may be slightly stronger. For example, the Old Irish aindir/ainder \u201cyoung woman\u201d is virtually identical to the Basque word andere \u201cwoman\u201d.Elements of a number-naming system that is base-20 (or vigesimal), as opposed to base-10 (decimal) appear in several Western European languages \u2013 a feature that they share with Basque. For example, older forms of some Celtic languages (including Welsh, Breton and Scottish Gaelic) express 40 as \u201ctwo-twenties\u201d etc. In Old French deux-vingts (\u201ctwo-twenties\u201d) meant 40 and even now, numbers above 70 in standard French take an interesting form, e.g. soixante-dix-neuf (\u201csixty-nineteen\u201d). Modern Danish is even more peculiar, in that numbers above 50 are based on a kind of silent 20, e.g. 56 = seksoghalvtreds \u2013 literally \u201csix and half of the third (twenty)\u201d! Moreover, base-20 systems are rare in Indo-European languages (except, I think, for Albanian and some dialects of Slovenian).\u201cGrand\u201d in Romance languages (and English) is derived from the Latin (and before that Proto-Italic) However, the root grandi- \u201cbig\u201d may have been loaned from Proto-Vasconic, according to Vennemann. That is, \u201cbig\" in many other Indo-European languages is a word like mega, maha and (in Old English) mickle. Whereas modern Basque has handi \u201cbig\u201d. Vennemann suggests that this may have been *hrandi in Proto-Vasconic. (fwiw, This would also make a Vasconic language the ultimate source of my given name.)At the same time, scholars have tentatively proposed links between old, long-extinct languages elsewhere in southern Europe. It has long been suggested that Etruscan (Rasna; in northern Italy), Raetic (Switzerland), Lemnian and Minoan (both Greek Islands) may be part of a so-called Tyrrhenian language family. Etruscan and Raetic have long been supposed to be siblings. And in recent years evidence/research has also emerged connecting them to Lemnian. There is no evidence, as far as I know, that Vasconic and Tyrrhenian were related. However, Tyrrhenian has, more tentatively, been linked to the languages of the North-East Caucasian language family (modern examples of which include Chechen). Genetic samples from Mesolithic Europe appear to be show similar patterns from Iberia, Italy and the Balkans and northern Europe. Along similar lines, but less likely, are possible ties between Doggerish and, say, a North-East Caucasian, Kartvelian (e.g. Georgian) or Berber language. While I\u2019m sure that some ancestors of modern Europeans were part of the Azilian/Maglemosian cultures, it is clear that they have left few, if any, linguistic artefacts in modern languages \u2013 such as the members of the Germanic and Celtic languages now found in north-west Europe. There is also little evidence that those modern languages were in contact with each other, immediately before they arrived in the region. There is said to be a distant Indo-European substrate in the Finno-Ugric languages, and a more distant Uralic substrate in Indo-European, including Celtic and Germanic, but not significantly more than than other branches of Indo-European like Italic, Hellenic or Indo-Iranian. In other words the \u201cgreat-grandparent\u201d languages of modern Finnish and Celtic \u2013 namely proto-Uralic and proto-Indo-European \u2013 probably lived close by each other on the Eurasian steppe, before their descendant languages arrived in Europe proper, during the Bronze Age.
