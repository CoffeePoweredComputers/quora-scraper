            "answer_text": "Modern women are well educated and are well placed in organizations just like their male counterpart. However, the biggest challenge of modern women is to strike work-life balance; because the expectations of family members, especially the children and husband remained the same. Hence, while men are mentally free to concentrate on outer world the situation is still the same for women, as before. Hence, many times it is found that women are torn between the office requirement and family commitments. That\u2019s why even Indra Nooyee, the powerful CEO of Pepsico once initiated this debate and admitted that she had some regret that she could not give full attention to her children due to office load. The solution lies in the fact that the family members are to be more considerate & understanding and divide the household load equally so that modern days\u2019 women become stress-free and are able to plan their activities more effectively.
