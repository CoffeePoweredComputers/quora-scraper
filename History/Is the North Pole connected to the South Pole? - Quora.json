            "answer_text": "Yes. The space left behind by the antediluvian vortex that existed during the formation of the earth from the rotating nebulae cloud of gases and particles, is still in existence along the axis of rotation of the earth. This space connects the North Pole to South Pole. The true north pole and South Pole are suspended in space. The one marked on the surface of the earth, is actually on within the inner surface of the land that is bordering the space left behind by the antediluvian vortex. Marshall B. Gardener researched and published a book titled,\u201d A Journey to the center of the earth or have the poles really been discovered?\u201d, according to Marshall B. Gardener, One can neither discover true North Pole nor true South Pole on the surface of the earth as the are both suspended in space! According to Marshall B. Gardener, earth did not grow over millions of years as claimed by many using the theory of earth's formation by acretion. The nebulae cloud of gases and particles that formed earth was rotating from the beginning of earth's formation. It only evolved into a shell nebulae with a central star within the shell nebulae that illuminated the entire cloud of gases and particles. With time, the nebulae cloud of gases and particles started cooling and condensing. It later coalesced into an oblate spherical planetary shell with openings to the outside surface of the earth through the poles. According to Marshall B. Gardener, the central star within the shell nebulae was retained even after the planet was fully formed. This is the central sun within the Earth's interior which sustains life their. Here is the image of the earth as per Marshall B. Gardener.  Here is the image showing his rough estimate on the measurements. Which elements, if they were major within the landmass/firmament on interior side would give a shape like this? What about platinum family whose average density is 21.45g/cm^3? Don't talk of planet collapsing towards the interior because the interior region is directly exposed to space like the rest of the planet! Two, the centre of mass is located within the planetary shell and therefore, there is nothing major to redirect the gravitational force towards the geometric centre of the earth, the central star within the Earth's interior is not that massive! It is just enough to give heat and light!  Since this unknown interior region is connected to the outside surface of the earth at the poles, there exist some phenomenon and pieces of evidence at the North Pole that cannot be explained using our current understanding and model of solid earth theory. This is why he offered us hollow earth theory which he published in 1920 in a book titled,\u201d The Theory of the central sun within the Earth's interior or hollow earth theory\u201d. It is normal for some people to resist change and new knowledge and understanding when it comes. For people to reject and try to discredit Marshall B. Gardener's Theory, they must first explain the discrepancies that exist in ancient Cosmogony of the earth and our current Cosmogony of the earth. They should also explain why many ancient civilizations around the world believed that their ancestors came from the navel of the earth! Labelling Ancient history of human race as mythological and metaphorical cannot solve any problem. From Bibilical Genesis, it is very clear that before the deluge, there was a firmament/ landmass whenever one observed upwards from the ground. This firmament only disappeared after the flood! According to Marshall B. Gardener, Noah of Genesis was relocated by flood to the outside surface of the earth on which we live through the Northern polar opening! Almost every ancient civilization concur with Marshall B. Gardener's Theory. William Fairfield Warren traced the location of the Garden of Eden to the North Pole. His findings are published in a book titled,\u201dParadise found: The cradle of the human race at the North Pole\u201d. Back to the answer. North Pole is connected to the South Pole by space. If you are a die hard proponent of solid earth theory, then there is nothing I can do to change your mind. As per now, the density of the earth is just but a rough estimate. The interior surface crust may have more of platinum family of elements whose average density is 21.45g/cm^2. If this is the case, then the earth's average density may go up from 5.51g/cm^3 to a much higher value and the volume of the earth occupied by mass may come down drastically! Genesis is very clear, there was more gold on one of the rivers of Genesis, Gold recognized this. The density of gold is more than 19g/cm^3. If there is more gold within the crust layer on the inner surface world of the earth, then, this is likely to affect the overall density of the earth! Don't you agree? Let us be open to possibilities! Where there is smoke there is fire, the ancient people said! ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not totally sure what your question means. Of course the poles are connected. The poles are both on the surface of the Earth and that surface is continuous. You can't WALK all the way from North Pole to South Pole, because it's not land all the way. There is some water to cross. Even allowing for cold winters and a lot of ice between the North Pole and Canada, there is still quite a gap between Antarctica and South America. The poles are also connected through the body of the Earth, most directly along the Earth's rotational axis. ",
