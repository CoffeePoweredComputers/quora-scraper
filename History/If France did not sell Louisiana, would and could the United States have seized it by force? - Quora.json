            "answer_text": "There was never going to be a situation where any other country in North America would have been able to hold back the tide of American expansion. France sold Louisiana out of their own interest, in the words of Napoleon \u201cThis accession of territory strengthens forever the power of the United States, and I have just given to England a maritime rival that will sooner or later humble her pride\u201d. The United States defeated the British Empire in in the 1770s gaining our original territory, fought Britain to a stalemate in the early 1810s, and in the words of British Admiral Sir David Milne in 1817 \u201cWe cannot keep Canada if the Americans declare war against us again\u201d. The United States was on the ascendancy, growing rapidly in population, wealth, and military power. In 1810, West Florida declared independence from Spain and was immediately invaded and annexed by America despite Spanish and local objections. Eastern Florida, which had been a base for freed slaves and hostile Seminole tribe was simply seized from Spain in fact in 1818, and later recognized by the Spanish in exchange for various concessions. Mexican Texas was simply overthrown by American colonists who had moved into the territory and then proceeded to crush the Mexican army when they attempted to stop them. After just shy of 10 years as an independent republic, Texas joined the United States, Mexico attacked the United States (This was anticipated) and the United States seized all of the land between the United States and the Pacific Ocean from them. The point of this is that Louisiana was going to be part of the United States, even if France hadn\u2019t acted in their own interest by selling it to us. In fact, after the War of 1812 (When Britain did attempt to force America to accept an Indian buffer state in the Midwest as one of their war aims, but failed) it became increasingly impossible for anyone to prevent American expansion. In the words of Abraham Lincoln in his Lyceum address in 1838 \u201cShall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years\u201d. By the 1860s, when Civil War occurred in the United States, we were able to field and supply over 3,000,000 troops between the two combatants. No army from anywhere else on earth had any means to project armies of millions across the ocean to protect their territories from America, the costs and logistics were beyond what was capable in that century. America really had to be stopped right at the beginning if it was ever going to be stopped at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply put, western expansion of the young United States would have happened with or without the purchase. The English foothold on the continent was strong and viable. No other colonial power had the staying power of the English colonists. After the Revolutionary War, they were still moving in, looking for new lands, and saw this vast forest to the west that was rich, filled with game, could be cleared and farmed, and had everything needed to build a free life. Only two things were in the way. Wild animals and natives. You did take your life into your own hands to go there. But you would not be threatened by the French. They simply did not colonize like their British counterparts. Even Spain and Portugal were better at it, but their methods did not produce the same results, The closest may have been Mexico and California, but California was just a bit too far for the Spanish to control, and the Mexicans had become an ethnic mixture that was pretty much done with colonialism as well. It was the handwriting on the wall. If you lived there, you would thrive there. If you lived in Europe and wanted to rule it, good luck! The Russians could not maintain their claims, and they sold out. One by one the Spanish colonies rebelled and Brazil left Portugal. The remaining holdings were either small or too primitive to be much of a problem. So we to this day have some European islands in the Caribbean and the north part of South America, plus a spot in Central America. Even Canada with its ties to Britain is its own country. Basically Napoleon got what he could when he could and left town. It is not a shame to sell what you are going to lose anyway. People in the Americas sorted out their own destiny from that start. Sadly, not everything was morally right and good. The treatment of Native Americans, the use of African slave labor, slavery in Brazil, and many other exploitations went with the territory as well. Many of our problems today are really unpaid bills from past sins. Hopefully civilization is getting better, but I rather doubt the core of man has changed to the point where everybody is going to unselfishly do what is good for everyone. ",
