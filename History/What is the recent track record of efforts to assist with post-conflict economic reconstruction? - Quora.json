            "answer_text": "\"Rebuilding from War: Economic Reconstruction in Post-Conflict States,\" by Graciana del Castillo, published in World Politics Review June 1, 2011, provides a good start to answering to this question. Castillo is the author of \"Rebuilding War-Torn States: The Challenge of Post-Conflict Reconstruction.\" Her WPR article is excerpted below, and the full article is available at http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/9011/rebuilding-from-war-economic-reconstruction-in-post-conflict-states. The U.S.-led economic reconstruction projects in both Afghanistan and Haiti, as well as similar United Nations efforts in Africa, the Balkans and Timor Leste, highlight the dismal track record of post-Cold War efforts to help countries transition from war or other forms of chaos to peace. Despite a few success stories, roughly half of the countries facing such transitions, according to the U.N., relapsed into conflict or chaos, leading to further human tragedy, large number of refugees and internally displaced populations (IDPs), and huge costs in new military interventions and peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, failed states have become incubators for terrorism, trafficking of drugs and women, piracy and other illicit activities. As a result, failure at the country level has often had serious regional and global repercussions. Among those countries that did manage to keep a fragile peace, the large majority have ended up aid-dependent, hardly a sustainable situation either. Most of the countries that engaged in post-conflict reconstruction during the past two decades were emerging from civil war and other internal conflicts, although the crises often involved several countries in the region. Some of the countries facing reconstruction had emerged from the foregoing conflict as new states, as was the case with Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Timor Leste.  Countries emerging from civil war or armed independence movements confront the double challenge of creating dynamic economies and promoting inclusion, without which national reconciliation and the consolidation of peace will prove elusive. These countries face acute problems, however, and their policymaking options are restricted. While unproductive investment in these countries in the form of military and security expenditure is high, productive investment has been inadequate. After crises end, countries often have no income, no production and no savings. They therefore cannot invest, making them largely reliant on foreign aid, even for current expenditure. The provision of aid, however, is in disarray, and aid itself has in fact proved to be more of a problem than a solution. The challenge for many war-torn countries and for international donors is to redesign aid packages to focus primarily on the provision of reconstruction aid that promotes investment and local employment. While humanitarian aid to save lives in the short run should not be neglected, such aid promotes consumption rather than investment, creates price distortions and work disincentives, and fails to build local capacity. For these reasons, countries must be weaned off of humanitarian aid as soon as the situation allows it.  Reconstruction aid targeted toward improving infrastructure, reactivating services, agriculture and mining, and promoting small enterprises as well as startup companies should begin right away and should be the main focus of international aid commitments. There is no question that countries coming out of conflict or chaos at low levels of development need such aid to support them in the provision of basic functions, at least until they have access to private capital flows, including foreign direct investment and foreign borrowing.
