There is not one person in France who is \u201cethnic French\u201d, because this does not exist. We all have ancestors from somewhere else. The place now called France is on a massive migration route between the Mediterranean and North Europe. It has been so since the Neandertal first step foot on this continent. Please stop trying to manipulate us like you manipulated the US population. ",

            "answer_text": "I think this question sounds\u2026 a little bit biased. Like everywhere in the Western world, including America, people coming from other countries go there where they hope to find work. In Spain, for instance, you\u2019ll find women employed to gather strawberries under a scorching sun. They come from Marocco, Romania\u2026 In France, some immigrants are generally doing some unqualified work ethnic French people despise, unless they are physicians from Romania and other East European countries. This is called \u201cbrain drain\u201d. A lot of other persons coming in \u201crich\u201d countries from the poorest areas of the planet just gather in cities. They are not to be blamed for not being \u201cethnic French\u201d. To answer you from my own experience, I live in France, but I do not know such places you are looking for. They must be where tourists do not go, and are not necessarily the ones you\u2019d like. People hating foreigners are to be found everywhere. Sadly. ",
