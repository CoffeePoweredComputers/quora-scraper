            "answer_text": "Joseph Stalin had an extremely high level of intelligence. Sadly, he is the most demonized figure in world history. It is virtually impossible to separate the Nazi and American propaganda from reality. Further, his successor, Khrushchev, created a number of lies for political purposes to consolidate his own power. These were announced during his \u201cSecret Speech.\u201d Professor Grover Furr investigated the claims made by him against Stalin and had enough material to fill a book. https://mltheory.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/khrushchev-lied.pdf Lies Concerning the History of the Soviet Union  \u201cStalin was an avid reader, and while at seminary would read Goethe, Shakespeare, and Walt Whitman. At school, he began writing poetry of his own. Five of his poems, all written in Georgian, appeared in the popular literary journal, Iveria, which was owned by poet Ilia Chavchavadze.\u201d He wrote extensively about Marxism. He remained a dedicated Marxist his entire life. He even carried a bust of Lenin with him when he went on trips for inspiration. It was his idea to have Lenin embalmed, and the workers supported it so Stalin ordered it done. He also had a photographic memory. A collection of his works. He loved books and had a personal library of over 25,000 books. Stalin\u2019s work style was to listen to his generals. Zhukov and Rokossovsky were the two main military commanders. Rokossovsky during WWII was instrumental in helping the Soviets beat the Germans. Once he even defied Stalin. Stalin ordered him repeatedly to break through the German lines one, but Rokossovsky insisted on a different strategy. Stalin walked up to him and put his hand on his shoulder. The room was utterly silent. Nobody spoke that way to Stalin. Everyone thought Stalin was going to tear strip him of command. Stalin smiled, patted him on the shoulder, and said \u201cYou must really believe you are making the right decision, Comrade,\u201d and agreed to the change in plans. Rokossovsky proved to be correct. Stalin lived the life of an ascetic. He was very humble. He also admitted when he was wrong. Rokossovsky respected Stalin. Stalin even apologized to him for his imprisonment. \u201cIt happened during one of dinners in the Stalin residence in Kuncewo. The whole elite of the Soviet Union was invited, including most important activists of the communist party and the highest ranking officers of the Red Army. Stalin in his snow-white uniform stood up and walked slowly to Rokossovsky\u2019s chair. \u201cWere you beaten down there?\u201d \u201cYes\u2026\u201d Stalin turned around in silence, walked outside to his garden and came back with the bouquet of thorny roses. He didn't cut them by scissors, he used his own hands. They were completely bloodied. He gave the roses to Rokossovsky with those bloodied hands: \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Stalin faced enormous opposition. He saw the writing on the wall and announced in 1931:  Trotsky was working with Germany and Japan to overthrow the government. Further, there were massive numbers of former members of the White Army that had infiltrated the Party and were trying to provide as much opposition as possible. After the Russian Civil War the enemies didn\u2019t evaporate. There was an undercover sting operation by the intelligence services in which a pretend anti-Bolshevik organization was formed. It was called Operation Trust. Several volumes of names were gathered. Kenneth Neil Cameron in his short biography on Stalin: \"[Stalin's role in the war] was recognized by the Soviet people, and by the end of the war he was regarded as the savior of the nation. The record shows that the tribute was well deserved. Had Stalin not won the fight for industrialization and defeated the Trotskyists and Bukharinites, the USSR would have become a Nazi province. Had he not had the foresight to build a metallurgical industry in the Urals, the Red Armies could not have been supplied with arms. Had he not industrialized the economy and introduced mechanized farming, he would have had neither a base for producing arms nor a mass of soldiers trained in the operation of machinery. Had he not signed a nonaggression treaty with Germany, the USSR might have been attacked 22 months sooner. Had he not moved the Soviet armies into Poland, the German attack would have begun even closer to Moscow. Had he not subdued General Mannerheim's Finland, Leningrad would have fallen. Had he not ordered the transfer of 1,400 factories from the west to the east, the most massive movement of its kind in history, Russian industry would have received a possibly fatal blow. Had he not built up the army and equipped it with modern arms, it would have been destroyed on the frontiers. He did not, of course, do these things alone. They were Party decisions and Party actions, and behind the Party throughout was the power, courage, and intelligence of the working class. But Stalin stood at all times as the central, individual directing force, his magnificent courage and calm foresight inspiring the whole nation.\" From Stalin: Man of Contradiction, pg. 107 (1987) Administrative ability Stalin was promoted to the top of the Soviet Union due to his superior managerial abilities. He was also more practical than Trotsky, who wanted to continue worldwide revolution and who was more socially liberal. Stalin remembered detail, and was very cautious about dealing with matters.        ",

            "answer_text": "Quantifiable IQ measurements became known and adopted in the USSR decades after Stalin\u2019s death, so we don\u2019t know for sure. What we know is that he was enormously successful in his role as Soviet ruler. Successful people, especially those who can survive and triumph in the universe of Communist politics, are likely to be very intelligent. Before he became the top dog, no one among his Bolshevik comrades considered him the brightest bulb in the bunch. He was seen as a diligent, but pigheaded and vindictive workhorse, born for back-office paper-shuffling, and not much else. During the Civil War, the Party sent him to command the Red forces in the Volga region, then in Poland and Caucasus. His achievements were middling. He also caused Lenin\u2019s wrath at his mismanagement of ethnic politics in the south. However, his brand recognition as an unsurpassed back-office workhorse secured to him the new post of General Secretary who was tasked with putting in order membership in the Party in 1922. This was Stalin\u2019s claim to fame. He used his enormous work capacity for creating the procedures and network at all levels of power in order to neutralize and eliminate all his competitors, one by one. After that was done, everyone suddenly discovered how brilliant and deep he was. Luminaries from East and West who made a pilgrimage to the Kremlin, and especially our allies during WW2, poured words of amazement at the man. Only solitary voices like Trotsky kept insisting that he was no more than an \u201cextraordinary mediocrity\u201d. As to Stalin\u2019s theoretical works, none of them are remarkable in any sense. He spoke slowly. His style is repetitive, relatively simple, brimful of trivialities and dumbed-down references to classics. It is debatable how much of this can be attributed to his inadequate mastery of Russian (not his native language), or to a deliberate adaptation to the level of his audience and party comrades. A few poems he wrote, are run-of-the-mill and will hardly ever make it into poetic anthologies of the 20th century. However, from people who knew Stalin, we can infer that Stalin scored extremely high on work capacity, curiosity, power of observation and ego. In retrospective, we also can also see his outstanding strategic vision. How much this came from his almost photographic memory and extraordinary single-mindedness, or from his IQ, is impossible to say. Below, one of Stalin\u2019s portraits made during his rule. As you can see, he was not only sharp and very successful, but also had an acute sense of style, an athlete\u2019s physique and was at least 6\u20323 tall.  ",

            "answer_text": " I am reading now the most fascinating book I have read in the last couple of years. The book titled \u201cStalin and Mongolia\u201d is a compilation of orders, reports and minutes of the meetings where Stalin participated or made decisions in relation to Mongolia. Most of them had a \u201cTop Secret\u201d rating. They were official documents that were never meant to be viewed by the public and especially Mongolian Government. Therefore, they offer an unprecedented, though limited view, of the thinking of the Soviet leadership about Mongolia. Kudos to this collaboration of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, Mongolian General Authority on Archives and the Russian Archival authorities. 1930s was a very difficult period in Mongolian history. Mongolia declared itself independent in 1911, Socialist in 1921. In the 1930s Mongolia itself was experiencing some of the same purges, collectivization and jailing of the monks/lamas as in the Soviet Union. What really surprised me about this book was the level of knowledge about Mongolia by Stalin. Stalin\u2019s signatures were in various documents starting from increase of trade, to building the railroads, to arrests of Mongolian officials deemed unreliable. Soviet Union must have been experiencing some of the bigger external and internal issues at that time. Why was Stalin so involved with Mongolia? Reading from the reports you can get some idea that Japan, uniting the whole of China and Mongolia, must have been the biggest geo-strategic move that Stalin was really worried about. It would have opened the whole of Soviet Union\u2019s south eastern border. Stalin\u2019s thinking about Mongolia: He helped prepare Mongolia to the eventual armed conflict with Japan. This was done starting from early 1930s, 7\u20138 years before the war. Some of his words from the meeting minutes with Mongolian Prime Minister Genden: First, you need to make your country strong. Currently it is not clear which is stronger, the lamas or the state. How would other countries accept you if you are weak? You need to make a strong army, improve the economic and social well being of the population. After that you can declare yourself independent from China. Then the imperialist countries such as Japan and UK would recognize you. If you are strong you don\u2019t have to be scared of them, even if they don\u2019t recognize you. Important thing is you need to be strong. Some of his recommendations: Increase the budget for military from 1/4 of the total government budget to 50 percent. Increase the number of divisions from one to four. Effectively increase the army from 12,000 to 57,000. This number does not include Internal and border troops. Stalin and the masses: Stalin understood that the goodwill of the people was very important. He didn't have any qualms about arresting Mongolian leadership, but he was careful about not antagonizing the people. In 1932, there was a serious rebellion by a 1000 strong Mongolian military unit. This was in response to collectivization that was occurring all over Mongolia. Soviet representative, sent a secret telegram to Stalin asking to send the closest Soviet unit from Buryad republic. Stalin's response was interesting, he declined this request as he didn't want the general population think of the Soviets as an occupying force. This was Mongolia\u2019s problem, let them solve it. But in the meantime, he ordered all the \u201cTop Secret\u201d documents evacuated from Mongolia. Stalin and Army: Army is the only school that you need to complete. The army is the protector of your motherland, it brings culture to its people, the army is implementer of the Party\u2019s ideology. Army is also a valuable place for human resources. Stalin the scrooge: when he heard that Mongolian government lets people use the water wells for free, without paying for water, he recommended charging money, and more for the monks. Stalin and budget: In order to increase Mongolia\u2019s budget he recommended to create monopoly on tobacco, salt, matches, and alcohol. Stalin and religion: Stalin thought that the biggest enemy of the Mongolian people were the lamas. They had unprecedented authority on Mongolian people and therefore needed to be exterminated. He thought they could lead people to support Japan instead of Soviet Union. Some of his words to Mongolian leadership: It\u2019s like a state (religion) within a state. If Chinggis khan was alive, he would have never accepted this. He would have exterminated them. Remember what we did with the Orthodox priests? I recommend you do the same with the lamas. Stalin and his paranoid nature. Russian Foreign Minister Molotov brought these accusations against Mongolian Prime Minister Genden during the meeting with Stalin. When you are drunk you always talk anti-Soviet rhetoric.During the border meetings with Manchukuo and Japanese representatives you have been heard saying that this conflict was not between Mongolia and Manchukuo, but between Japan and Soviet Union.We know that before arriving to this meeting you said that you would probably be offered to be \u201chospitalised\u201d for a long time in Crimea.In the end, Prime Minister Genden was \u201chospitalised\u201d and his health drastically worsened and he eventually died from complications. Without a doubt, Stalin was a monster. But he was a highly intelligent monster. His methods were straightforward and effective. He had more knowledge and intelligence than the participants he was meeting. Often he and his assistants had more information, compared to Mongolian government officials he was meeting.

            "answer_text": "How intelligent was Joseph Stalin? As in IQ..? IQ? What IQ? Which IQ? IQ is an instrument based on statistics. One man is not statistics. Especially not stats if the man is one-of-a-kind person. Stalin (Soso) was 13 when Lado Ketskhoveli took him to a little bookshop in Gori, where he paid a five kopeck subscription and borrowed a book the Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species. Stalin read it all night. As his reading intensified, his piety wavered. One day Soso and some friends, including Grisha Glurjidze, lay on the grass in town talking about the injustice of there being rich and poor when he amazed all of them by suddenly saying: \u201cGod\u2019s not unjust, he doesn\u2019t actually exist. We\u2019ve been deceived. If God existed, he\u2019d have made the world more just.\u201d \u201cSoso! How can you say such things?\u201d exclaimed Grisha. \u201cI\u2019ll lend you a book and you\u2019ll see.\u201d He presented Glurjidze with a copy of Darwin. At the age of 16, Soso took his poems to the offices of the famous newspaper Iveria (Georgia), where he was received by the country\u2019s greatest poet, Prince Ilya Chavchavadze, a romantic nationalist who believed in an agrarian Georgia ruled by an enlightened aristocracy. The Prince was sufficiently impressed to show the teenager\u2019s work to his editors. He admired Stalin\u2019s verse, choosing five poems to publish\u2014quite an achievement. Prince Chavchavadze called Stalin the \u201cyoung man with the burning eyes.\u201d He was admired in Georgia as a poet before he was known as a revolutionary. Stalin earned more pocket-money (five roubles, he recalled later) by singing in the choir. He was \u201cthe first tenor of the right wing of the choir\u201d\u2014the key choirboy\u2014and often performed in the Opera House. He was 29 when he masterminded the famous bank robbery in Tiflis. Everyone who writes his biography will be sure to mention this fact. Not just to mention but will give a full and lengthy description of the action. In most cases, though they will not mention that not a broken copper copeck Soso will take for himself. All will go to Lenin for the Revolution. Remember the Jack London\u2019s The Mexican? Well, in the scale of Stalin\u2019s huge figure all the above is small change, the prelude, the fairytale is still ahead. Like building the Empire, running it thru the terrible times of the WWII, recovering it from the destruction\u2026 etc. But for any ordinary human \u2013how many you know personally who could yet in his boyhood to digest the Origin of Species and make a practical lesson for himself? Like Louis XIV, Stalin had the right to exclaim \u2013 Soviet Union is me. His phenomenal memory and tireless working ability allowed him to keep in mind the whole dynamics of the events going on from the West to the Far East. But that's not all. You can tell that he really saved his empire when he demonstrated true statesmanship, impressing and making friends with Roosevelt. More than that. He secured the place of Russia on the world stage for eternity, when ordered to urgently develop the Soviet atomic bomb.And yet, not exactly like Louis XIV. Much, much more sophisticated. Most public men share the Caesarian habit of detaching themselves to admire their own figures on the world stage, but Stalin\u2019s detachment was a degree greater. His adopted son Artyom Sergeev remembers Stalin shouting at his son Vasily for exploiting his father\u2019s name. \u201cBut I\u2019m a Stalin too,\u201d said Vasily. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d replied Stalin. \u201cYou\u2019re not Stalin and I\u2019m not Stalin. Stalin IS Soviet power. Stalin is what he is in the newspapers and the portraits, not you, no not even me!\u201d Compiled on the basis of the following books:     ",

            "answer_text": "Of all the negatives you can state about Joseph Stalin, one can not truthfully say he was not intelligent. He outmaneuvered some of the shrewdist, evilest, and most vile set of people produced out of late 19th Century Russia and the early 20th Century Soviet Union had produced. The fact that he and his cronies were even more vile  does not detract from that at all. Examples: 1.Out maneuvering and eventually destroying Leon Trotsky, a tactical mastermind, an intellectual, and murderous thug bar none. Who might have been Stalin's equal in murder and cruelty if he had survived. But certainly he did plenty of killing with what power he had.; 2. Out maneuvering and destroying lesser lights such as Kamenev, Zinoviev, Bukharin...etc... 3. Bringing down and destroying the brilliant and talented hero Mikhail Tukhachevsky. Stalin read quite prodigiously and understood quite difficult and thorny political works and was able to discuss, criticise, and even improve upon the same. And he appreciated fine performances of dramas and comedies and grumbled about his own inability to have a fine performance without having to use bureaucratic functionaries to curtail the incidental or deliberate counter soviet messages by writers and directors. He turned a backward and agrarian failing country into a world super power. Yes he can criticised because there were better ways to do it, but he was the backbone of the successful way it was done. And this was all done by a peasant who was recognized as very promising student and who had to cut his own studies short because he was involved in the first stages of a revolution.

How smart was that?\u201d One anecdote picked up by a researcher canvassing for witnesses in his home village impresses me. After daddy dearest was run out of town and his mother was going door to door taking in washing and looking for any work going, one client said \u201cI have a new book I think Soso would like to read.\u201d Soso started it over supper and when she got up the next morning, he was still up, just finishing it. He was pre-teen. The book was The Origin of Species. He had the brain. Too bad she didn\u2019t send him to the Jesuits. It was never trained and that shows. Let us never forget Lysenko. But\u2014 In 1931, Stalin said \u201cWe are 50 to 100 years behind and have 10 years to make it up.\u201d Who else in history has had a clearer grasp of his times and where they were leading? And\u2014 From the time he was very small, Stalin was brutalized to the point of maiming by his father, a mean drunk who drank daily. At times he and his mother went running through the night seeking refuge with a neighbour as the stumbling footsteps neared the door. Before the age of reason, below the layers of reasoned knowledge he learned this: \u201cNo matter how close they are, no matter if they smile and sing, they are out to get you.\u201d It didn\u2019t help that after his father was gone, his mother used to hit him with a stick, although probably not to a life-threatening degree. And then there was Lenin, the father he never had (as opposed to the father he did have), who decided to sacrifice him to the secret police to maintain the cover of another member of the movement. \u201cNo matter how close they are, they will betray you.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I will primarily use the power struggle between 1924\u20131929. Stalin started out as the \u201cgrey blur\u201d and \u201ccomrade card-index\u201d, someone focused on purely administrative work and visibly had no power. However, his position as general secretary gave him the power to admit his supporters into the party and analyze people\u2019s information to control them. This likely proved useful to him later on. It gave him more power than his opponents thought. The first (major) decision he made during the struggle was siding against Trotsky. Trotsky was a figure who divided people. On one hand, people thought of him as Lenin\u2019s natural successor. On the other hand, people didn\u2019t like him for being Jewish, having overly liberal views, and thought of him as slightly crazy. The four other contenders semi-forced Trotsky out. He left the party soon after. Stalin picked Bukharin as his next ally. Bukharin had control of media, moderate right wing policies, and was fairly liked, albeit very young and inexperienced, which made Stalin look a lot better. Stalin also, very wisely, shut his mouth and kept quiet about his opinions during this period. This meant that he created less enemies and was always in the majority. His moderate policy meant that he was generally liked by more people. Perhaps also a good decision because of how inexperienced Bukharin was. When it came to the two of them, it seemed that Stalin could easily defeat Bukharin. We can also factor in the mistakes of his opponents. The Trotsky haters suddenly became Trotsky supporters. Pretty weird (in my opinion) and the radical policy was not at all popular. They also got booed out of Congress and kicked out of the Party. They also made a mistake earlier on opposing Trotsky as Kamenev and Zinoviev actually had radically left policies. In 1929 the opinion of the party shifted with the failures of the NEP and the creation of more inequality through the reintroduction of capitalist elements within the Soviet Union. Stalin personally ordered the seizure of grain and openly supported far-left policies for collectivisation, industrialization and increased economic development. He now had a personality and seemed the strong leader that people were looking for. Bukharin did not have that advantage. Looking at the power struggle, I would say that Stalin\u2019s intelligence lies in his sensitivity to others\u2019 true thoughts and feelings as well as extreme awareness. This worked against him later on as he was paranoid as the leader of Russia and instigated multiple purges, installed forced labor camps, and constantly executed people close to him. I would say that in part, his intelligence was also his undoing. He had an uncanny ability for hiding himself in the right way and strategically revealing himself when it worked in his favor. Look at how he poses in peasant clothing, medals, cementation of his work centered personality, and then finally displaying the strength that people desired at the time. He\u2019s intelligent - scarily so. Maybe not in some aspects - he has made numerous mistakes in his reign - but his strategic decisions when it came to power are proof that he is indeed very, very smart. Combined with his thirst for power, it gets scary. ",

In fact, he was very insecure and channeled that insecurity into brutal suppression of the opposition and the Reign of Terror. There's also evidence that Stalin had a degenerative brain condition that made him excessively paranoid, delusional, and ruthless.  Stalin was a man of contradictions. He was self-taught, with a strong discipline. At the end of his life, when he had to discuss with his staff the upcoming war in Korea and its timing, Stalin was working on a long article about linguistics. He was just an amateur-linguistician, which did not prevent him from publishing a long and boring article in the Pravda on June 20 with the title: Marxism and the problems of linguistics.  Stalin had a boundless conceitedness, he was a restless reader of 20,000 books on history and literature, he maintained that he read up to 500 pages a day. He had made up his name and date of birth himself, and was a paranoiac with many faces, an impenetrable sphinx, calculating but incalculable, obsessed by blackmailing, tortures and executions. Source - The Master and Margarita - Stalin's Personality  Stalin had a fierce temper, but \"had a long memory and exceptional patience\" (Uralov, p. 79). Stalin could wait for years, remember, and then seek harsh, merciless revenge on those who crossed him: \"Lenin died before he could deal with Stalin, and Trotsky the friend of the Georgian Nationalists was no longer there to defend them from Stalin's wrath. Stalin waited ten years, then sent Beria who liquidated all the Georgian Bolsheviks whom he had formerly accused of nationalist tendencies\" (Uralov, p. 79).

Stalin was a despot - not an intellectual - whose interest in establishing power and dominance took precedence over reason. Many of those in the Communist Party whom he would later go on to persecute were likely much more intelligent them himself. Stalin hated intellectuals, as they were more likely to question his leadership and thus posed a perceived threat to him. Really this was a manifestation of his paranoia and his ego more than anything. His ruthlessness and willingness to eliminate anyone who stood in his way were ultimately what carried him to the top of Soviet politics and not his intellect. Totalitarian systems of the sort which Stalin presided over are immanently anti-intellectual; they discourage critical thinking in favor of blind obedience. ",

He solved problems by killing folks, which suggests an abysmal lack of imagination and thus low to normal intelligence. Contrast him with Elizabeth I, who impressively applied a number of highly sophisticated strategies to deal with the problems she faced.  She killed when she had to, but it was as a last resort. ",

Those are not accomplishments of stupid men. Especially when his main rivals were of revolutionary generation, accomplished schemers by their own right. ",
