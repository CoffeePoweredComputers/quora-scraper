            "answer_text": "You do not want to know too much completely, yet; The solar output before our star the Sun is already removed the last two ice fields from Canada. More heat is now coming and now Greenland ice fields are really under stress. The temperature of the Arctic Ocean is really going to become a problem. This is summer and the North will begin (a type of burning). We only have a short time until the Sun itself crosses over and heads for Australia. Remain out of direct sunlight as much as possible. Cancer particularly melanoma (which i s skin cancer) is the worst cancer of them all and with the higher output from the star our Sun then many more will find this cancer on their own bodies. You have enough now to remind you that covid19 is not the end of life. NOT YET ANYWAY. ",
