            "answer_text": "Strangely, this is the second time I have had a request to answer a question about mice in a bed\u2014the first time, I thought it was so unusual that it was truly a unique situation; now, I can\u2019t help but wonder what is going on?! Is it becoming a cultural norm to eat in bed? The reason I wonder that is because my experience with wild mice in a home is that they will go to where the food is. So growing up, that meant every once in awhile, we would get a mouse in the kitchen (or the basement, but that\u2019s how they got in). I did have one time where a mouse was seen in my bedroom, but again, it was due to a specific entry point: Mine and my sister\u2019s shared bedroom was situated over the garage. We had recently converted the house from the old radiator system to the new (at that time) floor-board heaters. Unfortunately, when the old radiator was taken out of the bedroom, that left a small, circular hole in the floor where the pipe used to be. Before we got it covered up, we noticed a mouse pop up through the hole, but it scurried back down into the garage as soon as it saw us noticing it. Then we securely covered the hole, no more problem. I suspect that if the mouse had gone undetected, it would have made its way to the kitchen and would not have stayed long in the bedroom. The point is, if you are finding mice in your bedroom at all, it would be because there is an entry point from the outside that they are accessing to get in, and if there is food in the bedroom, that is what they will be drawn to. Unless you have a habit of eating in bed or keeping food next to it, it is doubtful that mice will climb into your bed when you are sleeping. If you have been eating there and have observed mice in the room: remove all food from your bedroom (wash your bedding and vacuum, crumbs are still food to a mouse), and try to find how the mice are getting in so that you can seal off the holes.

If you have a mouse in your room, then it\u2019s very possible it will crawl in your bed. However, they don\u2019t do it out of sheer malice. Usually, they\u2019re just trying to traverse the distance between their nest and their food source. There\u2019s two things you can do: Make your room inhospitable for mice. Keep it clean. Avoid clutter. Don\u2019t bring food in and the mice will have earthly business there.Get the ultimate bedroom mouse guard. ",

I had a friend in high school who lived on a dairy farm and sometimes they would take food to bed with them, this may have been the reason, but the rat or mouse, they said it was a rat but it bit the guy on the cheek of the face 2 times closely together. He had to have shots and did not look too great for a couple of weeks. It was a nasty bite and the only one I have ever seen in my life, but proves it can happen. The best thing is to keep them out of your house and mint is a good thing to use because both of them, rats and mice do not like the smell. You can also keep a cat around! ",

We moved into a old house and my mom was a clean freak. When she seen a rat . She could buy traps fast enough. LOL We lived in a spotless house. But a good cat will keep them out. The mice can smell cat. After all that , my son owns a snake , 8 foot boa. We bought rats to feed him . Dead / frozen. We thought it would be easier to get a live male and female rat, and feed them to the snake. Now we have 5 pet rats, that don\u2019t know their rats and from a batch of 12 we gave the rats away as pets.made 12 children happy. And when I think of the 5 rats that are now pets. I think of my mom. Now passed. How she would have never ever let snake or rats in her house. LOL. She would have killed me .. lol  ",

That said, (because not all people have a barn cat nearby) try going to a Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s - they have sales people who can give you a lot of help. Go online to check into product ratings of each product, so you can get the best-working product that is as cruelty-free as possible. It is nearly impossible to kill all the mice in your house, so if you have the option, talk to a pest control person in your area. They will try to catch the mice and return them to an area where they are not going to get into people\u2019s homes. ",
