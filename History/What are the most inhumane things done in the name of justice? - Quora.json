            "answer_text": "The Starving 'Witch' Boy Eight weeks ago, a child called Hope was living on the streets of Nigeria. He was starving, riddled with worms and many people in the local community had accused him of being a 'witch.' A photo of Hope, being given a sip of water by Danish philanthropist Anja Ringgren Lov\u00e9n, went viral after she uploaded it in January 2016.  Soon after the photo was taken, Anja took Hope for treatment at the charity she set up in Nigeria with her husband, the African Children's Aid Education and Development Foundation (ACAEDF). He's clearly on the road to recovery.  The little boy's story has now sparked an awareness campaign, led by ACAEDF, regarding superstitions held in parts of rural Nigeria about children being witches. The campaign also plans to spread awareness about the plight of child soldiers and starvation.   The Starving 'Witch' Boy Is On The Road To Recovery   ",
