However, there are plenty of Romanians I met in the US who happened to be nice people. One was a former classmate (who married an Indian man in the US, who treats her like a queen) who was really nice. Another was a not so smart (but very in need of a friend) woman who married a much older (half- Romanian, half - Italian) man who was cheating on her husband, and every time she went out with one of her other men, told her hubby that she was with me. Needless to say, her hubby thought I was a lesbian at the time and wanted to take her from him. The third one was a psychologist in Romania\u2026 very nice woman, but a babysitter/ nanny in the US. The fourth one was a former manager of mine\u2026 as soon as I found out she was Romanian, I blurted out EVERYTHING I could think of in Romanian (the neutral, the rude, the ugly\u2026 all ending with the Romanian translation of \u201cI pooped on myself!\u201d). I am not great with people, but each time I messed up, she defended me. In the US, most of the times a Hungarian meets another, they will either ignore you or think, \u201cHow can I use this idiot to benefit me?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I am coming from a mixed Romanian Hungarian background but acquired a Canadian perspective over my decades of living abroad. I still have family, friends back and a host of memories to be able to share my perspective on the matter During the long duration of cohabitation between the two people, the interrelationships shifted dramatically over time. It seems to me that in the newer generations ignoring each other would be a better description of their feelings. A few generations prior of them the sentiment of hatred was fuel by the conscious efforts to build national states and a national mythology based on history presented in heroic and rosy terms. But if one looks at the historical events, say at the times of King Matthias and before that, people of the two ethnicity were quote friendly so the shift must have been ignited by actions coming after. I cannot pinpoint an exact cause, just maybe to associate the hatred to the shift in approach in the Hungarian Kingdom that also caused the Peasant Rebellion of Gy\u00f6rgy Dozsa in 1512, and later the spread of the Tripartitum - Wikipedia (a set of laws meant to quell the rights of the peasants in Transylvania) It is still good that both Hungarians and Romanians took a moderate stands and things moved on quite peacefully in contemporary times though (compared that to Bosnia or Kosovo). But the animosity transpire to this day in the debates regarding historical events, and I am not happy with that ",
