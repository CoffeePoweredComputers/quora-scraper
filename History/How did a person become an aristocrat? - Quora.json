            "answer_text": "A group of people found land. Created a village around it. More people came and agreed to live in the land if the more established people shared resources, and promised not to kill them in exchange for cooperation and some control over their own resources in return. Years pass, and the people in charge innately had more power to pass on to the next generation due to the contract signed by the peasants. The peasants were also employed by the more established as security, night guards, etc. which meant a social order that allowed for relative peace. People in charge continued to produce children, and more peasants came to the village due to it\u2019s economic power/geographic location which translated to not dying in the wilderness from animal attacks, or being raped/killed by strangers walking the plains. Soon, the village grew to include a castle, which protected the peasants from animals and rapist/serial killers/other villages who wanted their resources for themselves. The village with the castle grew into a city, complete with great walls, a sewer system, relatively comfortable shelter in the form of houses and tall buildings, and a group of guards that were now a part of an army that kept the city safe. At this point, life was pretty good. The peasants weren\u2019t being murdered or killed by animals, and a complete social structure had been established to preserve this level of comfort. The great great great great great grandchildren of the founders of the village were also very comfortable because they were in charge of everything that was going on. As they also controlled the laws and the people who enforced them (peasants who needed jobs to feed their families) as well as the armies that kept other cities from ransacking the city, the people in charge enjoyed more privileges, wealth, and an overall higher quality of life than the normal peasants that lived within the city.  I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s 3:30am, and I can\u2019t sleep. I figured writing this would knock me out. It\u2019s working.  Anyway, so the people in charge used their resources to make sure that the people in the city didn\u2019t get to out of hand, which allowed them to live like how the Tudors did in that one show about them. With control over the people, the police, the laws, and the armies, the people in charge effectively became aristocrats of that particular city/nation/land. Good night! ",

            "answer_text": "Patronage by the reigning monarch was the major route. The king/queen would make someone a knight and give them land.The position was inheritable by their children and so off you go with an aristocratic dynasty. An aristocrat is basically someone with a major title such as duke, earl, lord or sir or someone who will become one or is married to such a person. Governments can now confer these titles but it doesn\u2019t make the recipient an aristocrat. Nowadays it\u2019s about having had the title in their family for many years. Many European countries had the same system as Britain but social revolutions have brought them down. There were a lot of penniless French aristocracy, for example. It implies a very rich, high borne, ruling class but that is not so now. In Britain, aristocrats drop their titles if in government because of the bad connotations of robber barons and being out of touch with ordinary people. It is still in evidence for example the Duke of Westminster owns a lot of London. ",
