            "answer_text": "Simple: Colonization. Essentially, from the Middle Ages until WWII, every major European nation had decided they wanted a piece of Africa and held a claim on some of its territory. Most of the north and north-west chunk of Africa was \u201ccolonized\u201d by the French. The British also had large \u2018claims\u2019, but more to the east as well as the central-south. Depending on where you are in Africa, English, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch may seem like the predominant \u2018European\u2019 language for that area; proportionally, I\u2019m not certain that French is the dominant European language throughout Africa, though it may seem like the one most widely used. Same is true with portions of Asia; the French had colonized the far east and formed Indochina, which they lost after the Battle of Dien Bien Phu (1954), hence why French is still common in Viet Nam, Laos, and Cambodia.
