            "answer_text": "Well, Firstly, Tibet doesn\u2019t belong to him. And I dare say Tibet don\u2019t need him either, certainly not China. May I opine that when given the chance by Mao, he didn\u2019t provide the right leadership nor courage for the good of his people when he had the chance IMHO.  In spite of the tense circumstances, should history be kind with leaders that made the most foolish of choices and then ran away so easily. When empires fell, how many kings or emperors elope? Did he not leave behind a shitty theocratic Tibet full of parasitic monks, slaves, serfs, debts and bondage and strange archaic practices.  The History of Tibet - what happened? If you are serious about knowing Tibet problems, then watch this critically > https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sko0oEKoHk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sko0oEKoHk) \u2013 A good detail documentary video of its history and why the events happened.  Old Tibet - a harsh land, where millions slaved to support a huge theocracy and landed aristocrats. Shangri La it was not, and not a great place to live for the majority.  When some idiots mention \u2018cultural genocide\u2019 I really want to puke. Well, the Dalai Lama can at least be happy that Tibet is more developed, richer and kinder now then before. Serfdom or slavery common in the Himalayas is now banned, and no one ever loses his arm, or eye or starved for his skin any more. THE GUARDIAN: What We Don\u2019t Hear About Tibet  New Tibet - All 74 poverty-stricken areas of Tibet has been lifted out of poverty. Yes, Tibet has developed with huge improvements. Given its geography, how many inside Tibet really think independence useful?  Dalai Lama knowing the change has said, \u201cTibet does not want independence from China\u201d. Dalai Lama: Tibet wants to stay with China, says Dalai Lama | India News - Times of India OK, you heard it. Isn\u2019t that what he said? Well, The reality is that the world has accepted Tibet is part of China and looking at what we can see, most Tibetans see themselves as part of China today and lives are good enough. At least for the ex-serfs or their descendants who can expect a brighter future.  Go visit Tibet if you really care. You will see that China has taken care of it rather well.  Tibet is so fascinating and beautiful.  Tourism means GDP. Awe-inspiring alpine scenery, fervent pilgrimage and sacred monasteries and temples, and countless legends and mysteries, etc.  After 1959, (China) abolished slavery, serfdom and unfair taxes. Creating jobs through new infrastructure projects and development, first hospitals, schools in every major village, universities, and bringing free education (12 years). Clean water was pumped into the main towns and villages and the average life expectancy has almost doubled since 1950, to 60. (the Guardian)  In short, better than the natives in other places which shall not mention here. The Future of Tibet  And the liberated women do look quite fine, don\u2019t you think?  The Question should be - whether he wants to return to Tibet? So what can the Lama do for Tibet? There are enough of Lamas in Tibet. And religion is vibrant enough, except some bizarre bits banned of course.  Still magnificent with countless monastries.  Plenty of local culture and age old customs just like the other 55 minority ethnics.  A few seemingly bizarre, esoteric and out of place or time.  Some beautiful, graceful and refined.  So what part of \u2018culture\u2019 does the Lama want to \u2018help\u2019 preserve?? His golden throne or his medieval theocracy or the sadistic judicial system? Maybe he should help India and protect the archaic caste system.  What \u2018RETURN\u2019? I dont think the Dalai Lama will return nor can he even if he wants to. I don\u2019t think China needs him or want much to do with him any more. I certainly don\u2019t.  Maybe we all prefer he stay forever in India, enjoy his PR stunts and politics, entertain his celebrity fans, spew his \u2018common sense\u2019 enlightenment and just slowly fade away.  Wonder if he is still plotting his reincarnation to be in India, being a sly politician even about spiritual reincarnation. Would he yet make another wrong choice as back in the Spring of 1959 and topsy turvy the peace that his own Buddha had sacrificed so much to grace the human race? India and CIA are queer bedfellows in the perpetual love and support of the Dalai Lama, but why would they need too, when he possesses one personal protector, the fearsome Palden Lhamo. Did you know?  I bet the media don\u2019t usually write about the old demons nor the parasitic theocracy or the slavery nor the gouging out of eyes nor the drums and religious artefacts made of human parts and skin, did they? So what part of culture does he really want to preserve?  A good summary of what Tibet is all about, and for a critical read, with an open mind. http://www.bannedthought.net/China/Magazines/ChinaReconstructs/1976/CR1976-03.pdf ",

Today peaceful Tibetans self-immolate (burn themselves to death) rather than live under its oppressive rule. In droves. Imagine how bad life would have to be for Tibetans to do so. But China has raped the country and made a lucrative fortune out of their ignominous appropriation of defenseless Tibet Some notes dispelling myths circulated about nasty slave state old Tibet :There is a picture of a man in chains. He was a notorious highway man who had just finally been captured. At the same time, some Western photographer happened to be around. He was proudly displayed, as he had been a wanted bandit for a long time Human remains were not commonly used in Tiber. Occasionally some student might incorporate parts of his venerated deceased teacher to create a personal ritual object (like a drum or thighbone horn). This was not common to say the least. However, the harvesting of human organs from innocent prisoners in prison camps is very common in modern China. Good money in the international trade There were no slaves in Tibet. No one who ever lived there \u2014 Westerners and so forth \u2014 for hundreds of years ever saw or heard of such a thing. Nor was it ever believed in China for hundreds of years prior to this pronouncement of the current CCP. This is mere self-serving propaganda. And in another irony, China runs numerous prison camps working Tibetans to death as slaves to make cheap products for export A country oppressed. Its protestors preferring self-immolation to continued life under its regime. Its prisoners tortured and worked to death as slaves. After an initial period where 1/6 the population was genocided. And no one says a word. Why would China ever give back Tibet to the Tibetans ",

Before 1959, all except 5 percent of the Tibetan population were slaves or serfs in a feudal system in which they were regarded as saleable private property, had no land or freedom, and were subject to punishment by mutilation or amputation. The serfs were liable to be tortured or killed. Economy and culture were stagnant for centuries, life expectancy was 35.5 years, illiteracy was over 90 percent, 12 percent of Lhasa\u2019s population were beggars, and the Dalai Lama was responsible for all of this.

(Reproduced from Main Schools of Tibetan Buddhism Author: Chloe Xin): Quote There are four principal schools within modern Tibetan Buddhism: Nyingmapa founded by Padmasambhava, Kagyupa founded by Tilopa (988-1069), Sakyapa created by Gonchok Gyelpo (1034-1102) and his son Gunga Nyingpo (1092-1158), Gelugpa (The Virtuous School) founded by Tsong Khapa Lobsang Drakpa (also called Je Rinpoche) (1357 - 1419).Over the centuries, the Buddhism of Tibet developed into four main streams or lineages known as the \"Four Major Schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\" All of them follow the core beliefs of Buddha Sakyamuni's Four Noble Truths and other teachings. Meanwhile, each school traces its founding in Tibet to a particular person, who in turn is connected to a particular tradition in India. In addition, the colours of hats lamas wear are different among the schools. Nyingmapa (The Red Hats) Nyingmapa (or Nyingma) is the oldest of the Tibetan Buddhist schools and the second largest school of Tibetan Buddhism. The Nyingma school is based primarily on the teachings of Padmasambhava, called Guru Rinpoche, \"Beloved Master,\" who is the founder of Nyingmapa and revered by the Nyingma school as the \"second Buddha.\" Padmascambhava's system of Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism was synthesized by Longchenpa in the 14th century. Along with tantric practices, Nyingma emphasizes revealed teachings attributed to Padmasambhava plus the \"great completion\" or Dzogchen doctrines, also known as ati-yoga (extraordinary yoga). It also makes wide use of shamanistic practices and local divinities borrowed from the indigenous, pre-Buddhist Bon religion. Nyingma monks are not generally required to be celibate. The most recent head of the Nyingma tradition was Mindrolling Trichen, who died in 2008. A successor has not been named.Featured monasteries of Nyingmapa in Tibet: Samye Monastery, Mindroling Monastery, Dorje Drak Monastery. Kagyupa (The White Hats) Kagyupa is the third largest school of Tibetan Buddhism. Its teachings were brought to Tibet by Marpa the Translator, an 11th century Tibetan householder who traveled to India to study under the master yogin Naropa and gather Buddhist scriptures. Marpa's most important student was Milarepa, to whom Marpa passed on his teachings only after subjecting him to trials of the utmost difficulty. In the 12th century, the physician Gampopa synthesized the teachings of Marpa and Milarepa into an independent school. As its name indicates, this school of Tibetan Buddhism places particular value on the transmission of teachings from teacher to disciple. It also stresses the more severe practices of hatha yoga. The central teaching is the \"great seal\" (mahamudra), which is a realization of emptiness, freedom from samsara and the inspearability of these two. The basic practice of mahamudra is \"dwelling in peace,\" and it has thus been called the \"Tibetan Zen.\" Also central to the Kagyupa schools are the Six Doctrines of Naropa (Naro Ch\u00f6drug), which are meditation techniques that partially coincide with the teachings of the Tibetan Book of the Dead.The Kagyupa tradition is headed by the Karmapa Lama. The current head is the Seventeenth Gyalwa Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, who was born in 1985 in the Lhathok region of Tibet. Important Kagyupa teachers include Naropa, Marpa, and Milarepa. Some accounts name Marpa \"The Translator\" (1012-1099) as the founder of the Kagyu school, while other accounts name as the founder Gampopa (1084-1161), also known as Dagpo Lhaje, who was a student of Marpa's disciple Milarepa. Kagyu is best known for its system of meditation and practice called Mahamudra.Featured monasteries of Kagyupa in Tibet: Tsurphu Monastery, Drigung Til Monastery Sakyapa (The Red Hat) Sakyapa is today the smallest of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It is named for the Sakya (\"Gray Earth\") monastery in sourthern Tibet. In 1073, Khon Konchok Gyelpo (1034-l102) built Sakya Monastery in southern Tibet. His son and successor, Sakya Kunga Nyingpo, founded the Sakya sect. The abbots in the Sakya Monastery were devoted to the transmission of a cycle of Vajrayana central teaching and practice called Lamdrey, or \"path and goal\", the systemization of Tantric teachings, and Buddhist logic.The Sakya school had great political influence in the 13th and 14th centuries. Sakya teachers converted the Mongol leaders Godan Khan and Kublai Khan to Buddhism. Over time, the Sakya school gave rise expanded to two subsects called the Ngor lineage and the Tsar lineage. Sakya, Ngor and Tsar constitute the three schools (Sa-Ngor-Tsar-gsum) of the Sakya tradition.The headquarters of the Sakya sect today are at Rajpur in Uttar Pradesh, India. The current head is Ngawang Kunga Theckchen Rimpoche (b. 1945).Featured monasteries of Sakyapa in Tibet: Sakya Monastery Gelugpa (The Yellow Hats) Gelugpa was founded in the late 14th century by Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419), one of Tibet's greatest scholars, who \"enforced strict monastic discipline, restored celibacy and the prohibition of alcohol and meat, established a higher standard of learning for monks, and, while continuing to respect the Vajrayana tradition of esotericism that was prevalent in Tibet, allowed Tantric and magical rites only in moderation.\" The first Gelug monastery, Ganden, was also built by Tsongkhapa in 1409.Gelugpa is the youngest school of Tibetan Buddhism, but is today the largest and the most important. Its tradition is headed by the Dalai Lama. Practices are centered on achieving concentration through meditation and arousing the bodhisattva within. Three large monasteries were quickly established near Lhasa: at Dga'ldan (Ganden) in 1409, 'Bras-spungs (Drepung) in 1416, and Se-ra in 1419. The abbots of the 'Bras-spungs monastery first received the title Dalai Lama in 1578. The Gelugpa school has held political leadership of Tibet since the Dalai Lamas were made heads of state by the Mongol leader G\u00fc\u00fcshi Khan in 1642.Featured monasteries of Gelugpa in Tibet: Drepung Monastery, Sera Monastery, Ganden Monastery, Tashilunpo Monastery.

Drepung monastery, on the outskirts of Lhasa, was one of the world's largest landowners with 185 manors, 25,000 serfs, 300 pastures, and 16,000 herdsmen. High-ranking lamas and secular landowners imposed crippling taxes, forced boys into monastic slavery and pilfered most of the country's wealth \u2013 torturing disobedient serfs by gouging out their eyes or severing their hamstrings.
