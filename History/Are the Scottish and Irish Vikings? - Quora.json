            "answer_text": "Not anymore I assume but Ireland was a Viking stronghold, the city of Dublin was built by the Norse in the 8th century and grew rich off the slave trade. The Vikings of Ireland at some point became two factions- the black and whites. I\u2019m not sure what these entailed but they fought one another. Many of their number fought with Brian Boru to break the power of the Norse, I don\u2019t think there was much of a division between a Viking and Celt on the Emerald Isle, just those with loaded guns and those who dig (as in, the strong and the weak). So yes, there were Irish Vikings. ",
