            "answer_text": " Battle of Haldighati was fought in the year 21 June 1576 The four-hour battle was between Maharana Pratap and Akbar led by Man Singh I of Amber. Akbar\u2019s army had 80,000 soldiers while Maharana\u2019s army consisted of 3,000 soldiers that included Rajputs, Afghans led by Hakim Khan Sur and a small contingent of Bhil tribals. Through Rajput\u2019s zeal and patriotism, Maharana launched a direct attack on the Mughal and later to bring out a quick defeat launched an attack with elephants. Rumours of the Mughal emperor Akbar coming on the battlefield instilled a sense of courage in the Mughal troops and they surrounded Maharana\u2019s army and at the time when Maharana would have certainly been killed, the Naik of Jhala took the crown off Maharana\u2019s head and put it on his own head posing as Maharana and got himself killed. Grabbing an opportunity Rana aimed his spear on Man Singh but unfortunately it pierced his Mahout\u2019s body. The Mughal army once again surrounded Maharana but his favourite horse \u2018Cheetak\u2019 help him to rescue successfully but died as it had sustained injuries. The winner of the battle is still not clear as Mughals suffered heavy casualties and Maharana escaped unhurt. Later Maharana regained control over most of his kingdom. ",
