            "answer_text": "The British goods didn\u2019t appeal to Chinese people due to the federal agricultural nature economy. In late Qing dynasty, most Chinese people farmed and fed themselves, weaved and made cloth by themselves. Thus they had little need for trade goods. The rich people in China in that age, favored porcelain, tea and traditional furniture much more than British goods. The only thing British produced attractive to Chinese people was clock, but this had so little profit. Not until opium trade appears, British couldn\u2019t made money from China. However, they had to pay a great deal of silver for purchasing tea from China. In order to reverse the disadvantage trade trend, British smuggled opium to China, and forced Qing government to sign unjust treaty by two opium wars. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a thing called trade deficit. The most corrosive form is a chronic one without the light at the end of tunnel. Britain had to settle all trade with silver. The quickly dwindling silver reserve is a great threat to Britain. They had to sell something to get their silver back. So they found opium. You can imagine if all trade is settled by gold today, how desperate Americans will be when all the gold in Fort Knox and Manhattan is quickly disappearing. ",
