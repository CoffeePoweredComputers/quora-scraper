This type of thing was the reason for a woman being indisposed. Women were often seen as flaky if they could not meet as expected, but she also absolutely COULD NEVER be caught doing anything unladylike. If she was already out and she had to fart, she would have a sudden illness and need to go home, sending her husband back out after he dropped her off and got her anything she might need help retrieving. Other times she would fake having the vapors or some other malady to excuse her \u201cbehavior\u201d as everyone would politely assume that the \u201cillness\u201d caused it and the lady\u2019s reputation was therefore saved. By the time I was a teen, most people found a way to just say they had to fart. Some would even be polite enough to leave the area. Most only do so if they worry that the fart might be particularly aromatic, lol. ",

In the 50\u2019s though I\u2019ll bet they farted their brains out while their hubby was at work and then tried to hold it in and appear dainty about it in the evening. I think the more important question is did ladies light their own farts in the 50\u2019s or was that a women\u2019s liberation type of thing? ",
