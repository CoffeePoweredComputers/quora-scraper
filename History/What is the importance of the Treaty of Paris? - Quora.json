            "answer_text": "The 1783 Treaty of Paris established the full independence of the United States of America. The crown of Great Britain recognized the United States as a separate, independent, equal, and sovereign state. It established peaceful coexistence between the governments and between the citizens of the United States and the subjects of Great Britain. It also ended the state of war between Great Britain and France, the Netherlands, and Spain. Those three countries had taken the side of the United States in its war of independence. Finally, and not to be overlooked, it generously established the western border of the United States on the Mississippi River, instead of along the Appalachian Mountains. Basically, it doubled the size of the new country. ",
