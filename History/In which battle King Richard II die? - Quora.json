            "answer_text": "Richard II, the son of Edward a/k/a The Black Prince became king by succession at the age of ten. He lost control of the government in 1387 to a group of the aristocracy (The Lord\u2019s Appellant ) but he regained power two years later. Eight years of relative calm followed until Richard exiled or executed most of the \u201cAppellants\u201d. In June of 1399 one of those exiled, Henry of Bolingbroke , invaded England. Gathering forces as he advanced, he met little resistance since Richard was fighting in Ireland and had taken his best knights and yeoman with him including many of the country\u2019s nobility. However there were many nobles who welcomed the removal of Richard Upon Richard\u2019s return the two sides met at Conwy where he met with Henry Percy, the Earl of Northumberland. Without any military action, Richard surrendered after a week and was arrested and placed in the Tower of London by Henry Percy. Richard abdicated his crown. Having deposed Richard, Bolingbroke ascended to the thrown. Bolingbroke had himself crowned as King Henry IV. Richard II did not die in any battle. He died in captivity at Pontefract Castle four months later in 1400. The prevailing wisdom is that he was starved to death. Shakespeare\u2019s play RICHARD II tells a much different tale of Richard\u2019s reign but most interesting is that it is now believed that the Bard was using it as a tool to support his friend the Earl of Essex who was rabid in his belief that Queen Elizabeth was surrendering to the advice of the wrong courtiers. Shakespeare appears to have been drawing an analogy between Richard and now Elizabeth both having been directed and misled by the \u201cwrong courtiers\u201d. Essex tried a revolt but was consequently captured and beheaded. It is widely believed that Shakespeare was taking a bold and perhaps foolhardy writing & producing the play. He even had the play performed after Essex\u2019s arrest apparently to curry support for Essex in his plea for mercy because he was only trying to convince the Queen to choose her advisors better. The play was a success but did nothing for Essex, the only one of the conspirators to be executed. ",
