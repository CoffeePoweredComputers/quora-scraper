            "answer_text": "He was and is one of the finest, highest products of the Spirit of the German Nation, if you want to put it in 19th Century terms. So, much as anything else might count, a Nationalist is bound to exalt him as the noblest part of his nation\u2019s heritage. There\u2019s no escaping that treatment, it\u2019s like writing a book on the history of the English language and trying not to mention Shakespeare. This said, the man himself hated German Nationalism with a passion. He wasn\u2019t an internationalist (although, as a cultured and curious European of his day, he took much of his intellectual identity from dealing with Archilochus, Horace, Dostoevskij and Maupassant), but he\u2019d had a Nationalist phase, up to the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, when he served as a field nurse, which left him quite bummed for two big reasons: 1) Nationalism in his day seemed to kowtow to a staunchly bourgeois and comfortable lifestyle, as far as can be from his vitalistic approach to life and thought; and 2) his animalistic, vital ideal man, striving to become a beyond-man (\u201cOverman\u201d), is perhaps determined, in part, by the circumstances of his birth, but is not so much proud of them as much as his countrymen might be proud of their relation to him. So Nationalism was, in his understanding, a big distraction from striving to get to the \u00dcbermensch. Plus, he was immensely annoyed by Nationalist groups and especially those obscure V\u00f6lkisch or antisemitic clubs and, above all, his sister and her proto-Nazi husband. He went as far, in trying to get those people off him (\u201cThey keep on sending me their damned newsletters!\u201d) as to claim Polish heritage \u2014 probably on account of his surname\u2019s outlandish spelling \u2014 even though he considered that Nation dirty and coarse. Thinking about it, I can\u2019t really think of many modern Nations he didn\u2019t disparage as such (British, Jews, etc.). Talking in terms of cultural/political movements, his ideas can only be appreciated by one precise segment of German Nationalists, the aristocratic, cultured Nationalists, who traditionally have tended to represent Rightwing Nationalism (eg. J\u00fcnger, von Salomon). There\u2019s a few reasons for this, first and foremost the shared (\u201chigh\u201d) culture and aristocratic mentality, but that\u2019s a very rich subject and I\u2019m not going to open that can of worms here. Leftwing Nationalists (eg. those pesky Nationalist Socialists) have historically tended to come from a much lower cultural background than Nietzsche (no shame in that, the man was a University professor before he\u2019d graduated), so their support to his ideas is mostly a token or from hearsay. They quoted him because they thought he was a big, strong German, but couldn\u2019t understand that he would\u2019ve spat in their faces if they\u2019d met. That\u2019s where some superficial spectators later thought they saw some links between him and the Nazis. ",

            "answer_text": "The actual Nazi interest in Friedrich Nietzsche was not anti-Semitism. Although Nietzsche did write several phrases that could be (and were) taken the wrong way. he was never an anti-Semite, and some of his friends were Jewish. The actual Nazi interest in Friedrich Nietzsche was related to Nietzsche\u2019s hatred of Democracy in all its forms. Nietzsche was consistent about this point, from his very first writings to his very final writings. Democracy is for Christians which is a \u201cslave morality,\u201d while truly strong people reject both. For Nietzsche, there were two kinds of people in this world \u2014 the strong minority and the weak majority. The strong were born to rule over the weak. That\u2019s the \u201cmaster morality.\u201d That is how life should really have been, but the Christian movement took over (due to its \u201cresentment\u201d against the strong), and this led to Democracy, which for Nietzsche meant \u201crule by the weakling majority.\u201d The actual Nazi interest in Friedrich Nietzsche was their interpretation that the Aryan race was the \u201cstrong minority\u201d which was destined to rule the world, which was the \u201cweak majority.\u201d To do this, they had to first destroy Democracy and all its forms. They would start with France and England, and then move to Russia. Nazi soldiers carried the books of Nietzsche with them to battle. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is that he's not. The more nuanced answer is that in the last years of his life, he came to suffer very severe mental illness and his sister took over his estate. She and her husband could be considered something like proto-nazis. They released work under his name and edited it to make it seem like it would support hypernationalist ideals. Nietzsche himself was way too much an individualist to ever be much of a nationalist. ",
