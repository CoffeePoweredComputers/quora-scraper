            "answer_text": "As a israel , Palestine does not exist. The civilians of so called Palestine are arabs who live in Israel. This whole concept of another land for the arabs started in 1948 , after Israel declared independence. We had a civil war and won. Actually , we won several wars between us and the surrounding arab states. So , why is Palestine still a concept? After being \" founded \" in 1988 ( that's right. 40 years after israel was formed ) there has been total chaos for owning that little piece of land. Obviously , if you choose to take israel's side then you're a heartless Zionist that kills innocent children. Believe it or not , but I live next to an Arab village ( I am a Jew-Moroccan so we settled here ) and every time there's a terror attack that hurts innocent citizens there are fireworks and parties until the sunrise. Seeing that as a little child made me lose empathy. We fight for a home constantly. Nobody wants us obviously and we have to fight for the little we have. I still find it petty for the Arabs to want it so badly and be willing to kill so many for it while they obviously have quite a few of their own. We have offered many peace arrangements to this so called state that doesn't even have a territory and they were sadly all dismissed. How can we get to peace when they want to eat the whole cake? I personally think this conflict is absurd. How can people keep calling an official state another name? How is this even normal? Can you imagine calling the USA another name just because some citizens of a minority decide that they want it all to their selves? Can you imagine negotiating with such an absurd group? That's why I can't take Palestine supporters seriously. Take a flight to Palestine , I dare you. You will soon find out that it's Israel. Let's embrace what it is. A little country surrounded by enemies and STILL surviving. Thriving! Sadly to the rest of the world , we have god on our side. we were raised in an environment where we were hated. We always had. There is only israel. As it is on all the documents. As it is on the Bible. As it is until the day the world will go down in flames. ",

            "answer_text": "This question confuses an area of land with a nation. Israel is made up of a different area of land, the Negev, and other sites, yet it is a nation. In days past, Palestine referred to a geographical area, an area that encompasses what today is Israel, parts of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and the Sinai.  We can go back in time, the claim there was a Palestine before the Romans renaming the area is nonsense, there is a Greek Historian that called it by such a name, but the natives did not. In the first century the area was like this:  There was a territory called Palestinia by the ancient Romans and later the Byzantines after the Jewish revolt and removal of most Jews, this territory looked like this:  The Byzantines broke the area up like this:  The thing to note is this land was never sovereign; it was a territory first of the Romans, then of the Byzantines. The Muslims later conquered this land, never once during their control of the area did it know sovereignty, it passed from Caliph to Caliph through treaty or conquest, the Ottomans finally capturing it in the 1500s and holding it until 1918. There was the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but this was a Crusader kingdom:  This is the only time from the time of the Roman conquest until the time of Israel\u2019s re-founding that the area knew any self-rule. In all of this time, there was never once a sovereign entity known as Palestine, that would mean that Palestine, as a geographical area, does indeed exist, but the nation which controls that land today is Israel, except for Gaza and areas A and B of Judaea and Samaria (parts of the land called \u201cThe West Bank\u201d during nineteen years of illegal Jordanian occupation).

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t like to entangle myself in the Palestine-Israel conflict, but there seems to be so many narrow-minded answers here that I think it\u2019s necessary to set the record straight before more misinformation spreads. All those claiming that Palestine \u2018never existed\u2019 are either: A: delusionalB: blind idiotsFrom a purely logical standpoint, Palestine exists. Unfortunately from 1948 until today, most of Palestine has been captured and colonized by a people called the European Jews, after receiving the land as a gift from the British. I still don\u2019t understand how either the Jews rationalized doing to the Palestinians what they shriek has been done to them, but that\u2019s a conversation for another time. Anyhow, a simple search tells you that:  the state of Israel was formed on 1948. Rationally speaking, before that, Israel did not exist (and do not reply with \u2018but Israel existed 3800 years ago\u2019. Thousands of societies existed back then, but we don\u2019t call Arizona, Hohokam do we?). If Israel did not exist before 1948, then the land must have been called something else. And indeed it has! It was the British Mandate of Palestine:  But again, this region was only called Palestine from 1917 (when the Ottoman Empire was disbanded) until 1948. So it must\u2019ve been called something else before then when it was part of the Ottoman empire, right?  This is a map from the 1895. Remember, from 1918 till back to the 15th century, this region was part of the Ottoman Empire. Well, still called Palestine! Under their rule, this region over the course of the 5 centuries spanned different Vilayets (provinces): the Vilayet of Beirut, the Vilayet of Syria, the Vilayet of Jerusalem (as you can see in the color-coded regions above). Nonetheless, the region (which again, spanned multiple vilayets) was still referred to as Palestine. Now let\u2019s go back even further:  Well, looky here! This map is from 17th century. Still called Palestine (Palastina is a variation of the same name). Any \u2018Israel\u2019 in sight? Nope. Let\u2019s go back even further: This is an Arabic map from the 16th century.  It says \u201cLand of Palestine\u201d in top left corner to the right of the compass. But hey, Arabs are pro-Palestine and might\u2019ve manipulated the map to make it seem like Palestine exists when it doesn\u2019t right? Take a look:  A French map by a French explorer. He also called the region Palestine. any Israel in sight? Nope. What about this one from the 15th century:  Take a look at the red box in bottom right corner: \"Palaestinae Sive Totius Terrae Promissionis\" which translates to \"Palestine, the whole of the Promised Land\". If the Promised Land is Israel and Palestine has never existed, why call it Palestine? But hey, we need to go back even further, before the conception of the Ottoman state. Surely then, Palestine wasn\u2019t called Palestine!    Well, guess not! These maps are from the 14th, 7th and 4th century respectively. And yet all label Palestine and no mention of Israel. I can go on and on until the earliest maps we have in human possession. But I don\u2019t want this post to drag on. Moral of the post: Palestine has existed and been recognized by countries from all over the world for a couple thousand of years. The last time that the Holy Land region was called Israel (pre-1948 that is) was around 3000 BC. From that point until 1948 when Britain took the land of one people and gave it to foreigners, the region was called and recognized as Palestine. Today, millions of people continuously stand against the Zionist-loving politicians who aim to annihilate Palestine. But as long as these maps are proof, Palestine has, is and will exist. ",

            "answer_text": "Nation states are political fictions. Governments exist. Ethnic groups exist. National identities exist. When the government, national identity and ethnicity coincide; you see a stability that we term as a nation state. Unfortunately, the result of World War I was the fracturing of the Ottoman Empire along lines that do not coincide with national identity nor ethnicity. The disastrous peace process of World War I pretty much guaranteed World War II. Much of the peace process after World War II has been an unmitigated disaster for the people of the Middle East. So we do not have governments ruling areas with people of similar national identity or ethnic grouping. In the area you are talking about, you have several competing governments with various national identities and ethnic groups. There are non-Jewish Arabs who identify with Israeli nationality and are ruled by the Israeli government. There are Jews who identify with Israeli nationality and are ruled by Israeli government. Those are stable nation state structures. Neither the Palestinian Authority nor Hamas have been able to govern the people who identify as Palestinians. A large part of the reason for that is that their neighbors do not trust them to actually govern. For example, Egypt very clearly does not trust Hamas to be able to govern Gaza in a way that will not be problematic for its sovereignty. Jordan feels the same about the West Bank and the Palestinian Authority. Syria feels the same about southern Lebanon. Israel feels the same about all three. So the ethnic group that identifies with the Palestinian national identity is not governed by a corresponding government. There is no Palestine as a nation state the way Israel, Egypt and Jordan exist as nation states. Syria, Lebanon, central Iraq and Kurdistan also suffer from the same problem right now. ",

All this is just smoke and mirrors. It is all meaningless. Hardly any country in the world today could exist if those who used to live in it a thousand years or more ago can claim a legal right over it. Could the Welsh who were the original British and living in a place now called England buy land in England and then claim that because they used to own it no Englishman can now even enter it or live there. This kind of thing is ridiculous. The State of Israel has legal borders and legal borders are those approved by the United Nations. It is the UN that makes borders legal or illegal. So Israel exists, certainly, within its present legal borders and with a legal, United Nations proviso that the capital of Israel is not Jerusalem until the issue of sharing it, in some, way with a future Palestinian State has been agreed. This is called international \u201claw\u201d. Even though the UN cannot enforce these laws it is completeness useless for Israel to say they are irrelevant and can be ignored. The UN voted 136 to 9 to accept that Palestine was \u201cipso facto\u201d a country aiming at a future, legal Palestinian state and that it was to be immediately referred to as \u201cThe State of Palestine\u201d in all UN correspondence. So, one way or another there are two states here and they need to get along and agree to that as the first step in a permanent solution. The Palestinians have repeatedly confirmed their acceptance of the State of Israel within its present borders. The world awaits, now, for Israel to agree the same thing and reciprocate. Surely that can\u2019t be THAT difficult to do! ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s not a simple question and there is no right answer. The area was first called Palestine after the defeat of the Jews so as to distance it in name from Judah as the Jews called it. The area of ancient Palestine included areas of Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel. When Briton was given the Mandate over the area of Palestine, the idea was to set up a homeland for the Jews and a homeland for the Palestinians. To that effect, they first siphoned off Jordan (the largest part of Palestine) and handed it off to the Hashemite Kingdom. Over 50% of the Palestinians in the world lived within Jordan and over 50% of Jordan were Palestinians\u2026 Then came the problem of satisfying the Jews and the Palestinians. Now, who are the Palestinians? If you ask Hamas Minister of the Interior and of National Security Fathi Hammad, he is quoted as saying \u201cPersonally, half my family is Egyptian. We are all like that. More than 30 families in the Gaza Strip are called Al-Masri [\u201cEgyptian\u201d]. Brothers, half of the Palestinians are Egyptians and the other half are Saudis.\u201d You can see this at:  The idea then was to split the area left between the Jews (in Israel) and the Palestinians (in Palestine). The problem is that the Arabs have never accepted this division. Fathi Hamad, Hamas Member of Parliament, to al-Aalam Iranian television in Arabic, 15 March 2007: \"Hamas rejects the Arab [peace] initiative and wants Palestine from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea. If today Israel cannot be beaten militarily, it will be possible in the future.\" Sami Abu-Zuhri, Hamas leader in Gaza, to Hamas TV, 6 April 2007: \"These are the founding Hamas principles on which we raise our children and in which we believe: Armed resistanceNon-recognition of the occupation in any formAll Palestine from the river to the seaThe holy places and JerusalemThe right of returnMash'al prior to the Arab summit: \"It is time the Arabs fixed a strategy, we shall not agree to concessions. The series of concessions must be stopped. There will be no concessions on Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa or the right of return. \u2026 None of the cards of violence must be lost, we must keep the option of resistance in Palestine. That way is not dead.\" Anti-Israel statements by Hamas leaders after Palestinian coalition government Prior to 1948, the Jewish English newspaper was called The Palestine Post, later the name was changed to Jerusalem Post. This Week in History: \u2018The Palestine Post\u2019 is established Does Palestine exist, or is it Israel? Israel is the name of the state that declared independence in May 1948. Israel is the homeland of the Jews, a democratic country with liberties and rights for all minorities (except the Jewish minorities, but that\u2019s a different problem). Palestine, de facto exists in the areas that are considered the pre-1967 borders, meaning the West Bank and Gaza. ",

This is very important because the idea that this is a political conflict rather than geoethnic lends itself perfectly to the Zionist and even \u201cpacifist\u201d argument (as in DVK's reply) for the two-state solution, based on the premise that both groups have \"equal right\" over the land because there has been neither an Arab nor an Israeli legal state on that land ever before the UN partition. But if we recognize the important fact that this has been first and foremost an ethnic conflict on one side of which we have Palestinian Arabs who've been living on the land of Palestine for a good number of centuries (that's why they came to be called \u201cPalestinian\u201d after all) before the Zionist movement and the UN partition; and on the other, a group of alien foreigners (Jews) forcing themselves upon this indigenous ethnic group via terror, land usurpation and flawed legalities introduced and supported by UN veto-wielding member states against the consent of both Palestinian Arabs AND regional Arab states (as ones with natural and political claim over the land already), then formation of Israeli would count as nothing less than a legally dressed-up land usurpation and ethnic cleansing of an indigenous population. Moreover, the fact that the Ottoman Empire to whom the land and the people of Palestine previously belonged, was destroyed by the same states (Britain, France and US) who founded the UN and blessed themselves with the veto power, and later supported the formation of the Jewish state in Palestine, is in fact a further testimony about tyrannical alien role in imposition of an alien people and state over a defenseless war-hit indigenous population. So I think based on the above insight, the position of Palestinians and countries like Iran becomes well established. Free study: 1947 UN Partition ProposalSource: Islam Stack Exchange ",

It was part of several different empires for 2000 years and was not ruled by Jews but rather It was ruled by the Romans, Byzantines (Eastern Romans), Arabs , Crusaders , Turks, Circassians and others , until the First World War, Britain managed to defeat the Ottoman Empire and take over Palestine Britain allowed European Jews to immigrate to Palestine to establish a national home for them there. The majority of the population of Palestine were Muslim Arabs, some of whom were Jews and Christians , European Jews were without a country at the time The Jews gradually took over the lands of the Palestinian population by building settlements, buying lands and displacing many local residents, as European Jews founded many armed militias and clashes accrued between them and the local residents of Palestine In 1948 the Jews declared the state of Israel, which included more than half of the land of Palestine, according to the United Nations partition plan, which was rejected by the Arab countries that declared war on Israel, which ended with the cease-fire Egypt and Jordan seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which was supposed to be part of an Arab country which was later would be called Palestine. In 1967, Israel invaded the West Bank and Gaza, destroyed the homes of the local population, and built Jewish settlements Palestine as a state, does not exist due to the Jordanian-Egyptian takeover in 1948, the Israeli invasion in 1967, Palestine exists as an idea .

            "answer_text": "Israel is a State. It has a government and is recognzied by most of the world. On the other hand Palestine is a nation that seeks independence. Some call it a \u201cProto-State\u201d, a state in the process of gaining its independence. According to the International Community the recognized territory of Israel does not overlap the territory that the Palestinians (mainly represented by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and it\u2019s factions in international affairs) claim as their territory. Furthermore in 1993 the State of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization signed the \u201cOslo I\u201d accord, which included Israel\u2019s recognition of the Palestinian people and the Palestinians recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist. The majority of the Arab/Muslim countries that don\u2019t officially reocgnize the State of Israel does not oppose it existance, but continue not to recognize it until there will be a final settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Today the Palestinians have a national body called the \u201cPalestinian National Authority\u201d which acts as a government of the Palestinian residents in the West Bank (Where it has authority over 40% of the territory) and Gaza Strip (Where it has authority over 100% of the territory) which are the two pieces that form the internationally regared as \u201cOccupied Palestinian Territory\u201d, which is designated for a future Palestinian state. Lastly there is a de-jure country named the \u201cState of Palestine\u201d which was declared by the PLO in 1988 during the Palestinians\u2019 first national uprising (commonly known as the \u201cFirst Intifada\u201d) and this state has recognition but all of it is only symbolic and the State of Palestine havent yet came into existance and only stands as a legal instrument, until a peace treaty (or something else) will create an independent Palestinian State.

Palestine was called Philistine in Biblical times and goes back up to 3800 years in the Levant, the strip of land that today contains Palestine, Israel and Lebanon. The Romans changed the name 2000 years ago to match their language and also to embarrass the Arabic Semitic Hebrews of Biblical Israel. So Israel was called Palestine in the time of Christ. Today all that\u2019s left of Palestine is the occupied West Bank, where apartheid is the law of the land and the Gaza Strip, under Israeli military blockade. Biblical Israel was ended by the Romans in 70 AD. The Arabic Semitic Hebrews, who came from what is now Iraq (Mesopotamia) according to the Jewish Torah (first five books of the Old Testament), have the Sephardi Jews of today as their decendents (the name is due to many of them living in Spain in the Middle Ages until expelled back to North Africa). The Ashkenazim Jews of today are more than 80% purely European based on well-publicized genetic studies and were mostly thus descended from converters going back to Roman times; http://www.the-scientist.com/?ar.... The Palestinians are mostly Arabic, but believed to have a bit of Greek ancestry from the Sea People invasions of 3200 years ago, that had profound and permanent effects on the Eastern Mediterranean to this day.

There was an Israel in ancient times, for a relatively brief period, which arrived by way of invasion only to disappear under the Roman Empire. The people did not disappear, however. They were simply absorbed into the empire, many will have changed religion under the Romans and later the Muslims, and it is quite possible that some of today\u2019s Palestinians are descended from the ancient Israelis - though with thousands of years having elapsed the traces would likely be heavily diluted and miniscule. The modern state of Israel is a colonial project inspired by a book of religion, and carried out by Europeans with no cultural, linguistic or ancestral ties to the Middle East. It bears a close resemblance to white rule in Kenya and the Apartheid regime in South Africa, or the Raj in India for that matter. So it certainly exists, but the extent of its authenticity is certainly questionable. Should the international community accept colonization, ethnic cleansing and Apartheid in the 21st century? Is this a legitimate basis for nationhood?? ",

Bizzarely, some extremists actually go the lengths of denying that a Palestine ever even existed, despite numerous mentions throughout history, maps clearly showing it etc. There is a large group of people who identify themselves as Palestinians - recognised in the UN and pretty much everywhere else, outside of the extremists who want to justify the occupation on the basis that the place they are occupying, simply does not exist. There has never however, been an independent state of Palestine. Ignore anyone trying to put forward justifications for actions of either side - these are all biased opinions based on subjective views and usually ignoring the evidence staring them in the face. If you want honest answers to these questions - look at who is responding and what their angle is. ",

Responses like the one you are reading are exactly what will cause this to never end. Denial of existence is why would you expect no peace to be there soon. Arabs want to deny the fact it was Israel although it is stated in Quran and in our History, and as you see in the comments, Palestine (Which existed for a long time, due to wars and arabs invasion etc, yet it did exist ) and for a long time too is also not recognized. How can you tell either people you do not exist, or you should not be existing ? Also the other minor problem, to me at least, is why the name is so important ? The land had changed names, no one can really deny what it was called except for the arrogance of dictators trying to eliminate each other. We deserve to co-exist - end of story. ",

People in Italy used to identify much more with their region than with with Italy as a whole. Thus someone might say they were Piedmontese or Neapolitan, but would probably not have said they were Italian. However that changed very rapidly. Out of these regional identities, partly stimulated by resistance to the interference of foreign powers, these regional identities gave rise to a national identity and the Kingdom of Italy was born. Something similar has happened with Palestine. Palestinians have long felt a strong bond with particular localities, and they continue to do so. However a national consciousness grew around this, as it did in many other parts of the world. The Zionists\u2019 declared intention to steal the land of Palestine from the Palestinians (which the Zionists saw as reclaiming the land from squatters) obviously accelerated this process, but it had already been underway before the first Zionist settlers arrived in Palestine. So the Palestinian nation is now quite real, and ironically, it is in part the actions of the Zionists that have made it so. ",

However, there has never been a country named Palestine. Nor there is a people known as \u201cPalestinians\u201d. The \u201cPalestinian people\u201d was invented in 1967 after the overwhelming Israeli victory over Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the Six Day War. It was and remains a false name given to the terrorist organization PLO to lend legitimacy to its attempts to destroy Israel. Those who don\u2019t want to believe this should try and find any pre-1967 reference to the \u201cPalestinian people\u201d. Israel, on the other hand, is a country that most certainly exists. ",

Area C on the West Bank is in limbo. It is, however, completely under Israeli control. They should annex it for security reasons, in my opinion. I personally also consider Jordan as Palestine. This is historically true, but most people are unaware of it. And it's very hard to convince them. ",
