            "answer_text": "The technology (tactics, equipment, organisation knowledge) of defence exceeded the technology of attack. It\u2019s very easy to use your bolt action rifles, rapid-firing artillery, and machine guns, to defend a prepared position. It is very easy to use trains to reinforce your army and send supplies to your army at the front. It\u2019s very easy to take attack off the table with gas, and it\u2019s very easy to use barbed wire to terribly slow the pace of men and horses. It is very hard to directly attack machine guns. And there were machine-guns everywhere. This changed when better equipment was issued, and coordinated attacks, with highly accurate and powerful artillery were pioneered. It is very hard to reinforce your exhausted soldiers across a quagmire of mud and barbed wire and shell craters. This changed once they invented tanks, reliable motor cars, and highly coordinated supply divisions, supported by more productive factories. It is very hard to perform tactics like creeping barrages, and rapid fire support, and is very hard to safely and quickly move up your artillery once the frontline starts moving. This changed once they invented self propelled artillery, tanks, a great deal of practical experience, directional artillery locators, better telegraph networks and radios. It is very hard to focus your forces with the technology and training available at the time, as the firepower of the average rifleman was very poor, as even a surprise attack was slow and impotent. This changed when they increased the amount of machineguns by a factor of 20, issued hand and rifle grenades, submachineguns, flamethrowers, wirecutters, light machineguns, and shotguns to low level infantry units. And all this was complicated by the fact that there were very large armies fighting across a very narrow front. The Russian front had any number of factors that prevented trench warfare from being a major factor. Lack of rail lines allowing for surprise attacks to succeed before reinforcements could be shipped in. Smaller armies, across twice as large a front. Not enough artillery to properly stop infantry, and wide enough terrain to allow cavalry to retain a significant role, and thus operational mobility. ",

            "answer_text": "Picture it like this: To really long trenches a few hundred or thousand meters opposite of each other, one army goes into the midddle to attack the others they are shot, so one side develops long range weapons, cannons, tanks and planes and so the other side copies them. Then the first side finds a way to stop their planes and tanks, the second side copies them. One side uses gas so then the other do as well. See my point? They were stuck in trenches and whenever one side did something the other did as well, you simply sat and waited then charged, retreated and repeated the cycle. ",
