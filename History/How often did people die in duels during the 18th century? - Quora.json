            "answer_text": "Duels were not always 'to the death'. There were several general conditions that were respected for the most part. These could be changed by arrangement of the parties involved (primarily the offended one). At the choice of the offended party, the duel could be fought to a number of conclusions: To first blood, in which case the duel would be ended as soon as one man was wounded, even if the wound was minor.Until one man was so severely wounded as to be physically unable to continue the duel.To the death (or \"\u00e0 l'outrance\"), in which case there would be no satisfaction until one party was mortally wounded.In the case of pistol duels, each party would fire one shot. If  neither man was hit and if the challenger stated that he was satisfied,  the duel would be declared over. If the challenger was not satisfied, a  pistol duel could continue until one man was wounded or killed, but to  have more than three exchanges of fire was considered barbaric and, on  the rare occasion that no hits were achieved, somewhat ridiculous. There was also the practice of 'deloping' which literally means 'throwing away'. It amounts to an intended miss to save face and avoid killing someone else or drawing an accurate shot from an opponent.  Many times the flintlocks were not accurate at any significant distance so a 'miss' could be counted as deloping or as a legitimate miss. Seems like everything changed when they went from swords to handguns. ",

            "answer_text": "In reality, hardly ever. Duels were quite formulaic; Sword duelling generally went no further than \u201c first blood\u201d Not that it wasn\u2019t good swordsmanship; but the wounding thrust was often pulled at the last second, thus producing a light wound. Honour was satisfied all round; both parties had accepted the challenge, had turned up, and had fought. Death wasn\u2019t much of a solution. Pistol duels were also formulaic; distance, number of paces; aim and fire; in some formulas, taking turns to fire. using quite low power pistols with a small charge at a considerable distance; good chance of missing; low power bullet not likely to cause a fatal wound ( especially when wearing a thick braided top coat overca silk shirt). And people often chose to miss. It was about honour. In many cases, deaths were an accident. ",
