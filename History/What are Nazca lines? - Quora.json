            "answer_text": "Nazca lines are a group of giant geoglyps (land pictures or motifs) in the Nazca desert of Southern Peru. Some pictures of Nazca lines :    These lines were created between 500 BC and 500 CE. These lines are created by the ancient nazca culture of South America. They depict various plants, animals and other shapes. The 2000 year old nazca lines can only be fully appreciated when viewed from the air given their massive size. These geoglyps are 10 - 15 cm deep and are between 0.4-1.1 km wide. Their combined length is 1300 km. They cover an area of 50 Sq. Km. They were made by scrapping off the top layer of reddish brown - iron oxide - coated pebbles to reveal a yellow grey sub soil. There are three basic types of Nazca lines - straight lines, geomatric lines and pictorial representations. These lines were designated as UNESCO's world heritage site in 1994. But despite of being studied for 80 yrs these lines are still a mystery for researchers. Some associate these lines with religious beliefs and some with aliens. But the real purpose of these lines is still mysterious. Footnotes: Nazca Lines - Wikipedia The Nasca Lines Are One of Peru's Mysteries Nazca Lines | HISTORY Thank you. ",
