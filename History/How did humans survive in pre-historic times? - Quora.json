            "answer_text": "Historic times is are rather late in human existance: writing and calendar originate around 5300 years ago in couple places in the Middle East; a thousand or two years after that in East Asia and Central America. I will refine your question to mean before farming and settlement which is up to 4000 years before then. Anatomically modern human beings- skulls and teeth- appeared 300,000 years ago. Evidence of clothing and boats go to 70,000 years ago. So using either date as start of modern humans, 87% to 97% of human existance was before agriculture. Anthropologists believe most of human existance people subsided by hunting, fishing and gathering food. Some of these societies persisted into modern times and were studied by scientists. Consider the variety of Native American societies: some farmed maize while others did not farm at all. They hunted deer, bison, rabbits, marine mammals, and fished. They gathered nuts, berries, fruits, roots, leaves. Some studies say some groups could gather enough to eat in as little as ten hours a week leaving plenty of time for crafts, socializing and other leisure. ",

            "answer_text": "They co-operated with eachother. They shared information, orally and later in writing. This is hugely important since human memories, language skills and ability to predict the results of future actions give them massive advantages in surviving. Early humans could warn eachother of danger, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of predators and prey and could plan together in incredibly complex ways. These abilities made humans very good hunters and allowed them to organise mutual defence. They made tools. Humans can make incredibly complex tools and have far more ability in this area than any other animal. Humans with spears can kill pretty much anything, if they know what they are doing. Luckily we have the language and social skills to teach eacther how to use a spear. We can also share skills like fire-making, skinning and cooking animals, finding clean water, making a hand-axes and many more. They were endurance hunters. Humans can run a long distance at a moderate speed. We\u2019re not fast enough to escape predators like lions but that\u2019s where our skills in mutual defence and tool making come in. But we can pursue a prey animal until it is exhausted and easier to kill. They walked upright, which allowed them to carry tools and weapons while running and to develop a powerful throw. Humans can throw objects harder than any other primate, despite being physically weaker than other great apes. Other animals didn\u2019t have a chance, as history shows! ",
