            "answer_text": "I am a bit biased, as I study physics, but let's see if I can shed a bit of light on the question. Mathematicians are very smart folks, as are chemists, biologists, computer scientists, nurses, doctors, and engineers; just about every stem field boasts a higher than average IQ. Mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists tend to be at the upper end of that spectrum, with philosophers and economists also taking a high ranking. It takes only a quick reflection of the kinds of reasoning most IQ tests are actually testing to see why. Mathematicians lead in abstract reasoning, computer scientists in linear reasoning, philosophers in linguistic reasoning, and economists with a mix of the three. But, the reason physicists often top the charts has to do with the fact that their study incorporates all of these areas of reasoning, with leading spacial reasoning abilities. Physicists use mathematics as one component of the language they use to communicate their ideas and discoveries, alone with a heavy linguistic component which is what incorporates the ideas, arguments, and systems into their writing. Physicists are second only to mathematicians in quantitative and abstract reasoning, second to philosophers and linguists in terms of verbal reasoning, second or third to computer scientists and mathematicians in terms of linear abilities (as most physicists use A LOT of programming), and lead all fields in terms of spacial abilities. Most IQ scores are what is referred to as full scale, that being that only high scores in all subtests will translate to a high IQ number. A relative but significant deficit in any one sub test can drag down the full scale score. The basic skills and abilities that make for a successful physics student (and ultimately a successful physicist) provide for high development in all of the areas of intelligence IQ tests examine, which often translates to physicists holding the title \u201csmartest of the smartest.\u201d Another thing to consider is the breadth and philosophical meaning of the field, which is not only what attracts most physics students, but also something most highly intelligent+ individuals tend to value. Global problems, fundemental natures, order and beauty, surrounding systems which matter and hold significance in every individual's day to day life. If a gifted individual can make it past the academic rigor of college, they will likely find a wonderful challenge in physics and find a home among those peers. Physicists research and solve problems for their own sake, they are not building a landing gear, or working to find profitable solutions to human problems, or seeking to enforce a logical consistency in a system of games and rules like engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians. Physics is one of 3 fields at the base of human knowledge, sharing the foundation of that pyramid with philosophy and mathematics, coming later than either but covering more area than both. All modern sciences owe credit to physics in some form or another, and a solid grasp of the field empowers any physicist to speak intelligently about any other topic, as the learning curve is relatively steep toward the end of their degree (a little time investment reaping many fruits of new knowledge). Sit down and watch some lectures on maxwell's equations, it is absolutely amazing that just about every standard equation describing an electromagnetic system is a derivation from the variables of that system and one or more of maxwell's equations. And that is still considered \u201cclassical\" physics. You get tensors, partial differential equations, probability and statistics, and new applications of all of the classical fields once you arrive in the early 20th century, and today we have topologies, group theory, and highly abstract mathematical objects sitting at the forefront of contemporary physics research. There are tools of greater size, power, and complexity than the world has ever seen. Every field of engineering you can think of was likely founded by, or gets most of its roots from, some field of physics. And some areas, such as quantum mechanics, have yet to spawn their own engineering fields, which means physicists are still key members of engineering teams designing communications satellites and wireless communications systems. GPS requires a physicist to develop the general relativity correction systems to adjust time measurements for time dialations due to orbital altitude and velocity, energy research almost always requires or benefits from a physicist team member. While this is all a bit off topic, it does drive home the significance and importance of the field, which for those with very high intelligence seeking to leave some impact or add some value to the world, remains an extremely important consideration when choosing a field. It must be said, as well, that one does not need high 130s IQ scores to study physics; there are extremely intelligent folks as well as folks closer to the stem average studying and doing physics. The higher average IQ simply reflects the clustering of high IQ and higher than average IQ folks working in the field. Physics, like any discipline, will provide the determined student with all of the skills and abilities needed to be successful in its study, and might even boost your IQ performance along the way by shaping and reinforcing all those new neural pathways ;) We are a strange bunch, geeky and at times intense, but we love sharing our knowledge and you'll never be in want of willing tutors. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "(1) Physicists have better, more reliable tools. Consequently, their knowledge about their field is more reliable than the knowledge of even the smartest person in other fields, about his field. So they seem smarter. (2) The ability to consistently use these tools require logical thinking. (3) Logical thinking is usually associated with intelligence, and reliable knowledge with being smart. Now I\u2019ll detail. (1) Physicists have better, more reliable tools. In identical conditions, nature always behaves the same. Do an experiment how many times you want, and you\u2019ll get the same result (well, in quantum theory you don\u2019t get the same result, but you get each result with the same probability. In other sciences things are much more unpredictable, so it is much more difficult to make exact models of phenomena. This is because for a physicist, who works with the simplest phenomena, it is much easier to arrange the experiment in identical conditions. So in physics, experiments are much more reliable than in other fields, because they are more easier to arrange and to reproduce, and are about more elementary phenomena. Because of this, it is also easier to make logical deductions. If you rely on propositions that are always true, you get true results. If you rely on propositions that are sometimes true, or even in most cases, the exceptions are very present. Now, in other field you have facts, but the facts in physics being simpler and more general, you can deduce easier from them other facts, and it is easier to apply logic and mathematics. In physics you study the simplest phenomena, while in other fields, those phenomena are very complex combinations of many simple physical phenomena. Because of this complexity it is much more difficult to predict in other fields. In addition, the values you measure in physics are more exact, you can repeat the same experiment and see they are the same. In other fields, they depend on much more factors. Physics also requires you to make hypotheses, but it is simpler to verify the hypotheses because of the reliable tools. In other fields of science it is more difficult to verify the hypotheses. (2) The ability to consistently use these tools require logical thinking. You can realize much quicker that you are good or not at physics and mathematics, than in other fields. This is because the tasks lead to exact results, so if you didn\u2019t get the right result, you did it wrong. In other fields, you can compensate much better with other abilities. So if you are less logical, there\u2019s a difference, but you can\u2019t fully use logic anyway because the field is more complex than physics. You use instead specific intuitions for that field, and you rely more on memory than on memory+deduction. (3) Logical thinking is usually associated with intelligence, and reliable knowledge with being smart. So, because physicists can rely easier on logical thinking, and are actually required to do this, this is an essential factor when you decide to be a physicist, and when you\u2019re accepted to be. So somehow physics attract slightly more logical thinkers than other fields, which rely on logic too, but can compensate easier with other abilities. In addition, physicists look more intelligent, because they know things that \u201claymen\u201d don\u2019t understand. With common intuition you can easier understand something from less fundamental fields, because they are closer to our experience, and because in their development intuition had an important role. But to understand physics, you need to go through the experiments and mathematics, and to rebuild your intuition. So it is likely that physicists may look smarter than other persons, in average. Not that they necessarily are, but because they are more difficult to understand just from discussions. And, since physics has the most reliable facts, verified by repeated experiments, when a physicist says something about physics is more likely to be right, than when an expert from another field about his field (except when we talk about factual data). And a layman may happen to not believe the physicist about some phenomena, because modern physics is counterintuitive, and it turns out that the physicist was right, so it appears as being smarter. Since other fields rely more on classifying things than deducing them one from another, when they state a fact they just look informed, but not necessarily more intelligent, because you think that you could have that information too. But for facts about physics you have to go through them and to understand at least a bit of the math behind them. ",
