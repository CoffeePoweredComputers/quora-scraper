            "answer_text": "One measure of the Vikings prowess was their reputation that led to them Acting at the Verangian Guard for the court of Byzantine Empire.  They were known bad asses whose reputation preceded them.  Now, in the days before, electronics everything was pretty much word of mouth, so it was no mean feat that they were so well known and feared that they were recruited way down in what is modern day Turkey. Based on study of weapons, history and human nature, I would say that what they did has been embellished a bit.  But seriously, I don't think TV or the movies actually do justice to how horrifying and ugly a medieval battle field actually was. Take a look a any of the tapestry images from the day, severed heads, arms and legs abound.  Today forensic studies, show just how brutal and vicious the wounds were.  It seems now from battlefield archeological evidence, that going as far back as the first kingdom of Egypt, that the leg was a favorite target for a sword or spear.  Cut the leg or foot, and the man goes down rendering him helpless so that even a club wielding levee can give him the coup de grace.  Skeletal wounds bear this out showing cut wounds to the feet and legs followed by multiple fatal wounds to the head and face.  Logically, it makes sense, why bother chopping a guys legs and feet if you have already driven a ax through his skull?   So compare a medieval battlefield of say 10,000 men to a side, so 20,000 men where 5000 are killed and another 2000 wounded.  We are talking chopping and penetrating wounds.  Men missing limbs, and other mutilating wounds who drop where they fell, the only evacuation was if they could crawl off on their own power.  Hundreds of men lying in a welter of blood and viscera, not to mention piss, shit and mud. Even wounds, great gaping slices, guts hanging out, hands and feet missing, bit sections of skull shorn off the living.  Despite what Hollywood would have you believe a stab to the chest or arrow to the belly or sword to the back does not mean sudden death.  It does only if an artery is severed and you bleed out.  More likely it means a lingering painful death by slow exsanguination, or worse days of lingering while infection and blood poisoning does the job. Do we see this on all the Viking sagas on the tube?  No we don't.  We see the occasional limb severed and relatively bloodless battlefields with people recovering from wounds that would have been historically a death sentence. Even such laughers that are or were thought high art, such a Braveheart do not due justice to the actual brutality of the battlefield. Of interest was the discovery of I believe it was 33 or more bodies in an medieval quarry that at the time was alongside a main trade road between Wessex and the surrounding Viking held lands.  The bodies found were all Vikings, the sub sect of warriors who filed their teeth to points, the so called special ops Vikings, the real bad asses.  Seems they were captured on a foray into Wessex, forced to strip and then calmly beheaded and stacked in the quarry for all to see, with their heads neatly stacked at their feet.  Three bodies were missing matching heads and it was assumed that these older bodies, were the leaders, and their heads had been mounted on pikes alongside the road as a kind of advertisement. So I guess the lesson is that not everyone thought the Vikings were such overwhelming bad asses.  Farmers, defenseless women and children undoubtedly, but they were in reality just large statured (by continental European standards) ferocious and apparently fearless men bent on conquest.  ",

            "answer_text": "Some excellent answers here, but I have one thing to add: Some of the legendary Viking deeds of cruelty probably result from misunderstandings of poetry. Poetry in Old Norse could be extremely hard to follow because of its heavy use of obscure synonyms (heiti) and figures of speech (kenningar). Anyone who's read Beowulf will have seen kennings: \"whale-road\" for the sea, \"ring-breaker\" for a king, and so on. Some forms of Norse poetry use so many kennings that figuring out the poem is like solving the crossword puzzle in the New York Goddammit-Tribune. \"The tree of the storm of shield-serpents\" means a warrior (\"shield-serpent\" = sword; \"storm of shield-serpents\" = \"storm of swords\" = battle; \"tree of the storm of shield-serpents\" = \"tree of battle\" = warrior). Anyway, there's a long poem called Kr\u00e1kum\u00e1l (\"Words of the Raven\"), supposedly recited by Ragnar Lodbrok (yes, that Ragnar Lodbrok) as he is dying from being flung into a pit of venomous snakes by King \u00c6lle of England. He refers to quaffing beer from \"bent trees of the skull\" (bj\u00fagvi\u00f0i hausa). That's a kenning for cattle horns, which grow from the skull and are bent. But when the poem was translated in the 1600s, someone misread the verse and translated it as \"drinking beer from skulls of the slain\". (Warriors are often called \"trees of battle\"; this is probably how \"bent trees\" was read as \"fallen warriors\".) Thus the Vikings got the reputation for using the skulls of their enemies as drinking vessels, which they didn't actually do. The Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok quotes another poem about Ragnar's sons' vengeance on King \u00c6lle. It's hard to understand because of its quirky word order, but it probably means \"Ivar had \u00c6lle's back carved by an eagle\". Which is a poetic way of saying \"Ivar killed \u00c6lle and allowed eagles to scavenge his body.\" That's gross, but it's a very common image in Norse (and Old English) poetry; when you kill enemies, you \"feed the ravens\" or \"feed the wolves\" or \"feed the eagles\", those three species being the Beasts of battle , the usual battlefield scavengers.  But the verse was read \"carved with an eagle\" by the writer of the saga prose, who describes someone taking a knife and carving the picture of an eagle on \u00c6lle's back. That evolved into the \"blood-eagle\" rite, in which, allegedly, Vikings killed people by slicing through the ribs along either side of the backbone and then pulling the lungs out through the gashes. Hideous, gory, and horrifically cruel\u2014and probably not something the real Vikings ever did; it's a misinterpretation of a difficult verse. Even other references to the blood-eagle in sagas like Orkneyinga saga are probably the result of medieval saga-writers misreading old poems. (See Roberta Frank's 1984 article for details: The Rite of the Blood-Eagle .) So: The Vikings could indeed be killers. But at least two of the most infamous blood-soaked atrocities attributed to them are probably misunderstandings of old poetry (which is amazingly easy to misunderstand, and I say this as someone who's attempted to translate it).
