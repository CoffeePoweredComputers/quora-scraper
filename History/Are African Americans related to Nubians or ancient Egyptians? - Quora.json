            "answer_text": "No. The ancestors of black Americans came from these areas of Africa:  Egypt is here, over 6000 miles from those areas:  And Nubia was here:  And this is the Sahara desert, which divides Egypt and Nubia from the areas from which African slaves came:  As you can see Egypt and Nubia are north of the Sahara, along the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the American blacks come from the south of the Sahara from countries along the coast of the Atlantic ocean, completely different places separated from the largest sandy desert in the world. This map can make you understand how big Africa is and how huge the distance between Egypt and the areas from which African American slaves came, also amplified by the fact that to travel that distance you had to cross a huge desert:  The possibility that black Americans have relations with Egypt and Nubia is close to zero, fact also confirmed by those DNA tests that have been so popular in recent years. North African slaves were very rare in the Americas, especially of Egyptian origin, considering that at the time in Egypt there was one of the most flourishing slave markets of the Arab slave trade, which was highly feared and had many victims among Europeans and provided slaves especially to the Muslim world. The Egyptians weren\u2019t sold as slaves, they were the ones who sold slaves. ",

I would say genetically African-Americans are more closely (albeit distantly ancestrally) \u2018related\u2019 to Nigerians, for instance, and to West Africans in general, than they are to Nubians (which are in fact a separate group entirely, with historic Nubia constituting an area that is today split between southern Egypt and Sudan Nubia - Wikipedia). But most black Americans\u2019 African ancestors did not come from that region at all. A few examples, African-American:  African-American:  African-American:  \u2014(below) An actual Egyptian\u2019s results, by contrast (note their Sub-Saharan region matches more so with Sudan and East/NE Africa, rather than West or central):  Egypt:  also Egypt:  Sudanese (Nubia was actually mostly in what is today part of Sudan):  Somali:  Ethiopia:  ",

Also, there are no records.of any sort of contacts between Egypt and Nubia to West Africa before the 12 century A.D. Nubians were the only link of Egypt to subsaharan African. With the exception of Ghana/Mali empires, most of West African remained primitive societies until the European set foot on their shores in the 16th century. At best the could be described as mystery cults that had certain skills in some areas, but nothing that can be described other then tribal pastrolist rather then city states or nation states.  . ",

Egypt and Sudan were part of the Ottoman Empire and were far away from where the Europeans got their slaves. I don\u2019t think they could even take Ottoman subjects and risk war. Egypt was gaining a super power status of its own till the 1840\u2019s. If anything, European slaves were sold in Cairo Egypt till the 1800\u2019s.
