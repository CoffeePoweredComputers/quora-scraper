            "answer_text": "What most Americans do not realize is that the USSR won the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was, effectively, another policy failure by the Kennedy Administration. Not as big a blunder as the Bay of Pigs, but pretty bad. Time, nostalgia, sympathy for an assassinated young, good-looking President, and the splendor of the Kennedy royal family have recast the Missile Crisis into some sort of big win for Kennedy and the US. The crisis was precipitated when the US announced plans to move nuclear missiles into Turkey. Turkey, for those unaware, bordered the southern part of the USSR, specifically near the Caucuses, Russia\u2019s oil-rich region. Not pleased with having NATO missiles on its border (remember, in Europe, NATO missiles were not directly on the Russian border\u2026the USSR had its Eastern European client states as buffers), the USSR basically said \u201cif you can have missiles on our southern border, we will put them on yours\u201d. And they did. And the whole Missile Crisis happened. And the end result? Missiles removed from Cuba AND FROM TURKEY. The USSR got EXACTLY what it wanted\u2026the missiles removed from Turkey. The US got exactly what it didn\u2019t want\u2026the missiles removed from Turkey. All Kennedy did was take us to the point of open warfare. Russia did not \u201cblink\u201d. Kennedy blinked. ",

            "answer_text": "The world did. The Cuban missile crisis was the closest the world ever came to all out nuclear war between the USSR and the USA. On the face of it, it was the USSR who backed down but a lesser known fact is the USA gave in as well. Some months later, so as not to appear related, the USA removed some forward missiles which were located in Turkey. A new hot line was put in which directly links the USA and USSR for greater communication to help prevent such issues from arising again. ",
