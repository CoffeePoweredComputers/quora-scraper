            "answer_text": "The Tsar bomba could have been 100+ mt, but they wisely decided to limit it to 57mt by replacing the uranium in the third stage with lead. There has been no other bomb detonated (or even assembled) that was larger. In theory you could build teller ulam design H bombs of infinite size with multiple stages  But no one has ever made one. There are many disadvantages to a bigger bomb larger mass which means more difficult to deliveragainst large targets like cities, a larger bomb in airburst mode makes less damage (essentially number of square meters of damaged buildings) compared to the same megatonnage split among several smaller warheads properly positioned with adequate separationPrecision guidance means you dont need larger nukes designed to burrow into the ground before detonating to take out buried hard targets like ICBM silos or bunkers. You can use smaller nukes that hit closer to the targetThe larger the explosion, the larger the amount of force that is going to be wasted into the upper atmosphere. A nuclear blast is spherical. Its not going to hug the ground and go around earth\u2019s curvature. Some shockwaves would propagate within the atmosphere only but the blast fireball itself would not and the shockwaves carry only a small amount of the energy. An explosion goes where there is least resistance. If you have a > 10km diameter expanding bubble and the top of the bubble is in very thin air and the bottom is at higher air pressure, the bubble is going to preferentially expand upwards (and we\u2019re ignoring the lighter weight of hotter air).

            "answer_text": "No, not in a single package. But a logically distributed, slightly overlapping, mathematically-calculated pattern of smaller nuclear weapons would be more lethal and far more reliable than one giant bomb. Such a pattern would also destroy a far larger area. Consider: Nuclear weapons are terrifically complex and subject to malfunction. A single weapon could fail to detonate with its intended yield, or not detonate at all. And perhaps more likely, the delivery platform, whether bomber, ICBM, SLBM, or airborne cruise missile, is even less reliable. It can fail to launch, or may malfunction in flight, could possibly be intercepted and shot down, or it may fly far astray of its target. Nuclear targets are always high-value and critical. The targeting staff would need to ensure that every such target were destroyed. That is not done by investing too many scarce resources in one weapon, nor placing all one's eggs in a single basket.
