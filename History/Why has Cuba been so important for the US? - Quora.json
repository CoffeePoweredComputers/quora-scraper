            "answer_text": "Before the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuba was run by Batista and the relationship could be compared to Puerto Rico as of today but with a strong influence of the mob at the time. Even before, it always was a strong place of trade in a very centric location. Then in 1959 Cuba kicked foreign owners out. A process not accepted easily by the US government. It followed more and more the ideologic path of the communism and settled with Russia. It could be seen as the counterpoint to the US presence in Turkey as part of the cold war. Cuba provided the possibility for Russia to get close to the US to demonstrate strength and also acted as a location to spread the influence of communism in the region, while the US tried to get back control several times. Now, after 1989 when the Soviet Union fell the embargo is actually useless. Maybe cold war will be over one day \u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Cuba is not important and the US does not want to own it, it wants to control it just as much as every other country in the world. Well, perhaps a little more since it\u2019s so close and small. But again, Cuba is not important for the US. The US can, and has happily existed and prospered without Cuban goods, Cuban help or Cuban anything. It\u2019s not a critical component of US policy, military strategy, or economy. All the fuss about Cuba in the US comes from the extremely powerful Cuban exile in Florida, which continually influences politicians like Marco Rubio to their side, and the more general dislike bordering on hysterical hate of having a former USSR ally right there almost bordering the mainland. That\u2019s all there is to it. Of course, this must be dressed in the same old \u201cwe love freedom, we love democracy, poor Cuban oppressed people starving while the communist officials stuff their faces and wallets\u201d that the US always uses against its enemies. This is excellent cover to push economic sanctions and hostile actions against the Cuban government that ultimately end up hurting the Cuban people and providing a convenient enemy for said government to focus the people\u2019s frustration on. That\u2019s all there is to it. Cuba is even less important and menacing to the US than North Korea. The US simply cannot suffer a hostile country to live, no matter how small or insignificant. ",
