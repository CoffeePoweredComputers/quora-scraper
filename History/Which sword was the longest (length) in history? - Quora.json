            "answer_text": "The Japanese are renowned for their sword-making, and we know several types of famous Japanese swords. The Japanese forged several other types of weapons, one of which is the \u014ddachi, which means \u201cbig sword\u201d and written as \u5927\u592a\u5200 in kanji.The \u014ddachi, sometimes inappropriately defined as nodachi (written in kanji as \u91ce \u592a \u5200 and translated into \u201cfield sword\u201d) is a type of Japanese sword whose blade could be from 90 to 100 centimeters long, even if you know swords long almost 2 meters. The Norimitsu Odachi was forged by master swordsman Osafune Norimitsu, in 1447, destined for the Shrine of Kibitsu in the prefecture of Okayama.The \u014ddachi was often used on the battlefield during the Nanboku-ch\u014d period, which lasted for much of the fourteenth century, but was certainly built as early as the 5th century AD.  During this period the \u014ddachis often exceeded the meter in length, were used by the infantry against the cavalry, and it is hypothesized to hurt the legs of the horses or to unsaddle the rider.Beyond this historical period, the use of this type of weapon fell into disuse and the main reason being that it was not a very practical sword to use in battles.However, the odachi continued to be used by warriors and its usage only died out in 1615, following the Osaka Natsu no Jin (known also as the Siege of Osaka), during which the Tokugawa Shogunate destroyed the Toyotomi clan. Some historians have even hypothesized that the majority of the \u014ddachi, in reality, were used as ornamental weapons, to be used as a banner to show to the enemies. During the Edo period, 1603-1868, it was certainly used during the ceremonies, and also as an offering to the Gods in the sanctuaries. ",

            "answer_text": "The Norimitsu Odachi is a huge Japanese sword, probably the largest ever forged on Japanese soil. Its dimensions are so impressive that they suggested the imaginative hypothesis that it belonged to a giant. The sword is indeed 3.77 meters long and weighs 14.5 kilograms, practically useless for every feudal Japan Samurai!Apart from the basic knowledge of it having been forged in the 15th century AD, and its size, this impressive sword is shrouded in mystery. The \u014ddachi was often used on the battlefield during the Nanboku-ch\u014d period, which lasted for much of the fourteenth century, but was certainly built as early as the 5th century AD.During this period the \u014ddachis often exceeded the meter in length, were used by the infantry against the cavalry, and it is hypothesized to hurt the legs of the horses or to unsaddle the rider.Beyond this historical period, the use of this type of weapon fell into disuse and the main reason being that it was not a very practical sword to use in battles.  The odachi might have just been carried by hand. During the Muromachi period (which lasted from the 14th till the 16th centuries AD), it was common for a warrior carrying the odachi to have a retainer who would help to draw the weapon for him. It is possible that the odachi was wielded by warriors who fought on horseback as well. It has also been suggested that, as the odachi was a cumbersome weapon to use, it was not actually utilized as a weapon in combat. Instead, it could have been used as a kind of standard for an army, similar to the way a flag would have been employed during a battle. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that the odachi took on a more ritualistic role. During the Edo period, for example, it was popular for the odachi to be used during ceremonies. Apart from that, odachi's were sometimes placed in Shinto shrines as an offering to the gods. The odachi may have also served as a showcase of a swordsmith\u2019s skills, as it was not an easy blade to manufacture. ",
