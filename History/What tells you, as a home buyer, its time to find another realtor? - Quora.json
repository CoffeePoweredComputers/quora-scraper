            "answer_text": "I have some answers for you, but I\u2019d like to offer some perspective about real estate agents first. Real estate sales is a tougher job than most people realize. Agents are obviously paid only when they close a sale or listing, but in the meantime, their expenses continue. Apart from the obvious costs of driving prospective buyers to view houses, they have to spend time (and therefore money) previewing many homes in the area. Most residential real estate agents are members of the National Association of Realtors, the association of Realtors in their state(s), and their local Board of Realtors. They must belong to these organizations in order to call themselves Realtors\u00ae. Each association charges membership dues and fees to belong. They subscribe to the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS). Another fee. Agents must be licensed by their state. There are educational requirements to sit for the salesperson or broker\u2019s exam, and continuing education requirements to renew their license\u2014more fees. The agent who shows a buyer home after home typically drives a very nice car, not only because they want to make a good impression, but also because their car is their office. The automobile expenses are not trivial. Real estate agents have two ways to earn commissions: representing sellers (listings) and representing buyers. They typically earn the same commission regardless of whether they have the listing or the sale, but there is an important difference to be aware of: an agent who represents a seller has a legal contract with the seller. In most cases, the agent will receive his or her commission regardless of who brings the buyer\u2014in fact, most residential sales are accomplished with two cooperating agents\u2014the listing agent and the selling agent. While the agent representing the seller can be reasonably certain that they will get paid (assuming the property is sold during the term of their listing agreement), the buyer\u2019s agent has no such assurance. \u201cBuyers are liars\u201d is an old saying drummed into the heads of new agents. A buyer typically has no legal obligation to the agent who is showing them properties and presenting offers. They can walk into some other agent\u2019s open house one Sunday and decide to write an offer with the listing agent right away. The agent they had been working with won\u2019t get a thing. Agents know that a prospective buyer can decide not to buy at all, even after viewing dozens of homes and possibly writing multiple unsuccessful offers. The agent has no way of recovering the time and money they spent on that buyer. This is why real estate agents strive to be primarily listing agents rather than working with buyers. Some agents don\u2019t work with buyers at all, preferring instead to refer prospective buyers to another agent, receiving a referral fee if an when a sale happens. Does this grim story mean that good agents don\u2019t work with buyers? Of course not; but the best agents are very careful and selective when it comes to the buyers they choose to work with. They won\u2019t show a single property without having first referred the buyer to a lender for preapproval. The best agents spend a great deal of time uncovering the buyer\u2019s needs and capabilities so the properties they show them are most likely to meet their needs and wishes. It is never a random, hit-or-miss operation for a good agent. How do you know whether you should change agents? First, you should ask yourself whether they did their homework ahead of time. When they took you out to view properties, did they seem familiar with them? Could they talk knowledgeably about neighborhoods, schools, community amenities? Did they refer you to a lender for preapproval before showing you properties? If they didn\u2019t, they are almost certainly \u201cflying blind,\u201d since most sellers require a preapproval letter from a lender when they consider a buyer\u2019s offer. You should also ask yourself whether your agent is accessible. Do they answer their phone at reasonable times and respond to messages promptly? Do they answer emails and texts? If they don\u2019t have a ready answer to a question you might ask about a home or neighborhood, do they get the answer back to you promptly? These are all hallmarks of a professional and effective real estate agent. If you are not getting this basic level of service from them, perhaps it is time to look elsewhere. But you should also look at how you are as a client. Have you been forthright in communicating your needs and wants to the agent, or have you changed what you\u2019re looking for often? Are you realistic about the property you want to buy, or are you expecting to get more than the market offers? Real estate agents do have to make decisions about the buyers they work with\u2014and if your expectations are unrealistic, they may conclude that the time they have been spending won\u2019t ultimately be rewarded. The best advice I can offer, speaking as someone who has been in the real estate industry for some four decades (I must have started as a pre-schooler), is that you should evaluate whether your agent is performing at the level I outlined above. You should also determine whether you have been a client that an agent can work with confidently. I hope this is helpful. Good luck! ",

If you don\u2019t feel comfortable or don\u2019t feel like the realtor you\u2019re working with knows what they\u2019re doing or you\u2019re just not feeling it, make a change. This is business, this is also a huge financial decision, this isn\u2019t deciding between what new cell phone to get this is a decision that will impact your short-term financial future. I will often give someone looking for a realtor several different options and tell them to choose the one that they are most comfortable with. I\u2019ve heard of people interviewing many different brokerages to find a realtor they were happy with. If you prefer a female/male, find one that you want to work with. This isn\u2019t a popularity contest and you don\u2019t have to hire your friend or family member who decided to give real estate a shot. ",

She was a family friend we were kind of forced into using but we found a new agent after that. If they are not helpful and just send you automatic listing emails. They should be looking through listings to find what would suit you and making recommendations. This is pretty common unfortunately. If they do not know how to figure the value of the house or make no attempt at anything other than just tell you to offer list price. If they don't know the area you're looking in then find an agent who does. ",
