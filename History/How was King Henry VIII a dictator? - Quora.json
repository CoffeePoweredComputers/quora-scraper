            "answer_text": "Well, let's examine what one means by dictator, shall we? The term dictator comes from a Roman extraordinary magistrate who had absolute authority beyond that which a regular magistrate could wield. They were usually appointed during times of emergency, such as in 217 B.C when the Senate appointed Fabius Maximus as Dictator to deal with Hannibal's invasion. Until really the time of Lucius Cornelius Sulla and Gaius Julius Caesar, the the term was pretty neutral. There were no more dictators in Rome after 44 B.C when Gaius Julius Caesar was assassinated.  The term dictator was revived in the 19th century when Giuseppe Garibaldi was declared Dictator of Sicily, although opponents of Maximilian Robespierre did refer to him as a dictator, albeit clarified with bloodthirsty.  Obviously the modern term has serious connotations of authoritarianism--if not out right totalitarianism--extreme brutality, and personal power. It also has a military bent to it, i.e, military dictators--implying a sort of militaristic control, as well as the dictator existing outside of the law. King Henry VIII was many things. He was not a dictator, however. True, Henry was a proponent of the Divine Rights of Kings and wielded much more personal authority than most English monarchs, but this doesn't make him a dictator. Henry needed Parliament's approval for many things, such as raising an army and navy and often relied on Parliament to fund his extravagant lifestyle. Yes, true Henry was cruel in his destruction of the Monasteries and in some ways that he treated his wives, but he never enacted mass executions and genocide in the manner Cromwell would undertake a century later.  Furthermore, dictators are very different than monarchs. Dictators rely on some sort of mass appeal, whether it be the military or the people. Monarchs do not. ",

            "answer_text": "King Henry the VIII (1491-1547) was a supreme egoist who had in him great thirst for power coupled with a gargantuan appetite for sex. He was extremely stubborn,  intolerant and brooked no opposition whatsoever. The inevitable result: he was a dictator, nay, a brutal dictator. He was a highly imbalanced character for which many paid for, very dearly, with their lives, perhaps, undeservingly. Henry VIII uncle broke the Catholic Church in half and made himself  Head of Church of England, not out of his deep religious beliefs, but out of an intense desire to possess, at any cost, Anne Boleyn who was beheaded by him in 1536.  He married 19 year old Catherine Howard in 1540 and executed her in 1542. He executed his mentor and friend Sir Thomas Moore in 1535. He appeared to be producing babies on women and then killing or abandoning them. He  murdered waves of English citizens. I describe him as a senseless, whimsical, bloody, insensitive king who indulged in indiscriminate killings of persons around or close to him for flimsy or no reasons. He could have been tried like some former Nazis and some politicians for war crimes, crime against humanity, etc. But such a thing would not happen. ",
