            "answer_text": "ibn al-Arabi is a way too common name in the Arabian Peninsula and the Muslim world and there have been quite a few great scholars and saints who have used this name or have become popular with this name. It literally translates into \"son of the Arabian.\" For the purpose of this answer, however, I would assume that you are referring to Shaykh e Akbar Muiyuddin ibn al Arabi (RadhiAllaahuAnhu), a very famous scholar and saint and the most popular person to be known as ibn al Arabi in the non-Muslim world. He is considered an Islamic scholar and a practising Sufi, whatever that term means in common parlance, from the Spanish regions who travelled to the Arabian world to learn and teach. A lot of his work contributes not to the Islamic belief or jurisprudence but to spirituality. His explanation of Wahdat ul Wujood, or the oneness of existence (strictly linguistic translation, neither semantic nor spiritual), became a subject of much debate and continues to be so. His works have been read and admired for centuries by scholars from the Islamic world and have now gained a lot of recognition in the non-Muslim world as well. The most popular ones are Futuhat al Makkiya, or the Meccan Revelations, and Fusus al Hikam, or Bezels of Wisdom. He discusses the concept of the perfect human or Insan al Kamil in Fusus al Hikam which has been widely discussed there onward and is a key subject in understanding philosophy. Another popular book is the Tarjuman al Ashwaq or the Translator of Desires which happens to be a poetry collection. Now to a very important point, most of his books deal with subjects that are highly spiritual in nature and hence should not be read by beginners, especially Muslims. Therefore, I would strongly recommend people not trained in the basics of Islamic belief and jurisprudence to not try and read Islamic spirituality on their own. In the context of Islamic spirituality, ibn al Arabi is a much higher level of discourse and hence care is advised if you plan to read him. ",

            "answer_text": "Mohe\u00efddine Ibn 'Arabi, the Andalusian Muslim, of Arab origin, better known by the single name of Ibn Arabi (born in 1165, in Murcia, in al-Andalus (now Spain) and died in Damascus in Syria. Also called \" Ibn Aflatoon \"(son of Plato) is a theologian, jurist, poet, metaphysics and Arab-Andalusian master of ta\u00e7awuff (sufi) . His work dominates Islamic spirituality since the thirteenth century, and it can be considered the pivot of metaphysical thought in Islam. it is the greatest thinker of the esoteric doctrine of \"Sufi metaphysics\" [that's where he got his aberration]. It has suffered severe criticism and is qualified as an apostate  by the following Islamic scholars : - Al izz ibn abd al salam. -ibn Taymiyyah. -ibn Qayyim. -imam Dhahabi. -ibn al Jawzi. -and many others. - All qualifies him as an apostle,when he made his philosophical approach called \"wahdat al-wujud\",he adopted the philosophical thinking of his predecessor Imam Al-ghazali[also Sufi]. What is \"wahdat al-wujud\"? - According to some Sufis, every living being is embodied in God, so that the existence of the creature is the existence of God. This interpretation leads to a mistaken belief. (If this way of thinking is logic follows that this belief can lead some people to think that the polytheists are actually monotheistic, because although things other than worshiping the One God, they worship only God himself. on the contrary, the existence of God is distinct from His creation. Therefore we can say that worshiping creatures returns indeed to worship something other than God.) God knows best. ",
