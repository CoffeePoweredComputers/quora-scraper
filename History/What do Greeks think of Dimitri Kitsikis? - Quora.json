            "answer_text": "His ideas are for Greek-Turkish federal state. In theory sounds very good. He is basing his argument that such a state would be a super dominant state in the region. What he doesn\u2019t say is how the mistrust between the two countries will be overcomed. Even if the capital of the new state, ley say, moves to\u2026Constantinople or Istanbul? What would the status of Agia Sophia will be? Would the Greeks of Constantinople who were not the subject of the population exchange, will return back to their confiscated property? Even if the language problem is solved, how the electorate system would work? All the above are some of the many issues which are in the core of the dispute between the two countries. One may argue that these issues will be automatically solve in state resembling as the resurrection of the Byzantine Empire. But these are the exact reasons why the Byzantine Empire was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the first place. And are the same reasons why the Ottoman Empire collapsed. So\u2026what will happen when this new formation will collapse? Wouldn\u2019t that lead to more wars between the two? The man is a dreamer not in touch with reality. His ideas run in the sphere of attainable fantasy. ",

            "answer_text": "The vast majority of Greeks do not know who he is. The few that do, say that he proposed the union of Greece and Turkey. Such a union would be impossible to work and be equally beneficial for both nations. No common language, not a common religion, not a common legal system, not a common administrative system. All that such a union would bring are more conflicts. ",
