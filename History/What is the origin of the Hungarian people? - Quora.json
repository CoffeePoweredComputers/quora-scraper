            "answer_text": "In western Siberia , scattered over a very large area, live two closely related people known as the Khant and Mansi peoples . Only about 30,000 exist , and their languages , which belong to the Ugrian branch of the Finno-Ugrian language family , are seriously endangered . They have Mongoloid features with some Caucasoid admixture , and herd reindeer , fish and hunt in their very inhospitable environment . Around 1500 or so years ago, there was a third Ugrian people . for some reason we don\u2019t know with any certainty , they adopted a nomadic lifestyle and began to wander westward for a very long time , and they allied themselves with various Turkic peoples , and learned their steppe nomadic lifestyle . They spent a certain amount of time in various locations around Asia and eastern Europe , but by the end of the 9th century A.D. they entered what is now the nation of Hungary , a region which had been called \u201cPannonia \u201c by the ancient Romans . These were the Magyars . The Magyars conquered the local, mainly Slavic population , but since they were not a large group of people , they were quickly absorbed into the local European population , and only their language remained . But this Finno-Ugrian language , being isolated for so long from its closest relatives in western Siberia , developed on its own , to the point where it bears little resemblance to the Khant and Mansi languages , an even less to languages such as Finnish, Estonian , Saami (Lappish ) which make of the Finno-Ugrian language family &which belong to the Finnic branch of this family . But the similarities in vocabulary etc are still quite clear if you look at comparisons . Hungarian borrowed numerous Turkic loan words, as well as ones from Slavic languages , especially Slovak , German , and other European languages . This explains one of the world\u2019s most curious linguistic anomalies . It\u2019s as though a group Eskimos ( Innuit ) had wandered south from Alaska and Canada and settled in southern California .

            "answer_text": "I will answer this qestion based on the newest genetic and linguistic informations. Linguistically the Hungarians are descedants from Uralic peoples which migrated into Europe from Siberia. Proto-Uralic originated somewhere in a region between the Sayan mountains and Lake Baikal. The proto-Uralic people were a Siberian population and closely related to other Siberians and East Asians. Now some general information about Uralic and proto-Uralic: Here a map of the distribution of modern Uralic languages:  This map shows the migration and the proposed homeland. The small area north of Mongolia is the proposed homeland of proto-Uralic. Linguistic evidence point to strong contact with Mongolic and Turkic but also other Siberian languages. Later they were also in intense contact with Indo-European languages (mostly Slavic and Iranian). Several proposals about a external relationship suggest that they are closely related to various other Siberian (and northern American) languages, such as Yukaghir, Eskimo\u2013Aleut, possibly Nivkh and Chukotko-Kamchatkan. Here the currently most supported theory: Uralo-Siberian:  (It is still not proven and more linguistic analyseses are needed. Nevertheless, genetic studies do support it.) The proto-Uralic people (and so the early ancestors of Hungarians) likely looked like this modern Uralic people:      Various recent genetic studies support the origin of Uralic peoples in Siberia, likely eastern Siberia. The Arrival of Siberian Ancestry Connecting the Eastern Baltic to Uralic Speakers Further East Genes reveal traces of common recent demographic history for most of the Uralic-speaking populations But modern Hungarians are genetically most similar to people around them (which speak Indo-European languages). Thus they do not look like their ancient ancestors or their closest linguistic relatives, the Khanty and Mansi people in Siberia. Recent genetic studies from 2019 and 2020 showed that the early Hungarians had strong East Asian/Siberian genetic components but during their migration (and conquest) to modern Hungary, they absorbed and assimilated many non-Uralic people, thus modern Hungarians are most similar to people around them. \u2192 Modern Hungarians have only little traces of their linguistic ancestors. (A similar case are the Turkish people in Anatolia, which also show only about 15% Turkic genetics.) Now some information about the early Hungarians which arrived in Europe: The early Hungarians were part of the Ugric branch of the Uralic family.  The two other Ugric languages (Khanty and Mansi) are still spoken in Siberia. The migration of early Hungarians into Europe:  Recently, there were several studies about the DNA of early Hungarians: Y-chromosomal connection between Hungarians and geographically distant populations of the Ural Mountain region and West Siberia Genetic analysis of male Hungarian Conquerors: European and Asian paternal lineages of the conquering Hungarian tribes Here the DNA samples of ancient Hungarian conquerors, note that the East Asian lineage N is predominant (37,5%):  We also have C2, a lineage common in modern Mongolians. The rest are various lineages of West-Eurasian origin. We see that the early Hungarians, which brought their language (and culture) to modern Hungary from Siberia, had predominantly the typicall Uralic lineage N, which is today common in Siberia and parts of East Asia:  Over time and already during their migration from Siberia into Europe, they assimilated many non-Hungarian and non-Uralic groups. Conclusion: The ancestors of Hungarians and the Hungarian language were from Siberia, east of the Ural. They were closely related to other Siberian and East Asian populations. Modern Hungarians have predominant local DNA, which means that they assimilated many non-Uralic tribes over the time.
