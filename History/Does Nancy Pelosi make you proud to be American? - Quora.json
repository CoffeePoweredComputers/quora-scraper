            "answer_text": "Let me boil this down so that even you can understand it. There are 435 congressional districts in the United States, residents of which vote for and elect a representative to send to Washington DC. There are another 100 senators, so the legislative branch contains 535 members. Congress consistently ranks in the low double digits in approval ratings yet legislative incumbents are voted back in 90% of the time . This means everybody is saying we don't like who you're sending to Washington but we like our guy. If you don't live within my congressional district it's not your job, your responsibility, or in your interest to tell me who I can or cannot vote for to represent my interests in Washington. Tune out Fox news, they're lying to you. ",
