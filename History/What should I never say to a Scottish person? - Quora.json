            "answer_text": "Hi OA To myself: Don\u2019t tell me England should run Scotland. Don\u2019t call me \u2018British\u2019 or English.. \u2018British\u2019 is synonymous globally with being English so much so it\u2019s the same thing to people outside of these isles. Don\u2019t stereotype all of Scotland as 1960s/70s/80s Glasgow. Sure the poor places are just as rough as there & then.. but in many places you can find yourself going through endless middle class villages. Don\u2019t expect me to care about English affairs, unless they affect Scotland. That Skripals thing is a good example.. its England arguing with Russia, not Scotland arguing with Russia. I\u2019ve had long term Russian friends in the past.. and it seems to me that England just wants to drag everyone into their fight. Don\u2019t tell me because you spend 5 years on holiday in Scotland studying; and your dad the multi-millionaire left Scotland when he was 7yo for England/London; you are \u2018Scottish\u2019. If you were Scottish you would 1. live here. 2. have Scottish children and raise them here. 3. Let said children endure the hardships that the rest of us did.. e.g. interact with other Scottish children (hahaha) (if you are globally Scottish, of Scottish descent, none of that was aimed at you, we get English people of Scottish descent come back up here and flash their cash they got in London, which is a huge cultural no-no and they know it and don\u2019t care! and do it anyway!.. it\u2019s like when Americans go to Canada, and they are *really* not supposed to talk money to Canadians.. but they do it anyway. My ex who was American did that when we were in Canada.. wow! no! The guy smiled at me and drew growlers at her) Don\u2019t talk to me about how rich you are; or how cheap Scotland is (this is another comparison with Canada). English people do this often, brag about their money and say how cheap Scotland is, like its a compliment, when really it\u2019s a veiled insult. I provided some \u2018touchy\u2019 answers, but it was a \u2018touchy\u2019 question to begin with, I hope the OA gets something out of my answers. ",
