            "answer_text": "Same reason we read Shakespeare: because they reach the core of the deep questions of existence. Imagine the scene when Oedipus realizes the prophecy has come true, that he\u2019s killed his father and slept with his mother: his mother lies dead, having killed herself, and he takes the clasp that binds her gown and drives them into his eyes so the last image he sees is that of his naked, dead, mother-wife. The same idea is in the Bible and other ancient writings: they\u2019d kill a king\u2019s children in front of him and then blind him so that would be his last visual memory. Every great Greek work has moments this deep. The ultimate for me is when Achilles confronts himself - and kills himself - at the end of the Iliad, but that would take a few pages to discuss in depth. Here\u2019s a simpler example: Prince Hal thinks his father is dead and picks up the crown and wrestles with it, with the idea of being king, with the responsibility that comes with it. Compare the Greek play in which Dionysus makes the women crazy. Their leader kills a wild beast and cuts off its head, only to have the God remove the delusion so she discovers its her own son\u2019s head in her lap. Anguish. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me give you an example. Last year Turkey\u2019s President, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, overcame a violent military coup. He may or may not have been forewarned about this and the coup may or may not have been backed by \u201cforeign secret services\u201d; yet the fact remains that he is currently using the coup as an excuse to purge the country from every dissident he can get his hands on. From military personnel and diplomats to journalists and academics they are either fired or jailed awaiting trial - with the imminent return of the death penalty looming over them. And here is where it gets eerie: Erdo\u011fan went on to order all the supporters of the coup who were killed in the process not to receive proper burials. The mayor of Constantinople dully obliged to this - but will everyone obey such an order, including the families of the deceased and the most devout members of the clergy? Now, let\u2019s go back 2,500 years, to 5th century BC Athens when the dramatic writer Sophocles first presented his classic theatrical play Antigone. It is a story with quite a long background but it boils down to this: the king of Thebes, Creon, in a moment of prideful hubris, he too ordered the leader of the faction opposing him in the civil war, Polyneices, to remain unburied in order to shame him. Yet, Polyneices\u2019 sister, Antigone, when faced with the dilemma of her morality conflicting with legality, she decides to defy the king\u2019s orders and honor her brother with a proper burial, knowing full well that she will get caught and punished by death. When later she is brought before the king she declares the moral law that all humans contain within our psyche to far surpass any law set by mortal rulers. The king\u2019s nemesis (moral turmoil) ensues and he does repent and change course in the end - but not before he suffers the inevitable catharsis (cleansing) that removes the hubris and restores the moral balance. Because, once she makes her difficult choice, Antigone\u2019s path is unwavering. The truly tragic figure is Creon, getting entangled in his inflated pride and wanting to dispense justice as he saw fit - only to destroy everything and loose everyone in the process.   Why do we study Greek literature, you ask? Because, even if only a fraction of it was saved intact throughout the centuries, there is not a single aspect of the human condition not described and resolved within it. From unearthing the influences of deep Oedipal complexes to warning about the corruption of power and from describing the perils of human pathos to reproducing every hue of our common emotions, the epic sagas, the lyric poems, the plays, and the novels covered it all. Since its premiere, in the summer of 441 BC, Antigone has been performed, or rather, taught, (to employ the correct classical Greek expression) innumerous times over the next twenty five centuries. The first picture is from a classic iteration of the play with the legendary Greek actress of the 1960\u2019s, Irene Papas, whereas the second one is from a modern interpretation by the US National Theater with Jodie Whittaker, some years ago.
