            "answer_text": "Portugal was the kindest, the less racist and the one that invested more in the colonies than in its own country! The Most Devastating Atrocities Committed By Every European Colonial Empire European colonialism changed the world in countless ways, but the most blatantly apparent will always be the loss of life and bloodshed that occurred in the name of expansion and progress. Western imperialism, motivated by the desire to find resources, make money, save the \"uncivilized,\" and garner prestige, ultimately brought about death, hardship, and violence for those who received it. The effects of colonialism - everything from genocide to resource exploitation to loss of cultural identity - are still felt today, while many of the lessons of colonialism seem to remain unlearned. Keep in mind, these are only some of the worst events and policies European imperialism had to offer. The horror, tragedy, and pain that was the Atlantic Slave Trade, well, that's a story for another list.  The Belgian Congo, 1885-1908 King Leopold II of Belgium (1835-1909) took over a large part of central Africa in 1885, claiming that he would bring civility and progress to his newly acquired Congo Free State. King Leopold did the opposite, however, exploiting the land and the people for ivory, rubber, and timber. King Leopold wanted to prove to the world that his small country could compete with the other European powers. Rubber was particularly prosperous for Leopold, who had personal control of most of the Congo until 1908. During the late 1880s and early 1890s, the increased production of bicycles and automobiles led to a growing need for rubber that Leopold happily met. He did this with forced labor, placing Africans under the authority of a rubber agent who sent them to the forest with quotas while holding their wives and children hostage. When the Africans did not meet the quota, they were severely punished - usually flogged - and as the demand for rubber continued to go up, men had to venture further and further into the forest to find mature rubber vines. Belgians also used forced labor to cut timber and build roads. Men worked themselves to death, their families starved, and many Africans fled to the forests as an act of rebellion. Leopold's men, part of a private military force called Force Publique (FP), would simply go after them, either killing them or cutting off their hands or genitals to make an example of them and motivate through fear. The Belgian soldiers were told not to waste bullets and were expected to bring back one hand for every bullet they fired. After one village rebelled, one FP officer recalled: \"the commanding officer ordered us to cut off the heads of the men and hang them on the village palisades, also their sexual members, and to hang the women and the children on the palisade in the form of a cross.\" When a soldier couldn't produce a hand, he would buy one or trade for one - or he would cut one off of a living person to turn into his superior. Entire villages were killed, women were assaulted while their husbands harvested rubber, and once outsiders began to get an idea of what was going on, they appealed to Leopold to stop. When George Washington William visited the Congo in 1890, he wrote a letter to Leopold questioning why there was no \"civilizing\" going on - meaning Christianity - and leveling charges against him of brutality. He described how the Belgians were \"excessively cruel to its prisoners, condemning them, for the slightest offenses, to the chain gang, the like of which can not be seen in any other Government in the civilized or uncivilized world. Often these ox-chains eat into the necks of the prisoners and produce sores about which the flies circle, aggravating the running wound; so the prisoner is constantly worried. These poor creatures are frequently beaten with a dried piece of hippopotamus skin, called a \u201cchicote\u201d, and usually the blood flows at every stroke when well laid on. But the cruelties visited upon soldiers and workmen are not to be compared with the sufferings of the poor natives who, upon the slightest pretext, are thrust into the wretched prisons here in the Upper River.\" International outrage over the conditions in the Congo Free State led to the Belgian government taking over control of the colony, and renaming it the Belgian Congo in 1908. Leopold was said to have made between $100 and $500 million during his run as head of the Congo Free State but as many as 10 million Africans were killed in the process.  British India And The Famines, 1865-1943 To be clear, there were numerous famines in India (which then included modern-day Bangladesh and Pakistan) during the time the British East India Company and the British government controlled the sub-continent. The role of the British in the famines is debated among historians, but it is generally accepted that the policies, practices, and reactions by the British during each of the famines increased their death rates. When famine struck Orissa in 1865, the British administration chose to ignore it until the British troops themselves began to starve. In 1866, the British began sending rice and other resources into India, but it was too late for many. One third of the population of Orissa died as a result. The same type of attitude toward famine also characterized British reactions to the famine of 1876-1878 in Madras when four to five million Indians perished. The British continued to export foods to other parts of the Empire but neglected to respond to the needs of India during the famines of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The famine of 1943 has gained more international attention than the others as of late; during World War Two, the British: \"exported more than 70,000 tonnes of rice between January and July 1943,\" enough food to keep almost half a million people alive. Conditions were so bad that \"parents dumped their starving children into rivers and wells. Many took their lives by throwing themselves in front of trains. Starving people begged for the starchy water in which rice had been boiled. Children ate leaves and vines, yam stems and grass.\" The death toll from the Bengal famine of 1943 was as many as between 1.5 and 3.5 million people. Photo: Unknown/WikiMedia Commons/Public Domain Spain, The Aztecs, And Tenochtitlan, 1519-1521 The Aztec Empire, based in Tenochtitlan and controlling most of modern-day Mexico, made contact with Spanish conquistadors during the first decades of the 16th century; however, when Hernan Cort\u00e9s arrived in 1519, it quickly descended into war. Montezuma II, the leader of the Aztec empire, sent treasures to Cort\u00e9s after he heard about the Spaniard's landing, hoping they would go back to Cuba (Spain already controlled the island, with the help of Cort\u00e9s). Cort\u00e9s put the treasures on a ship to Spain, and burned the other ships to give his men no other choice but to march to Tenochtitlan. Before getting to the Aztec capital, Cort\u00e9s earned the backing of rivals to Montezuma, including 3,000 Tlaxcalteca men who urged him to conquer the city of Cholula. Cort\u00e9s destroyed the city, burning it to the ground, and according to his letters: \"in three hours time his troops killed 3,000 people and burned the city. Another witness, Vazquez de Tapia, claimed the death toll was as high as 30,000.\" Cort\u00e9s continued on to Tenochtitlan where he came face to face with Montezuma on Novermber 9, 1519. He was received with gifts and fanfare but Montezuma and his people were fearful of the Spaniards, especially after having heard about the massacre at Cholula. They housed the Spanish, including Cort\u00e9s, who many believed to be the god Quetzalcoatl. Cort\u00e9s turned on his host a week later, seizing Montezuma on the 16th of November, forcing him to publicly submit to the King of Spain. Cort\u00e9s managed to make Montezuma look weak and the Aztec nobility overthrew him, rebelling against their leader and the Spanish presence alike. During several battles, the Aztec and the Spanish traded control of Tenochtitlan, with the Spanish finally taking it as theirs in August of 1521. By that point, the Spanish had starved the Aztec population, and also transmitted smallpox, wiping out a large portion of the population. According to sources: \"On the day that Tenochtitl\u00e1n was taken, the Spaniards committed some of the most brutal acts ever inflicted upon the unfortunate people of this land. The cries of the helpless women and children were heart-rending. The Tlaxcalans and other enemies of the Aztecs revenged themselves pitilessly for old offences and robbed them of everything they could find. Only Prince Ixtilxochitl of Texcoco, an ally of Cort\u00e9s, felt compassion for the Aztecs, because they were of his own homeland. He kept his followers from maltreating the women and children as cruelly as Cort\u00e9s and the Spaniards did... The anguish and bewilderment of our enemies was pitiful to behold. The warriors gathered on the rooftops and stared at the ruins of their city in a dazed silence, and the women and children and old men were all weeping...\" Over the next few decades, the Spanish built \"New Spain\" on the remnants of Tenochtitlan and the Aztec empire, eradicating the people and society entirely. By 1568, only 3 million people of the original 30 million who made up the Aztec population in 1518 remained. The monstrous amount of deaths were caused by fighting and starvation and, in large part, by disease. Photo: Unknown/Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain Boer Concentration Camps, 1900-1902 The British Empire fought two Boer Wars in South Africa, the first during the 1870s and 1880s, and the second between 1899 and 1902. During the Second Boer War, also known as the South African War, British forces rounded up Boers - individuals of Dutch and African descent - and placed them in concentration camps. Who were the Boers? The Boers, which was the Dutch and Afrikaans word for \"farmer,\" inhabited the republics of Transvaal and the Orange Free State, just to the north of British controlled South Africa. When Transvaal and the Orange Free State established an alliance in 1897, the British feared that the Boers would attempt to take over all of South Africa. To keep that from happening, the British placed troops on the border between the Boer republics and British South Africa. The Boers issued an ultimatum for the British to remove their troops in 1899; the British refused, and war broke out in October of 1899. The first six months of the war were successful for the Boers but the British had the upper hand in terms of weapons and manpower. Half a million British troops were more than a match for the almost 90,000 Boer forces. By 1900, the British had control of both Boer republic capitals and annexed the territory. The war went on until early 1902, thanks to a resurgence of Boer action, but the Boers were forced to give into British rule with the Peace of Vereeniging. Military exchanges during the South African War saw 100,000 British and 14,000 Boer deaths. The larger death toll of the war, however, resulted from the concentration camps established by the British. The British rounded up men, women, and children from the South African countryside, in large part to try to quell guerrilla warfare, and placed them in camps in both Boer republics. By September 1901, there were 34 camps holding roughly 110,000 white Boers. Conditions in the camps were brutal, as one visitor described: \"the exile camp here is a good two miles from the town, dumped down on the southern slope of a kopje (a small, rocky hill), right out in the bare brown veld, not a vestige of a tree in any direction, nor shade of any description.\" In some camps, death rates reached 2,000 to 3,000 per month and, by the end of the war, almost 27,000 men, women, and children had died as a result of their treatment. This constituted 15% of the total Boer population in both republics. There were camps for blacks as well, although they didn't garner the outrage those for whites did. Between 14,000 and 20,000 black individuals died in the British camps. Mau Mau Uprising, 1952-1960 In British-controlled Kenya during the 1930s and 1940s, the native Kikuyu tribe continued to lose land and agricultural rights. While the tribe remained loyal to the British government, resistance movements within Kenya grew up and a secret society, known as the Mau Mau, began carrying out attacks on the British by 1952. The Mau Mau were banned but continued to gather followers, causing chaos and committing acts of violence that led to the British declaring a state of emergency in 1952. The Mau Mau included notable nationalists like Jomo Kenyatta, the future president of Kenya, but after the state of emergency was declared, many members of the group were detained. This only caused the Mau Mau to escalate their acts of violence on Brits and Kikuyu natives alike. The British sent more and more troops to Kenya but over the next eight years Mau Mau attacks continued. The British began carrying out sweeps, rounding up both suspected and actual members of the Mau Mau, and implemented \"collective punishment\" on villages that were believed to be harboring Mau Mau or were sympathetic to the group. Thousands of Kikuyu and suspected Mau Mau were gathered up and sent to reservations or camps, where \"abuse and torture was commonplace... as British guards used beatings, sexual abuse, and executions to extract information from prisoners and to force them to renounce their allegiance to the anti-colonial cause.\" The number of Mau Mau killed during this period is debated, with official numbers of \"11,000, including 1,090 convicts hanged by the British administration. Just 32 white settlers were killed in the eight years of emergency.\" According to the Kenyan Humans Rights Commission, however: \"90,000 Kenyans were executed, tortured or maimed during the crackdown, and 160,000 were detained in appalling conditions.\" Spain And The Incas, 1532-1572 When the Spanish conquistadores Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro arrived in modern-day Peru in 1531, they found a civilization in crisis. The Inca were on the heels of a civil war between two rivals for control of the empire: Waskar and Atahualpa. Atahualpa was victorious but internal strife remained problematic for him and his people. In addition to the fight for leadership, there were smaller tribes within the Inca empire that resented being under Inca rule. Pizarro, backed by his 80,000 men, met Atahualpa in November 1532 in a peaceful exchange but both men were determined to kill the other upon their next meeting. The next day, Pizarro attacked the Inca, killing 7,000 men and taking Atahualpa hostage. The Spanish very literally out-gunned the Inca forces, who were armed with spears and arrows and experienced no losses in the battle. It's unclear if Atahualpa attempted to ransom himself or if the Spanish offered to let him go in exchange for riches, but over the course of the next eight months, the Inca gathered up silver, gold, jewels, and other valuable items to placate their oppressors. The Spanish gladly accepted all of the rewards but executed Atahualpa during the summer months of 1533. He was sentenced to be burned at the stake but, after he and the Inca agreed to convert to Christianity, he was garroted. After Atahualpa was killed, the Inca were left without a leader and even more vulnerable to Spanish conquest. Over the following four decades, the Spanish systematically conquered every Inca city and stronghold and, in spite of the continued guerrilla warfare carried on by natives, took complete control of the Empire in 1572. Overall, the Spanish presence in the New World brought death by smallpox and other epidemic diseases, as well as by military action, especially as the Inca continued to rebel against them. It's estimated that the Spanish killed 50-90% of the population in the Andes mountain region of South America during this period during the late 15th and 16th centuries. The British And Australian Aboriginal Massacres, 1790s-1890s Settlers from both the Netherlands and Britain landed in Australia during the late 17th and early 18th centuries but only the British stayed and decided to colonize the island. British ships arrived at New South Wales in 1788 to set up a colony and, at first, were on reasonable terms with the native Aboriginal population. As the lives of Aborigines began to become more and more disrupted by the presence of Europeans, resistance movements emerged. Britain, however, continue to use New South Wales as a penal colony, sending shipments of criminals to the outliers of the Empire, essentially to get rid of them. Between 1788 and 1823, most of the British that arrived in Australia were prisoners or mariners, although free settlers began to enter in 1793. During the 1810s, 1820s, and 1830s, there were several massacres of Aboriginal groups by British troops in the New South Wales region. At Appin in 1816, for example, 14 Aborigines were killed after they ventured onto British lands looking for food. In 1838, a particularly difficult year, between 50 and 100 unarmed Australian natives were slaughtered at the Waterloo Creek massacre and the Myall Creek massacre of the Kamilaroi people. As the British slowly began to explore and seize more of the island, there were more massacres of Aboriginal groups as they came into contact with them. In Victoria, between 60 and 200 Aborigines were killed at Portland in 1833 and 1834. In Gippsland, there were 2000 Kurnai in 1840 but by \"1853 there were 131, and by 1857 only 96. Though no one suggests all died violently, hundreds probably did.\" In Western Australia in the 1830s, punitive raids were carried out against Aborigines believed to be chicken thieves because \"daring and hostile conduct of the natives induced me [Captain Irwin] to seize the opportunity to make them sensible to our superiority, by showing how severely we could retaliate their aggression.\" The exact number of massacres and killings that took place by the British against Australian Aborigines is unknown but has been estimated to be in the hundreds. Not all of these deaths were caused by violence, however. Disease was common and, because there was no resistance among indigenous groups, many succumbed to illness. When the British first arrived in Australia, there were 750,000 Aboriginals in Australia. By 1920, that number had declined by 90%. In addition to the number of Aboriginal deaths, native Australians were removed from their lands and sent to live on plantations. They experienced harsh conditions and lacked any autonomy. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it became British policy for Aboriginal children to be taken under the protection of Europeans and thousands of young natives were removed from their homes. These children, about 10-30% of Aboriginal youths in total, were given educations based in European teachings, their names were changed, and they were encouraged - if not forced - to reject their native languages and traditions.  French Algeria, 1954-1962 As the French were losing hold of their colonial possessions around the world, they tightened their grip on Algeria. Algeria was brought under French control in 1830 (after Ottoman rule failed) and numerous French settlers, called pieds noirs, made their way to the north African territory. After 1848, the French considered Algeria to be a part of France and, with settlers confiscating land, many peasants and farmers were forced into marginal lands. Starvation, disease, and early resistance killed about one-third of the native Algerian population by the 1870s. Resistance against the French in Algeria ebbed and flowed, but the large number of European settlers contributed to social tensions and the development of an insurgency movement during the early 20th century. In 1945, a series of peaceful demonstrations broke out in Algeria - celebrating a victory in the war over Germany as well as calling for autonomy - and were met with violence by the French. At Setif and Guelma in May 1945, French forces opened fire on protestors and continued to carry out repressive actions over the next several days. Numbers vary but \"according to the Algerian state left 45,000 people dead. European historians put the figure at between 15,000 and 20,000.\" In Algeria, anti-colonial resistance eventually led to war between the natives and the French colonists. In 1954, the various groups that wanted the French out of Algeria joined together to form the Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale (FLN) and, with the Arm\u00e9e de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale (ALN), fought a war for independence until 1962. During the Algerian War for Independence, the French bombed Algeria and conducted ratissages (the \u201craking over\u201d of towns and villages through bombing, arrests, and torture). The types of torture used included burning, electrocution, water torture, and beatings. According to one former French general, Paul Aussaresses: \u201cOnly rarely were the prisoners we questioned during the night still alive the next morning... whether they had talked or not they had generally been neutralized.\" Estimates for the numbers of Algerians killed during the war vary from 90,000 to 1.5 million. Photo: Auguste Raffet /Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain French Haiti, 1790s-1804 In Haiti, slaves banded together with gens de couleur - free people of color - during the late 18th century to fight against French colonial rule. Slave insurrections and attacks on plantations by maroons - slaves that had fled and were living in hiding - killed hundreds of French settlers from 1791 forward, leading to a violent and oppressive response by the French military. In August 1791 alone, French troops committed numerous atrocities, killing \"six blacks who were chained up in the hospital and two Negresses who were completely blameless,\" as well as the \"50 Negroes... shot in trenches prepared in the town cemetery,\" and the \"20 black brigands who had been captured... put on a boat and drowned in the sea.\" By the end of 1791, Toussaint Louverture had emerged as the leader of the rebel army and the French were forced to abolish slavery in the colonies in 1794. Louverture was nominally allied with the French but continued to work for his own government and his own rule in Haiti. When Napoleon Bonaparte sent French troops back to Haiti in order to restore the old order in 1801, war broke out again. The fighting between the two sides was even more brutal. Blacks murdered settlers and any whites they could find: \"the French fitted out a ship as a mass extermination machine: blacks were driven down into the hold and asphyxiated by noxious fumes. The name of the vessel: The Stifler.\" Haiti was proclaimed an independent state on January 1, 1804. The slave revolt had achieved its goal but, on the whole, the Haitian slave revolt resulted in 400,000 deaths. Most of these were slaves and other Haitians. For his part, Louverture was arrested in 1802 and sent to France where he died the following year, never knowing that the revolt he'd been so much a part of had ultimately been successful.  German Namibia And The Herero Genocide, 1904-1907 Germany's imperial possessions in Africa included modern day Namibia, which was then called South West Africa. In the aftermath of the Berlin Conference of 1884 and 1885 (which divvied up Africa to European countries), Germany took possession of Namibia, negotiated its borders with the neighboring Portuguese-controlled Angola, and arranged for access to the Zambezi River with Britain in the east. By 1890, German began confiscating land and cattle from the native Herero and Nama populations. There were rebellions against German rule during the 1890s and early 1900s as well as skirmishes between German troops and local tribes in 1903. One Nama chief was shot in a dispute over a goat and when Herero groups refused to move to reservations, both sides began to move toward war. In early 1904, 100 Germans were killed by African forces, who outnumbered the Europeans initially, but by August, the Germans had the upper hand. Over the subsequent two years, Germany moved the Herero and Nama tribes to reservations and camps. Many of the \"prisoners of war\" from the camps \"were used as slave labour to build railways, docks and buildings throughout the country.\" Germany issued extermination orders, articulated by colonial governor, Lieutenant General Lothar von Trotha. The order stated: \"The Herero people will have to leave the country. If the people refuse I will force them with cannons to do so. Within the German boundaries, every Herero, with or without firearms, with or without cattle, will be shot. I won\u2019t accommodate women and children anymore. I shall drive them back to their people or I shall give the order to shoot at them.\" The war between Germany and the Nama carried on until 1907, by which time \"65,000-80,000 Herero lives and around 10,000 Nama lives had been lost.\" This constituted about 80% of their total populations. Dutch East Indies, 1945-1949 The Dutch East Indies, which included islands such as Sumatra, Java, and parts of Borneo, were initially part of the Dutch trading empire of the 17th century. The Dutch established the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC) or Dutch East India Trading Company in 1602 with the intent of controlling the spice trade in the region between the Indian and Pacific oceans. Their major competitors were the British (who established their own trading company, the British East India Company, in 1600) and the Portuguese (who were already in decline by the late 16th century.) The VOC established its trading headquarters in the East Indies at Batavia (Jakarta) in 1619 and continued to control trade in the region until the company went broke in 1799. The Dutch government then took over, renaming the islands the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch held onto the East Indies through the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries until they were occupied by Japan during World War Two. After the war ended, the Dutch East Indies rejected the notion of going back under Dutch control and launched a war for independence. In 1945, the Dutch East Indies, soon to be known as Indonesia, declared its independence. Neither the Dutch nor the other Allied powers recognized the claim and troops were sent in to bring Indonesia back under European control. Battles between 1945 and 1946 demonstrated the strength of the Indonesian military and devotion to the cause and, as a result, there were several attempts at peace. The government of the newly independent Indonesia struggled to find its footing but were still able to hold off Dutch advances after peace failed in 1947. When the Dutch fought to control Sulawesi in 1946 and 1947, they killed an estimated 4,000 Indonesians in two months. Led by Captain Raymond Westerling, who used what would become known as the \"Westerling method,\" the \"Dutch commandos would surround a village during pre-dawn hours, searching the residents and their homes. Anyone found with a weapon was shot on the spot and his house burned. The rest were herded into an open field, the men separated from the women and children. Any suspected 'terrorists' were brought forward, 'condemned' and summarily executed.\" Dutch \"police action\" began in 1947 and brought about the most brutal reprisals of the war. During two major police actions, the Dutch used 120,000 troops to bring \"peace and order\" to Indonesia. Former soldiers have admitted that they \"didn't shoot them [Indonesians], but I tortured them and I beat them up. I put them in the sun till they fell down. I was never told to do it - you just grow into it. Isn't it terrible? They didn't tell me to torture people, that was my own doing. I wanted to do my job well.\" Indonesia became an independent state in 1949 but it's difficult to know exactly how many people died in the process. The Dutch suffered \"6000 deaths as a direct result of war. Indonesian casualties are almost impossible to calculate... 45,000 \u2013 100,000 Indonesian military and 25,000 \u2013 100,000 Indonesian civilians were killed, and seven million Indonesians displaced.\"  Irish Potato Famine, 1846-1852 The Irish Potato Famine of the mid-19th century led to as much as 25% of the Irish population dying from starvation or disease - roughly 1 million people. Another 1 million people were forced to flee or were evicted from Ireland. This famine, much like those in India, was not the British Empire's fault in terms of cause, but it was more deadly than it should have been because of British policies and reaction. Ireland at this time was under the authority of the British Empire and when the potato blight first appeared in 1845, England did very little to help the situation. The potato was the staple crop of Ireland. The crop failures of the 1840s, now known to have been caused by a plant pathogen, deprived the Irish of food, fodder for cattle, and an export commodity. Queen Victoria repealed the corn and grain laws that made food other than potatoes costly in Ireland, and began transporting grain and corn to the country, but most people couldn't afford it, there wasn't enough, and many didn't know how to cook the new crops. Due to poverty, landlords began evicting people who were then forced to seek refuge in the charity-houses and workhouses that had been set up throughout the country. Exports out of Ireland continued in large amounts during the famine, feeding populations around the world at the expense of Irishmen and women. The British government also suspended aid programs like soup kitchens, adopting a laissez-faire attitude and waited for the economic and social strife to correct itself. Amritsar Massacre, 1919 The British Empire asserted direct rule in India with the establishment of the Raj in 1858. Over the course of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, England placed a governor-general, or viceroy, in Calcutta, and controlled the administration of India from London. England continued to have Indians serve in lower civil service positions but the growth of Indian nationalism (and the expense of running the empire) contributed to the growth of self-governance after World War One. In the aftermath of World War One, Indian calls for independence became louder and, at times, violent. Indians contributed men and resources to the British in the war but found themselves without a voice. Nationalist protests began to spring up and the British started banning public gatherings. On April 13, 1919, at the town of Amritsar, thousands of people attended a Sikh religious festival, unaware of the order against public assembly. The religious festival coincided with a nationalist protest in Amritsar where British troops had gathered. In an unprovoked act, British soldiers opened fire on the unarmed Indians, killing hundreds of people and injuring over a thousand. According to accounts of the massacre at Amritsar, British Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer and 90 of his men (all Indian) fired their guns for 10 minutes into the crowd of Indian protesters and festival-goers, using all of their ammunition, about 1650 rounds. The official death toll was 379 people. ",
