            "answer_text": "I'd have to go with Fokker D.VII as being the better warplane.  It depends on how you define \"most powerful\": on paper the Camel and D.VII are more or less identical except for three important characteristics where the D.VII had a significant edge: speed (200 kph versus 182 kph)rate of climb (9.52 meters/second versus 5.5 meters/second)power (130 kW versus 97 kW).These characteristics translate into a big advantage in aerial combat: better ability to engage and disengage in combat at will. But it's not really a fair comparison. The D.VII was designed in late 1917. The Camel was designed in late 1916. That's eons in the breakneck pace of aeronautical evolution in World War I. The Sopwith Camel was obsolescent by the time the D.VII became operational. The Camel was more of an incremental design based on earlier Sopwith designs using established wood construction. The D.VII used a metal frame fuselage. The Camel used a rotary engine, an evolutionary dead end in aircraft engines. The D.VII had a in-line 6 cylinder engine that presaged the V-12 engines of World War II. The Camel's design emphasized maneuverability, resulting in an aircraft that was difficult to fly, and especially land, largely due to its rotary engine. The D.VII was far more forgiving and sturdy, if not as maneuverable as the Camel. The D.VII was a harbinger of the future of aerial combat, from its metal construction to its powerplant and its design preference for hit and run tactics over dogfighting performance. One final measure of the Fokker D.VII's superiority: the initial armistices terms proposed by the Allies stipulated that Germany turn over all D.VIIs. Though it didn't make into the Treaty of Versailles, the Allies did seize hundreds of D.VIIs for their own post-war evaluation and use. ",

            "answer_text": "The Sopwith Camel was never a particularly powerful aircraft. The standard Clerget rotary engine only gave 130hp, at a time when the best inline engines gave 150 to 160hp. Even the rarer Bentley Br.1 only gave 150hp when installed in a Camel. The Camel\u2019s successor the Sopwith Snipe had 230hp Bentely Br.2. The D.VII was originally fitted with Mercedes engine which gave 160hp (later upgraded to 175hp) and the later BMW engine gave 185hp. It was faster and had a better rate of climb than the Camel. Where the Camel always excelled was in manouverability. Unfortunately this came at the price of being unstable in flight. So while the Camel was the most successful Allied aircraft of WW1, in terms of enemy aircraft destoyed, it was also one of the most dangerous with at least as many pilots killed in flying accidents, especially in training, as were shot down. By the summer of 1918 the Camel had mostly been relegated to infantry support duties, leaving the air to air role to inline engined aircraft with 200hp engines (such as the Se.5a, Spad XIII and Sopwith Dolphin). The D.VII was not as manouverable as the Camel but it was easier to fly and it was a formidable opponent to the Allies. So much so that there was a specific clause in the Versailles Treaty that all D.VII aircraft had to be surrendered to the Allies. ",
