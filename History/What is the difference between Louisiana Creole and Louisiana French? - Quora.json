            "answer_text": "I take it you mean linguistically. (If you don't, see Ang\u00e8le d'Esplechin's answer to What is the difference between Cajun and Creole?) To a non-French speaker, the two languages usually sound the same. The accents and cadence do not noticeably differ. This makes it difficult for Standard French speakers to understand Louisiana Creole, but allows Louisiana French speakers to pick it up fairly easily. Grammatically, however, the two are quite distinct. LC has a subject-verb-object word order; LF tends toward subject-object-verb. There is no counterpart to suis/est. To joli, therefore, is t'es joli. They each have a different set of pronouns. In LC, we say \u201cMo,\u201d while in LF we say \u201cJe.\u201d To is tu/ti/. Y\u00e9 is ils/eux-autres. Nouzot and nous-autres, and vouzot and vous-autres, however, sound the same. They are spelled differently because\u2026 The two languages have different orthography. LC has a unique orthography that is completely phonetic and uses way more diacritics than LF. LF uses regular French orthography (because, for all its quirks, it is still French). The tenses are different, with LC inserting markers like t\u00e9 and s\u00e9 before the verb; LF conjugates more or less normally to Standard French. Demonstratives are different. Also, in older varieties of Cr\u00e9ole, the difference between feminine and masculine words is ignored, with everything using a masculine article. This is an old feature, and I believe has been replaced by the French use of masculine/feminine diff\u00e9rentiation. Some words are different. Gain is avoir. Some words sound the same, but mean something different. Kouri, for example, means to go, not to run, as courir does. This video explains differences as well:  Here is a page that explains LC grammar alongside English: http://louisianacreoledictionary.com/Lesson%20Topics/Grammar.aspx ",
