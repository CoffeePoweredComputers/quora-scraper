Summerhill is referenced in numerous publications and reports about student voice and school councils as one of the oldest and most influential examples of children taking part in democratic decision-making in their school.

It is referenced in Invention of Childhood in episode 27 (9 minutes into the programme),  BBC Radio 4 Extra - The Invention of Childhood, A Prison or a Guardian  It has an ongoing influence on the perception of schools, children and childhood as demonstrated by the Children's BBC drama series 'Summerhill', whose director said he wanted to challenge people's ideas of school.

            "answer_text": "Summerhill is mentioned frequently in university subjects such as Politics and is known around the world by both teachers and students.Thanks to the books published about Summerhill being translated into different languages, its idea is easily spread to countries like Japan and Taiwan, although there are cultural conflicts with the idea of allowing children the freedom to choose whether or not to go to lessons because it is quite different to the way education has been in the world in history.There are a number of school all around the world that are trying to adapt to the self-governing way of Summerhill, this is helping further to spread the idea of an alternative way to education. It is agreeable that the idea is spreading more slowly than it could be, but it is definitely happening be it slowly or quickly. ",
