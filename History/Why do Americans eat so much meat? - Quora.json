            "answer_text": "To augment other answers, the raising of animals for meat is heavily subsidized. Keep in mind that price control, as opposed to full employment, has consistently been the driving force behind US economic and monetary policy for decades. Inflation is watched by hawks, energy costs are subsidized through a variety of strategies and conflicting interests, and the system that geared up for World War II is still the framework behind the US food system.  Congress goes to great lengths to subsidize feed like corn. Part of this is food policy based on price control, and part is a sop to farmers. The grain and meat producing areas of the country control an awful lot of US Senators. The feed is a big one, but low rates for grazing on public lands and access to abundant, cheap water are significant, too. Labor for slaughterhouses is very inexpensive for the U.S. economy. It can be argued that food safety costs are often lower than they should be, with the risk absorbed by the public. There are many different ways to look at subsidy for things like water and grazing. Would Southern California pay more for water used to flood fields? Yes, but that's not how water rights work.  Significantly, the costs paid to the public for grazing and water do not reflect the environmental impacts.  It's astounding, really, how cheap meat can be, especially chicken. Food is so cheap in the US for middle and upper income people that the market has recently responded with a variety of new approaches to raising animals for meat that cost consumers significantly more. Real or perceived improvements to animal welfare and diet are the primary drivers--there is a meaningful skepticism in the marketplace regarding animal husbandry practices and the market has become adept at responding to and shaping these concerns. Higher end ground beef, for example, has gone from about $4-5/lb (low fat, no hormones) ten years ago to $8-9/lb (low fat, organic, grass fed, improved animal welfare) today. For many/most low income people, however, the overall food system in the United States does a remarkable job at producing cheap if not extraordinarily healthy food. For people working two minimum wage jobs with minimal time for meal breaks and little time or money to prepare food, that 99 cent value menu at fast food joints gets them through.  Similarly for public school lunches. The schools put that food out for about $2.50 a meal, including labor. Incredible. So of course it's heavily processed, and includes a variety of ground meat products made from less expensive parts of the animal, including repurposing of slaughterhouse byproducts that would otherwise be waste.  As sketchy as this food may be, it's the most reliable meal of the day for many children. On top of the remarkably cheap baseline costs, additional subsidies for school lunches are funded in the same bill that subsidizes farmers. That means a lot in our incredibly unequal society, where school after school in low-income areas have 90%+ of their student body qualifying for a free breakfast and a lunch subsidy.  They start eating what is essentially fast food as young children, and never stop. ",

            "answer_text": "Americans are not particularly close to being the largest consumer of meat per capita. From my quick research, it seems the US is definitely not in the top ten. I also don\u2019t personally find such a stereotype to be particularly convincing. From my viewpoint, most Western countries care about meat a lot. We Scandinavians obsess over meat a lot, and I associate such practice also to Germany, the UK, Australia and Argentina, to name a few. It\u2019s also not a weird thing to obsess about. Meat is the ultimate food \u2014 for both good and bad \u2014 and food is essential for humans, and we are like tasty food. And part of the obsession is also the negative aspects of it. The fact that is might be bad for people\u2019s health and the environment and that it\u2019s expensive means that it can be seen as a treat, which only enhances the allure of it. And even when it\u2019s talked about in a strictly negative way, that is still talking about meat and helps keeping it prominently displayed in the public consciousness; \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity.\u201d. All in all I don\u2019t believe meat takes up a disproportionate role in any society I know of. People obsess about other food, and about alcohol and cars and guns and TV and celebrities and this and that and whatnot and whatever else. Do you know how obsessed people can about something as inane as the weather? Meat isn\u2019t essentially the only topic of small talk ever. There\u2019s no meat forecast after every news broadcast. We don\u2019t have meat apps which tell us about the status of all the meat in the area in the same way we have apps we use to check the temperature outside at that moment just because we can\u2019t be arsed to go outside and feel it for ourselves. And yet, meat is large proportion of the sustenance we consume to be able to survive, and a very enjoyable part of out diet, while weather is a largely irrelevant ambient state which becomes relevant when once in a blue moon there happens to be a torrential downpour just as we for once need to walk more than a couple of yards to reach our cars. Sorry, I got a little carried away there. Anyway. I think I\u2019ve communicated my point. ",
