            "answer_text": "The interesting part to me of the question is the implicit notion that Libya is a country with votes on things that matter when it no longer functions as a country in the regular sense. Syria has been the same way, although that\u2019s different because Assad didn\u2019t lose and kept control of the Alawite centers. This topic came up in the UN in a big way with China: China was \u2018Nationalist\u2019 China, which had moved to Taiwan, while \u2018Red\u2019 China was not internationally recognized as China. That took years to settle. There are varieties of this argument in other places, with one side clamoring to be recognized. The UN generally stays out as much as possible because the sad reality is that so many countries in the UN aren\u2019t particularly effective. Imagine this scenario: the Soviet Bloc along with the \u2018unaligned\u2019 world votes to recognize Irish sovereignty over Ulster/N. Ireland. Then what? Invasion to force Britain to comply is not likely. Would protestors in the US band behind the movement to boycott Britain? What if the US and all but the Soviet Bloc insisted that Lithuania\u2019s non-communist government-in-exile be seated in the UN, though it was then a conquered part of the USSR? Or if the UN gave a seat to Cyprus? As an aside, when Reagan called Nixon and described African states as \u2018monkeys\u2019, he was referring to the fact that the UN, with states that barely existed, had the \u2018gall\u2019 to tell the US what to do. Poor choices of words. I think he was trying to relate to Nixon, whom everyone knew used language like that a lot - but which didn\u2019t stop Nixon from working with blacks, Jews, etc. - so he conversationally adopted language that fit Nixon\u2019s speaking context. We all do that, adopting the language of the group. But the basic point is that nations like Libya today sit on panels in the UN though it\u2019s a real question whether they\u2019re really \u2018states\u2019, if having functional government matters. Syria has sat on various UN commissions while killing hundreds of thousands and using poison gas on its own people. (Didn\u2019t stop The Daily Mail from last week running a puff piece praising Assad\u2019s wife!) ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. For now (and probably for decades to come), Lybia\u2019s stance won\u2019t matter much - they have quite a lot of homework to do. It seems that we\u2019re finally seeing some baby steps in the right direction. Libyan rival leaders agree to ceasefire after Macron-hosted talks Specifically regarding the Arab-Israeli (nor Israeli-Palestinian) conflict, it\u2019s a safe bet they, as basically all Arabs, side with Palis (at least on words). But expecting them to have any significant role is asking too much from a non-neighbouring, poor and dilapidated nation. ",
