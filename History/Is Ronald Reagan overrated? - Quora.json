            "answer_text": "Ronald Reagan is not only overrated he was arguably one of the worst five or six president in US history. To my everlasting shame, embarrassment, and regret I voted for this ex-second rate actor. Reagan was actor actor in the role of a lifetime: playing the role of the optimistic and avuncular senior statesman. In reality, nothing could have been further from the truth. Reagan was willing to engage in race-baiting. He once gave a dog-whistle speech about \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d in the same county where decades earlier three civil rights workers had been murdered. He talked about a Cadillac-driving welfare queen with multiple addresses and identities who had defrauded the government for hundreds of thousands of dollars and falsely implied that this was widespread. The person to whom he was referring was a career criminal who gave her name as Linda Taylor, and fraud was probably the least serious entry on her rap-sheet. Upon entering office, Reagan had Congress slash taxes - concept that Bush correctly named \u201cVoodoo economics.\u201d Faced with ballooning deficits, however, Reagan subsequently raised taxes eleven times: the 1982 Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act was the single largest tax increase in US history. Worse, it shifted the burden from the wealthy - with far more disposable income - to the middle class and poor who had far less. These tax increases were still unable to compensate for the tax cuts for millionaires, so with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan\u2019s blessing, Reagan took money from the Social Security Trust Fund. The money has yet to be returned. The action were unable to stop the massive increase in national debt. By the end of Reagan\u2019s second term, the national debt had tripled and the US was no longer the world\u2019s creditors. It had become its largest debtor. In 1987, already in the early stages of dementia from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Reagan signed the repeal of the FCC\u2019s Fairness doctrine. Enacted in 1949, the rule required broadcasters to provide equal airtime to both sides of any issue. The repeal allowed creation of unchallenged broadcasting of disinformation, harebrained conspiracy theories, and lies. The Iran-Contra scandal was essentially a criminal conspiracy in Reagan\u2019s administration to violate the laws enacted by Congress. A large number of people were indicted and several were imprisoned. Reagan claimed he didn\u2019t know or couldn\u2019t remember. This was undoubtedly an honest answer: Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by memory failure in all its different manifestations. (Neurologists speak of the five-A\u2019s of Alzheimer\u2019s disease: amnesia, aphasia, agnosia, anomia, and apraxia,) Reagan was never that popular while he was in office and most Americans did not agree with his policies: by the end of his presidency most believed that the nation was on the wrong track. The economic recovery during the 1980s was not due to the tax cuts weighted heavily toward the rich. Declining oil prices, regression toward the mean of normal business cycles, and the fiscal policies of Jimmy Carter\u2019s Federal Reserve chairman did far more. What Reagan\u2019s tax cut undoubtedly did was to give birth to CEO and Wall Street greed. The money never did \u201ctrickle down\u201d because it was off-shored so that CEOs could rake in even more money. It was in fact Bush Sr and Bill Clinton rolling back Reaganomics during the 1990s that spurred a decade of peace and prosperity. The Reagan Legend is no more than creative fiction drafted by Republicans purposes that were purely partisan. More details can be found Will Bunch\u2019s book, Tear Down This Myth: The Right-Wing Distortion of the Reagan Legacy. ",

            "answer_text": "To call Reagan overrated is a gross understatement. He\u2019s more than that, he is arguably the most damaging President we\u2019ve had in the last fifty years. Reagan\u2019s infamous policy of \u201cGovernment is the problem\u201d created a facile sort of thinking on the right that stemmed from the man\u2019s natural charisma. He made them feeeeeel good, so, to this very day, countless Republicans bow at the altar of Saint Ronnie. Never mind the damage he did to the welfare state and the explicit demonization of the poor and oppressed in this country. It was Reagan who gave birth to the image of the Welfare Queen, a huge black woman and her countless, uncontrolled offspring riding their way to the food stamps office in style while she sells drugs on the side to keep herself rolling in dough. Never mind that Reagan knowingly and maliciously allowed the AIDS crisis to rampage throughout the gay community for years and only acted when Ryan White got it from a blood transfusion. The first time the AIDS crisis was even mentioned by Reagan, he laughed about it. You know, in certain circles, allowing a pandemic to go unchecked because it\u2019s eliminating an undesired minority is consider a form of genocide. Never mind that Reaganomics that was an unmitigated disaster that put us through multiple recessions and dangerously unbalanced the budget as he slashed taxes and ran military spending up to record levels, a tradition all of his Republican predecessors have followed. And who could forget the gem of it all, Trickle Down Economics? The Reagan Era took this crock of shit and made it the centerpiece of right wing economic ideology. The wealthy enjoy getting their taxes cut to less than nothing while wages stagnate, infrastructure crumbles, the quality of our schools flatlines, and inequality explodes across the nation. That\u2019s ignoring all the palace intrigue, the collusion with terrorists to get elected, Iran-Contra, letting his wife run the game for the last couple of years while his addled mind began to fail, who herself was under the influence of an astrologer! Reagan isn\u2019t just overrated, he was a negligent, dangerous ideologue who allowed hundreds of thousands of Americans to die because of their sexual orientation, demolished the social safety net of this country, poisoned our economic ideologies, and should have been impeached and imprisoned for his crimes. I am supremely glad he is mouldering in his grave. There isn\u2019t a flame in Hell hot enough to give that bastard what he deserves. ",
