            "answer_text": "No. The Supreme Court determined this in Texas v. White. It\u2019s settled law and doubtful to be revisited. On point of the decision went to the Articles of Confederation. That document refers to a \u201cperpetual Union between the States.\u201d This was never revoked or changed. Supreme Court Justice Joesph Story wrote \u201cThe constitution of a confederated republic, that is, of a national republic, formed of several states, is, or at least may be, not less an irrevocable form of government, than the constitution of a state formed and ratified by the aggregate of the several counties of the state.\u201d In one sentence, Story reduced the states to the status of a county, shire, or province, and this general argument was used as a hammer both during Reconstruction and after against the sovereignty of the states.\u201c \u201cAnother argument against secession centers on the language of Article I, Section 10, which declares that \u201cNo state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation\u2026.\u201d To proponents of this position, Article I, Section 10 unequivocally shows that the states which formed the Confederate States of America were in clear violation of the Constitution, thus invalidating their government and the individual acts of secession which led to it. \u201c On writer argued that Jefferson Davis wasn\u2019t brought to trial as this would raise troubling questions about secession. Davis was caught wearing his wife\u2019s cloak and Secretary of War Stratton put out the Favis was caught in full female costume. This backfired as Davis became such a laughingstock, that it was better to jail, the release him. Further, there were hundreds of not thousands of confederate veterans that could also be brought to trail on the same charges. Last, the United States never recognized the confederacy. It was a rebellion and not a nation. Is Secession Legal? | The American Conservative ",

            "answer_text": "No. Lincoln best expressed in several speeches the reason why the Confederacy did not have the right to secede. He said that the creation of the Union by the Constitution in 1787 was a contract among the several states. Like any legal contract, this contract only could be terminated by the agreement of all the contracting parties. The contracting parties were the states that contracted to form the the Union in 1787 and new states that later agreed to the contract and joined the Union. Accordingly, a minority of states legally could not choose to break the contract by seceding and forming the Confederacy. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it didn\u2019t. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I get why they did. The North had rapidly industrialized. Their economy didn\u2019t rely on slave labor. The South would\u2019ve collapsed if they lost their slaves. There was also an intense battle in Congress over this and it had less to do with slaves and more to do with which faction was adding new states to its rank. This is in no way a defense of slavery. Many in the South were deeply divided about it too. ",

            "answer_text": "The argument made by the secessionists was that the states had created the federal union and then agreed to join it. The state governments that approved joining the federal Union were never dissolved and continued to exist. That interpretation would make the federal Union created by the U.S. constitution more like a treaty between sovereign states than the creation of one new nation. This argument does have some merit, but the military victory of the Federal government over the states that were trying to leave during the Civil War makes it pretty much moot. ",
