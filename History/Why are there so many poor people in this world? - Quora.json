            "answer_text": "Currently, in the United States there are areas with less jobs and too many workers. In a few areas there are too many jobs and not a good population that fits the skills needed. Then there are scattered business owners who lie about not finding employees just so they can apply for hb1 visas, after all it is cheaper to ship certain skilled blue collar laborers and technically skilled workers. regardless of the reason.. even more industries are dehumanizing their labor forces. this reduces money going into worker hands and further reduces money flowing through our economy.. without a steady distribution between citizens, businesses and government\u2026 poverty happens and the effects creep up from the bottom. In the 1980\u2019s, businesses began adding more and more technology to their production lines. Banks began using simple automatic tellers to reduce need for cashiers and reduce customer service times. Other examples were robots were replacing hospital employees by delivering meds, inventory and parking services. By the early 2000\u2019s, stores began to move online to \u201cdrop ship\u201d modes of consumerism. Retailers didn\u2019t need to distribute to stores when they could skip the overhead costs of opening a store and paying human staff\u2026 just directly ship from their warehouse storage centers. The cost of shipping passed onto customers instead of handled in house. Physical store retailers faced having to close their stores due to wide range of prices and more variety found online. Put simply they could not afford to compete. Customers found convenience and social safety by not entering physical stores. Many customers loved not having to face the inevitable backlash of an overwork or abused cashier, didn\u2019t face being marginalized by some worker with a hate for diversity and were no longer snubbed by fellow upscale store patrons and staff. Customers saw a reduction in most of the negatives that made going to a physical store a pain. Unfortunately with all the automation and advances in technology came closure to physical locations, mass lay-offs, position terminations and less money circulating through the over-all economy. More jobs have also migrated over seas and no replacements have been significant enough to replace those jobs that don\u2019t intend to come back. The jobs that have remained in America seem bent on driving down the cost of human labor while owners pay any cost to advance research to eliminate the total human cost factor from their overhead costs. As more Americans follow their dreams and parents\u2019 advice to go to higher education or vocational schools they find that the investments are returning void. \u201cGetting a great education and learning a wanted skill .. no long equates to the employment longevity of the times before 1970\u2032s..where folks died either in their jobs or lived long enough to see retirement.\u201d As pay is reduced.. the same businesses that rely on consumers see consumerism shrink and tend to make up the loss by inflating the most consistently bought products.. while still shrinking the pay of workers and increasing their laborious responsibilities.. Necessities are being priced out of reach. Mortgage loans and price tags on decent housing skyrocket. home ownership are keys to creating happy American stable tax payers , are now completely out of reach of most poor, lower and mid level middle class families. While many Americans were blaming desperate poor and low income americans for going into deeper poop for trying to get shelter.. folks over looked the damage and destruction caused by a now deemed untrustworthy fiduciary system. More people would be entrenched deeper into a cycle of poverty, guaranteeing more generations would be mired by the effects of financially crushing 30 yr loan payments that remain even after a foreclosure. The price of food, clothes and gas have skyrocketed. Farmers are not reaping the whirlwind profit, but instead point to distributors and grocery chains that make them produce animals and crops under a specific margin and then whatever is left they get to include as profit with the contractually agreed upon price. More farmers are working for huge conglomerations and the individual farmer is facing difficulty. ..this is causing changes in how farming is done and where it is done. Recently suburbs and inner city dwellers are pushing for more microfarms. ..and providing food to places where food deserts exist. As more people get pushed to the bottom ..a few are able to bounce back but many more are not. These are the ones that are finding alternative ways to eliminate needing currency to survive. They are the new anti consumers.. the new free economy participants. The old system is not benefiting them and depending on the successes they find outside a financially based economy may determine what a new economy may adapt into. 87,500 jobs per year eliminated over the last 5 years. We have 7 million unemployed currently and 6.2 million jobs available . Labor Department data Dec. 2017 source- The Hill - covering Congress, Politics, Political Campaigns and Capitol Hill, Labor department. \u2026there are other self inflicted consequences for growing poverty but this is a section exploring how things are out of most average citizen\u2019s hands..

            "answer_text": "\u201cA lot\u201d is a vague term that can mean whatever anyone wants. In the United States 12.7% of the population is poor; this means that 87.3% is not poor. One can argue whether the official poverty rate is the correct measure, but the weighted average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2016 was $24,563 a year (about $12,140 for a single person). U.S. poverty is remarkably luxurious when we make world comparisons. According to World Bank 2004 statistics (the figures are older because worldwide comparable figures are hard to come by) about half the world\u2019s population, 3 billion people, live on less than US$2.50 a day and 80% on less than US$10 a day (annualized that would be $912.50 and $3,650 a year, respectively). As a result, the officially poor person of the United States has an income that is between close to 4 times and more than 12 times higher. Ok, but you asked why. After years of reading studies, my conclusion is that you are most likely to be poor if (a) you were born to poor parents or (b) you are innately incapable of making the kind of income that would raise you above a certain poverty \u201cline,\u201d whatever it is. On the whole, both are random and involuntary occurrences. A very small proportion of people move up or down the income ladder, again largely through a combination of mostly accidental occurrences. I\u2019ll go just a bit further and say that overall, poverty is not a human condition that is unavoidable \u2014 particularly if we define poverty as the United Nations does, a conditions that deprives human beings of \u201ca standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.\u201d For the first time in history, for about the last 100 years or so, we have collectively had the productive capacity to feed, clothe, house and care for every single person, at least at an \u201cadequate\u201d level. We, collectively, simply don\u2019t want that. ",
