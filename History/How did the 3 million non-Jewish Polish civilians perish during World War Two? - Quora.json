            "answer_text": "So, as we know, Jews were exterminated on an industrialized scale, thus the whole number of 3 million Polish Jews + 3 million Jews from other countries was technically possible. But how is it feasible to kill other 3 million people without specialized means of killing, like gas chambers? Well, the answer is easy, just add up these two factors. 1. Planned extermination - Nazis treated Slavs, Poles and Russians in particular, as untermenschen - lesser people, comparing them to Jews. Thus, they were treated terribly and were killed en masse since the first days of war. Shooting of civilians was a standard procedure for German units, columns of refugees were even bombed to make way for advancing armies. Polish lands were meant for Germans in grand plan for the Reich drawn up by Hitler and all Poles were meant to be killed or enslaved, thus the value of Polish life equaled to almost nothing.2. Long occupation - Poland was the first country to be Invaded by Germany by force and it was under Nazi occupation for almost 6 years. This fact added to the above institutionalized hatred towards Poles gave Nazis plenty of time to subjugate and kill Polish populace. Let\u2019s talk details and numbers: During the September 1939 campaign almost 200 000 Poles were killed due to mass shootings and terror bombings - aforementioned disregard for civilian life took its toll from the first days of World War 2.  Warsaw, Polish capital, in September 1939 - 25% of the city was destroyed during air raids and artillery bombardments. During the whole war more than 80% of Warsaw was turned to dust. Poles were the first inmates of concentration camps, before they were turned into industrialized death camps. Polish prisoners built Auschwitz and were (along with the Russian POWs) first people to die there before mass deportation of Jews started after 1941. Through the whole war more than 400 000 Poles died in German camps (around 70 000 in Auschwitz alone) and prisons run by Gestapo (around 40 000 in Pawiak - one small police precinct in Warsaw!) for their political views or simply for the fact they were deemed dangerous by the Nazi regime (meaning - most members of the church, intelligentsia, government officials, popular public figures etc.) Another 200 000 Poles perished in mass executions and due to mistreatment (including tortures) around the country during the years of occupation. People were killed for smallest infractions, especially for hiding Jews - Poland was the only occupied country in which helping Jews was punishable by death. The biggest loss of Polish life in the shortest span of time was the Warsaw Uprising - in the end, huge civilian massacres, reprisals and literally razing the city to the ground brought death to 250 000 Civilians.  Civilians murdered in one of the massacres during Warsaw Uprising - 50 000 citizens were brutally killed in Wola city district alone. Diseases and famine were another factors that brought down the population of Poland - as the citizens were treated very poorly, food, water and basic amenities were hard to come by. The same goes for medical help. Germans didn\u2019t care for Polish civilians, stole most of the crops to feed their armies and didn\u2019t give a damn who died along the way. Nearly 80% of population relied on black market to eat and drink anything and massive malnutrition meant increased disease prevalence. It is hard to estimate number of deaths in this case, but it is not hard to see the difference in the standards of living during the war and after it - my grandfather was 7 at the start of the war in 1939 and due to severe undernourishment he and most of his peers born shortly before the war are a head or two shorter than their kids born in the late 50s and early 60s. My grandfather is around 160 cm (5\u20322), my father stands at about 180 cm (5\u20329), I\u2019m over 190 cm (6\u20322). So you can imagine how different life was then and how severe the effects of long occupation were. Estimates collectively call the death of malnutrition and disease as \u201cexhaustion\u201d or \u201cdeath due to occupation\u201d and count around at least 600 000 casualties. Another casualties of war include those of almost 2 million Poles deported to Germany to work there as slaves. Out of those subjugated, around 200 000 died due to hard labor conditions and mistreatment. One of the most horrible statistics is the so called \u201cKidnapping of Polish Children\u201d - Nazis, to boost their numbers, took 200 000 young Polish kids to raise them as German. No more than 30 000 returned after the war, the rest of those poor little souls were never seen again by their relatives. Do not forget to add 100 000 Polish victims of ethnic cleansing in the East in 1943\u20131944 - Ukrainian nationalists (UPA) backed by Ukrainian populace brutally murdered Polish citizens, minorities and even other Ukrainians who did not want to take part in the genocide to make room for their countrymen. UPA militia maimed, immolated, bayoneted and hacked men, women and children in gruesome ways to scare away those Poles who still wanted to stay on formerly Polish frontier. And they succeeded, displacing rest of the Polish settlers who fled west to German occupied territory (there has to be some new name for this kind of greater evil if you seek refuge from it by escaping under the wings of a nazi regime). Germany was not the only occupier - Soviets attacked Poland hand in hand with the Germans when they were still pals. Under Stalinist rule more than 150 000 Poles died. Russians executed all those who would oppose the new communist way of life: priests, teachers, government officials and anyone who looked at them funny. They were also responsible for a largest massacre of unarmed military personnel of the war - shooting of more than 20 000 Polish officers caught during the September campaign. Last, but not least - we can\u2019t forget about immense war effort of Polish soldiers on all European fronts. Around 250 000 Polish military personnel died on Western and Eastern fronts through 6 long years of the conflict. All in all, if you add the above numbers, you\u2019ve got more than 2 500 000 million ethnic Poles dead and those deaths are verifiable through numerous documents. Historians add around 200 000 more from different causes which cannot be clearly verified and are listed as miscellaneous. For example, effect of soviet deportations is hard to estimate - more than 1 million Poles were sent to soviet labor camps, many of them stayed there, some died while some simply could not get back to their homes. It is agreed that numbers 2,5 million deaths from German occupation and 200 000 more from soviet one are not exaggerated in one bit. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow, this would need a whole book. The single most relevant factor was that the Nazi aggression was very different from most of the centuries of traditions of the European wars. This time, the Nazi objective was to annihilate or drastically reduce whole nations. It was not about land or resources only. In European wars, civilians used to be bypassed by armies. OK, some mass murder during a city sacking could happen, but it was frowned upon and, from what I understand, not that common. Most importantly, traditionally the murders of civilians were done (if at all) by the military, in the heat of battle, or shortly after. Occupation administration (military or civilian) was not murderous, they tried to keep order and fairly normal laws. The Nazi state+military machine was very different. The military was conquering the territories explicitly to enable the state apparatus to murder the inhabitants. The \u201ccombined arms\u201d concept went well beyond strictly military ops. The military would murder civilians during a military campaign if the opportunity arose, but the same military was an integrated part of the comprehensive murder machine instituted after the strictly military operations ceased. To be fair, a lot of people in German army refused to get dragged into a strict butchery. But many got involved, it was hard to avoid, if a local German administration had a problem, local German troops were obliged to help to solve it. In the Polish case, on average about 1500 gentile Poles were being killed a day, 1939\u201345, mostly civilians. This started in September 1939 with shooting at people who were trying to escape from areas of battle. For example my father was feet away (second week of September 1939) from a woman shot dead by a German soldier, in a group of civilian refugees. He remembers the impact points on the ground of the machine gun fire, walking up to take her life. Close distance. She was a mother of his school class friend, 1st grade. For all I know, that sport had no legal ramifications inside German forces. The estimate for September 1939 is about 100K Polish civilians dead. Then the more planned undertakings took place. A continuous process of culling educated people: teachers, businessmen, priests, physicians etc. A ten thousand here, a ten thousand there, it does add up (the total was over 200K, maybe more, that venue). Do not forget pre-prepared lists of people Germany did not like. For example large parts of Poland used to be, pre-1914, held by Prussia (as a result of the Polish Partitions end of 18th century). In 1918 in many towns some people were raising Polish flags, organizing local Polish administration, organizing Polish schools (Prussia did not like to have Polish schools) etc. Turns out, twenty years later some people in Germany did not forget, they had lists of those names. For example in the town of Ostr\u00f3w Wielkopolski there is a separate section in the cemetery, graves of people (by then often rather old) who were, first thing in September 1939, dragged out of their homes and shot. Most towns in Western Poland have such sections at their cemeteries. It does add up. Then there was the arithmetic of calories issue. Germany used to import serious amount of grain and meat from overseas, before 1939. Once they started WWII, Nazis had a problem (never mind they had no money any more to pay for those imports). The way the numbers went, they had to decrease consumption by people on territories they conquered. The way the numbers worked, an average Pole could eat about 500\u2013800kcal/day, eating more would mean some German would go hungry. The amount necessary to keep a human alive is about 1300kcal/day. So there was a daily grind, across all of Poland, of Polish farmers shot on the spot for missing yearly grain delivery quotas by a hundred kilo, smugglers of food into the cities shot for hiding a piece of a bacon under an overcoat, etc etc. Railway stations were execution places, daily. Luckily for the Poles, there was an enormous amount of money to be made from millions of people desperate to stay alive, so the Nazi administration in Poland presided over a mathematical miracle of large towns stubbornly living on impossibly low food allocations. The Jewish Poles had it much harder, they were physically restricted from moving and physically isolated. So they starved to death. And there was a constant, low-level fight. It was really low level, usually not more than 20\u201340 Germans killed a day. But the German response was to do revenge killings of hostages, at high exchange rates. So this added up. And there was a daily grind of attrition and recovery of thousands and thousands cells of the resistance network. German arrests were a norm, they had fairly good intelligence, many agents deep in the Polish society. It was a high effort to maintain Underground, people were constantly being added to replace losses. Poland was quite possibly a beneficiary, in a way, of the fact that Reinhard Heydrich (Himmler\u2019s right hand) got assassinated by Czech and British operatives. That guy was able to emasculate all resistance movement in Czechia, and was on the way to do the same in Poland. A competent guy, Hitler had few people like this. I wrote \u201cin a way\u201d, as this meant that a fight in Poland continued, with attending casualties. But well, it was up to us to slack off, we did not, for some reason. To sum up, the whole society was rather close to a breaking point, due to the losses. Memoirs of the era give a rather grim reading. It is hard to appreciate today, how difficult achievement it was, to maintain resistance. ",

If all the known figures of ethnic Polish deaths during the Second World War are added up, ie military and civilian deaths during the initial German and Soviet invasions in 1939, military deaths during subsequent campaigns fought by Polish armies in exile, deaths of prisoners in German concentration camps, deaths of POWs and civilian deportees in the Soviet Union, deaths during German anti-partisan operations, deaths of civilian labour conscripts in Germany, military and civilian deaths during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, partisan and civilian deaths during inter-ethnic conflict with Ukrainians, the total comes to well under two million, probably only half the alleged three million. The reason why the post-war Communist government exaggerated the number of ethnic Polish deaths to make it equal the number of Polish Jewish deaths is that that government consisted largely of ethnic Jews, Communists who had returned from exile in the Soviet Union, and its members were afraid that if they made it known that Jews had been victimised far more than ethnic Poles, the Polish people would see them as a \u201cJewish regime\u201d that favoured its fellow Jews over the rest of the population.
