            "answer_text": "\"Slavic people\" is a linguistic term and I know what it means: Native speakers of one of the group of Slavic languages. But I haven't heard of the term \"true Slav\" yet. This question cannot be reasonably answered until you have clarified what you mean by the term \"True Slav\" and what is the difference between the term \u201cSlavic\u201d and \u201ctrue Slavic\u201d. In my opinion, all those who naturally speak one of Slavic languages are true Slavs, whatever is their ethnic origin or cultural background. Language has nothing to do with genetics. The children of Vietnamese parents, who were born in the Czechia, have Czech citizenship and speak Czech well, are full-fledged and true Czechs and Slavs, as well as the children of a Czech mother and a black father who grew up in the Czech environment from birth. By the way: Wasn't Pushkin a true Russian and a Slav? He had a black grandfather: Abram Petrovich Gannibal - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "In order to answer this question one would need to answer the question \u2018What\u2019s a true Slav?\u2019. Being a Slav myself I would most likely judge a Slav from a non-Slav based on culture and traditions, and a kind of Slavic understanding. Slavs separated from each other not long ago and we still have some features that make us quite similar. I\u2019ve travelled through most of the Slavic countries and always find that talking to another Slav is easier than talking to a non-Slav. There are a lot of things you don\u2019t have to explain to a Slav, they are just given to you at birth, if you\u2019re a Slav. So, eventually, all Slavic peoples are true Slavs. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that the question has a different meaning: \"why do the Slavic peoples differ from each other?\" This is because some Slavic peoples are holders of the so-called Indo-European language, which came to Europe from Asia (haplogroup R1a). Another part of the modern Slavs is the ancestral inhabitants of Europe, who were assimilated (haplogroup I). Over time, they mixed slightly. In modern Slavs, there are other haplogroups. There are no nations with only one haplogroup in Europe. ",
