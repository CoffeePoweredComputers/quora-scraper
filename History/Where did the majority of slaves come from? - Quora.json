            "answer_text": "From where did the majority of slaves come? This answer presumes that the response concerns that era when the Atlantic slave trade was still legal.  The demographic condition of those families of African descent in British North America is largely obscured by the fact that the overwhelming majority were slaves who left no personal accounts of their lives until the middle of the 19th century.[i] The actual place of origin of African slaves is somewhat obscured by the common practice of using of the point of sale on the coast of Africa as a point of origin in the colonial records. Seven coastal regions have been identified as the origins of Africans brought to the Americas as slaves. These are Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Windward Coast, the Gold Coast, the Blight of Benin, the Blight of Biafra, and the Central Southeast African coast. Records kept in this manner tend to conceal a much richer and more diverse cultural background encompassing possibly dozens of ethnic groups and regional tribes. Some of these ethnic groups were identified in the 19th century, and they include the Wolof, Malinke, Temne, Fulbe, Susu, Mende, Koso, Sherbro, Basa, Akan, Kromantees, Fon, Gun, Popos, Yoruba, Nupe, Benin, Ibo, Efik, Ibibo, Calabahs, Bantu, and Hausa groups, and several regional groups from the Congo or Mozambique.[ii] More recent research suggests that the greatest number of Africans brought to Virginia and the Carolinas were drawn from among the Bantu speaking people of the Niger delta and the Gold Coast.[iii]  Until very late in the 18th century \u201cvirtually no white men had ever seen anything of the African interior,\u201d and contemporary European statements as to the conditions prevalent there were almost completely conjectural. Certainly there was a widespread and highly successful determination on the part of the coastal slave trading tribes to keep white slavers out. Except at the coastal trading stations, the trade in slaves was controlled entirely by black Africans, many of whom were Muslim slave raiders from the interior.  In the Niger delta the trade was organized by the Oracle, a judicious-religious body that condemned hundreds of persons to be enslaved and acted as an intermediary agency between the coastal tribes and those in the interior. Likewise the Ashanti, a tribal group located in the heart of the slave raiding country, became as powerful as some feudal European states. They developed tradition-based legal institutions, a tax and revenue system, and a military organization that could field tens of thousands of warriors for extended campaigns. Groups like the Oracle and the Ashanti helped to structure operative agreements, \u201ceffective over hundreds of square miles,\u201d that made it possible to exclude Europeans from a vigorous slave trade economy.[iv] [i] Even among these, there are questions of authenticity, perspective, and propaganda.

In the 360 years between 1500 and the end of the slave trade in the 1860s, at least 12 million Africans were forcibly taken to the Americas - then known as the \"New World\" to European settlers. This largest forced migration in human history relocated some 50 ethnic and linguistic groups. The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were people from Central, South-East, and West Africa.

When the African slaves came to America, some mixed with their European white masters and with Native Americans. There are many Black Indians.From this information, you now can understand the linkage to ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdoms..
