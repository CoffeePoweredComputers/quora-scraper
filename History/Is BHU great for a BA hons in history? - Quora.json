            "answer_text": "After spending more or less a decade at Banaras Hindu University, I think I am a suitable person to answer this question. I would like to answer this question presenting the facts as well as reality. BHU has two separate departments dedicated to Historical studies. One comes under the Faculty of Social sciences: Dept. of History; whereas, the other one falls under Faculty of Arts: Dept. of AIHC & Arch. AIHC & Arch. department of BHU is one of the most reputed departments of the world, and is undoubtedly the torch bearer in this field when it comes to Asian Universities. You will gain theoretical as well as practical knowledge there. Workshops and Field trips are organised time to time there to provide students ample exposure. Further, Varanasi and surrounding areas, being a field of historical importance through the ages, starting from the pre-historic period to modern age, serve as a great subject for students here. History department of BHU also is no less in this case. Through various academic and non-academic activities going on all the time, It provides a great platform to its students. You will certainly get a great exposure here. PS: Just like other institutions, there are Faculties and Research scholars which are very co-operative, at the same time there are others who are selfish, unhelpful and may start being jealous of your personal development. The later type is what you will find in majority there :) Hope that answers the question. ",
