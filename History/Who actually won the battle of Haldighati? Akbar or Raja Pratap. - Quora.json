            "answer_text": "The battle of Haldighati was fought between the armies of Akbar and Maharana Pratap. Akbar was focusing on conquering Gujarat through the route of Mewar. In the region that we now know as Rajasthan, he was settling his relationship with Rajputs on cordial terms, but Mewar would not yeild. So the Mughal tropes led by Raja Maan Singh of Amber attacked mewar and Maharana Pratap Singh held them in a combat at Haldi Ghati. While more than 1500 Mewar soldiers lost their lives, and an injured Maharana Pratap fled the battle field and went into hiding into the nearby areas, less than 300 Mughal soilders were killed and they captured the areas of Haldi Ghati and surrounding. But it was not a significant win for Akbar as the minute he lost his focus on that region, Maharana Pratap came out of hiding and recaptured his lost territories. So the Mughals won the battle of Haldi Ghati but it hardly helped them expand strategically. ",

            "answer_text": "The battle of Haldighati was fought in 1576. Akbar wanted to expand his kingdom and thought it was not possible without making alliances with the rajputs, so Akbar sent various peace treaties to Maharana Pratap but he refused all of them and thus it led to the 4 hour war between Mughals and rajputs. The attack from Mughals was led by Maan singh, Akbar's army consisted 80,000 soldiers and maharanpratap only had 3,000 soldiers. Well, inspite of the odds maharanpratap fought bravely\u2026though in the middle of battle he was surrounded by Mughal soldiers but he managed to escape with the help of his horse \u2018chetak'. Therefore, there is no such information of who won the war because Mughals also had several casualties. Later Maharana Pratap captured most of his kingdom again. ",
