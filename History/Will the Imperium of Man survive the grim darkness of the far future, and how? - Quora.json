            "answer_text": "Will the Imperium of Man survive the grim darkness of the far future, and how? No. They\u2019ve already set it in stone as canon back in the Horus Heresy series. If Horus had killed the emperor, he would\u2019ve gone into grieving, then in his rage, he would have destroyed the chaos gods. If he failed to kill the emperor, then the imperium would limp along for the next ten thousand years or so, and eventually be consumed by Slaanesh. That was about ten thousand years ago in the timeline. Tick tock, time\u2019s running out. Mankind is absolutely screwed though in that setting, but it won\u2019t happen during the timeframe the game\u2019s covering. They\u2019ll probably just use it as a last moment \u201cwe\u2019re closing our studio, Slaanesh noms everything, done.\u201d But yeah, it\u2019s been stated that way quite awhile ago. There\u2019s no escaping that fate, only temporarily postponing it. ",
