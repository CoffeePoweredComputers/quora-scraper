S-2 was ~800lbs, and with 37HP it flew 85 kts, landing speed <18kts. Stall-spin proof. Video shows it to be nimble and stable.     (Rebuilt minus the wing-tip controls) It was probably the leader of the Nazi interest in a circular-wing plane, the AS-6, which didn't fly. There was also post-war interest in such things: the Avrocar was only the VTOL half of a supersonic fighter. Avro Canada / USAF Weapons System 606a    Note the lack of substantial landing gear. With the lift-engine it didn't need them. A Rockwell engineer was asked to shorten the Space Shuttle launch stack. Result was shown to expect lower re-entry heating and G-loads, more cross-range, better flight handling, lower landing speed.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the family of experimental jet planes designed by the French engineer Ren\u00e9 Leduc, namely Leduc 0.10, Leduc 0.21 and Leduc 0.22, must be mentioned.  I remember perfectly how, as a child, I was fascinated by these aircraft when I first observed them in an aeronautical book from the mid-1960s I had at home. Only as I grew up could I reappreciate the idea behind these incredible planes and the reasons behind the bizarre shapes. All three planes developed by Leduc focused on the development of a new propulsion technology, the ramjet.  These reactors constitute an evolution of the turbo-jets (above): they do not have the initial compressor and consequently not even the terminal turbine but to compress the incoming air they use a simple ogive which, breaking against the flow of incoming air at high speed, performs the function of a normal compressor. The ramjets are therefore performing at high speeds and characterized by a very low complexity of design as they do not have moving parts.  The first ramjet dated back to 1915 when the Austrian inventor Albert Fon\u00f2 proposed an artillery projectile coupled with such a system in order to drastically increase its range. It can be said, however, that the idea of implementing such systems for the controlled flight of aircraft came from Leduc himself, who from 1938 set to work to develop a new family of aircraft capable of mounting such a propulsion system. The work also continued during the conflict and came to an end in 1947 with Leduc 0.10.  The thing that fascinated me most about this aircraft was the fact that the control cockpit was directly located inside the air inlet for the stator: in a nutshell, the pilot sat virtually inside the engine in an ogival-shaped cabin that in case of emergency would be detached from the rest of the aircraft to allow the escape. The design of the cabin inevitably made the pilot's view very bad. As a result, it was decided to make portholes on the outer wall of the stator in order to allow the pilot to improve lateral visibility.  A major problem facing the designers was the need to start the ramjet as its inlet needed a flow of air travelling at high speed given that it had not any mechanical part for the suction of the air. The solution would have been to mount the Leduc above the fuselage of a transport plane which would have been a sort of \"mother ship\" and would have released it once in flight with sufficient speed to allow the correct operation of the reactor. After the first bound flights and the various glide tests, on April 21, 1949 the engine was finally started in flight, for twelve minutes at half power, pushing the aircraft at a speed of 680 km/h. Subsequently, the plane demonstrated the effectiveness of ramjet propulsion applied to an aircraft reaching a speed of Mach 0.84 and climb rates (39.6 m/s) higher than the best fighter planes of the time.  With the Leduc 0.10, the project turned out a success and made the ramjet a technology that could be implemented in aeronautical flight although perhaps not as versatile as the turbojet. Precisely for these reasons, a further model was developed: the Leduc 0.21.  The new model was nothing more than a 30% enlarged version of the Leduc 0.10, to which some technical and functional improvements had also been made (such as the cockpit located outside the engine).  The aircraft reached an altitude of 20 000 metres and a speed of 900 km/h, bringing closer the possibility of possible use of the ramjets for supersonic flight.  So it was that we proceeded in this direction with the development of Leduc 0.22 in 1956, only three years after the previous model.   The new aircraft was to become an interceptor capable of reaching a speed of Mach 2 (2469.6 km/h). In order to make this job feasible, it would have been necessary to abandon the release of the aircraft from the \"mother ship\" and so it was decided to incorporate a turbojet inside the stator aeration door to allow the aircraft to take off with its own power and accelerate up to the speed necessary to start the stator.  However, the stator ignition never happened: the project was closed due to lack of economic resources during the tests of Leduc 0.22, which since then remains a valuable example of the genius and bizarreness of its designer. This project was not a total waste of time afterall. In fact, when a few years later the U.S. had to implement a new supersonic reconnaissance aircraft, it fell back on the choice of ramjets and proceeded to the same solution that had been seen in Leduc 0.22, that is, to merge ramjet and turbojet together. That was how the Lockheed SR-71, Blackbird, was born.  The study of the reactors conducted within the project that produced the Leduc was also of extraordinary utility for the development of propulsion systems of missiles and drones that, given the very high speeds that they must reach and having to be light and inexpensive, still use the ramjet as a propulsion system.
