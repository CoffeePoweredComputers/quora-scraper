            "answer_text": "To some extent, you can achieve that as long as you don't expect too much. You can maintain and improve strength, balance, stamina, posture, muscle tone at the old age and beyond. The key is to start planning a decade or two before you begin deteriorating or, worse, passing the point of no return. The formula is not complicated; you must be resourceful and proactive, ambitious, determined for success, follow the correct lifestyle. If all the conditions are favorable to the project, everything conducted correctly; you have a good shot at living your life in your 60s, 70s, and beyond enjoying an excellent quality of life. Your diet (what you eat and drink) is the main thing, and genetics, medical conditions, starting point, stress level, environment, type of physical exertion, body type, and overall long-term lifestyle would determine the outcome. The sooner you start a rehabilitative path, the better the result, the more lasting effects. I began a decade ago. I have stayed true and faithful to the lifestyle. The health and longevity benefits are amazing and keep coming at 65. I should have started much earlier. I must add that I workout and train regularly and sincerely to maintain the flow of health benefits\u2014no free lunch. ",

Not to mention playing ball a few hours a day and of course we old folks all like to proposition girls young enough to be our granddaughters because the state likes to provide us old folks with free room and board. One day a couple of girls came through the line and one of them was complaining that her debit card wasn\u2019t working. She said how am I supposed to get gas if my debit card doesn\u2019t work? I said, wait until you\u2019re my age and then you\u2019ll have plenty of gas. I could go on for quite a while but if you have any imagination you should be able to think up the rest on your own. ",
