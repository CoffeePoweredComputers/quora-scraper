            "answer_text": "No, I also don\u2019t think he was as good as the majority of people think. That said, all of those politicians he beat had legitimate military training and experience and his defeat at Zama was a sound defeat but not something most people would call catastrophic. With that out of the way: I think that it\u2019s ridiculous to place Hannibal so firmly above the brilliant man who defeated him, as almost everyone seems to, as if Hannibal could be so good but be defeated accidentally? I swear, without fail, that whenever somebody brings up his defeat at Zama they will blame it on his inferior troops and cavalry disadvantage while conceding nearly nothing to his opponent\u2019s superior effort. Hannibal had a cavalry advantage in every battle he won! As for his lower quality of troops: he had a roughly even number of troops to his opponent at Zama\u2014so the man who could encircle a Roman army twice his size and cut them down was at some insurmountable disadvantage because he didn\u2019t get as much quality time with his soldiers before losing? He had as much time with his army as many of the generals he defeated. I\u2019ve been dancing around the other general\u2019s name because I want to write it here with the respect it deserves: Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus the Elder. Scipio died of old age as an undefeated general who thoroughly destroyed every Carthaginian general that he met, including Hannibal. Scipio showed enormous creativity in every facet of warfare he participated in and never seemed to be caught off guard by absolutely anything\u2026but Hannibal couldn\u2019t account for Scipio using the same exact cavalry encirclement that Hannibal used to help kill tens of thousands of Romans around Scipio when he was younger? Hannibal didn\u2019t just lose to Scipio; he was beaten by Scipio. Hannibal knew he had the inferior cavalry at Zama because Scipio had strategically secured the loyalty of that cavalry away from Carthage, and that was after they helped kill Scipio\u2019s father and uncle. But Hannibal is not the first person in history to face that problem and the fact they he couldn\u2019t adapt to it is evidence of inferior generalship that is simply ignored by his proponents. He could have used his elephants to scatter the Roman cavalry before charging with his own, or dug defensive trenches and held his cavalry in a defensive position to secure the flanks of his infantry\u2026but he used them like everyone else he had defeated. He charged his elephants at the bulk of the Roman army, having not anticipated that they would have an answer for that\u2026despite Rome having learned how to defend against elephants by their third encounter with Phyrrus, who was likely an influence of Hannibal\u2019s. Was Hannibal a great general? Yes. Was he better than the man who beat him? No. Hannibal was mostly just really good at executing a small set of tactical maneuvers that were designed to defeat a standard Roman army. He came across a Roman who arranged his army in an unconventional way; was conquered by same. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that there is some truth to what you are saying. There is no doubt that Hannibal was an extremely able general and when he invaded Italy the Romans had no military minds capable of dealing with him on the battlefield. Quintus Fabius Maximus was probably correct in advocating that Rome avoid confronting him on the battle field and try to starve his army out by denying them supplies. If Rome had continued this policy rather than confronting him at Cannae, he might have become discouraged after a year or two. At the time of the Battle of Cannae none of the Italian peoples, other than the Galls had aligned with Hannibal. After Cannae many of the tribes and polities of Southern Italy threw in their lot with Hannibal, making Fabius\u2019 strategy unfeasible. The Romans learned from Hannibal\u2019s tactics over time and their army became more and more like a professional force. Hannibal\u2019s best student among the Romans was Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus whose father was killed fighting the Carthaginians in Spain. At the battle of Zama both sides were fairly evenly matched, but Hannibal had the disadvantage that many of his troops were relatively untrained, while nearly all of Scipio\u2019s troops were highly trained. Scipio also had the advantage in Cavalry with his alliance with the Numidian King Massinissa. Scipio succeeded in neutralizing the threat from Hannibal\u2019s elephants, and it was his advantage in cavalry that ultimately carried the day. The question that is often asked is why Hannibal didn\u2019t besiege Rome after his huge victory at Cannae. He may have expected Rome to sue for peace. He also may have worried that he didn\u2019t have siege machinery and that he would not have been able to maintain his army for the months that a siege might have required. I think that if Hannibal had mobilized his new allies after Cannae and had established food supplies and obtained siege machinery, he might have successfully besieged Rome. We will never know. To paraphrase Hannibal\u2019s cavalry chieftain, Maharbal, Hannibal knew perfectly well how to win a battle, he didn\u2019t know how to win a war. ",

            "answer_text": "Hannibal managed the following: He crossed Spain, the south of France, and the Alps and managed to keep his army cohesive and ready to fightHe not only defeated but obliterated a succession of Roman armies on their own territoryHe instilled such fear that the Romans wouldn\u2019t even engage him directly afterwardsHe managed to keep a fighting force going, in enemy territory, without regular reinforcements or resupply for 15 years.While it is true that his greatest victory (Cannae) was greatly assisted by the poor decisions of the two Roman consuls on the scene, as well as the Roman system that prevented one man from taking full command, he still beat the Romans more thoroughly than any other commander ever had or ever would. Rather than giving Hannibal too much credit, history probably doesn\u2019t give Scipio Africanus enough. He realized that the way to beat Hannibal was to attack Carthage where Hannibal wasn\u2019t. He also won a great political victory in convincing the leader of the Numidians, Masinissa, to switch sides. Numidian cavalry had been key in Hannibal\u2019s early victories, and would be instrumental in Scipio\u2019s defeat of Hannibal at Zama. ",

            "answer_text": "The question as written: Am I the only one that thinks Hannibal Barca is not as good as everyone says he is? His main victories were against politicians playing soldiers when he faced a proper general it was catastrophic defeat. Whoa whoa whoa! You\u2019re making a critical mistake: Rome\u2019s politicians were soldiers and generals. It is the complete opposite of what we have today where few of our leaders have served in the military (a relatively recent phenomenon). We recognize that Rome\u2019s generals were also politicians, but one thing we\u2019ve forgotten is that all of Rome\u2019s politicians had officer experience in the military. Rome\u2019s senators were expected to have served in 10 annual military campaigns. At the pinnacle of the Senate were the two consuls. These men were charged with handling the state\u2019s most pressing problems, which inevitably meant leading Rome\u2019s wars. In a true SHTF moment, the Senate elected the Dictator, a single man elected by the consuls to serve for six months, to focus military power to defeat the threat. These weren\u2019t men \u201cplaying soldiers,\u201d they were soldiers. This merging of political and military is best represented by the scene after the battle of Cannae when Mago Barca, Hannibal\u2019s brother, entered the Carthaginian Senate with a sack and dumped hundreds of gold rings on the floor, each taken from a Roman equites killed at Cannae. At that battle as many as a third of Rome\u2019s senators had died. Scipio was brilliant, there\u2019s no doubt. But his brilliance was in taking the battle to Carthage, a strategy that put him under considerable pressure from the Senate which viewed his leaving Italy while Hannibal was still on the peninsula as borderline treasonous. It would also contribute to his unpopularity in the Senate and eventual downfall.  Show Hannibal Some Love Hannibal had an army composed of mercenaries from several different areas that didn\u2019t even share the same language. He was a master tactician who marched through Spain, using his hatred of Rome as a unifying force to rally the Spanish and Gauls. He crossed the Alps - an act believed impossible, and was outnumbered in every battle, sometimes by as many as 5 to 1. And he almost took Rome. His only mistake? For all of his loathing for all-things Roman, he failed to understand his enemy. He expected to defeat Rome in battle and have them capitulate, the way of the Greek world at the time. The problem is the Romans wouldn\u2019t quit. The Romans refused to capitulate - which went beyond the norms of war at the time. The Romans viewed each war they fought as a fight to the death. Either Rome would be victorious or Rome would die. They didn\u2019t quit after the disasters of the Spanish campaign. They didn\u2019t quit after Ticinus. They didn\u2019t quit after Trebia. They didn\u2019t quit after Lake Trasimene. And they didn\u2019t quit after Cannae. This is the fundamental reason why Rome rose to glory and Carthage was relegated to obscurity. Both Hannibal and Scipio Africanus were brilliant generals. Deciding which was best is like choosing between chocolate and vanilla ice cream, or between dogs and cats. Both men had their strengths, and both had their weaknesses. But choosing between them is impossible. We can only thank (our curse) Fate for giving us the antidote to Hannibal in the form of Scipio Africanus because only an extraordinary general could defeat another extraordinary general. ",
