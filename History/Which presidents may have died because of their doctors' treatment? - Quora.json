            "answer_text": "The two names that spring immediately to mind are George Washington and James Garfield, though there is a lot of debate on the issue. Washington was bled an excessive amount of blood, in the hope that bleeding him might improve his sore throat. No one gets bled as a medical treatment anymore, but there is some speculation that Washington might have had a severe infection that nothing available at the time could have cured. But the bleeding certainly did not help. (I should point out that Washington died after he left office. I do not not mean to imply Washington died while in office.) Garfield was shot and lived for two and a half months after he was shot. If his physicians had left him alone and had not kept trying to remove the bullet he might have lived a lot longer. On the other hand, some historians believe the bullet did enough damage to eventually kill Garfield no matter what the doctors did. . ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to Washington and Garfield, definitely William McKinley Admittedly, McKinley was shot, but his physicians made an ill advised attempt to remove the bullet from his body. They had the \u201cassistance\u201d of Alexander Graham Bell (yes, the telephone guy) who was also at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo and was demonstrating his new metal detector. Unfortunately, the detector wasn\u2019t very good and it was likely just detecting metal in the table McKinley was put on rather than the bullet. They dug into him to no avail before giving up. McKinley seemed to be doing well for a few days, but then took a turn for the worse. Similarly, Lincoln was badly wounded by the bullet, but his physicians again panicked and tried to get it out of him. That might have been a contributing factor in his death. ",
