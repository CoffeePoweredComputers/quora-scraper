            "answer_text": "In my mind there's no question that Henry II was a better king. Like Trump, he still accomplished a lot despite tremendous opposition from his French rival, King LouisVII, the two revolts of his rebellious son Co-Monarch Young Henry, his disloyal wife Eleanore of Aquitane, and his own foolish libido that drove him into the arms of his lover Rosamund Clifford. Despite all this, he reinvigorated the English economy, laid down the basics of English Common Law, dismantled the fortress castles of most of the insurgent Barons, and sought to tame the powerful Church by appointing his agent, the Chancellor Thomas Becket as the Archbishop of Canterbury. Henry was successful in taking the courts away from Church religious rule and making them civil courts but he failed to recognize the depth of Becket's faith. Becket became an ardent defender of the Church, becoming a real wrench in Henry's plans. In dismay, Henry may have muttered: \"Can someone rid me of this turbulent Priest ( Becket)?\"These words were misinterpreted by four dumb knights who murdered Thomas Becket in front of the church Altar in Canterbury Cathedral sending Shockwaves through Europe and besmirching Henry's reputation as a good king. But HENRY II 's great grandfather William the Conqueror was born in 1028 to an unmarried French woman and the Duke of Normandy. Taunted as William the Bastard this child became one of England's most brutal and influential kings.His father dies when he was only eight but immediately he had to fight adult rivals who wanted to take his title away. By the time he was twenty, now a tall and steely warrior, his own cousin rebelled against his rule . William ruthlessly punished the rebels by cutting off their hands and feet. Now the King of England, Edward the Confessor was a distant cousin and friend of young William and led William to believe he would name William as heir to the British throne. And then William met Harold Godwinson, an English nobleman who was Edward's right hand man. The two became best friends with Harold promising to help William attain the British throne But when Edward the childless Confessor lay on his death bed he named HAROLD GODWINSON as his heir and Harold coronated himself early the next morning. BETRAYED!!! And by a former friend, William sailed for England with seven hundred ships and defeats Harold at the Battle of Hastings, bringing French rule, culture, language, slaughter and starvation to the land. He installs a Norman aristocracy but Northern England rejects his rule so he burns their villages and farmlands, forcing them to merge with the south into one unified kingdom and England doesn't get an actual ENGLISH KING for the next 300 years. Over 100,000 people die at William's hand. So who was a better king? I'll let you decide. ",

            "answer_text": "Without William, there\u2019d be no Norman England to build the Angevin empire on. Henry II was good at political strategy: the way he built his empire by strategic alliances was outstanding. Unfortunately, both men had trouble with sons, and their sons with each other. William with his eldest, Robert Curthose. Henry with all of his sons. As to administrative innovations, both kings employed very capable men. William\u2019s entourage was truly stellar: whatever you think of their actions, there\u2019s no doubting the capacities of Abbot Baldwin, Archbishop Lanfranc, Bishop Odo of Bayeux, Count Alan Rufus, Abbot Scolland, Archbishop Thomas, Bishop William of Durham, Ranulf Flambard, and countless others promoted by William who reshaped England in so many ways during and after his reign. Henry II\u2019s notoriously loose lips caused the murder of one of his most capable advisors, Archbishop Thomas a\u2019Beckett. William I had more respect for his counsellors. Alan Rufus and his family trained successive generations of wise courtiers. For instance, his great-nephew William de Tancarville trained and knighted Sir William Marshal, the man who did most to temper the follies of King John. Some of Alan Rufus\u2019s Bretons migrated north during the reign of King David I of Scotland where they and their allies rose to prominence. For example, another of King John\u2019s better advisers was Alan of Galloway, a descendant of the Earl Gospatric of Cumbria and Northumbria who had been exiled to Scotland by William the Conqueror.
