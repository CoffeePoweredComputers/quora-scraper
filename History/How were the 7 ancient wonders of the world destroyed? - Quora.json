Centuries or millennia later another Earthquake triggered a tsunami on July 21, 365AD. This event wiped out what was left, and flooded the rest of old Alexandria. This Earthquake was centered on Crete was not the first or last for this area either. Earthquakes are blamed for wiping out most of the ancient cities and structures from Rome and Etrusca to Greece and Persia. 6. The Colossus of Rhodes was lost in the same time Period, due again to earthquakes, and rising sea levels. 5. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are a mythical construct based on the actual Hanging Gardens at Ninevah, Assyria. However the Neo-Assyrian Kings called this place Babylon, just like how the Caliphs called Cairo, Babylon until the 1700\u2019s. In the ancient Sumerian language Babylon literally translates to \u201cGates of Heaven\u201d or \u201cHouse of Enlil\u201d. This place is still there, East of Ninevah, it looks just like a hill covered in sand and soil. The problem is there are so many Ruins Sites known as Tells, that it can be hard to pick which one was which. 4. The temple of Artemis was destroyed and rebuilt numerous times. It was remarked at the birth of Alexander, that Artemis was too concerned by his birth to extinguish her own burning temple. The third temple was closed by Christian Authorities and slowly deconstructed over a period of 500 years. The Hagia Sophia was constructed with a large amount of granite and marbled quarried from this site. The columns were moved to a variety of sites including the Vatican in Rome and Istanbul. 3. The Masoleum of Helicarnasas was impressive and was another example of loss by earthquake. The impressive pile of marble debris was later picked over by nearly every peasant that could carry away rocks. During the ottoman Period the site was lost and overgrown, and was not rediscovered until 1852 by the British Consulate Officials. 2. The statue of Zues at Olympia was also destroyed by Romans, but the remains are unknown, as they were carried away. The location has been identified as well as the \u201cWorkshop of Phidas\u201d. Several strange stories are told including that of Caligula ordering the head removed. An earthquake collapsed the scaffolding which caused a sound similar to laughter and the site was abandoned. Caligula dies soon thereafter. Lucian of Samosata recalls the Statue being carried away, before 200BC. 1. The great Pyramid is still there, with much of its\u2019 fascade removed. Again another example of people from outside the country coming in and building cities to dominate the locals. Most of old Cairo and the Giza neighborhoods are built from the limestone casing stones stripped from the site. ",
