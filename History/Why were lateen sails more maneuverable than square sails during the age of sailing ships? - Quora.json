            "answer_text": "Manoeuvrability depends on many factors. A short ship with most of its mass toward the center will turn quicker and more easily than a long ship with its weight concentrated in the bow and stern. On the other hand the former ship will also pitch a lot more in a violent sea compared to the long ship with weight at its ends. When turning the forces on the ships bow and stern also affect how well it does this. On a typical square rig of the 15th or 16th century there is a small square sail suspended from the bowsprit called the spritsail (or artemon) and a lateen sail close to the stern (sometimes called counter-artemon)   These two sails sit at the very ends of the ship and the center around which it turns thus they can assist in turning. Because they are nearly in line with the keel the wind exerts a lot of lateral force on the ships ends; the bowsprit is inclined to make the bow turn away from the wind while the lateen mizzen will push the bow into the wind. For the record, the crew notes that to sail the above ship they rarely use the mizzen because the ship is naturally weatherly and does well to windward using just the fore and mainmast square sails. Bringing in all sails is just what they do to look cool when there is a photoshoot. As for manoeuvrability of the sails I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say the lateen is that more manoeuvrable than a square sail. You use a relatively long yard on a short mast which requires quite a bit of effort to hoist it up. To furl up the sail requires climbing along an incline yard, incidentally the upper part of the yard is also the most likely part to suffer from catastrophic failure.  Because part of the yard sits before the mast tacking requires quite a bit of effort. The sail will have to be slackened along with the parrel holding the yard. The foot of the yard then has to be brought toward the mast to a near horizontal point and brought to the other side. Furthermore you only have tensioned stays on the windward side because those on the lee would interfere. This means that you have to mess with stays on every tack.  For lack of bonnets, reef points or brails you\u2019ll have to bring down the yard and bend on a smaller sail if you want to reduce the sail area. Of course all of this is still manageable at the size shown in the photos above. The problem is that unlike a square sail you cannot simply stack many smaller lateen sails on top of each other. You\u2019re limited to only a single lateen sail PER mast and since the number of masts is limited by the length of your ship you can only increase the canvas area by making that single lateen sail per mast bigger. As you do that the downsides start to become ever more evident. There is a limit imposed not just by natural materials such as wood, hemp and canvas but also a limit to the size of a sail a human crew can handle. In the 13th century the Italian city states seem to have come close to this limit. They had huge 1000 ton three deckers with two or three large lateen sails. At this point you start seeing two quarter rudders weighing up to 11 tons each and yards 45 meters in length and weighing 7 metric tons. Hoisting and lowering these can\u2019t have been a quick affair, climbing aloft was not for the faint of heart and tacking with these was downright dangerous. As the storm waxed fiercer the sailors wanted to gybe the mainsail, and the yard was already raised up above the top ' of the mast, with the accaton furled round it, but when they let the yard fly round on the other side, the sail came loose, and fell upon the oars on that side. As the wind now suddenly filled the sail, and was raising it up with great force, it stuck among the oars, and the ship leaned over so much to that side that the yard itself touched the water, and the mast, and, indeed, the galley herself, threatened to go over on that side. Besides these misfortunes another great one befell us, for that same night, while the officers of the ship were engaged in managing the sails and tackling of the galley, all of a sudden a block fell from the masthead, which struck and killed our best officer, a man whose slightest sign was obeyed by all the sailors and galley-slaves.  A later description from one of the late 15th century Merchant galleys which used lateen sails has come down to us. But while it was yet dark, and no stars could be seen, as we tacked to windward there arose a most frightful storm, and a terrible disturbance of the sea and air. Most furious winds tossed us aloft, lightning flashed, thunder roared dreadfully ; moreover, on either side of us fearful thunderbolts fell, so that in many places the sea seemed to be on fire. The rain, too, fell in such torrents as though entire rain-clouds had burst and fallen upon us. Violent squalls kept striking the galley, covering it with water, and beating upon the sides of it as hard as though great stones from some high mountains were sent flying along the planks. I have often wondered when at sea in storms how it can be that water, being as it is a thin, soft and weak body, can strike such hard blows against whatever it meets, for it makes a noise when it runs against the ship as though millstones were being flung against her ; and one cannot wonder at its breaking up a ship even though she were built of iron. Waves of sea-water are more vehement, more noisy, and more wonderful than those of other water. I have had great pleasure in sitting or standing on the upper deck during a storm, and watching the marvellous succession of gusts of wind and the frightful rush of the waters. Storms are endurable by day, but at night they are too cruel, especially when they are violent ones like that of which I am now speaking: for this was a very fierce storm, and the darkness was intense, nor was there any light save the continual flashes of lightning. So fierce a wind kept tossing the galley up and down, rolling it from side to side and shaking it about, that no man could lie in his berth, much less sit, and least of all stand. We were obliged to hang on to the pillars which stood in the middle of the cabin supporting the upper works, or else to crouch on our bended knees beside our chests, embracing them with our hands and arms, and so holding ourselves still ; and while doing so, sometimes big heavy chests would be upset, together with the men who were clinging to them. For the galley moves so violently, and in such different directions, that it upsets everything that stands, and, which sounds miraculous but is perfectly true, even things which were hanging up against the bulk-heads came off their hooks and fell down. Although the ship was everywhere dressed with pitch and the other things which are used to prevent leakage and to keep out the water, yet during this storm the water came in through unsuspected leaks everywhere, so that there was nothing in the whole ship which was not wet ; our beds and all our things were sopping, our bread and biscuit all spoiled by the sea water. On the lower deck was terror and misery ; on the upper deck toil and trouble. The wind blew our mainsail all to pieces, so the sailors lowered the yard, and bent to it another sail, for use in storms, which they call 'papafigo'; but after they had hoisted up the yard with the sail furled along it, while the sailors were sitting along the yard letting the ties go, and the sail was falling down, and the sailors on deck were holding in their hands the 'polistrelum,' that is, the rope by which the lower corners of the sail are held, all the wind rushed into the sail and filled it with such force that it tore the sheet out of the hands of the sailors, and blew it and the sail itself above the mast-head and above the ' keba,' or ' top,' high into the air : and it blew out so strongly in the wind that the yard bent like a bow, and the very mast itself, although it was big and strong, formed of many beams fastened together, creaked loudly as though it was already split and broken. At this time we were in the greatest danger, for had the mast broken during such a storm, we should soon have been overwhelmed by the sea, galley and all. As a bird cannot fly without its feathers and wings, even so a ship of the greatest burthen cannot move without sails, which are its wings and feathers. So when the poets speak of winged horses, they merely mean ships, as, for instance, Perseus came from Greece on a winged horse, and saved Andromeda from the rock at Joppa, etc. So our mast made many dreadful noises, and the yard likewise ; and every joint in the whole galley seemed to be coming to pieces. Nothing ever frightened me in storms so much as the loud groans of the ship, which are so intense that one thinks that the ship must be broken somewhere. Nor can a man refrain from crying out, because of the sudden and dreadful noise of these groans. So there we stood, beholding a sad sight and in imminent danger. As the sail flapped thus in the air, the galley-slaves and other sailors ran to and fro with as much noise and shouting as though they were just about to be run through with swords; some climbed up the shrouds on to the yard, and tried to draw the sail down to them ; some on deck below ran about trying to catch hold of the sheet again ; some rove ropes through blocks and put brails round the sail. Meanwhile the pilgrims and those who were useless at this work prayed to God and called upon the saints. Some made their confessions as though already at the very point of death ; some made great vows that they would travel from hence to Rome, to St. James (at Compostella), or to the house of the Blessed Virgin (at Loretto), if only they might escape from this death ; for it is only when death is present before our eyes that we fear it. I thought of the aphorisms of Anacharsis the philosopher, who said that those who are at sea cannot be counted among either the living or the dead. Moreover, he said that they were only removed from death by the space of four fingers, four fingers being the thickness of the sides of a ship. Also, when asked which ships were the safest, he replied : 'Those which lie on dry ground, and not in the sea,' declaring that there was no safety at sea, because of its numerous and sudden perils. - Felix Fabri 1480 AD. A square sail by contrast was much more manoeuvrable if scaled up. It could easily be reefed with reef points or a bonnet, once sailors learned to keep the yard hoisted up permanently they saved themselves a lot of trouble and tacking simply requires a couple of lines to be handled from deck. On a medieval cog it would be possible to simply wind the yard roped round a capstan and brace the yard around with little effort. For these reasons and their seaworthiness Italians started copying northern square sail ships around 1300. Their addition was that of a mizzen lateen sail for enhanced turning and keeping to windward. I am not actually sure how much higher a purely lateen rigged vessel could point compared to a ship with a single square sail. Some modern replicas managed to get close to 59\u201361 degrees of the wind while lateens only point slightly higher at 51 to 56 degrees of the wind. ",

            "answer_text": "Square sails work like parachutes. They create drag by being perpendicular to the wind. That drag is transferred to the ship & makes it move in the water. Thus it is lousy at sailing into the wind. A square sail can only tack into the wind at 67 degrees 5 minutes of angle.  Lateen sails work like airplane wings. They can face into the wind at 56 degrees 25 MOA. The wind deflects off the sail & transfers energy to the ship thus making it move.  What is the purpose of the lateen sail on the mizzenmast of a galleon? ",
