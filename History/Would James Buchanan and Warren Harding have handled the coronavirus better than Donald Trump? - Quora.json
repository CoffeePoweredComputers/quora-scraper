            "answer_text": "Hard to know that! Times and science have changed! Vaccines were more or less non existent until the 1919 influenza epidemic. Though I cannot remember the book but historically it tells how scientist were spurred on by this outbreak and how vaccines were developed. If science were more available to those presidents then it would be more likely than not they would have consulted and found a way to deal with epidemics. Undoubtedly anyone would be better than Trump to deal with such an outrageous break. He has had so much potential available and like everything else he touches-dies. Trump, even though exposed to the virus, has refused testing. It would be ironic if he became infected and age 73 probably would not do well! ",

He's better than Trump too. Unfortunately, he's not much better AND he's essentially a mannequin under Trump at present, so his D+ capacity to do the right thing is suppressed. ",
