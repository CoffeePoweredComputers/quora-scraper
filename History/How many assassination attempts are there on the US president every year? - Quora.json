            "answer_text": "It is very hard to categorize threats and assassination attempts. Opportunity is often the biggest indicator or concern. For that very reason the United States Secret Service and the Presidential Protection Detail support personnel interview almost everyone of those crazy enough to threaten the President of the United States. There are literally thousands of threats for each President of the United States to be evaluated each year.[1] Most are just bluster, but you just never know. There varies between one and ten instances a year when a person or group of persons actually plan and secure materials for an assassinatiin attempt. There are many John Hinkleys out there that are looking to make a name for themselves, or at least go out in a blaze of glory if all else fails. It just takes one plot to get it right, no matter how many times they are stopped in other attempts. Sometimes there just isn't a good way to put a president at an event and hide/secure him at the same time. In those cases (if they can't talk the staff out of the event) risk reduction is put into place as much as possible. I have been standing by the President of the United States out in the open, basically in the the back of your mind you are hoping a would be assassin is a bad shot and everyone can take cover. However, we all know that sometimes those that are the most crazy also have plenty of opportunity to practice and prepare for an attempt. There are 40 million to 75 million rifles in the United States of America that can be used as a sniper rifle. The differences in a good scoped hunting rifle and a sniper rifle are all but nonexistent, for many years the American military sniper rifle was a redressed model 700 Remington, and many American hunting rifles were simply scoped 1903-A3 military surplus rifles. (Lee Harvey Lee Harvey Oswald used an absolute POS Italian surplus WWII rifle he bought for under $20 including the scope, to assassinate President Kennedy.) There are also probably in excess of 40 million people who can routinely make the shot at 400 yards or less. And another 5 to 10 million that can make the shot at 800 yards or more. There are even plenty that can make it at 1,500 yards. Bombs and poisons are harder to pull off, we have some very good preventative measures in place. But it can still be done by someone smart enough and determined enough. (John Hinkley had already stalked President Carter with his pistol on two occasions trying to assassinate him, before he successfully shot President Reagan.)
