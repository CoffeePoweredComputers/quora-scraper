            "answer_text": "Well I think this is an excellent opportunity to cite Adam Smith: First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workman necessarily increases the quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of labour, by reducing every man's business to some one simple operation, and by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily increased very much dexterity of the workman. A common smith, who, though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to make nails, if upon some particular occasion he is obliged to attempt it, will scarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred nails in a day, and those too very bad ones. A smith who has been accustomed to make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a nailer, can seldom with his utmost diligence make more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several boys under twenty years of age who had never exercised any other trade but that of making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same person blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion, heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head too he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into which the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of them much more simple, and the dexterity of the person, of whose life it has been the sole business to perform them, is usually much greater. The rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufacturers are performed, exceeds what the human hand could, by those who had never seen them, be supposed capable of acquiring. This was written in the late 18th century but it must have been no different in Roman times as it was then. In a small village the local blacksmith could produce a pair for you while the larger cities had smiths just dedicated to making nails. Keep in mind they were a fair bit bigger back in the day and used less when timber framing or other carpentry tricks were available.    ",

            "answer_text": "Blacksmiths used to make nails, in fact specialist craftsmen who made them were once called \"nailsmiths\" and served an important purpose. In those days nails were incredibly expensive and carpenters avoided their use through timber framing, which used large wood beams held together using woodworking joints instead of fasteners like nails or screws. Cheap, round \"wire nails\" came in the mid 1800s and from there modern dwellings, made of smaller boards nailed together, began to overtake old timber framed buildings. Flat nails are still used for some things today, though they're also made in factories. ",
