            "answer_text": "Actually only Pakistani Erdogan fanboys hate on Atat\u00fcrk. Because Erdogan hates secularism. Arabs primarily hate on the Ottoman Empire, claiming that the Ottomans turned the Arabian peninsula into an Ottoman colony. Even Assad recently claimed that the Turkish army being in Syria is basically Erdogan rebuilding the Ottoman Empire. The hatred towards Atat\u00fcrk within Turkey primarily stems from the 1980s coup. Where the Turkish military tried to force people to \u201clike\u201d Atat\u00fcrk. Which as you can see didn\u2019t work. Most of this hatred however is based on fiction rather than facts. The general who took over Turkey also did other things that made the Islamists hate him, like banning the headscarf in public institutions. Since most Islamists in Turkey are uneducated, they think that this ban was put there by Atat\u00fcrk. Not realizing that even Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s wife had a headscarf. Atat\u00fcrk never forbade the headscarf. The Islamists in Turkey literally came up with an alternative history to justify their hatred. Like claiming that Atat\u00fcrk was born in Malatya instead of Selanik (Thessaloniki). Claiming that his mother was a prostitute, which she wasn\u2019t. Claiming that his father was unknown, even though his father is known (his father is Ali R\u0131za Efendi). Claiming that the Treaty of Lausanne wasn\u2019t that good. And they\u2019ve came up with a lot more ridiculous bullshit to justify their hate. They even claim that ghosts/jinns (genies) protected Turkey during the Gallipoli Campaign, because the Turks were super religious, instead of giving Atat\u00fcrk credit for his military strategies. On top of that the Turkish population was superstitious back then not super religious, mainly because they couldn\u2019t read or write. And their religion was primarily based on what they were told, not what they read if they could read. Within the last 100 years much hasn\u2019t changed though. There are even pseudo-historians in Turkey who are worshipped by Islamists for all their false claims. And Erdogan was good friends with one of them who recently died. That guy was declared insane and treated in a clinic a couple of decades ago. He said, \u201cI wished the Greeks had won Turkey\u2019s war of independence\u201d. Erdogan hates Atat\u00fcrk so much, that in history lessons about Turkey\u2019s war of independence, the name Atat\u00fcrk is removed. That is like removing Napoleon\u2019s name from the Napoleonic Wars. And Erdogan\u2019s picture is placed in places where you previously only had Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s picture. On top of that at some places Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s paintings were deliberately removed like at the Turkish parliament without an explanation. You can compare Erdogan\u2019s hatred towards Atat\u00fcrk to Trump\u2019s hatred towards Obama. The only difference is, Atat\u00fcrk died 17 years before Erdogan was even born. You can compare this hatred with an American president hating and comparing himself to the Fouding Fathers. Can you even imagine how ridiculous that is? Historically however Atat\u00fcrk did inspire leaders in the Middle East to also have an independent and modern nation, instead of being a puppet state runned by French and British imperialists. For example, Gamal Abdel Nasser from Egypt. One of the thing she did was nationalising the Suez Canal. Reza Shah from Iran was also inspired by Atat\u00fcrk, trying to modernize and secularize his country like Atat\u00fcrk. But he faced a lot more internal resistance from Islamists. Atat\u00fcrk is also respected in Azerbaijan, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and Turkic countries in Central Asia (like Kazakhstan). ",

            "answer_text": "Well, this is among ultra conservative Turks, conservative Sunnis from places like Jordan, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan. They believe that fault him for dissolving the Ottoman Empire and founding a republic and then he got rid of the Ottoman script, which was modeled after the Perso-Arabic script, and replaced it with Latin. Many conservative Muslims, including some Turks, believe it was done to distance the people of the new republic from the Arabs and others who were formerly part of the Ottoman Empire and align Turkey more with the West. Anyway, what Ataturk intended to do has partially succeeded, but not completely as we can see from the current leadership in Turkey. However, that leadership is having a difficult time because of decades of Ataturk type programs have changed Turkish culture and heavily aligned Turkey economically and culturally to the West, and going far from that is causing havoc with Turkey\u2019s economy. Of course, if you\u2019re a very secular Turk, you might say that much of the Arab world isn\u2019t as industrial and advanced as Turkey, in general. Of course, conservative Turks and Arabs will say that so much of Turkey\u2019s progress has come from the AKP and President Erdogan, but 90% of that already came from the governments before that. There were definitely good projects that were executed by this current government, but Turkey was already advanced in many ways and was long considered part of the OECD and a developing country on the way to becoming developed even during Turgut Ozal\u2019s days. Also, secular Turks cherish personal freedoms and are often irreligious and openly so, but one cannot do that in Arab world. They don\u2019t want to be associated with the conservatism of the Arab world and don\u2019t want to see their country become increasingly conservative and, as I said, they associate conservative ways with the Arab world and Middle East, but conservative Muslims don\u2019t think that way. They believe Turks should rightfully to take up the mantle of Islam again like in the days of the Caliphate and that Ataturk took the Turks away from that. Anyway, I explained why some Muslims think that way. I don\u2019t think there is any need to insult people whether Arabs or Turks or any figures. I think people should try to be respectful. ",
