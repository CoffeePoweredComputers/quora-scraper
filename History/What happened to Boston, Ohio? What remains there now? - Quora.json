            "answer_text": "Boston Mills - Hell Town Hell Town \u2013 a dark, foreboding place where ghosts, cults, and serial killers lurk. An entire town, cursed and frighteningly dangerous after dark. Of course we were intrigued, so we visited Hell Town. You may be surprised at what we found. LOCATION and HISTORY Hell Town is a nickname given to the northern part of Summit County. The areas most often associated with the Hell Town legends are Boston Township and Boston Village, as well as portions of Sagamore Hills and Northfield Center Townships. These areas are often combined into one large region, which is commonly referred to as Boston Mills. Settled in 1806, Boston stands as the oldest village in Summit County. The first mill was built in the village in the early 1820\u2019s. Several years later, the construction of the Ohio & Erie Canal brought more people to Boston, and over the next few decades mills began to flourish in the area \u2013 most notably a paper mill. When a railroad station was constructed in the town in the early 1880s, the station was named \"Boston Mills,\" in reference to the paper mill. In the late 1960s, a nationwide movement began that expressed concern over the destruction of our forests. In response, President Ford signed legislation in 1974 that enabled the National Park Services to purchase land and use it to create national parks. On December 27th, 1974, hundreds of acres of land, including some within the Township of Boston, were officially designated a National Recreation Area. Many people did not realize that this legislation gave the federal government the power to use the right of eminent domain to acquire land from private owners in order to clear the way for the national park, but almost immediately after the bill was passed, the government began purchasing houses throughout Boston Township and the surrounding area. Once the government decided to buy a property, there was no negotiation involved \u2013 the owners were forced to relocate. Residents began leaving in droves, and entire townships were swallowed up by the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. These events were so tragic that they were featured in the 1983 PBS documentary \"For the Good of All.\" Perhaps the general feelings of the displaced homeowners were best summed up in a statement found scrawled across the wall of a vacated home: \"Now we know how the Indians felt.\" ",

            "answer_text": "[PENINSULA, OHIO Helltown (Boston), Ohio The tragic reality of a town riddled with rumors of haunts, chemical spills, and serial killers. The abandoned village now colorfully known as \u201cHelltown\u201d is purportedly teeming with crybaby bridges, spooked school buses, mass human sacrifice scenes, and a mutant python for good measure. The extreme folklore surrounding the region formerly known as Boston, Ohio is ironic since the only verifiable legend about the town is that it is deserted for a very frighteningly tragic reason. Founded in 1806, Boston Village\u2019s original claim to fame was its standing as the oldest village in Summit County. Boston\u2019s relatively uneventful life took a turn for the worse in 1974 when it became the unlucky victim of nationwide anxiety over the country\u2019s disappearing forestland. Using the laws of eminent domain, President Gerald Ford signed a bill that gave the federal government\u2019s National Park Service jurisdiction to expropriate land for the establishment of National Parks. The NPS decided that Boston Township would be the new home for the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and began buying the properties of its longtime residents. The sentiment among citizens who had no choice but to leave their homes was expressed in a message scribbled on the wall of one of the houses: \u201cNow we know how the Indians felt.\u201d The empty homes were boarded up and adorned with U.S. \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs. The government quickly fell behind on its plan to create the park and the village sat neglected. The remaining buildings, remnants of a \u201cvanished\u201d town, have created a fertile soil for the innumerable urban legends that have popped up over the years. Update November 2016: All abandoned houses, etc. were torn down in the summer of 2016 and most of \u201cHelltown\u201d is now part of the national park nearby. There\u2019s nothing to see here anymore.] \u00a9 2016 Helltown, Ohio Atlas Obscura ",
