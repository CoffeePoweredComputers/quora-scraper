            "answer_text": "Why did people keep moving during the Great Human Migration? They were all looking for the highest mountain, the mountain of the Gods, from which an immense river was flowing to water a paradise. They were all looking for premordial paradise of humanity. Water and cold prevented them from advancing further in their quest to search for the lost paradise. They knew it existed for their ancestors died while looking for it but water and ice prevented them from locating it. The ancestors of the Europeans had more information as to the whereabouts of the paradise than the rest of the communities but the ice, cold and water prevented them from reaching it. My conclusion that the ancestors of the Europeans knew the whereabouts of the paradise is based on the work done by William Fairfield Warren and published in his book,\u201d Paradise found: The cradle of the human race at the North Pole\u201d. From this book, it is very clear that humanity's ancient paradise was located somewhere at the North Pole, even though, a polar paradise does not fit into the model of the earth with a polar ice cap. The failure of the polar paradise to fit in our currently accepted model of the earth, raises more questions than it answers but there is another model of the earth that give rise to more possibilities than the currently accepted model. The alternative model was proposed by Marshall B. Gardener. In 1913 and 1920, Marshall B. Gardener proposed that our planet is a spherical shell with openings to the interior region through the poles. This being the case, then you can understand why William Fairfield Warren traced humanity's lost paradise to the North Pole and why the ancestors of the Europeans migrated Northwards, a much more hostile environment. They could not do that without a strong driving force and there is no force that is stronger than a migrating group of people looking for a paradise of their ancestors. The ancestors of the Europeans were looking for that paradise but water and ice prevented them from venturing farther north. From our currently accepted model of the earth, a polar paradise is impossible. This may as well mean that the North Pole is just but a gateway to the land of paradise based on Marshall B Gardener's model. I am not going to explain much concerning Marshall B Gardener's model for I have done so elsewhere on my profile answers but I will leave references for further studies. If you consider it fictional, good and well, you are entitled to your freedom of conscience and opinion. To answer the question, Why did people keep moving during the Great Human Migration? They were looking for the premordial paradise that their ancestors died while looking for it. They never found it because it was located somewhere within the planetary shell and the only access are at poles. References.
