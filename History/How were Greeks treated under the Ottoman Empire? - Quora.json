            "answer_text": "Funny how the two answers given so far are from turkish people that are presenting a very romantic version of the ottoman times, as taught in turkish schools. What is conveniently not mentioned though is that in order for a non-turk to get such high places he had to be fully turkified, something that was happening at the age of 6\u20137 when he was forcibly taken by his parents. When somebody does not even know who his parents and his roots are, that has forgotten his language and culture, you cant say that he has been included in equal terms in the ottoman society. He is a turk, not a greek, and he is getting his position as a turk - so there is no equal, not even nice, treatment. The janisarries were established to humiliate conquered nations, not to intergate them into the ottoman society. Until the establishment of the ottomans in anatolia and the conquest of the byzantine capital, the ottomans were turkifying greek speaking populations by force. After 1453, as they were already established as a power and the priests basically surrendered them the city in exchange for benefits for the high ierarchy priests only, forced turkification were not as necessary, so they kept christians alive but used them as main source of taxes and as slaves, apart from the children abductions to serve as jannisaries, and women abductions to be prostitutes for the sultan at his court. Apart from very few greek people in the capital, that were still though in subject status and not equal citizens and occasionally slaughtered depending on how the rest of the subjects were \u201cbehaving\u201d, the rest, vast majority of greek people were suffering under ottoman rule, something that can be proven by the multiple uprisings against the ottomans, and the fact that very often they were supporting foreign powers like the venicians againtst the ottoman rule. Again, conveniently enough, this is nowhere mentioned in turkish school books. ",

            "answer_text": "Not easy to answer, because there were no 'Greeks'. From the East, Caucasus, till the end of Balkans, there were ethnicities of - ? - Hellenistic origin. Those in the far east, the Pontus Greeks, met Turkic people who later founded the Ottoman Empire already in the 10 century, whereas others did not even know about them two centuries later. The Turkic adoption of Turkey (Anatolia) and Greece was a slow process that lasted many centuries. During this time and also later, many Greeks converted to Islam and would consider themselves Turkish whereas I suspect that many of them did never give up their identity. One of my aunts spoke fluent - Pontus - Greek. Normally, non-Muslims would pay higher taxes, and until about the 17th century, one son of a family between the age 10 to 18 was taken by the state to be trained for the purposes of the Sultan. Most of them became Janissaries, many high rank officials. They could become the second man after the Sultan. The Turkish tradition does not know a nobility, i.e. to be noble by birth. Even a slave could become a vizier during his lifetime. The Greeks played a different role than most of the non-Muslim people in the Empire because the Sultan claimed to be the Emperor of Rome, and his church, the Greek Orthodox Church, played a major role in his politics. The Greeks on the islands did not feel much about a foreign rule. On most islands I have seen was not even a mosque built. Many admirals of the Ottomans who ruled the Mediterranean are said to be converted Greeks. But also those who did not belong to that group could get high positions. E.g., a man borne on the island Syros, the current capital of the xx , an island that is proud for never been occupied by the Ottomans, was a high rank general in the Turkish army. He is still popular because he, as a medic, would listen to the patients. People in Turkey still say 'Tell your trouble to Marko Pasha'. The most important role the Greeks played was the dragoman. A dragoman was an interpreter, translator, and official guide between Turkish, Arabic, and Persian-speaking countries and polities of the Middle East and European embassies, consulates, vice-consulates and trading posts. A dragoman had to have a knowledge of Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and European languages. It was their privilege. Thus, the ears and eyes of the Sultan were Greeks. But, these Greeks were those of Istanbul and vicinity. For them, those Greeks in Morea were something like the people of Dogpatch to Americans. They still don't like Greeks from Constantinople much who now have to live in Greece. They are called Byzantines - not a compliment. In general, the Greeks were treated such that they could preserve their religious and 'national' identity. In contrast to this, the Greeks on Cyprus were treated like slaves or dogs by the Latins (French) and sold to Venice together with their land. Their religion was suppressed. And even when the Ottomans were about to conquer Constantinople, they were asked to give up their identity and religion before receiving help. BTW, Athens was not conquered by the 'Turks' but sold them by a Venetian family. Altogether, the Sultan lost more soldiers and armies to conquer the tiny Albania than all the lands from Caucasus till there. At the end of its life, the capital of the Empire had a population with a non-Muslim majority, and the Greeks were the biggest part of it. Even after Turkey and Greece exchanged parts of their population, in Istanbul every seventh person was Greek by identity. Nobody really knows about the real proportion. The Turkish and Greek languages have around 1.500 to 3.000 words common. And cemetaries in Istanbul and Athens are decorated with the same trees. Thus, in the Ottoman Empire, the Greeks were no real 'aliens', but part of the society. ",
