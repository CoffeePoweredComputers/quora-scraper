Revolutionary war, though I do have to admit there is a question on if this was really America's victory or France's, their contribution was enormous.Chickamunga War, 1776-1795, fought concurrently with the Revolution against the Cherokee.The Quasi-War, which saw the end of the USA-France alliance and the conclusion of which ended French naval and privateer attacks on US shipping.First Barbary War, 1801-1805.War of 1812, which while militarily a stalemate, firmly established the USA as a nation in her own right and ended the ongoing harassment and raids against American shipping by Great Britain.Second Barbary War, 1815.Mexican-American war,which saw Mexico losing the war and being forced to recognize the California Republic and Republic of Texas as independant nations (even if they turned out to be short lived).American Civil War, you'll notice there is no Confederate States of America.Spanish American War, which ended with the collapse of the Spanish Empire.World War One, where US involvement came just in time to shore up the Allies after Russia's withdrawal from the war, freeing millions of Central Powers troops to slam into the tired and depleted forces of the Allies Powers.World War Two, where the USA was not only able to raise armies sufficient to fighting two separate wars across two separate oceans, but also the industrial strength to supply Britain, the Soviet Union, and her other allies with untold and nigh-uncountable tons of munitions, vehicles, and weapons.Gulf War (Desert Storm), where Iraq was completely routed and forced to abandon its attempt to annex Kuwait.The war with Afganistan. Afganistan's military, such as it was, lost control of the nation and has been a shadow of itself since.The war with Iraq: Iraq's conventional military, ranked at the time in the top 10 of military forces, was obliterated in less than a year and Iraq was occupied.So yes, the US military has won a few wars.

And then their are even smaller wars waged by various factions. It seems as though the smaller wars these days have a bigger impact. In terms of creating Refugees and basic human suffering. The US had participated in some rather big wars. We joined the Allies in World War 1. After Russia withdrew to begin its socialists experiment. We were able to tip victory in favor of the Allies. Who then screwed Germany and then paved the way for the Nazis. And we found ourselves in another Alliance fighting another World War. The US did the bulk of the fighting in the Pacific. We all but defeated Japan on our own. Before that we beat the British in the War for Independence. Of course the French helped us. You do know the French didn't agree to help the US until we won the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777. And that the French didn't formally recognize the US until February 1778. They didn't arrive with full strength until 1779. Still the Americans did a lot of the fighting because the French were not going to win the war for us. The War of 1812 was considered a disaster but it did have a purpose. While the US failed to capture Canada. The war ended in a stalemate. The US defeated Mexico and gained the South West, Texas and California. The Union won the Civil War. The US won the Spanish American war. The Korean war ended in a cease fire. But the US and its allies were able to prevent the North from taking over the entire peninsula. The US won the Persians Gulf war and rather decisively. We lost Vietnam but not in the field. Political and I guess you could say morally we lost that war. Somalia wasn't a war. The US and allies went in to aid the Somalians who apparently didn't want us there. They killed 18 Americans. We killed 500 of them. ",

            "answer_text": "Well we would never have been a nation without the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War. In the French and Indian War we were British Subjects and fought the French alongside the British Army and Navy. In fact in the attempted march and assault on Fort Duquesne at the Forks of the Ohio River, when the English Commander, General Edward Braddock was killed, it was George Washington who assumed command of the colonial troops to fight the French and Indians. Using 'Indian' style fighting techniques and tactics Washington and his 'Colonials' saved the routed English Army from destruction. In the Revolution we beat the Brits - the world's best trained and most professional Army and Navy in the world. We also beat the French in an undeclared War from 1798\u20131800. We fought the Brits again in 1812\u20131814. We lost some and won some including the Battle of New Orleans. There Andy Jackson, himself a veteran of the American Revolution and a bitter former prisoner of war under British tyranny, handed the British Army a resounding defeat. When we fought Mexico, our opponents were initially better trained and more numerous, but we beat them. The bloodiest war we ever had saw American killing American. It was the American Civil War and cost upwards of 750,000 dead and millions wounded. The US government, the Union, won. We destroyed the Spanish in the Carribean and the Phillipines and elsewhere in the Spanish American War. In World War I and in World War II not only did we fight with our own armies and naval formations under our own commanders, we also provided the wherewithal to our allies, including Russia in WW II, with which they fought. In WW II Dwight David Eisenhower was the Supreme Allied Commander. We won both of them. In Korea 1950\u201354 we fought the massive army of China and that of North Korea to a standstill. Ours was the largest contingent, by far, fighting under the UN flag to oppose the Communist Invasion of South Korea. In Vietnam we were outfoxed by the North Vietnamese government and their negotiators who basically lied. Yet we defeated the VC and NVA in every major engagement. In fact after Tet the VC was destroyed as any kind of effective fighting force. I believe they suffered casualties of 60%. In both Iraq and Afghanistan it was American blood, sinews and treasure that have driven ISIS and their ilk AROUND the world back on their heels. Of course our battles against the American Indian from the Wampanoags of Massachusetts, the Tsenacommacah Alliance of 30 Algonquin speaking tribes in Virginia, King Phillips War in the 1690's, the Wars of Red Cloud, Sitting Bull and the other Sioux, the Cheyenne Wars, the Comanche, the Seminole, the Blackhawks where Lincoln served, the Apaches and many other Native Tribes were sometimes our toughest and most vicious on both sides. Yeah we have plenty of wars under our belt both by ourselves and with Allies where we served as major players. We are damned good at it too. Aaaahhhhrrruuuugah !! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, the United States won the Mexican-American War by itself. I\u2019m assuming this war is considered a real war because this war lasted for almost 2 years, both sides had around 70,000 soldiers, and several thousand soldiers were killed on both sides. After prolonged border tensions, the war started when US soldiers were attacked in what was known as the Thorton Affair. The United States army was able to effectively sweep across, capturing important cities like Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico, Veracruz, and ultimately Mexico City. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the war and Mexico ceded some territories (now modern day Texas and parts of California). In return, the United States paid 15$ million in war damages. Now the California Republic helped in the war effort and it was not part of the United States. However the California Republic was made up of American immigrants who revolted against the Mexican government that controlled them. They were later incorporated into the United States shortly after the war began. In all, they were only an independent state for 25 days between declaring their independence from Mexico to being occupied by US troops. ",

The Union side won the War between the States, the confederacy surrendered unconditionally, but the surrender terms offered by the Unionists were very generous. (Officers could keep their sidearms, former confederate soldiers kept their horses and mules,etc). The USA clobbered the hell out of the plains Indians, regardless of Gen Custer\u2019s loss. in WW1, the Germans just gave up. In WW2 the USA (with a great deal of help from the allies) prevailed. The USA \u201cwon\u201d the Spanish-American war , and as a result, we have Puerto Rico, Guam, etc. The Korean War is still going on, there was never a peace treaty, only an agreement to quit fighting. In Vietnam, the USA prevailed in all the battles, but the Republic of Vietnam is history, regardless. I was in Iraq/Afghanistan for ten years as a civilian contractor. \u201cWinning\u201d is difficult to quantify. Saddam Hussein is dead and gone, and so is Osama Ben-Laden.

            "answer_text": "The term is vague in some ways. For one thing, many wars are fought between alliances of nations, so it is not that common to see a nation fight a war solo. In World War I, the US was considered an Allied Power, while it was an Allied Power in World War II. Some nations fight at higher percentages in alliances than others do. The US contributed ninety plus percent to the defeat of Japan, half to the defeat of Italy, while the USSR suffered the largest number of battle deaths against Germany. The US lost more airmen against Germany, and provided huge amounts of war material to the USSR, UK, and other nations. Nations also fight wars with economic and technological assistance from other countries, so that the UK defeated the Argentinians in 1982 during the Falklands War, but they did they did so with intelligence and technical help from the US. In other cases, volunteers from other countries may serve in the ranks of their military, so defining \u201cby itself\u201d is hard. - There are two wars that the US could readily be considered to have fought and won completely on its own without cooperating with another other nation: the Mexican War and Spanish-American War. The US had no allies in its war with Mexico, and the US decisively defeated Mexico in that war. The Spanish-American War saw a US campaign at sea and on land with no help from any other nations that saw the US strip Spain of Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. We could also put in the Philippine Insurrection, but one could also argue that it was a continuation of the Spanish-American War as Filipino rebels who were fighting Spain shifted from fighting Spain to fighting the US. The American Civil War was fought between American citizens, but one third of the country lost the war, while the other two-thirds did. We won/lost that war. Finally, the definition of war v. military action is problematic. The US has not officially been at war since September 2, 1945, when Japan surrendered after the December 7, 1941 Japanese attack and US declaration of War on December 8, 1941. The conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Iraq, and Syria have not been wars officially. ",

More realistically, it has still won quite a lot of them. Recent notable losses: Vietnam (which was a military victory, however we chose not to get involved again to enforce the peace treaty), the reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq are both still up in the air (the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were both successful, I'm separating them given the variance in the mission, objectives, and enemy forces). From the Korea War to the Gulf War, there are still plenty of victories even only counting convention wars. ",
