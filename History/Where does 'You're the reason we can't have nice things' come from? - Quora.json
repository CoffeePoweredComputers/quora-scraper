            "answer_text": "Kids are like wrecking balls and that's still an understatement I think, of course, most of us might not like to think of our children in terms of the things they have destroyed, but over the years it becomes apparent that no matter how beautiful you might think a white carpet is, no matter how plush and silky it might feel\u2026 the reality of having those things when there are small children in the house, means you get good at snipping rugs, that start off plushy and end up sticky and matted, often with substances unknown. And it isn't their fault that they can't eat ice cream without getting covered in the stuff, but these things happen and you get used to it, as a parent. I spent a small fortune once on a digital washing machine and the circuit board burnt out, perhaps because of little fingers switching the dial, I can't know for sure but I didn't pay more the next one, I stook with the cheaper washing machine just because i accepted that accidents are more likely to happen when the children are small. Its not a sentence that I would probably ever speak out loud, because it's accusing and is the same as saying \u201cyou are a house wrecker\u201d\u2026 and most parents value their kids happiness over domestic status symbols, any day of the week. But at the same time it is definitely true that some people continue into adulthood with the same lack of awareness that leaves light switches dirty from dirty hands and smudges on walls, and stains on tables that simply wouldn't be there \u201cbut for.. \u201c a messy person\u2026 Haha, I might be writing this like some organised immaculate person, but I am terrible also, especially when I'm busy doing things I enjoy, like painting or gardening, then the house can get easily messed up and untidy and that makes it impossible to chill out and relax in, for other people. So the origin of the saying probably comes from someone who is used to having to tidy up and clean a lot because they live with someone who doesn't. And if they are saying \u201cyou\u201d it means \u201cyou are messy or cause damage to stuff around you and that affects them, including their \u201cwill\u201d to invest in anything \u201cexpensive\u201d because based on their past experiences, enjoying new products doesn't last long. I wouldn't let it offend you though, it's more of a prompt to encourage you to be more mindful than you have been \u201cin the past\u201d so you can learn to be more appreciative of things that maybe you've not realised by yourself\u2026 or maybe they are just blaming you for stuff that wasn't well made and would of fallen to pieces If a mouse had tried leaning on it.
