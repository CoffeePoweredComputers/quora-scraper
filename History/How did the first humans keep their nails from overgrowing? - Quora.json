            "answer_text": "By \u201cfirst humans\u201d we may mean deeper archaic humanity, still in the genus Homo. Which extends back some 2 million years or so. In which case we can only infer from animal and some anthropological studies, really, as nails, like hair, don\u2019t often leave a fossil trace. At best we may get an impression, or we can interpret some bone attachment points as evidence for some sort of \u201cuse\u201d. In that sense we probably \u201cused\u201d nails a lot more, as tools, or as stiffening and support for our fingers and toes when going about our daily business. So wear and tear was \u201cnatural\u201d. We would have dug in our nails to peel fruits open, for example. And in a natural setting fruit was not domesticated, so skins were tougher. We also dug for starchy tubers, and a host of other \u201cuses\u201d, with or without other tools. Plus we had no shoes, of course, so just walking and running probably kept nails in check. If they got ragged, we probably bit them even again. It seems natural to do so, and other apes (and many modern humans) do that today. Unlike other clawed animals, we use our nails as support for softer tissue, to enhance fine grip and touch sensitivity. In the modern world we use what we have for pressing buttons or whatever, and don\u2019t \u201cuse\u201d them as we may have done in the deep past, or expose them to that sort of wear and tear. So we get a false impression of what they are, or how they may have grown and been \u201cmanaged\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "When involved in a lot of physical activity, one will often notice that the fingernails readily tear a sliver off at the tip if they are even a little long. Nails are intended to break away before they get too long. Also, we hear about people who habitually bite their nails. I suspect that this is one instinctive activity one finds in other animals. After all, I have watched my cats quietly grooming their nails, snipping off little bits of the tips (You find them here and there on the floor. It\u2019s one way cats use to keep their claws from getting too long.) I think it\u2019s not much of a leap to say that humans bite their nails to keep them from getting too long also. The human body \u2014 keeping its nails short by instinct. Who knew? But most likely true. ",

Many primates bite their nails. Some do not. It's not species specific. Chimpanzees, for example, usually bite their nails; some prefer to leave them alone. They do grow continuously and nails not kept trimmed probably break off (looking at the thickness of those nails, I get the impression that this might be rather painful if they break too short).  ",
