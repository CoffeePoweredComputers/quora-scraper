            "answer_text": "You probably never heard the word Porajmos. The genocide of the Romani and Sinti people has been so furious and cruel that it too has its own name, just like the Shoah.  When Hitler took power, in Germany lived several hundred black citizens, These were not enough to grant a genocide, but they were forcefully sterilized. The mentally disabled were sistematically killed. Polish and Russian people killed too: killed in their villages, deported for forced labor, or given vastly insufficient food rations so that they would starve to death. Homosexuals were deported in lagers and forced to have sex with female inmates as a mean to cure homosexuality (they were also starved, beaten, overworked, forced to endure extreme cold and sickness just like everyone else). Obviously political opposers (communists, socialists, democrats, liberals, catholics or other \u201cflavors\u201d of christians) were sent to lagers as well (the political inmates form the second largest group of people sent to lagers after the Jews, in some countries like Italy the number of the deported politicals is far superior to the racial deportees). On top of it, some 750,000 Italian militaries were interned as IMI (Italian Military Internees) ad basically treated more or less like the lager internees for refusing to fight for Mussolini and Hitler after Italy surrendered to the Allieds in 1943.

            "answer_text": "Two major categories sent to death camps were \u201csubversives\u201d and those who were not pulling their weight. Subversives included: Russians, communists, Jews, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, some Catholic priests and progressive Christians. The dead weight included: gypsies, the disabled, insane, criminals, Eastern Europeans. Death camps were for efficiency, to eliminate those hindering his strategy. He actually liked Arabs, Muslims, Italians, Southern Europeans & Japanese. He wanted to like the British & Americans, but gave up on them. Even Israeli terrorist Begin, a later Israeli prime minister, offered his services to Hitler to fight the British. Hitler wasn\u2019t quite sure how to respond. Hitler also liked blacks. None were in death camps. He congratulated Jesse Owens on his Olympic medals, while FDR snubbed Owens. In Germany Hitler allowed Owens to stay in white hotels, while FDR kept Owens away from white only hotels. Hitler appointed a Jew to head his atomic bomb research. While FDR sent the St. Louis back to Europe, with hundreds of Jews ready to be gassed. Who Hitler targeted had more to do with politics, national security and economic efficiency than with actual racism. He used racism for political purposes, but he wasn\u2019t quite that racist. He said he got his anti-semitism from Henry Ford & other Americans. Hitler himself may have been Jewish. He wasn\u2019t German. ",
