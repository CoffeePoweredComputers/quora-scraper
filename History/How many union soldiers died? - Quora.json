            "answer_text": "Firstly, can you be more specific? There are many things you could mean by this question. How many died in general? How many died in battle, or at a specific battle? I\u2019ll just give you a run down on total Union casualties. Approximately 110,000 Union Soldiers died due to battle-related causes during the Civil War. Around 250,000 died of disease. Yes, you were more likely to die of illness than on the battlefield. The deadliest battle for both sides was the infamous Battle of Gettysburg, totaling more than 50,000 casualties. ",

            "answer_text": "Battle deaths were Union 110K and Secesh 94K. There were about two camp deaths by disease for every combat death. For a long time the standard deaths in the ACW was given as 600K. Now they have found another 100K. With the secesh on the defensive and defensive technologies being dominant (mostly the rifled musket that was accurate out to as much as 500 yards), secesh battle prowess doesn\u2019t look so good. They should have been unbeatable and that was the prediction in Europe. The rebel armies mostly melted away as their families were starving. ",
