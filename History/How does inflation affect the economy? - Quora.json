            "answer_text": "Inflation affects different people differently. This is because of the fall in the value of money. When price rises or the value of money falls, some groups of the society gain, some lose and some stand in-between. Broadly speaking, there are two economic groups in every society, the fixed income group and the flexible income group. People belonging to the first group lose and those belonging to the second group gain. The reason is that the price movements in the case of different goods, services, assets, etc. are not uniform. When there is inflation, most prices are rising, but the rates of increase of individual prices differ much. Prices of some goods and services rise faster, of others slowly and of still others remain unchanged. We discuss below the effects of inflation on redistribution of income and wealth, production, and on the society as a whole. 1. Effects on Redistribution of Income and Wealth: There are two ways to measure the effects of inflation on the redistribution of income and wealth in a society. First, on the basis of the change in the real value of such factor incomes as wages, salaries, rents, interest, dividends and profits.Second, on the basis of the size distribution of income over time as a result of inflation, i.e. whether the incomes of the rich have increased and that of the middle and poor classes have declined with inflation. Inflation brings about shifts in the distribution of real income from those whose money incomes are relatively inflexible to those whose money incomes are relatively flexible.The poor and middle classes suffer because their wages and salaries are more or less fixed but the prices of commodities continue to rise. They become more impoverished. On the other hand, businessmen, industrialists, traders, real estate holders, speculators, and others with variable incomes gain during rising prices.The latter category of persons becomes rich at the cost of the former group. There is unjustified transfer of income and wealth from the poor to the rich. As a result, the rich roll in wealth and indulge in conspicuous consumption, while the poor and middle classes live in abject misery and poverty.But which income group of society gains or losses from inflation depends on who anticipates inflation and who does not. Those who correctly anticipate inflation, they can adjust their present earnings, buying, borrowing, and lending activities against the loss of income and wealth due to inflation.They, therefore, do not get hurt by the inflation. Failure to anticipate inflation correctly leads to redistribution of income and wealth. In practice, all persons are unable to anticipate and predict the rate of inflation correctly so that they cannot adjust their economic behaviour accordingly. As a result, some persons gain while others lose. The net result is redistribution of income and wealth.The effects of inflation on different groups of society are discussed below: (1) Debtors and Creditors: During periods of rising prices, debtors gain and creditors lose. When prices rise, the value of money falls. Though debtors return the same amount of money, but they pay less in terms of goods and services. This is because the value of money is less than when they borrowed the money. Thus the burden of the debt is reduced and debtors gain.On the other hand, creditors lose. Although they get back the same amount of money which they lent, they receive less in real terms because the value of money falls. Thus inflation brings about a redistribution of real wealth in favour of debtors at the cost of creditors.(2) Salaried Persons: Salaried workers such as clerks, teachers, and other white collar persons lose when there is inflation. The reason is that their salaries are slow to adjust when prices are rising.(3) Wage Earners: Wage earners may gain or lose depending upon the speed with which their wages adjust to rising prices. If their unions are strong, they may get their wages linked to the cost of living index. In this way, they may be able to protect themselves from the bad effects of inflation.But the problem is that there is often a time lag between the raising of wages by employees and the rise in prices. So workers lose because by the time wages are raised, the cost of living index may have increased further. But where the unions have entered into contractual wages for a fixed period, the workers lose when prices continue to rise during the period of contract. On the whole, the wage earners are in the same position as the white collar persons.(4) Fixed Income Group: The recipients of transfer payments such as pensions, unemployment insurance, social security, etc. and recipients of interest and rent live on fixed incomes. Pensioners get fixed pensions. Similarly the rentier class consisting of interest and rent receivers get fixed payments.The same is the case with the holders of fixed interest bearing securities, debentures and deposits. All such persons lose because they receive fixed payments, while the value of money continues to fall with rising prices.Among these groups, the recipients of transfer payments belong to the lower income group and the rentier class to the upper income group. Inflation redistributes income from these two groups toward the middle income group comprising traders and businessmen.(5) Equity Holders or Investors: Persons who hold shares or stocks of companies gain during inflation. For when prices are rising, business activities expand which increase profits of companies. As profits increase, dividends on equities also increase at a faster rate than prices. But those who invest in debentures, securities, bonds, etc. which carry a fixed interest rate lose during inflation because they receive a fixed sum while the purchasing power is falling.(6) Businessmen: Businessmen of all types, such as producers, traders and real estate holders gain during periods of rising prices. Take producers first. When prices are rising, the value of their inventories (goods in stock) rise in the same proportion. So they profit more when they sell their stored commodities.The same is the case with traders in the short run. But producers profit more in another way. Their costs do not rise to the extent of the rise in the prices of their goods. This is because prices of raw materials and other inputs and wages do not rise immediately to the level of the price rise. The holders of real estate\u2019s also profit during inflation because the prices of landed property increase much faster than the general price level.(7) Agriculturists: Agriculturists are of three types, landlords, peasant proprietors, and landless agricultural workers. Landlords lose during rising prices because they get fixed rents. But peasant proprietors who own and cultivate their farms gain. Prices of farm products increase more than the cost of production.For prices of inputs and land revenue do not rise to the same extent as the rise in the prices of farm products. On the other hand, the landless agricultural workers are hit hard by rising prices. Their wages are not raised by the farm owners, because trade unionism is absent among them. But the prices of consumer goods rise rapidly. So landless agricultural workers are losers.(8) Government: The government as a debtor gains at the expense of households who are its principal creditors. This is because interest rates on government bonds are fixed and are not raised to offset expected rise in prices. The government, in turn, levies less taxes to service and retire its debt.With inflation, even the real value of taxes is reduced. Thus redistribution of wealth in favour of the government accrues as a benefit to the tax-payers. Since the tax-payers of the government are high-income groups, they are also the creditors of the government because it is they who hold government bonds.As creditors, the real value of their assets decline and as tax-payers, the real value of their liabilities also declines during inflation. The extent to which they will be gainers or losers on the whole is a very complicated calculation. ",

            "answer_text": " In 1971, a $1.00 bill had the same purchasing power as $5.95 does in 2016. That is, any fiat currency valued at $1.00 would only buy 16.8\u00a2 worth of goods in 1971. Inflation is in essence the decrease in the purchasing power of fiat currency, and is an economic force that will always be around as long as the global economy is growing, and paper currency is being printed. What causes inflation? Inflation is typically caused when the aggregate demand in an economy exceeds aggregate supply, meaning consumers spend more than an economy can output. This process decreases the purchasing power of the currency being used because producers have to raise prices in order to meet demand. Economists call this \u201cDemand-pull inflation,\u201d which simply put, means that a rising demand for consumption can only push prices up.  A common reason for this type of inflation stems from when a country\u2019s central bank rapidly increases the supply of money within an economy - this is called Quantitative easing. The increase in money within an economy will subsequently increase demand for goods and services. Because firms will not be able to respond to this rise in demand as quickly as need be, they must raise prices in order to counteract the greater need for consumption, thus, decreasing the purchasing power of each unit of currency. This injection of money into the economy by Central banks is referred to as monetary policy. Although, for example, printing money could be one measure to increase the money supply in an economy, this is usually only used in desperate measures. There are three main ways the Fed can influence the money supply: Modifying reserve requirements: the Central bank dictates the amount of funds banks are allowed to hold at any given time. By lowering the reserve requirements, banks are able loan more money, which increases the overall supply of money in the economy.Changing interest rates: The Fed has the power to lower or raise the discount rate that banks pay on short-term loans from the Fed. By doing so, the Fed is able to effectively increase (or decrease) the liquidity of money. It is important to keep interest rates stable however, as prolonged decreases in the discount rate will fuel inflation as banks will borrow much higher amounts.Open market operations: This is where the Fed buys and sells government securities and/or bonds in the open market. If the Fed wants to increase the money supply, it buys government bonds, which supplies the securities dealers who sell the bonds with cash, increasing the overall supply of money in an economy.The second main process that causes inflation is called cost-push inflation. This occurs when prices of production inputs increase. This can result from rapid wage increases or rising raw material prices for example.  Ontario for example is planning on implementing a $15 minimum wage in 2019 (up from $11.25) which will force producers to raise prices and minimize the quantity of labour they seek. A near $4 rise in the minimum wage will leave more workers unemployed and will cause a spike in inflation within Canada once implemented. While the differences in inflation noted above may seem simple, the cause of price level changes observed in the real economy are often much more complex. In a dynamic economy it can be especially difficult to isolate a single cause of a change in the price level. However, knowing what inflation is and what conditions might cause it is a great start! What is a good target for inflation? In an advanced economy, the Fed/central bank will actively increase and decrease the money supply through these actions in order to maintain a stable inflation rate. In most developed economies an inflation rate of 1\u20133% is considered healthy, and anything above 4% is cause for concern.  A great example of this is the average inflation rate of OECD countries which consist of the USA, UK, Germany, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, and several others, all of which have developed economies. By maintaining an inflation rate of 1\u20133%, central banks are maintaining longterm price stability which help prevent economies from collapsing detrimentally as seen in the 2008 financial crisis. If inflation were to spike out of this range as seen on a few occasions, most notably in 2008, then your average goods and services will become much more expensive in order to meet the falling demand for the latter. Inflation and Minimum Wages Inflation is inevitable when the global economy runs on fiat currencies, and large-scale debt-financing from banks and central banks and banks to the population. But a large problem developed economies face is that certain economic variables don\u2019t rise in correspondence with the inflation rate - minimum wages are a prime example of this.  This chart outlines the US economy, but this pattern can be seen in many other developed nations around the world. As it goes, minimum wages as adjusted for inflation began to lose their purchasing power beginning in the 1970\u2019s when it peaked. Basically, minimum wages have not risen as consistently as the inflation rate in the past several decades. Rather, governments wait until a public outcry for a rise in the minimum wage to actually raise it, a pattern that only adds more fuel to the fire.  Taking this same graph, it\u2019s important to realize that the periodic increases in the United States\u2019 minimum wage are not enough to adequately keep up with inflation. As outlined with the green and red arrows, a rise in the minimum wage increases purchasing power, but only for a few years. Each subsequent raise in the minimum wage has been larger than the last, but they always lead to the same outcome: a decrease in purchasing power. There is little evidence to support that raising minimum wages also increases inflation - there are many different variables at work here that don\u2019t have to do with minimum wages - but we can clearly see from this graph that since the 1970\u2019s, the US Federal Reserve has kept the purchasing power of those working at minimum wages at a minimum.  Wealth inequality is a clear result of inflationary pressures on the middle and lower classes of not only America, but many other developed nations. That is, if you fail to raise the minimum wage in relation to the inflation rate, the purchasing power of those working on minimum wages (most notably the middle to lower classes) is ultimately controlled by central bank quantitative easing/open market operation decisions. Like I said, it is difficult to prove that raising minimum wages in itself has the power to increase inflation, but when you think about it logically, it does make sense. Just as increasing the money supply by a Central bank will increase inflation, a rapid spike in the money supply of the middle to lower classes that is caused by a rise in the minimum wage should also, in theory, raise inflation rates. If this portion of the population has more money to spend, they will most likely spend it because their newly increased purchasing power will allow it for now - until of course, it falls again a few years later. To wrap this answer up, inflation fluctuates a great deal and is controlled primarily by central banks around the world. Capitalist economies offer more options for growth to those with the most money to spend, and hurts those with the least amount to spend, meaning that inflation hurts the poor more than it hurts the rich.

            "answer_text": "Inflation is usually a symptom of a phenomenon than a problem by itself. Inflation essentially can happen due to four reasons i) Increase in demand ii) Decrease in Supply iii) Quantitative easing ,iv) Reduced confidence in Fiat. i) Increase in demand: When purchasing power of people increases, suddenly there is a larger pool of people competing for same goods and services and prices will rise to reflect until a balance is reached leading to inflation. ii) Decrease in Supply: Inflation will rise if good supply decreases due to natural causes/ regulations , resulting in people competing over a limited product. iii) Quantitative easing: This is essentially how money flow is increased by central bank. Since the modern currencies are not backed by any asset with fixed value, the currency by itself is a commodity and its purchasing power is in turn determined by its supply. When Central Bank prints more currency to match the growth without corresponding increase in productivity, it will lead to inflation. iv) Reduced confidence in Fiat: Since the currency is essentially backed by people\u2019s confidence , there are conditions such as War and drought, that could make people lose faith in the government and its currency. This could lead to hyperinflation, as less and less people are willing to accept the currency. In an ideal free market , inflation should be zero, as demand will always be matched by a supply. But in reality inflation exists because of growth in population, barriers to entry, scarcity of resources, regulation etc. Usually if inflation is due to reason i) , then economy is in good shape. Inflation due to factors iii) and iv) is almost always very bad for economy and social well being. Factor iii) is complex and is usually for the worse than the better. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s an excerpt of an article I have written on Inflation [Full article here: Inflation. Everything you Need to Know About it.] The first question that pops into our heads when we hear the word inflation is: Is it good or bad? And the answer will always be both yes and no. But before that, we should understand what it is, what causes it, and how is it stimulated or controlled? Inflation in its most basic definition is a sustained rise in prices. We can categorize it in two ways, the first way is the main categorization (i.e. type) and the second way is how fast or which way it goes (i.e. magnitude and direction). We can start with the first categorization that gives us two main types of inflation: Cost-push inflation: it occurs when the economy starts to overheat due to excessive growth activity. It can be explained by a simple imbalance in demand/supply powers where demand increases at a faster rate than supply. This type is usually controlled through a hike in interest rates and a decrease in money supply. Raising interest rates discourages borrowing for businesses and thus slows down the economy. Another effect of this is that it makes the currency more attractive as an investment and thus it appreciates in value. An appreciating currency has a deflationary effect.Demand-pull inflation: it occurs when there is a general hike in global commodity prices or taxes. It is determined by the supply side. Intuitively, when commodity (raw materials) prices rise, the firms\u2019 costs rise as well, and to combat this, they have to raise prices in order to keep their margins. An example of demand-pull inflation can be a gradual significant rise in oil prices. It is worth mentioning that this type of inflation is not desired as it is accompanied by a fall in the standards of living and due to the fact that governments cannot do much about it.Now, we can categorize inflation according to how fast it moves or in which direction: Regular inflation: This is the usual 2\u20133% expected annual rise in prices. It is the desired and targeted inflation level for many developed world countries as it can be controlled and does not hinder business and economic growth by much.Disinflation: This is a fall in the rate at which inflation increases. For example, if inflation rose by 1% last year, a disinflation happens when inflation rises by 0.5% this year. It can be a warning signal that we are approaching a risky deflationary zone.Stagflation: This is a relatively rare type where inflation is high and increasing while the economy is stagnating, and unemployment is high. The term was first used by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Iain Macleod. This type of inflation can be considered the ultimate nightmare to central bankers as they do not really have much to combat it.Deflation: Although it may seem like a good thing given that deflation is the general fall in prices, it has its repercussions over the long-term. When prices fall and consumers are happy in the short-term, businesses may suffer from decreased margins and may resort to lay-offs to survive.More types of inflation: Shrinkflation: This phenomenon occurs when prices stay the same, but firms reduce the size of their goods. Hence, it is another form of a price increase. Imagine 100 grams of a good priced at $1 in the form of a specific size bag. Shrinkflation occurs when the firm keeps the good at $1 with probably the same bag but usually fills it with 70\u201380 grams of the good. Therefore, the consumer sees the same product but in reality, there is less of it, thus, paying the same price for less.Hyperinflation: It is a rapid uncontrollable rise in inflation. Usually happens in times of war and turmoil and not necessarily in developing countries. It has occurred in Germany and Russia before. There is not an exact percentage increase per year to signify inflation, but some people consider a 50% per month can be considered hyperinflation. The most notable of example is Zimbabwe in 2008 when the inflation rate reached 79,600,000,000% per month (That is 79 Billion percent).Inflation has its effect on Asset Prices. For a trader or an investor or even simply an average citizen, knowing the effect of inflation on wealth is important. We can summarize these effects below: Equities: If inflation is around expectations, equities should perform positively. During high inflationary periods, equities do not perform so well and are generally negative. And finally, in a deflationary environment, equities are also negative due to the decline of the economic activity.Fixed-income: A higher inflation is typically negative for fixed-income securities. As inflation can spur a rate hike, bond prices have to fall (Remember the negative relationship between bond prices and their yields). Fixed-income bonds are the most exposed to inflationary risk. If an investor has a bond that promises 3% a year when inflation is at 4%, the net gain is -1%. Return should be on a real basis (With inflation accounted for) rather than on a nominal basis (Without inflation). During normal times, the returns are relatively stable for both short and long-term fixed-income securities. When inflation is higher than expected, bonds perform poorly as prices drop due to rising yields. With deflation, bonds perform positively due to the fact that future fixed cash flows have a bigger purchasing power.Commodities: Although the relationship between inflation and commodities is becoming more and more complicated over time, it is generally thought of as positive and many commodities can be seen as an inflation hedge (e.g. Gold).Currencies: A slowly rising inflation can have a negative effect on currencies up to the point where investors expect a rate hike, then the effect becomes positive because the currency will be more attractive if it pays a higher yield.Real Estate: If inflation is around expectations, real estate doesn\u2019t move much and remains relatively the same. If inflation is above expectations or high, then it has a general positive effect as real estate values go up with inflation. During deflationary periods, it is a negative impact as prices start declining.",

            "answer_text": "Mild inflation is Good for economy. Excessive inflation is bad. But countries like India where the currency is excessively undervalued the intrest rates must be maintained high to contain inflation. The undervalued currency attracts money from outside to take the advantage of low exchange rates. (arbitrarage ) This is one reason for the higher inflation in India. We maintain a low exchange rate for our currency ro promote exports. In such cases mild or little higher inflation helps the economic growth. India saw high inflation rates when the economy grew much faster. This is better understood by economists. But for a layman I will give a sinple example.. A is having fairly good income and his savings are also good. He buys ahousing property. Say for 10 lakhs. 5 years from then he sells it at 20 lakhs. The intrest rates were 9 pc in that period. By investing this in banks FDR etc he would have earned up to 15.5 lakhs at 9 %. But in property he earns much more so he invests in property. So also in many sectors. The same thing applies to other investments. If the bank FDRS start giving you better income no one will invest in business. The low inflation or negative inflation rates cause stagnation in economy. That is what we saw in last 3 to 4 years. Complete stagnation. The WPI ruled negative for quite some time. Chief economic advisor showed concern about this but he was unheard and now gone. The basic economic theory says Inflation is bad but deflation is worst for economy. India had gone through a state of almost deflation for 2 to 3 years. And now because of low investment level and fixed capital formation we have job problems. SRIRAM ",

            "answer_text": "Inflation first of all is of two types: Cost pushDemand pullCost push inflation is due to shortfall in supply, rising costs mean profitability of businesses decreases, this leads to incomes declining. Further cost of living for households to increase, this has a negative effect on their savings rate. Demand pull inflation is due to excessive money chasing few goods. This also leads to rising costs but this times some businesses can transfer the costs to customer as demand is already high. In such cases supply tends to increase which has a cyclical effect and creates further demand. This type of inflation can be addressed by the central Banks more easily. In both cases inflation leads to rising costs which leads to fall in income, what inflation also leads to is erosion of savings. High inflation eats into savings and this is very bad especially for retired people, In such cases of people lose faith in the economy and this leads to long lasting negative prospects. Also in cases of high inflation people fear rising prices and spend the money quickly this makes it a self feeding loop. As inflation= more demand= inflation. Hence, High double digit inflation is destabilising for the financial system of a country. But central banks today use the concept of inflation targeting. They use monetary policy to stimulate the economy while staying within the targeted inflation. ",

            "answer_text": "The costs of inflation cited by economists tend to be different and fall into two categories: the costs of expected inflation and the costs of unexpected inflation. Costs of Expected inflation: Shoe-leather costs. These costs reflect the inconvenience of a reduction in money holding that arises during periods of high inflation when individuals tend to make more frequent but smaller cash withdrawals. The name \u201cshoe-leather\u201d is metaphoric \u2013 walking to the bank wears out one\u2019s shoes, but worn-out shoes is hardly the only inconvenience of going to the bank more often.Menu costs. These costs arise due to firms changing and posting their prices with higher frequency during times of high inflation. The name \u201cmenu\u201d costs refers to restaurants having to change prices of dishes (and, therefore, print new menus) more often during high-inflation periods. Restaurants, of course, are not the only businesses that incur menu costs. While one might think of menu costs as costs that follow the decision about what the new price should be (such as reprinting catalogs, updating computer systems, reprinting price tags, etc.), it is useful to keep in mind the cost of the very decision of what the new price ought to be (such as gathering relevant information and processing it).Increase in relative price volatility. These costs arise because firms facing menu costs are not likely to change prices frequently. As a result, relative price volatility increases. This, in turn, leads to inefficiencies in resource allocation.Tax distortions. These costs arise because many tax laws do not take inflation into account. That is, they focus on one\u2019s nominal rather than real income. Inflation can result in an arbitrary change in a person\u2019s tax liability. Costs of Unexpected Inflation Arbitrary redistribution of wealth from lenders to borrowers. When inflation turns out to be different from expectations, some groups can be made better off, while others can be made worse off. For instance, when inflation turns out to be higher than expected, lenders can realize losses, while borrowers can gain.Costs to individuals on fixed nominal contracts. Many long-term contracts build in an adjustment for inflation. People whose contract payments are fixed will suffer a loss in real terms (that is, in terms of purchasing power) if inflation turns out higher than they expected. For example, if pension payments are fixed for many periods and inflation ends up being higher than expected, then real pension payments end up being lower than expected.How Large Are These Costs?It is natural to wonder which of the cited costs of inflation is the largest or most important. The answer to this question truly depends on the time period considered, the country under consideration, and the severity of inflation or deflation (for instance, it matters whether it is moderate, high, or hyperinflation).Though it is hard to quantify the costs of price volatility, it is a critical issue, especially for a central bank. What may surprise some people is that, although inflation is costly, policymakers generally do not wish for zero inflation. This is because reducing inflation from some low positive rate to zero might come at the expense of higher unemployment (and lower output). Thus, the costs of going from low to zero inflation are thought to exceed the benefits. This is further complicated by the difficulty of measuring inflation precisely enough to be certain exactly how close you are to zero inflation. Of course, that is why economists keep a close eye on several measures of inflation! ",

            "answer_text": "Inflation is usually a symptom of a phenomenon than a problem by itself. Inflation essentially can happen due to four reasons i) Increase in demand ii) Decrease in Supply iii) Quantitative easing ,iv) Reduced confidence in Fiat.i) Increase in demand: When purchasing power of people increases, suddenly there is a larger pool of people competing for same goods and services and prices will rise to reflect until a balance is reached leading to inflation.ii) Decrease in Supply: Inflation will rise if good supply decreases due to natural causes/ regulations , resulting in people competing over a limited product.iii) Quantitative easing: This is essentially how money flow is increased by central bank. Since the modern currencies are not backed by any asset with fixed value, the currency by itself is a commodity and its purchasing power is in turn determined by its supply. When Central Bank prints more currency to match the growth without corresponding increase in productivity, it will lead to inflation.iv) Reduced confidence in Fiat: Since the currency is essentially backed by people\u2019s confidence , there are conditions such as War and drought, that could make people lose faith in the government and its currency. This could lead to hyperinflation, as less and less people are willing to accept the Currency Converter - Currency.IN an ideal free market , inflation should be zero, as demand will always be matched by a supply. But in reality inflation exists because of growth in population, barriers to entry, scarcity of resources, regulation etc.Usually if inflation is due to reason i) , then economy is in good shape. Inflation due to factors iii) and iv) is almost always very bad for economy and social well being. Factor iii) is complex and is usually for the worse than the better. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the level of inflation you are talking about: 1 - Negative inflation, aka deflation. This is a disaster. It undermines confidence, it creates a self-reinforced deflation spiral, and it gives rise to major economic depression. 2 - Low inflation (0\u20131.5%) is mostly a symptom of some kind of problem in the economy that is keeping it from achieving its full potential. Usually, it is a crisis in demand or a problem of oversupply. It can come associated with high unemployment and low wages. 3 - Desirable inflation (around 2%). This is the sweet spot, where you want your economy to go. It means that the economy is close to its full potential, but it is not overheating. GDP is probably growing, and people are having a normal time finding jobs. 3 - Moderate inflation (from 3\u20135%). This is probably a symptom of an economic adjustment. It can mean that the economy is overheating and unemployment may be getting too low, it can mean that wages are catching up with previous increases in productivity, it can mean that, in a common currency, such as the Euro, the more productive countries are reaping the benefits of their higher productivity, while allowing for other countries to catch-up. 4 - Double digit inflation. This is a common symptom of a problem with the economy. It can be caused by a number of factors, but mostly it can mean that the economy is growing too fast too quickly. It can mean that the country is undergoing a competitive devaluation of its currency, it can mean that there is some political turmoil, it can mean that the economy needs some structural reforms. Each individual case would have to be studied, as it is very different to have 20% inflation with low unemployment (overheated economy) or to have 20% inflation with high unemployment (stagflation). 5 - Hyperinflation. This is a really nasty one, on par with number 1. This is a symptom of a serious supply-side problem. Basically, the economy is not producing enough wealth for the expenditures, and the government is making up for the deficit by printing more money, as if there was no tomorrow. As it does that, the currency loses most of its value, confidence is eroded, and companies start raising prices for the goods that are in short supply. After a while, it also feeds on itself, as the expectation of inflation leads to even more inflation, and it is also very hard to come out of without severe austerity. ",

Opposite effect takes place when it falls.ON AGGREGATE DEMAND - Rising inflation indicates comparatively lower supply and higher purchasing capacity among the consumers. which is an indication of higher demand in the economy.ON INVESTMENT - Investment in the economy is boosted by inflation because higher inflation indicates higher demand and suggests entrepreneur to expand their production level.ON INCOME - It affects the income of individuals and firms alike. In a given period of time, income may go up due to two reasons,viz. inflationary situation and increased earning. Concept \u2018GDP DEFLACTOR\u2019 gives the idea of \u2018inflation effect\u2019 on income for a given period.ON SAVING AND EXPENDITURE - Inflation affects both the forms of expenditures - consumption as well as investment. In the long run, Higher inflation depletes the saving rate in an economy while in short term effect of inflation saving rate increases. Opposite situation arises when inflation falls.ON TAX - I) Due to inflation, direct tax, burden of tax-prayers also increases as tax-payer's gross income moves to the upward slabs of official tax brackets. 2.) Inflation increases the nominal value of gross tax revenue, while real value of tax collection doesn't compare with the current pace of inflation as there is a lag in the tax collection in all economies. But the Govt. gets an advantage on their interest burden, on their borrowings as inflation benifits borrowers. This benifit however depends upon the contemporary levels of fiscal deficit and the total national debt.ON EXCHANGE RATE - With every inflation, the currency of economy depreciates provided it follows the flexible currency regime. There might be inflationary pressure on foreign currency against which the exchange rate is compared.ON EXPORT AND IMPORT - With inflation, exportable items of an economy gain competitive prices in world market. Due to this, volume of export increases. Inflation gives an economy the advantage of lower imports and import substitution as foreign goods become costlier.ON TRADE BALANCE - In the case of a developed economy, inflation makes trade balance favourable, while for the developing economies inflation is unfavourable for their balance of trade.ON EMPLOYMENT & WAGES - Inflation increases employment in short run but becomes natural or even negative in long run. It increases the nominal value of wages, while their real value falls. That is why there is a negative impact of inflation on the purchasing power and living standard of wage employees. To neutralise this -ve impact, Indian Govt. provides dearness allowance to its employees twice a year.A particular level of inflation is healthy for an economy. This specific level of inflation is called as \u2018range of inflation\u2019 and every economy needs to calculate its own range. Inflation beyond both the limits of the range is never healthy for an economy. For India, it is considered 2% to 6% at CPI(C), also known as \u2018Comfort zone\u2019 of inflation. That's why every economy today utilizes inflation targeting as part of its monetary policy. Inflation beyond the the limits of decided or prescribed range brings in recessions to depressions. Hope it helps ",

            "answer_text": "To understand the Inflation phenomena first everyone needs to understand what the money really is. I will create the money through a highly enlightening story. Imagine that everyone has to pay for everything he buys, giving in return what he produces. How would people pay for groceries, at the gas station, at the movies, at all the shops they go to, doctors, hospitals, insurance, buying a car, property, or paying rent? That would be very difficult. So let's look at an example of how to improve this situation. Suppose you work in a bakery and on the day of receiving your salary the owner wants to pay you in products from your establishment, but since you are not in need of bakery products, you ask him to write down on paper your credit in bakery products as your salary. He agrees to do so, and to attest to the authenticity of this credit, he signs it. Since you need fuel for your car, you go to a gas station and ask if the station owner is in need of bakery products. Then, you negotiate, and by mutual agreement, you buy a quantity of fuel, giving in exchange your credits from the bakery. Imagine that the bakery owner also pays other employees and their suppliers with product credit. If all the people who receive the credits go to the bakery to exchange them for the products they want, there will be no shortage of products, because the employees and the suppliers collaborated in the production of the bakery, and that is why they received the credits; that is, they have the right to buy a quantity of bakery products, because they have cooperated in producing them. Inflation Now, look at inflation and see what it truly is. Imagine that some people will be able to falsify the credits of that bakery and exchange them for its products every day. As the owner of the bakery cannot differentiate between false and true credits, he finds himself obliged to honor the exchange commitments. But as people who buy with false credits did not cooperate in the production of the bakery, at some time, the bakery will begin to lack products, and day by day, more people will be without their preferred products, causing the owner of the bakery no longer to honor the commitments assumed in the true credits. He will try to put more products on the shelves, increasing his production. However, it is not possible to escape mathematics, because the amount of credits will always be greater than the quantity of products available, due to false credits. The bakery owner does not want to close his company and to avoid total default to creditors, he decides to reduce the credits\u2019 value. For example, if a credit was entitled to 10 loaves, the owner stipulates that the holder of the paper will be entitled to 8, in the attempt that all creditors will be able to exchange their credits for products, so that none of them leaves with empty hands. However, the news that the credits now worth less than before is spreading, and then the employees are asking for a salary increase, and their suppliers are asking for more credits, because when they go shopping with these credits, the shop owners ask them for more credit for what they were previously less charged for; that is, all people seek to protect themselves from the devaluation of credits, including counterfeiters, who increase the counterfeit amount to keep up the level of their purchases. Therefore, if new fake credits do not stop coming into circulation, new rounds of devaluation will need to be made by the bakery owner, so no one is left empty-handed. In real life, the bakery credits issues in this metaphor is our money notes. Therefore, this metaphor shows what inflation really is: a theft of the right to buy rarities that only those who produce rarities can have; and inflation is a swipe achieved through counterfeiting of money! Notice that the value of the credits, that is, the value of the notes of money, is born of the production made in exchange for them. To resume the knowledge about the relationship between the circulation of money and the production of goods and services in our economy look what I called \u201cThe Capitalism in Three Steps\u201d: I produce what someone wants and sell it to him.You produce what I desire, and I buy it from you with the money from my sale.Someone else produces what you want, and you buy it from him with the money from your sale.Do you realize that capitalism is not about money? That no one wants the money itself? Notice that in these three steps, three people produced three goods or services and sold them to whoever desired them, and each of the three people bought the product or service he desired for his satisfaction. Therefore, money only circulated between them. So you may ask, how can there be fake money in the market? Since the notes we have are true, who are the counterfeiters? Loans I will use the preceding metaphor to show that lendings are the first cause of inflation, although they do not necessarily cause inflation. If the bakery owner gives the credits to the employee before he produces, but in the following days, the employee actually works, there will be no inflation because, with the work, the employee will collaborate to keep the bakery with products on the shelves. The same occurs in the case of suppliers who receive the credits in advance but who deliver the inputs on the following days. So realize that credit loans do not cause inflation, as long as they are honored. But if the loans are not honored, those who have received them will have consumed products and services without entitlement, since they have produced nothing to give in exchange, and it generates inflation in the same way as using counterfeit credits. Basically, that story shows us what the money really is and what causes inflation! How does Inflation affect the economy? Look how the falsification of credits corrodes capitalism because the forgery of credits leads to unfair competition for products and services. By the natural action of the Laws of Economics, society tries to solve this situation, causing that the money loses value in front of all the products and services so that nobody is left empty-handed. Inflation is a theft of whoever produced the wealth of truth. This metaphor also shows that it is not possible for anyone to resist inflation by ceasing to raise their prices, because whoever does this will simply be impoverished since it is impossible to fight against the Laws of Economics. I need to fixate two things for you. The first is that inflation appears as price increases of all things, but in fact, it is the loss of value of money in relation to all products and services because of the circulation of counterfeit money. It does not mean that the products and services are becoming more valuable; rather, it is the money that is losing value in relation to all things. The second important point to note is that entrepreneurs are not to blame for inflation. They are actually producing products and services, not faking money! To follow on in knowledge about economics, I invite you to look inside the book \u201cNo One Can Escape the 4 Laws\u201d. That book is about the main four economics law that everyone should know.

            "answer_text": "As noted in my answer & James Thompson\u2019s answer to How costly is inflation, and how costly is reducing inflation? and Eugene Winter\u2019s & Marcus Troyka\u2019s answers to How does inflation affect the economic growth of a country?, inflation is almost always harmful. It may be beneficial when the Wicksellian interest rate is negative, but I am not sure that this has ever happened. Jose Luis Malaquias\u2019s answer deals mostly with correlations, but I wrote a detailed comment. Other answers are older, so I\u2019ll just make notes here. David McDonald\u2019s answer makes some interesting points but goes astray. Certainly the high pre-crisis inflation did not prevent the crash in 2008. If anything, it aggravated the imbalances that had to be corrected. Instead of being stable, inflation fell slightly just when it might have been beneficial, and now central bankers want to increase it even though they know that the economy may be overheated. Nitin S. Joglekar (\u0928\u093f\u0924\u0940\u0928 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940. \u091c\u094b\u0917\u0933\u0947\u0915\u0930)\u2019s assertion that inflation is necessary for growth is simply wrong: Adam Smith documented an association between economic growth and deflation. The propensity to spend & invest depends primarily on the real interest rate, and under normal conditions a positive rate is needed to keep supply & demand in balance. Mitesh Tilokani suggests that inflation is a sign of a healthy economy, which might be true if the central bank does not respond correctly to the inflationary pressure. As far as I can tell, there is no assertion that inflation causes economic improvement, so this doesn\u2019t really answer the question. Mathew Cherian\u2019s answer is similar, but he tries to slip in a reversal of the causality. User-13779152110188462111 is correct that many economists assert that \u2018controlled\u2019 inflation is good for the economy (although 6% per annum is well beyond what most of them recommend). As far as I can tell, they are influenced by, and in turn advance, central-bank propaganda. It\u2019s hard to advocate price stability when central banks are under pressure to finance the government & bail out government cronies and macro-economists are funded by central banks or hope for positions at central banks. Libero may be correct that a growing economy needs a growing monetary base, but the monetary growth should be matched to the real growth (to produce price stability or mild deflation) rather than racing ahead of it. Vipin mentions a \u2018comfort zone\u2019 of inflation, but I don\u2019t see that any argument is given. It may be buried in one of the bullet points. Prakash Bapat (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936 \u092c\u093e\u092a\u091f)\u2019s answer is muddled. He asserts that \u2018mild\u2019 inflation is good for the economy and argues later that \u2018near deflation\u2019 caused a problem in India, but in the middle he admits that inflation is very high. Perhaps it would make sense with a timeline. TL;DR This page has lots of suggestions that frequent doubling of prices (once in just over a generation, or even twice a generation) is somehow advantageous, but little evidence. As noted in my first paragraph, inflation is harmful. ",

            "answer_text": "Inflation is the rise of prices over time. Prices rise over time because of increases in population and resultant demands for products. Inflation directly affects interest rates. Consider this: If lending money is healthy for the economy because it promotes growth, interest rates must be higher than inflation. (If I lent out money at a 5 percent annual interest rate, but inflation was at 10 percent, I would never lend money). Thus, the Central Bank watches inflation closely as part of its role of setting interest rates. At the same time, some amount of inflation (usually around 1 to 2 percent) is a sign of a healthy economy. If the economy is healthy and the stock market is growing, consumer spending increases. This means that people are buying more goods, and by consequence, more goods are in demand. No inflation means that you do not have a robust economy \u2013 that there is no competitive demand for goods. Either way, inflation must be watched closely. From basic microeconomics we know that if the demand rises because of higher personal income, the new equilibrium price is higher. Once prices rise, supply rises more (sellers of goods enter the market to take advantage of the opportunity). Hence, prices reach a new equilibrium above the previous equilibrium. Trends can theoretically spiral upward, as increased supply indicating a healthy economy further boosts the demand and supply. ",

Rising prices, known as inflation, impact the cost of living, the cost of doing business, borrowing money, mortgages, corporate and government bond yields, and every other facet of the economy. Inflation can be both beneficial to economic recovery and, in some cases, negative. If inflation becomes too high the economy can suffer; conversely, if inflation is controlled and at reasonable levels, the economy may prosper. With controlled, lower inflation, employment increases, consumers have more money to buy goods and services, and the economy benefits and grows. However, the impact of inflation on economic recovery cannot be assessed with complete accuracy. Some background details will explain why the economic results of inflation will differ as the inflation rate varies. ",

In socialist closed economy times of early days of our country, inflation had no effect because the economy was not strung for consumption based expansion since the wages were low. Now that we are an open economy, with higher wages and living standards rising due to consumption choices and wealth based cultural directions, small changes in prices affect the buying power of citizen. So new fundamentals like propensity and tradeoffs in individual consumption decisions come to play, which was not there in early days. So as inflation rise, this two unknowns in the decision making change and the consuming citizen has to string himself always to meet the demands on his wealth for consumption and keep the contingent events in mind when planning his endowments or simply cash flow for every period. If inflation pick up, then his propensity to consume will be lowered which is painful for individual consumer and some time has to forfeit or delay consumption which are also painful. This can also reduce the value of his savings, which effects his wealth. ",

Have housing prices gone up much since the crash? In some places yes, but in others, not so much. Why? Because the inflation rate is virtually zero, and absent any changes in the demand-to-supply dynamics in some areas, prices haven\u2019t increased. In other areas, that dynamic is much more fluid, and so prices have gone up. Many live for the day when a house was considered \u201can investment,\u201d but looking back on it, was it, or did houses simple appreciate because of inflation? Everyone will have a different opinion, and not everyone will be correct. The point I\u2019m trying to make is that some will look back on an era and assume that it consisted of real economic growth where in fact, the only growth they personally experienced, either in pay raises of the increased value of their homes, was caused by inflation. And they\u2019ll look back with nostalgia, and not only that, demand that the government \u201cdo something\u201d to give them the feeling of economic growth that they don\u2019t know they never experienced, but presume they had. It\u2019s a slippery slope. If we lived in a perpetual state of zero inflation, then we\u2019d see that economic growth occurs in some parts of the country, but not others, and the dissatisfaction of those in the no-growth areas would be tumult, vocal, and vociferous. It would, and has bred discontent; isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re experiencing now, and isn\u2019t that the reason for the ascendency of Trump? I\u2019m not sure that inflation and economic growth are either complementary, coincidental, or can even be considered in the same breath. They\u2019re distinct, though often confused, and therein lies the problem. Does one affect the other? No, but again, it\u2019s the inability of those affected to differentiate them that\u2019s the problem ",

            "answer_text": "Inflation is simply the decrease in the purchasing power of money. As an example The basket of goods that 100 \u20b9 can buy. If that amount of goods in the basket keeps decreasing then we have inflation. When the reserve bank creates money out of thin air then we have more rupees in the system. Then the banks get this money from RBI and lend out easy loans to people. The this money comes out in the market to buy goods construction or sometimes consumer goods. This intervention causes the value of the currency to go down as we have more of it in the system. So inflation happens and the prices of consumer and other goods goes up. You basically have to pay more money to buy apples since the value of your 100 \u20b9 is not what it was when your dad was young. ",

            "answer_text": "Inflation means prices going up and buying capacity of the people comes down. The interest rates move up and new capacities become difficult to add. So the production goes down and as a whole the GDP comes down.  People become investment averse and start looking at risk free investments which thrives and banks would have no opportunity to lend.  So the deposit rates start falling down.  The whole thing starts spiraling and then interest rates start falling and the revival is triggered. ",

But imagine if the price of the car itself were to start falling. Instead of buying yourself a new car this year, why not buy it next year, when it might be hundreds of pounds cheaper? A little inflation encourages you to buy sooner - and that boosts economic growth. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it should be zero, but\u2026 money illusion In a normal market people shouldn\u2019t care about the relative prices of currency, but they do. People expect their currency to resemble gold. Gold, except for being a great currency is also a great store of wealth. To mimic this feature fiat currency has to be made nominally stable, i.e. it\u2019s supply needs to be artificially pegged to it\u2019s historic value. And yes, pegging means fixing markets like a true anti-capitalist. After this fixing, and absent a flexible credit market that also needs to be fixed to keep the system from leaking, people tend to keep their money in their current account expecting it to retain purchasing power; which it won\u2019t; because of politicians. When inflation kicks in people (and foreigners) notice later than sooner that they need to get out of their artificial assets. The reason for this late notice is, that everything is denoted and measured in the currency to begin with. Real shocks from nominal changes can be many things, dependent on the level of market fixing. ",

Inflation accompanies money insertion into the economy to increase money, the Vertical one, created by the govt at zero cost, called fiscal deficit, to mislead us. GDP growth overrides inflation almost always. China has used 25% GDP fiscal deficits with 5% inflation. India has not. Chidambaram bragged that he would hold fiscal deficit to 2.5%GDP under the mistaken notion to minimize ( fiscal deficit + trade deficit) as in the gold standard. India is way behind times. The gold standard died in 1971. In fiat money we have to maximize(fiscal deficit - trade deficit). ",
