            "answer_text": "The American colonies were colonies and treated as such. In particular, there restrictions on economic activity and trade that were imposed to benefit England and, of course, there was no direct representation in Parliament. There was something like a civil war within the colonies since not all the colonists wanted to break with England. Loyalist regiments were raised to support the British Army, and there was often violent repression of loyalist sentiment where the rebels had control. The difference between the Revolution and the Civil War is that the southern states were not colonies but full members of the United States. The southern states had direct representation in the government and the existence of slavery was woven into the constitution. In political terms, the issue was not over the existence of slavery in states where it already existed, but whether additional slave states would be created out of the western territories. The question had been a source of political conflict and compromise at the federal level for years, but by 1860 the weight of opinion in the north was pretty decisively against expansion. Rather than accept this, the south chose to abandon politics and took up arms. ",

            "answer_text": "I think how any conflict is described depends on the perspective of the observer. from the British perspective the 1775-1783 colonial uprising was exactly that, a civil rebellion by traitors challenging the lawful government; at least until they decided to sign the Treaty of Paris and recognize the United States as an independent nation. likewise the 1860-1865 conflict was, from the perspective of those calling themselves the CSA, viewed as a war between two independent nations rather than a 'civil war' or internal state conflict -- in their view they became independent at the moment of secession and US military actions after that were state aggression. under modern international law, both would probably be viewed initially as internal 'civil' conflicts. then, as various conditions began to be met by those in rebellion, each could have gradually assumed the character of an international conflict until at some point most or all outside observers and the UN might officially have viewed them that way. the requirements are a bit technical and arbitrary but involve, in part, the area in rebellion having functioning civil government, control of defined territory, international recognition of statehood, and various other things consistent with being an independent state. see https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/opinion-paper-armed-conflict.pdf (Red Cross analysis of Internal vs. International Armed Conflict). under this analysis, there were key differences between the two conflicts that led to different historical characterizations -- the 1775-1783 conflict kept moving further along the conflict arc, meeting more and more conditions until ultimately everyone recognized the conflict as international, and even Britain ultimately agreed by treaty. in contrast the 1860-1865 conflict didn't ultimately move far enough and didn't successfully meet enough conditions, so it was never fully viewed this way; the states in rebellion ultimately quit the fight and agreed to remain part of the US, validating the view that the conflict was 'civil' or internal. historical hindsight allows events to appear clearer then they were to observers at the time. participants in each conflict were desperately fighting to validate their views as 'true,' and in both cases the outcome was at least somewhat in doubt and the 'true' character of each conflict was uncertain -- until it wasn't. in the end how a particular observer chooses to describe a conflict seems to be about the observer's politics -- does the observer 'want' it to be an international conflict, or just an internal civil one?
