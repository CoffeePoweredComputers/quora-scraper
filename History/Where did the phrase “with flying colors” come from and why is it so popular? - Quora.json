            "answer_text": "\u201cColors\u201d are the flag of any military unit - land or sea. \u201cFlying colors\u201d implies a victory has been won by that unit, as defeat could mean the \u201ccolors\u201d fell into the hands of the enemy. Capturing the flag of an enemy was a \u201cbig deal\u201d. Displaying the victor\u2019s flag was similarly a \u201cbig deal\u201d as at Iwo Jima. Why Civil War Flags Were So Important Being a color bearer was considered a mark of great distinction and it required a soldier of extraordinary bravery. The job was to carry the flag where the regimental officers directed, while unarmed and under fire. Most importantly, color bearers had to face the enemy and never break and run in retreat, or the entire regiment might follow. Conversely, to capture the battle flag of an opponent was considered a great triumph, and captured flags were cherished as trophies. Accounts of Civil War battles in newspapers at the time would generally mention if any enemy flags had been captured. \u201cFlying Colors\u201d were extremely important then and still today we placed an American Flag on the Moon.

            "answer_text": "With due respect to the online etymological resources, the earliest uses of the expression with flying colors are not in fact nautical, and they go back much further than 1706. The best way to determine the origin of a phrase is to examine its earliest appearances in the record. Our phrase appears at least as early as 1612: \u201cphilips army with flying colours sent lately into ireland vpon gift made vnto him by the pope, etc.\u201d And from 1625: \u201cthey levied and brought into the field many men, vnder flying colours, their colours.\u201d Thus the expression with flying colors comes from a military usage, referring to an army marching with its standards and banners waving. As to when the phrase adopted its current sense, I cannot say. ",
