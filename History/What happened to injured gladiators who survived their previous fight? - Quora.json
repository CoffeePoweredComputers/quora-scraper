            "answer_text": "Contrary to Hollywood portrayals of gladiatorial combat always being a fight to the death (see Spartacus, 1960), these ancient Roman athletes were highly trained professionals who made their living fighting, not dying. And since gladiators were expensive to prepare and maintain, killing off mass numbers of them would have been a bad business decision for the lanistae who owned and trained them. Roman Gladiators who survived fights in the arena - and there were many - were given the best medical care that Rome had to offer. They were considered valuable property and not thrown away lightly. Forensic examinations of Gladiator bones show grievous wounds but also a great deal of premortum healing, indicating sophisticated medical treatment. Using Roman surgical techniques and Greek medicine was extremely effective in helping to get these men back on their feet. In one instance, a gladiator shared a doctor with the Emperor himself, and in another instance a gladiator's doctor provided such great physiotherapy that a fracture on a gladiator\u2019s forearm was near invisible to the naked eye, found during a present day autopsy. Analysis of skulls found in Gladiator graves likewise show bone growth that is thought to be a result of this care. Most injured Gladiators were patched up and sent back into the arena again when they were deemed ready by the medicus (doctor). ",

            "answer_text": "The were given the best medicine and doctors Rome had to offer. The most advanced in the world at the time. Youd be shocked to see how much Romans knew. Everything from traction for broken bones to cataract surgery. And fyu, most gladiators did survive their battles as they didnt fight to the death. They were simply too expensive to sponsor. Hope this helped. SPQR Forever !!! ",
