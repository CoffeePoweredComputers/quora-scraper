            "answer_text": "It is a funny question and worth thinking about. Personally I could only list some main reasons : Powerful enough, far enough and have an enormous population. Powerful enoughIn the thousands of years history of Europe, countless empires destroyed by another or collapsed itself. Because they have many enemies around them. The most important reason is, the surrounding enemies always have the similar power of economy and culture. As a result, the wars on Europe has never ended in a true level. Compare with the European empires, China seems to has a more favorable circumstance to develop. Most of the country near China are weak and not aggressive relatively. China is powerful enough to make these countries submission. Since China got its unification in Qin dynasty, it has become a great empire. China consistently radiate its culture, economy, religion and science technology to the countries around. There's rarely have a total war with other countries except the Huns (Xiongnu)in the north.  The territory of China in Qing dynasty Far enoughIt make sense to said China is in a \"Far East\". China is far away the Europe, so it never had a chance to fight with another civilization which has an equal or similar power (Before the First Opium war). The geographic environment provide a great condition for the development of China. It is pity that we can never know which empire is stronger, China or Ancient Rome. As a Chinese, I stand for the China hahaha. Enormous populationIt is very important because have a huge population is never a bad thing, no matter in the ancient or modern-day. More people means more labours, Strong productive forces. An emperor can do whatever he wants, such as the building of the Great Wall which defense the empire from Huns, or The Grand Canal from Beijing to Hangzhou which support the agriculture, transportation and business. Another great advantage of huge population is, the invaders will never totally rule the Chinese successfully. There are two times that China is conquered by invaders, we called it Yuan dynasty and Qing dynasty. The ruler on the throne is no Han people, they would never control such a huge population and the Han never submit to the ruler. As a result, the rulers will be cultural assimilation on the contrary. There are only a small part of the reason for this question. And I believe if you want more comprehensive answers, you need do more research. There is no one, even a Chinese, can explain all the reasons. Because of the long and grand history of China. Thank you for your reading! ",

            "answer_text": "Chinas history doesn\u2019t go as far back as Ethiopias. But in most cases, to analyze any history, you look at artifacts. For example, skeletons. In Egypt, you may find mummies and pyramids.  In Ethiopia, the rock cut churches.  And, In china, their drawings.  No matter how hard it is, our technology is so advanced, we can probably crack the code and analyze it. ",
