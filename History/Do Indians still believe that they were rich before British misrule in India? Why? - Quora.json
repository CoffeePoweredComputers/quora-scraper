            "answer_text": "it is a pure myth Angus Maddison, a British economic historian,, is best known for his estimates of world gross domestic product (GDP) that go back all the way to the year 1 AD. In recent times, his charts have been used to tell the fascinating story of how the share of India and China in world GDP used to be very high till about 1600 AD, but started declining thereafter as they missed the industrial revolution. With their current rapid growth, their share in the world economy is now rising once again.In 1000 AD, according to Maddison\u2019s calculations, China and India together contributed 50.5% of world GDP (GDP being computed in 1990 dollars and in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms). By 1600, that share had gone up to 51.4%, with China accounting for 29% and India 22.4% of world GDP. A hundred years later, China\u2019s GDP had fallen but India\u2019s went up to 24.4% of world output. By 1820, however, India\u2019s share had fallen to 16.1%. By 1870, it went down to 12.2%. International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections indicate that India\u2019s share of world GDP would be 6.1% in 2015.Was colonialism to blame? Did the drain of wealth to Britain impoverish a once wealthy country? Or was the decline in importance merely the result of the rise in productivity in Europe?Well, the growth of India\u2019s GDP between 1500 and 1600 was 22.7%, between 1600 and 1700 it was 22.2% and between 1700 and 1820 it logged 21%. So it\u2019s not as if there was any huge decline in the rate of growth. Of course, that doesn\u2019t preclude the possibility that Indian growth, too, may have taken off if the country was not under the thumb of the British. But China continued to be an independent country, albeit one much plagued by the Western powers, and its rate of growth too during the period was nothing to be proud of. What the data seem to be saying is that the coming of the British did not, at least in the first 100 years of colonial rule, make much of a difference to the growth rate of the Indian economy.Was India a wealthy country before the British came? The numbers that have garnered the most attention have been his GDP estimates, because they fit in with the narrative of a strong India and China getting back their clout in the world economy. But what is that to the average Indian or Chinese citizen? What if the only reason these countries had such a high GDP in earlier times was because they had a larger population?That is what is brought out by Maddison\u2019s estimates of GDP per capita, again in PPP terms in 1990 dollars. In 1 AD, India\u2019s GDP per capita was $450, as was China\u2019s. But Italy under the Roman Empire had a per capita income of $809. In 1000 AD, India\u2019s per capita income was $450 and China\u2019s $466. But the average of the West Asian countries, such as Turkey and Iraq, was much higher at $621. In terms of general prosperity, therefore, it was the Arab world that was doing well a millennium ago. The Caliphate in Baghdad was a centre of power at the time and both science and culture flourished.By 1500, though, new centres of prosperity had emerged. India\u2019s per capita income was $550 and China\u2019s $600 in 1500. The Arab world had declined. But standards of living in Western Europe at that time had already gone far ahead. Italy topped the table, with a per capita income of $1,100, the Netherlands following with a per capita income of $761. This was the Italy of the Renaissance, the Italy of Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, of Raphael and Titian. The UK was not far behind, with a per capita income of $714.By 1600, the centre of Europe had shifted northwards and the golden age of Holland had begun. Dutch per capita income was $1,381 in 1600, while Britain in Shakespeare\u2019s time had a per capita income of $974.Recall that 1600 was the year the East India Company was founded. In contrast, India\u2019s per capita income continued to be $550, while China\u2019s was $600. Note that even Ireland, one of the poorest of Western Europe\u2019s countries, had a per capita income of $615, higher than India\u2019s and China\u2019s. In short, the per capita GDP numbers mirror the changes in power, prosperity and cultural and scientific achievement.It wasn\u2019t till 1981 that India had a per capita income of $977, beating that of Britain in 1600. And it wasn\u2019t until 1993 that India\u2019s per capita income of $1,399 surpassed what the Dutch had achieved in 1600. Maddison\u2019s calculations show that in 2008, India\u2019s per capita GDP ( in 1990 dollars, PPP terms) was $2,975, slightly more than one-third of the world average of $7,614. We have a long way to go. Extracted from an article by Manas Chakravarty Aug 25 2010Published in the on-line magazine of the Hindustan Times-LiveMint. ",

            "answer_text": "The question, as it is stated now [1],  is leading to the extreme and OP apparently does not seem to desire any discussion, just reconfirmation of their idea.  Nevertheless, I will try and answer.  I do not believe that I (ie my ancestors) were rich before the British came to India. I know that they were dirt poor.  I do believe that INDIA on the whole was extremely rich. Think about it - why would anyone come to India and face the hazards here if they were not going to profit from it? I do not believe that the British came here to proselytize  as I argue here Makarand Sahasrabuddhe's answer to Is the British Raj a primary reason or the primary reason that Christianity never flourished on the Indian subcontinent? Which meant that they came for commerce or in other words profits.   There is no dichotomy in India being rich but Indians being poor.  India was ruled by a plethora of kings and landlords with the occasional Emperor to rule them all. The societal and political structure was Feudal and in fact it continues to be so even now - just look at the way families rule even in the democratic  system.  This meant that the wealth was held by very few leaving the rest of the people extremely poor.  Not very different from the situation now.   So India as a land of milk, honey and golden birds - only for the feudal lords. For the rest, it was all about hunger, misery, hard labour and early death.   When the British came to India, they played a Game of Thrones here. Think of them as the Targaryens who conquered and united the 7 (actually probably 7,000 in India) kingdoms.  Only difference is that the British were not driven out by the doom of Valaria but came to India after having heard about the riches of the kings. Even as this game was played, the poor only suffered. To them it mattered not who was the king. Reminds me of what Jorah Mormont told Daenerys Targaryen \"The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends. It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as they are left in peace. They never are. \u201d  Last word:  There is no point in getting carried away by the fact that India (few Indians) were fabulously rich at one point in time. The reality is about today. We as a country have a long way to go before we can even be called developed let alone rich. Focussing on that may be better than being mired in the past.    [1] Do Indians still believe that they were rich before British misrule in India? Why? ",

            "answer_text": "There seem to be many conflicting opinions about this, when the answer is pretty straight forward.  NO. And no brownie points to the one who wrote this question for making it such a blatantly leading one. Indians do not believe that India was rich before the British misrule. We do not believe that the British misruled India. We do not believe that they are the cause of much loss of wealth in India. We do not believe that had the British never turned their attention on India, the average person in modern India would still be living in pretty much the same conditions, except he would probably be better off, marginally, in the economic sense. We know these things, as facts. I am not going to quote some British wise-guy. Lets give them due credit, they were masters at two things, at least :- propaganda, and administration. If I had to name a third, I would say sarcasm (British humor is great), though that is beside the point here. I don't think anyone is going to question the fact that India, prior to British rule, was fabulously wealthy considering the GDP attributed to the region. European travelers' have written extensively about the fabulous wealth of India and China (kindly do refer, to Google, or Quora itself). Lets not go back too far in history; I am talking about the Mughal rule, particularly, Aurangazeb's reign. There are also numerous answers of spectacular detail on Quora about the share of GDP accounted for by India prior to colonial rule. India was invaded, by Europeans and anyone else who ever came here, for this same wealth. Evidence rests everywhere regarding what they took from us. No complaints, to victors go the spoils, blah blah blah... Others here have suggested that India's wealth was accumulated by the rich segments alone. Lets us consider this. Prima facie, this argument is true. As long as there is wealth, there will be the 1% and the 99%. In fact, as long as people are able to count their money, this will be true (pun intended). The real question here is, were the 99% in India comparable to the 99% in Europe? Here, again, the answer is simple, emphatic and NO. The average man in India had basic education as was the standard of his society, plus the knowledge to practice his proffered profession. The caste system is seen as an oppressive model by many, and this is patently false. The caste system turned on itself, and became oppressive, when outside factors (read: well, you know who) started putting the squeeze on the socio-economic model prevalent in India. Until such time, the caste system ensured order in society. Tell me this, wise critic of the caste system: do you acknowledge that India was always a land of free thinkers and intellectuals? If so, do you know that this oppressive system survived for millennia in such a society? Do you really think these two ideas reconcile? The caste system ensured that everyone had a place in society. Unlike today, when one man can own and control everything, in ancient India, you could not. You could only practice your profession, and every profession was respected and specialized. There were no corporate's, and no feudal lords of the kind you know existed in Europe. Everyone earned their living, and was allowed to do so. Economic freedom, and self sufficiency, was the basis of living. The Indian Village Economy is pretty famous for how independent it was in the past. Not to mention India was choked full of resources, fertile agricultural land, was a center of trade in the region....I could keep going on... And we are not talking royal treasuries like the one at Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Kerala. So, better average education, economic independence, as close to job security as you could get those days...the average Indian was a whole lot better economically than the average European who was....well, riddled with everything. Think Dark Ages. So yes, India was rich, filthy stinking rich, in every way imaginable. The GDP part of things is....verifiable, so go ahead and do so. The average person part...similarly verifiable. To give just a couple of figures, in the 1700's, India's population was roughly ~150 million, which is about a quarter of the population of the known world at that time, to go with a quarter of the world's GDP. Nobody suffering the grip of poverty then. Interestingly, Europe at that time had, as a whole, about the same share of GDP, and a smaller population, if you can believe that. And by smaller, I mean smaller by a lot, like 50 million less. But the other factors we would have to consider when estimating the economic condition of an average person, do not flatter the European scenario. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's clear a few misconceptions first.  India wasn't so rich that \"gold coins were sold on the streets like vegetables.\" No. India was moderately wealthy and prosperous according to the era.  Again, did India have a large share of the world's GDP before the British conquest? Yes it did, along with China. But then again, the way we present the data is quite weird. India as a country didn't exist then, and besides, we compare our GDP with that of tiny countries like Britain, France and Spain, who had a fraction of our population and territory. If we compared the Chinese region, the Indian subcontinent and the European continent, by 1700, all three regions had an equal share of the world GDP. But we know that GDP is not a reliable estimate of wealth.  Was India rich? Yes, some people in India were filthy rich - kings, nobles, landlords, merchants, temple priests. Were many Indians living in horrible conditions? Yes, they were. When we say that India was rich, we like to think that all Indians were uniformly wealthy. When even Western countries do not have equitable economies despite not having caste system, how can we imagine India to have had an equitable economy?  We can look at this issue from a different angle. India had very fertile lands and high agricultural productivity - on par with China and Japan, and more than Europe but not by so much. India had a flourishing manufacturing sector comprised mostly of artisans, again, similar to Chinese, Japanese, Ottoman and West European societies. As Prasannan Parthasarathi has pointed out, the quality of our artisans was very high, and Indian goods, especially textiles and ships, were very highly sought after. He even argues that we were on the verge of our own Industrial Revolution.  When we say that the British looted India, they actually took all the agricultural surplus, which would generally have been invested in the domestic economy, out of India. They also destroyed the artisan class and dismantled our manufacturing, making us completely reliant on British manufacturers.  Do not make the mistake of thinking that all Indians lived luxurious lives before the British arrived here. At the same time, do understand that India has always been understood by the West as one of the wealthiest regions of the world, because of high agricultural productivity and excellent manufacturing quality, as well as because of the sheer opulence of the upper class comprising of kings, nobles, landlords, etc, and because of the huge amounts of gold found in temples. Edit: For further reading, I would really suggest the following books The Cambridge Economic History of India, Volume I, c. 1200 - c. 1750Douglas Streusand - Islamic Gunpowder Empires - Ottomans, Safavids, MughalsPrasannan Parthasarathi - Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not Also, I've written an answer on the Mughal economy which might have some bearing on this issue: Shyam Sundar Sridhar's answer to What was the Indian economy like in the time of the Mughals?

            "answer_text": "First of all I am utterly shocked by the rhetoric on Quora. Guys there is a place called Twitter for rhetoric. Everyone is putting up claims (Some of it are true!) without any evidence. So let's stick to facts and some basic research material. YES, India was indeed the World's largest economy. I will answer this question in two parts. The second part also includes my personal experience which some of you might dismiss as lack of evidence but part I has irrefutable references attached to it. I. Economic Perspective: Prof. Agnus Maddison A British economist named Agnus Maddison,  Professor Emeritus, University of Groningen authored a book titled \"The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective\". Using the modern techniques and his own research on ancient economics he claims that India has been the largest economy in the World until 17th Century A.D. Economic history of India (3rd Paragraph) The link to the book can be found below.The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective (Development Centre Studies): Angus Maddison: 9789264186088: Amazon.com: Books Mentioned below is an estimate of GDP(%) of the major economies in the World from the past two Millennium.     Image Link: Angus Maddison Further in his website a tabulation table claims that India and China controlled 50% of the World's GDP until late 1700s. The link to this table is mentioned below. It is from the personal website of Prof. Maddison. He is no more and I am not sure who is maintaining the website now. Page on theworldeconomy.org II. History Perspective: Vijayanagara Empire If you come down south you will be familiarized with Shri Krishnadevaraya, a king of Vijayanagara dynasty (1509-29) who ruled the present day South India. He is credited for many military successes and praised for giving patronage to Hinduism and see it through turbulent times. Not many know that present day Goa was his gift to the Portuguese. He even had two Portuguese Ambassadors in his court. The book titled \"A Forgotten Empire: A contribution to the Histroy of India\" written by Robert Sewell details the chronicles of the Portuguese ambassadors to India, Paes and Nunes. In that he clearly mentions that precious jems were sold on the streets of Vijayanagara (modern day Hampi). Further, he also mentions that Hampi was looted for 6 months after its fall aftermath the Battle of Rakkasatangadi. Once news reached Vijayanagara that they have lost the battle, all the wealth was loaded on to hundreds of elephants which marched South to seek refuge is Travancore (modern day Thiruvananthapuram). Below is the link to the book: Amazon.com: A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): a contribution to the history of India eBook: Robert Sewell, Domingos Paes, Fern\u00e3o Nunes: Kindle Store If you visit Hampi there's an office maintained by Archaeological Survey of India on Ratha beedi (Chariot Street) where all the precious stones were supposedly sold. Inside the ASI office there is catalogue that has photograph of old paintings for sale. Those old paintings depict the ancient day Vijayanagara and people selling precious stones in Ratha Beedi. This era was literally the golden era for Southern India. This is just one of many possible examples of prosperous empire in ancient India. Were we filthy rich? YES. Was everyone rich? Perhaps not. A moment of silence for our Marxist history which never really taught anything about our country's true past.  I am ashamed to say I do not know most of the Indian history nor to most of the Indians. III. Purvapaksha (Counter-View) We have to keep in mind that there are always two sides to the argument. In order to maintain rationality and to remain factual it is important to analyze the other side of the argument. The below link presents an interesting counter argument The Myth of India's \"stolen\" GDP and wealth The author argues that the higher GDP % of India and China is simply because of relatively high population. He also argues that ancient Western and Middle Eastern economies had better per capita as per the estimates of Prof. Maddison! ",

            "answer_text": "I see that many have answered this question. It was something I used to ponder about when I first started reading about the Indian Freedom struggle. Over time, I was fairly convinced that it was perhaps one of the worst phase in the history of my Country.This speech was what put the final nail in the coffin for me. How a Debate Was Won in London Against British Colonization of India, by Shashi Tharoor.  Mind you, he is one of the most well read men in the World. This is a short summary of what happened that day during the Debate that I was able to pull off the NDTV website. As told by the man himself - Last week, on the very day that Scotland was deciding its future, six of us gathered in London to debate the past.  To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the British presence in India -- King James I's envoy, Sir Thomas Roe, arrived at the court of Emperor Jehangir in 1614 -- the Indo-British heritage Trust held a debate, in the chamber of the UK Supreme Court, on the motion \"This House believes that the Indian subcontinent benefited more than it lost from the experience of British colonialism.\" Needless to say, I spoke against, alongside two Indophile Brits, authors William Dalrymple and Nick Robins. The proposers were Pakistan's Niloufer Bakhtyar, an editor, Martin Bell, former BBC war correspondent, and Kwasi Kwarteng, a Conservative Party MP of African descent.  It was a lively affair. As the debate began, its Chair, Labour MP Keith Vaz, called for an initial vote, which went 35 to 28 for the motion. When it was over, voting took place again, and the needle had moved dramatically: 26 to 42 against. The anti-colonialists had carried the day. Why was our case so compelling? At the beginning of the 18th century India's share of the world economy was 23%, as large as all of Europe put together. By the time we won independence, it had dropped to less than 4%. The reason was simple: India was governed for the benefit of Britain. Britain's rise for 200 years was financed by its depredations in India. Britain's Industrial Revolution was built on the de-industrialisation of India - the destruction of Indian textiles and their replacement by manufacturing in England, using Indian raw material and exporting the finished products back to India and the rest of the world. The handloom weavers of Bengal had produced and exported some of the world's most desirable fabrics, especially cheap but fine muslins, some light as \"woven air\". Britain's response was to cut off the thumbs of Bengali weavers, break their looms and impose duties and tariffs on Indian cloth, while flooding India and the world with cheaper fabric from the new satanic steam mills of Britain. Weavers became beggars, manufacturing collapsed; the population of Dhaka, which was once the great centre of muslin production, fell by 90%. So instead of a great exporter of finished products, India became an importer of British ones, while its share of world exports fell from 27% to 2%.  Colonialists like Robert Clive bought their \"rotten boroughs\" in England with the proceeds of their loot in India (loot, by the way, was a word they took into their dictionaries as well as their habits), while publicly marvelling at their own self-restraint in not stealing even more than they did. And the British had the gall to call him \"Clive of India\", as if he belonged to the country, when all he really did was to ensure that much of the country belonged to him. By the end of the 19th century, India was Britain's biggest cash-cow, the world's biggest purchaser of British exports and the source of highly paid employment for British civil servants - all at India's own expense. We literally paid for our own oppression. As Britain ruthlessly exploited India, between 15 and 29 million Indians died tragically unnecessary deaths from starvation. The last large-scale famine to take place in India was under British rule; none has taken place since, since free democracies don't let their people starve to death. Some four million Bengalis died in the Great Bengal Famine of 1943 after Winston Churchill deliberately ordered the diversion of food from starving Indian civilians to well-supplied British soldiers and European stockpiles. \"The starvation of anyway underfed Bengalis is less serious\" than that of \"sturdy Greeks\", he argued. When officers of conscience pointed out in a telegram to the Prime Minister the scale of the tragedy caused by his decisions, Churchill's only response was to ask peevishly \"why hasn't Gandhi died yet?\" British imperialism had long justified itself with the pretense that it was enlightened despotism, conducted for the benefit of the governed. Churchill's inhumane conduct in 1943 gave the lie to this myth. But it had been battered for two centuries already: British imperialism had triumphed not just by conquest and deception on a grand scale but by blowing rebels to bits from the mouths of cannons, massacring unarmed protestors at Jallianwallah Bagh and upholding iniquity through institutionalised racism. Whereas as late as the 1940s it was possible for a black African to say with pride, \"moi, je suis francais\", no Indian in the colonial era was ever allowed to feel British; he was always a subject, never a citizen. What are the arguments FOR British colonialism benefiting the subcontinent? It is often claimed that the British bequeathed India its political unity. But India had enjoyed cultural and geographical unity throughout the ages, going back to Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC and Adi Shankara travelling from Kerala to Kashmir and from Dwarka to Puri in the 7th century AD, establishing his temples everywhere. As a result, the yearning for political unity existed throughout; warriors and kings tried to dominate the entire subcontinent, usually unsuccessfully. But with modern transport and communications, national unity would have been fulfilled without colonial rule, just as in equally fragmented 19th century Italy. And what political unity can we celebrate when the horrors of Partition (1 million dead, 13 million displaced, billions of rupees of property destroyed) were the direct result of deliberate British policies of \"divide and rule\" that fomented religious antagonisms?  The construction of the Indian Railways is often pointed to as benefit of British rule, ignoring the obvious fact that many countries have built railways without having to be colonized to do so. Nor were the railways laid to serve the Indian public. They were intended to help the British get around, and above all to carry Indian raw materials to the ports to be shipped to Britain. The movement of people was incidental except when it served colonial interests; no effort was made to ensure that supply matched demand for mass transport. In fact the Indian Railways were a big British colonial scam. British shareholders made absurd amounts of money by investing in the railways, where the government guaranteed extravagant returns on capital, paid for by Indian taxes. Thanks to British rapacity, a mile of Indian railways cost double that of a mile in Canada and Australia. It was a splendid racket for the British, who made all the profits, controlled the technology and supplied all the equipment, which meant once again that the benefits went out of India. It was a scheme described at the time as \"private enterprise at public risk\". Private British enterprise, public Indian risk. The English language comes next on the credit list. It too was not a deliberate gift but an instrument of colonialism. As Macaulay explained the purpose of English education: \"We must do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indians in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.\" The language was taught to a few to serve as intermediaries between the rulers and the ruled. That we seized the English language and turned it into an instrument for our own liberation was to our credit, not by British design. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------I strongly suggest you take a look at the entire video of the debate because it will show you how he was able to decimate the points put forth by those favoring the British rule in India. It is debating at its purest and best. Needless to say, he got a standing ovation for it that day.Five minutes was all it took him to take the entire issue apart and put things into perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "To analyze the economic condition before British invasion we need to look at economy immediately before British invasion that is Mughal period. Economy of any nation during a particular period can be gauged by condition of common man vis-a-vis agriculture, trade, Technology and education. Let\u2019s have a look at each one by one.1.      General structure and common man: Moreland was the first to arrive at a demographic calculation with the help of Ain-i-Akbari and concluded that the population of northern India was 30 to 40 million people at the end of the 16th century.He also concludes that the population of entire India was 100 million at the end of AD 1600. It is now agreed upon that the population at the end of Akbar\u2019s reign could be 100 million and the whole of India 145 million. Out of this population, by using the method of pattern of consumption of agricultural produce conclusion can be drawn that the urban population could be over 15 per cent of the total population and the rest of the population belongs to the rural setup. We come to know from Nizamuddin Ahmed\u2019s Tabaquat-i-Akhari that in Akbar\u2019s empire existed 120 big towns and 32,000 townships. Contemporary European travelers also record the population of various big towns like Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Surat, Patna, Dacca and Masulipatnam, where the estimated population is given the maximum of 5, 00,000 in Delhi and Agra, Lahore as 4, 00,000, and 2, 00,000 in the towns of Surat, Patna, Dacca and Masulipatnam. Another interesting aspect to be noted was that the rate of the growth of the population was 0.2 in the 17th and 18th centuries. Before the arrival of the British, much of the Indian population lived in villages and they maintained a predominantly agricultural economy. Farmers did not usually live on their land but went to the fields daily to work the land to provide food for their villages. Villagers were also able to pay their taxes with their produce. Textiles, crafts and spices were exchanged with traders.2.      Agriculture & Trade: According to Ibn Batuta, a traveller who came from North Africa in India during the fourteenth century, agriculture was in a state of great progress. The soil was so fertile that it produced two crops every year; rice being sown three times a year. Sesame, sugar-cane and cotton were grown in abundance and these formed the basis of several village industries. Rice of Sarsauti, sugar-cane of Kanauj, wheat and betel leaf of Malwa, wheat of Gwalior, ginger and spices of Malabar, grapes and pomegranates of Daultabad, betel nuts of the South India and a large variety of oranges were popular in and outside India. We have ample evidence provided by Ain-i-Akbari and other documents of the period as well as of the European travelers\u2019 accounts to have a good knowledge of the economy of the Mughal state till the end of the great Mughals and the lesser Mughals. The view held by British as well as Indian historians was that ordinary labourer was happier in those days than today. Ain-i-Akbari gives a list of the cost of food stuff like rice, wheat, barley, vegetables, sugar, and sheep and cow. The cost was cheap and the wages too were meagre but as their availability was much in vogue, people could purchase and be satisfied.It is no exaggeration to surest that there was abundance of agricultural products which enabled even the common people to fill their belly satisfactorily. Besides agricultural production, non-agricultural production of textiles, indigo, sugar, oil and various crafts received new heights. Abul Fazl provides a list of important centres of production of cotton textiles like Gujarat, Rajasthan, UP, Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, Masulipatnam and the Coromandal Coast. In this age, thus, we notice abundance of commodity production in different regions of the country. As the volume of production was very much higher than the local demand and consumption, the surplus of production was turned to trade and commerce. The relative political stability and increased surplus production gave a fillip to trading activities. The entry of foreigners too increased both the inland and foreign trade. Ahmedabad, Surat, Dhaka, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Ajmer, Thatta, Burhanpur, Masulipatnam, Bijapur, Hyderabad, Calicut and Cochin were big trading centres of all commodities. In those days, imports were very little and there were export of considerable Indian goods like textiles, indigo, spices and saltpetre.3.      Technology: Pre British invasion age did not witness any breathtaking discoveries in the fields of different branches of science. One of the renowned scientists of Akbar\u2019s time was Mir Fatullah Shirazi and he is credited with the invention of mechanical devices and the introduction of a true solar calendar (Illahi) exposed to the European learning; the impact of the European learning did not penetrate into the areas of Indian sciences. In the sphere of agricultural technology we do not notice any radical change with regard to the tools of agricultural operations like the plough, ploughshare and sickle, but as one significant development to be recorded is the introduction of some new crops, plants and fruits. Historian P.K. Code is of the view that grafting became a common practice in India after AD 1550. As a result, new varieties of mango, Alfanso, Our Lady and Joani Perriera developed in India. Of all the Mughal emperors, Shahjahan appears to have built two canals \u2013 Nahr Faiz and Shah Nahr. During his period, in the sphere of textile technology, carpet weaving and production of silk and silk fabrics became popular.4.      Education: The Education system in pre British invasion period was largely based on education system implemented by Mughal rule. Mughal period during Akbar was in advance of his age and made an attempt to raise the intellectual level of the people. Although Mughal rule did not establish a network of schools and colleges all over the country for the benefit of the school-going population and did not allocate a fixed percentage of the state revenue for expenditure on education, he encouraged education in diverse ways. The Mughal education system consisted of primary and secondary schools, and even colleges. Some of them were established and maintained by Mughal government, while others depended upon private philanthropy. There was a maktab or primary school attached to every mosque where elementary reading, writing and arithmetic, besides the religious education.During the Akbar\u2019s reign important changes were introduced in the syllabus of education through the efforts of Shah Fathullah Shirazi.Islamic schools were attached to mosques, Khanqah of the Sufis and tombs. Special buildings were also constructed for imparting education. Their expenses were met from endowments. During the Mughal period the principal centres of learning were at Lahore,Delhi,Ajmer,Sialkot,Multan,Ahmadabad,Allahabad,Lucknow,Murshidabad,Dacca.Many scholars were attracted to these institutions from Persia and Central Asia. Students received education free of cost. Famous scholars received fixed stipends from the royal treasury. Nizamiyah system of education became popular during the later days of the Mughals. The aim of this system was to create such ability in the scholar so that he is able to acquire perfection in any branch of learning through self-study and personal efforts. While Muslims received education in Maktabs,Hindus had their pathsalas for imparting religious instructions. During the Mughal period, girls received their education at home or in the house of some teacher living in close proximity. There were special arrangements for the education of the ladies of the royal household, and some of the princesses were distinguished scholars. Vocational education was imparted through a system ofapprenticeship either in the house of ust\u0101ds (teachers) or in k\u0101rkh\u0101nahs (manufacturing centres).From analysis of above key economic indicators following general observations may be made about the economic and the general conditions of the people in pre British period. Freedom to choose occupation. People were free to choose their occupation.Agriculture as the main occupation: A very substantial portion of India\u2019s population depended upon agriculture. Self sufficiency of villages: The villages produced articles of daily use in such a way, that they were able to meet their requirements.Barter as well as currency system: Barter system along with currency was also very popular in the rural areas.Low prices: In general, it is observed that the prices of essential commodities were quite low.More export than imports.Non agricultural production was also full fledged and production was more than local demand and consumption. Surplus production was traded to other countries.Education was not modern nor it included any appreciable scientific content like Europeans system during the same period but it included linguistic, cultural, moral and arithmetical studies and more importantly was not commercialised like modern British era where scientific and modern education became accessible to only privileged few. Now coming to impact of British rule on Indian agriculture, trade and industry:1.      British colonialism weakened agriculture and \u201cdeindustrialized\u201d India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.2.      Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule \u201cde-industrialised\u201d India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.3.      Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.4.      Britain's main failure was not to impart modern scientific education to the Indian masses\u2014hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate. British invasion gave India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace\u2014the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. ",

            "answer_text": "That view has elements of truth, but is not entirely honest. Firstly, the area that we now refer to as India, did control a large proportion of the world\u2019s GDP. But the general trend since about the first century AD was that it had been in gradual decline, and this decline had been slowly accelerating, the growth in the 1600\u2019s is an anomaly in relative terms  It\u2019s also important to point out that although India did control a vast amount of the world\u2019s wealth, this doesn't mean that everyone was wealthy. The wealth was generally concentrated towards an extremely wealthy economic elite. In terms of wealth on a per capita basis, it was among the poorest performers in 1700 and before.   So overall, India had a substantial amount of wealth, and some people were fabulously wealthy, but it wasn\u2019t a tale of luxury for all. Now to address the common view that Britain looted India and caused its economic decline. There are elements of truth to this, but I disagree with the assessment that Britain was entirely responsible for India\u2019s falling share of global wealth. Britain did loot India wherever possible, but not to the extent where it caused an economic decline. What did occur in India wasn\u2019t necessarily a decline, but rather a stagnation. As you can see from the GDP per capita graphs, the GDP per capita remained relatively stable from 1700 until the 1980\u2019s. India, as well as China was always destined to lose its dominant share of the world\u2019s GDP to Europe and the US since these places began to go through an industrial revolution, which vastly increased their economic productivity. Even without British interference, it is unlikely that India was anywhere near mass industrialization, the factors simply weren\u2019t in place. The factors that prohibited an Industrial Revolution in India at the time included low wages, high energy costs, political instability (even before the Europeans arrived), lack of a widespread capitalist entrepreneurial culture, lack of centralized government support and friendly regulations for businesses, and the fact that it had fallen slightly behind in terms of technology. Because of this India inevitably lost a good amount of its GDP share to economies that were industrializing. British colonialism did have an adverse economic impact, especially in its timing,the looting, and the fact that it did divert much of India\u2019s agricultural surplus. I suppose the only true benefits were the railroad, largely built by labouring Indians, and the fact that the UK inadvertently created the concept of a united Indian state. However, as much as this did hold India back, it wasn\u2019t to the disastrous extent that many like the suggest. The UK did contribute the stagnation, but there were many other important factors that had nothing to do with the British. To level all of India\u2019s economic woes on the UK is simply disingenuous.

            "answer_text": "Boss, read the true history before speaking Economic loss :- India\u2019s GDP before the British came : 27% of World GDP in 1700. India\u2019s GDP when British left India in 1947: 3% of World GDP. When British left us in 1947 our literary rate was 12% today 74% and still increasing. Our life expectancy was 27 and today 70 and still increasing. 90% live below poverty line when British left us in 1947 and today 2.9%. It's far better than 90%. In 2025 poverty will be vanished from India. We have long way to go but today's situation is far far better than in 1947. 90% poverty, 12% literacy and 27 life expectancy in 1947 when British left us....can you imagine this?? Nowadays situation is far better no doubt but we have still long way to go. And people talk about why there's so much poverty. One thing I want to tell them that if you don't know past then you can't understand present. I don't blame those people but their government is hiding colonial history and that's the main problem because they don't know the real reason behind our poverty. If they know it then they don't ask those questions. India lifted 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016, says United Nations (India lifted 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016, says United Nations) India may get rid of extreme poverty by 2030, under 3% to remain poor by 2020: Report (India may get rid of extreme poverty by 2030, under 3% to remain poor by 2020: Report) India\u2019s pulled at least 170 million people out of poverty since 1990 (India\u2019s pulled at least 170 million people out of poverty since 1990) British Raj siphoned out $45 trillion from India: Utsa Patnaik (British Raj siphoned out $45 trillion from India: Utsa Patnaik) World Poverty Clock (World Poverty Clock)      ",

            "answer_text": "There is no doubt that India was having more wealth than any other country. However the question is wheather it was only in the hands of kings or the people were infact rich. The answer is not easy, coz it relates to a period when the parameter of richness was not so simple (atleast in India). Back at that time traditional indian systems were in practice without much interference from mugals or any other past rulars. In my view this system ensures everyone atleast gets what he requires & not more not less & excess go to king who is responsible for state welfare. Yes I am talking about caste system.In this systemKing - Always rich, no clarification required if have doubt read previous answers people have given enough examples Bharmin - He can demand anything from anybody including the king & he also gets it but his vedic education (which was almost must for them) make him think that he is above every thing & everyone, as a result he spent life in proving himself above others including the king, in the process often proclaim that money (maya) is nothing for him.  The usually work in profession like teaching (including religion), research, medical, consulting the king & wealthy. He just want respect & not much money but requirement always taken care of by othrer with quite margin. So he is wealthy. Kshatriya - He is the warrior and thought by the bharmin that his responsibility is only for motherland. he has to do something for the land like his forefathers done (always exists the story of forefathers bravery & kindness mostly in records of bharmins). Profession mostly military, requirement taken care by state by way of good salary. Vaishya -  Only people dealing in money and were generally wealthy, high taxes mostly levied on these people, they used to do yatra & all the donations (till today you can observe the drastic difference between travelling habit of gujrati's & others). Just visit Mathura, Banaras, haridwar etc we \"pandas\" have records of upto 500 years of visits in these places with donation for \"dharmshalas\", temples etc. I belive our Bania's were the first expoters of the world & were the responsible for attraction towards India.So they were also wealthy. Harijan (Shudra) - this part is difficult to explain bcoz Iam a bharmin & some one will read my surname and can easily accuse me of anything. but belive me our system was such that they get enough without geting any cash money. They used to do jobs which were of utmost importance but were not considered to be done by others, for this they were mostly paid in \"bater\" (kind).  I can just give an example which may be able to convince,However this is entirely based on what I have seen in 1990es and am sure practised from last 200 yrs, (any body pls check if such things were common)I live in a Mohalla in mathura, we used to have a elderly lady called \"bahu\"by all(even by people younger then her).She used to clean the road & older kind manual W/C in each house though many families like us have installed flush toilets but there was enough dirty work . She use to get only Rs 1 p.a from each house which was increased to Rs 5 p.a. Our mohalla has 20 house & she has 4 such muhallas so the total annual income from 80 houses Rs 80 P.a or 400 pa when increased. However, we had a tradition of making a roti everyday ermarked for her. Cloths from each house on fastivals. And yes on every occation from birth to death, in all the 16 sanskars, she has some role to play for which she get something. As she has acess to 80 houses for all these stuff, she use to plan accordingly for her family.I think it is enough remuneration but i also know some thing are such that only money can buy like Education, stuffs at home.  To that extent yes they were deficient but I am damn sure that Hunger was a rare phenomena. On the basis of my above understanding I \"belive\" we were quite well before angrez came here. ",

            "answer_text": "Rich is a relative concept and prior to colonialism, India was one of the largest countries by GDP. In ancient societies, prosperity was largely linked to agricultural productivity and some areas of India like Bengal were some of the most productive, and hence the wealthiest regions of the world. To speak of \u201cIndia\u201d overall hides many of the variations in a country that large. One of the answers previously cites Angus Maddison, a British historian known for GDP estimates going back to 1 AD. Such estimates should be taken with a grain of salt and Angus in particular has been criticized for over-extrapolation from limited data. I am not privy to what biases Angus may have had as a western historian but his line of reasoning is common amongst colonial apologists who love to jump on reasons why colonialism \u201cwas not that bad\u201d. That answer also cites India\u2019s wealth at 1820 as evidence that colonialism was not harmful - this is incorrect as in 1820 large parts of India were still very lightly colonized, was under control of East India Co instead of the crown, and the most pernicious effects of colonialism had barely been felt. Instead of inaccurate GDP measures, we can see the decline of India during colonialism through more concrete events such as famines. Bengal for example had many more famines as soon as the British took over and this was not due to a sudden change in climate but in the extremely exploitative nature of their rule. Overtaxation and a focus on extractive industries such as cash crops was a hallmark of British rule and its subsequent destruction of rural economies. The real effects of these policies was felt in the late 1800s with famines that killed millions across India especially the Deccan as British policies forced farmers to grow cash crops pushing staple crops to marginal lands. It is no accident that some of Gandhi\u2019s earliest disobedience actions addressed the forced primacy of cash crops such as Indigo in my home state of Bihar. In today\u2019s world this is similar to narco-states such as Junta ruled Myanmar where farmers were forced to grow opium. \u201cLate Victorian Holocausts\u201d by Mike Davis is a fantastic read on these topics. British rule destroyed the fabric of rural society in India and left a nation starving and impoverished while during famines gold and wheat were exported to the mother country. The railroads that British apologists love to cite as examples of \u201cdevelopment\u201d were built on routes designed for export of raw goods and exacerbated famines as food was shipped for export markets when local populations could no longer feed themselves. The frequency of famines during the 200 years of British rule was considerably higher than in the 1000 years prior - to me that is a prime example of getting poorer. Whitewashing of British history has led us to believe these were all natural causes but even a cursory read of British policies around that time make it clear these were MAN-MADE and even after the famine was in full swing, British policy was as callous as it had been in Ireland with the potato famine, if not worse. Beyond rural economies, previously flourishing industries such as textiles were suppressed to support industry back in Manchester and Leeds leading to massive deindustrialization across India. \u201cEmpire of Cotton\u201d by Sven Beckert is a great read looking at history through the lens of cotton, the mainstay industry across most of the world till the industrial revolution. To come back to the original question, yes India was rich before British misrule, at least how rich was conceived in older societies. It was certainly richer than the disaster that British misrule left India in after 200 years. In the 200 years of British rule Indian per capita income barely moved up while countries across Europe and Japan went up by orders of magnitude while the frequency of famines and deindustrialization of industries such as steel and cotton continued unabated.

On the other hand everybody goes around blaming the muslims & British for our sorry state of affairs they choose to ignore the fact that 99% of the population lived in villages in 1947 so what economy are they talking about?The DNA of dishonesty and deceit seems to exists even after hundreds of years of enslavement in the same way that the qualities of hard work and honesty persist even after all is lost. What is really shameful is that 80% of the population still defecates in the open and does not use tissue paper. ",

Even after they realised they their mistake, Westerners still called the natives of North, South and Central America \u2018Indians\u2019 because this land was as rich as they had hoped to find in India!!! Portuguese sailed past the \u2018dark continent\u2019 seeking India and its fabulous wealth. If they were simply seeking adventure, they could have had plenty of that in Africa! But they sought India, because India was the source of spices, silks, gold and gems. If that wasn\u2019t the fact, why did they risk life and limb by sailing across uncharted waters to find us? As Nishanth S Swaroop, Shyam Sundar Sridhar, Nikhil Sharma, Rahul Sathyajit, Asif Eqbal, Viswanath Ajikumar and several others have given very eloquent answers with stats, figures and links about wealth of India in pre-European times. I will let you read that yourself. All I will add here is, the Europeans looted our natural resources, broke our native industries, dismantled our institutions and insulted in the bargain by adding us to their \u2018commonwealth\u2019 - ie our wealth was their and their wealth was out of reach of the pagan natives.
