            "answer_text": "Britain created the modern state of India, first the British befriended the Mughals, the Mughals were coming to an end around that time, before Britain there were many different territories in India\u2019s place, Britain slowly united all of India and created India of what it is now. The British built railways, courts, roads, libraries, schools, education facilities, prisons, factories, ports, and much much more. The British tried to make India in Britain\u2019s image with at the same time respecting Hindu culture. India was once an extremely rich country, under the Mughal Empire, however, with the decline of the Mughals, the people of the Mughal territory suffered immensely. The period of the Great Mughals, began in 1526 with Babur\u2019s accession to the throne, and ended with the death of Aurangzeb in 1707. Aurangzeb\u2019s death marked the end of an era in Indian history. When Aurangzeb died, the empire of the Mughals was the largest in India. Yet, within about fifty years of his death, the Mughal Empire disintegrated. Back to the British, having already met with the leadership of the Mughals who granted permission to set up the East India Company, in 1608 AD, the East India Company sent Captain William Hawkins to the court of the Mughal emperor Jahangir to secure royal patronage. He succeeded in getting royal permit for the Company to establish its factories at various places on the Western coast of India. Then in 1615 AD, Sir Thomas Roe was sent by Emperor James I of England to Jahangir\u2019s court, with a plea for more concession for the Company. Roe was very diplomatic and thus successfully secured a royal charter giving the Company freedom to trade in the whole of the Mughal territory. There was enormous rivalry with the Dutch, French and Portuguese, but the British allegiance with the Muslim Mughal Kingdom gave Britain the edge over other European rivals. The decisive moment for the British came in 1662 AD, when Charles II of England married a Portuguese princess Katherine, and received the island of Bombay as dowry which he immediately gave to the East India Company in 1668 AD for 10 pounds per year. The Company on the West coast shifted its business headquarters from Surat to Bombay (Mumbai). In 1639 AD, the East India Company obtained the lease of the city of Madras from the local king where it built Fort St. George to protect its factory. Later Madras was made the South Indian headquarters of the Company. After establishing its factories in south and west India, the company started to focus on east India particularly Bengal a significant province Mughal empire. The governor of Bengal Sujauddaula in 1651 AD, allowed the English Company to carry out its trade activities in Bengal. A factory in Hugli was established and three villages -Sutanati, Govindapur and Kolkata- were purchased in 1698 AD by the Company to build a factory over there. Subsequently Fort William was raised in order to provide protection around the factory. The present day Kolkata grew and developed on this very site. The major reasons that helped the British to be established as ruling power during next two hundred years in India can be- inter alia -described as- the loss of central authority in India after the decline of the Mughal empire with the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 AD andthe prevailing political disunity among the Indian rulers, for instance, they often sought assistance from the British for their own security, which gave a golden opportunity to the foreigners to increasingly meddle in their internal affairs and take advantage of their weaknessesThe Portuguese, the Dutch, the British and the French were the four major European powers who arrived in India to establish their trade links and subsequently held colonial possessions. Major well as minor conflicts among them often took place from time to time for commercial and political supremacy but in the end it were the British who proved themselves most powerful after thrashing the other three and remained in India for more than 200 years as ruling power. The Portuguese, who were the first to come to India, set up their factories and colonial posts here and faced stiff competition from the Dutch but the Dutch proved weak before them as they could not withstand the stiff competition of the Portuguese and the British and thus retired from India. Ever since the British came to India they faced challenges from the Europeans powers like the Dutch, the Portuguese and the French. The Portuguese and the Dutch were not serious and potent rivals to the British. The only strong rival of the British were the French who were also the last Europeans to come to India. The British efforts to establish a complete monopoly over trade and commerce in India again and again brought them into conflict with the French. Consequently three long battles were fought between these two European powers during a period of 20 years (1744 AD-1763 AD) with the aim of capturing commercial as well as territorial control. The final decisive battle was fought on 22 January, 1763 AD at Wandiwash. It was the succession disputes in both the Carnatic and Hyderabad that opened the gates for Europeans- the British and the French- to play the roles of middlemen and thus in order to grind their axe both European powers had a golden opportunity for intervention in support of various rival Indian claimants. At first the French, under Dupleix who was a governor of Pondicherry emerged victorious both in the Carnatic and in Hyderabad. The French were rewarded with Northern Sarkars by their claimant to throne which the French officer Bussy controlled for seven years. However the French success turned out to be short lived. They were checked by British forces under Robert Clive in 1751 AD. Robert Clive changed the course of the war. The French claimant was defeated the next year. The French had to sign the treaty of Tirucirapally with the British. In the next Seven Years\u2019 War (1756 AD\u2013 1763 AD)-third Carnatic War-both the French and British Armies renewed their rivalry. The war began when French General Count De Lally invaded Madras but was defeated by the British General Sir Eyre Coote. The British captured Pondicherry (1761 AD) and Count De Lally was forced to surrender Karaikal and Jinji to them. Hence, the French lost third Carnatic War at Wandiwash (1760 AD) and subsequently signed treaty of Paris with the British in Europe. This debacle in India (Britain\u2019s most loved, cherished, and prized asset) played in to the independence movement that occurred in the US just a few years later, and also is what led to European powers to support the British rebels in their fight for independence. The victory in Carnatic war prepared the ground for the British to establish their supremacy in India and the French dream of an Indian empire disappeared for ever. With the victory of Wandiwash the British East India Company had no European rival left in India. The British became the master of this great country. Besides having skilled leaders like Sir Eyre Coote, Major Stringer Lawrence, Robert Clive on their side the British was also a strong naval power which was a decisive factor with them to become credible rulers of India, along with Britain\u2019s policy of hiring, training, and equipping local soldiers who proved an extremely valuable asset in fighting rival powers in India.

            "answer_text": "1. Railways, Infrastructure and Irrigation \u2013 While it\u2019s hard to say if we would have not got here without them, the Railway system, in particular, is hard to ignore. We still benefit from the work of the past, and many of our central stations are still a function of British Infrastructure. Our Rail system is incredibly complex and connects across several regions. 2. The English language \u2013 This is hard to measure, but you can put your money on this \u2013 Indians are across the globe because of this one skill (with a myriad of other factors too, of course) \u2013 But it is hard to dismiss that having access to the language made this much easier. The irony of course is this \u2013 Years of imperial rule across the world created the need for the language in the first place! 3. Abolishing certain practices \u2013 The Britons played a role in abolishing Sati, slavery and also reducing the number of local gangs and dacoits. 4. Skilled labourers \u2013 Given that the English had a penchant of exporting several items from India, we were left with skilled labour to look after our own post-independence. The Industrial age was entered into with the help of Britons.5. The Army \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this qualifies as a clear benefit, but the Army discipline and culture still embodies practices of pre-independence era. There\u2019s more of course \u2013 medical equipment, vaccines, postal services, etc. As with all things, this is a grey area \u2013 Would we have not reached this point without British Rule? Since most of the world was ruled by imperialists, are we simply benefiting because we gel with those who have ruled us in the first place? ",
