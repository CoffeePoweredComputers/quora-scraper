            "answer_text": "After living in Brazil for 17 years, as a Canadian, American and European by birth, I see a few problems in Brazil. Before I start I will say that every single country has problems, that no country is perfect, that every single country has problems in certain areas. Okay, with that said, here are my opinions, with the biggest problem first and reducing in importance as I go: There is a huge disparity between the social classes in Brazil. Minimum wage is very low, about $250 dollars a month. The average family makes around $650 dollars a month while about 10% of the population makes $3,000 to $10,000 a month or even more - these people lead exceptionally comfortable lives while a large proportion of the population suffer financially.The public education system isn\u2019t adequate enough for the poorer population, the middle class has to pay for private school for their children to get a decent education and therefore get a decent job. The government is investing billions in education, but there\u2019s still a ways to go yet.In certain neighborhoods crime is rampant, especially in Rio de Janeiro. The army often occupies the rampant neighborhoods and the poor inhabitants who have nothing to do with crime who live there often suffer the consequences brutally. Personally, I\u2019ve not been a victim of crime here, as most Brazilians who live far from these neighborhoods haven\u2019t been victims. Although, I must say, despite what the media and many native Brazilians might say who haven\u2019t traveled abroad, I feel much safer where I live and work now than when I grew up in Buffalo and Pittsburgh and lived Los Angeles and San Diego. I am not afraid to walk around after dark here. Although you\u2019re reading a post from someone who lived through the Summer of Sam in New York City, so it\u2019s all relative to the individual.Enforcement of the law is non-existent in parts of the country, and often lax in a good portion of the country. People basically do what they want and the police are benevolent. For the 99% of society that is honorable it works, it\u2019s the 1% who aren\u2019t that take advantage of the system who cause the problems. Thinking along these lines society is much freezer in Brazil than in the USA or other developed countries. Here I do what I want, how I want, when I want and nothing will happen to me. There is more freedom in anarchy than in a tightly controlled society.The country lacks infrastructure in certain areas. The farther inland from the coast you go the less infrastructure there is. There are towns without doctors or schools or water or electricity. Think of it like Northern Canada, there are vast areas where you are all alone in the wilderness without anything but yourself. Now apply this concept to enforcement, you can do pretty much do what you want in the wilderness and you won\u2019t get caught for it. Obviously, in the city it\u2019s not so easy.Brazil is so very far removed from the rest of the world geographically that what happens in the Northern hemisphere has little impact here and also visa-versa. That means that things take a little longer to change here, although with the internet as it is today, perceptions are changing rapidly and Brazilians are demanding change from their government. It\u2019s actually working too, to a certain extent.Brazil has a party culture, go to the beach and drink, throw a barbecue and make noise, dance at Carnaval until you drop in sweat, they are social people who love to touch in conversation, for an American this can be disconcerting, although it\u2019s not really a problem, it\u2019s actually a good thing because people relate to each other on an deeper emotional level here in Brazil in comparison to other countries - families are much closer to each other and support each other much more than families in Europe or America do.Despite the negative, for me Brazil has been amazing, the culture, the language, the way of living, everything about this place carries has carried a unique and certain magic to it for me. I can\u2019t explain it, you\u2019ll have to visit to catch a glimpse and you\u2019ll have to live here for a long time to truly understand. Brazilians are happy people, despite their problems. They love their country and even if they immigrate somewhere else, Brazil always lives in their heart. I find that beautiful\u2026 it\u2019s just like the American expat who loves the states or the Canadian who loves Canada and goes to another place. Their country will always be theirs, but where they live can also become special to them. I hope that you enjoyed this post and that you are able to see that it\u2019s not unsafe here\u2026 Visit if you can, it\u2019s well worth the trip, I know, I\u2019ve lived here. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to contribute inspired by the other great answers. First of all, and maybe the main cause: \"Corruption, and bad administration. The best country with the worst  government.\"The user of power to their own benefit. I think corruption is the worst and maybe the cause of the others. The only thing you can go against this is voting on good politians for most difficult they are to find.  But who are the guilty of choosing this government? The people. And the peple has the government that their deserves. Bad government generates no alphabetized people. No alphabetized people generates bad government. It's a snowball. Our fees is equal to the top nations of the world, but there are too much corruption and incredible bad administration. The money never came back. Economist says that we are currently good economically for one reason: luck. Because we hadn't made any plan to achieve it. We are the country of the \"Plan B\", because we never have a \"Plan A\".  BureaucracyWith The Brazil cost . Everything is expensive. So, how can we compete? Very difficult, but not impossible, see Vale, InBev, Petrobr\u00e1s, Souza Cruz, WEG, Embraco, etc.We are one the few countries that have the figure of \"Contador\" just to lead with all fees, taxes in bureaucracy created by the government, that even the government doesn't  understand. The poor education systemChilds is the greatest treasure of a country. How are we taking care of ours?Sweden, Korea, Finland and some developed countries has the best salaries in education. Teachers earn like doctors.My India friend told me that his government created a tablet, the Aakash (tablet) to child have lectures online in their homes. Yes, so easy and simple, but what Brazil is doing?Brazilian government has no plans for the future, the teachers has one of the low salaries of the nation, different from other emergent countries. The horrible health systemA sick country can't work. And someone will need to work doubled. Social inequalityThere is no rich country with poor people.Recently treasures discovered: - Carajas Iron Ore Mine, the largest of the world. Brazilian news: O novo Eldorado da minera\u00e7\u00e3o. - Pre-salt layer the second greatest Oil resource ever being discovered. So rich and so poor at same time. How can we be? Because we are lucky, but bad administrators.  ConclusionHere is the best country to live if you can afford education, transport, healthcare, and don't depends of government for nothing. Our problems is just related to government. The people in general are good, and have good education, are tolerant and very friendly. When foreigns comes here, we threat them well, try to learn their language and culture. You'll find hospitality in almost all houses.And we improved in slow steps, but moving forward. An example: Ficha Limpa  Law, that bans outlaws from the government. Unbelievable this was accepted usually in 2012 year will all this information available. And millions of people finally went to the University, paying off course, but went. It's not soo god but it's a good starting point. *There are problems like violence, lack of infra structure, that are not root causes, but consequences, so I didn't listed.**I think everything will be fine in future. Ricardo Amorin economist said that at step we are walking, in 50 years we will be as developed as England. Will you wait to see it? ",
