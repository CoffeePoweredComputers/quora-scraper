            "answer_text": "No! Truth is the other way around. Ancient Italians, especially those from the northern half and even the Greek descended ones in the south all came from the black sea region as did most modern Europeans without large hunter-gatherer ancestry. Even during the Roman empire after Trajan conquered Dacia, 50k Dacian slaves were taken to Rome and within 3 generations began to dominate the later empire, working up through the military and and eventually providing upwards of 20 emperors including some of the very finest such as Justinian and Constantine the great. Dont think Justinian was that great? Well, Belisarius, his world-beating general who recovered most of the western empire including North Africa and the Eternal city of Rome ITSELF!!\u2026.was also 100% Dacian blood! Another emperor, Galerius (Dacian) was going to change the name of the empire to the Dacian empire, such was their dominance in Italian society by the 4th century and beyond. Of course the senate whined their way out of that embarrassing change and Galerius ultimately relented. There is a very good reason Trajan\u2019s forum was the home of 200 statues of captured Dacian warriors 3 meters tall and his own equestrian statue in the middle of his forum was not as big even on horseback\u2026..everybody was impressed by these hard men and powerful warriors the Dacians were. Google Dacian statues and look upon these mens' faces and tell me you aren't impressed! The Gauls, Brits, Germans, Jews, Parthians etc. never got anywhere near as much obvious respect. No wonder thracian (Dacian) emperors were so many and so effective! THATS FIRST-RATE BADASSERY!!! Thraco-Roman - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Romanians consider themselves a mixture of conquering romans (refering to the 2nd century roman conquest of Dacia by Trajan) and native dacians. They\u2019re well aware however that most of the conquering romans were of celtic, thracian, greek, etc heritage. Here for example is the \u2018\u2019origins make-up\u2019\u2019 of the roman auxiliaries in Dacia (ancient Romania), although the numbers for the legions themselves would have been very similar. Romans in Dacia \u2013 Balkan Celts  While many were italic, most were a mixture of celtic, thraco-illyrian, semitic, greek, etc So as far as ancestry is concerned, Roman Italy is definetly part of our heritage just like Roman Austria for example, sure. What is most important to note however is that this mixture of invaders (romans) and natives (dacians), resulting in the birth of our people, took place here, in Romania, during ancient times. Not in Italy or anywhere else. ",

The Romanian homeland will always be Romania itself. However, due to cultural, linguistic and historical ties with Italy, we do hold Italy up to a higher standard than other countries. After all, we call ourselves Romanians (a derivative of the Romans), and this etymology ultimately stems from the city of Rome, which happens to be in Italy. So we do think of Italy as a sister nation, even though this sentiment may not be reciprocated by Italians. Notice I said sister nation, not parent nation; this distinction is key because this idealized link to Italy is imbedded in Roman history not Italian history. So Romanians and Italians share more or less a common history through the Roman Empire, but most Romanians do not believe that one country historically supersedes the other. ",

The French consider themselves more the descendants of the Gauls, the Bulgarians the descendants of the Thracians, etc. And anyway Romanians do not make a direct connection between the Roman Empire and today's Italy.// When I teach the students, I explain to them that our ancestors are Dacians, Romans, and Slavs. And I show them that Romanians are now emigrating to Italy, the country where their ancestors came from 2000 years ago.

Following the 18th century Union between a part of the Orthodox Church from Transylvania (constituted mainly by Romanians) with the Catholic Church, there was an amazement of Romanians educated in Rome about the similarities between ancient Latin and the language they spoke. There was only a vague memory of the ancient Roman conquest, but the preservation of such an important cultural affinity in language was received in shock and generated many speculations and naive exaggerations. Among these exaggerations was also this history of Romanians that started with the foundation of Rome. So, to answer your question, at least for some time, at least for some people, Rome was nothing else than the origin of the Romanians. And, let\u2019s face it, no matter how aware we are today that this is a much simplifying myth, many of us are still going to Rome and stare at Emperor Trajan\u2019s column, where the conquest of Dacia is described.

Dacia, by the way, was left rather early, a lot before the grim 5. c. Yet the the colons who had arrived after the conquest managed how to keep alive their language (which was much more difficult as they were surrounded by german- and slavic-speaking peoples and hadnt akin neighbors as the Gauls and the Spanish). But anyway I guess they can feel connected to Rome rather than Italy: there\u2019s a difference. The word and an idea existed, but the nation was far to come.

Other than that, the Romanians are the descendants of the Romanized Dacians, just like the Spaniards and the Portuguese are the descendants of the Romanized Iberians and the French are the descendants of the Romanized Gauls. The territory of Romania was colonized mainly with \u201cRomans\u201d from Thracia, therefore DNA evidence shows the Romanians share a considerable number of common genetic ancestors with the Bulgarians from that period of time (2nd-5th century AD). The so-called molecular clock\u201d allows scientists to establish when two genetically related populations stopped intermarrying. In the case of Romanians and Bulgarians, that has happened at the beginning of the 6th century, when the Eastern Roman Empire lost control over Southern Romania because of the arrival of the Slavs. ",
