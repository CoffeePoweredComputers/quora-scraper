            "answer_text": "The British Team led by Robert Scott were the 2nd party to arrive at the south pole. They found the camp of Roald Amundsen there so knew immediately that they had lost the race to the south pole. Amundsen reached the pole on the 14th of December 1911 and there was enough time to get back home before the terrible Antarctic winter set in. But Scott and his team arrived too late on January 17th 1912, and all tragically died as temperatures plummeted and blizzards set in. ",
