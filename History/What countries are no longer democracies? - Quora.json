            "answer_text": "There are several countries in the world that once had free and fair elections but are now clear-cut authoritarian systems ruled by the people who had once electorally triumphed. I think the clearest example of a country that was democratic but is now authoritarian is Venezuela, where Hugo Chavez was actually elected in a free and fair election in 1999, but established an authoritarian revolutionary state with a cult of personality around the leader. However, political pluralism was never completely stamped out, hence parliament is against Maduro.  Turkey is another example too, although Turkey was never fully consolidated as a democracy. I do NOT consider Hungary to be authoritarian. Hungary should be considered an \u201cilliberal democracy.\u201d  Hungary has a multi-party system, it allows public protests, and Orban is actually very popular. His party Fidesz, won a huge victory in the last parliamentary election in 2018. Given that Hungary allows criticism of the government, it allows other parties to compete for power, and it has public support, I don\u2019t think it should be categorized in the same context as governments that monopolize the public space, aggressively clamp down on dissent, and aren\u2019t seen as legitimate by their own populations.  No, I\u2019m not Hungarian and have no interest in defending Orban. But to use the same word for Hungary that is used for Arab states, Cuba, China, Vietnam etc is nonsense. Hungary\u2019s political system is much freer. ",
