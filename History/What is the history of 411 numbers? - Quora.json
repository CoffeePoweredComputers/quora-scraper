            "answer_text": "In the US, \"411\" is the telephone number for directory assistance: 4-1-1. The linked Wiki page gives a decent history of the use of \"411\" in the US, which was used as the directory service number in New York and San Francisco by 1930. An alternate number for directory service is any phone number with a \"555\" prefix (555-1212, 555-xxxx - US local phone numbers always have seven digits), which is why phone numbers in Hollywood movies always start with 555.

            "answer_text": "The only 411 number that means anything to me is the name of the Volkswagen 411 of 1968 through 1972:   The 4 in the \"411\" indicates that it is the 4th VW car design that made it into a model (after the Beetle, the Transporter, and the 1500 Sedan). I don't know how the 11 came about - the successor model was a slight modification called \"412\". ",
