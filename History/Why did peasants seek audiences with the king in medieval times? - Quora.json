            "answer_text": "\u201cMedieval times\u201d covers a very long time from about 600AD to 1450AD, and the way in which kings ruled changed a lot in this period, mainly because kingdoms gradually increased in size as they decreased in number. King Aethelberht of Kent (590AD \u2013 C618AD) wrote the first codex in the English language. It is admirably concise and shows quite clearly that English law was compensatory rather than punitive. Much of it consists of compensation tables for various misdemeanours up to and including open killing. There are two very interesting features of this law. There is no mention of any noble class intermediate between the ceorl (at the top of peasant society) and the King himself. In particular, the ceorl has the highest wergild below the king (100 golden shillings). This does not mean that the king had no noble followers, but his comitatus appears to have been in constant attendance on the king and that they were rewarded in gold rather than land.There was a special penalty for breaking the peace \u201cwhen the king is drinking in a man\u2019s house\u201d.It should be noted that Anglo-Saxon kings as late as the 10th century spent most of their time travelling around their kingdoms and held court wherever they were. In a very small kingdom like Kent there were relatively few villages and towns, so the King\u2019s peregrinations might well be expected to cover every lathe and hundred at least once a year. So it might well be expected that the king might spend quite a lot of time \u201cdrinking (and eating) in men\u2019s houses\u201d. So there was ample opportunity for peasants to meet the king (and the members of his court) pretty frequently. In particular, if any law case had been too difficult for the local court to resolve the King might be asked to make a ruling, not by one but many peasants. This would be used to resolve future suits of the same nature. I suspect that most \u2018petitions\u2019 of this period were related to employment, especially for younger sons and daughters, and would have been addressed, not to the king himself, but to the appropriate official of the court.

            "answer_text": "Most audiences were sought for the redress of perceived wrongs or requests for assistance. The royal courts served as the \u201ccourt of appeals\u201d for decisions at manorial or baronial level.  In England, particularly after a royal absence overseas or after periods of civil unrest, kings would travel to the regions most effected. This was true of Edward I, Edward III, Richard II, and Edward IV, for example, all of whom made a particular point of participating in trials in places where there had been bouts of violence. As John Bellamy noted in his excellent work on Crime and Public Order in England in the Later Middle Ages (London: Routledge, 1973, 11): \u201cThe beneficial effect of the royal presence \u2026 at trials \u2026 was an acknowledged fact.\u201d In France, Louis IX of France took his role as \u201csupreme justice,\u201d to whom anyone could appeal to seek the amendment of a judgment, extremely seriously. He also sent out royal commissions to investigate complaints against royal officials. He introduced the concept of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d to the courts, and banned trial by ordeal.
