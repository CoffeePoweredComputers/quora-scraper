            "answer_text": "As the Baltic Republics lost their independence to the USSR in the WW2, there was quite some resistance among people. In the first years-decades, as a guerilla war, then as a hidden dissent. So the Moscow administration tried to pacify them, and this wasn\u2019t only about arresting guerillas (whoever is a guerilla for one side of a conflict, is a terrorist for the other side). Besides that, USSR encouraged cultural (not political) nationalism, gave certain social lifts and opportunities for political careers (with a membership of the Communist Party) and provided the Union Republics with higher standards of living. Yepp, Moscow pacified potentially unrestful Union Republics, redirecting cashflows from calm Russia and Belarus to those regions (the Baltics, Caucasus, Central Asia), where nationalistic sentiments were possible, thus making living standards there higher, than they would be without those extra money. As a side effect, it contributed to dissent of Russia\u2019s people, who saw Moscow promoting inequality, which was opposite to what socialism was supposed to be (\u201cStop feeding the Baltics at our expense! If they wanna go, let \u2018em!\u201d). I want neither confirm nor object Jonas\u2019 point about better work ethics. But as the USSR had command economy instead of market, the living standards depended much stronger on Moscow\u2019s decisions than on industriousness of a particular person. Finally, my relatives in Turkmenia could buy better goods than their counterparts in TASSR (in Russia) not because Turkmenia had Protestant or Catholic work ethics. ",

            "answer_text": "Why were the best living standards in the USSR in the Baltic states? Because the Baltic states joined the Soviet Union a generation later than the rest of the Soviet republics, and, in the official Soviet parlance, the remnants of capitalism were still present in the mindset of the populace. People with memories of normal life were still alive. Brainwashing lagged behind that of the rest of the country. For a visitor from Russia, the difference was obvious and looked amazing. Waitresses in cafes didn\u2019t scowl at customers but greeted them as if they were glad to see them. Pastries at pastry shops tasted like heaven. At a restaurant, strangers weren\u2019t forced to sit at the same table, which was 100% common in the rest of the country because it made the waiters\u2019 job easier. I wouldn\u2019t even mention work ethics because the three Baltic States were probably the last place in the whole country where those two words still had a meaning. ",
