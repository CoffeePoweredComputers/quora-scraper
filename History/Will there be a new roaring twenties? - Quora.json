            "answer_text": "Well, there are certainly possibilities for new eras of heady growth but whether they would have the same economic impact as that experienced during the roaring twenties is hard to say. While there are an array of technologies that could certainly deliver impressive growth in 21st century I am inclined to think that the growth probably would not be as impressive as that of the roaring twenties in the U.S mainly for two reasons: The U.S would already be starting from an already high base of economic development (the highest in the world) so achieving that kind of growth from this high base would be significantly more challenging than it was back then. Secondly the U.S would be competing with other nations in a more globalized world for that growth. It might be instructive to look at the drivers of growth during the roaring 20s. It was the large scale adoption of technologies like automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, aviation, electricity etc. What are 21st century equivalents of these? They are the ones that would be the most likely candidates that would deliver the new eras of heady growth that I referred to, should they materialize. A report by McKinsey on \u201cDisruptive Technologies\u201d discusses the widely agreed upon candidates. They are: Mobile Internet Automation of Knowledge work (largely through Machine Learning) The Internet of Things Cloud Technology Advanced Robotics Autonomous Vehicles Genomics Energy Storage 3D Printing Advanced Materials (through gains in nanotechnology) Advanced oil and gas exploration and recovery Renewable Energy The case of genomics is instructive. The genomics era got underway with the completion of the human genome project in 2003. The project cost U.S like $3 billion. That investment generated economic value to the tune of $796 billion and 310,000 jobs a mere 8 years later. Finally, economics hasn\u2019t developed the precision of a field like physics to make predictions on the level you seem to be demanding and probably never will. ",

            "answer_text": "In some regards, we are sort of experiencing those times now. ( I know it isn\u2019t a hundred years quite yet). Luxurious homes and mansions are being built everywhere. They may not have been like those in the \u2018Gilded Age\u2019, but they are still pretty nice.Fashion has a huge following as of now. The same could be said during those times.The economy, depending on whom you ask, is either doing well or not so well. Many people are prospering, and some are not.Prohibition is obviously been by the wayside for one hundred years, but the government has continued to take some sort of action in regards to the alcohol industry.The economies for both periods have exited a wartime economy.The economies for both of these periods are also perilously fragile.Technology has been widely celebrated, as it was back then. The number of cars bought then was tripled. Vehicle ownership varies, but trucks have been in demand due to lower gas prices. (That was opposite a few short years ago).Both periods draw considerable parallels to the attention to the stock market. There are infatuations that were experienced by both periods. It was a relatively new thing in those days, not so much now. But the promise of richness still draw many to Wall Street.Credit\u2026well, let\u2019s not get too much into it. It\u2019s an evil thing, unless you know how to take care of it.The big thing that do not draw comparisons are human rights. African Americans had very little in the way of rights. Women weren\u2019t held to the highest of esteem, as well as immigrants. If you weren\u2019t a white male, you had a hard time finding a place in the world then. How Do 1920s And Today Compare? ",
