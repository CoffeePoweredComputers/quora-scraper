Common in East Asian cultural heritage societies.RogueScrews the people.This is how it typically plays out: Sam Qwato's answer to What is the historical process through which a democracy takes in becoming a dictatorship?(3) East Asian Confucian heritage values An orderly society (as opposed to 24X7 healthy tension).Respect for authority (as opposed to trust nobody, anyone who can be corrupt/rogue will be).Primacy of education (as opposed to education being just one realm in life, notwithstanding it is an important realm).Education feeding into meritocracy and technocracy. (As opposed to education / knowledge / skills / capability is just one dimension of political leaders, amongst many.)Duties/obligations of dad/children range up symmetrically to ruler/subjects (as opposed to family and political realms are totally different realms).Moderation, continuumShame-based morality. If you fcuk up, you shame yourself, your family, your family pet poodle, your clan, your family name for generations and eons to come. Better you commit suicide honorably to discharge your family. Respect authority, and on the flipside, the authority has a high price to pay if he turns bad. (As opposed to guilt-based. Wrongdoing. Caught out. Guilty as charged. Punished. Reset. Forget. Reboot. Reinvent. Rebrand. Born again. Only impacts the individual, not the family. Shit conveniently washes off in a single wash cycle.)",
