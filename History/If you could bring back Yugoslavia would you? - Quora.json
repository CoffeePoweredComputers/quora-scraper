            "answer_text": "Yes, I would do it right this moment if I could. First of all, let me be clear, (SFR) Yugoslavia that existed in period 1945\u20131992 couldn\u2019t exist in that form today. That country was wonderful, while it was politically, economically and military strong, the spirit of that country was set right and that was a huge deal. That region of Balkans was in wars for centuries, in a very small geographical space there was a mix of many different ethnic groups, different cultures and three different major religions (Orthodox, Catholic and Islam). This made all these wars in the past more fierce and there was so much hatred along ethnic and religion lines. Yugoslavia was able to unite people from different parts of the spectrum. People of Yugoslavia had such a different origins but still spirit that they grew up with thought them that they are all \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d and that we\u2019re all one people, no matter of our past differences. And it worked, as years were passing notion of one nation in Yugoslavia was becoming stronger (something similar to American nation that will adopt you no matter of your origins). With all that said, Yugoslavia back then was a country that offered really decent life to its citizens, much better than what today\u2019s countries in the region can offer and much better than most countries in the world can offer today. Some details what we had in Yugoslavia you can find in beautiful answer by Sandra Hegedu\u0161 Toni\u0107. Now, back to reality. That country couldn\u2019t exist today. Simply, world has changed in last 30 years and socialist country such as Yugoslavia with such a political and social system couldn\u2019t (successfully) exist today. So Yugoslavia would have to reform to catch up with rest of the world. Democracy and capitalism would have to be adopted at some point. However, idea behind Yugoslavia was a righteous and smart one. From the beginning of the history, we saw that when people unite they become stronger. That was true for first hordes and tribes, for first countries in Mesopotamia and Egypt, that was true for United States (imagine how strong they would be if they are 50 independent countries today) and it is true for European Union (though EU is very young and has some early phase problems today, future will prove that unification is right path for Europe). Same is true for Yugoslavia, idea behind it was brilliant, to unite people that live in the same region and have so much similarities, to one country and it was done right, as I said, spirit was most important thing, it takes time to develop it and people started to embrace it more and more as the time passed. Only thing that was left is to reform country for modern times that has never happened due to the wars of 90\u2032s. Finally, let me speculate a bit what would happen if wars haven\u2019t started in 1991. Today European Union consists of 28 states, 9 out of them belonged to Eastern European Bloc controlled by USSR. In 1990 Yugoslavia was decades ahead of these countries in almost every important area: economically stable and independent, politically strong (obviously with internal problems but strong political player in the world), with strong ties with western world, with educated population that was influenced by western culture much more than any country of Eastern Bloc and finally least socialist country among all socialist countries (private sector was already developed to some degree). As such, Yugoslavia was much stronger candidate to become EU member than any of other 9 countries. Most of these 9 countries started their membership negotiations in 1996 and earliest ones were admitted in 2004. If Yugoslavia didn\u2019t break up, we would become candidate and EU member far before these countries, I don\u2019t have any doubt about that. My belief is that we would become member before 2000. EU was young at a time and with fall of communism they were eager to show that they are open for ex-socialist countries as well. And who is better to be first candidate if not a country that already has infrastructure, strong economy (so they don\u2019t have to pour money to help) and that has strong ties with western world? Yugoslavia was ready before many, we had to reform political system, adjust laws and do other smaller corrections but we were miles ahead of other countries that are EU members today. And we managed to screw this up completely. This should go to history books and hopefully new generations should learn something from this lesson. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I would.Reasons:1. Stable economy with low unemployment rates;2. A market which produced its own products;3. There were giant industries;4. The political system worked to serve people, not the other way around;5. All borders were open; You could travel mostly without visa;6. No one was leaving Yugoslavia to seek better job elsewhere;7. The terms \"decency\" and \"honesty\" were used in our daily dictonaries.8. As as a person who has Croatian origin, no one would care that I married someone who is Serbian;9. There would be lower debt (when you sum up all debts from former yugoslav republics you get 10x times the debt which Yugoslavia had);10. We had scientists, not opportunists;11. If you went to University there was a slight chance you would be unemployed for some time; Now only in my country there is more than 35% unenployment rate;12. People would be educated in basics of economics; They would have basic understanding of markets, interests, loans etc. This would allow them better life opportunities. I could go on...To sum up, Yes I would go back. It seams now that my grandparents who fought in World War II, and their whole generation suffered and was killed for some profiters and opportunists.
