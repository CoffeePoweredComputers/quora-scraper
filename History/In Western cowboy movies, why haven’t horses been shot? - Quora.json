            "answer_text": "In the old, old westerns they were or fell while running. This was done by attaching wires to one or more legs then yanking the wires when they wanted the horse to go down. Obviously, a horse galloping at 20 mph. is going to sustain damage from this. The animal protection people stepped in and managed to put an end to this practice. Now moviemakers need to rent a specially trained stunt horse is to film falls. It's cheaper to shoot the rider and miss the horse. ",

Not only were horses shot, stepped in prairie dog holes, went over gullies, river banks, pulled down by wild cattle, ate the wrong grass, too much water, failed to be rubbed down/cooled off. BAD WATER, wolves, cats, bears, folks needing supper\u2026 ",
