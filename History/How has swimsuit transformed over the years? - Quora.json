            "answer_text": "Unfortunately for guys there is no change. Guys wear the same outfit since the early on and that is those board shorts and swimming in those shorts is not possible. Next for women the changes has been going on since the introduction of the famous Bikini. I am Dutch by birth and while living in Holland I wore bikini and I still do only I get those looks as if I wear something illegal. At one point I wore a U A black underwear and I only wear them for swimming as she gave me support while swimming. Because it was a bikini so the guard asked me if that was a swim suite. I told her that is what we wear in Holland, we swim, we don't stand still along the swimming pool wall. And she went on trying to tell me that my bulge was visible. How absolutely stupid. The mentality is here in the west still redneck country. So I prefer bikini and I don't have a belly or I would not wear one. While I write this I am sitting in a \"Skort\" and a string strap tank top. How cool is that. And the world is still round. I absolutely don't care if a guy sees my bulge. ",

This type of swimwear had been the norm from the beginning of the 20th century.  Photo: Boston Gasworks swimming club - about 100 years ago. Nowadays, in the first quarter of the 21st century, when I go swimming I wear much briefer swimwear as do most men. Some favour shorts while I like briefs, but it seems to me there has been a significant change over the years.  Photo: 12th May 2019 - Me swimming in the pool at the Mythos Hotel, Tingaki, Kos, Greece. Am wearing my Kiniki Bluestone tanthru swim briefs. ",

            "answer_text": "Most transformations have been in materials & the coverage (or lack thereof). A couple of the trends I have observed with women's suits - some so-called bikinis have higher-waisted bottoms, & there are both one-piecers & two-piecers with little or no coverage over the backside. I like the lower-cut bikinis best. I have my navel pierced, & high-waisted suits rub on my piercing in ways that I don't care for. Oh, let me share a joke from when I was little! An elderly couple went to the beach for the first time in many many years. \"Oh dear!\" the woman said. \"I need to get a new swimsuit!\" \"What's wrong?\" her husband asked. \"Mine has a big hole in the knee!\" ",

            "answer_text": "Fashion has changed significantly since the Victorian Era, but perhaps no garment has gone through a more dramatic transformation than the swimsuit. In just over 100 years, the swimsuit has gone from long, billowing gowns to barely-there bikinis that leave little to the imagination. This drastic change is of course due to shifting mindsets about women\u2019s rights and political freedoms. From modest to micro-mini, here is an in-depth look of history of swimwear throughout the decades.  ",

Don't get me wrong this isn't a negative thing as those who are comfortable shouldn't feel ashamed, though i wish people would also understand body positivity doesn't always mean baring all, it can just mean you feel comfortable in your own skin, and full coverage clothes as much as revealing ones :) ",

They were made of thick outside nylon and the inside ling was all cotton. They did cover up a lot of a a man\u2019s anatomy, yet felt nice wearing them, but took some time trying to strip it off and having a an erection in them when wet. A woman\u2019s one piece swimsuit was about the same but with spandex material in them and fit her quite tightly. She liked wearing it, but like a man\u2019s swim briefs of an earlier time period, would take some time and doing trying to strip it off. Today\u2019s swimsuits for both men and women are briefer, lighter and feel much better wearing them while swimming. ",
