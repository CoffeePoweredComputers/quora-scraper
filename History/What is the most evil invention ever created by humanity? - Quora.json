            "answer_text": "A lot of them. In fact, most of them aren\u2019t even tangible. I\u2019ll put a nice list to express my view... in my own definition of \u201cevil\u201d. I didn\u2019t intend to offend anyone, but really, evil pays better, and guess who\u2019s the most evil guy in your room? Tribalism : Funnily enough, the most evil thing humans had ever invented was made back when humans haven\u2019t even discovered fire yet, and already it is the very evil that kept our whole human race alive all along. But when civilizations started to meet each other, soon enough they think they\u2019re the master race just because they can cross the sea before anyone else figured it out. You know the rest, as slavery and racial divide become rampant in the name of white men\u2019s burden and other such nonsense. The sheer scale of the racial superiority humans can express makes Adolf Hitler looks like a saint in comparison to the whole world put together.Communism : A stupid and unrealizable dream, at least not realizable in our mortal realm, that\u2019s what it is. Because someone must be at the top of the whole system, when they goes corrupt, as power does that to almost anyone, the nation that practices that goes nowhere but down. China is about the only nation that claimed to be Communist that is not evil\u2026 in the sense of actually care about their citizens\u2019s wealth, but that\u2019s not saying much, cuz we all know China and USA are \u201cevil\u201d. It\u2019s kinda necessary if you wanna be big. Being evil, that is.Democracy : Democracy coincides with the interest of more people, but it is a double edged sword that Socrates quickly catch up on its consequences, but somehow Americans have decided that it\u2019s the best thing ever despite its increasingly visible flaws in its implementation, if only in order to maintain a sensible-looking mask of pro-citizens government to avoid a French Revolution. I mean, we got more prosperous nation and more informed people, but that haven\u2019t stopped people from trying to subvert it. We got miracles from democracy sometimes, but without evil, where would democracy go? A childish dream at the same yet different league with communism, that\u2019s what. And where did America go with it? Plutocracy. Apparently the rich has more voice than millions of citizens combined and should stay rich forever like a modern feudal system. Oops.Copyright: Apparently entertainment is such a fickle thing that it needed patents all on its own. The gentleman in the last century are so concerned about their paycheck that they invited some dollar-eyed mafias to publish things for them. Come a century later and these same mafias says that downloading free media that they arbitrarily copyrighted are the same as downloading communism, but really, communism from the Internet is less evil than the media mafias limiting our experience.Gunpowder : Originally made by accident in pursuit for a potion of immortality. Then Mongols traded that away to bloodthirsty Europeans who live in a kill-or-be-killed game of thrones world, who proceeded to merrily built the boomstick they used to shoot anything they don\u2019t like to extinction. They also accidentally bred the biological weapons that killed off most of the native Americans too, but nobody at that time knew about this.Fiat Currency : Sly way to make the world go round in your palms, it seems. We fixed US dollar to gold, but then took that pesky gold standard away and printed absurd amount of money to buy some damned pointless stuff. And a good portion of it was embezzled by immoral rich devils.And now for something totally physical: Project Pluto. That is all.Project Pluto - WikipediaTake a nuclear bomber and strap a nuclear ramjet on it and lo, behold, the child of Legion of The Death Star to behold, death offerings for the Rulers of the Underworld, built under the trust in the Lord (or Jewish Science?). I dunno what mad science of logic or mysteries that led the land of the free to concoct this death-ridden craft straight from the corpse of a death-ridden black hole that was once a blinding superstar, brighter than any stars we could ever produce in any sense of word. But one thing is certain: once it took flight, it would herald the Apocalypse as it flies as an unstoppable phoenix of death and destruction\u2026 But at least this thing never existed, unlike hundreds of peacekeeping ICBMs that will kill us all if anyone pressed it.",

            "answer_text": "The hand gun. Humans are separated from other species in the animal kingdom, largely by our ability to make tools. Tools can be thought of as any device that provides utility for fulfilling a human desire or need. The invention of gun powder gave rise to the rifle: a tool of significant utility. Humans cannot compete in combat with other apex predators absent tools to gain advantage. Spears, clubs, knives, snares, traps; all have been useful for humans in their confrontations with large, dangerous animals. Rifles proved the ultimate tool for hunting large prey and protection from apex predators. Before the invention of the rifle, packs of wolves, sometimes in numbers greater than thirty individuals, ruled the night, whereever the habitat spawned them. In 18th century Russia it was highly hazardous to venture out at night because large packs of wolves routinely tore humans apart enroute. The rifle allowed for the culling of large wolf packs and therefore mitigating the threat such packs posed to our safety. Rifles also proved useful for hunting large animals suitable for eating. But hand guns serve no such purpose.. Their sole utility is to kill other human beings in close combat. They are much less accurate at the distances often required to hunt large prey. Hand guns are , as I call them, Human Being Killing Machines. They automate the dispensing of another human being, and thats about all they are good for. While it unfortunately, on occasion, becomes necessary to forge into battle, war is, more often than not a gross misuse of manpower and resources. Most wars end with the parties involved finally sitting down together to work out the terms under which they will coexist peacefully in the future. In other words: the warring nations eventually resolve to coexist peacefully, deciding upon terms agreeable to all parties, so, since diplomacy always provides the solution to the problems nations confront, why not cut to the chase and use diplomats to settle disputes in all cases? But I digress somewhat. My point is that it is rifles, not handguns, that play the dominant role in modern warfare. Side arms are carried into battle and are useful in policing nations too. But in every instance the hand guns utility is reduced to that of a Human Being Killling Machine. And in my opinion, killing other human beings is something mankind is better off not participating in. We need to rely upon our reasoning skills to resolve disputes that arise amongst our people's..We are after all, all one big family. At the end of the day we share in common the title: Earthlings. And it is my view that we should do all we can to avoid killing one another. It is an occasional necessary evil, But ultimately it remains an evil. ",
