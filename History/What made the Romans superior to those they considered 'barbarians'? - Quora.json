            "answer_text": "I could answer civilisation, technology, their monuments and architecture, but I would be remiss in doing so to ignore the source of the wealth which funded those things. So I will say two things: 1 - victory and conquest 2 - the Romanisation of other countries. Others wanted to be like them. For a long time even the Greeks referred to themselves as Romanoi. These reasons are not separate, but both were the proof to Roman eyes that they were superior. Both are the proof to American and Western eyes today that they are superior. Military strength, wealth, and the emulation of culture. Where the modern answer might be wealth, without which strong militaries are impossible, for Rome I would answer tactics, discipline, and adaptability. They were able to synthesise weapons and fighting styles from many cultures. This is what made them superior. I will also add that a common aspect of Roman culture, which I forget the word for, was that there came moments in public life where you risked it all. Call it luck, call it wisdom, but victory or oblivion hinged upon the outcome. They were used to the idea of everything or nothing. This perhaps is what made the Romans so difficult to defeat. There were many times in the forging of their empire where they seemed defeated but refused to give up or even discuss terms. They just kept going and spawning new armies until the tide turned in their favour. Victory or oblivion, everything or nothing. Many would have sued for terms with Hannibal roaming the country, but the Romans kept going until it was Carthage that was obliterated. ",

            "answer_text": "The Romans had a a fairly clear idea abiut why they were superior. They saw barbarians as: Irrational and inconsistent,.prone to hurried and contradictory decisions. Subject to their rulers arbitrary power. They saw themselves as having valuable rights such as the right to give evidence in court, the right to have the courts back them up, to not be detained unfairly. We would see this as contradicted by the tyrannical power of the emperor, but the Romans believed they still had a republican constitution. The Romans believed that militarily the barbarians came on in a rush and fought hard for a while, whereas Roman troops were consistent fighters who would beat the barbarians as they tired. This was because Romans were better armed and armoured, better trained and fitter than the barbarians. Romans could operate siege machines and built camps every night on campaign. Again this was a result of tge Romans greater rationality. Barbarians wore leather and furs, Romans wore more elegant and civilised clothing. The formal toga was something you could not run around in, you had to move in a dignified manner. If the Romans saw something in a neighbouring country tgat was better tgan what tgey had then they happily adopted it. If Celtic trousers were better in the winter, if British raincoats or Parthian horse armour or Spanish swords were better than what they had then Rome borrowed it. ",
