            "answer_text": "Was there ever a time there was a black and white TV where you lived? I was born in the mid 1950\u2019s, so I pretty much cut my teeth watching B&W TV. My father was just as much a gadget junkie as I am, so after color television started making its inroads into popular culture, he wanted to feel like he was keeping up with the trend so he bought one of these:  That\u2019s a sheet of transparent plastic with bands of blue, pink and green coloring that was meant to be stuck to the front of a B&W television set. And yes, it was well into the 80\u2019s before people finally dropped the word \u201cset\u201d when talking about television, so this silliness was definitely an accessory to a television set. I watched my first episodes of Star Trek through one of these sheets. The idea was that in a great many scenes in television programs, the composition was such that the top third held sky, the bottom third showed grass and the middle was where the people - almost exclusively Caucasian - were seen. So blue, pink and green. Almost like a real color television set. Color adjacent, I guess. Once my dad\u2019s income rose and the price of color TVs came down, we eventually got to see what we were missing, usually with colors only slightly improved over the plastic sheet\u2019s version. And long after color television was considered to be the standard across America a new fad hit where many bedrooms ended up with a secondary television set, usually B&W. That\u2019s because color television sets tended to be large free standing consoles and bulky. So the bedroom models had to be small and inexpensive. ",

            "answer_text": "Until I was almost 11 years old, there was nothing BUT black and white TV where I lived. Color TV went on sale in 1954, one year before I was born. The first color TV set sold for $1,000, which is equivalent to about $9,400 today. There was very little color programming and just about all of it was on NBC. At that time, NBC was owned by RCA. RCA was a giant electronics company and it had invented the color TV system (NTSC) approved by the FCC. At this time, the system was still not quite perfected. Neither color saturation nor color hue were very stable and they shifted frequently in the course of a single half hour show. For these reasons (expense, lack of extensive programming, and poor quality) very few color TV's were sold at all in the U.S. for the first 10 years. But RCA and other companies worked out the problems. The picture became consistently good by 1964. All of the networks and most local stations were broadcasting several hours daily in color. By 1966, the price of a color TV had dropped to about $400. It was still expensive (about $3,000 in 2019 dollars, but the price would continue to drop and soon a color TV would be the same cost that black and white TV's had been in the late 1940\u2032s and early 1950\u2032s in the early days of TV when it first became extremely popular. I was the oldest child in my family. My three younger sisters don't recall that Saturday in January of 1966 when our first color TV was delivered and set up in our den. The black and white TV that had been in that room since 1962 was put in my bedroom. Over the next few years, all the remaining black and white TVs were replaced with color sets. ",
