            "answer_text": "\u201cBetter\u201d becomes a vague word when you want to compare China\u2019s and Russia\u2019s armed forces. The question is how would you compare them. Before we come into any detailed comparison, we may need to take a look at the mission/purpose of the two countries\u2019 military. Russia\u2019s military today mainly focuses on the ability to effectively intervene and protect Russia\u2019s security interests in the peripheral (basically Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Middle East), while maintaining a formidable nuclear deterrence against the US so that to ensure its national sovereignty. Many people don\u2019t realize that the size of the Russian armed forces today is even smaller than that of South Korea\u2019s. It NO LONGER serves the purpose of sweeping over the Europe like the Soviet did 30 years ago. Anyone who is interested in Russian military today should be familiar with Serdyukov\u2019s reform. In the first decade of the 21st century, Russia\u2019s armed forces mostly completed its transform from a world-war military into a regional intervention army. This reform is successful as it accepts the fact that Russia\u2019s economy is no longer capable to support a Soviet-era size military while utilizes new technologies and doctrines to ensure military effectiveness in small-scale regional intervention. I guess Russia\u2019s success in Georgia (2008), Donbass (2014 onward) and Syria (2015 onward) is a good proof of its military\u2019s effectiveness in small-scale, low-intensity warfare (around its border). Of course, Russia is still the single most effective nuclear power compared to the US. Despite the shrinking defense budget, it continues to spend heavily on modernizing its ICBMs, SSBNs and even bomber fleet. That perhaps is the most cost-effective method to prevent a full-scale war against NATO (or the US if you prefer). China, on the other hand, is preparing for something else. Unlike Russia which has already finished its military reform, China\u2019s military reform is underway. The People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) does not suffer the budget shrink like its counterpart in Russia, but receiving increasingly larger amount of investment. That means it does not need to sacrifice its capability to fight a full-scale war. One similar thing is that the PLA is also transforming from the old cold-war era structure into something new. But what it differs from Russian military is that the PLA targets to fight a medium-scale high-intensity war around its border. China understands that any potential conflicts it might fight in the peripheral would involve the US. Therefore, its\u2019 military reform targets to fight a conventional war with the US in scenarios like Korean Peninsula or Taiwan. That\u2019s why we see China invests a lot on 5th generation fighter (J-20), digital combined infantry brigade (similar to the BCT of the US), and naval surface fleet with destroyers capable of area air defense. China keeps a minimum strategic deterrence and a non-first strike doctrine. In this aspect, its nuclear power is far behind Russia. In a nutshell, Russia is preparing for a war without US being its enemy while China is preparing for a war with US involved. Whose military is better depends heavily on the war scenario you proposed.

            "answer_text": "To be honest, the Russian military is more powerful than China. How, based on military experience. Russia\u2019s military though less in number, is powerful in experience, combat readiness and morale. Russia is just like the US, UK, France, Germany, and the other countries involved in the Global War on Terror. They\u2019ve been involved in wars and their armies have been tested and have combat experience to fight. China hasn\u2019t experience modern combat in decades, and imagine their own military experiences in the past. In the Korean War they sent peasants with no formal training or combat experience to fight which ended up in disaster. One major point is that China\u2019s economy is slowing down and it would be a TOTAL ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DISASTER if China went to war with any other country because of the economic consequences it may have. Second, the People\u2019s Liberation Army is solely a political institution to keep the Communist Party in power, not solely dedicated to defending China as a country. Third, China still relies on Russia for reverse-engineering, simply put COPYING RUSSIAN MILITARY HARDWARE and FOR SUPPLYING ENGINES FOR THEIR FIGHTER JETS, WHICH ARE ALSO RUSSIAN OR WESTERN COPIES. The majority of China\u2019s fighter jets are almost exact copies of their Russian and Western counterparts and one thing that also keeps their aerial assets cut short in superiority over their counterparts, is that China has not mastered building their own fighter jet engines, and Russia has to supply it for them. Most of China\u2019s weapons are seen as copycats of other weapons. The most obvious would be their fighter jets, J-11, J-15, J-16 the J-20 and the J-31, all taken from the Russian Sukhoi Su-27, the Sukhoi Su-33, the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning powered by RUSSIAN MADE ENGINES. I think China could be a great naval power because of the rapid progression of their surface warships but for aircraft carrier technology and experience, they would lag behind the United States. I would definitely say that if a hypothetical war between Russia and China did flare up, I\u2019d bet Russia can outmatch China anytime and fairly quickly since they have the most modern combat experience, their forces are well-trained and battle-hardened in the wars they\u2019ve been involved in, and for sure the Russians already know how China\u2019s military technology works, because it came from them and China reverse-engineered them!
