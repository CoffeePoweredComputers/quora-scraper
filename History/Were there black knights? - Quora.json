            "answer_text": "Moors invasion of Spain In 711, the bold Tarik crossed the straits and disembarked near a rock promontory, which from that day since has borne his name \u2014 Djabal Tarik (\u201cTarik\u2019s Mountain\u201d), or Gibraltar. In August 711, Tarik won paramount victory over the opposing European army. On the eve of the battle, Tarik is alleged to have roused his troops with the following words: \u201cMy brethren, the enemy is before you, the sea is behind; whither would ye fly? Follow your general; I am resolved either to lose my life or to trample on the prostrate king of the Romans.\u201d Wasting no time to relish his victory, Tarik pushed on with his dashing and seemingly tireless Moorish cavalry to the Spanish city of Toledo. Within a month\u2019s time, General Tarik ibn Ziyad had effectively terminated European dominance of the Iberian Peninsula. This Is a whole army of mounted Knights, in European terms. The Black Saint Maurice: Knight of the Holy Lance Of all the many Black men in the history of Europe, few have excited the imagination more than Saint Maurice. He was a Black saint in an area then and now that has very few Black inhabitants. He was also a Black knight. Indeed, we could call him a knight in shining armor. He is no less than remarkable. The name Maurice is derived from Latin and means \u201clike a Moor.\u201d The Black Saint Maurice (the Knight of the Holy Lance) is regarded as the great patron saint of the Holy Roman Germanic Empire. He is also known, especially in Germany, as Saint Mauritius. The earliest version of the Maurice story and the account upon which all later versions are based, is found in the writings of Bishop Euchenus of Lyons, who lived more than 1500 years ago. According to Eucherius, Saint Maurice was a high official in the Thebaid region of Southern Egypt \u2014 a very early center of Christianity. Specifically, Maurice was the commander of a Roman legion of Christian soldiers stationed in Africa. By the decree of Roman emperor Maximian, his contingent of 6,600 men was dispatched to Gaul and ordered to suppress a Christian uprising there. Maurice disobeyed the order. Subsequently, he and almost all of his troops were martyred when they chose to die rather than persecute Christians, renounce their faith and sacrifice to the gods of the Romans. The execution of the Theban Legion occurred in Switzerland near Aganaum (which later became Saint Maurice-en-Valais) on Sept. 22, either in the year 280 or 300. In 962, Otto I chose Maurice as the title patron of the archbishopric of Magdeburg, Germany. By 1000 C.E. the worship of Maurice was only rivaled by St. George and St. Michael. After the second half of the 12th century, the emperors were appointed by the pope in front of the altar of St. Maurice, in St. Peter\u2019s Cathedral in Rome. Initially in the adventure, Morien is simply called \u201cthe Moor.\u201d He first challenges, then battles, and finally wins the unqualified respect admiration of Sir Lancelot. In addition, Morien is extremely forthright and articulate. Sir Gawain, whose life was saved on the battlefield by Sir Morien, is stated to have \u201charkened, and smiled at the black knight\u2019s speech.Sir Morien and the Black presence in Medieval Europe (or the real Black Knight) Lets not forget the Nobility that made Knights!

            "answer_text": "Funny you should mention that: I\u2019m sure you herd of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the round Table:  Well what if i told you that despite popular belief that it is depicted in the vast majority of the stories and Legends that a \u201cbrown\u201d gentleman stood in Arthur's court as one of his best and brightest\u2026 \u2026possibly THE best and brightest, The Knight known as Lancalot!  Yep the \u2018Once upon a time\u2019 depiction of Sir Lancalot is mythologicaly accurate! as described in the legend: \u201cHis shield and his armour were even those of a Moor, and black as a raven\u2026 Had they not heard him call upon God no man had dared face him, deeming that he was the devil or one of his fellows out of hell, for that his steed was so great, and he was taller even than Sir Lancelot, and black withal, as I said afore\u2026\u201d  Now to be fair a \u201cMoor\u201d in old English usage, describes a Moroccan or, formerly, a member of the Muslim population of what is now Spain and Portugal. Of mixed Arab, Spanish, and Amazigh (Berber) origins, the Moors created the Arab Andalusian civilization and subsequently settled as refugees in North Africa between the 11th and 17th centuries but universally depicts a Moor as being of dark skinned individual and not of England herself. Weirdly there is a literal \u201cblack knight\u201d described in the legend Sir Elgar\u2026who was white\u2026and Irish while Lancalots armour was described as Black Silver and Gold resplendent in white tabbard while under service to Arthur's court making him stand out. and dont get me started on the bloody Green Knight! Its almost like the legend was written to be confusing. ",
