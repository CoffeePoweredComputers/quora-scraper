As for myself, I\u2019m a little young (born 5 years after he died), but in 1994 I bought a used Cadillac Eldorado in California from a German gentleman who was half Jewish and was proud of the fact that in 1943 when he was a boy he shook hands with Hitler, and managed to get through the war without being found out and sent to a camp. He wrote a book about Hitler, called \u201cHitler\u2019s Secret\u201d as I recall, but over the years I\u2019ve lost it and I doubt it\u2019s still in print. ",
