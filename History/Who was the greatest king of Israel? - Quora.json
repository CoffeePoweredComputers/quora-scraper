            "answer_text": "King David was the greatest king of Yehuda and Israel, since his monarchy united the entire tribes as one nation. He also authored many of the psalms in the Book of Psalms, although some were written by others and included in his edited version. His unique spiritual viewpoint and his personal sufferings are what have inspired generations of Jews throughout our history, until the present generation in the path of faith of God, and his teachings show us the path of prayer and how to conquer our own selfish natures. Although his son Solomon was brilliant, he became proud and bungled the early accomplishments that were made on the shoulders of his father, and his transgressions of biblical laws for kings brought about the splitting of the kingdom after his death. Too many wives, too many horses, and too much gold were collected by him. Whatever buildings that Omri and his son may have created, we are indeed now uncovering the palace of David in the city of Jerusalem, since much was destroyed in subsequent wars. So David will be restored, in spite of the naysayers among some secular, modern Israeli archeologists. ",
