            "answer_text": "The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 did not make the healthcare industry \"for profit.\" What it did was encourage the formation of HMOs, and there was a sharp increase in for-profit HMOs after that time. Kaiser, the largest, remained a not-for-profit organization and still is today. The industry as a whole was not entirely for profit or not for profit before or after 1973. Blue Cross was historically not-for-profit, but Aetna, a for-profit company, had been selling major medical insurance policies since the 1950s. Most insurers are operated for profit today.Most hospitals were (and are) not for profit, but HCA was founded as a for-profit hospital company in the 1960s, and others followed.Most physician offices weren't and still are not charitable enterprises.Pharmaceutical and medical device companies were and are for-profit companies.The question probably stems from a post circulated on Facebook in early 2019, claiming that \"before 1973, it was illegal in the US to profit off health care.\" That claim has been firmly debunked by both Snopes and Politifact. Politifact: Post wrongly says profiting off health care was illegal Snopes: Was It Illegal to Profit from Healthcare Prior to the HMO Act of 1973? ",
