Moreover, India has been one of the forerunners in the global sesame market. And the market of sesame seeds is likely to grow for the forecasted period of 2018-2024, with Europe growing as the newly rising market. The growth of sesame seeds import in Europe is noteworthy, with the import rate increasing 3% annually. The rise in import was triggered by challenges faced by European suppliers in producing adequate sesame seeds. In 2016, imports of sesame seeds in Europe have grown to approximately 155 thousand tonnes. From this market trend, we can induce that European countries would likely to increase sesame seed imports from India. India is also ranked 10 in exporting soya beans, with export value of $114.8M USD. They export their soya beans to Belgium, Germany, France, and Spain.
