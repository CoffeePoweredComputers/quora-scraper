            "answer_text": "The transatlantic slave trade was the largest forced migration in history, and undeniably one of the most inhumane. The extensive exodus of Africans spread to many areas of the world over a 400-year period and was unprecedented in the annals of recorded human history. As a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade, the greatest movement of Africans was to the Americas \u2014 with 96 per cent of the captives from the African coasts arriving on cramped slave ships at ports in South America and the Caribbean Islands. From 1501 to 1830, four Africans crossed the Atlantic for every one European, making the demographics of the Americas in that era more of an extension of the African diaspora than a European one. The legacy of this migration is still evident today, with large populations of people of African descent living throughout the Americas. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the transatlantic slave trade, initiated by the Portuguese in the western coast of Africa, in the beginning of the XVth century, which moved people from Africa to many parts of America can be considered as such. The other large slave trade was the one executed by people of the Arabian peninsula, just after the expansion of Islamism, in the eastern African coast, many centuries before the transatlantic trade. I do not think this trade was larger than the transatlantic. Another forced migration was done by the the Ottoman Empire and mostly enslaved and negotiated people of European origin. Well, I hope I have helped. Greetings. October 24, 2020. ",
