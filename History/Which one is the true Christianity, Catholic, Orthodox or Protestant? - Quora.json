            "answer_text": "Obviously as a Catholic you would expect me to answer \u201cCatholic\u201d to this question. But let\u2019s be careful. We can\u2019t say, \u201cwe have the Truth\u201d. It\u2019s more that the Truth has come to possess us all as Christians. Ultimately the Truth is a person, Jesus Christ, not simply a doctrinal system. In Christianity we find the deepest truths about God that God Himself has revealed to us, but that is by no means all the truth about God. What we do not know about God is far greater than that which we do know, as St John of the Cross would say in his apophatic way. Most parts of Protestantism contain a great deal of divine Truth, Orthodoxy contains even more of it, almost all that has been revealed. But where it comes to disagreements between the three, obviously I am going to say that I am Catholic because I believe the Catholic Church has the divine guarantee of inerrancy. It has synthesized Scripture, Tradition and the pronouncements of General Councils and Popes in a coherent and systematic way. That does not mean that every Catholic priest gets it right all the time, or even every Catholic bishop. Sometimes they go off message or get the wrong emphasis. And we have our black sheep and tares amidst the wheat. But in its solemn and defined teaching, I believe the Catholic Church has it correct. And we share so much of that with the Orthodox and with the majority of Protestants. ",

            "answer_text": "Catholic. But, really, why are you asking a question like this on a forum like this. A devout Catholic, like myself, will say Catholic. A devout member of Othodox Christianity, will say Orthodox Christianity, and will probably be particularly fervent in his or her defense of his or her particular rite. And a devout protestant will speak up for the Reformation, and probably be particularly vociferous in his or her defense of his or her particular denomination. Read the history for yourself. Investigate for yourself. Go to the various churches. Read the theology. Read the biographies of movers and shakers within the various branches. In particular, read accounts of, or talk to people who have, converted from protestantism or Orthodoxy to Catholicism, or vice versa, and find out what prompted them to make the change. But you won\u2019t find the answer you seek in a few hastily written paragraphs on a forum like this. ",
