            "answer_text": "From what I read.. Arjun married a widow, who was the daughter of King of Nagas. Aravan was born to them.Arjun(Mahabharath) Following are the lines from Mahabharata sacred texts, by KM Ganguli This handsome and valiant son of Arjuna, named Iravat, was begotten upon the daughter of the king of the Nagas by the intelligent Partha. Her husband having been slain by Garuda, she became helpless, and of cheerless soul. Childless as she was, she was bestowed (upon Arjuna) by the high-souled Airavat. Partha accepted her for wife, coming to him as she did under the influence of desire. It was thus that that son of Arjuna was begotten upon the wife of another. Abandoned by his wicked uncle from hatred of Partha, he grew up in the region of the Nagas, protected by his mother. And he was handsome and endued with great strength, possessed of diverse accomplishments, and of prowess incapable of being baffled. ",

            "answer_text": "The texts only prescribe a period of one year of mourning. After that women are free to do what they want. And there are plenty of evidences in our itihasa texts of widow remarriage. However, this frowning on widow remarriage (and the practices of Jauhar/Sati and Untouchability) crept into society in some regions in the period of Islamic rule from the 11th to the 17th centuries CE. The root cause is not clear, though it could have something to do with islamic rules on property rights (Islam: mahr) or the fact that in Islam marriage is considered a devotional act (Islam: ibadat). Of course, our Commies and our own ignorant folks who subscribe to southern Christian cults such as the Dravidian movement, love to bash the Hindu with their contention that widow remarriage is forbidden by prescription, without realizing that there are no prescriptions in Hindu texts, as these are not the \u201cBook of the Faithful\u201d.
