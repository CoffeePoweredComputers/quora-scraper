            "answer_text": "Absolutely, the other answers here saying they could not, seem to have a very low level understanding of what the Soviets actually did and what they send to Afghanistan. Let\u2019s have a look. The Soviet forces in Afghanistan was nominally commanded by the 40th Soviet army. Below you can see the structure of this army the time it entered the war.  The authorized strength being around 600,000 personnel. While only 115,000 were deployed to Afghanistan at the peak number, and for most of the war it was less than that. Notice that this army had 4 divisions. In 1981, the Soviet Union commanded over 200 active divisions of troops. Which means they had more than 50 groups like this. But even that is not entirely correct, as the 40th army was a central-Asian group of low priority. This meant that it was not as well equipped as Soviet European divisions. For example, the 40th Army was equipped with T-62 and T-55 tanks, while the Soviet units in Germany was equipped with T-72, T-64 or T-80 tanks. To put it simply, the Soviets could have brought literally millions of people into Afghanistan if they wanted to, and still had millions left to defend its western border. In fact they had more than 50 divisions in reserve in the central USSR they didn\u2019t bother moving. In reality the USSR used a fraction of a fraction of it\u2019s forces, to support the Afghan government. In comparison to the current war, the USSR had only 65,000 allied troops from the Afghan government at it\u2019s peek. While currently the US allied government has over 350,000 troops. The USSR was fighting an army of 200,000 plus Mujahedin supported by a superpower which was given state of the art weapons. While the US and it\u2019s allies have been fighting Taliban which number less than 70,000 currently, and is not receiving any real foreign support and is fighting with weapons which are over 30 years old. While we are at it, people also attribute a lot to the stinger missiles. But in reality, stinger is the absolute last line of air defense, and it\u2019s not that effective. In total the Soviets lost 222 aircraft in the entire period. Coalition forces in the current war has lost 168 aircraft. So the USSR only lost a few more aircraft to weapons from the 1980s in the 1980s, than the western coalition has lost to weapons from the 1980s, while fighting with equipment from 2000s+. Compare this to the fact that the US lost well over 5,000 aircraft in the Vietnam war, and it wasn\u2019t to stinger missiles. The Soviets could have done much more, but they did not want to. And a few stingers was not gonna stop them. Also the stinger was only introduced in 1987 and the vast majority of Soviet aircraft losses was before 1987, the introduction of the stinger had literally zero impact on the amount of aircraft destroyed per month for the Soviets.

            "answer_text": "Militarily they can continued occupation indefinitly, but politicly they can't Despite the \u201cstinger myth\u201d that always seems to pop up, about super effective manpads that turn the tide of the war. The Soviet was adapting and neither side was gaining any traction in eleminating each other. Morton Abramowitz, who directed the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the time, said in 1997: \"In 1985, there was a real concern that the [mujahideen] were losing, that they were sort of being diminished, falling apart. Losses were high and their impact on the Soviets was not great.\" Stingers certainly forced a shift in Soviet tactics. Helicopter crews switched their operations to night raids since the mujahideen had no night-vision equipment. Pilots made bombing runs at greater height, thereby diminishing the accuracy of the attacks, but the rate of Soviet and Afghan aircraft losses did not change significantly from what it was in the first six years of the war. Soviet decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was already made in October 1985, several months before Stinger missiles entered Afghanistan in significant quantities in the autumn of 1986. None of the secret Politburo discussions that have since been declassified even mentioned the Stingers or any other shift in mujahideen equipment as the reason for the policy change from indefinite occupation to preparations for retreat. The soviet dont commit much in afghanistan, neither they lost or win much. Compared to American commitment and losses in Vietnam, its only fraction of what Soviet experienced. However, the political side of spectrum was its imposible for the soviet to indeffinitly occupy afghanistan. Mikhael Gorbachev was promoting his policy of glasnost and perestroika. Which aim was restructure and reform the Soviet union. Also establish friendlier relatiin toward the west. On foreign affair side, Western countries put sanction upon soviet invasion of afghanistan. It was a hard blow for Gorbachev perestroika in international stage, on Domestic affair, There large dissent, confusion, shock and upon rulling class and people. A big question asked as Where soviet union were headed. Eventualy Gotbachev would face a coup that put Boris Yeltsin, in Power. Yeltsin was determined to cut back on the country's international commitments, and focus on reorganizing internaly. And the Soviet backed regime in kabul (which still fighting even after Soviet was out) would ultimately collapse after 1991, when Russia (as soviet was no more) stop sending fund, arms, bullet, fuel and anything else. \u2014\u2014 to make Soviet seriusly commit in afghanistan, Gorbachev and the soviet reform he bring would need to be erased from equation. That means the possibility of perpentual longer cold war as soviet union was not crumble in 1991. The afghan war often as many people mistakenly think was one of the nail that hammered upon Soviet union coffin, infact was a reverse. As it was not as major socio political event like vietnam to American (like antiwar movement, political scandal, and social crisis breed from its). But on afghan case. the Soviet reform under Gorbachev leadership made Soviet union unstable and volatile, not because war related result that force soviet to withdraw from afghanistan. If in vietnam, the anecdote might sound like \u201cGoverment cant wage war, without people support\u201d In afghan war its more like \u201cthere is no war, if you have no goverment\u201d ",
