            "answer_text": "Yes. Thomas Jefferson was eager to get rid of Aaron Burr, his first Vice President, and switched to George Clinton for the election of 1804. Andrew Jackson came to despise John Calhoun, his first Vice President, and dumped him for Martin van Buren in 1832. Abraham Lincoln replaced Hannibal Hamlin with Andrew Johnson in 1864. Ulysses Grant replaced Schuyler Colfax with Henry Wilson in 1872. In other cases the president switched to a different vice-presidential candidate because his first Vice President had died in office. James Madison, e.g., started off with George Clinton, but ran for a second term with Elbridge Gerry (after whom the gerrymander is named). Other presidents campaigned for re-election with a different vice-presidential running mate, but were defeated. Gerald Ford dumped Nelson Rockefeller in 1976 for Bob Dole, but lost to Jimmy Carter.
