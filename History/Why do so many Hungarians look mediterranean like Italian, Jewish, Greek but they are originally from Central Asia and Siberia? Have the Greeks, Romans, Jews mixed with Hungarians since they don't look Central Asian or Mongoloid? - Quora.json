            "answer_text": "Most modern Hungarians have at least some German ancestry, due to the fact that after the Habsburg conquest of Hungary from the Ottoman Empire at the end of the 17th century, large numbers of settlers were brought in from south-western Germany to repopulate the land from which the Muslim and Jewish inhabitants had withdrawn, leaving large parts of it almost desolate. The German immigrants settled mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the reconquered country, where they established agriculture and founded the first towns. During the 19th Century, the Hungarian ruling class pursued a policy of intense magyarisation, with the result that most of the German settlers adopted a Magyar ethnic identity, often changing their German names to Hungarian ones. It was a well-known fact that the Hungarian officer corps, one of the most fiercely nationalist groups in early 20th-Century Hungary, consisted oiverwhelmingly of descendants of German settlers. ",

            "answer_text": "The Hungarian ancient history is a relatively unknown field as the written evidence is scarce from that period (you know nomads don\u2019t really read or write). But it seems certain that the number of the invaders was relatively low and they mixed with the local population. So the population in the Carpat basin was not really Asian at the end of the 10th century to begin with. After that there was a lot of moving and mixing around, the latest major change is in the late 17th century when after the Turkish occupation huge territories were empty, as it is estimated that 2/3rd of the population perished during the 150 years. So the Habsburg emperors called settlers from the current Slovakia and Eastern part of Germany to Hungary. So quick and short it was a major mix for the last 1000 years. ",
