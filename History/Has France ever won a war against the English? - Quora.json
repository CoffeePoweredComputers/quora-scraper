            "answer_text": "Sort of, France was able to win the 100 years war against England, however, this was not so much one streight war as a series of conflicts that would occur off and on for about 100 years. This conflict was a dispute between whether the first cousin or nephew of Charles IV would rule France. The problem here was his nephew was already the King of England and this angered the French who wanted a French King and in addition to this tensions were already high between the two countries. This ultimately lead to England attacking France and a lot of English victories. The trend of English victories continued for quite some time but eventually France was able to push back England and win the war. Another example was the Norman conquest for England. \u201cNormandy was a duchy entrusted by the king of Francia to a Viking chief as a fief in exchange for homage, fealty and military service. It was part an integral part of the kingdom of Western Francia and in principle the king of Francia could take back the fief should the duke of Normandy not respect his obligations (doesn't mean he always had the power to do so in practice, though). And while some Vikings settled in a few places in Normandy, the vast majority of the population of the region were not Vikings. By the time of William the Conqueror, the Normans were definitely considered French considering they are designated by that name on the Bayeux tapestry.\u201d (Thanks to Francis McCarthy for the correction on what Normandy was) In addition to this \u201cThe Normans didn't settle in a deserted area deprived of any civilisation and nobility. The Norman leaders married the local nobility to make the alliance and the people blended. They still had to be vassal to the French king too\u201d (Thanks to George G\u00e9al-Killy for this elaboration on Normandy). The Normans would go on to conquer England and establish themselves as the new ruling class. Again thank you to Francis McCarthy and George G\u00e9al-Killy for the corrections. ",

The English were in France to take the French crown. They were pretty successful at first, but as time went on the French clawed their way. Both sides were exhausted, but the French retained control of their lands and their crown. They won. ",
