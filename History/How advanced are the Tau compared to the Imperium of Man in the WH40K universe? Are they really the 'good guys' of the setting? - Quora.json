            "answer_text": "In some areas they\u2019re actually *below* the imperium, technologically. Fun and obscure bit of lore: Pretty much every faction in Warhammer 40k has *seperately, and idependently* devised a means of literally wrapping an energy field around a physical sword, axe, in the case of at least one tyranid, an actual living organism, to vastly increase both it\u2019s durability and cutting power. Except the Tau. Every blade we ever see Tau use is some sort of conventional sword or spear, the likes of which could be easily turned out rather quickly by any halfway decent garage machinist in the real world. To put this into perspective, the imperium has transonic blades (a weapon that uses literal *sound* to adjust it\u2019s frequency to allow far greater cutting efficiency then it\u2019d otherwise be capable of while also effectively paralyzing the unlucky target with panic) chainblades (motorized rversible direction chainsaws with monoedge blades of exceptional hardness and durability which can rapidly cut through both a lot of infantry and some vehicle armor) power blades (conventional swords literally wrapped in energy to allow them to both potentially cut through just about anything without any real effort at all) force weapons (a melee weapon specifically designed to allow psykers to put their power directly into weapons strikes while also helping function as a focus for their powers) or perhaps most uniqely, the Space wolf Kraken blade (which is literally a chainsword with an energy field which in some editions is literally modulated to produce considerable cold in the target, turning otherwise very strong armor incredibly brittle.) Another common difference people don\u2019t pick up on is that the Imperium of man\u2019s plasma weapons ar legitimately more powerful, and the adeptus mechanicus sends the less stable examples to other service branches even while hoarding the good reliable stuff for themselves. A plasma culverin for example, is best described as an autofire capable longer ranged plasma cannon. Likewise, the imperium has done something no other power in the universe has: Created a functional \u201cperpetual motion machine\u201d that effectively powers itself. The imperium being what they are they largely use it for combat walkers units. Another thing to keep in mind is that the Tau would be completely limited to sublight travel were it not for incorporating a species called the Nicassar as one of their earliest \u201cinvitations\u201d. The Nicassar are a psionic species able to effectively allow craft to enter into the edges of the warp, and because of that, they\u2019re largely responsible for there being A tau expansion phase at all. The Tau do not currently have the ability to build true warp engines, much less then various wards, protective fields, ect necessary to allow a ship to survive warp transit. Their efforts to build such devices have lore wise, all ended in various disastrous and quickly covered up failures. Which reminds me. The Tau have also committed full scale xenocide (wiping out entire sentient species) on several occasions we know of, actively hides evidence of chaos from it\u2019s population, and it\u2019s implied Ethereals straight up mind control other Tau in pursuit of entirely different goals then the \u201cgreater good\u201d.

            "answer_text": "The big difference between tau and imperial technology is that it is much more uniformly distributed. The Imperium has technology vastly superior to anything the tau have, especially the Adeptus Mechanicus but it is usually restricted to those small elite factions due to the inability to build and maintain them as well as not trusting others with that technology thus the majority of the Imperial military (Imperial guard) are forced to use mostly cheap backwards technology with a preference towards ease of manufacture. The Tau have a much smaller and less fractured population and thus the fire caste has access to the best the Earth caste can offer. Hence they have weapons on average much better then the guard but also much harder to produce on the scale of weapons like lasguns but they lack anything akin to the archaeotech wonders the imperium possess. An analogy would be the imperium is somewhat like ww2 nazi germany aircraft and tanks. They have a few very good designs but not enough of them so they are forced to make use of objectively worse but more common designs to properly arm their forces. In comparison the tau have an intermediate design (i.e sherman, t-34) that is better then the common crap design but worse then the rare best design that they are able to arm their entire force with. Regarding the good guys or the bad guys the Tau are essentially a cross between the worst part of the Caste System of India and the Soviet Union. They have an ideal where every citizen has a place in their society and that they will contribute heavily in their designated role even at the expense of the self for the betterment of the empire. For instance a water caste member will never be allowed to take up farming, military service, medical studies etc\u2026 they will be forced to become diplomats, spokesfish, or merchants. Same with the fire caste. The only career they can take is military. All tau are brainwashed into this midset by propaganda and brainwashing of such a degree it would make the Hitler youth seem balanced and objective. Assimilated aliens are threated the same but even more restrictively that will eventually result in sterilization and extermination for any who do not wholly yeild to the ideals of the Greater Good at which point they will be subdivided amongst a caste based on their basal abilities with no regard for their thoughts on the matter. And while the Tau do typically attempt diplomatic assimilation it is primarily because of how much cheaper it is in the long run compared to military conquest which is always on hot standby in case the offer is rejected. While they may seem marginally better then the imperium keep in mind they\u2019re not on a perpetual total war footing against essentially everything in the galaxy for thousands of years. they have only very recently (Post Damocles) even taken the first steps towards militarizing their empire. Essentially the tau are a cookie cutter repressive expansionist empire (think Romulans, Cardassians, or Galactic Empire from Star Wars) in a universe where everything is turned up to 11 in the grief and misery department making them seem benign to benevolent in comparison to the batshit insanity of the other factions.
