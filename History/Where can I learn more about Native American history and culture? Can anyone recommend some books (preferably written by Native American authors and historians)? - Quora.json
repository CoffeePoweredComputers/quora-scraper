            "answer_text": "I would suggest you pick one particular tribe or subgroup and focus on their history and culture. Native American history & culture is too broad and too vast; there are few similarities, for instance, between the nomadic horse tribes of the western US and the urban dwellers of the Incan empire, but both are Native American cultures. My particular fascination is with the Comanche tribe, a horse culture that dominated half of Texas, half of New Mexico, and much of what is now Oklahoma and Kansas. If you would like to pursue a study of the Comanche, I recommend the following: Comanche: The History of a People, by T. R. Fehrenbach Empire of the Summer Moon, by S. C. Gwynne & David Drummond The Comanche Empire, by Pekka Hamalainen Comanches: Lords of the Southern Plains, by Ernest Wallace & E. Anderson Hoebel The Comanche Code Talkers of WW2, by William Meadows & Jean O. Charney Comanche Land by J. Emmer Harston Comanche Dictionary & Grammar, by James Armagost and Lila Robinson A Grammar of Comanche, by Jean Ormsbee Charney Comanche Vocabulary, by Daniel J. Gelo The Comanche Language & Cultural Preservation Committee also has a website: The Comanche Language | Comanche Language & Cultural Preservation | Elgin, Oklahomacomanche language, comanche, learning comanche, comanche history Elgin, Oklahomahttp://www.comanchelanguage.org/ As does the Comanche Nation: Home | Comanche NationDue to a water leak, the Comanche National Museum and Cultural Center will be closed Monday October 19th, 2020. The museum will\u00a0re-open on Tuesday October 20th, 2020 at 8am.https://comanchenation.com/ ",

            "answer_text": "Beyond visiting tribes and listening to their elders here are some suggestions: Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West by Dee Brown Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation by John Ehle An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States (REVISIONING HISTORY) by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz Hanta Yo by Ruth Beebe Hill any of the Leaphorn and Chee books by Tony Hillerman (The latter two are \u201cpopular\u201d novels but it\u2019s clear the authors did their research) There are also several chapters in T.A. Lawson\u2019s textbook called, I believe, \u201cHistory of the West and Wyoming\u201d. It\u2019s long out of print but he had access to the closed Wyoming Archives for his research.

With the casinos owned by various tribes all over, most tribes have established cultural centers of various names nearby the casinos. You get the history from the viewpoint of the tribal members. There are two within 50 miles of my home and many more within 200 miles. I Googled \u201cindian cultural centers and museums\u201d and got hundreds of results. ",

            "answer_text": "The study of the early immigrants to the Americas, commonly called Native Americans, has been muddied by myth and romance. To read anything approaching truth, one must tread carefully. They have been portrayed as demons and as spiritually driven folk, living in balance with nature. Neither extreme gets close to the truth. Their history is varied and filled with villains and heroes, just as the study of any group of human beings would be. ",
