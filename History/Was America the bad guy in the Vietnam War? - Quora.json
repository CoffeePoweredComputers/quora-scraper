            "answer_text": "Yes.  America Was the \u201cbad guy\u201d.  But to be the bad guy in such a huge and horrible crime against humanity, is much more than just being \u201cthe bad guy\u201d.  Learning the Truth about Vietnam is like waking up form the \u201cmatrix\u201d and realizing that everything you have learned all your life is wrong.  That the Truth has deliberately been kept hidden from you! OK.  Who thinks I\u2019m already being to harsh with my \u201cterminology\u201d? Vast Crimes Against Humanity - click here. If you study the history of the region, you find the Vietnamese had been struggling against foreign invaders, colonizers, and oppressors for a long time, including the Chinese, Japanese, and French.  Ho Chi Minh was a leader of the Vietnamese resistance and was a friend of the USA, and worked with and helped Americans during World War II when the Japanese occupied the area. After World War II ended, the Vietnamese looked forward to freedom and independence, and cooperation and friendship with the USA.  But the United States stabbed them in the back, and supported the French colonizers who were very brutal and injust.  Later Americans continued in their place.  We had no legitimate government that we were helping in South Vietnam.  The USA-CIA were basically funding and supporting Vietnamese warlords; these warlords worked on corruption and violence and had little democratic support.  The USA actually participated in a coup against their own partners in South Vietnam, and the assassination of those leaders. American leaders knew that all Vietnamese people were essentially supporting national independence, and that was what  they were fighting for.  Elections were scheduled in the Geneva Accords, but the CIA disrupted those elections, because they knew that Ho Chi Minh and his nationalist resistance forces had widespread support throughout the country! Just think about it!  You chafe under brutal colonial servitude under the French, including brutal economic and violent weapons being used against your country.  You finally get rid of the French oppressors, and this horrendously violent, vicious, racist, ignorant and stupid, monster comes in and devastates your nation like no other.  Americans were not protectors, and we were not fighting for our \u201cfreedom\u201d. We were fighting for our military industrial complex overlords, and we were fighting to keep the Vietnamese as humble slaves! When it comes to estimating the level of suffering the Vietnamese experienced due to our American Crimes Against Humanity, estimates go up to several million.  Moderate estimates suggest at least 2.5 Million dead Vietnamese civilians died.  The demoniacs who love the military and feel they are entitled to kill people, those people will wail and moan and insist that the number of civilians who were killed in no way approaches more than 200,000 civilians; or even 25,000.  In whatever case, don\u2019t let such obfuscation by demoniacs confuse you.  Picture 25,000 people at a huge concert, or a small town, or at a stadium on Sunday for a professional football game; and then picture them all dead inn boxes. No answer me a question,  if you personally kill  20 people, do you think you can plead innocent on the basis that you only really murdered two?  You see the logic?  One murder will get you 25 years in jail.  The brutal kinds of murder our soldiers committed would merit the death sentence in many jurisdictions in the USA.  So whether it is 2 million or 20 thousand, we are guilty.  But I can tell you that the scale is far, far higher than you can even conceive.  So yes.  America was the bad guy, and still is.  We were warned against the US Military Industrial Complex. And as to our \u201cveterans\u201d, they were all ignorant.  They killed endless numbers of people because everyone else was doing it. Because they thought it was \u201clegal\u201d, because it was respectable, because the \u201cauthorities\u201d told them they were good.  The same thing happened in Nazi Germany.

            "answer_text": "Let me say this about wars in history, we have two criterion we must judge them by. 1.) the standard of the time, we have to look at what's normal, otherwise looking back on people like the Romans we would think of them as bloodthirsty debased savages, yet they were quite civilized.2.) In war there are no good guys and bad guys, just soldiers who play to win. Now let's look at socialism in Asia and see how it turned out. Let's look at Mao's China which was really our only basis to judge how communism would work out in Asia. Well Mao killed off more Chinese citizens than Hitler. In his great leap foward about 45 million Chinese citizens died. I hate to sound negative but it wasn't looking to good for Asian communists. The United States had a perfectly valid reason to go into Vietnam. While we seem cruel and heartless in our actions our perspective of communism in Asia wasn't looking great. Now let me get into my real point. Almost every conflict is more or less about resources or markets and not morals. My case and point is the most recent Iraqi war with Sadam Hussein dying and all. Throughout much of the Cold War into the 1970s and 80s he was our staunch ally. We had sold him discreetly WMDs during the Iran Contra affair. The Iranians and Iraqis used WMDs sold to them by the US. When you here about WMDs we knew for certain he had chemical weapons that qualified, we probably had the receipts lying around. It wasn't really a fight over his WMDs we sold him, we knew he wasn't really a problem with that. We also knew that his brutal human rights violations go back a long time, we didn't care. We knew his party had direct ties to the Nazis and that his uncle who was Sadam's mentor had strong ties with Hitler in WW2. We fought with Iraq over oil. More specifically he wanted to move toward a European currency system and exchange, in order to secure our European markets and continue making a stupid profit we went to war and ended up killing Sadam. I guess you could say we were good for toppling him, but we knew about him for years and had helped create some of his problems. In the end wars aren't about good or bad, it's how we decide to view them later. ",
