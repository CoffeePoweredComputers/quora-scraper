            "answer_text": "This may be (unintentionally) a trick question. Many of the most famous figures historically who served as vice-president eventually became famed and illustrious (or controversial) presidents. These include Adams, Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Nixon, and H.W. Bush. Surely their stars rose brighter when they became president, but they are all \u201cmemorable vice presidents,\u201d even if not for their service as vice president. Most of the most memorable vice presidents who never became president are remembered because they were in some way knavish, controversial, or laughable. These include Aaron Burr, John C. Calhoun, Henry Wallace, Dan Quayle, and Dick Cheney. So, by the process of elimination, and excluding the names you see in either of the categories above, I am going to choose: Al Gore. Bill Clinton\u2019s VP for eight years, winner of the popular vote for president (though not the presidency) in 2000, lay climate scientist who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his important warnings to people about climate change, including the award-winning film \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "John Nance Garner - FDR\u2019s 2nd VP, is known for only coming to DC whn absolutely necessary and for saying that the office of VP \u201cwasn\u2019t worth a bucket of warm piss. \u201c He was not on board with FDR\u2019s policies and was referred to by John L. Lewis as \u201ca labor-baiting, poker-playing, whiskey-drinking, evil old man\". IMHO, that\u2019s strong praise from someone like Lewis. He was replaced because he ran against FDR (very unsuccessfully) for the 1944 nomination and was replaced by Henry Wallace, who was farther left than Roosevelt and was characterized as a fellow traveler.
