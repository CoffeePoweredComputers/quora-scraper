            "answer_text": "Actually, some NT scholars do find mention of the destruction of Pompeii--implied through a detailed description--in Revelation chapter 18. Though not universal, there is significant majority consensus that \"Babylon\" (ch. 17, esp.) in the context of the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD is Rome, just as Babylon conquered Judea and destroyed Jerusalem and the temple before, in 586 BC. The biblical account records that after using Babylon to punish the Southern Kingdom (Judah), God caused the downfall of Babylon (Isaiah 13-14, Jeremiah 50-51) as punishment for their own wickedness. Rome as Babylon in Revelation 17 is used to punish \"Jerusalem\"--a euphemism for Judea--and is punished itself by God through plague, famine, and fire in chapter 18. The description of \"fallen Babylon\" is uncanny in it's accuracy of the destruction of Pompeii in 79 AD and the other calamities the Roman Empire experienced during the first year of the reign of Titus who, incidentally, led the invasion of Jerusalem that ended with the destruction of the Second Temple. I believe there is sufficient evidence here that Pompeii at least partly is in view here: 4 Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, \u201cCome out of her, my people, lest you take part in her sins,lest you share in her plagues;5 for her sins are heaped high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.6 Pay her back as she herself has paid back others, and repay her double for her deeds; mix a double portion for her in the cup she mixed.7 As she glorified herself and lived in luxury, so give her a like measure of torment and mourning,since in her heart she says, \u2018I sit as a queen,I am no widow, and mourning I shall never see.\u20198 For this reason her plagues will come in a single day, death and mourning and famine,and she will be burned up with fire; for mighty is the Lord God who has judged her.\u201d9 And the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning. 10 They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, \u201cAlas! Alas! You great city, you mighty city, Babylon!For in a single hour your judgment has come.\u201d11 And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo anymore, 12 cargo of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all kinds of articles of ivory, all kinds of articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble, 13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human souls.[b] 14 \u201cThe fruit for which your soul longed has gone from you,and all your delicacies and your splendors are lost to you, never to be found again!\u201d15 The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud, 16 \u201cAlas, alas, for the great city that was clothed in fine linen, in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, with jewels, and with pearls!17 For in a single hour all this wealth has been laid waste.\u201dAnd all shipmasters and seafaring men, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off 18 and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, \u201cWhat city was like the great city?\u201d19 And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, crying out, \u201cAlas, alas, for the great city where all who had ships at sea grew rich by her wealth!For in a single hour she has been laid waste.20 Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets,for God has given judgment for you against her!\u201d These comments of shipmasters, seafaring men, and sailors were repeated in Pliny the Younger's account of the events, as his uncle (and Admiral), Pliny the Elder, sailed out into the bay of Naples (along with all the war ships) to witness the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the chaos that engulfed Pompeii and Herculaneum. Pliny the Elder died two days later. He continues: \"You could hear the shrieks of women, the wailing of infants, and the shouting of men; some were calling their parents, others their children or their wives, trying to recognize them by their voices. People bewailed their own fate or that of their relatives, and there were some who prayed for death in their terror of dying. Many besought the aid of the gods, but still more imagined there were no gods left, and that the universe was plunged into eternal darkness for evermore.\" Read the biblical account and compare to the eyewitness historical accounts of Pliny, and reach your own conclusion. I remain convinced that both describe the destruction of Pompeii-Herculaneum-Stabiae. See \"Selected Letters of Pliny\", and \"The Letters of the Younger Pliny\". Jeff OsburnBA, MA ",

            "answer_text": "Pompeii, was destroyed around 79 AD. The Old Testament had been written and the New Testament was in progress. Many Scholars believe that the Gospels were not written until after 70 AD and those writings were focused on the life and ministry of Jesus. The epistles were written to the various churches. If there was a Church in Pompeii it would have been destroyed with the city.  From what archeologists have dug up the residents were primarily pagan worshipers and had likely rejected the Gospel because the only thing Christian or Jewish that was found was some writing on a wall that said \"Sodom and Gomorrah\" It is believed that this was written after it's destruction by someone who knew the scriptures and visited the site.
