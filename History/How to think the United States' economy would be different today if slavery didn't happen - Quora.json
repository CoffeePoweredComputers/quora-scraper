            "answer_text": "That is one of the few questions that really interests me. However, all I can offer is speculation from my point of view. Because slavery was all about needing a way to prepare the soil, broadcast the seed, cultivate the plants, harvest the crop and transport it to market for sale. Without the work of slaves, what inventions may have come about sooner because of the need for tools to do what there was no forced laborers to perform. This then leads us to the Dust Bowl pickers in California, then on to the migrant farm workers and how earlier development of improved mechanical farming tools could have affected immigration today because there would have been no need for cheap migrant farm workers. Interesting topic to speculate on. ",

            "answer_text": "Slavery ended a long time ago, if slavery hadn't happened, America would have been poorer up until 1860. So, it would have taken the United States a longer time to catch up with Europe. It took Malaysia and Singapore only 40 years to become developed, and it took the Soviet Union only 30 years to become industrialized. So, I would say America would be just as advanced as it is today, although earlier generations would have been poorer. If the slaves had been treated like ordinary migrants, with human rights and access to the best education, then the United States would have been a global economic power many years earlier. ",
