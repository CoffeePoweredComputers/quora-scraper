BushGeorge W. BushDonald TrumpI see that the other two answers include Andrew Johnson as a Republican. I think that\u2019s nonsense. He spent his entire life as a Democrat, and when Lincoln tagged him to be his running mate in 1864, they called their ticket the \u201cNational Union\u201d ticket to show that they were trying to unite Democrats like Johnson and Republicans like Lincoln. And Johnson never called himself a Republican. ",

Roosevelt, Taft, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush Sr., Bush Jr., and Trump. Although Andrew Johnson\u2019s party affiliation was really Democrat, but since he ran with Lincoln, he often gets considered as a \u201cRepublican.\u201d John Quincy Adams was a \u201cNational Republican,\u201d successor to the Federalist Party, and predecessor to the Whigs, which turned into the modern day Republicans. Also, Jefferson, Madison and Monroe were \u201cDemocrat-Republicans\u201d sometimes called anti-Federalists or just \u201cRepublicans. Maybe add in 4 more \u201cRepublicans\u201d Grand total: maybe up to 24. Or less precisely, somewhere between 19 and 24 presidents were \u201cRepublicans\u201d of some kind. ",
