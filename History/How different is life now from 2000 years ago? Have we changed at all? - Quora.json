            "answer_text": "The only way we can know what life was like is from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. And, that is only what life was like in what is now the Middle East. We have no idea what life was like in the British Isles, Europe or the Scandinavian countries. We know there were Indigenous people living in North and South America as well. Based on the little knowledge we have I would think they were in much better physical condition than we are when it came to physical strength, and not so much when it came to health. They would have little or no understanding of the causes of diseases and what caused the weather that ruined their crops, etc. We know from reports that there was a lot more cruelty than now. We look at what is happening and shudder, but that was nothing compared to the horrors of the past. Back then, there were few stable borders then, so lots of fights over which land belonged to whom. There were no communication devices so messages could take weeks to get to their destination. If you didn\u2019t have a horse or mule, you did a lot of walking to get where you wanted to be. Everything had to be done by hand. Grinding the wheat, making the tools, and hunting for food. Women had to go to the shore to wash clothes and gather water. On the way, they often faced rape and death. Perhaps that\u2019s why they tried to stay in groups as much as possible. Life seemed to have little value and there were great cruelties. I\u2019m not sure if the methods of torture were available then, but we do know they were in the Dark Ages. ",

            "answer_text": "Comparing life now from 2000 years ago one would find certainly many differences because in spite of on those times there be already some developing the similarities of those days with the ones of today can be only seen at the level of the buildings that existed on that time and that exist today, that is, 2000 years ago there already was some fortification buildings like there was all over Man\u2019s History, but concerning the others aspects like, for instance, the objects that society of before and society of today use for it\u2019s living were very different and on the majority those objects didn\u2019t exist yet, so one can see how would be so different from those days of 2000 years ago until now.

Your wealth was measured in land ownership, armies, gold, silver, and slaves depending on your station in life. ",
