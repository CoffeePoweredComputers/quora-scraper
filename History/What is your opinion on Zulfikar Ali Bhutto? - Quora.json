            "answer_text": "The PPP was founded by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1967. For those who believe in Democracy here are some hard truths about ZAB. He first came into Prominence under President Iskander Mirza in 1958 , before joining hands with Field Marshall Ayub Khan , The first martial law administrator. He became Ayub's Foreign Minister in 1963 before parting with him and forming a left wing party in 67.In The 1970 General Elections the PPP won 81 Seats to Awami leagues 160... just half, but Bhutto was not willing to concede PM'ship to the East Pakistan Winners. In a famous address to his elected Parliamentarians he threatened them with 'breaking their legs' if they dared to go to Dacca for the National Assembly session. He told Shaikh Mujeeb that you be PM of East Pakistan while I will become PM of West Pakistan. After a civil war in The Eastern Wing, they broke away and formed Bangladesh. Wow Democracy at its finest. His next step on the road to Democracy was overthrow of the elected governments of NWFP (Present day KPK) and Balochistan and imprisoning all the leaders of opposition. Again landmark case of Hyderabad Tribunal 1974 was filed with treason charges against all of opposition to consolidate power. Senior leaders like Khan Abdul Wali Khan head of NAP (now ANP) , and Khair Baksh Marri, were imprisoned and held in jail till Another Dictator Gen Zia ul Haq released them in 1977. The 1977 elections are considered to be the most rigged elections in The history of Pakistan and Bhutto himself accepted he had done rigging and promised to cancel elections and hold another...of course Gen Zia intervened and jailed him.... Note. ZAB accepted rigging but only promised to hold another elections instead, no Punishment for himself for trying to Steal the Mandate of the Public. Bhutto definitely did some good things like Simla Peace Agreement after the 1971 war, getting back the 93000 Imprisoned soldiers , Hosting of the Islamic Conference in 1974, the road to nuclear Armament was started by ZAB, etc While ZAB was a great leader he was not Democratic.... his political career started under one martial Law in 1958 and ended under another in 1977. PPP leaders term Bhutto's death by hanging as Judicial Murder and I agree with that...his trial was a mockery of Justice but isn't it said, THOSE WHO LIVE BY THE SWORD SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD.

            "answer_text": "I do not know if my opinion will be welcomed but as an Indian I want to answer this as this answer does not explicitly ask only pakistanis to answer. So I will talk of his positives and negatives separately. Positives: Founded OIC which greatly benefitted pakistan. Pakistan got better ties with many countries and many regions started looking up to pakistan. Pan-islamism was the reasons many kashmiris shifted their loyalties from India (they actually helped Indian forces to identify infiltrators in the 1965 war), baloch militancy was pacified after their revolt in 1972\u201373 and many added benefits.Nuclear program was conceived under him. The only thing which saved pakistan from direct invasion by India or US in present times is nuclear weapons.Alliance with China was forged when he was foreign minister under Ayub Khan government in 1963. China was also a strong ally for pakistan during his premiership. He even facilitated in US-China improved relations.Abrogated State Subject Rule in PoK and made it de-facto pakistani. No more \u2018bohot azaad kashmir\u2019.Introduced socialistic reforms for pakistan and stood up against crony capitalism, although he could not do much on that path as Zia stopped him with the backing of US as US conspired to kill every single socialist in muslim countries where they almost largely succeeded.Tricked Indira Gandhi into releasing 93000 POWs and still not having to give up PoK, he pulled off a very profitable deal if we see it from a perspective of a leader of a nation humiliatingly defeated in war.Negatives: He was very racist towards bengalis. He did not let Sheikh Mujibur Rahman become Prime Minister even after getting majority and more than double the votes just because he was a bengali. He used derogatory remarks for bengalis in his speeches. He is the prime reason pakistan lost half of their country in the form of bangladesh after inhuman torture by the pakistan army.He removed the political leaders in baluchistan and imprisoned them, and ordered a military operation where too many people died. USSR supported baloch independence due to their designs of having a warm water port by annexing afghanistan and then baluchistan. His response was a little too brutal, although he made it up after negotiating with many baloch like Bazinjo.The islamisation of pakistani society was started by Bhutto to appease the Saudis and many clerics were given political mileage. He even declared Ahmadis as non-muslims and their persecution is among the worst till today. Ahmadis have been very dedicated citizens for pakistan, even if they were not to be considered muslims, they should have got some rights as a community.He was very shady and corrupt in some matters which gave Zia a window to depose him.He armed the mujahideen in afghanistan to counter soviet influence and \u2018strategic depth\u2019 which much later became the taliban and Al Qaeda which resulted in the quagmire of islamic terrorism in south asia and middle east.Overall I would say that although he did good things, his tenure was mostly bad for pakistan and cumulatively south asia. He has direct responsibility (along with some others) for many burning issues in south asia. World would have been better off without him. ",
