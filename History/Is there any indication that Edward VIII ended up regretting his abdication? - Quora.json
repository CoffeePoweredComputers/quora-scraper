Everyone needs to feel useful - to be working towards goals, to feel they are building something, part of something, or accomplishing something - even if it\u2019s just raising a family. Neither he or his wife really took up any kind of career, passionate hobby, area of study or serious cause or philanthropy. They never had children - which would have given them some sort of focus. I think they had very empty sad lives, with a lot of time to regret their choices. ",
