            "answer_text": "As someone who has worked for corporates all of her life, I do feel qualified to answer this question. Working in a corporate environment for 20 years has taught me this: You will always be just a number. What do I mean by this? let me explain further. To be successful and grow your career in a large, global corporate, you have to be dedicated. And I don't mean only between  8 - 5. It means working after hours, volunteering on committees, showing inititative, going the extra mile etc. Literally putting your heart and soul into the job, missing out on family time and important personal events because the company needs you. But when the time comes to make cuts, reduce overhead, restructure, call it what you like, all of that is forgotten. Sure, your local boss many try and save your job, but he has a boss, and that boss has a boss and so on. At the end of the days, you, as a manager, get told you need to reduce headcount by 2 people. And you will try and try to find a way around it but if you cant.. guess what? you get rid of 2 hard working people...   I guess it is the nature of the game. I have been the junior employee who got told to leave and I am now the manager telling someone they have been let go. Corporates have to be beasts by nature to survive and the logic is; If you have gangrene in one finger and you leave it, it spreads. So you have to cut off the hand to save the rest of the body!! They don't call it a jungle for nothing! ",

            "answer_text": "I have been working in the corporate sector for 4 years now, sharing my own experience here; Being a corporate employee there are a lot of things which I like and dislike, but there is a thing which I really dislike. There are no fix parameters of growth, no commitments, everything is so uncertain and indefinite. Nobody knows what exactly one can do to get growth in career. sometimes it depends on your boss if he/she likes you then no one can stop you but if the situation is opposite then remember your God for help. Also, reporting manager changes very frequently and again you need to prove your capabilities to the new one because as I mentioned there are no certain parameters and records which you can show them as proof. Things should be like, at the time of process/project joining, KRAs should have been told by managers with definite conditions of appraisal and promotions. So there would be no chaos at the time of appraisals, everyone would be very well aware of his/her performance and achievements and things will be on the same page for all. In the current scenario, we just do our work, sit back and hope for the good and performance letters comes as a surprise or shock for employees. STAY HAPPY AND FOCUSED:) ",
