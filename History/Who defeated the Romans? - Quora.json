            "answer_text": "Many peoples defeated the Romans in battle, as has been mentioned by Cris ZH, but if you mean ' who overthrew them?' then that would be the mounted armies of Huns, and other tribes with cavalry armies. The romans were unbeatable in a clash of foot soldiers, they had discipline, good arms and armour and effective tactics. Yet , against host that came at them on horseback, shooting arrows then veering away to return, they were helpless. Too slow to catch up with horsemen , if they stood and fought, the cavalry troops stood off at a distance and wore the enemy down with mounted archery fire or outmaneuvered them . The Roman cavalry had no stirrups and the barbarians who did had another advantage in that they could charge and press home the attack , rather than simply skirmish. this, and the weight of numbers would drive Roman cavalry units from the field, leaving the infantry at a grave disadvantage.

            "answer_text": "The shortest answer would be a series of invasions/tactics to bring Rome to its knees by Germanic tribes (i.e. The Visigoths), then from an area called Gaul. They basically surrounded the city (which was walled in) and cut off all food supplies entering and destroyed their aqueducts so Romans had no access to fresh water. People started dying from starvation and dehydration and the Romans couldn't keep up with burying them due to the sheer scale of death. This, of course, spreads disease that kills other Romans, and so on and so forth. Of course there's more to this, but that's your basic answer. I recommend a book I had to read in college called \u201cAre We Rome?\u201d You can get it on Amazon for like, $4. It explains all of that, as well as how different and alike the US is to the Roman Empire. ",
