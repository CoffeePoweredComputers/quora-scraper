            "answer_text": "No Louisiana Purchase means US Treasury is $15 dollars richer. Maybe little less of a chance for the War of 1812 since Britain might be less angry at us since we didn\u2019t give France $15 million to build up their military. Toussaint L\u2019Overture might still win independence for Haiti because France would have military in Louisiana. Less chance for a War with Mexico since Louisiana might be a buffer. Less chance for expansion of slavery because France would probably oppose slavery in Louisiana. This also might mean less chance for Civil War since there would be less chance of Westward Expansion. No Westward Expansion means no Texas, no California, no Gold Rush (at least for Americans), maybe no Hollywood, Las Vegas, no St. Louis arch, no St. Louis Cardinals or any baseball, football, basketball, or hockey teams west of the Mississippi River. Less chance of major wars against Indigenous Peoples west of the Mississippi River. US industry might miss many of the natural resources west of the Mississippi. Would US become involved in Spanish American War, World War One or Two, Korean or Vietnam War, or Persian Gulf War? Would the US develop Nuclear Weapons or a Space Program? Would the US become an isolated country? Who knows? ",

            "answer_text": "When Thomas Jefferson purchased the Louisiana Territory from France, he altered the shape of a nation and the course of history. The purchase nearly doubled the size of the United States. By any measure, it was one of the most colossal land transactions in history, involving an area larger than today\u2019s France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Holland, Switzerland and the British Isles combined. The purchase would make America wealthy from the gold, silver and other ores. Also at the time, we gained endless lands for grazing, farming and forests. I doubt very much that we would have explored and expanded west to the Pacific ocean and would probably not have ever become a world power.   Credit to both images to Wikipedia ",
