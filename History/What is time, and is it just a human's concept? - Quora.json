            "answer_text": "\u201cTime\u201d, in its strictest sense, is the most fundamental aspect of reality. Look at the credentials of everyone that says otherwise - not one of them has any professional background in regards to any study or research into the nature of time or temporal mechanics, which is the study of time outside of relativity, which focuses primarily on Einstein\u2019s notion of spacetime. What\u2019s the difference? Although space and time can be viewed as inextricably connected, each has a separate role and relativity focuses primarily on that relationship and not on the nature of time itself. For example, space is where things are and events take place. However, that can only happen because time is connected to all aspects of space and without time, nothing could happen and thus, nothing could exist. Time is more than just a measurement, in fact we have a word for time in that regard - \u201cduration\u201d. However, duration isn\u2019t used enough ans instead time is and that contributes to the confusion and misconception about it. It\u2019s easy to see how all definitions of time being just a human concept or simply a measurement, are shallow and pedestrian, once you try to apply that reasoning to higher or advanced physics. One simple example would be to look at one of the biggest questions in physics in relation to time - the asymmetry problem. Most people who believe that time is just a way to make measurements probably have never heard of the asymmetry problem, and if they haven\u2019t, they don\u2019t have the right to even comment on questions about time. The asymmetry problem deals with the question of why we only see things happen in a straight forward direction of effect following cause. Stephen Hawking famously tackled this problem, which I wrote about in detail in my book on him, Space Warps and Time Tunnels. Now that obviously has nothing to do with measuring anything or the idea of duration. So just that one aspect, out of all the issues dealing with the nature of time, shows that the idea that time just measures motion and duration, is inane, and denying that time is physical, is just a concept in the imaginations of many people who have failed to, for reasons of fear, laziness, or arrogant ignorance, think they can pretend to be experts on the most complicated concept from physics that actually should require a PhD in both quantum physics and relativity - or the work equivalent, to even be allowed to have an opinion on it.

            "answer_text": "Time is a concept but I wouldn\u2019t use the word \u201cjust\u201d as if this concept was somehow \u201cjust\u201d a human concept, because of how useful this concept is for us. Time is the metric of changes; it measures rates and durations of observed actions according to universally accepted standards of measure. Think of the utility of this concept for us; it is considerable. And often, the word time is used as a proxy for the change it measures, for example, motion. Motion is real, it is physical, things really move; time measures that motion and when the measuring tool gets used as a proxy for the thing it is measuring, it takes on the \u201caura\u201d of being physical, as has happened with the concept of time in the imaginations of many people who now talk about time as if it was physically real. They say strange things like, the beginning of time, or, the end of time, etc. This is not correct, of course, and that seems to be why you asked this particular question. ",
