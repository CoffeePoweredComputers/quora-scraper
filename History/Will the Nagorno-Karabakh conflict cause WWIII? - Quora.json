            "answer_text": "Only if worst case scenario happens. Armenia has a defence alliance with Russia, and is on good terms with Iran, whilst Azerbaijan has a defence alliance with Turkey, a NATO ally, and there have been allegations of Turkish involvement in the shooting down of an Armenian fighter jet. On top of that, Azerbaijan has allegedly been backed by Syrian opposition mercenaries (supplied by Turkey) and has also received arms from Israel. There are now two groups of rival factions in alliances with participants or involved countries in this war. They are: The Iran- Israel rivalry, which if you believe reports of Israeli- Saudi co-operation then this could be extended to include the Saudi- Iran rivalry, which has stimulated a destructive cold War in the Middle East.The NATO- Russia rivalry. This includes powerful economies such as the U.S, U.K, France and Germany, as well as Russia and the members of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO)Now how does that become a world war? Well we've been in a similar situation to this before, in 1914, albeit a more extreme position back then, however that doesn't mean we're not in a dangerous situation now. I think this will become a major Middle East war if Iran thinks that the use of Syrian mercenaries in Azerbaijan will help Bashir Al- Assad in Syria, by removing them from that civil war, or if Israel directly begins to use the conflict to further its interests in the region. My belief is that Iran would be much more likely to militarily intervien if the latter situation out of the two happened, as if the former happened then I can imaging it would simply fund and supply the Armenian government. If the latter happens, and Israel used the war as an opportunity to further its own interests (by sending troops or proxies) then I think Iran may be provoked into responding militarily, as Azerbaijan is on Iran's doorstep, and this could leave them exposed. If Iran piled in militarily, and attacked Israeli forces then the Middle East would be plunged into a massive conflict, as allies such as Syria, Iraq and Lebanon would probably get involved (remember Qasim Soleimeni was quietly building a friendly corridor of power to the Israeli border) and Israel could see a direct attack. Iranian intervention also risks war with Turkey if its assets or God forbid its forces (should they be deployed) were attacked, or if Iran and Israel go to war. They would find themselves on the opposite side to Iran and forced into the arms of Israel in such a situation. With Iran and Israel at war, or Iran and Turkey at war or all three at war, Im unsure how Saudi would respond. My gut instinct is that they wouldn't however I\u2019m equally sceptical whether they would simply sit back as Iran fights to dominate the Middle East. Such a war between Israel and Iran, or Turkey and Iran or all three would draw in NATO, either out of support of Israel or Turkey, or both. This would ultimately be a world war. The other possibility for it to escalate into a world war is if Russia Backs Armenia military, and this brings it into direct conflict with Turkey. If this happens and Russia attacks Turkey then Article 5 of the NATO treaty might be triggered, causing a Russia- NATO war, which would ultimately be a world war. In my opinion however, I think while the potential for escalation is there, I think this war will just become a proxy war, owing to the fact that the allies involved, while aggressive, are not so aggressive that they wouldn't allow such an escalation. Ultimately I think this war will simply become a proxy war between the various power blocks in play. ",

            "answer_text": "ause WW3, Absolutely not. This conflict is simply not important enough to cause WW3. A regional war. Armenia and Azerbaijan going to war with Turkey, Russia and others supporting opposing sides, Absolutely. What would be the worse case scenario is a full blown war between both sides. It would bring regional powers into a proxy situation and will bring far away countries. Armenia would get support from France, UAE and KSA, nations who are not anti Azerbaijani but anti Turkey. That could drag Iran, Qatar and others to support Azerbaijani. The cycle would continue. What's really dangerous about this conflict that I find interesting no one in the media or Quora picked up is the fact that no major power as leverage over Armenia and Azerbaijan. The USA is not active in that side of the region with the exception of Georgia and even if they were, the Trump Administration would not do anything. No nation in Europe has serious leverage as they rather be friends with the Azeries (Reliable partner to reduce reliance on Russian gas) Russia supplies arms to both sides and cannot risk alienating the other meaning they will just call a ceasefire. China has no influence here either.This is what makes this conflict very dangerous, no one can really do anything to get them to stop and even more nations have a reason to supply the conflict. ",
