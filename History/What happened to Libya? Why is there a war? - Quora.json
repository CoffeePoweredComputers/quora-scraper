            "answer_text": "To simply put it, back in 2011 during the Arab Spring, NATO-backed forces killed the head of state who had ruled the country for over a long time. He wasn\u2019t nice but he had plans that looked after his people but since he was an enemy of the West and Israel, NATO had to get rid of him. Since his death, the country has been in political chaos and conflicts have arisen from different factions within the country who are trying to gain control over it. Currently the UN recognised Government of National Accord or GNA is facing off with a Tobruk based government headed by Khalifa Haftar who has the backing of the UAE, Egypt, Russia, Israel, France and Saudi Arabia.
