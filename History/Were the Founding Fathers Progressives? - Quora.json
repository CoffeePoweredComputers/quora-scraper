            "answer_text": "No, not really. First, you must be cautious of a logical error that people make. The word \u201cprogressive\u201d can mean dangerously different things: There is the post-Enlightenment philosophical concept of \u201cprogressivism\u201d that appeared roughly 1650\u20131850, which refers roughly to the iterative improvement in civilization through new understandings, truths, science, arts, industry, and so on.There is the post-1890 political ideology of \u201cprogressivism\u201d which refers to the centralization of State power under the guise of democracy with the right to rule vested in an elite, wealthy ruling class who should use \u201cscientific management\u201d to run the government and economy for the benefit of all. (After the 1950s, \u201cprogressivism\u201d became the politically acceptable phrase for \u2018socialism\u201d.)So, if you\u2019re going to say \u201cprogressive\u201d, you really have to know which of these things you mean. Or else, you will confuse two entirely different ideas. Worse yet, Type 2 progressives often profess to hold Type 1 values. So they throw the word around with reckless abandon. Were the Founding Fathers Type 1 progressives? Yes, very much. At least, many of the influential Founding Fathers held views that were \u201cphilosophically progressive\u201d for their day. Were the Founding Fathers Type 2 progressives? No, absolutely not. You will find a no Founding Fathers expressing the unique tenets of Type 2 progressivism. They did actually use a very different phrase for Type 2 progressive: \u201cabsolute tyranny.\u201d  Today, you will find some historically revisionist progressives selectively quoting a few Founding Fathers\u2014mostly Thomas Jefferson. And they do this especially regarding taxes. But when you they cherry-pick such quotes, they often lose the context the quotes were made in. Progressives quite quickly forget that these are the same group of people who declared independence and fought a war against a powerful empire. For, among many other reasons, a rather tiny tax on tea. ",

            "answer_text": "The Founders were Revolutionaries! \u201cProgressive\u201d is a currently politicized label I am wary of, as viewers will immediately read different biases onto it. The video does early reference the Progressive Movement of a century ago to place limits on the power of concentrated industrial wealth, something that Hamilton might not have been enthusiastic about. Progress as a concept was certainly a prominent feature of the Enlightenment which influenced many of the Founders. The video has many great examples from the early USA that might surprise today\u2019s \u201cconservatives\u201d. One point I would emphasize even more than this video is the degree of diversity and conflict among the Revolutionaries, and evolution over time. If we look for an \u201coriginal intent\u201d, the biggest one they had in common was compromise and realistic ambitions, in order to make the coalition work, and still they barely avoided many pitfalls. The contemporary example to compare is the French Revolution, whose radicalism Jefferson remained enthusiastic about for too long, leading to some of his more unrealistic quotations. The American Revolution also had waves of populist radicalization followed by reaction and consolidation, but with more agreement and less violence. The Religious Right\u2019s approach to the Revolution is actually quite similar to their treatment of the Bible \u2014 from a riot of dramatic historic conflict, they somehow get a homogenous corps of elders laying down eternal dogma.
