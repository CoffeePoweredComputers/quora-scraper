            "answer_text": "The central part of West Africa more often than anywhere else, but ultimately all over. Most captives were taken in West Africa, at least initially. And there was a vague correlation between where slave ships started out in Africa and where they ended up in the New World. More northerly ports served North America most often, while ships from more southerly ports tended to go to Brazil more often. But there wasn\u2019t a simple one-to-one correspondence. Ships from any port might go anywhere in the Americas. Minimizing north-south sailing saved time and money, but something from a relatively northerly African port could still go to a port in South America. There were also multiple sources of slaves. West African slavers increasingly turned to sources of captives farther and farther inland, taking them from various places in central Africa, and some slaves were brought in by the Portuguese from East Africa. And once they reached the New World, slaves continued to be moved around. The Americas had an active slave trading economy. Slaves might be shipped from Barbados to Alabama or Mexico to Brazil. Already displaced Africans and their New World-born progeny could end up anywhere as the demands of the market took them. ",
