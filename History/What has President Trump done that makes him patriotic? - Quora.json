            "answer_text": "After sifting through some of the responses and putting aside the catty innuendos, it appears that we agree that a \u201cpatriot\u201d is someone who loves and serves their country. Most go on to excoriate President Trump inasmuch as it\u2019s their opinion that his love and service falls short of the mark. Well, let\u2019s look at that. Does President Trump love America? Seems to me that he does. He goes out of his way to publicly demonstrate his respect not only for the nation but also those who serve it. He never passes up a chance to troop the line of police officers who turn out to provide security wherever he goes. How often have you seen that before? He never passes up a chance to show proper respect to the flag. Sadly, we\u2019ve seen many examples recently of high ranking office holders not only failing to show proper respect, but also showing disrespect for the symbols of the nation. He also is indiscriminate in his actions to all Americans, showing respect to people of all races, religions, ethnicity, etc. Yes, he has show proper disrespect towards criminal illegal aliens and those with an agenda use that incident to claim he is a racist. But let\u2019s not quibble over details. How about service to the nation. Well, he is serving without taking a cent for his service. He didn\u2019t have to. Some complain that he dodged the draft. No argument there. He didn\u2019t serve. He claims that he had a physical condition that disqualified him. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not, so I can\u2019t pass judgment. Unfortunately, others who don\u2019t know, claim to have absolute knowledge that he had no such physical disability and damn him as a draft dodger. Sorry, but I don\u2019t put much confidence in their claims. You may. That\u2019s your business. One thing that\u2019s important to me is his adherence to the Constitution. That may not be important to you, but that\u2019s the core of our nation. Just like the President, I took an oath to preserve, protect and defend it against all enemies foreign and domestic. It appears to me that he\u2019s doing a better job of that than most elected officials I\u2019ve seen in recent times. Indeed, a couple have made it their mission in life to fundamentally change it (after swearing the oath to it). For me, that helps make President Trump a true patriot. I keep hearing people claim that he\u2019s tyrannical. I don\u2019t see it. Indeed, he has done much to push power away, power that was aggregated by some of his predecessors in contravention to their oaths to the Constitution. I\u2019m sure by now you\u2019ve dismissed me as a \u201cTrumpster\u201d. Go ahead. Nothing I write could disabuse you of that notion. The truth is (and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll call me a liar at this point but you\u2019d be foolish to do so to my face). I \u201crooted for\u201d every other Republican who opposed him in 2016. Living in California, I had watched a successful businessman attempt to govern and fail miserably at it. Having no political experience I didn\u2019t hold much hope for a businessman succeeding as President. But, what the hell, we had a President serve eight years without bringing any experience to the White House as a businessman or a politician. Sure, he was a state legislator and a US Senator, but ducked that service by voting \u201cPresent\u201d in almost every opportunity. Despite my misgivings, I am pleased at what President Trump has accomplished. Even more remarkable is that he has accomplished it despite the constant din of impeachment that began even before he assumed the office. Does all this make him a patriot? It does in my eyes, but that\u2019s just my opinion. Now you may think my opinion is worthless. Go ahead and do your worst. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t bother me. Why? I simply don\u2019t care. In the Army we had a saying: \u201cEveryone has an opinion just like everyone has an a**hole, and they all smell the same.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I tried hard not to comment on this thread, but I couldn\u2019t resist. There are several extraordinary answers provided and I\u2019ll add the perspective of a military combat veteran. By definition, a patriot is a person who vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies or detractors. Going beyond that definition, I personally would include anyone selflessly serving the people of their nation during peacetime, natural disaster and in poverty. With that as the foundation, let\u2019s examine some of the times that President Trump\u2019s actions disparaged actual patriots, since he decided to run for office. Senator John McCain: In a December 1999 interview with Dan Rather, Trump was asked about McCain, who kicked off a presidential bid. He said \u201cHe was captured\u201d and \u201cDoes being captured make you a hero? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d As a presidential candidate in 2015, he derided Sen. McCain\u2019s military service by implying and saying that McCain was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d because he had spent five years in captivity as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. A true patriot would agree Senator McCain was and will always be remembered as a decorated war hero and Statesman. Period.President Trump suggesting that ballots cast by active duty members who are deployed overseas should not be counted in Florida. A patriot would never even suggest this, as it is beyond fathomable.In breaking with tradition (two years in a row) President Trump did not visit Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial holiday. A patriot would honor fallen service members as a sign of respect, especially if they \u201clove our military.\u201dAdmiral McRaven: President Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that? Everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\u201d This was in response to the Admiral\u2019s comment that Trump referring to the free press as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d is the greatest threat to democracy. Anyone that knows military operations knows the CIA did the \u2018finding\u2019 and McRaven\u2019s special operators did the \u2018getting.\u2019 Also McRaven\u2019s teams moved within days of President Obama giving the order. A patriot would support this.Gen. Jim Mattis, Gen. John Kelly, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, Gen. Stanley McCrystal, Gen. Michael Hayden, have all been pushed into retirement or publicly criticized by the President. Gen. Joseph Votel, a four-star Army commander and head of the U.S. Central Command indicated that he was not consulted on the withdrawal of U.S troops from Syria. As a patriot and \u201clover of our military\u201d the consultation of military leaders in charge of AoR\u2019s show confidence in our military\u2019s operations.Gold Star Families: Capt. Humayun Khan, Sgt. Dillon Baldridge, and Sgt. La David Johnson are all fallen Warriors that gave their lives in defense of the constitution. Upon their passing, President Trump is on the record for disparaging their families. In the case of Captain Khan, who was Muslim, the President used his death to condemn immigrant and Muslim families on the campaign trail. In the case of Sgt Baldridge, the President told his family he would be sending $25k to aid in their support. He sent it weeks (months) later, after the press received information that he never fulfilled his commitment. In the case of Sgt LaDavid Johnson, during a condolence call, the President attacked Myeshia Johnson, a Gold Star widow by saying \u201cher husband knew what he was signing up for.\u201d He also couldn't remember Sgt LaDavid\u2019s name. These men are warriors and will forever be part of the fabric of our country. Patriotic citizens empathize with their families by honoring their service.Ordering 8,000\u201310,000 troops to the southern border in the name of a \"national emergency\" instead of a humanitarian crisis, especially at a time where military morale is at its lowest, is absurd. When you\u2019re in the service, you rarely have holidays with family members, so taking them away for a non-critical operation is an abuse of power. A patriot would want to ensure high morale of our military.Finally, how could you say that you're a patriot and that you love your nation's military, then declare a national emergency that will divert $3.6 billion earmarked for military construction projects? At a time where military hospitals and infrastructure are crumbling? This shows a lack of respect for military readiness and the Service members willing to put their lives on the line in defense of their nation. A true patriot would ensure the military is properly funded, the troops have a high morale and their facilities/equipment are a priority.While these are only a few instances, the actions of president Trump in office and as a private citizen show the extent to which he is not a patriot. In my opinion, the President is very unpatriotic. ",
