            "answer_text": "Things get a bit lost in the mists of time but the most believable myth surrounding the adoption of the Saltire (St Andrew's Cross) is the Battle of Athelstaneford in 832 where Oengus II (Pictish King) leading the combined Pictish/Scots army against the invading Angles, led by Athelstan, was visited by St Andrew who assured him of victory. On the morning of the battle the clouds formed a St Andrew's Cross against the blue background of the sky. The Picts/Scots went on to victory and the symbol was thus adopted as the national flag. Alternatively, following Bruce's victory in 1314 at Bannockburn, the Declaration of Arbroath officially named St Andrew as the patron Saint of Scotland and in 1385 the Scottish Parliament agreed that Scottish soldiers should wear the white St Andrew's Cross as a distinguishing mark. Either way all these dates preceed the Union of Crowns in 1603 and the Union of Parliaments in 1707 making the Saltire one of the oldest symbols of national identity in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Use of the flag is first recorded with the illustration of a heraldic flag in Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount's Register of Scottish Arms, c. 1542. [5] It is possible that this is based on a precedent of the late 15th century, the use of a white saltire in the canton of a blue flag reputedly made by Queen Margaret, wife of James III (1451\u20131488).
