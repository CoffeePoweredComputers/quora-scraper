            "answer_text": "I think there has been one GAO study on this. There are two main opposed lobbies: I believe: the Coin Coalition, which includes industries like vending machines, which wants the coins, and the Save the Greenback which has support from makers of the specialized paper and the cotton that goes into it. The employees of the bureau of printing and engraving support the latter, because the coin in much cheaper due to far lower wear, which would mean lost jobs. As far as I can tell, this is a debate entirely driven by special interests that deal with the currency on a large scale. It has nothing to do with fostering illusions of low inflation. That said, inflation in the US has been low enough that a lot of things still cost a dollar or less, with a lot more things under $5. Carrying metal change is annoying, especially for men, but $1 is usually too much to leave behind as a tip for small purchases. So the dollar bill is not really a dinosaur. Since I mostly use credit cards, I often have only a few ones and fives. Tens and twenties are for ATM day. This debate may become moot, because electronic payment may gain traction first. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost everywhere else you travel in the world, you can conduct most of your low-value everyday transactions entirely with coins, and it's very convenient.  This is not the case in the U.S.   I was discussing this phenomenon with an Australian friend recently, (in Australia, the currency has been periodically updated with lower-value bills being phased out and replaced by coinage,) and we came to the following conclusion: the American public and financial elite don't want to acknowledge that inflation is happening on the scale that it is. Keeping pennies and $1 bills around allows you to extend the charade of monetary invincibility a little longer.    More frequent periodic adjustments would likely be a lot less painful than ignoring the problem until it requires a full revamp of the currency.   Also see Erik Fair's answer to my question Why does the U.S. keep such low-value coinage in circulation? ",
