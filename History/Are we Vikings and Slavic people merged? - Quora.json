            "answer_text": "There were many Slavic and Baltic pirates (Vikings) in the Baltic sea during the Viking age. For example, the islands of Wolin and Rugen were centers of Slavdom in the Baltic, and also a place of much interaction with Scandinavians. While Norse raided Slavic and Baltic lands in Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia, Slavs also raided Scandinavia. The Wends, a Slavic people in modern day Eastern Germany, raided and pillaged much of Denmark. There is even evidence to suggest that Slavs from Pomerania in modern day Poland settled in Iceland. Yes, Iceland!!! In converse, Viking weapons and armour have been found in Poland, suggesting that some Norse Vikings could have fought for the Piast princes or at least traded with Polish Slavs. I would not be surprised if many modern day Swedes might have small levels of Slavic and Baltic ancestry. The Norse largely depended on thralls, or slaves, to do the farm labor and other work. In Iceland, the Norwegian Norse took many Celts as thralls, and this is shown by modern Icelandic DNA, which is heavily influenced by Celts. Swedish and Danish Norse raiding and trading in the Baltic would most definitely bring Slavic slaves to work for them. Over time, these Slavs and Balts would intermingle with the local Scandinavians. A quick glance at levels of R1A1 (Largely Slavic y haplogroup) is found in moderate to at times high frequency in certain places in Sweden and even Norway. Maybe this is from ancient migrations, but it could also be from mixture of Slavo-Baltic slaves in Scandinavia. ",

            "answer_text": "In early medieval times there were very intensive contacts between Nordmen (if you mean Scandinavians) and Slavs. Have in mind that in Northern Germany there were Slavic states directly neighbouring with Denmark. Scandinavian Vikings had outposts not only in Russia but also in Northern Poland. Viking mercenaries were used by early Polish leaders and actually they fought against other Scandinavians serving in Rus. When it comes to merging many Scandinavians settled in Slavic lands but there was also opposite process. Archeology shows signs of Slavic settlement in Denmark and also Sweden. In XII century Baltic Sea was arena of naval wars between Slavic and Scandinavian states (mostly Denmark) - settlement and getting slaves by both sides also happened. ",
