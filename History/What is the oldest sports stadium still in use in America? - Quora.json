            "answer_text": "In minor league baseball, the Vermont Lake Monsters of the (short season A) New York Penn League play at Centennial Field in Burlington, VT which opened in 1906. In terms of pro sports, that\u2019s about the oldest you\u2019re going to find - maybe there\u2019s a municipal ice arena someplace where beer league teams play, but for real pro sports, it\u2019s Centennial Field. For the major leagues: MLB - Fenway Park, Boston (1912) NFL - Los Angeles Coliseum (1923); the Rams will play at least one more season there. Once they move into their new digs, it will be Soldier Field in Chicago (1924) although the Bears didn\u2019t play there full time until 1971. The longest continuously-occupied NFL stadium is now Lambeau Field which has hosted the Packers every year since 1957. NHL and NBA - Madison Square Garden (1968) is now the oldest for both. Oracle Arena in Oakland, home of the Golden State Warriors, opened in 1966; game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals was the last NBA game ever to be played there. ",
