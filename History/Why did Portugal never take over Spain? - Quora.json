            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. Previous to the Peninsular War (i.e. Napoleonic French invasion), wars between the various Iberian Kingdoms were always due to succession crisis. Due to intermarriage between the royal houses of the Iberian Kingdoms, succession crisis always led to the existence of a foreign (although Iberian) claimant to the crown. This happened in every Iberian kingdom and usually lead to a civil war with a foreign invasion. Castilian kings tried for two or three times to be recognized as the kings of Portugal, and they invaded Portugal, and Portuguese kings tried to be recognized as the kings of Castile or as the kings of Aragon, and they invaded Castile. Only under these conditions would a foreign king be accepted by both the people and the Pope. In fact, any other attempt at seizing a crown would be rejected by the Pope who abhorred wars between Christian princes. In only one occasion a king (the Castilian king) seized a crown under deception: that was the Crown of Navarra. For that, the Castilian king produced some forged documents, including a forged Papal Bull. ",

And Portugal ended up having a small portion of the Iberia, while Spain had a bigger one, and Spain always had bigger army, so the Portugal king never thought of conquering Spain out of respect and knowing that would probably lost.
