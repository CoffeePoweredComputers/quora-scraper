A black man invented the light bulb. not a white guy named Edison. Okay? There's so much. Did anybody know?\" Joe Biden: Why Don't We Teach History? \"A Black Man Invented The Lightbulb, Not A White Guy Named Edison\" A black man L H Latimer was indeed importantly involved in improving the light bulb. See: \u201cLatimer received a patent on January 17, 1882 for the \"Process of Manufacturing Carbons\", an improved method for the production of lightbulb carbon filaments. The Edison Electric Light Company in New York City hired Latimer in 1884, as a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights. While at Edison, Latimer wrote the first book on electric lighting, Incandescent Electric Lighting (1890)\u201d Lewis Howard Latimer - Wikipedia Latimer was indeed seriously involved in improving the light bulb. But he did not invent it. There were patents for light bulbs decades before Latimer and Edison lodged their own applications. See: \u201cHistorians Robert Friedel and Paul Israel list 22 inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Joseph Swanand Thomas Edison. They conclude that Edison's version was able to outstrip the others because of a combination of three factors: an effective incandescentmaterial, a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve (by use of the Sprengel pump) and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable.\u201d Incandescent light bulb - Wikipedia So old SleepyJoe is rewriting history yet again.

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t heard that claim. I suspect that he\u2019s overstating a genuine event for the purposes of appealing to his audience. Here\u2019s the thing, the light bulb (like many inventions in history), don\u2019t have as clear an individual inventor, despite our desires to make it so. Thomas Edison didn\u2019t invent the light bulb, he invented a better light bulb than what was currently on the market. (In point of fact, he oversaw a company that invented a better light bulb. He loved to sell the \u2018lone genius\u2019 myth around himself, but he was a CEO more than he was an inventor). There were electric lights going back to the 1830\u2019s, there were commercially available light bulbs years before Edison came out with his. And then people after him invented improved versions. I\u2019m guessing that there was, somewhere in the early days, a black inventor who created a better version of the light bulb, and we could choose to draw the line there any say that he \u201cinvented\u201d the light bulb. And that claim would probably not be much less plausible than giving the credit to Edison. It\u2019s not an unbiased analysis of history, it\u2019s certainly pandering, but I doubt he was saying it without basis. ",
