            "answer_text": "This is a simplified version of what Columbus did, intended for school children. People who take history courses in high school and university are expected to learn a more nuanced view of the events of 1492. If you look through any history book or book on scholarly or scientific \u201cdiscovery,\u201d the word means \u201cadded to the body of knowledge of Western or Eurasian civilization.\u201d That is what Columbus did. Columbus\u2019s voyage in 1492 was, for good or ill, one of the most important events in all of history. The societies of Asia, Europe, and Africa had been trading culture, genes, and disease vectors for fifty thousand years. The societies of the Americas had been doing the same for about fifteen thousand years. Columbus joined those two separate creations of human civilization together, finally and permanently. The only large-scale human social complexes not part of that new creation were those of Australia and highland New Guinea. You can praise his achievements or denounce his crimes, but the world was changed forever by Christopher Columbus. ",

BUT\u2026.this American history in the U.S. give (C.C.) and others so much credit and recognition of discovering and/or creating something but fail to really educate the masses of the people here in U.S. about the REAL history of how this Americus really came into existence!! As far as what I researched and believe C.C. really didn\u2019t discover anything?? I have always been confused about what I was being taught in the American school system about this American history. I don\u2019t understand how someone like (C.C.) can so-called discover this Americus when people were already living on the land happily?? How about re-writing the history about C.C. and teaching the truth that C.C. stumbled across the Americus (he never discovered nothing). And that C.C. notice people were already living on the land and he became curious and wanted to know about how the people were living\u2026again he (being C.C.) stumbled across this new land that is so-called Americus!!!
