            "answer_text": "There are three mediaeval or earlier churches or cathedrals in England which have been designated World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Canterbury Cathedral, St Augustine's Abbey, and St Martin's ChurchWestminster Abbey and St Margaret's Church (and the nearby Palace of Westminster)Durham Cathedral (and the nearby castle) St Martin's Church, Canterbury St Martin's Church is the oldest of these \u2014 in fact, it is the oldest church still in continuous use in the English-speaking world, having been established by Queen Bertha of Kent some time around 580 CE. She was a Christian princess from France who married the pagan King of Kent, and with her husband's permission took over and renovated an old Roman building in Canterbury which had fallen into disuse, and adopted it as her private chapel. When St Augustine arrived in England to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in 597, he took over this chapel as his headquarters, until a larger cathedral could be built nearby. King \u00c6thelberht of Kent was baptised in this church.  Artist's impression of St Martin's Church in Queen Bertha's day The church's chancel is the oldest part of the building, dating back to the Romans. The nave (the main part of the church) was built during the time of Bertha and Augustine circa 580-600. The east end of the church was extended in about 1200 to make the building larger, and a tower was added shortly before 1400 (one of the bells hanging in the tower has the date 1393 engraved on it).  Saxon stonework in the church's nave St Martin's remains an active Church of England parish church holding regular prayer services; although due to the coronavirus lockdown these are currently only held online, and the church itself is closed to all visitors.  Canterbury Cathedral is nearby, and part of the same UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was established by St Augustine in 597, and the historian Bede records that he originally dedicated an old Roman building for the purpose. A larger purpose-built church was constructed on the site some time around 900 CE, with a square central tower. This was badly damaged by a Viking raid in 1011, but rebuilt on a larger scale. Then in 1067, a year after the Norman Conquest, the cathedral burned down. The new Norman archbishop, Lanfranc, ordered it to be rebuilt in a French-influenced style; the work was completed in 1077. The cathedral was subsequently expanded and remodelled again in 1174, after the murder and subsequent canonisation of Archbishop Thomas Becket led to large numbers of pilgrims travelling to visit his grave. Another major rebuilding took place starting in 1396. The 72 metre tall crossing tower in the centre of the cathedral was constructed in 1433 onwards. After the Reformation the cathedral's attached monastery was closed down, but it continued to be the primary cathedral of the Church of England, now independent of Rome.  Canterbury Cathedral as it appeared circa 1900  Westminster Abbey was established by King Edward the Confessor near to his new palace, which he established in the 1040s just west of London. The church building was consecrated on 28 December 1065, shortly before the king's death. Nine days later on 6 January 1066 Harold Godwinson was the first of 38 English and British monarchs to be crowned in Westminster Abbey. (Henry III was initially crowned in Gloucester Cathedral instead, though four years later the ceremony was repeated in Westminster Abbey. Edward V was murdered before he could be crowned, and Edward VIII abdicated before he could be crowned.) Little survives of the original Anglo-Saxon abbey building. Westminster Abbey was completely rebuilt in the 13th century in the Gothic style, and re-consecrated in 1269.  Door in Westminster Abbey. The tree that provided the wood to make the door was cut down in the year 1032, give or take a couple of years. St Margaret's Church was founded during the 1100s in the grounds of Westminster Abbey, and owned by the abbey's monastic community, as a place of worship for local parishioners. It was rebuilt at the end of the 15th century and re-consecrated in 1523. It is noted as being the last surviving church in the London region to have been built before the Reformation. In 1616 Parliament began the practice of holding regular services for its members in this church, leading to it being nicknamed 'The parish church of the House of Commons'.  Durham Cathedral was constructed in the Norman style in 1093 onwards, on the site of an older Anglo-Saxon church which was demolished to make way for it. It was the seat of the Prince-Bishop of Durham who exercised quasi-royal authority in his region of northern England during the Middle Ages, with the responsibility to protect the realm against Scottish invasions.

            "answer_text": "We have thousands upon thousands of pre-Reformation churches. The oldest? St Martin's Canterbury dates from before St Augustine's arrival in 597 AD, and has Roman brickwork in the south nave wall. However its general appearance is medieval. For Anglo-Saxon churches, Escomb in Co Durham AD 675 is simple and stark. Very well preserved. St Thomas-on-the-Wall, Bradwell-juxta-Mare in the Essex marshes was built by St Cedd c.654 and is little altered. All Saints Brixworth in Northamptonshire was built c. 675 It was extended from the 10th century and later, but the original plan can still be seen. Then there are Anglo-Saxon towers like Earl's Barton in Northants and Barton-on-Humber in N. Lincs. Each architectural era has its own best examples. Southwell Minster, Notts, is an outstanding example of Norman design. For Early English, maybe Hexham Abbey. For Decorated, one of my favourites is Patrington, East Riding of Yorkshire, and many of the Lincolnshire fenland churches. For Perpendicular, how about King's College Cambridge? The cathedrals are the most impressive, York, Lincoln, Canterbury and Durham especially. They usually have parts from several different architectural periods. I couldn't imagine living in a country where the oldest buildings date only from 1610. ",
