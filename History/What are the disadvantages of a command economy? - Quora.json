            "answer_text": "The central disadvantage - it has no mechanisms to reallocate resources for better efficiency and is very prone to corruption. The problem with corruption off course - is again malinvestments and inefficiency. However, it can be very efficient at mobilizing resources for reaching specific well designed goals - like building bridges, roads, factories, buildings etc\u2026 It is just that the bridges and roads may lean to nowhere, the buildings will be made out of sand and factories will supply stuff without taking care there\u2019s corresponding demand.

            "answer_text": "Sounds like your homework assignment! The main disadvantage of a command economy is that the desires and needs of the population are extremely complex, and continually changing. A market economy does a much better job of satisfying these needs and desires.
