            "answer_text": "During the French revolution, the king of France was Louis XVI (23 August 1754 \u2013 21 January 1793). Thanks to his particular moves, French people started to feel more agitated toward him and monarchy. His policy of not raising taxes and taking out international loans (someone of them were used for funding the American Revolution) caused French international debt. By the mid 1780\u2019s, country was very close to bankruptcy which forced Louis XVI to enforce radical fiscal reforms which were not welcome with ordinary people.  Portrait of Louis XIV, king of France (23 August 1754 \u2013 21 January 1793)[1] His reign was associated with the outbreak of the French Revolution and end of French empire.
