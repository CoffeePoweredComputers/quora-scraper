            "answer_text": "It comes from what their infant grandchildren call them. It is an interesting fact that, as far as I know, every language on Earth has two words roughly in common. In every language, there is a term for mother that is some version of \u201cma\u201d. The reason for this is that \u201cma\u201d is the first syllable that a baby is able to say. The second is a tie between \u201cpa\u201d and \u201cba\u201d, so the word for father is some version of that (papa, baba, abba, etc). This is because a mother and father are highly involved in a baby's early life, obviously. If the grandparents are alive and live in the area, they tend to be involved as well, so the baby needs to call them something as well. The problem (in English at least) is that \u201cgrandmother\u201d and \u201cgrandfather\u201d, unlike \u201cmama\u201d and \u201cpapa\u201d, are not born out of ease on the infant tongue. Even the simplified \u201cgramma\u201d and \u201cgrampa\u201d start with a G-R consonant blend that is notoriously tricky to say, even at 3\u20134 years old. The result is that they get called some slight variation of mama and papa. Even if you call them Grandma and Grandpa, the baby will call them something adorable like moo-maw and pee-paw and everyone will think it's so sweet that the name will stick. That's how it happens. In my experience, there is no universal term for each grandparent, and every family has their own pet name. I teach preschool and many of my students don't really have the term Grandma or Grandpa in their vocabulary, except to describe other people's grandparents. This is a fairly common scenario: At dismissal, I see a student's mother standing next to an older woman, who is very excited to see the child (I'll call the kid Lucy). Me: \u201cLucy, is that your Grandma?\u201d Lucy: (giving me a ridiculous look as if I should definitely know better) \u201cNO! That's my Mee-Maw!\u201d Me: \u201cOh sorry. How ridiculously silly of me to make such a mistake.\u201d So that's its etymology. It's not from a linguistic root word, but from oral motor development that such words arise. ",
