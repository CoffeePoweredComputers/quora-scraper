            "answer_text": "I would not call it \u2018belying\u2019 or contradicting the actual, historical events - in many ways the film serves as good a cinematic attempt to account for the betrayal of the Arab peoples by British and French expansionists as any. The real Lawrence had no knowledge of the \u2018Sykes-Picot-Agreement\u2019 from 1916 when he was recruited as an agent for the foreign office. But it is hardly likely, that he assumed the restoration of Arab lands after defeating the Ottoman Empire would really take place, though there is no doubt he followed instructions to promise exactly that. So, yes, his role and main job as an English officer was to keep the Arabs fighting, to finally win their freedom from the Turks, only to lose it again to the British and French. But it becomes painfully clear when reading his own writings, that he suffered from bad conscience for the rest of his days, regarding the part he played in instigating this development. As for the historical accuracy, well, there are many details, actions and assignments of certain events to a particular time, that simply do not add up, and quite a few scenes are frankly preposterous. But that\u2019s called artistic freedom, and, in my opinion, does not impair the understanding of the wider, actual historical background. It is a movie about one man, first, and about colonial politics not even second - the latter simply provides the backdrop, and serves well, overall, to help characterize the inner conflict of a scientist turned soldier and agent, who chooses to believe in his own truth and ideals, knowing full well he will eventually fail.

            "answer_text": "There is an excellent book called Lawrence in Arabia and it deals with the historical actions and wheeling and dealing that took place. The movie Lawrence in Arabia, is by and large based upon fact. Its also a fantastic movie. What is not shown or talked about much was the first couple of years before Lawrence was in the field with the Bedouin. As well it doesnt say that Lawrence actually found out about the Skykes Picot deal shortly after it was agreed and he did everything to help the Arabs so that they could actually have their own countries. He obviously wasnt success full and after lobbying during the peace treaty negotiations, when the world was being carved up, he ultimately gave up. So the myth about Lawrence as a man isnt a myth. He was a brilliant man with an amazing mind and a brutal ability for amazing acts of endurance. But at the end of the day he was a warrior and not a politician. The last speach in the movie hints at that when Faisal says good by to Lawrence. ",

            "answer_text": "The film was more accurate than most films dealing with historical events. After all, its a movie! Its goal is entertainment, not education.\u201cLawrence\u201d is morer accurate than most. Yes, the British did not consider opposing Turkey in the Arabian Peninsula. It was Lawrence\u2019s doing. That did not stop Britain and France from dividing the area through League \u201cMandates\u201d, on the grounds that they were not capable of self-government yet. Eventually they all became independent for better or worse. ",

I\u2019m not sure how true the movie is to the book, but Lawrence himself seemed to me egocentric and had an exaggerated opinion of his own importance. I doubt if either the book or movie could be called considered historically accurate. ",
