            "answer_text": "The primarily thing that it did was to bankrupt the government. France intervened heavily in the war, and that cost a great deal of money. Louis XVI raised taxes after the war to try to cover France\u2019s enormous debt, and this infuriated the population, leading to civil unrest. I\u2019d add that culturally, it also cemented one of the strongest international alliances between modern major nations of all time and an extraordinary cultural affinity between the two nations. The United States was founded on principles that were largely based on French enlightenment thinking, particularly Rousseau and Montaigne, and some of the greatest thinkers from among the \u201cfounding fathers\u201d were avid francophiles (Remember that both Jefferson and Franklin were ambassadors to France). The American revolution helped to inspire the French revolution, which unfortunately quickly spiralled into chaos. ",

            "answer_text": " Kevin Dolgin has the correct answer. However, he didn\u2019t mention the war France started with two allies, the Netherlands and Spain, against Great Britain. The idea was to create a second front in North America to draw British resources from the European war. So first create that second front and if successful, go to war against the British. It was very costly and one that France couldn\u2019t recover\u2026. \u201c\u2026. let them eat cake.\u201d This is a quote from Wikipedia on the issue. I added East and West Florida and clarification on the name of states rather than US. Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783) - Wikipedia \u201c A Franco-American army led by the Comte de Rochambeau and Washington then besieged Cornwallis' army and, with no sign of relief, he surrendered in October 1781. Whigs in Britain had long opposed the pro-war Tories in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in America, but the war continued overseas. Britain remained under siege in Gibraltar but scored a major victory over the French navy. On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the Treaty of Paris in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States (States by name but not a country called The United States) and formally end the war. French involvement had proven decisive, but France made few gains and incurred crippling debts. Spain made some territorial gains (East and West Florida went back to Spain) but failed in its primary aim of recovering Gibraltar. The Dutch were defeated on all counts and were compelled to cede territory to Great Britain. In India, the war against Mysore and its allies concluded in 1784 without any territorial changes.\u201d Further, of interest is the comment, \u201cWhigs in Britain had long opposed the pro-war Tories\u2026..\u201d The war is the American War of Independence. Pit the Elder, a parliamentarian Whigs (LIberals in nature) MP and party leader, supported the Americans. His son, Pit the Younger, shortly became Prime Minister in 1783. Had the Patriots not gone to war, every objection the founding fathers had would have been addressed and no war needed. The United States and Canada would have been one country. ",

            "answer_text": "Badly. After helping the United States beat the British, France basically went bankrupt. They had used up a ton of money and resources to pay for the war, and now they had not enough to feed their people. That is what basically led to the French Revolution. (Well, that and the greedy king and queen.) ",
