            "answer_text": "If France had not sold Louisiana to the United States in 1803, it would have shortly lost the territory. There's no reason to think that the retention of Louisiana would have done anything to avert the collapse of the year-long Anglo-French peace inaugurated by the 1802 Treaty of Amiens. A France that was determined to become a global power directly competing with Britain in North America as well as in Europe might easily have triggered an earlier resumption of war. It was far too late for France to become a major North American power, forty years after the collapse of New France and twenty after the emergence of the expansionist United States. The only question was whether Louisiana would pass to the United States or to the United Kingdom. It was Napoleon's genius to sell the territory to the United States, the country that was a strong rival to Britain and the less likely of the two to pose a threat to French interests. ",

            "answer_text": "Likely an eventual war between France and the US. America was hungry for land in North Anerica from 1763 to 1914, and they fought for whatever could not be bought. The Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American Wars, the Oregon and Alaska border dispute, and the purchase of Alaska all demonstrate this voracious appetite for lands.  The territory is vast and rich, but France would have had to resupply via New Orleans or perhaps the St Lawrence/Canada, while the US shared an entire boarder with the territory. I have a hard time envisioning La R\u00e9publique putting up much of a resistance this time around, especially because French-Native alliances had ended forty years hence, and were always most active east of the Mississippi.
