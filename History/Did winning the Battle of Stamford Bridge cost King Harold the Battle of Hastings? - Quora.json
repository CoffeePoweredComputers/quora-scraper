            "answer_text": "In January 1066, the King of England Edward the Confessor died without having left an heir to the throne. This empty succession caused Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex, Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, and William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, to claim their rights to the throne. The day after Edward the Confessor died, Harold Godwinson proclaimed himself King of England. His army consisted of an elite troop, the hird of the so-called huscarles, and a large number of common soldiers of the militia cam called fyrd. Harold, waiting for the attack of William, Duke of Normandy, then called William the Conqueror, sent all his troops to defend the south coast of England, assuming that the attack would come through the English Channel. But Guillermo did not attack, and on September 8 he ran out of food and capital, so he had to send his troops back to London.  Scene of the battle according to an engraving of the thirteenth century. Harold Hardrada decided to take advantage of the situation and attack Yorkshire, in the north of England. A brother of Harold, Tostig, joined the Vikings. Godwinson was not worried. When he heard about the future attack he said about Harald: \"I will give him six feet of English soil, and since he is so tall one more\". This episode is evoked by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges in \"The Shame of History\", story contained in the work \u00abOther Inquisitions\u00bb, 1952. Godwinson gathered his army and marched 200 miles, from London to York, in just five days. His plan was to ambush Harald, since Harald did not expect the attack or have protection. The Saxon army was approaching Hardrada's camp, on the other side of the Derwent River, at Stamford Bridge. Harald spotted the enemy troops and sent a contingent of his army to fight them, while he and the rest of his soldiers had time to line up.  Before beginning the battle, Harald said the following sentence: In battle we should never hide behind a shield ... My armor tells me: Hold your head up, where sword meets skull.5 Which in Spanish means: In battle we should never hide behind the shields ... My armor tells me: Lift up your head, where the sword finds the skull. Godwinson's troops easily defeated those sent by Hardrada; Harald's plan had failed. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the eponymous bridge of the town was defended by a huge and tall Norwegian berserker that dwarfed Harald Hardrada himself (who measured more than two meters), armed with an ax and without any armor. It terrorized the Anglo-Saxon army and protected the bridge for an hour, killing anyone who tried to cross it (40 Anglo-Saxons were its victims). A Saxon soldier found an old log on the river bed with which he managed to cross the river and kill the berserker with his spear, after which the army of Harold Godwinson could cross the bridge. This situation allowed to prepare the army of Hardrada. They formed in phalanx with a strong line of shields (fylking), that the Anglo-Saxons were not able to cross.  After a brief truce, Godwinson made a new charge. But this time the huscarles did not enter combat. Only the fyrd advanced, and after a short fight they fled. Hardrada thought he had won, broke ranks, and pounced on the Saxons. But the fyrd turned around and, along with the huscarles who had stayed with Harold, surrounded the Vikings. Hardrada had fallen into the trap. There was a fierce battle where Harald died from a crush in the throat. A companion asked him if he was badly wounded and the Viking king replied: \"It's just a small arrow, but it's doing its job.\" Harald Hardrada died and the Vikings were defeated.  The news that William had landed reached Harold's ears on October 1, amidst the celebrations that followed Stamford Bridge. He hurried south, gathering the fyrd and other soldiers on the way back to London. He left the capital on October 11 in the direction of the south with an army of 6,000 to 7,000 troops. On the afternoon of October 31, Harold reached the hill of Senlac, a place he had chosen as a possible battlefield. As the Saxons had reached the end of the day, they would choose to rest and then launch a lightning attack in the morning. However, Guillermo himself was going to make the first move. He picked up his men shortly before five in the morning, and by 06:00 the Normans were marching north to face Harold's army. Before leaving, Willam harangued them saying: \"You do not fight only for victory, but also for survival\". Willam divided his army into three divisions, which marched with the Bretons in the vanguard, followed by the Franco-Flemish soldiers and, finally, Guillermo at the head of his own Normans. The meeting point was Blackhorse Hill, on the road from Hastings to London, where the Bretons arrived at 07:30. There, hidden from the Saxons, Guillermo left his train of baggage and ordered his men to put on their mail armor. Willam put his armor upside down, which was considered by his superstitious men as a bad omen, that the cynical Guillermo just laughed. The Norman army marched north, to take up positions against the Saxons.  Map of Battle of Hastings On October 14 at age 44, Harold was confronted with Guillermo, 38 years old. Both were experienced and talented commanders, and the leading armies of Western Europe were at the forefront: the Normans, for the prospects of conquest and loot; the Saxons, for the need to defend their homeland and for their recent victory at Stamford Bridge. It was the first time that an army mainly formed by cavalry fought against the infantry in this way. The result would decide the nature of the medieval war onwards. A loud trumpet at 09:00 announced the beginning of the battle, when the three divisions of Willam began to climb the slope of the hill of Senlac. The archers in front threw a cloud of arrows over the Saxons, with little effect. The Saxon response with javelins, spears and axes proved to be much more effective against the advance of the Normans. As they had the gentlest slope, the restless Bretons were the first to crash into the wall of shields and were repulsed by the fierce resistance of the Saxons. Disconcerted by this and by the inability of the archers to make a dent in the wall of shields, the Bretons withdrew towards 10:00 - 10:30. The retreat turned into a rout when the undisciplined fyrd militia left the safety of the shield wall to pursue the fleeing Bretons.  Willam gathered a part of the Norman cavalry, which was advancing, to help the Bretons. He threw a load of armored horsemen against the fyrd, taking the Saxons by surprise, who were less armored and in the open field, were annihilated. Guillermo withdrew his other two divisions, and stopped for half an hour, to regroup and launch another attack. Willam, taking personally the command, started the second attack at 11:00. Wave attacks were launched against the shield wall for two hours. The Normans managed to open a few gaps; however, Harold and his commanders, including his brothers Gyrth (Earl of East Anglia) and Leofwine (Earl of Kent), plugged the gaps and threw a hail of projectiles upon the enemy. Harold's banner and the Wessex dragon banner were placed in the center of the Saxon lines to stimulate the defenders.  Around 1:00 p.m. Flemish and French soldiers began to flee the hill. His commander, Eustaquio, grabbed the papal banner, regrouped his fleeing men and ordered them to return to the fight. Guillermo had already lost his Spanish steed and was fighting on foot when he heard the rumor that he had died. Eustace gave the duke a horse to ride and show himself to his men. Guillermo ripped off his helmet so that his soldiers could recognize him and shouted: Look at me well. I am still alive and by the grace of God I will still be the winner! If the Saxons had defended their line indefinitely, he would have been forced to retreat back to Hastings and return across the channel. At 2:00 PM Willam called his men and they regrouped under the hill to rest and feed their hungry soldiers. Harold used this truce to shorten his thin line. Having lost a quarter of his army, some 1,800 - 1,900 men and in five hours of almost continuous combat, as well as a tremendous number of horses, Willam saw that many of his armed horsemen were now fighting on their feet. He decided that the entire army would attack in a single formation of all the combined weapons.  The third and last attack contemplated the advance of the entire army, with the archers in the rear, from 3:00 pm, at a slow pace. The Normans took half an hour to reach the Saxon line. Guillermo had ordered the archers to shoot as high as possible while the infantry, the dismounted horsemen and the still mounted cavalry devoted all their effort to attack the shield wall. Once a breach in the wall was created, the Norman cavalry penetrated in torrents and, with their pikes, swords and spears, tore the most defenseless part of the Saxon army. After 4:00 pm the breach became irrepressible and the fight degenerated into group actions and melee combat. This fight continued until 5:30 p.m. Then the fyrd began to retreat and fled into the woods, while the huscarles continued to fight until they were crushed and killed. A large group concentrated around Harold's banner, while William joined his men on the hill and his third and last horse died under him. Harold captained his men, giving personal example to their huscarles. However, they were not enough to reject the Normans. Gyrth and Leofwin, at the head of their own huscarles, were killed.  Bayeux Tapestry - Scene 57: the death of King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. Titulus: HIC HAROLD REX INTERFECTUS EST (Here King Harold is slain) The last straw was the death of Harold himself. He was shot down by the Normans while directing his last huscarles. At dusk, small groups of Saxons kept fighting until they could sneak into the surrounding fields. They regrouped and ambushed their Norman pursuers at Oakwood Gili, a small stream north of Senlac Hill, and succeeded in bringing down Eustace of Bologna. It was a small consolation for Harold's death. Both sides had lost more than 2,000 men, and the Normans more than a third of their army. For William, it was a triumph against all odds that led him to be crowned King of England on December 25, 1066. The Saxons would continue to resist their Norman invader for decades after their defeat at the Battle of Hastings, but were ultimately defeated .

            "answer_text": "Did winning the Battle of Stamford Bridge cost King Harold the Battle of Hastings! That would certainly be my opinion after reading Battle of Stamford Bridge - Wikipedia. It was a brutal battle which King Harold won, but it would be impossible to win another huge battle just three days afterwards. Battle of Stamford BridgeSeptember 25, 1066Battle of HastingsSeptember 28, 1066The first battle was fought by the King Harald Hardrada of Norway who had joined forces with King Harold Godwinson\u2019s exiled brother Tostig Godwinson: The death of King Edward the Confessor of England in January 1066 had triggered a succession struggle in which a variety of contenders from across north-western Europe fought for the English throne. These claimants included the King of Norway, Harald Hardrada. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Manuscript D (p. 197), [3] the Norwegians assembled a fleet of 300 ships to invade England. The authors, however, did not seem to differentiate between warships and supply ships. In King Harald's Saga, Snorri Sturluson states, \"... it is said that King Harald had over two hundred ships, apart from supply ships and smaller craft.\" [4] Combined with reinforcements picked up in Orkney, the Norwegian army most likely numbered between 7,000 and 9,000 men. Arriving off the English coast in September Hardrada was joined by further forces recruited in Flanders and Scotland by Tostig Godwinson. [5] Tostig was at odds with his elder brother Harold (who had been elected king by the Witenagemot on the death of Edward). Having been ousted from his position as Earl of Northumbria and exiled in 1065, Tostig had mounted a series of abortive attacks on England in the spring of 1066. [6] In the late summer of 1066, the invaders sailed up the Ouse before advancing on York. On 20 September they defeated a northern English army led by Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and his brother Morcar, Earl of Northumbria, at the Battle of Fulford, outside York. Following this victory they received the surrender of York. Having briefly occupied the city and taken hostages and supplies from the city they returned towards their ships at Riccall. They offered peace to the Northumbrians in exchange for their support for Hardrada's bid for the throne, and demanded further hostages from the whole of Yorkshire. [7] King Harold was in the South preparing for an anticipated Norman invasion by William, Duke of Normandy and so immediately responded to the threat posed by the King of Norway and his brother, taking them completely by surprise: At this time King Harold was in Southern England, anticipating an invasion from France by William, Duke of Normandy, another contender for the English throne. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he headed north at great speed with his huscarls and as many thegns as he could gather, travelling day and night. He made the journey from London to Yorkshire, a distance of about 185 miles (298 km), in only four days, enabling him to take the Norwegians completely by surprise. Having learned that the Northumbrians had been ordered to send the additional hostages and supplies to the Norwegians at Stamford Bridge, Harold hurried on through York to attack them at this rendezvous on 25 September. [8] Until the English army came into view the invaders remained unaware of the presence of a hostile army anywhere in the vicinity. Regarding the battle itself, we read: Battle  Battle of Stamford Bridge by Peter Nicolai Arbo. According to Snorri Sturluson, before the battle a single man rode up alone to Harald Hardrada and Tostig. He gave no name, but spoke to Tostig, offering the return of his earldom if he would turn against Hardrada. Tostig asked what his brother Harold would be willing to give Hardrada for his trouble. The rider replied \"Seven feet of English ground, as he is taller than other men.\" Then he rode back to the Saxon host. Hardrada was impressed by the rider's boldness, and asked Tostig who he was. Tostig replied that the rider was Harold Godwinson himself. [12] According to Henry of Huntingdon, Harold said \"Six feet of ground or as much more as he needs, as he is taller than most men.\" The exact location of the Stamford Bridge battlefield is not known. Local tradition places the battlefield east of the River Derwent and just southeast of the town in an area known as Battle Flats. The location of the Norwegian army at the start of the battle is not known for certain. Accounts of their location differ, depending on sources and interpretations. A common view is that the Norwegian army was divided in two; with some of their troops on the west side of the River Derwent and the bulk of their army on the east side. Another interpretation is that they were just leaving Stamford Bridge and moving along the old Roman road toward York (west side of the River Derwent). [13] [unreliable source?] The sudden appearance of the English army caught the Norwegians by surprise. [14]. Their response was to deploy rapidly in a defensive circle. [citation needed] If the Norwegians were located at Battle Flats, there is no good explanation as to why they deployed into this formation. However, if they were located on the east side of the Derwent, the deployment made perfect sense. By the time the bulk of the English army had arrived, the Vikings on the west side were either slain or fleeing across the bridge. The English advance was then delayed by the need to pass through the choke-point presented by the bridge itself. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has it that a giant Norse axeman (possibly armed with a Dane Axe) blocked the narrow crossing and single-handedly held up the entire English army. The story is that this axeman cut down up to 40 Englishmen and was defeated only when an English soldier floated under the bridge in a half-barrel and thrust his spear through the planks in the bridge, mortally wounding the axeman. [15] This delay had allowed the bulk of the Norse army to form a shieldwall to face the English attack. Harold's army poured across the bridge, forming a line just short of the Norse army, locked shields and charged. The battle went far beyond the bridge itself, and although it raged for hours, the Norse army's decision to leave their armour behind left them at a distinct disadvantage. Eventually, the Norse army began to fragment and fracture, allowing the English troops to force their way in and break up the Scandinavians' shield wall. Completely outflanked, and with Hardrada killed with an arrow to his windpipe and Tostig slain, the Norwegian army disintegrated and was virtually annihilated.[16] In the later stages of the battle, the Norwegians were reinforced by troops who had been guarding the ships at Riccall, led by Eystein Orre, Hardrada's prospective son-in-law. Some of his men were said to have collapsed and died of exhaustion upon reaching the battlefield. The remainder were fully armed for battle. Their counter-attack, described in the Norwegian tradition as \"Orre's Storm\", briefly checked the English advance, but was soon overwhelmed and Orre was slain. The Norwegian army were routed. As given in the Chronicles, pursued by the English army, some of the fleeing Norsemen drowned whilst crossing rivers. [1] So many died in an area so small that the field was said to have been still whitened with bleached bones 50 years after the battle. [17] [18] This was a huge battle to have to fight while waiting and anticipating the Norman invasion. King Harold Godwinson was not able to fight two epic battles in such a short time. He had the strength to delay the outcome about two weeks, but could not overcome The Duke of Normandy and his forces in the aftermath of the Battle of Stamford Bridge: Aftermath  A 19th-century illustration of the Harald Hardrada saga, Heimskringla. King Harold accepted a truce with the surviving Norwegians, including Harald's son Olaf and Paul Thorfinnsson, Earl of Orkney. They were allowed to leave after giving pledges not to attack England again. The losses the Norwegians had suffered were so severe that only 24 ships from the fleet of over 300 were needed to carry the survivors away. [1] They withdrew to Orkney, where they spent the winter, and in the spring Olaf returned to Norway. The kingdom was then divided and shared between him and his brother Magnus, whom Harald had left behind to govern in his absence. [19] Harold's victory was short-lived. Three days after the battle, on 28 September, a second invasion army led by William, Duke of Normandy, landed in Pevensey Bay, Sussex, on the south coast of England. Harold had to immediately turn his troops around and force-march them southwards to intercept the Norman army. Less than three weeks after Stamford Bridge, on 14 October 1066, the English army was decisively defeated and King Harold II fell in action at the Battle of Hastings, beginning the Norman conquest of England, a process facilitated by the heavy losses amongst the English military commanders. Conclusion: Winning the Battle of Stanford Bridge did cost King Harold Godwinson. But it was a battle he had to win. If he had not won, it would have been his brother, Tostig, and the Norwegians led by King Hardrada that would of faced The Duke of Normandy and his army. William would still have won the Battle of Hastings, give or take a few days. Thank you for the A2A, Christopher Meade! ",

They also lost a large number of the Select Fyrd, so many, in fact, that there were no Northern levies at Hastings. Numbers matter \u2014- particularly in reference to elite troops such as the Housecarls. If these troops had been present at Hastings, there is a very good possibility they would have had a significant impact. Of course, there are other issues specific to the Battle of Hastings itself that played a significant role. ",
