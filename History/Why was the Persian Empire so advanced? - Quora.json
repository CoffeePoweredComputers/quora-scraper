            "answer_text": "It wasn\u2019t. Assuming that by \u201cempire\u201d you mean pre-Islamic Iran, then at no point during antiquity were the Persians (or Medes, or Parthians, the other members of the Iranian nation) considered to be at the fore-front of civilization or advanced especially. That respect for Persians as paragons of civilization was shared by the Arabs and Turks, the newcomers who took Iran as their role-model, and only flourished in the Islamic period. The Medes - who were the original bearers of Zoroastrianism - and had built their \u201cempire\u201d only a couple generations before Cyrus made them the first of his conquests, already looked down on the Persians, much as Iranians would look down on Turks in the middle-ages. Courtesy of Cartoon History of the Universe:  And that was only in the 6th c. BC - the history of settled states in the East goes back to the third millenium BC! The Assyrians (in Northern Iraq, still present as a tiny Christian minority) - who established the paradigm of empire followed by both Medes and Persians (whose empires used a Semitic lingua franca, Aramaic - which would be the \u201clanguage of Jesus\u201d in another time period) were themselves merely the \u201cyoungest\u201d of the great empires on the lands of the Fertile Crescent, if the mightiest yet. Before them was of course Babylon \u201cthe great\u201d, the city with the most enduring influence and inheritance to posterity, near later Ctesiphon and Baghdad. But Babylon was itself old - and its \u2018classical period\u2019 as an empire, as well as likely the first state-structure outside the old city-states, was set up not by Babylonians but by the \u2018barbarian\u2019 Kassites, who had descended from the (now Kurdish) mountains to rule their empire centuries before the Assyrians. And even further back, before Babylon was a glimmer in some king\u2019s eye, the lands between the rivers were the domain of the Akkadians, the first Semitic empire, who in turn had slowly displaced the \u201cold inhabitants\u201d, the Sumerians. Under Akkad, Sumerian was itself the prestige language of a more advanced civilization, and was like Latin or classical Arabic known to the elite and the priesthood - a characteristic ritual of the time involving the same prayer in Akkadian and Sumerian in each of the ears of a sacred bull.  The Persians produced conquerors, kings and lawmakers \u2014\u201cCyrus was a father, Cambyses a master, and Darius a shopkeeper\u201d, they used to say of the Achaemenid dynasty \u2014 but they were never at the economic or cultural heart of the empire. Indeed, the great tolerance of Cyrus betrays a nation not overtly obsessed with its own religion or culture (these always make the best empires in their youth - think of the Americans) and still in awe of the senior civilizations it has subdued. Even as late as Yazdgerd III, who lost his kingship to the Arabs, the Persians or Iranians in general weren\u2019t the majority in their own capital \u2014 and though the Arabs learned statemanship and bureaucracy from the Persians, the sciences and literary arts they learnt from the Assyrians (who would, with time, become \u201cIraqis\u201d). Just like men, no nation is an island. From his inheritance of the petty kingdom of Anshan in Fars, Cyrus became\u2026 The Great King, King of Persia, King of Anshan, King of Media, King of Babylon, King of Sumer and Akkad, and King of the Four Corners of the World ..a fearsome title, and one which you\u2019ll notice is dominated by many, many realms which for contemporary princes would have added to the lustre of Cyrus\u2019 name much more than any flat reference to Persia would have had. We are building the ruins of the future. The gods of the past have become the demons of today, and the barbarians of the present will be the civilizers of tomorrow. ",

            "answer_text": "Three words\u2026Cyrus the Great. Cyrus was unique among most kings of antiquity as he spent his early years living as a commoner, unaware of his royal heritage. This gave him a sense of empathy and tolerance for his fellow man unlike virtually any other King that had come before him. And living as a commoner also forced him to live by his wits as everything he achieved up until his true identity was revealed he achieved through his own wits and intelligence. When Cyrus defeated the Medes his kingdom gained all the knowledge that their Magi possessed. He gained extensive knowledge of the advanced battle techniques, particularly regarding siege warfare, that were taken from the Assyrians. It was also the Assyrians under Sennacherib that most likely created one of the greatest engineering achievements of the ancient world, the \u201changing gardens of Babylon\u201d. Cyrus\u2019s empire gained that knowledge too. Later, he conquered Babylon and Lydia, gaining all of their wealth and knowledge which was also extensive. When he took over the Greek colonies on the outskirts of Lydia he also took over the homeland of some of the most famous Greek scholars, philosophers and scientists of the day as well. Because of his tolerance, Cyrus allowed these scholars to continue their scientific, engineering, and philosophical research. He also likely gained access to much of the knowledge that the Judeans possessed through the prophet Daniel after he freed them from their captivity in Babylon. And all this made the Persian Empire even more advanced and powerful. I have a theory that Cyrus was even trying to open up the \u201cSilk Road\u201d to the East centuries before it actually happened. This is why he tried to take over the Massagetae territory, which eventually led to his death. But if he had been successful the flood of knowledge that would have swept through the Persian Empire would likely have been like none in history, before or since. When Cambyses II conquered Egypt after Cyrus\u2019s death, this opened up all the knowledge of Egypt to Persia. Darius the Great even likely allowed the Greek philosopher/scientist, Pythagoras, to accompany the great ancient explorer, Skylax, to explore India and other parts of the East and bring back their knowledge. In fact, so much knowledge poured into the Empire from foreign lands that this is likely what led to the schism between the Persian magi that produced the Persian civil war that nearly brought down the Persian Empire after the death of Cambyses II. It was simply too much for the Magian priests brought up in the old ways and they revolted. So Persia was so advanced because, without prejudice, they simply absorbed all of the knowledge that they gained from all the territories and nation states that they conquered and put that knowledge to productive use. And this was all because of the policy of tolerance towards other people that Cyrus instituted from the beginning of his reign, and which continued to be a state policy through the reign of Darius the Great.
