            "answer_text": " USSR was the most Brutal and Ruthless people i heard true stories that Communists would detain a person just because he had a beard take him to Pulecharkhi Prison and kill him by firing squad , if they had found religious books in your house you would be dead . my mother said that the USSR emptied a whole magazine in the mouth of our neighbors father he wasn\u2019t Mujahidin but because he had beard and looked religious .  do you know what happened to this innocent kid ? he lost his limbs as a result of USSR Butterfly Mines which they threw millions of them from Aircraft into villages and mountains it\u2019s not just this kid but there are thousands like him which up to this day suffers from the brutality of USSR and their puppet Afghan Communist Regime.  there are documentaries on youtube in which the USSR Bombs Villages and cities without thinking there are civilians in their , massacring everyone , imagine 2 Million people died isn\u2019t that Genocide? but the bottom line is that Afghan Mujahidin defeated them and at the end they escaped with their tails between their legs with their Spetnaz and other Elite Commandos they learned a good listen , you can\u2019t win by force and your military might, Afghanistan is a graveyard of empires. there are many failed Military Operations carried out by USSR and their Afghan Puppet forces that Miserably failed and they suffered heavy losses , we learn from that don\u2019t be afraid of enemy no matter how powerful they are just rely on Allah and strike them with whatever you have and leave the rest to Allah (The one and only God) who would have thought that Normal Afghan fighters will defeat the most powerful country in the world?

            "answer_text": "Unlike USA, USSR brought to Afghanistan women rights, built schools and hospitals and promoted Afghani culture. USSR welcomed Afghanis to come to USSR and study in the best schools - a lot of leadership of the Northern Alliance of today are the graduates of such schools, their studying together and returning back had brought the feuding clans together and made that alliance possible to begin with. If not for American interference (as usual), Afghanistan would have been a much better place today, completely self-sufficient. And no - there was no \u201cgenocide\u201d or targeting of innocent villages - that\u2019s a typical American propaganda. ",

There may have been a baias against the USSR\u2019s invasion, but no one even hinted at the notion of genocide in news reports. I don\u2019t know where you get the idea that this ever happened from.

            "answer_text": "Afghanistan had existed as a neutral country. It sacrificed its prosperity not accepting aid at the cost of its neutrality under the last monarch. Sardar Daud had started its disintegration as a respected free nation by his showy revolution of declaring it a republic. Rashid Taraki added fuel to fire. Soviet invasion started on destructive path, that led to a disaster both for Afghanistan and USSR. ",
