            "answer_text": "There are two reasons. First, they had suffered not one but two major disasters trying to invade Japan. The first in 1274 saw over 22 500 of the almost 30 000 perish in a typhoon. Most of the survivors were the Korean crewmen who abandoned their ships when they saw the storm coming. So, a second larger invasion force was prepared for by 1281. This invasion would have over 4500 ships and approximately 140 000 soldiers and ship\u2019s crew. 40 000 Mongols and 900 ships departed from Korea itself and the rest departed from southern China. Because the Japanese had erected a wall all along the beach at Hakata Bay, the Mongols could not land or get a foothold there. They sailed to Shika Island, just off the Bay. After a surprise attack by the Japanese that saw 2000 Mongols beheaded and their head mounted on spikes, the Mongols moved down the coast to Tasashima in Imari Bay. They fought here for two months with the Mongols not really getting a good foothold in Japan. Then another typhoon hit. The fleet tried to move out to deeper water to ride out the typhoon but didn\u2019t make it in time. The nature of the fleet also contributed to its destruction. The haste in constructing the invasion fleet meant that the ships had to be hastily built with structural flaws and weaknesses. To make up numbers, flat-bottomed boats were used as well. These boats easily floundered in rough seas. Only some 10 000 Koreans survived because they were on older sturdier ships. Many of the Mongols who survived were later beheaded by the Japanese. In the end, it was the worst naval disaster of all time with over 130 000 lost. A third invasion was called for by Kublai Khan but he cancelled it two years later. The other reason is that the Mongols were masters of the battlefield in their element, the Steppe or similar terrain. They were totally out of their element in tropical climates, rough terrain or sea-borne invasions. In these circumstances, they met with total failure. It wasn\u2019t just Japan they failed against, but also Java, Vietnam, Burma and Syria. In each of these areas, they came up against enemies in terrain that was ill-suited to the Mongol style of warfare. ",

            "answer_text": "One word: Logistics. the reason the first attempt failed was of course a typhoon but that is not the whole story. The Chinese ocean-going vessels mostly survived the typhoon due to their deeper keel. That is how many Mongol survivors made it home. That covers part of the invading Armada. The sad story though is that the Mongols needed many more vessels to support their invasion attempt. They had no alternative than to requisition riverine vessels to pad up the numbers. These were flat-bottom junks, not typhoon-rated. These went to the bottom in large numbers leaving no option than to return home. The result was that Chinese riverine commerce was crippled for years to come. They had to be rebuilt. So had some of the ocean-going vessels. This was going to be a huge undertaking requiring large resources \u2026 and time. Not to memtion that sailors and soldiers needed replacing as well. By sailors I mean ocean-capable experience sailors. Handling a riverine flat bottom junk requires white water sailing skills. Going Blue water sailing (open ocean) represents a different challenge. Of course it could all have been done. What was needed was a Master Plan and a Master. That Master would have had to dictate a single goal: invade Japan. Then all resources and manpower would have to be diverted to that entreprise for many years to come for an uncertain results: there was much to be feared in a second attempt. Perhaps there were easier targets - and greater rewards - to be had at less risks and costs? Meanwhile the Master would have to remain in control all that time and 'convince' all to follow him in a dangerous undertaking, immediately following the previous disastrous campaign. I can hear the grumbling through the time-space continuum. Warriors will follow a successful leader to the very gates of hell. First, you must be successful \u2026 and avoid disasters. Thus you may appear to be blessed by the gods and worthy of our support. Fail and the gods have turned their backs on you. Time for new - and hopefully blessed - leadership. Time to draw attention to other targets to tecoup much needed prestige and to take minds off recent events. That recipe is timeless. ",
