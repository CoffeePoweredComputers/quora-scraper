            "answer_text": "There were no Muslims before Islam, because, you see, Muslims are the followers of the Islamic faith. However, Christianity is very similiar to Islam, even Judaism in some ways because these are the Abrahamic religions. Many Muslim Islamic scholars will say that the people who were Christian before Islam and the people who were Jewish before Christianity were following God\u2019s true religion. Muslims believe that the reason why God sent down newer religions is because people kept on changing the religion, namely, the holy books Torah and the Bible. These books are believed to have been God\u2019s words in the beginning, but people changed it with their own words, and that is why God sent down one last book- the Qur\u2019an, and said nobody will be able to change it. And that's why some verses in the Qur\u2019an cause much controversy, because they're clearly outdated but \u2018true\u2019 Muslims (one\u2019s who try to follow the Qur\u2019an) aren't allowed to change it or remove it. But in reality, most Muslims do not follow these verses in their lives, even if they think they do. They just say you cannot change God\u2019s words to suit your lifestyle if the topic comes up. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean Muslims or do you mean Arabs? Because as far as Islam is concerned the Muslims before Muhammad were people like Jesus, Abraham, etc. Islam means submission and a Muslim is simply one who submits to God which ideally we all should do. Islam in this sense, is certainly not something created in 609 A.D. But I\u2019m presuming what you really mean is Arabs. Most of them were polytheists although, Christianity and Judaism were both present in Arabia and there seem to have been some Arabs, called Hanifs, who believed in the Biblical prophets without considering themselves members of either religion. It would also seem that Arabs in general were familiar with biblical tales because often times the Qur\u2019an only seems to tell half the story as though it presumes its audience already knows the other half. But most Arabs had a religion not dissimilar to that of ancient Mesopotamia. In fact, Allah was conceived of as having three daughters just like the Marduk, the high god of Babylon. The Qur\u2019anic verse \u201cGod does not begat nor is He begotten\u201d was a condemnation of this belief before it was applied to the Christian belief in the Trinity. Like the Mesopotamians they had no real belief in an afterlife nor was there much of a moral quality to their religion. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are asking what religion the Arabs in Mecca and elsewhere in Arabia followed well there were quite a few. The core Quraish, and a few more tribes which were powerful were polytheists and The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born into one of these tribes. Their main deities were Lata Uzza & Mannat,who were supposed to be their main Supreme God Allah's daughters. They made up a hierarchy in their worship and recognised Allah but they saw him as too powerful to respond to them so they worshipped the lesser gods like these and the angels and jinn or spirits.   Then there were other Arabs who were basically monotheistic and they believed in One God, the God of Abraham through whom they believed they descended. The Prophet was a monotheist since before he got the message from God and he was always disturbed by the corruption of the pilgrimage practices and all by the Quraish and also the mindless corruption in daily life. There were many Jews and Christian's amongst the Arabs and in fact a Jewish wise man was the first to tell that the Prophet is the promised Messiah mentioned in their holy texts. So yeah basically Arabia had all these people worshipping in different ways before the Advent of Islam. God Spede ",

For example the Prophet Muhammad's coming was predicted in the Bible (supposedly). So we have (supposedly) been following the same God since the first man on this Earth, which we believe is Adam.
