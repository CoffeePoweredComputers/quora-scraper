            "answer_text": " The Battle of Haldighati was a battle fought on 18 June 1576.between cavalry and archers supporting the Rana of Mewar, Maharana Pratap; and the Mughal emperor Akbar's forces, led by Man Singh I of Amber. To understand the reason why it led to this battle we will need some backstory. The Mughals had lost a lot a fertile ground during and after them Siege of Chittorgarh in 1568. To combat the loss of territory the Mughal leader wanted to secure a safe trade route to Gujarat. This route cut right through Mewar, therefore the Mughal leader needed the permission of the Rana (king) of that region. The Mughal leader sent a convoy to ask for the Rana\u2019s permission to use his region as a vassal for his trade route. When the Rana refused to personally submit to Akbar, war became inevitable. It led to a bloody war which was won by the Mughals.

The Army under Man Singh was ultimately making its way to Gogunda and then to other places. Haldighati is a bottleneck where the Maharana knew he had the advantage. He, however pre-poned the attack when he realised that cannons were being brought up to ford the stream at the entrance of the pass. Once cannons succeeded in crossing, Pratap would be at a big disadvantage; and hence the attack. Though Man Singh held the field it was still a close run thing ",
