And the thing with the Nazis is, there have been many other regimes which at times did something terrible as a side incident, but slaughtering civilians from groups they didn\u2019t like was absolutely central to the Nazis\u2019 ideology. Think of the US civil war.

Unfortunately, even when the extent of the mass murder was discovered, the allies did not attend to stop the murder machine, and preferred to bomb German factories instead of e.g., railroads leading to the dead camps.
