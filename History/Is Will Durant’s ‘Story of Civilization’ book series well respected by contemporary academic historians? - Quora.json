            "answer_text": "Oh,I remember those books from high school. Durant was a wonderful narrative writer and in some ways very much ahead of his time. He scolded historians for their Eurocentric views of history. He urged more study of Oriental,Latin American and African history. He would be very pleased to know of present day historians exploring these areas. But Durant drew a lot of his material from secondary sources. That is,books like his own. This is perfectly fine for a high school or college undergrad. Nor was it that unusual at the time. Even today,if you look at the bibliography in a history ,after the lists of primary sources there will be pages of secondary ones. This makes sense. If Professor X is a widely respected authority on a topic you don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel and read all his original sources. It\u2019s just that the ratio of primary to secondary sources is rather thin in Durants case. This is no longer acceptable practice. Plus there have been any number of discoveries since he wrote his books. He certainly isn\u2019t a waste of your time. But while they are an enjoyable outing you should also read something more recent as a comparison. Comparing histories of the same era written at different periods is called historiography. It is something all historians must familiarize themselves with to detect the biases and knowledge gaps of another era. ",
