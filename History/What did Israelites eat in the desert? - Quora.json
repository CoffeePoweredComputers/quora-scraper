            "answer_text": "During the forty years between the time the  Israelites left Egypt and entered the Promised Land, they faced harsh  conditions, including a scarcity of food. To alleviate this problem, God  miraculously provided the Israelites with \u201cbread from heaven,\u201d called  \u201cmanna.\u201d The manna appeared each morning, and the Israelites were given  specific instructions on gathering it (see Exodus chapter 16). What was  manna? Interestingly, the Israelites asked the very same question: \u201cWhen  the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, \u2018What is it?\u2019  For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, \u2018It is the  bread that the LORD has given you to eat\u2019\u201d (Exodus 16:15). The Hebrew word translated \u201cmanna\u201d literally means \u201cwhat is it?\u201d The Bible nowhere discusses the chemical composition of manna. All we  are told is that \u201cit was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it  was like wafers made with honey\u201d (Exodus 16:31). Numbers 11:7 states that manna\u2019s appearance was like \u201cbdellium\u201d or \u201cresin.\u201d Psalm 78:24 refers to manna as \u201cgrain from heaven,\u201d and the next verse calls it  \u201cbread of angels.\u201d So, manna seems to have been literal bread that God  caused to miraculously appear each morning during the Israelites\u2019  wilderness wanderings. The miracle of manna ceased shortly after the  Israelites entered the Promised Land (Joshua 5:12). Far more important than manna\u2019s physical qualities is what manna  foreshadowed. Manna is a type, or foreshadowing, of Jesus. After Jesus  miraculously fed the 5,000, they wanted Him to \u201cgive us this bread  always\u201d (John 6:34).  Jesus tried to get their attention off of physical bread and onto the  true \u201cbread of life.\u201d \u201cTruly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who  gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread  from heaven. For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and  gives life to the world. . . . I am the bread of life; whoever comes to  me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst\u201d (John 6:32-35).  Sadly, the people could not get their minds off of physical bread long  enough to understand the spiritual truth Jesus was declaring (John 6:36-59). They were more concerned with the condition of their stomachs than the condition of their souls. Just as God provided manna to the Israelites to save them from  starvation, He has provided Jesus Christ for the salvation of our souls.  The literal manna temporarily saved the Israelites from physical death.  The spiritual manna saves us from eternal death. \u201cYour fathers ate the  manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes  down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die\u201d (John 6:49-50). http://www.gotquestions.org/what-was-manna.html ",

            "answer_text": "Well if any ever ventured that way \u2026they probably ate what little food they could bring with them. As for the biblical Exodus account is concerned in literal reality it never happened. So the people did not go into the desert. They did not eat anything in the desert. Please, what is more important. The keeping of perpetuating some fairytale mythology story just because a religion wrote it down? Or , actual factual demonstrable history? The Exodus out of Egypt never happened. We have literal physical evidences that prove that Egypt never had a group of Hebrew/Isrealite/Jew slaves like that at anywhere near that time period. These evidences not only exist in Egyptian records but of other neighboring civilizations that dealt with Egypt and who were even enemies to Egypt. Infact those who supplied Egypt their slaves at that time do not have mention of that many slaves of one particular people. Please be aware, that this story account gives an estimated just over 2 million people. There is no mistake here unless the religious story fabricated a bunch of stuff..then that is just a discredit to the validity of the story. Either those who first wrote the story lied, or the story is a lie. That's the choices. So, literally historians of all walks of ancient texts, religion, religious texts, folklore, oral lore and mythology and just about any area that could apply have been studying and investigating this area about Moses and the exodus story for many many decades. It has been conclusively found that the exodus NEVER occurred. It has been conclusively found that Moses factually NEVER existed. There was never a group wandering in a desert for 40 years. Please at least go look at the desert area that they had to of been in for that time period. Look at its size, check what the distance was between were they would of started to their destination. That distance and area a person can cross in 2 weeks on foot. With 2 million people the first leaving would have already arrived before the last people could leave. With that many people it is literally impossible to have been in that desert and not of been seen by other people and civilizations and yet no one records anything of them. And some of these people were traversing that desert areas regularly..still never seen these people..not in any amount of the 40 year period. It just did not happen..Period! ",
