            "answer_text": "Marcos was a class of his own! For a time he held the Guinness World record for being the biggest plunderer of the Philippine\u2019s riches. Sadly, 34 years after he was deposed, we are still paying for all the debts he incurred. He was also in a class of his own for murdering, arresting, and torturing political enemies. In the tens of thousands. He was EVIL personified. Everything he did was to enrich himself and to keep him and his family in power. But like all evil doers, karma caught up with him. He died a lonely, hated man. ",

            "answer_text": "Boon Ferdinand Marcos spearheaded numerous infrastructure projects which outnumbered the projects initiated by all his predecessors and some successors combined. In a sense, he is comparable to Rodrigo Duterte and the current Build Build Build Policy. Bane His infrastructure projects incurred huge debts which crippled the economy under his tenure. The Peso depreciated by so much due to the lack of business confidence which drove many foreign direct investments out. He brought in corruption and nepotism which plagued politics and the economy. Only a select few flourished while the poor became poorer. Martial Law led to the rule of fear and political enemies were detained, jailed and even assassinated. Benigno Aquino is the prime example. He was a smart president who cunningly manipulated the Constitution democratically to his favour. The 1973 Constitution was made to suit Marcos\u2019 personal ambitions. ",
