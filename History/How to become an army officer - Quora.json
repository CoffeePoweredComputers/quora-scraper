            "answer_text": "First of all don't say that i \"wanted\" to be an army officer as you are only 15 and you'll get all the chances in the world to realize your dream. Now coming to the the answer, there are two broad ways you become an army officer- by 10+2 entry schemes or by graduation entry schemes. 10+2 Entry Schemesa. By clearing NDA exam followed by SSB- This exam is conducted twice in a year. You can appear for it any number of times. You will be eligible for it once you are in class XII(thoughyou can appear it before also for practice as they don\u2019t do any verification before). You can give the second exam of the year when in class XII as the complete procedure takes around 1 year so you will pass XII by the time you will clear everything (if at all you will).*You need not be a student of PCM in order to appear or qualify or apply for this exam though if you are from PCM stream you will have an edge over the others especially in maths and your chances will be high for clearing the written exam. b. By applying under TES i.e Technical Entry Scheme for which you must be a student of PCM stream (as this entry makes technical officers). They see only marks of Physics, Chemistry and Maths for merit. If your marks are high enough then you will get a direct call for SSB. Usually the cut-off is around 84% but if you PCM aggregate is above 86 you can be sure that you will get the call for SSB. Graduation Entry SchemesNow this is a very wide area with so many entries. CDS, TGC, AFCAT, UES etc etc. All the entries are different from each other. Some for engineers some open for all. Since you are 15 only so you don't have to worry about these now. Keep one thing in mind getting called for SSB is not the difficult task but clearing it is and in order to become an officer in the Army of in any defense force you will have to clear the SSB.And remember don't give up on it, if you can dream it you can be it :)A youtube link for a little motivation: ",
