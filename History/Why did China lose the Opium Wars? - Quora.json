            "answer_text": "There was a technological gap of several centuries when it came to naval warfare, there really wasn\u2019t even a one in a million chance they could have stopped the British fleet. On land the British firepower advantage was perhaps less marked. The British were equipped with smoothbore flintlock muskets and some percussion cap muskets, they also brought along some (light) artillery. In the Qing army only around one in three carried a gunpowder weapon and these were all matchlock muskets, whatever cannons they had were not expertly used according to British accounts. Whats really telling is that the Qing army was easily routed and that they suffered from very poor morale, some attribute this to the Han-Manchu animosity and in a few cases the ethnic Manchu troops were the only ones to put up a resistance. The most significant threat the British faced was actually when a peasant militia descended on them when rain had rendered their flintlocks useless. The British assumed a square formation and held of the enemy with bayonet points. The account then goes on to mention that if the militia, equipped with pikes and spears, had actually charged they would surely have annihilated them but it never came to that. Their best bet would have been a diplomatic solution like the Convention of Chuenpi - Wikipedia but that failed as both governments refused to ratify it. ",

            "answer_text": "China was then ill-equipped in war equipments and materiel to deal with the more advanced and well-equipped British military. Though the Chinese put up a semblance of a fight, they were never a match. Short in height, reach and sight, they were practically outclassed by the British. But it\u2019s a different ballgame now, the Chinese now have world-class military, equipment, training, and more importantly, corrective lenses (more than 70% of Chinese are short-sighted). No more \u201cSick Man of Asia\u201d, China is now the world\u2019s second strongest economy next to USA, and the third in military might, next to USA and Russia. ",
