            "answer_text": "Can the .22 Long Rifle kill you? Oh hell yes. Statistically speaking, .22LR is responsible for the second most gun-related fatalities annually of any caliber, after 9mm Luger. The .22LR has a muzzle energy of between 120 and 180 ft lbs. That\u2019s not much, relatively speaking; the 9mm Luger has about double that, with other common defensive handgun calibers increasing from there, and when you get into other rifle calibers you can easily find cartridges with twenty times the energy per shot. However, a hunting arrow tops out at around 80 ft lbs. If those can kill a deer, a .22 can kill a human. .22LR is not generally recommended as a defense caliber for a number of reasons, including more than a little hubris among gun owners. More practically speaking, while the .22LR is as likely to kill as many other cartridges, it\u2019s much less likely to incapacitate. That is the name of the game in self-defense; you don\u2019t necessarily need to kill your assailant, what you need to do is stop your assailant attacking you as quickly as you can. Larger bullets have the energy and momentum to do more \u201cstructural\u201d damage with a greater chance to make an attacker physically unable to continue. .22LR causes most of its damage through internal blood loss, which can take up to 20 seconds to render a human unconscious. While not great at incapacitating, the .22LR remains very capable of being lethal. Among the reasons for the .22\u2019s fatality statistics include its being the most commonly-owned caliber among gun owners (no matter what else you have, if you own more than one gun you\u2019re very likely to own a .22 if only as a \u201crange toy\u201d, and despite incapacitation issues it is commonly marketed for self-defense for small size and high \u201cdensity\u201d of rounds in a given magazine volume), the number of shots required to incapacitate (while the .22, statistically speaking, required the fewest \u201cshots to stop\u201d on average, it also had one of the highest percentages of assailants not incapacitated by any number of hits), and the general perception that the smaller, cleaner hole of a .22 means less damage was done. When there are a lot of opportunities for a .22 to be the closest thing to hand, when you need a lot of shots to dissuade an assailant, and when your assailant is still on his feet after being shot and so can get away from not only police but prompt medical attention, the .22 tends to prove a fairly insidiously lethal round.

            "answer_text": "Anything can kill you! There were murders done with pencils, hands, feet, sticks, stones, hammers, knives, cars, trucks, thighs, nail cutters, nail-guns, chainsaw, air guns, David killed Goliath with a sling, machetes killed 800k in Rwanda/1994, even the .22LR carbine\u2019s stock can kill someone as well you can beat s.o. to death with the barrel\u2026 Now, if you hit the heart, an artery or the brain (it needs more energy to penetrate the skull), yeah, .22LR is lethal, if it hits somewhere else, providing the fact you get medical treatment, it\u2019s unlikely to be life threatening, while, for more serious calibers, e.g. think about a .44, you may end killing someone even by shooting in the butt. The truth is : now matter the caliber, or tools, objects, etc, anything can be used as a weapon and it\u2019s no more dangerous that the person using it! I\u2019d be much trustful seeing a sportshooter with a machingun, since there is no way you get such licence while having criminal or mental health records, than facing a street-dealer high on crack with a knife or a crowbar. 1st time I used a firearm was at community fair, \u2019twas about 1978 and I shot many pellets and rounds since\u2026 I NEVER pointed either a pistol or a rifle on anyone, not even an air-gun therefore MY .22LR is unlikely to kill you\u2026 Then, by the early 90\u2019s, there was a tall dumb guy who used to come at my preferred bar and socialised\u2026 1 year later, he ended on the front page off the country\u2019s newspapers : he was the most prominent serial killer since WW2 here\u2026 Well, hopefully, you\u2019re unlikely to ever cross his path as he\u2019s serving lifetime in jail, thus, he even killed two children banging their heads on the ground. With a guy like this one, yup, .22LR will kill you too, but actually, it\u2019s not .22LR or any caliber or any firearm that will kill you, it\u2019s the person holding a weapon, or simply using his bare hands or feet\u2026 Weapons don\u2019t kill people : thee truth being that\u2026 people kill people. Just think about Switzerland : EVERYBODY has a SIG Assault Rifle at home, they\u2019re even GIVEN TO YOU by the state at the end of your mandatory military service\u2026 They have one of the lowest murder rate and criminality rate on Earth\u2026 You can\u2019t own any (legal) firearm in Costa-Rica, but your life is 20x more likely to end through a murder than in Switzerland, and 2x more likely than in the USA\u2026 In El-Salvador, it\u2019s 100x more risky than Switzerland and 10x more risky than USA\u2026 France have very restrictive gun laws and ends with the double of Switzerland\u2019s murder rate\u2026 And the most commonly used weapons for murder are\u2026 your kitchen knives!!! In more than 40 years of shooting, I didn\u2019t ended with a single wound. The number of times I ended with knife wounds through cooking or other cutting activities is countless, and statistically, I\u2019m way more likely at risk to be killed by stabbing than by .22LR, especially as there is not a single sports-shooter having murdered someone in my country of 70 millions!!!!

Another lawyer I know took the case of an Iraq war veteran with PTSD who bought a .22 long rifle semi auto rifle with the intention of killing himself with it. (To anyone who objects that this seems an unlikely choice for a suicide tool, especially for a former soldier trained in firearms, I have to agree, but at least that\u2019s why he said he bought the gun). So he\u2019s sitting in his truck at a city park thinking about ending his life when a jogger runs by on a path. Then (for reasons known only to him and God) he decides he\u2019s not the one who needs to die that day. He doesn\u2019t do anything right away, but waits for the runner to put 130 yards between him and his truck. Then he opens the window and shoots him four or five times in the back. The results aren\u2019t immediately dramatic. The jogger stops, turns around and stares at him in surprise, as if to say \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Then he wonders off and dies. I think he ended up getting a 30 year sentence, but that\u2019s not the point. The point is don\u2019t underestimate the .22 long rifle. It can kill and frequently does. ",

            "answer_text": "An ice pick can kill you, it\u2019s just a matter of you getting punctured in the right spot. Decades ago I worked at the County Hospital, where all the gunshot victims went, because it also had the best trauma center. Surgeons told me they would much rather treat someone shot by a .45ACP because that tended to drill right on through unless it hit a very major bone. Nice straight, clean wound channel. But if they had a .22 shooting, the bullet de-stabilized and left a ragged wound channel right off the bat, which was harder to repair. Also, it would change course inside the body, tending to ricochet off every rib, etc. that it got close to. The wound channel was not only ragged, but might go any direction(s) inside the body. A .22LR can actually be more likely to kill someone that a big-bore handgun, but a .45ACP will make someone stop what they are doing, and immediately. A .22LR will not do that unless you manage an immediately fatal shot, or one to a joint, like a knee or elbow. After the fact, though, you are more likely to die in a day or two without treatment from a .22LR than from a big-bore handgun. IT just all depends on where you are hit with what. ",

Secondly, the .22 caliber LR is the most frequently used firearm of professional (if you want to call them that) assassins.

BUT it doesnt mean it will always kill you , a little girl i think she was 6 was shot in the head with a .22. she was sleeping and there was a party going on , the guy accidentally shot the gun. it went through the wall into the next room and hit the girl in the head, she survived but the bullet is permanently lodged in her brain.
