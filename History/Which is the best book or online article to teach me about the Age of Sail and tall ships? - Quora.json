            "answer_text": "There are already a lot of good answers here, so I\u2019ll second many of the recommendation. In the fiction department, you have the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O\u2019Brian following the careers of Jack Aubrey, a Royal Navy captain, and Stephen Maturin, a naval surgeon and intelligence agent. That bald description makes it sound implausible, or maybe hackneyed Rip Roaring Tales of the High Seas for Boys pulp but it isn\u2019t. The series is more like what you would have gotten if Jane Austen and Ian Fleming had collaborated on a travel series with Joseph Conrad as editor. The series is so varied that it difficult to characterize, but calling it historical fiction pigeonholes it, it really succeeds as a just plain old fiction. The Aubrey-Maturin series succeeds on another level as well: O\u2019Brian did his historical homework and it is a faithful recreation of the 19th century Royal Navy. Patrick O\u2019Brian also wrote a couple of independent narratives of Anson\u2019s circumnavigation - The Golden Ocean and The Unknown Shore - that have some of the same elements as the Aubrey-Maturin series but with different emphases. If you like the Aubrey-Maturin series, you\u2019ll like The Golden Ocean and The Unknown Shore. In the history department. the works of N.A.M. Rodger have been recommended, and I\u2019ll second the recommendation of The Command of the Ocean and The Wooden World: an Anatomy of the Georgian Navy. And I would add Rodger\u2019s The Safeguard of the Sea too for a history of the Royal Navy before the 19th century. Other histories I would recommend:  Cochrane: The Real Master and Commander by David Cordingly Patrick O\u2019Brian modelled Jack Aubrey on Thomas Cochrane. Cordingly\u2019s biography of Cochrane is the real-life counterpart to O\u2019Brian\u2019s series.  Six Frigates: The Epic History of the Founding of the U.S. Navy by Ian Toll Six Frigates chronicles the construction of the first purpose-built warships of the fledgling U.S. Navy and their actions against rogue piratical states in the Mediterranean and the Royal Navy in the War of 1812.  Over the Edge of the World by Laurence Bergreen Even though the 16th century world of Magellan is vastly different than ours, Bergreen brings Magellan\u2019s voyage to life. Some quick historical mentions: In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex by Nathaniel Philbrick; the fate of the Essex was the inspiration for Moby Dick. The Armada by Garrett Mattingly; an excellent history of the Spanish Armada. In the how-to department, there\u2019s  Wooden Boats: In Pursuit of the Perfect Craft at an American Boatyard by Michael Ruhlman. Ruhlman doesn\u2019t describe the building of really large sailing vessels, but many of the same techniques are still used in building small boats. Also, WoodenBoat Magazine often does features on the restoration and construction of large sailing vessels if you are interested in the nuts-and-bolts (which is probably not the right metaphor here).

            "answer_text": "Possibly not what you\u2019re asking, but I can whole-heartedly recommend the Aubrey-Maturin series of novels by Patrick O\u2019Brian[1] . There are 20 in all and I\u2019ve read the whole series twice (it\u2019s even possible to read it as one gigantic novel in 20 parts). The Russell Crowe movie Master and Commander: Far Side of the World[2] is an adaptation of parts of several of the books and is very enjoyable as far as it goes, but the originals are much more involving and give very detailed descriptions of life at sea and the challenges of handling warships in the early 19th century. They also have a lot of historical colour illustrating the attitudes and behaviour of the people, mostly men of course, who sailed in them. Utterly fascinating, but the author never talks down to the reader and uses a lot of sometimes very arcane technical jargon, which of course you can always look up (that\u2019s what Google is for after all). I think what makes me like these books so much is the sense that the author is writing them for his own enjoyment as much as for ours.
