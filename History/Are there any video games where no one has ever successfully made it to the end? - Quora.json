            "answer_text": "Yes. Sometimes because the games are so freakishly hard. Sometimes because programmers were lazy. Sometimes, because the programmers honestly did not expect the player to make it that far. In the game called \u2018Smash TV\u2019 from the 90s, players would reach a locked door at the end after hours and hours of game play. Rumor was that if they collected enough keys, they could unlock the door and enter a secret room called the \u2018Pleasure Dome\u2019. But honestly, that was just a myth. The programmers never expected anybody to make it that far. So they never programmed that section.  from Wacky Wednesday: Smash TV\u2019s Pleasure Dome As with most sadistic video games, Smash TV dangled a carrot in front of players willing to spend enough time (and money) to earn their reward. Anyone managing to brute-force his way through Smash TV was greeted by a screen telling him that while he\u2019d done a great job kicking everyone\u2019s ass, he\u2019d failed to collect enough keys to become a Grand Champion, and only Grand Champions could enter the Pleasure Dome. \u201cEntering the Pleasure Dome\u201d sounds suspiciously enough like a euphemism for \u201cgetting laid\u201d that no red-blooded American male could decline such an opportunity. Unsurprisingly, players pumped even more money into the machine on the hunt for Grand Champion status. As Mark Turmell related in a 2013 interview with Polygon, the Pleasure Dome was nothing more than a joke he and his co-designers put in to taunt players who slogged through the arcade equivalent of Green Beret training. The team wasn\u2019t sure anyone would beat Smash TV; doing so would require the average player to spend roughly the GDP of Ghana in quarters just to beat Mutoid Man, the game\u2019s first boss. Life, of course, proved otherwise and it didn\u2019t take long for skilled players to start asking arcade operators why it was impossible to be crowned Grand Champion and get into the Pleasure Dome no matter how many keys they picked up.  However, this ending is sort of a bonus level (that does not exist). The game\u2019s normal ending would be when you battle the main villain (the show\u2019s host if you know the story of the game).

All it takes is for a designer to accidentally type in an integer or two too many. My first decently playable game I made in university was impossible to beat, because I had to rush for a deadline. I did not get to play test my third level, which had a creature that could one shot you(intentional), but had the speed of The Flash from the Justice League Unlimited(unintentional). It was called Cobalt Colt Balt ",
