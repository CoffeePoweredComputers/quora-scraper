            "answer_text": "The main drawback to the veto right is that the US can, and does, block important resolutions and decisions, particularly regarding Israel\u2019s human rights violations. Here is a short list: US blocks UN vote to condemn Israeli demolition of Palestinian homes  The US refuses to condemn the kind of demolition depicted above. Palestinians have no rights in their own territory. US blocks UN resolution condemning Israel for deaths in Gaza clashes U.S. blocks UN resolution denouncing Israeli expulsion of Hebron monitoring group U.S. VETO BLOCKS A U.N. RESOLUTION CRITICIZING ISRAEL The resolution [blocked by the US] deplored \u201cIsrael's failure to put a stop to actions and policies tending to change the status of the city of Jerusalem\u201d and called on Israel to refrain from taking steps against Arab inhabitants of occupied areas, to respect the \u201cinviolability of the holy places,\u201d and desist from alleged expropriation of Arab land or the establishment of Israeli settlements on it. [and of course, Trump has gone much further, declaring Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel, even though E. Jerusalem belongs to the Arabs and houses the second most important shrine in Islam] Here is one from Quora: Why did the US block a UN resolution calling for independent inquiry of Israel for the deaths of protesters in recent Gaza clashes? Doesn't the US care about human rights now? The above is just a small sampling. ",

            "answer_text": "The cons are that it has become a honeymoon meeting place for the political elite, a place where they can address their grievances without research, and ponder on the answers they will never get back from a security council designed to protect the personal interest of the Leaders of the member countries. The veto right is the most stringent form of dictatorship and colonialism in our modern-day. It is a council designed to promote the secret and antagonistic ideologies of dictatorships and ultra-conservative agendas. It a Veto power that can be used as a determining factor for growth, while at the same time may be used to destroy a nation. Its the worst thing that the world has ever made. If the world believes in the independent rights of each nation and its citizens, why then do we need a veto power, by a few countries from achieving their independent goals? ",
