            "answer_text": "The LSE quotes trades using sterling (GBP) - A currency that is continuing to loose value against nearly every major international currency. If a gold mining company was to pursue a secondary listing on the LSE, the company would open itself up to currency risk (major negative) whilst at the same time, could possibly appeal to investors seeking investments into a more safer or secure asset (Gold). In summary: Positive = Appeal to LSE traders / investors seeking exposure to a generally accepted safer alternative to GBP. Negative = Company is now valued in GBP, which is devaluing and therefore has exposed itself to unnecessary currency exchange risk that it was not previously exposed to. Is this a university question? ",
