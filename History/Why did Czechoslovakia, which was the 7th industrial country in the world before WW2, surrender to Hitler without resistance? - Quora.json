            "answer_text": "In 1929, Czechoslovakia had the world\u2019s 7th or 8th highest total nominal GDP in the world. In 1933 and/or 1934, according e.g. to this book Encyklopedie v\u00fdkonnosti, 1933, Czechoslovakia was 10th \u2013 the decrease was because the Great Depression had a somewhat bigger impact on Czechoslovakia than the average country (and the ethnic Germans were those who primarily suffered in Czechoslovakia \u2013 one of the reasons why they got so enthusiastic about Nazism). But Czechoslovakia, even if it were still at the spot #7, where it no longer was in 1938, decided not to actively fight against Germany because Germany\u2019s total GDP was larger than the Czechoslovak ones \u2013 the number was smaller than #7 although I don\u2019t know what the number exactly was. Germany was surely the world\u2019s top 5 economy. Much of Germany\u2019s impressive growth before the Second World War was funded from debt and the debt was unsustainable \u2013 Germany really needed the war to avoid a different, internal economic, catastrophe. So Germany had the brute force advantage \u2013 significantly higher population, among other things, and by 1938, a higher GDP per capita than Czechoslovakia (even if I counted the Slovaks and ethnic Germans to be \u201cCzechoslovaks ready to fight for Czechoslovakia\u201d which would be unrealistic pretty much in both cases, and also in the case of Hungarians: Czechs would be the only clearly anti-Nazi warriors in such a war). And in Munich, Czechoslovakia was betrayed by its key formal Western ally, France, and indirectly by France\u2019s main ally, Britain, which was believed to act as the ally of Czechoslovakia, too. But it didn\u2019t. So Czechoslovakia would be facing a war with a clearly larger enemy \u2013 while it would be uncertain about the internal support due to the ethnic composition of Czechoslovakia. And it was even imaginable that France and Britain could have joined the war on the German side. Czechoslovakia could have easily been framed as the \u201cevil side\u201d while Hitler could have become the Gentleman. So mobilization was announced in Czechoslovakia a few days before the Munich Treaty. The Munich Treaty could have implied the orders to defend the border against the German troops (mountains and fortresses on the border were promising but incomplete) \u2013 but these orders never came because Czechoslovaks mostly thought that this defense would be suicidal. And most Czechs, including historians, still think so today. Just to be sure, Czechoslovakia was very developed and it could beat larger enemies. In the Seven-Day Czechoslovak-Polish war in 1919, Czechoslovakia also easily won a Blitzkrieg on the ground against a larger country by population, Poland (Zaolzie, a small region with a dialect that interpolates between Czech and Polish, was at stake). But Poland was clearly underdeveloped technologically. And its population was still substantially smaller than Germany\u2019s. To beat Germany isn\u2019t as straightforward as to beat Poland. Czechoslovakia only had the other allies in the South and East \u2013 Romania and Yugoslavia were members of the Little Entente along with Czechoslovakia. But these allies were rather weak. On top of that, the Little Entente was established as \u201canti-Austria-Hungary\u201d, as an alliance whose main goal is to prevent (the new and severely reduced) Austria and Hungary from re-establishing the Austrian-Hungarian Empire (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania covered the three main successor states of the monarchy that weren\u2019t considered \u201ccarriers of the statehood\u201d during the imperial times \u2013 and that were therefore remarketed as winners of the First World War). Yugoslavia and Romania could have been unwilling to fight against Germany. It wasn\u2019t the plan. Of course, if all of these nations saw the light, they should have and they could have fought Germany and they would have probably win (especially if Stalin helped early on). But we can\u2019t really edit the history in this perfectionist way. The foreigners behaved the way they did and with these external conditions, the full-blown defense looked suicidal. Our Polish cousins chose \u201cfight\u201d in a similar situation but it didn\u2019t end up too well for them. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of this guy:  Czechoslovakia was indeed a tougher nut to crack than most people would have thought. Their problem was that they were still not string enough to face Germany without allies. Those allies were Great Britain and France. After the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, some ethnic Germans in northwest Czechoslovakia (the Sudetenland) began agitating for annexation as well. Hitler was only too happy to seize on this and began agitating against Czechoslovakia, claiming \u201catrocities\u201d were being done to ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland. Enter Britain and France. A forceful and unified response would have stopped Hitler right there. In retrospect, it was the last chance to stop WW2 in Europe. But both countries were desperate to avoid war, and in the price of doing so was Czech territorial integrity\u2026 In a deal brokered by the Allies, the Sudetenland was given away in exchange for promises of peace. This was the infamous declaration by Neville Chamberlain (above) that he had obtained \u201cpeace in our day\u201d. Hitler was, or course, by no means satisfied with just part of Czechoslovakia and later came back for the rest. The Sudetenland was the hilly, most defensible area of the country. With it gone, the rest of Czechoslovakia had no real defense. It was obvious to the Czechs that France and Britain weren\u2019t going to war for them. So they surrendered. ",
