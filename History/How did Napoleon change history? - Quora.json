            "answer_text": " Napoleon Bonaparte brought so many changes that transform not just Europe, but the whole world too. One of it's largest impact is the broadcasting of Revolutionary Ideas by his army during his campaign all over Europe and North Africa. The impact of these ideas will always attached to any Republic, and Constitutional Monarchy, as it was derived to subdue the old Absolutism and Feudal ideas. This would be the starting fire to fires of revolutions throughout the World the next century. The second large impact would be on the implementation of Napoleon's Code (or some migh t say Code Napoleon). The code arranged France to be the first nation who acknowledge Religious Freedom constitutionally, and reordering the citizenship of France into an equal one (although woman is still limited in few terms). The code will be the base for nationalism act throughout Europe the following century, including in Italian Unification, Polish January Uprising, and Hungarian Revolution.  The third, and the most famous impact, will be on the Military side. Napoleon established the Corps system, a system which making his army a lot more faster to move than any other army in the world, thereby catching them off guard. This also allowed a single corp to do a full day action without support, as a corp consisted of its own Cavalry and Artillery. Another innovation would be the General Staff arrangements. Whilst the General Staff system was not came from Napoleon himself, but one of his Marshall, Berthier. This system allowed Napoleon to implemented his strategy into reality as quick and efficient as possible, while Napoleon didn't need to shout loudly to a messenger about the action moves. These system of military management and organisations will be implemented by the whole world, and now still being used, although with an advanced twist. Napoleon still had many more impacts, like his arrangement of the Rhine Confederation that would be a key role toward Prussia's German Unification, his campaign in Spain during the Peninsular War that bring down the Spanish Colonial Empire and gave birth the Latin Americans countries. And, his defeat at Trafalgar (technically, not his defeat, but his Vice Admiral's one, Villeneuve) would ensure British dominance over the seas until the ending days of World War II. Napoleon also the first to pioneer the research of Ancient Civilisation, most importantly Egyptian Civilisation during his Egyptian Campaign.  It seems that to this day, we would always being impacted by the decision of great (or terrible) rulers from the past. Napoleon's impact would always be feeled as long as democracy and human rights is implemented in the course of humanity. ",

Nicolas Appert took Napolean\u2019s challenge to heart and developed a system of sealing food in glass jars. And it worked! No one would out why it worked until Pasteur demonstrated that it was the presence of microbes that led to food spoiling, but that\u2019s another story. ",
