            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A, Carol. When I saw this question, I thought at first that I could answer it in no time. Then, I realised two things: First, I was about to write a really long list, and, second, Greeks still excell in the same fields as they did in the old times: poetry and philosophy. (don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep my list short) Philosophers I. Theodorakopoulos, K. Axelos, I. Papanoutsos, K. Tsatsos, K. Kastoriadis and others. Highly recommended: C. Kastoriadis Cornelius Castoriadis - Wikipedia , especially his work: \u201cAncient Greeks and the modern West\u201d. You will never think of Ancient Greeks (or modern West) in the same way. Novelists A lot of you know N. Kazantzakis; his novels \u201cZorba the Greek\u201d (1946) and \u201cThe last temptation of Christ\u201d (1953) were turned into movies. A. Samarakis, V .Vasilikos (his novel \u201cZ\u201d was also adapted into film), Maro Douka, Petros Markaris, A. Doxiadis. Highly recommended: A. Doxiadis Apostolos Doxiadis .His book \u201cLogicomics\u201d is an essay on logic, very pleasant and innovative, you\u2019ll going to love it. Poets I imagine that most of you are not familiar with contemporary Greek poetry but G. Seferis and O. Elytis are Nobel prize winners. Also G. Ritsos, Engonopoulos, Empeirikos, Cavvadias, Kafafy are well known poets. Highly recommented: Constantine Kavafy. Here is a token of his work: Ithaca; Sean Connery, music by Vangelis. A masterpiece. Enjoy!  ",
