            "answer_text": "Keep in mind the strong division in the Arab mind between southern Europe - which they saw as a temperate and civilized clime - and the north, which they saw as a desolate land much like the Eurasian Steppe. The Romans/Byzantines occupied a third slot, though by the time of this article they were out of the picture. I understand the question to mostly refer to northern Europe, the \u201cFranks\u201d in Arabic and Greek parlance, and so will focus on them. The 14th c. scholar Ibn Khaldun\u2014an authority widely read down to late Ottoman times\u2014gives the following description. I will roughly paraphrase it, using some of Ibn Khaldun\u2019s own expressions without copying pages on pages of text. I also note this is the most \u2018educated\u2019 people could know; 90% knew less than this, and hardly any knew more. I encourage the reader to pretend he knows nothing more than this list to reconstruct the medieval (lack of) context for facts about Europe: The country of the Franks is situated in the cold, northern part of the world, along with the Khazars, Alans, and Turks. It faces out to the northern part of the Enclosed Sea. The natural climate of that land would, naturally, lead to people dumb and ignorant like animals, and many people of that land like the Slavs know no religion and dress in animal skins. But some nations of the Franks and Slavs, like some Turks and Ethiopians (who live in similarly savage climate), received religious law in old times and kept to it.The Franks have many kings, and just as the Christian dhimmis in Egypt have a Patriarch, the Patriarch of the Franks is called Pappa. The Pappa crowns a ruler called Emperador with his own hands, who has power over all of them. The Pappa tells the Franks to be united and not fight each other, and resolves their disputes. We have nothing more to say of their religion; \u201cGod leads astray whomever He wants to lead astray, and He guides whomever He wants to guide.\u201dThe country of the Franks beyond the mountainous north of Spain and the infidel Galicians, is ruled by non-Arab dynasties of whom we know little. The land beyond the Pyrenees is called Gascogne. Beyond Italy and the north coast adjoining it (of which a detailed list of cities and islands by name and inhabitants is given), there are the countries of Brittany and Poitou, then France and Flanders and Burgundy. The eastern Franks are called Alamanians, and theirs are the countries of Aquileia, and Burgundy farther north, and then Lorraine and Saxony, and Frisia on the shores of the Surrounding Sea.In this Sea is the island of England, which is a magnificent realm, with a northern peninsula, and the island of Ireland and the oblong isle of Norway. East of this is the country of the Finland Turks, and the country of Tavast and Estonia, which is covered in snow with little civilization. Facing the sea is also the land of Poland, neighbouring Hungary and the Carpathian mountains, which separate it from Russia, adjoining the land of the Khazars. These countries are on the coast of the Black Sea. Southeast of it is Constantinople.The below maps are from the Tabula Rogeriana, created by the Arab geographer Al Idrisi for the Christian king of Sicily. The visual product is modern\u2014the original map was spread over seventy pages of description, and inverted (south-to-north), but represents the peak of Arab geography. The civilized lands of Andalus and Italy, in the temperate clime:   Of all Europeans, he says: Their capital is Rome (and gives a fairly detailed description of the pilgrimage sites and Papal basilicas there), and they are of the Melchite persuasion (Melchite/Royalist: Chalcedonian), unlike the Egyptian dhimmis, who are Jacobite Christians.It is known to us that there is extensive study of philosophy in the lands of Italy and the adjoining coast, and both their preserved ancient texts and their newer commentaries are extensive. God surely has some hidden reason for giving unbelievers this knowledge.There are three alphabets worthy of mention, Syriac, Arabic/Hebrew and Roman. Only nations which study philosophy in their own language have a chance at producing great scholars, and this is common to the settled Arabs and the ancient Greeks. All others, like the Persians, Franks, Berbers and Turks, will have to work doubly hard for meagre results in foreign languages (Latin/Arabic).The Franks and Romans in ancient times ruled in (north) Africa, and the master of Rome sent great fleets against the master of Carthage. They oppressed the Berbers before the Arabs seized them, and long coveted to conquer Africa again. Knowledge of seamanship has persisted among these nations; and now they are unchallenged in maritime supremacy, while Syria and Egypt have completely abandoned knowledge of ships or sailing. Their decadence has allowed the Franks and Romans to take back Mediterranean islands like Crete and Cyprus.Only the Moslems in Africa and Spain retain knowledge of sea-craft, and are said by prophecy to one day defeat the Franks in their own country. \u201cGod is a friend of the believers\u201d (very prescient, as the Ottomans would rely on Berbers to do just that to the Spanish, who tried to conquer Africa just as Ibn Khaldun predicted)And here is the part in northern Europe; notice the presence of Brittany, England, Denmark and Norway; notice the comparative absence of cities; keep in mind the entire thing is pictured as smaller than the south:   Of the Franks: They prefer to fight in tight formations, and are often used as mercenaries in wars between Moslems in Africa and Spain, but never in jihad because they might turn traitor. It weakens the ummah that we have to rely on them in such a fashion.The Franks were one of the peoples who came down, together with the Turks, to deprive the Arabs of their sovereignty when the ancient dynasties lost their military vigour to decadence.The Franks and Galicians living in Spain, like the Turks, are fond of willingly going into slavery to attain high rank in the state, and are not ashamed of their subservient status. \u201cGod knows best\u201dThe Galicians in Spain south of the Pyrenees \u201cuse only a few flags, which fly high in the air. In addition, they make a kind of music with string and wind instruments on the battlefields. This is (all) the information we have about them and the non-Arab rulers who live beyond them.\u201dWhen the Franks and Romans ruled in Africa (Ibn Khaldun\u2019s own country), they didn\u2019t rule long enough to establish lasting civil authority or civilization among the Berbers. There are still rumours of treasure hidden by the old Franks, though nobody is able to find it.Here\u2019s the entire map. Notice that Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia and Central Asia fill a good half of it; and that India and China, though present, are minimalized. This reflects estimated size, but more importantly the amount of detail/knowledge the cartographer had available to put on the map:  ",

            "answer_text": "I have never forgotten reading the Syrian Usamah ibn Munqidh\u2019s views on the Frankish Crusaders when I was 13 years old. An excerpt from about 1175: Mysterious are the works of the Creator, the author of all things! When one comes to recount cases regarding the Franks, he cannot but glorify Allah (exalted is he!) and sanctify him, for he sees them as animals possessing the virtues of courage and fighting, but nothing else; just as animals have only the virtues of strength and carrying loads. I shall now give some instances of their doings and their curious mentality. In the army of King Fulk, son of Fulk, was a Frankish reverend knight who had just arrived from their land in order to make the holy pilgrimage and then return home. He was of my intimate fellowship and kept such constant company with me that he began to call me \"my brother.\" Between us were mutual bonds of amity and friendship. When he resolved to return by sea to his homeland, he said to me: My brother, I am leaving for my country and I want you to send with me thy son (my son, who was then fourteen years old, was at that time in my company) to our country, where he can see the knights and learn wisdom and chivalry. When he returns, be will be like a wise man. Thus there fell upon my ears words which would never come out of the head of a sensible man; for even if my son were to be taken captive, his captivity could not bring him a worse misfortune than carrying him into the lands of the Franks. However, I said to the man: By thy life, this has exactly been my idea. But the only thing that prevented me from carrying it out was the fact that his grandmother, my mother, is so fond of him and did not this time let him come out with me until she exacted an oath from me to the effect that I would return him to her. Thereupon he asked, \"Is thy mother still alive?\" \"Yes.\" I replied. 'Well,\" said he, \"disobey her not.\" A case illustrating their curious medicine is the following: The lord of al-Munaytirah wrote to my uncle asking him to dispatch a physician to treat certain sick persons among his people. My uncle sent him a Christian physician named Thabit. Thabit was absent but ten days when he returned. So we said to him, \"How quickly has thou healed thy patients!\" He said: They brought before me a knight in whose leg an abscess had grown; and a woman afflicted with imbecility. To the knight I applied a small poultice until the abscess opened and became well; and the woman I put on diet and made her humor wet. Then a Frankish physician came to them and said, \"This man knows nothing about treating them.\" He then said to the knight, \"Which wouldst thou prefer, living with one leg or dying with two?\" The latter replied, \"Living with one leg.\" The physician said, \"Bring me a strong knight and a sharp ax.\" A knight came with the ax. And I was standing by. Then the physician laid the leg of the patient on a block of wood and bade the knight strike his leg with the ax and chop it off at one blow. Accordingly he struck it-while I was looking on-one blow, but the leg was not severed. He dealt another blow, upon which the marrow of the leg flowed out and the patient died on the spot. He then examined the woman and said, \"This is a woman in whose head there is a devil which has possessed her. Shave off her hair.\" Accordingly they shaved it off and the woman began once more to eat their ordinary diet-garlic and mustard. Her imbecility took a turn for the worse. The physician then said, \"The devil has penetrated through her head.\" He therefore took a razor, made a deep cruciform incision on it, peeled off the skin at the middle of the incision until the bone of the skull was exposed and rubbed it with salt. The woman also expired instantly. Thereupon I asked them whether my services were needed any longer, and when they replied in the negative I returned home, having learned of their medicine what I knew not before. I have, however, witnessed a case of their medicine which was quite different from that. The king of the Franks had for treasurer a knight named Bernard, who (may Allah's curse be upon him!) was one of the most accursed and wicked among the Franks. A horse kicked him in the leg, which was subsequently infected and which opened in fourteen different places. Every time one of these cuts would close in one place, another would open in ancther place. All this happened while I was praying for his perdition. Then came to him a Frankish physician and removed from the leg all the ointments which were on it and began to wash it with very strong vinegar. By this treatment all the cuts were healed and the man became well again. He was up again like a devil. Another case illustrating their curious medicine is the following: In Shayzar we had an artisan named abu-al-Fath, who had a boy whose neck was afflicted with scrofula. Every time a part of it would close, another part would open. This man happened to go to Antioch on business of his, accompanied by his son. A Frank noticed the boy and asked his father about him. Abu-al-Fath replied, \"This is my son.\" The Frank said to him, 'Wilt thou swear by thy religion that if I prescribe to you a medicine which will cure thy boy, thou wilt charge nobody fees for prescribing it thyself? In that case, I shall prescribe to you a medicine which will cure the boy.\" The man took the oath and the Frank said: Take uncrushed leaves of glasswort, burn them, then soak the ashes in olive oil and sharp vinegar. Treat the scrofula with them until the spot on which it is growing is eaten up. Then take burnt lead, soak it in ghee butter and treat him with it. That will cure him. The father treated the boy accordingly, and the boy was cured. The sores closed and the boy returned to his normal condition of health. I have myself treated with this medicine many who were afflicted with such disease, and the treatment was successful in removing the cause of the complaint. *** The Franks are void of all zeal and jealousy. One of them may be walking along with his wife. He meets another man who takes the wife by the hand and steps aside to converse with her while the husband is standing on one side waiting for his wife to conclude the conversation. If she lingers too long for him, he leaves her alone with the conversant and goes away. Internet History Sourcebooks Project ",

            "answer_text": "From historical accounts we know that Europeans didn't really uphold decent personal hygiene. Or to put it blunt: medieval Europeans were filthy pigs, which was noted by the Muslims. Next to that, Europeans had build a nice reputation when they conquered Jerusalem. Now invading armies, both Muslim and Chrisians, often massacred some of the local defenders to set an example. That was just common practice. However, the cleansing of Jerusalem was apparently so severe that even then it raised eyebrows. As one historian described it: \"...[our men] were killing and slaying even to the Temple of Solomon, where the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles...\u201d. This, of course, only reinforced the view Muslims had of Europeans being barbarians. Also the Muslim world was far more developed then the Christian world. Science and technology were at a higher standard and more universally taught. Well into the 14th century, Christian scholars attended Muslim universities. So all in all, Muslims had good reasons, besides our differences regarding religion, to view Europeans as barbarians. ",

Amazon.com: The Crusades Through Arab Eyes (Saqi Essentials) (8601419936212): Amin Maalouf: Books Basically the Muslims viewed the Europeans like the Americans viewed the Soviets during the Cold War: technologically and scientifically backwards, bellicose, treacherous, uncouth and having completely different ideology and society. Yet they were amazed of the Frankish society: the rule of law instead of king\u2019s whim, the status of women as citizens and not as chattel, lack of slavery, organization and order of the society and the advanced state of economy. While the Arabs overlooked the Europeans as uncivilized barbarians because of their less advanced technology, science, medicine etc, they did not realize Feudalism was light years ahead Despotism as model of society and the Roman justice and law was far more advanced than whim of the despot and sharia. While the Franks just learned about anything worthy of learning from the Muslims, eagerly studied Arabic and absorbed knowledge, few Muslims bothered to learn Latin and really get to know their enemies. It can safely be said the woman\u2019s status in the 12th century Outremer was better than in most 21st century Muslim countries. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some interesting accounts from Muslim scholars of the time. In school we read one from Avicenna if I remember correctly. He was working in a hospital and wanted to treat a knight with an eczema on his leg with a herbal patch, when one of the priests pushed him aside and told the knight \u201cleg or life\u201d of which the knight chose the former, and then had it cut off with an axe. Now it has been a while since we read it and I could not find the text later, but what impressed me was the language in which it was written. Very dry and rational without any judgement, even though the described incident was quite awful. It seemed to me like he did not care at all about what happened. These were barbarians, and if they would not let him help, he would just watch. ",

IMHO quite sensibly the crusaders had a much easier time after that incident as the Muslims let them pass unchallenged as long as they went quickly \u2026,.even going so far as to bring them food to ensure they were well fed.
