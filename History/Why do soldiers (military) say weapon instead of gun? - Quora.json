            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m not a soldier, and have never been in a military of any kind, but spending so many years fencing, I think I know why. In fencing, we usually don't call the pointy sticks in our hands \u201cswords\u201d; Either they\u2019re called by their specific names (epee, foil, saber) or referred to en masse as \u201cweapons\u201d. In fact, when we compete, we have to go through a process called \u201cweapons check\u201d so that the \u201carmorers\u201d can make sure all of our gear is working and safe to use. Why do we call them weapons though? After all, at the end of the day, they\u2019re swords, albeit skinny and electric ones. We call them weapons because they have the CAPACITY to do harm.  One of the most common things people ask me when they hear I fence is \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d. The answer, at least for epee, is HELL YES it can. I have bruises, friction burns, lacerations, and a knock in the head or two to prove it. Anytime two people are physically fighting each other with tools, intending to harm the other person or not, those tools should be considered weapons. When my home club teaches little children how to fence, the first thing we do is teach basic weapons safety: When not fencing, keep your tip pointed at the floorWhy?: People taller than you can get hit in the face/eye or people can trip and fall on the tip.Always wear your mask, even if you\u2019re not hitting someone close to their face.Why?: Kids like to mess around and stab eachother in the arm/leg/tummy when it\u2019s not their turn to fence. The thing is, there\u2019s always a margin of error in humans where you can go wildly off target and accidentally hit the wrong thing (ie: Their bare face).Wear your mask when going HARD on a target (*this is a rule from my college team)Why?: Weapons can degrade over time and blades in particular are prone to fragmenting. My coach once had a kid whose blade snapped and part of it went through her own arm. He says he\u2019s grateful that it wasn\u2019t her face because your odds of recovering from a metal piece through the head are lower.Wear all of your safety equipment in general.The underarm protector is this little half shirt that a lot of people forget or chose to not wear. However there\u2019s a good reason all National refs check for this small undershirt- If a blade snaps and fragments, without that undershirt, the fragment can pierce the seam of your jacket and enter your lung or heart.Always check your equipment before a competition.Why: Not only do you not want to lose touches, but you also want to make sure you don\u2019t die. People have died before because of faulty untested masks where the blade breaks through the mask and penetrates your face. You don\u2019t want to be that person.Know how to do an action before you try it (*this is just good advice, not necessarily a rule)With bodies moving everywhere, it\u2019s really easy for things to go wrong quickly. For example, I\u2019ve been punched in the head by a girl who didn\u2019t know how to riposte and in trying to do so missed and right-hooked me in the side of the mask. People get concussed all the time for accidents like this.What this list shows is that even though fencing \u201cswords\u201d don\u2019t seem harmful, we still call them weapons because of their capacity to do harm. While not an everyday occurrence, here are some very real fencing injuries: Death from faulty mask being penetrated by blade.Concussion due to hit to head during flesche.Broken ankle from tripping during a fleshe.Punctured lung due to not wearing an underarm protector and a blade breaking.Black eye from doing target work without a mask (that was me \ud83d\ude33)Pierced arm due to blade breaking during target work.On the other side, guns aren\u2019t inherently dangerous when they\u2019re unloaded and out of the hands of someone. But, it\u2019d be foolish to not call them weapons. While the military generally teaches adequate gun safety, it\u2019s important to respect their capacity to cause injury even when handled properly. As such, out of respect to their potential, we should call guns weapons. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have said it is about clearly identifying the type of weapon system that is being used. A generic soldiers personal weapon system is his rifle and that is always referred to as a Weapon System or Personal Weapon, this allows for clarity as to which \u201cgun\" is being used. Also the word rifle, in the British Army at least, is used in reference to the sharpshooter rifle or the sniper rifle both of which are only carried by those specifically trained and authorised to use them. Gun is used to designate Machine Guns such as the GPMG or the LMG/HMG, this provides clarity again as to a different weapon system being used. As others have said gun is also used in the Navy to designate the on board heavy armaments, this ironically is in contrast to the traditional method of referring to Canon as guns when on land (or so I have been informed by guides working on board HMS Victoria). With other small arms the preference is to refer to them as the type of system they are, pistols for example are always referred to as pistols, not handguns or guns. Having said all that the British Army is very much concerned with the way things sound - weapon system and pistol sound a lot more professional and make more sense in reference to the platforms they describe, gun also makes more sense when referring to a Machine Gun especially as it is not a rifle and to refer to it as a weapon would only result in confusion. Most other weapon systems are referred to by either their designation or by the name given to them - Javelin for example.
