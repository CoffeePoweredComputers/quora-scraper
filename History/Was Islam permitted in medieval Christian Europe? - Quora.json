            "answer_text": "Sort of. In large parts of Europe, the only Muslims were people from somewhere else: merchants, diplomats, and the like. They were certainly not prevented from practicing their faith, though generally speaking they did so privately. The city of Constantinople had a mosque for some time, though it\u2019s not clear if it was associated with a Muslim diplomatic presence at the imperial palace or a neighborhood set aside for Syrian merchants. About the only places in Europe to see significant numbers of native Muslims under Christian rule were some places which had seen Muslim conquests which fell back into Christian hands, like Spain. During the Reconquista, increasing numbers of Muslims became subjects of advancing Christian rulers. Those Muslims were allowed to practice their faith, but were subject to a variety of restrictions and additional taxes. It wasn\u2019t until the early modern period, just this side of the Middle Ages, that Spain explicitly outlawed Islam (and while they were at it, Judaism as well). Similar things happened in southern Italy and Sicily, where Muslims were tolerated for a while but often sooner or later kicked out. ",
