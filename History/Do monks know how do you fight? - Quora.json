            "answer_text": "Yes, some do in some cultures. The monks of the Catholic and Byzantine/Orthodox churches generally do not unless they were warriors/knights before taking their vows. Christian monks place more emphasis on spiritual disciplines and doing good works toward the people in their community and thought fighting was not the way of God. However, during the Middle Ages there were groups of \u201cwarrior monks\u201d like the Knights Templar and the Hospitalers who both took vows of religious duty and fought. The Templars started as a group of knights protecting travelers on pilgrimage from Europe to Jerusalem and created Europe\u2019s first modern banking system. The Hospitalers lived in Jerusalem and provided protection, housing and care for Christian pilgrims entering Jerusalem and they at times did fight alongside other warriors during the Crusade wars of the region. On the other side of the cultural sphere in China, many Buddhist temples taught their monks spiritual disciplines of Buddhism and how to fight. This was because China at this time (ca 400\u2019s AD onwards) was very chaotic with a lot of different warlords fighting for control and marauders from these competing warlords constantly attacked the Buddhist temples and surrounding communities. Many of the popular styles of Chinese Kung Fu emerged from these Buddhist temples. Even to this day several Buddhist temples in China teach their monks Kung Fu as a matter of tradition and often tour around the world to display their skills. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was in Sri Lanka, I stayed for a week in a forest kooti (hut) which was in a fairly remote area. Beside the door, there was a stout staff about as thick as my wrist and five foot long. The monks who took me to the kooti warned me to keep my door locked at night because there were bandits about who would call to me to try to get me to open the door. The stick was for defence. That night I did indeed hear bandits pretending to be monks trying to get me to open the door. In Thailand, often kickboxers become monks when they retire. The same is true for martial artists in many countries. ",
