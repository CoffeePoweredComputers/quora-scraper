            "answer_text": "September 3, 1939 is the most likely candidate of many. On this date the UK and France declared war on Germany. While this may sound like a simple case of two nations vs. one, you have to consider the big picture in terms of the events leading up to that day and the composition of the nations involved. On September 2, 1939 Germany was allied with Italy, and had annexed Austria and half of Czechoslovakia. Hungary was basically a client state of Germany. Germany was also very close with Bulgaria and Slovakia (which would send troops to aid the Germans invade Poland). The Spanish Civil War had only barely ended a few months before with German backed Franco taking control. It would be anyone's guess if Franco would return the favor and join Germany. (He would, but only through covert aid, and not open warfare.) At the time Italy was fighting a war of occupation in Ethiopia and holding down a fractious Libya. It was fighting a war in Albania. The Soviet Union was preparing to invade Finland and Poland, and was unofficially at war with Japan in Manchuria (A ceasefire would be put in place on the 17th, and the invasion of Poland by the Soviets start that same day. Finland would be invaded a month and a half later.) The Soviets were, at the time, actually providing material support for Germany, leading to fears in France and the UK that the Soviets would be a German ally.  Japan was not yet an Axis power, but was at war with the Soviets and the Chinese, and relations with the Pacific colonial powers (UK, France, and particularly the US) were clearly headed towards war. Japan was allied with (puppet) Inner Mongolia and (puppet) Manchukuo (Manchuria). The United Kingdom had the loyalty of a vast number of currrent and former colonies, all of which would be expected to follow the UK's lead. These included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, much of Africa, and a number of holdings in the Pacific. France, similarly, had substantial holdings throughout Africa and the Pacific, as well as some in South America. So even though it was only technically two nations declaring war on a third, the world knew on 3 September that those three represented over 20 nations or nationlike entities that were guaranteed to get involved shortly, and that there were enough hot spots just waiting to boil over (the Pacific) that no one doubted that even more nations would join in. Earlier dates could also be selected, as particularly wise and thoughtful individuals were already crying out that a world war was coming as early as the start of the Spanish Civil War and the Soviet/Japanese fighting in Manchuria, but 3 September was the day there could be no further doubts.
