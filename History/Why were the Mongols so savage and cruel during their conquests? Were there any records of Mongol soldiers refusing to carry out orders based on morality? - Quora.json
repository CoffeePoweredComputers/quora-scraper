            "answer_text": "This question needs to be modified. They always send an envoy to recommend them to surrender. When he accepted the surrender, the country or village became a member of the empire and was granted all rights except taxes. In the case of a brutal attack, the case was followed by the denial to the recommendation of surrender, and in that case, the stronger the resistance, the more cruel the defeat was. However, when the defender's courage moved the heart of Mongolian soldiers, there was exceptional merciful treating. The reason that Mongolians justified their logic is their god Tengri. Tengri is the only god, and a legitimate ruler of all things in nature, although he has no personalities. The Mongolian army saw themselves as a tool to remove all internal barriers in human societies and unify them by the rule of Tengri. (But there was no pushing to admire Tengri.) The starting point was Baljuna covenant(1203), at Baljuna lake. Chinggis Khan and his nineteen colleagues in divergent backgrounds, made a covenant, and the motivation was increased like snowflakes, in Mongolian grassland. And it sustained. So they were basically not racist. In their empires, the background of their races, their tribes, and their class and ancestors did not affect them at all, and capable people climbed to the top in his sector according to their abilities. They truly pursued their philosophy. They viewed those who refused them as an obstacle to the elimination of walls in the human world, and so they tried to destroy them. Therefore, it is an ignorant and false belief based on racism that treats Mongolian Army at that time as cruel savages without any philosophy. ",

            "answer_text": "Why were the Mongols so savage and cruel during their conquests? Were there any records of Mongol soldiers refusing to carry out orders based on morality? Genghis took a Muslim city into the empire and in accordance to his own law, the Yasa, made freedom of religion mandatory. The Sunni adherents in that city were so outraged at seeing the Shia\u2019s openly worshiping Allah in their own way that they rose up in revolt. Big Mistake. Genghis sent his youngest son, Tuli, to put down the revolt with instructions, as was his standard practice, to kill everyone in that rebel city. Tuli retook that rebellious city and started killing and killing. He got so repulsed with what he was doing that he negotiated an agreement to stop if the populace and religious leaders would promise to abide by the Yasa. The army and Tuli had hardly disappeared over the horizon when the Sunnis revolted again and began killing Shias. Since this was clear and compelling evidence that his son had not carried out orders, by the Khan\u2019s own law, Tuli must be condemned to death. The Khan being a loving father called one of his generals to him and said, \u201cSince the dead rise up in revolt, strike the heads from their bodies.\u201d His general, lacking any expectation of familial mercy, took that order literally. Also wanting the Khan to see clearly that his order was carried out to the letter, piled all the heads outside the city gates. This is, to the best of my knowledge, the only time under Genghis that the Mongols made a head pile. ",
