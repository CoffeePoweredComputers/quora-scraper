            "answer_text": "Reality of life is dynamic. Phenomena emerge to take place then withdrawing back, other patterns occur, everything is constantly changing. What makes the world ordered (and not random) are laws of nature. In addition to natural laws of the physical reality, we experience also patterns governing our mental relationships with others. Our actions create reactions and have consequences. Consequences may take time to appear, they are latent possibilities. In both physical and mental field of existence, the Law or Order that decides what causes create given effects - is the Law that reality of life is manifesting. Everything in nature and in our own life - manifests the Law of Cause and Effect. The Law of Cause and Effect is the power that moves the world. Beacuse life is not possible without this order which binds all actions and give things their meaning - then this Law of Cause and Effect is Life itself. The word divine - in Buddhism - means that which is most precious. Because Life is most precious, then our life also is a manifestation of the Divine Order of cause and effect. Each person\u2019s life is divine. Hurting the divine is a cause which has consequences. Again, it is the divine which had already established the bond between causes and consequences, and it is called in Nichiren Buddhism MYO, Unexplainable Wonder (it is what Abrahamic religion call God, but with the difference that MYO is the Mind of the Universe, never created, and it is \u201cperson-less\u201d. Other properties of omnipotence and immanence etc\u2026 are the same). Abrahamic religions are based of Dualism, which separates the spiritual from the physical. (God existed separately before the physical universe). In Buddhism, the spiritual and the physical cannot be separated, so the Universe itself is a living entity - the Divine existence of Universal life. What is 'Divine' in Buddhism? ",

Next are the 7 HEAVENS which include the immediate afterlife realms - or Realms Of the recently departed ! These realms are inhabited by Seraphim and archangels and angels at the top to spirits of varying degrees of power all the way down to Earth ! Below the Earth realms are the Hell realms which are 7 all the way to TARTARUS !
