            "answer_text": "Visual anthropology is a term used to describe the broadened use of photography as a field method in cultural anthropology. It is usually credited to the work of anthropologist John Collier of San Francisco State University. He composed photos that capture the home environment and folkways of 20th-century Native Americans, and may have introduced or increased the emphasis on the idea of \u201ccultural inventories,\u201d extensively photographing the physical artifacts and everyday lives of people he studied. Visual Anthropology, his best known book, is still available. Visual Anthropology Collier was still on the faculty when I started grad school at SFSU and his son, Malcolm, was a grad student. John Collier was profoundly deaf, but worked hard to overcome it and engage students in debate and conversation. A digression: Collier was among the few faculty members who would challenge grad students to think about what they were going to do with their degrees instead of simply waking up with an MA one day and no job prospects. \u201cWhat will you BE?\u201d I remember him asking someone in a memorable tone of voice. He also taught and advocated \u201capplied anthropology,\u201d which was refreshing in the context of the hands-off doctrinal approach to studying cultures. I never went into academia, simply because the field was badly overcrowded. Instead, I became head of human resources at a pharmaceutical research and development company where I\u2019d worked to put myself through grad school. I spent most of my career as the \u201cmaintenance mechanic\u201d for a very valuable corporate culture. The cultural anthropology training was something I often applied to the organization and the people in it. Thanks, Dr. Collier. ",

            "answer_text": "First and foremost Visual Anthropology is the use of a visual medium to understand culture. That\u2019s quite broad I know but that\u2019s because there are a few flavors of Visual Anthropology. Ethnographic Filmmaking: Some visual anthropologists turn a camera on culture and try to use a visual medium, via filmmaking to not only understand culture, but also to help educate others. There are four main styles of ethnographic filmmaking and here is a link explaining them. Styles of Ethnographic Film MakingPhoto/Media Elicitation: This area of visual anthropology uses photography or some form of media to elicit responses from participants in the research. This may be as simple as taking photos of a ritual and asking your subjects to explain what they see in the picture or may be as complex as handing a number of your subjects cameras and then having them analyze each others pictures. Newer methods in this area include things like collaborative media making and even thinks like Participatory GIS (tasking the community with making maps together). Anthropologist Sarah Pink has a great book that covers some of this Doing Visual Ethnography: Sarah PinkAnalyzing Media Systems: Visual anthropologists such as myself sometimes look at the structure of already present media systems. This was in part the subject of my Masters thesis. Anthropologist Gillian Rose has a great book on this particular arena Visual Methodologies: An Introduction to Researching with Visual Materials: Gillian Rose And in it she talks about 3 sites of research within analyzing these systems (among many other things). Here is a short summary, there is obviously much more too it.The Site of Production: How does a piece of media get produced? What are the power dynamics and the social relationships around production?The site of Distribution: how is the media artifact distributed? Who has access to it and why? Why are some things more visible then others? Why are some things appealing and others not?The site of Consumption: What are the reactions to the viewing? What kind of people are viewing this artifact? How are they interpreting the cultural data and are the disseminating what they learned?There are more arenas of visual anthropology as well, and with social media there are all kinds of new and dynamic projects going on all the time. Check out Anthropologist John Postill for some interesting uses of Visual Anthropology. RMIT University - Academia.edu But above is a summary of 3 of the major areas of visual anthropology. I hope this was helpful. ",
