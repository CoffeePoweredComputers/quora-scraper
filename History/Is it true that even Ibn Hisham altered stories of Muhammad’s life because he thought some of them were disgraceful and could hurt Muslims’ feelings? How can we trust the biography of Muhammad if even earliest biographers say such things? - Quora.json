            "answer_text": "Histories would have written and rewritten to suit the new situations, and it is very likely that later writings show a different Image of Prophet Muhammad as compared to earlier ones. But saying that \u201cIbn Hisham altered stories of Muhammad\u2019s life because he thought some of them were disgraceful and could hurt Muslims\u2019 feelings\u201d is not true at all. Rather we see a different Image of how these hadith may have been altered or invented. It is usually said that if a tradition presents Muhammad in a bad light, then it must be true, for then \u2018it is unthinkable that the story could have been invented by Muslims\u2019. This is wrong. The Zuqnin Chronicler, from 774-775 CE says this regarding Abbasid era Muslim Arabs (who were compiling hadith); \"They are a very covetous and carnal people, and any law, whether prescribed by Muhammad or another God-fearing person, that is not set in accord with their desire, they neglect and abandon. But what is in accord with their will and complements their desires, though it be instituted by one contemptible among them, they hold to it, saying: \"This was appointed by the prophet and messenger of God, and moreover it was charged to him thus by God.\" In other words, during the Abbasid era, hadith were invented and altered to legalize what was previously set illegal by the Prophet PBUH. Early Christian writers wrote that Muhammad PBUH was a \u201cwise and God fearing Man who freed you (the Arabs) from slavery and brought you to know the one true God.\u201d The Jews and Nesotarian Christians had no problem in accepting that he PBUH was a messenger of God. It is interesting to note that there was no tradition or written text from the seventh century which \u2018presents Muhammad in a bad light\u2019, rather only during the Abbasid caliphate, we find such writings, on which one may criticize the prophet PBUH. So in the light of the above mentioned Zuqnin Chronicler, If one hadith has a covetous or a carnal nature or goes against the original teachings of the Prophet PBUH preserved in 7th century texts (including the most authentic in this regard, the Quran), it is to be considered a forgery. Hadith were changed or invented, not because the original were disgraceful, rather Abbasids wanted to escape legal punishments for a specific crime they committed, by saying that the prophet himself had legalized it. I will give you an example more closer to our times, Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore had relationships with several (and sexually assaulted at least one) teenage girls, in his defense Alabama State Auditor Jim Ziegler reached for one of the most reliable weapons, saying,\u201dMary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.\u201d Hence tried to legalize what Roy Moore had done.[1] Footnotes[1] Sorry, Roy Moore. Joseph Wasn\u2019t Twice Mary\u2019s Age. ",

            "answer_text": "Who made such a claim about Ibn Hisham and what is the certainty of such a claim? What is the proof of such alterations and what is the degree of such alternations ? It all must be substantiated by reliable and clear evidence.Prophet Muhammad (peac be upon him) didn't live a private life that could have remained unnoticed and known to a few \u201cconfidants\u201d, alone. His life, especially after receiving the message of Allah, was very open and it was observed by thousands - believers and disbelievers, lovers and haters, intelligent scholars and \u201cnaive\u201d Bedouins, alike. Thus, varioud aspects of his life and his message were widely known and widely transmitted.Ibn Hisham himself came much later after the passing away of Prophet (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) and his book was one of the many compilations that were written to record the already well established narrations about the Prophet (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645), that were well known since the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Many narrations were already recorded and preserved before Ibn Hisham. So even if any of these authors meant to alter the narrations to \u201csuit\u201d some \u201cpurpose\u201d, it would have been recorded and transmitted by other historians.Some narrations, about the Prophet (peace be upon him) were also dismissed by many illustrious scholars not because they wanted to \u201calter the facts\u201d but because the narrations didn't meet the criteria of authenticity (nevertheless, many of such narrations crept in to the lesser acclaimed works). This is something that happens everywhere - history, journalism, science, medicine and daily life etc - that the \u201ctrustworthy\u201d reports are accepted and reports from \u201cdubious\u201d sources are rejected (or if mentioned, they're not considered that reliable).",
