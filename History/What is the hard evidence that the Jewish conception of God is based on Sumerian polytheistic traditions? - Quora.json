            "answer_text": "There is no hard evidence, but there are a lot of similar themes. In Sumerian lore, the chief of the pantheon, Enlil, sent the Flood to destroy humanity, but gave Utnapishtim a heads-up, who managed to escape with his household in an ark. There is also the case of the first man, Adapa, who has some similarities to Adam. Abraham lived in the Sumerian city of Ur, so he was likely intimately familiar with their religious beliefs. But this is not to suggest that Enlil became the god of Abraham. Sumerians believed that each human had a personal god who gave them instruction, so it would not have been remarkable for Abraham's personal god to command him to head for Canaan. The psychologist Julian Jaynes wrote a fascinating book called Origins of Consciousness and the Bicameral Mind that makes a compelling case that the polytheistic tradition you refer to was not limited to Sumerians, but was a general feature of archaic human consciousness, and it provides a framework that neatly accounts for Abraham's experience. It could be the basis you are looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "To be clear - Hebrew conceptions of God, commencing with Abraham Aveinu, is nothing like the Sumerian Polytheistic traditions; that is the point. The OP has inserted a few mistakes into their fundamental premise 1) Jews did not exist in the Sumerian Period, 2) Abraham is the Patriarch of Hebrew Monotheism, and 3) no evidence is presented to prove Sumerians were polytheistic in a contemporary context (because they were not).   Hebrews, and Canaanites, who assemble at Mt Sinai are the people from whom \"Jews\" descend. The term \"Jew\" is a recent creation - not a biblical term.  The translation of Yehudi, of biblical Hebrew, into commonly known form of  \"Judahites\" \"Judeans\" and \"Jews\" is found only in english translations of the Hebrew Tanakh. The word Ioudaioi is used primarily in three areas of antiquarian texts:  Books of the MaccabeesNew TestamentPhilo.No Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, Hebrew or Aramaic text uses the term \"Jew\"; it is a bad transliteration of a Hellenistic term of the Septuagint.  The contemporary english term \"Jew\" derives from Old French \"Giu\" and \"Juieu\", which dropped the letter \"d\" from the Medieval Latin form \"Iudaeus\" (Djudeos), which has its root in the septuagint Koine Greek term, Ioudaioi.  Most other European languages retained the letter \"d\" in the word for Jew (Djudeo, Dzidov). In Hebrew intellectual tradition, recognition of God\u2019s Dominion is a fundamental human condition.  Failing to realize the semiotic opposition of Adam/Adon ('man'/'Lord', or, 'Master'), man falls short of developing his own \u2018I\u2019 and the \u201cimage of God\" (Elohim) within: thus people failing to recognize God\u2019s Dominion ultimately fall prey to human dominion.  The opposite of Hebrew monotheism is not simply polytheism, but also belief in a monarch (man) with unlimited sovereignty. A basic premise of Hebrew monotheism is that Creation was inaugurated by an initial act of free-will; \u2018love\u2019 in the language of Hebrew texts and the rabbis, by a supremely caring God.  This idea leads to two irreconcilable concepts of divine sovereignty.   1) In the pagan mind, \u201cThe Right of God\u2019s Sovereignty is derived from his Omnipotence.\u201d (see Leviathan XXXI, [187], p. 397.)  and 2) according to Hebrew texts, God\u2019s Sovereignty derives from the fact that God alone created and gave sustenance to everything - not because God is Almighty.  Thus, the primary objective of the story of Creation is not metaphysical, but, as Philo illustrates, to show \u201cthat the Father and Maker of the world was in the truest sense also its Lawgiver.\u201d  \u2018Might\u2019 does not bestow authority; only Creation, ex nihilo. \"The God of Abraham, Yitzhak and Yaqob\" - that is the conception of God harbored by Hebrews of the Babylonian Tradition.  Patriarch Abraham (Ibrahim) was a remarkable man - military leader, astronomer, teacher...but above all else he was the son of the Polytheistic high priest of Harran, Terah.  It was Abraham who broke the polytheistic cycle and asserted there can only be one God.   Hebrew monotheism hinges on the dialogue between man and master (Adam/Adon), in contradistinction to \"man and the image of God\" (Adam/Elohim).  Hakhamim taught that when Abraham realized that the stars in the sky were not deities, and there is \u201ca Master (Adon) and a God over them,\u201d he renounced idol worship and decided to take shelter \u201cunder the shade of his Master.\u201d The person taking offense was the king \u2014 not the priests.  In Midrash haGadol, Bereshit, Margulies (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 5727/ 1967), p. 205, and in Mishneh Torah \u2018Aboda Zara 1: 3 (l. 46), the one seeking to kill Abraham was the \u201cking.\u201d In the Guide for the perplexed Chapter III, 29, p. 375 (ll. 8\u2013 10) we learn that the king imprisoned Abraham and then expelled him because he was afraid that \u201che would wreck his policies.\u201d Hebrew monotheism demands monolatry.  This means that devotional practices are expressed through the fulfillment of the misvot (positive and negative deeds) established at Sinai-Moab.
