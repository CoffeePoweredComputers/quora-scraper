With a systematic lockdown and control of viral transmission there will be a good balance between infected patients inflow and treated patients outflow. With everyone developing herd immunity that virus won't be a big problem even if vaccine is not much effective. The number of cases count should remain low that is the agenda rightnow for india ",
