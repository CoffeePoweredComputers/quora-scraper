            "answer_text": "History, ideally, must be Objective. This has been horn-book doctrine way back college. Be objective, only facts facts facts. Narrate in the third person plural like a Loss Adjuster\u2019s report on the sinking or stranding of a ship where numbers of hands perished; or a fire accident adjuster\u2019s report; all facts but fully devoid of nary a tinge of emotion or involvement on a dozen roasted souls. One will be but a Narrator Only. Tacitus (great books, vol.14) started his Annals with a promise just to report, be as objective, he favors none. Until he reached the Nero era, where he became subjective against the Christians. Subjective-Objective is a balance a History writer must strive to achieve.This is easier said in a lecture-lectern where Theory abounds; but in the world of Practice the writer-narrator, like Tacitus, will soon take sides; after all, he is human and will have inclinations to one and indifference to another. His point of view is Subjectivity itself. Pick ten students; pick up one incidence they can visit (a fire) let them write a Report about it. How many Points of Views are there? Assign the same ten students to read and submit a paper on the Mamasapano encounter and you have Subjectivity and Objectivity clashing on. And your diet (economic level) will influence your line of approach. History, after all, is essentially People; possessed with pretensions to the Heavens but mired in Earth. Pinas History; read five (5) authors; all appears subjective (tell me I am wrong, please). One writer even wants to convert readers to the Left, that is the running undercurrent in his visit to the past. It seems Pinas cannot help but veer to the side of the subjective, simply because we are person-centered. The Facts (objective) become Subjective when it is processed in our system of thinking. But that is the Pinas. Go try change it; me? am planting coconuts, calamansi and coffee plus cacao, away from the realm of Theory and immersed in the land of Practice. That is a subjective/objective line. ",

            "answer_text": "By definition, all history is subjective, since someone has employed someone, to write that history. You write preferentially you are compensated, you don\u2019t at your peril! Hence, future investigative writers in a democratic society may find the \u201cwarts\u201d in earlier writings and seek to offer more objective views! ",
