            "answer_text": "As people, John and Richard were pretty unsavoury. Henry VIII started well and only became a tyrant midway through his reign, after which he certainly made us for it. Henry III strikes me as a nice, but ineffectual sort of chap and Charles was a product of his times whose biggest mistake was probably to believe his own hype. Of the five, Henry III and Charles unwittingly contributed to the growth of parliamentary democracy by failing to stand up to Simon De Montford and by winding up parliamentary respectively. In spite of themselves, they left a positive legacy. Dependent on your perspective, Henry VIII either freed England from the yoke of the church or he gave rise to the sectarianism which was so damaging in subsequent centuries. In each case, there\u2019s an argument that they left the country in a better place than they found it, although in Henry VIII\u2019s case, it\u2019d have been a tough job getting there. Richard might be an iconic figure but it\u2019s hard to see what he left behind. All of which leaves John. Granted, his reign saw Magna Carta. If I was feeling charitable, I could say that that puts him on a par with Charles, as someone whose objectionable behaviour made him a catalyst in the evolution of democracy. The difference is that Charles believed in the divine right of kings and acted accordingly-and probably wasn\u2019t even disproportionately tyrannical for the times-whereas John was a medieval gangster As king, he presided over the loss of most of our continental territories, got us made subject to a papal interdict and lost the Crown Jewels in the Wash. Worse, he was just as much of a failure as a human being. He rebelled against his father and brother, probably murdered a nephew who had a better claim to the throne and dumped his wife for a younger woman without even bothering to invent a church and change the course of ecclesiastical history. Even the Shakespeare play he inspired is so bad that nobody ever performs it. It has to be Johnny Softsword, a horrible person and a dreadful king. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on what you call 'worse', personally or what happened during their reigns. Henry 111 was crowned as a young boy and had little control over anything until years later, and then was pretty much not too interested in anything but his own architectural projects, and as mentioned before, he allowed a rudimentary parliament to gain more influence via Simon de Montfort's rebellion. However his Uncle Richard and father John had left the country virtually penniless since Richard bled it dry firstly to go on crusade and then to ransom him after he was captured on his way back. Richard did literally nothing for England but be a hero type for some as fighting was what kings did. John was a decent enough fighter on occasion but had all his continental territories rising up at more or less the same time and at the end of his life faced a French invasion backed by some of his own aristocracy. He was an able administrator and more interested in that than fighting, hence the chaos with the French he left for his son's guardians to take care of. Then again he probably didn't intend to die when his son was so young. The facts he divorced his first wife and married another woman can't be held against him ,lots of people did that if they could afford to and get it past the church. Neither was the fact the country faced an interdict; that happened quite a lot too through history, and to Henry V111 and Elixabeth 1 among others. Also primogeniture wasn't the law then, Richard designated John his heir, and his nephew Arthur had been fighting him (and besieging his own grandmother) so was a threat to the throne, which really didn't need a young stroppy King on it at that stage. John wasn't a very pleasant person but there's no proof he murdered Arthur and he did preside, albeit unwillingly, over Magna Carta. Henry V111 and Charles 1 were something else again; Henry has been discussed so much it would take hours to re-hash that. Charles was an unlucky King, and that's always a bad thing (for the King). He was unwillingly to bend at all in an age when so many things were being questioned. He was right in one thing, though. The court which tried him had no authority to do so. ",

            "answer_text": "England has had so many bad kings I restrict my own mental worst list to the ones who got deposed, which still leaves us with five. Based on this, I\u2019d have to say Charles I was the worst. That said, John I was lazy, one of the worst qualities in any monarch, and had a cruel streak a mile wide. Henry VIII caused centuries of domestic turmoil. You can draw a line between his claim to be King of Ireland and the Anglo-Irish conflicts of the \u201990s and today. Henry III was in his own way worse than John, although without the cruel streak. He gets exempted from most worst lists only due to being one of the few kings to be a good and loving parent, and building Windsor Castle. Richard the Lionheart, in my opinion, is not bad so as much not interested in England compared with his other dominions. If John\u2019s sin was sloth, Richard\u2019s was pride, and this is what caused the failure of the Crusades and Richard\u2019s capture, which prevented him from ever really succeeding as monarch. I\u2019d also like to nominate George IV for worst king. He may not have presided over any glaring foreign disasters like his father, but he is by far the most unlikable and contemptuous monarch I\u2019ve read about, and lacked even the personal ambitions or energy of other bad kings. Henry VIII at least knew his kingship was for more than funding expensive parties. ",

I admit not to know much about Charles I but he seemed ineffective more than anything. I loathe Henry VIII, a true tyrant who may have had up to 75,000 of his own subjects killed. He abolished the monasteries not because of their \u2018corruption\u2019 but so he could lay his mitts on the money\u2014which he blew totally. Richard Lionheart didn\u2019t give 2 hoots about England; he was all about war for the sake of war,and if the people were bled dry, so what. He was worse than ineffective. John, despite the rep, COULD be an able administrator but his own personality and chasing the baron\u2019s wives didn\u2019t help his case. He could be incredibly cruel\u2014starving prisoners to death was a specialty. Anyway\u2026I\u2019m going with \u2018my hero\u2019\u2014Henry the Big Fat Eighth ",

            "answer_text": "My first comments on this question is; which of these kings were English? Although both King John and King Richard were born in England neither of them, nor John\u2019s son Henry III, spoke English as a first language or could really be regarded as English. Henry IV is considered to be the first king of England (after Hastings) to speak English as his first language. King Charles was scotch being born in Dunfermline. So; by default King Henry VIII was the worst \u2013 and the only English King on the list. Going to the other side of the question as it was meant to be asked I will say King Charles, or as he was known at the time \u2018The Man of Blood\u2019 was the worst. By his attitudes, lies and deceit he started the English Civil Wars. There were three in total. The English Civil wars went on to engulf all parts of the British Isles and brought about the rise of Oliver Cromwell. A man who is still hated by many people. Figures for the total number of people killed in the three Civil Wars are hard to determine but I can easily see them being in the region of 250,000 or about 2.5% of the population ",

To illustrate how bad he was, the Magna Carta was created out of desperation, specifically to limit the powers of King John. He was ruining the country. Never before had a king\u2019s powers been limited but John was so bad it was either that or assassination. Knowing how many terrible kings there had been up to then, for him to be the first who\u2019s powers were limited, says a lot about how bad he was. It\u2019s one reason no King since has ever been named John ",
