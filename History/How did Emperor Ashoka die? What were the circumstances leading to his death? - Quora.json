            "answer_text": "Emperor Ashoka was the epitome of peace and non-violence. Kalinga war was the cause but the reason was a peaceful soul, his first wife. Before converting to Buddhism he was also called Chandashoka (the Cruel) and it is believed he had a place where he punished his offenders. (Ashoka Hell) Ashoka had fallen in love with Vidisha Devi a merchant's daughter on his visit to Ujjain. Vidisha was of the Sakya clan related to Buddha. She believed in Buddhism. He had first started to follow nonviolence when he solved the revolts there without violence on her condition on him when he asked for her hand in marriage and she had refused stating many reasons. When he was attacked and injured Vidisha had tended to him in the Buddhist monastery where he had courted her and they got married at Sanchi. When they returned to Pataliputra his family was against his marriage since she was a merchant's daughter and of a different caste and there problems were caused by his brother Sushim. Also she was pregnant at that time. Hence he returned back to Ujjain as a governor. After ruling many years peacefully Vidisha had given birth to Mahendra and Sanghamitra. Bindusar his father died and the fight for the Mauryan throne started again where Ashoka went back on the path of violence and war. Both of them were in Pataliputra. When Kalinga war started Ashoka had left for war even after her efforts to stop him and later Vidisha got the news of his brutality and cruelty in the war. Also that he had forcefully married another princess. She knew she had failed in her attempts to convert his path to Buddhism. Also Buddhists were strictly monogamous. She returned at once to Ujjain and lived life serving people as a firm Buddhist. After the war when he came back he read the letter she had left which said mainly \" Aryaputra, you have failed to keep up the promise you made to me before our marriage\" Ashoka realised what he had done and went observing mournfully the streets of the Kalinga kingdom seeing the destruction he had caused. The heap of dead bodies lying and the streams of blood flowing devastated him. Ashoka renounced violence and started to follow the path of Buddhism just as he knew Vidisha wanted him to. But even after his efforts to bring her back she never returned to Pataliputra. Instead she sent her children to live with him which consoled him for a while.  Askoka became known for his greatness and was called \"Devon ka priya\"- beloved of god, due to his symolic acts. Soon after, his son announced that he wanted to follow the path of Buddhism, become a Buddhist and live life the way his mother had taught him to in his childhood. He wanted to follow her path and travel all over the kingdom spreading Buddhism. Ashoka was miserable when he heard it but finally allowed him. Later his daughter announced the same and declared that she wanted to travel offshore to Sri Lanka and spread Buddhism.  Ashoka was shocked to think that his daughter would turn into a Buddhist and would go so far away from him. He refused initially but then yielded due to others requests and for Vidisha's sake. Life went on this way for Ashoka without his family and happiness. Not one day went on without him mourning for Vidisha. Same was her condition in Ujjain. Both loved each other so much that they pined for each other every day. After a little while he got the news that Vidisha had passed away. Life was nothing but a burden for Ashoka now. He provided a respectable death ceremonial for her and declared mourning period for the whole kingdom. He spread her greatness and built many monasteries, Buddhism schools, etc in her name. Ashoka then lived life as only a commoner for his people ruling them. He passed away soon not being able to bear the pain, separation and loneliness. Also many problems arose some due to his youngest wife. Ashoka died a natural death due to the sufferings caused by his beloved's seperation and death. ",

Legends say that during cremation, his body burned for seven nights and days. Emperor Ashoka Ashoka is such an evil king he killed lacs in war and then tried to turn into a Monk. Thus he is known as one of the most famous kings of Indian history. He first conquered as a ruthless ruler and then turned to Buddhism for peace and salvation. This unique way of his life made him more famous. He said I wouldn't be remembered as a cruel kind but as a peace loving and pathbreaking kings of any time. His move towards Buddhism encouraged the concurrent time to gradually move towards a peaceful movement in later times of his life. Ashoka is possibly the most famous emperor of ancient India who has achieved a universal and immortal fame for his stupendous achievements within the realms of warfare, politics, administration, architecture, social works, statecraft and religion. He's fondly appreciated using the titles Devanampiya (one that is dear towards the gods) and Priyadarsin (one that evokes affection in everybody). Consistent with some rare and weird types of deaths and mysteries are surrounding Ashoka\u2019s death. H.G. Wells talks of Ashoka Covering the amazing Emperor in the book The Outline of History, H.G. Wells states \u201cAmidst many rulers who come for this post in history. Their Majesties and graciousness and serenities and royal highnesses and so on, the Ashoka shines, and shines, almost alone, as a star\u201d, that is a rare testimony that attests the amazing achievements of Ashoka. Ashoka ascends the throne Amongst a stiff competition to capture the throne between brothers and sisters born to Bindusara through many queens, Ashoka took the throne by killing not under six of his siblings. He earned plenty of recognition and status paving his way to the throne as a sole contender. Through the personality and caliber though his father himself didn't want him around the throne. Ashoka\u2019s early existence The first life of Ashoka dedicated to expanding the empire with some wars. His ambition to create his empire one of the biggest on earth made him intensely pursue war. There were none to challenge his supremacy within the subcontinent. There are little opposition and threat from outside forces too. The functional level Within his empire there were efforts to wage an internal war which were crushed. Ashoka waged a self-declared war against Kalinga and other areas of today's Odisha and also the north seaside of Andhra Pradesh. This grave war found the deaths of approximately 100,000 soldiers and civilians as well as the deportation/removal of well over 150,000. When Ashoka stepped onto world of war field, the dead and mutilated physiques turning the forest into red and also the mourning cries from the grieving family completely shook him. He made the decision to forget about wars in existence and devoted the remainder of his life to rehearse and spread Buddhism. Ashoka Died Ashoka\u2019s last years were very troubled phase of his existence. While his sons and kids were distributing Buddhism, Ashoka was intrigued through the cruel functions of his more young wife Tishyaraksha who got Prince Kunala, the legal heir towards the throne blinded by the lady. Dying of Ashoka Ashoka wiped out Tishyaraksha and restored Kuala around the throne who had later been successful by Samprati. There have been absurd plays of jealousy among his spouses. Some accounts condition that by piercing a poisonous thorn inside, certainly one of his spouses destroyed the Bodhi tree that Ashoka was greatly devoted. The resulting mental agony was stated to caused Ashoka\u2019s death as he was 72 years of age. Legends say that during cremation, his body burned for seven nights and days.
