That made the term \u201cNazi\u201d popular among its critics (who then spread it abroad) and unpopular among the Nazis. The OED simply says that the Nazis avoided calling themselves Nazis, though, not that they hated it. I couldn\u2019t find any evidence that they passed laws the term or crushed anyone who used it, which I imagine would be their response if it really bothered them. ",

That\u2019s not to say it was favoured as it was favoured, although the he NSDAP briefly adopted the designation \"Nazi\" an an attempt to avoid derogatory references by opponents. However, that rather failed and they did tend to avoid the term in any official party sense. Of course, it became increasingly used as a derogatory terms by exiles from the regime as the party came to power and then progressed through the war. ",
