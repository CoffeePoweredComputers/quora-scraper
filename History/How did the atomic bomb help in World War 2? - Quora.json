            "answer_text": "Possibly ended it. I say possibly as no one knows for sure. Imperial Japan was beaten cut off surrounded. America was bombing it at will and posed to invade. As was the USSR. Japan had been trying to talk peace for a year or so. Though their ideas of just keeping their gains and nothing more. Were bonkers. Still the high command thought one huge battle could give them peace with dignity. The nukes gave them an excuse to quit as they changed everything. Still there was a coup attempt to keep fighting . Did they quit as the Ussr entered the war or because of the nukes? No one knows for sure as they both happened at the same time. ",
