            "answer_text": "Phossy jaw refers to a condition that occurred in workers, primarily women, who worked in match factories. In those days, white phosphorus was used to make matches. This is highly toxic. (Today we use red phosphorus, which is much safer.) Phosphorus is a component of bone. The jaw is a bone with an incredibly high turnover rate, due to its constant use. People with phossy jaw would experience progressive damage to the jawbone due to their exposure to white phosphorus. In severe cases, the lower jaw would literally be destroyed entirely. ",
