            "answer_text": "Once again, I\u2019ve descended to Wikipedia. Basileus - Wikipedia Titles are problematic in any case, and I don\u2019t recall Achilles as being described as anything but swift of foot, at least before his name. One bit from Wikipedia: The word can be contrasted with wanax, another word used more specifically for \"king\" and usually meaning \"High King\" or \"overlord\". With the collapse of Mycenaean society, the position of wanax ceases to be mentioned, and the basileis (the plural form) appear the topmost potentates in Greek society. In the works of Homer wanax appears, in the form \u00e1nax, mostly in descriptions of Zeus (\u00e1nax andr\u014dn te the\u014dn te, \"king of men and of the gods\") and of very few human monarchs, most notably Agamemnon. Otherwise the term survived almost exclusively as a component in compound personal names (e.g., Anaxag\u00f3ras, Pleisto\u00e1nax) and is still in use in Modern Greek in the description of the an\u00e1ktoron/an\u00e1ktora (\"[place or home] of the \u00e1nax\"), i.e. of the royal palace. The latter is essentially the same word as  wa-na-ka-te-ro, wan\u00e1kteros, \"of the wanax/king\" or \"belonging to the wanax/king\", used in Linear B tablets to refer to various craftsmen serving the king (e.g. the \"palace\", or royal, spinner, or the ivory worker), and to things belonging or offered to the king (javelin shafts, wheat, spices, precincts etc.). Most of the Greek leaders in Homer's works are described as basile\u00eds, which is conventionally rendered in English as \"kings\". However, a more accurate translation may be \"princes\" or \"chieftains\", which would better reflect conditions in Greek society in Homer's time, and also the roles ascribed to Homer's characters. Agamemnon tries to give orders to Achilles among many others, while another basileus serves as his charioteer. His will, however, is not to be automatically obeyed. In Homer the wanax is expected to rule over the other basileis by consensus rather than by coercion, which is why Achilles proudly and furiously rebels (the central theme of the Iliad) when he perceives that Agamemnon is unjustly bossing him around.

            "answer_text": "A complecated subject in Greek. In Greek there are really many words that can express the kind of leadership. Greeks liked to differentiate the types of leadership. IGETIS, IGEMONAS, ARHONTAS, VASILEUS, ANAX, TYRANNOS, etc. ANAX is a more general word that relates a person to leadership or \u2014-take care i will make my own word\u2014- leaderSHEEP. ANAX is used also among other situations to call the sons and the brothers of a King or a leader. VASI-LEUS(two words) is a more spesific word for leadership. It means that a person is the base( VASI) of the SUN(ILEUS). A statue of Isis can give a good example of the meaning of the word. see foto. (VASILEUS is a complicated word to explain).  In the begining the leaders of the people were called Vasileus. Those leaders were a mix of human and dragons(in Greek is ment the word snake). So the first King(vasileus) was Kekropas the First. Vasilia as a form of leadership ends after the king Pandion. After that the normal Humans starts to govern and with them it starts the era of ARHONTES. THIS FACT IS A MAIN ASPECT OF THE GREEK HISTORY. (The mix dragon+Human is called in Greek GIGENIS/HTHONIOS/AUTOHTHON and it means in English indigenous and this word in its self is derived from the first mentioned word Gigenis) So in Greece For every type of beings(genes, DNA with todays terms) that governed, existed a different title. That it is why i said that it is complicated to explain the real differences between the word ANAX and VASILEUS. *All facts that are presented here are exctracted from the Greek Mythology and the texts in Greek Philosophy. Meaning that are not my fantasy. ! ** Be carefull not to consider Alexander the Great as a Ginenis because he was called Vasileus. Vasileus at his time ment the Enlightened. ",

            "answer_text": "The distinction between both titles lies in the in pre-historic origins of the Mycenaean \u201cwanax\u201d, which besides coming to be a sort of overlord over vassal like, smaller chieftains, \u201cbasileis\u201d; was also thought to originally be the chief of the priestly class responsible for public rites and sacrifices. The wanax was originally a priest king, or chief priest, that later on became more of a chief warlord. The wanax had higher recognized status because they were also still the ceremonial chief of of the public rites, even though the priest class were, by the late bronze age, already a distinct class. Also the wanax had gained the right to bind lower chieftains into pledges of loyalty, and provision of troops in any military pursuits, foreign expeditions, or response against outside enemies. The position of the wanax though still had a connotation of being a bridge between the people and the divine, securing prosperity and well-being on their behalf. This title fell out of use after the late bronze age, Agean collapse, and was replaced fully by \u201cbaselious\u201d, when the functions of the ruler became fully military and political, and separate from the functions of a priest class, and each region had become autonomous from any sort of overarching warlord.
