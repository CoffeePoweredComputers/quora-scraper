            "answer_text": "Basque and Portuguese fishing boats had been working the Grand Banks off Newfoundland for decades before 1492 and were perfectly well aware that there was land there. Probably they made landfall from time to time. Very likely Giovanni Caboto knew exactly where he was going. If Columbus hadn\u2019t returned from his first voyage, what would have happened? A number of Spanish academic geographers would have said, \u201cWe told you so.\u201d;North America would have been settled by Europeans before Central or South America;The Spanish and Portuguese would probably have staked claims to land in northern North America during the 16th century as well as the French and English;Various European adventurers would have found it a bit crowded in Canada and New England and moved south;The outcome in the long run would have been much the same, although the various occupying powers would be arranged differently on the map.",

            "answer_text": "The question is not whether or not the Americas would have been discovered, but rather when. One of the obstacles is that Columbus was wrong. His calculations about the size of the Earth were too small. Most people qualified to have an opinion believed (correctly) that a western route to Asia would have been too far a voyage to be practical, so the Spanish crown\u2019s sponsorship of Columbus\u2019s voyage was taking a chance that shouldn\u2019t have paid off, and probably wouldn\u2019t have if the New World hadn\u2019t unexpectedly been there. But other explorers might have found the New World unexpectedly. For example, sailors working on routes to get around Africa were already experimenting with routes taking them well to the west in search of favorable winds and currents. If someone had gone far enough or been blown somewhat off course, they might have inadvertently discovered Brazil. It\u2019s also quite possible that fishermen, sailing farther and farther west to supply demand for salt cod, would have eventually repeated the Viking discovery of Canada. Indeed, it\u2019s been suggested that Basque fishermen had already done so and kept it a secret so that nobody could horn in on fish drying camps they are suspected to have set up there. So, then, the New World would remain a secret from the Old for a while longer, but at some unpredictable point in the future, there\u2019d be contact. ",
