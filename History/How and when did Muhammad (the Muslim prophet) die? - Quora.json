            "answer_text": "Muhammad died in 632 A.D. He died as a result of being poisoned following his attack upon and conquest of the Jewish settlement of Khaibar. About 2 month before his attack on Khaibar Muhammad failed in an attempt to go to Mecca. This failure resulted in the Treaty of Hudaybiyya with the Meccans. He returned humiliated in the eyes of the Meccans and in the minds of his people. To lift their defeated spirit, Muhammad told his followers that the events at Hudaybiyya were really a victory. In fact, another convenient \"revelation\" was given to Muhammad as proof that it really was a victory (Sura 48:1). However, Allah was not able to deliver the Meccan's goods as booty, so Muhammad told his followers that they were going to attack and plunder the weaker Jewish settlement of Khaibar. About 6 weeks later Muhammad led his army and attacked the Jews while they were on their way to work on their date palms. Khaibar was a settlement defended by a number of forts spread apart from each other. One by one Muhammad's army took the forts. Finally, the last few surrendered to him. Muhammad had several of the leaders of the Jewish settlement beheaded, one leader (Kinana) was tortured to reveal where buried treasure was hidden. Then when Kinana was near death, Muhammad commanded that he be beheaded. Many of the women and children were enslaved. Muhammad even took the most beautiful woman for himself and married her (Safiyah). Some of Khaibar's residents made a deal with Muhammad. Instead of enslaving them, which would leave the rich orchards of Khaibar to go untended and unproductive, the Jews would give Muhammad and the Muslims 1/2 of all of what they produced. Muhammad accepted the deal, with the stipulation that they could be expelled at his slightest whim. Years later, Umar expelled the last remaining Jews from Khaibar. Immediately following the conquest of Khaibar, a Jewish woman prepared a dinner for Muhammad and some of his men. Unknown to the Muslims was that she had put a poison into the lamb (some say goat) that was served at dinner. Muhammad ate some of the poisoned lamb and died. ",

            "answer_text": "Let the Islamic texts themselves prove Md. was poisoned to death. [Bukhari's Hadith 5.713:] Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet in <<<<<his ailment in which he died>>>>, used to say, \"O 'Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison.\" This sahi hadith tells us the ailment due to which he died was from the poison he unknowingly ate. Now let's see if Md. died of fever. [Ibn Sa'd page 294] Umm Bishr [the mother of the Muslim man who also died eating poison], came to the prophet during his illness and said, \"O apostle of Allah! I never saw fever like it in any one.\" The prophet said to her, \"Our trial is double and so our reward [in heaven], is double. What do the people say about it [his illness]?\" She said, \"They say it is pleurisy.\" Thereupon the apostle said, \"Allah will not like to make His apostle suffer from it (pleurisy) because it indicates the possession of Satan, <<<<but (my disease is the result of) the morsel that I had taken along your son. It has cut my jugular vein.>>>>>\" Here we see Md. himself testifying that it's not fever, but the poison that's killing him. There are many more verses from islamic texts, just like these. So why was Md. poisioned? The jews reasoned that if Md. was actually a prophet, god will save him from the poison - and thus gave him poisoned meat as a test. Md. failed it (and those jews were killed, obviously). All cited in the auhentic hadiths. Moses and Jesus knew of their death beforehand; Paul had a poisonous snakebite but didn't die; Md. had no clue of his death till the poison got in well. Even angel gabriel prayed for Md., but Allah's will was to let him die of poisoning. And why is Md.'s testimony of feeling as if his aorta was being cut, important? The Quran warned Muhammad not to change the so-called revelation or invent sayings since Allah would punish him: And when Our signs are recited to them, clear signs, those who look not to encounter Us say, 'Bring a Koran other than this, or alter it.' Say: 'It is not for me to alter it of my own accord. I follow nothing, except what is revealed to me. <<<Truly I fear, if I should rebel against my Lord, the chastisement of a dreadful day.'>>> Surah 10:15 Arberry it is the speech of a noble Messenger. It is not the speech of a poet (little do you believe) nor the speech of a soothsayer (little do you remember). A sending down from the Lord of all Being. Had he invented against Us any sayings, We would have seized him by the right hand, then <<<We would surely have cut his life-vein.>>>> Surah 69:40-46 Arberry Isn't it an interesting coincidence that Md. died feeling his life vein being cut - just as the Quran warned as punishment for changing Allah's words? And if Muslims still think that the onoy reason Md. couldn't have died of poisoning is that people can never kill a true prophet, the rightful conclusionnshould be that Md. was a false prophet. He didn't pass the poison test of the jews and died in exactly the same way the Quran said. ",
