            "answer_text": "Mental health. A lot of people believe Black woman are \u201cstrong\u201d. Physically and mentally stronger than most. Even the military at one point was trying to study our social networks in order to deal with the suicide rates in the military because I think Black women are still the least likely group in the US to commit suicide. I feel because of this not only do others disregard our mental health, so do we ourselves because we buy into those stereotypes. Not to mention culturally, one of the greatest insults in the Black community is to have something wrong with you. \u201cOh, he/she is CRAZY!\u201d I remember in school that was one of the worst things to be accused of, not being right in the head. That could be for a host of stupid reasons, you\u2019re not loud enough, you don\u2019t talk a lot, you have anxiety\u2026 so just think about serious mental issues, how people will talk. Parents are often times unwilling to even talk about it, although times are changing. My parents finally started listening to me and that was the result of my grandma finally getting the help she needed to deal with her own mental health issues. That\u2019s what on my mind right now, there\u2019s a lot more but I\u2019m going to leave it to others to speak on them. ",
