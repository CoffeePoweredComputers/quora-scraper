            "answer_text": "One of my relatives was still a soldier in France clearing up the battlefields until 1924, when the last soldiers left France finally after \u201cfinishing\u201d??? ,!!!!! the clean up operations\u2026.. By hand and shovel basically\u2026.and not very well at all\u2026. But the battlefields were vast areas, filled with rotting bodies, poisonous sludge and bomb filled pools of foul water, rats and disease. Many underground shelters, dug outs, trenches and other things, including vast dumps or heaps of artillery shells, got just buried, filled in with earth, boxes of mortar rounds, grenades bullet clips and bombs buried or were thrown into trenches and then buried in them\u2026wooden boxes of bullets and machine gun Ammunition, mortar bombs and grenades, all rotting by now, and LETHAL\u2026.. In some places, German or British Engineers dug tunnels, mines, that were then never finished, and left filled with demolition explosives\u2026..as battle moved on farther up the lines of trenches\u2026.they were filled in, forgotten after the war, and remain rotting, polluting water, fields soil and vegetation today\u2026.  British Heavy Artillery being moved. It was either the giant tractor or the railway nothing else could move these Iron giants.\u2026 In one place (at least one!) in Belgium, an abandoned forgotten Military underground Mineing tunnel, left behind when the course of the battle changed, was recently rediscovered by using old wartime maps; It lies 80 feet beneath a farm barn on the MESSINES RIdge, the site of a great WW1 battle. The explosives are believed to be around 50,000 pounds of TNT. Enough to destroy an entire town\u2026 8000 Metres of Military secret underground Mine tunnels were built, a full 18 months before the Military offensive began. British miners dug tunnels along the Ypres Salient towards the German trenches on the Messines Ridge.  Ypres Salient was a bulge in the British and French lines, where you could be fired on from the left, right or even from behind, a very nasty place to have to fight. A underground minieing plan was initiated to try to break the murderous deadlock at that point of the front lines. The father of the writers English step father, (Grandfather) fought in the Royal Engineers at Ypres, and took part in the building of some of these mining tunnels himself. He survived the war to become the towns local chimnee sweep. Below. Wartime map of Military trenches and positions at \u201cMessinnes\u201d.  Lines of trenches crossed from Belgium right as far as Switzerland during World War One. battle moved along and up and down them, with a great many offensives, attacks, counter attacks Artillery Salvos and barrages for years on end. The sites , often forgotten and now near to houses, remain littered and dangerously contaminated in certain areas. Unfortuneately for several farmers today, their homes and farms and livlihoods are all placed 80 to 100 feet above several of these deadley old explosive tunnels. And they are now extremely old and rotting, and could be triggered by a lightning strike or internal instability at any It is a bitter legacy left behind from a war almost a century ago now\u2026.and there is NO SAFE way to clear up or remove the danger\u2026. The Infamous German \u201cParis\u201d rail gun. it could fire a shell 75 Miles.  Special \u201cRifleing\u201d on the gun barrel produced a shell stability and accurracey over long range. The secrets of the design were revolutionary for its day, and after the war, the giant gun \u201cdissappeared\u201d. It is thought it may remain walled up inside one of the old allied military railway tunnels somewhere under Europe. Technology was only rediscovered again similar to it in the latter years of the 20th Century. EXPLOSION IN FRANCE HEARD AS FAR AWAY AS DOWNING STREET IN LONDON Just for ONE Campaign of battle (there were many others !) 25 Military Mine tunnels were dug out, and many were fillled with explosives. Five however were not used, and left abandoned. One tunnel is known to still contain around 20,000 pounds of high explosives\u2026and it is now unstable, rotting away\u2026.anything could happen. One explosion during the war killed 10,000 German soldiers in one go. CONTINUED RISK OF EXPLOSION Old explosives are highly unstable, can go off at any moment for the least obvious of reasons. One of the four unused mines exploded after 38 years in 1955, believed to have been triggered by a lightening strike. On June 7th,1917, 19 of the mines were detonated within half a minute. When the explosions took place more than a million pounds of explosives were backed into the underground chambers along seven miles dug by the miners in an attack that killed 6,000 German troops. The bang was heard as far away as Downing Street in London, buildings within a 30-mile radius shook, and even seismographs in Switzerland were able to register a small earthquake.  Wartime underground Military Mines or old tunnels, can be full of old rotten bombs and boxes of explosives\u2026.just waiting to go off\u2026.many were back filled by engineers after the war but were never properly or safely emptied of their high explosive contents\u2026. He was out there working with other soldiers in France, taking away and destroying what could be found and cleaned up long years after fighting had stopped and the others had long gone back home\u2026.  French Field Guns in action during the battle of Verdun. However, this does not mean the battlefields were remotely safe, every year in Northern France someone is killed, dead, out in the fields, walking or touching over abandoned WW1 Munitions. Ploughing the fields there is still inherently fatally dangerous too\u2026.each and every year rusty and unstable wartime ammunition \u201cfloats back\u201d to the top again from being buried nearly a century ago.  Above. This is only a very little of what can be found on a walk through the Verdun Forest or countryside \u2026.this lethal lot is from World War One. 100 years after that terrible \u201cGreat War\u201d ended, Europes former battlefields remain terribly poisoned, and poluuted, and very dangerous places.  The problem is particularly bad in the Alsace, Liege and Belgium border areas, and Verdun. But in this area of northeastern France, and across the border into Belgium, the fallout from the fighting still lingers. Farmers and hikers around Verdun say they regularly find discarded artillery shells and grenades, vestiges of the war that are still potentially lethal.  100 years after the last shot was fired, there remains at least 100 to 300 years worth of dirty, dangerous work to finally remove to a safe level all the old rusting, decaying, rotting and unstable bombs, grenades, Mortars and Artillery Shells leftover from World War One. In one giant hangar, a team of five men work permanently, defusing or neutralising unexploded Poison Gas Bombs , each years more are found and brought there\u2026.the pile of bombs is enormous and will take a century to get rid off\u2026.if they stop finding even more tomorrow and next year and the year after next\u2026. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many I find sometimes,\u201d said Roland Dabit, a resident of the nearby hamlet of Somogneux. Below. Millions and Millions of shells got fired during WW1; the empty Brass metal cartridge cases were to be taken back and re used again\u2026.here is just ONE point for shell case pickup.   Below. English and French Factory workers produced MILLIONS fo Artillery exploding shells of all types and sizes.  Below. Ammunition was often delivered by small gauge Military trains specialy laid down for the task. Giant \u201cDumps\u201d of Artillery and other Ammunition were everywhere up and down Europes trench networks in WW1 many were simply buried and forgotten\u2026.  Now just \u201cimagine\u201d whats going to happen when the poor person who wants to build a house here, starts useing the Digger to trech the foundations?!!! Clearing unexploded ordinance factors strongly in the cost and dealys, associatted with building new houses in this region.  Narrow gauge secret Military railways were built by Army engineers all across the battlefields. Sometimes too the trains full of high explosives, would be hit by enemy fire or have an acciddent and literaly explode into vapour\u2026. The countryside around Verdun, a monstrous battle of attrition, and other areas of France,are still very heavily contaminated by the left over decaying, unstable munitions from the 1914 to 1918 \u201cGreat War\u201d. Below; Every Artillery Gun needed a Dump or supply \u201cheaps\u201d of Shells to sustain firing barrages. Heaps and heaps of Shells and bombs were simply left behind, abandoned in the mud\u2026.each year some of these re surface, with fatal consequences for some people.  Above. just one, relatively \u201csmall\u201d Artillery Ammunition storage Dump \u201csomewhere\u201d in France.WW1. There were hundreds and hundreds of far bigger Ammo dumps than this one in these battlefields\u2026many are still un accounted for\u2026..a ticking time bomb beneath the French countryside\u2026. And regularly they still are killing people. \u201cEven in the forest. How many are there in the forest? How many? Believe me, when we go mushroom-picking, I see a hundred shells,\u201d Dabit told Reuters. Farmer Alain Doyen says that after tilling the earth in his fields, he often finds old German shells. \u201cIt is a bit scary sometimes because when you are in the middle of the field you don\u2019t feel like touching it,\u201d Doyen said. \u201cIt\u2019s better not to leave them in the middle so I try to move them to the side.\u201d  Even today some parts of the lines of old Military trenches survive\u2026 The bomb clearance unit from the nearby city of Metz has its hands full responding to the numerous calls from residents and collects some 40 tonnes of ammunition each year.  Its not what you \u201csee\u201d its what you cant \u201csee\u201d buried in the mud and in the forests\u2026  Zone Rouge No one takes a walk in this bit if they have a brain\u2026.and intend to KEEp it on their shoulders\u2026 A decayed Box of Mills Bombs, (greades). Just ONE is enough to KILL\u2026..dont for Gods sake set off the entire box !!!!!!  The \u201cPlaz De Gaz\u201d The water in the area was found to contain toxic levels of arsenic that were 300 times above the tolerated amount and abnormally high lead levels were recorded in some animals, particularly in the livers of hunted wild boars. Can you smell Almonds? Or a strange unusual smell a bit like Garlic? RUN LIKE HELL !!!!!! IT IS POISON GAS !!!!!  It is named this because people, hunters who worked here or lived nearby fell sick and died\u2026finaly it was abandoned\u2026.the reason? Poison gas is leaking up through the ground from wartime Poison gas Ammunitions, left buried at wars end in 1918.  The RED ZONES are DEADLEY Dangerous areas you MUST NOT EVER GO INTO THEM. Yellow there are still unexploded bombs but less dense in number (!!) Green and Blue are relatively \u201csafe\u201d (But DONT RELY ON IT MATE !) old ammo is still found there too\u2026. Alarming amounts of lead debris scattered by shrapnel were also left in place, contaminating the soil with non biodegradable lead, mercury and zinc likely to remain for at least 10,000 years to come. Farmers in less dangerous re-populated \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cblue zones\u201d, still hit shells every year, exploding their tractors and narrowly escaping death by the remains of a hundred year old war. In Verdun, there are road signs to indicate a dumping grounds for farmers to leave the shells they\u2019ve plowed up on their land to be collected by authorities. Below This years Farm \u201charvest\u201d from the 1914 to 1918 War\u2026.very often the bombs explode underneath the farmers tractor, sometimes they are killed because of this\u2026  Even now, almost a century after the last shot got fired, the Great War is still killing persons in France\u2026. Every day a two-person team patrols the Verdun sector looking for shells, some 1 million of which were fired by the Germans in one of the first salvos of the conflict alone. The battle of Verdun lasted 300 days\u2026. from 21 February to 18 December 1916.  Above. French soldiers attack Germans at verdun. Verdun was a veritable charnel house of dead bodies and unexploded bombs\u2026.long before battle was finished\u2026. The construction of new houses regularly reveals large quantities of shells during excavation, a delay often taken into consideration when building a new house in the sector.  Thousands of guns fired thousands if not Millions of Artillery shells. many still poison and litter dangerously the French countryside today\u2026  Some Guns were massive and the shells enormous ! Below WW1 French railway mounted gun; it could drop explosive shells on targets thirty Miles away. All these metal giants needed a huge stock pile of Shells. After the war ended many of the shells were simply left behind and quietly \u201cburied\u201d !  \u201cToday we need more space, we build new houses, and what happens? We stir up the earth. When you stir up the earth, you keep the legacy of this war which are the shells, the grenades and the mortars,\u201d Momper said. \u201cSo in this sense, the war is not over,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think, in the area where we are now, it will continue for 100 or 200 years.\u201d Although reckless inhabitants sometimes try to destroy the ammunition themselves - one local man used improvised means last month to explode a 155mm shell in the forest - Momper recommends that the bomb clearance unit be notified and the dangerous work be carried out by professionals.  Shell pocked ground, still visible one hundred years after the final battles finished in 1918. Don\u2019t disturb the soil\u2026Death still lives here for the unwary unlucky enough to touch old ammunition laying on or very close to the surface\u2026  Below In 1918\u2026.   Dead Soldiers were just left on the battlefields impossible to then bury\u2026.they too are still buried many of them there\u2026.. Precise figures on the number of deaths due to exploded shells are hard to come by, but two experts from the Metz unit were killed in 2007 after a shell they were transporting detonated. Momper said that given the number of munitions that remain in the area and are yet to be discovered, \u201cit\u2019s almost impossible that nothing will happen.\u201d  Verdun Forest then and now\u2026. \u201cSomeone said once, \u2018the bomb does its own thing\u2019. In normal conditions if it\u2019s in a certain position, you can carry it around taking a number of precautions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might be able to carry a million of them but the next one might explode.\u201d Dont go souvenir hunting or picking for Mushrooms here\u2026.pick one of these and they will never find the body\u2026.  Decaying and highly explosive dangerous old wartime ordinance. It litters Miles and Miles of the French countryside from World War One down to this day\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "With extreme caution. There are areas in France called red zone where the public still shouldn\u2019t go because of unexploded ordinances. Governments, farmers, and locals did their best to clean up their properties, clear weapons and bodies from battlefields, but there was many areas where they had to let be to the elements. some of the ground is toxic, and there are still thousands and thousands of soldiers buried deep under the ground of these battlefields, because it was too dangerous to recover their bodies. Today, we still uncover complete skeletons, guns, cookware, munitions, all kinds of things. Essentially very slowly and cautiously, some places were still being rebuilt and cleared by the time world war 2 came around. Imagine that stress on a town in France? There were 7 or so villages and also some battlefields in France and a couple in Germany that were leveled so badly due to the war that they were left to the elements, and basically given up on because of the destruction and potential toxicity. There is an insane statistic in the red zone that something like 90%+ of plants die due to toxic soil. ",
