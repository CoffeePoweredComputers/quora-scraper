            "answer_text": "\u201cThe king of Kabul was not the man to shirk from an adventure of any kind; the wilder and the more daring it seemed, the better he liked it.\u201d -Stanley Lane-Poole  The First Emperor of the Mughal Empire Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur The Emperor Babur is perhaps the most captivating figure in oriental history. He was a descendant of both Chingis Khan and Timur the Lame. In his 48 years of life Babur achieved more than most people do even in 90. He was a remarkable man with many virtues and few, if any, vices. He was a skilled archer and swordsman. He possessed incredible strength and stamina; he could run along the battlements of a castle with a man under each arm and not even break a sweat. He also swam across every river he came upon, including the great Ganges. Physical strength and skill at arms, however, were common traits in Babur\u2019s times. What made him truly great was his sophisticated and cultured personality. He was fluent in both Persian and Turkish. Along with being a fine warrior he was also an accomplished poet. He delighted in improvising a quartrain on the spot, quoting the Persian classics or singing a good song. Babur was also quick in perception, a devoted lover of nature and a curious observer. His character was fresh and buoyant, brimming with hope, courage and resolve along with being warm and friendly. However, by far his greatest virtue was his undying resolve. He was a man of iron will who absolutely never gave up. He had some very dark days in his life, times when he walked barefoot through gloomy vales, deserted by all but the most loyal of his followers. But never once did he lose hope. Three times he attacked the great city of Samarkand and three times he succeeded only to be pushed out again. But even then, instead of resigning himself to ruling the small kingdom of Kabul, he turned his eyes to the rich lands of India. Five times he raided it and the fifth raid became a conquest. In three historic battles Babur simultaneously reduced Northern India to submission and secured his place amongst the great generals of Asia. Babur\u2019s most enduring legacy, after the Mughal empire of course, was his Memoirs. Pages of praise can be written for them and they still won\u2019t do justice to this masterpiece. Written in Babur\u2019s simple yet pure and elegant prose, they relate the tale of this adventurous prince. They record his triumphs and defeats, moments of happiness and tragedy and much much more. All in all, they deserve their position as a masterpiece of literature. Many people will claim Akbar or even Alauddin Khilji were greater than Babur due to their extensive and radical reforms but that is just a matter of opinion. I, for one, have yet to see a monarch in whom bravery, physical strength, ambition, skill at arms, military genius, intellect, sophistication of personality, elegance, charm, charisma, justness, mastery of literature and an iron resolve were combined in equal parts as they were combined in Babur.

            "answer_text": "It has to be Henry V of England. Henry was born in August of 1386 (or 1387) at Monmouth Castle on the Welsh border. His father, Henry of Bolingbroke, deposed his cousin Richard II in 1399. With Henry IV\u2019s ascension, the younger Henry became Prince of Wales and spent eight years leading armies against the rebellious Welsh ruler Owain Glyndwr. In 1403 Henry fought alongside his father against their former ally Henry \u201cHotspur\u201d Percy in the Battle of Shrewsbury. During the battle, the younger Henry was hit in the face with an arrow but was saved by the daring surgical removal of the arrowhead. Henry was making demands of France\u2014first for the return of Aquitaine to England in fulfillment of a 1360 treaty, then for a 2-million-crown payment, then for the king\u2019s daughter Catherine\u2019s hand in marriage. In 1415 Henry gathered his army and sailed for France. Henry abandoned plans to attack Paris after the victorious but costly siege of Harfleur, in which one-third of his army died of dysentery. On October 25, 1415\u2014the feast day of St. Crispin\u2014Henry\u2019s army defeated a much larger French force at Agincourt. Henry\u2019s army of about 6,000 battled up to 30,000 French soldiers, who were forced by the terrain to advance in narrow formations that made them easy targets for Henry\u2019s archers. The French advance was impeded by mud and their own mounting dead. All the while, Henry kept control of the battle, encouraging his troops and fighting hand-to-hand. After the English took so many prisoners that Henry worried they might overpower their guards, he violated the rule of war by ordering their immediate execution. All told, the French lost as many as 7,000, while the English dead numbered at most a few hundred. Though not militarily decisive, the victory at Agincourt won Henry important allies and gained him a hero\u2019s welcome on his return to England. Henry V: Second French Campaign, Marriage, Death In 1417 Henry attacked France again, capturing Caen and Normandy and taking Rouen after a six-month siege in which he refused to aid 12,000 expelled residents left to starve between the city walls and the English lines. In 1420 the French king Charles VI sued for peace. The Treaty of Troyes placed Henry in control of France for the remainder of Charles VI\u2019s life and promised that the English line would succeed to the French throne. Henry married Charles\u2019 daughter Catherine. The royal couple arrived in England in 1421, and their only son, the future Henry VI, was born soon after. Henry returned to France to deal with territories allied with the disinherited dauphin, the future Charles VII. In May of 1422 Henry won his last victory in the Siege of Meaux. He died on August 31, 1422, of battlefield dysentery. Henry V: Legacy Henry VI was less than a year old when he took the English and French thrones. By the time he was deposed in 1461, he had lost most of the French territories his father had won and England was riven by the War of the Roses. In 1599 Shakespeare wrote his \u201cHenry V,\u201d including the St. Crispin\u2019s Day \u201cband of brothers\u201d speech by which the eponymous king is most frequently remembered.
