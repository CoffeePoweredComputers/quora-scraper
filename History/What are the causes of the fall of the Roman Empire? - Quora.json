            "answer_text": "Size. The Roman Senate was essentially a municipal council and Roman state institutions of the republic were essentially created for governing the city and its surrounding lands. After the Punic wars, the Roman state got way too big for the antiquated Republican institutions to govern. The senate governed provinces through appointed proconsuls, who held dictatorial power within their designated provinces, and this method of government proved to be ineffective.Professionalization of the army. During the early and mid republic, roman soldiers were citizen farmers, who fought for the state as their civic duty. In addition, all the conquered areas had to provide a certain number of troops for the roman army as a part of their alliance with the roman state. These soldiers were loyal to the state. With Marian reforms, the job of a soldier became paid and landless poor were given the opportunity to enlist. The weird quirk of this system was that the state didn\u2019t actually pay the soldiers, the soldiers were paid by their general, and much of the pay was war booty, so the soldiers were loyal to their general rather than the state. These generals then became more powerful than the senate, because they had armies and the senate didn\u2019t.Civil wars between Rome\u2019s generals were bound to lead to an eventual winner, who would take power by virtue of conquest essentially, and this person was very likely to consolidate power. Just the nature of civil wars, that they usually end with a winner, meant that this winner would end up holding all the power, and from there it is a very small step to consolidating and perpetuating that power. The civil wars of the republic were a direct precursor of the Roman empire and the winner of civil wars became the emperor.",

            "answer_text": "Unconstitutional arrangements and powers - Men like Sulla, Caesar and perhaps most Pompey eroded the constitutional limits and consistently pushed the boundaries as to what was acceptable. For example, Pompey was able to refuse to disband his army in defiance of official orders, Sulla was able to march on Rome itself and conduct legitimised purges in the name of \u201cdefending the Republic\u201d, and finally Caesar was able to warp the dictatorship from a 6-month office to one held for life (this opened the way to single-man rule). See the corruption of the Senatus Consultum Ultimum for examples of Rome\u2019s constitutional and legal decline. One must remember that at all times the senate possessed no actual powers beyond advisory and influence, thus they could not directly challenge individuals.Privatised military forces - Ever since Marius expanded military recruitment to the landless, Rome was facing issues with conflicting loyalties among the troops. Previously the troops had been farmers who had land they could typically count on for survival. However as they returned throughout the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, they often found the rich landowners and elite had swept up their farms into their own private holdings and estates. Thus the state was forced to turn to the landless for manpower. Following retirement/disbandment, these soldiers had to be rewarded for their service, typically in the form of a land settlement to set them up in the agrarian society upon which Rome was built. These men had to rely on their commanders to survive and receive their settlement. This led to them going along with their commanders ambitious and Machiavellian tactics and plans (these men were also often the same individuals pushing constitutional boundaries), and was why Rome was able to fight so many civil wars in the 1st century BC.Elite apathy and arrogance - the elite towards the end of the Republic refused to resolve the problems facing the state. Problems often that they were causing, such as seizing land and thus disrupting recruitment for the Roman war machine, and allowing personal political disputes to come before patriotic duty. The state had always swung in their favour, but by the end of the Republic the elite completely controlled the state, siphoning off power, riches and influence for their own benefit. They often were screwing over the same men who fought in the legions, or who were voting in the Popular Assemblies. They did not anticipate that demagogues like Pompey and Caesar could weaponise the disenfranchised and the disaffected elements of society for their own benefit. Therefore, they found themselves often facing down new juggernauts whom they had little influence or control over, as they had not paid their dues to the establishment but bypassed them and went straight to the people.",
