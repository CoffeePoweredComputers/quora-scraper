            "answer_text": "Most likely yes. Brain size alone does not connote intelligence. A human brain is MUCH bigger than a crow, yet both are intelligent creatures. The real question is the brain-body ratio. Humans are similar in size to pigs and big cats, but our brains are MUCH larger than either of theirs. The larger dinosaurs had small brains relative to their bodies, especially for the sauropods. They really didn\u2019t need much brainpower. Therapods, on the other hand, had larger brains relative to their bodies, as they needed to be clever to catch fast or well-armed and/or armored prey. Imagine taking on a ankylosaurus, a walking tank, with your bare hands. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know the QI of a small modern bird but I don\u2019t see any reason for they being far more intelligent than eventually giant dinosaurs once that one should be reducing the intelligent capacity of a giant dinosaur and I don\u2019t believe also that how much big is a living being lesser is its intelligent capacity because there isn\u2019t direct reason for that, however I don\u2019t believe that was by giant dinosaurs be low on its intelligent capacity that they would go to the extinction once that isn\u2019t because that a specie is very intelligent that will live more on Earth because this shows it the species like an ant or any other insect on which one can\u2019t measure the QI of these small creatures and they live on Earth perhaps more time than the own Man that is the most intelligent of all the species.
