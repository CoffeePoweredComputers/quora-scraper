            "answer_text": "My frame of reference is Canadian and my hands on experience does not engage until mid 80\u2019s so the value of my answer is limited. The defence, defined in s. 16 of our criminal code, remains narrowly prescribed. It is not a specific plea, although often so misunderstood (even amongst my Canadian colleagues) , rather a defence negating mens rea. Changes have been largely cosmetic: the language changed from \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity\u201d (NGRI) to \u201cnot criminally responsible\u201d (NCR). Thanks for the ask. Sandberg ",
