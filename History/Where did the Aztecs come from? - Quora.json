            "answer_text": "All indigenous people in Mexico originated from a migration from further north. Aztec tradition included a memory of migration no doubt more recent than the original one thousands of years earlier but again was from the northwest. \u201cAmong the results was the discovery of three distinct genetic clusters in different areas of Mexico, as well as clear remnants of ancient empires that cross seemingly remote geographical zones. In particular, the Seri people along the northern mainland coast of the Gulf of California and a Mayan people known as the Lacandon, near the Guatemalan border, are as genetically different from one another as Europeans are from Chinese. \u201c Mexican Genetics Study Reveals Huge Variation in Ancestry But I\u2019m not aware of any DNA test from northwest Mexico showing affinity to the Aztecs. There have been tests showing Aztec movement influencing other areas. I think conclusions about their origin are based on language rather than DNA: their language is related to the Utes\u2019 language. ",

            "answer_text": "The Aztecs, or as they called themselves, the Mexica, were part of a large migration of peoples (the Nahuatlaca) coming from somewhere to the north and west, probably in what is today the lower Colorado basin. During their migration, they stopped in a place they called Aztl\u00e1n: the location is unknown, but the currently most accepted proposal is that the place was located near the mouth of the San Pedro river, in Mexcaltitl\u00e1n, in the Mexican state of Nayarit. From there, they started a religiously inspired (or so they claimed) migration to central Mexico. ",

Not surprisingly there was a dominant culture already there when the Aztecs came down into the Central Valley to settle, and as part of establishing diplomatic relations with their new neighbors, the Aztecs invited the king\u2019s daughter to be a high priestess and live among them. Sometime later an emissary from this neighboring people came to visit, and found an Aztec High Priest wearing her skin. From what else I\u2019ve read of Aztec religion, this is entirely plausible to me. ",
