            "answer_text": "I believe it is possible that Germany could have won world war II, but Germany made at least three pivotal errors, and weather also played it\u2019s hand. One of the pivotal errors was that Germany allowed the BEF to escape Dunkirk. It\u2019s still unclear why they did that exactly (I\u2019ve heard three different theories to explain that error) but that error kept Great Britain in the war. The second pivotal error was declaring war on the US after Pearl Harbor. The US always recognized Germany as the greater threat, but apparently Roosevelt labored over how to deal with Germany after Pearl Harbor, knowing it would be a hard sell to convince the American public to fight a war against both Japan and Germany, especially since Germany hadn\u2019t attacked the US (Basically what George Bush did by starting a war against Iraq after 9/11, but I digress\u2026). Germany solved that problem by declaring war against the US. Hitler apparently boasted that the Wermacht need only kick the door open against the Soviet Union and the whole rotting structure would cave in. To a large extent that was actually true. The military leadership of the Soviet Union had been decimated by the communist purges and they basically offered no defense against the Wermacht at the beginning of the war. However, the third mistake made by Germany is that they made no effort to win over the Soviet people in the conquered lands, and that led to both guerrilla uprisings, and patriotic opposition to the invasion. The Germans very nearly captured Moscow before Winter set in. Unfortunately for the Germans, they did not launch their invasion until June 22nd. An earlier invasion date might well have spelled the fall of Moscow. Although the Germans have been criticized for the late invasion date, Spring apparently came late that year, and the roads in the Soviet Union were largely impassable before June 22nd, so starting the invasion earlier wasn\u2019t really an option. The late Spring may have saved the Soviets. There are many other strategic matters one could point to and argue that a change here or there might have made a difference in the outcome. For example, the Germans split their armies into three groups during the invasion of the Soviet Union. Some have argued that Moscow should have been the primary objective of the war. Also, Germany very nearly ousted the Allies from Africa, and they probably would have done so after taking Tobruk if they had greater air support (they would have decimated the retreating British forces). If they had done that, Rommel could have linked up with the German forces fighting the Soviets, and there might have been a different outcome there. However, these arguments are less persuasive in my mind. It\u2019s really hard to know how these strategic changes would have changed the outcome. One thing seems pretty certain to me. The Germans took an enormous risk when they invaded the Soviet Union. They could not afford any strategic errors if they had any chance of winning. For that reason alone, they probably had essentially no chance of winning right from the outset, so my answer to this question needs to be framed in that light. ",

            "answer_text": "I can see two ways in which Germany could plausibly have won World War II. 1. If Germany had developed nuclear weapons first, this would have turned the tide of the war. Of course, this could only have happened if Germany was not governed by the Nazis and did not systematically murder Jews or consider modern theoretical physics of the sort advanced by Einstein to be \u201cJewish physics.\u201d 2. If Germany had coordinated with Japan to invade the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa could have gone differently. \u201cCould\u201d is the operative word here; the Soviets may still have emerged victorious eventually, but it is conceivable that the USSR would have fallen in the face of a joint German-Japanese onslaught. As it happened, the Imperial Japanese Army (or, for that matter, the Japanese navy or air force) did virtually nothing to assist the Wehrmacht against the Soviets. This is despite the fact that the largest and most prestigious army group of the IJA, the Kwantung Army, was garrisoned in Manchukuo, the puppet state in northeastern China that directly bordered the USSR. In a one-on-one fight, the Soviets would have handily beaten the Japanese, but it is not clear that they could have handled the two Axis powers simultaneously. Aside from having to hold off another million soldiers, the Soviets would have had to fight a two-front war, with one front being the resource-rich and sparsely populated Siberia. The German experience as a central power shows that having to fight on two fronts is a deadly strategic liability. It could have been even worse for the Soviets. Its large expanse of territory was both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, the USSR had what military strategists call strategic depth - it could afford to lose land and maintain its core industrial areas and population centers. On the other, the size of the country meant that logistics and troop mobility would have been hellishly bad. Such a play by the Axis would have had its challenges. Japan had its own motivations for not involving itself in Barbarossa, not least because it did not want to endure the certain deaths of hundreds of thousands of its servicemen in a showdown with the Red Army. It also placed more importance on realizing territorial ambitions in Asia in order to expand the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japan was already mired down in China and, of course, also had to face the United States by 1942. Japan\u2019s generals knew that in ambushing Pearl Harbor, their country was entering into a conflict that it had no hope of winning. Part of Tokyo\u2019s strategy was to temporarily incapacitate America\u2019s Pacific expeditionary capabilities, delay the American response, and enlarge the Japanese sphere of control in the meanwhile before ultimately suing for peace from a position of relative strength. This strategy would not have been helped by participating in Barbarossa. But if Japan had shifted its strategy and managed to help Germany successfully bring down the USSR, then World War II would have been lost for the Allies. France was already defeated. Britain had a fearsome navy but limited ground forces. The US had to project power from an ocean away, and would not have been able to stop the Germans from taking over Europe. ",
