            "answer_text": " This carton is a symbolize of ways the rich act. America, and most of the western world live in a materialistic world. Although, doing better in terms of wealth than ever in history of mankind the average American person is in debt and has not money saved in 401Ks or pension plans. This is seen not only to the average income $40,000\u2013$50,000 dollars, but surprisingly those at an average age of 40\u201345 (20 years worth over saving) with an annual income of $150,000 only represented 5% of millionaires. Even, more shocking, is that the most in debt profession is Physician. Okay doctors have a lot of medical bills to pay, but these if saved probably on the average salary of $175,000 would be paid in 5 years. They have often come bottom on financial literacy tests. So why are these people that earn a substantial amount of money still in debt. People spend more than they earn They have high debt levels Don\u2019t budget Have to many credit cards They live a high lifestyle for their needs (join country clubs, nice gyms) They don\u2019t save So what can you do to change this  First change your mind set in regards to spending How is this done? Personally think Rich Dad Poor Dad explains this well (his other books try and capitalist on this success). Define what is an assets and what is a liability. Assets is something that gains in value Liability this is something that devalue in worth for example cars. You need to keep you liabilities less than your assets. Here are the six lessons to become financial Independent  1) Combat your spending- Don\u2019t spend more than 80% of your salary and save the other 20%. Researching in the U.S found that wealthiest people saved 20%. But less than 5% actually do this. If you want to be wealthy be in the 5% saving. 2) Start budgeting- the average I met client X he was worth $1 million, yet his salary never topped $75,000 he was retired at the age of 50. When I met client X he should me a spread sheet of his spending, this was done to the day how much he could spend for the next 30 years and what it could be spent on. Client X, lived in Thailand, had enough money to live comfortable for the rest of his life. I have met numerous Clients (I would say in their 100s) that earn more than double what client X has but live in the earn hard spend hard. When they have seen me at 55 have less than $30,000 to their name. If you want to be wealthy be like clients X budget your needs. 3) Live below your means- The average millionaire has a salary of just $60,000 a year. Why they live below their means. They don\u2019t buy expensive watches live in modest house and save towards their 401k. This is the richest man alive wearing a watch that cost $55. So if you want to become financially independent live below your means.  4) Become financially literate- The richest people spend more time looking at investment options than shopping online. The most successfully people, spend the most time picking their advisor. The people, that I know have done the best have spent their time to pick a good financial advisor. The most financial independent people I know spent months studding if I was suitable to look after their life savings. And look at the options. This is said for a study of average millionaires. Spend 20 hours a week reading and learning about investments. If you want to become wealthy, spend more time learning how to become wealthy 5) Lower your tax- The average millionaire only pays 3% tax. How is this, most in fairness do have their own business. But even if you don\u2019t and have a set income make use of tax efficient saving pension scheme, lower tax region, reduce your Inheritance tax. Lower you tax legally though saving and pension plans. 6) Invest for the long term and don\u2019t try and time the market- Note that 70% of personal fail when investing. 80% of fund mangers, don\u2019t beat the S and P 500. So what are you options, use compound interest and dollar cost averaging these are the two magic rules of investing that nearly no one uses. The S and P has an average growth of 8% a year over the last 20 years  It also out performs most hedge funds  THE YOUNGER YOU START THE EASIER IT BECOMES. The table below shows if you start at 20 you will need to save $61 a month while if you start at 55 you will need to save $4,749.   Use the 80/20 rule If you are safer investor (3%) go in to bonds 80% and 20% equities low cost index funds work best. If you are going for a higher level go 80% in equities global large cap and 20% bonds and fixed interest. For really high risk 10%+ , go 80% in the index and 20% in some sexier.

            "answer_text": " This may amaze you, but believe it or not, they are both connected. A lot of people think `risk` and `return` are inversely correlated, but that often isn\u2019t the case. The best way is to: Get a middle-income job - your spending habits matter more than your spending, but if you don't have a job or are on minimum wage, things will be tougher to create a surplus.Have good spending habits - they are one of the keys to wealth, and few know that.Read the evidence on finance - you need to go into battle with the right `tools` as most people base their decisions on emotions in financeInvest your surplus in sensible portfolio 1\u20132 = you now have a surplus. Now, invest into a sensible, low-cost portfolio. Buy, hold and rebalanceOutsource (if needed) - Most people don't have the temperament to be a DIY investor. Getting the knowledge is the easy part, provided you are patient with reading even the boring evidence. Implementing it no matter what is difficult, as human nature get\u2019s in the way.Whatever you do, don\u2019t believe a lot of the media hype about\u201d: The spending habits of the richThe fact it is a conspiracy and the game is rigged in favor of the richRemember 98% of people who `get rich quick` in speculating don't beat the markets over a 40\u201350 year career. Over-performance doesn\u2019t last.I would add one thing: real estate. It isn\u2019t the `safest` route to wealth. In fact, unlike what most people think, real estate underperforms markets long-term. According to the Land Registry in the UK (http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/) the average property was 55,000 Sterling in 1995, and is now at 225,000 Sterling in 2018, representing a 309% increase. Even if we don\u2019t factor in the costs of up-keeping the house, which can be huge, the returns are poor compared to markets. In early 1995, the Dow Jones was sitting at $3,900, and was sitting at $26,616 in 2018, representing a rise of more than 6.5X. Once you factor in the lower costs of a stock portfolio and the costs of up keeping a house, which can be substantial if it is a new kitchen or something else which is a big cost, the difference in returns are even bigger. It isn\u2019t just US markets either. The German Dax was 2,100 in 1995, and almost hit 13,000 in 2018. The UK FTSE 100 hasn\u2019t performed as well as US or German markets or the FTSE250. It was sitting at 2,900 in 1995, and was at 7,800 in 2018. Even the super hot markets like London have underperformed. In 1995 a London House cost 107,000 pounds and cost 739,000 in 2018, which is a +587% sterling gain. The Dow Jones enjoyed a +582% USD Profit and a over 600% Sterling profit in the same period. However, if you are looking to move up the risk ladder a bit (but not as much as investing in individual stocks or bitcoin), property can work due to leverage. The man below is a former cleaner. Sean Conlon, an immigrant from Ireland.He started as an assistant janitor and became a millionaire - How these 3 janitors went on to become self-made millionaires  Here are some strategies in the real estate market: Example 1 - Asking Price \u00a380,000 In the UK and elsewhere, cheaper houses in run down areas often have better yields, Let\u2019s say you need to put down a deposit of \u00a320,000 pounds. In addition to the \u00a320,000, you may need to pay fees to lawyers and for surveys, which will probably cost about \u00a31,400-\u00a31,600. Stamp Duty would cost around \u00a32,400. It is 0% for first time buyers on cheap property, but 3% on buy to lets which cost \u00a30 - \u00a3125,000. Houses costing \u00a3125,001 - \u00a3250,000 is charged at 5%, and the rate goes up to a maximum of 13%. The UK system is similar to many other countries which have sales taxes on buying property. Finally in terms of costs, lets say there are some basic refurbishments that cost \u00a3900-\u00a31,100. The total cost including deposit is \u00a325,000. In the UK, in an inner city area such as Manchester or Stoke on Trend, such a property may rent for \u00a3575 per month based on houses in a similar area/price range. Getting \u00a3600 is possible, and if you target students which is risky as it is a smaller population who don\u2019t always look after housing, you can get even more if it works out. But let\u2019s use the \u00a3575 to be safe. From that we need a mortgage for \u00a360,000 at 5% interest, which will cost \u00a3250 a month. Management fees and insurance should come to \u00a3135, as an allowance for repairs at 10% of rent is fairly safe. Now let\u2019s imagine that the property is vacant for 2 weeks a year. 1 month every 2 years or 2 month every 4 years. With all these rental figures and costs, we end up with a yearly profit of about \u00a32,200, which is a return on investment of 8.8% per annum. Longer-term if you get capital gains, the returns may be higher. If you keep buying a new property like this every 18 months, and you do it for 15 years, you will have a yearly rental income of \u00a322,000 after 15 years. By year 6-7, it may even be possible to buy 2 properties a year rather than every 18 months, given the accumulative process of building up capital. This example shows how leverage can work in property. If somebody buys 10 properties with this method, they would have spent \u00a3250,000, delivering an income of \u00a322,000. If cash would have been used instead, it would have only be possible to buy 2 properties, which would produce a yearly income of \u00a310,200. There are other strategies when it comes to real estate investing, including buying a cheap run down property and spending a lot making it over. This strategy though, is most effective for people who can do the work themselves, and therefore save on some of the fittings costs. Example 2: Middle-class commuter towns Another strategy is to rent out a property to multiple tenants, especially in professional areas such as Milton Keynes or other commuter towns. Let\u2019s say you buy the property for \u00a3190,000. You would need to spend \u00a37,000 on stamp duty, \u00a310,000 on start up costs, \u00a3220 on repairs (10% again) and \u00a3593 on a mortgage if you get \u00a3142,500 borrowed on 5%. Now let\u2019s say you have 6 tenants paying \u00a3370 each, so total monthly income of \u00a32,200. This gives a return on investment of close to 17%, adjusted to costs. The point is, that is hard work. Finding a property where you can fit 6-7 people in and getting 6-7 trustworthy people who don\u2019t leave quickly, isn\u2019t easy. Buying an S&P Index Fund takes less than 10 seconds. These property strategies can be time consuming and full of risk. You can beat the long-term average of 10% per annum stock market returns, but it will take a lot of work and tolerance for higher risk too. That is not to mention that many people can\u2019t get mortgages at decent rates. For people with well-paying secure jobs, for example public sector workers such as doctors, the above strategy is less risky. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t low risk, as without income protection insurance, the doctor may still lose their job, or public sector jobs may become more insecure. For anybody who may lose their income, the above strategy can lead to ruin if something unexpected happens. This is especially the case during a real estate downturn that regularly happens. This is because leveraged gains through mortgages also applies the only way around - leveraged losses. So for me, I just have a low-cost (non leveraged) portfolio. Buy and hold and rebalance. Takes a few seconds online and is not risky long-term unless there is a nuclear war! 6 Steps to Financial Freedom ",
