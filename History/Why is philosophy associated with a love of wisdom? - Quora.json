            "answer_text": "Because it\u2019s a traditional habit to call that subject in that name. We use it as a noun, as a verb, as an adjective and as an adverb. This word was used for so long to describe this field, we currently have no other suggestion to call it otherwise than \u201cphilosophy\u201d, AKA, as the love of wisdom (philo - love, sophia - wisdom). But the thing is, the name itself, \u201cphilosophy\u201d, is fallacious by itself, ironic as it may sound. Philosophy is about contemplation, analysis and introspection, in an attempt to reach possible truths. You can do any of these intellectual actions without feeling a specific emotion, hence why you don\u2019t necessarily need to feel love, either, in order to philosophize. Those who claim that feeling love is crucial in order to philosophize, should remember the end-goal of Wittgenstein, an early 20th century philosopher - to annihilate philosophy altogether. Those who want to destroy certain things, are very likely to not like these things, let alone, love them. Therefore Wittgenstein is considered a philosopher even though he desired to destroy philosophy. He didn\u2019t need to love philosophy in order to philosophize, making the emotion of love unnecessary for this cognitive craft. We could, however, remove the word \u201cphilo\u201d and just call it \u201csophy\u201d or \u201csophia\u201d, but any of these suggestions have a negative association - at the time of Socrates there were \u201cSophists\u201d, people that offered words of wisdom in exchange for money. Socrates claimed that the \u201cSophists\u201d are nothing more than fakers and manipulators, and indeed this perception has gone through history and is still present today when we are to think about the \u201cSophists\u201d. I am unsure whether Socrates was right, however, but I have no evidence to support my criticism as of now. The term \u201cphilosophy\u201d is therefore a product of a habit that has been lasting for thousands of years, even though the term is not correct, as no emotion is necessary in order to philosophize. I would even go further and claim that too much emotion while philosophizing, even if that emotion is love, can hinder the quest of philosophy, by making the philosopher more biased in accordance to their current mood, and that emotional bias can hinder one from making logically-correct arguments and logically-possible discoveries.

            "answer_text": "If you ask for a common definition, the person will provide it within a context of ordinary usage and talking to people in public. It will suggest common activities, how people normally speak, and discussions about materials not entirely philosophical but practical and everyday life. If you ask for an academic definition, the faculty member will get into the properties and offerings the discipline confers to you during a degree, and afterwards into test scores, honors, or job outcomes. The basic morphemes in the word philosophy are phil and soph, combined to name an academic discipline. They mean love and wisdom respectively, where they are probably derived from Greek roots. That makes the most sense, rather than Latin roots, because the Greek philosophers and Hellenistic tradition have a major influence on Western philosophy. They have transferred many concepts, political theories, ideas, and studies in their language, to the ones farther west on the European continent. And only the Catholic church and theologians have had the same influence on the whole, to Western philosophy. ",
