            "answer_text": "Here we have the famous magayr chronicler Simon de Keza (XIII\u2019th century) describing events from the 9th century+: After almost all of Attila's sons had perished, together with their schythian people, in the war of Crumbelt, Pannonia went on for ten years without a king, remaining only to the foreigners: slavs, greeks (most likely means eastern rite christians), teutons (germans), messians (jews) and vlachs (romanians), who, during the days of Attila were slaves. [\u2026] Of the huns, three thousand men were left, who survived by running from the Crimildin war and who, fearing the western peoples, remained in the Chigla plains, until the rise of Arpad. These didn\u2019t even call themselves huns, but Zaculi (Szekelys). For these Zaculi are the remains of the huns who, when they heard the hungarians were returning to Pannonia, stud in their path as they were returning, in Ruthenia and, after conquering Pannonia together, descendend in part, but not in the plains of Pannonia, but, neighbours with the vlachs (romanians) they had the same fate in the mountains (Transylvania).  So you had various slavic, latin, germanic, turkic and maybe even semitic langauges & dialects being spoken. Pretty mcuh the same as today. ",

            "answer_text": " Probably the same dialects. One conquering and exploiting army of men does not change the local old dialects. Unless they build schools to teach the kids, like China does now in South Mongolia. Invading and conquering armies of men were usualy as big as 2,5% to 5% of their own population. Unless they carry each a wife and 6 children (of whom 3 will statisticaly die before the age of 10) , they can not preserve their own culture and have to reproduce with local women, thus their kids losing or mixing strongly their Magyar heritage, being surrounded by 90% subjected locals. How the fino-ungric languages evolved is an undocumented mystery to me. For sure the explanations we believe today are wrong:-), as I prove by logic and common sense. ",
