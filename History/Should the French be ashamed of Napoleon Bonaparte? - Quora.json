            "answer_text": "For Anglophone people, history is history made by English propaganda . As the English power at the time created an image of a monster nowadays Americans, who mostly know history through Hollywood, itself based on English lies, ask this sort of questions . Napoleon was a conqueror, not a racist or an exterminator who systematically slaughtered conquered people as the Brits did towards Native Americans . If Napo was a monster, why not Julius Caesar or Alexander the Great ? Beside his wars he established all sorts of laws or institutions still existing now, and which have been willingly copied in several countries . From his expedition in Egypt where he brought many scientists with him, we are able to understand the hieroglyphs and the Cairo Museum started its role for knowledge .Another thing systematically hidden by the English, as I can see from US childish comments here and there, is the fact the French did not start European wars at this time . Before Napo, all kingdoms of Europe, financed by England, had declared war to the new French republic, and the revolutionary wars were France against everybody around, all European monarchs trying to get rid of the revolution plague before it spread into their own despotic countries . The French in this occasion, invented the national conscription, calling all citizens to defend the young republic from the \"Tyrants \". And they succeeded, without Napoleon who was not the big boss until 1799 . By this time, England also supported several counter-revolution civil wars, as Vend\u00e9e, and the main reason of the Terror, never said either in Anglo historical farce, is the mutiplicity of these internal and external threats . The paranoia about treason triggered a paroxysmal madness .Napoleonian wars were the continuation of this initial revolutionary resistance . But, what I don't forgive him is he was an instrument for the French bourgeoisie to stop the revolution before it became a real revolution for the poor . After the beginning his wars were no more revolutionary wars but just the dirty ordinary wars, wars of conquests for power and money . When I read \"he reintroduced slavery\", making a monster of him as if slavery wasn't the norm everywhere by then, as if the USA didn't keep slavery at home  until the 1860s, I recognize the English way of lying : never saying a pure lie, but cleverly obliterating everything else, therefore screwing the real understanding of a situation .

            "answer_text": "Good history should not be about feeling proud or ashamed. At the same time, popular history is often taught to create the myths on which nations are built.  Napoleon has long been a mythical pillar for French institutions as well as a romantic hero. Today, the French know all its neighbours considered him mostly as a tyrant. They were recently remembered he was also the man who reintroduced slavery. At last, his wars essentially weakened France.  More ideologically, Napoleon was credited with spreading the spirit of the French revolution but today the French revolution itself is reassessed and considered as the bedrock of totalitarianism and genocide (in Vend\u00e9e). France is currently reassessing the Napoleonic period and moving towards a more balanced \"objective\" approach. Napoleon has lost his position as an icon of French \"grandeur\" and is mostly saluted as an organizer though the numerous insititutions he created which still exist. In 2002, it was decided NOT to celebrate Austerlitz bicentennial in 2005.  In 2015, France officials kept a very low profile for Waterloo bicentennial but medias extensively covered the event (edit) In 2015, \"Imagerie d'Epinal\" which was a major propaganda tool for Napoleon changed owners to enter the apparel industry.
