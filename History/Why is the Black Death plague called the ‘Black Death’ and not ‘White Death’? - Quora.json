            "answer_text": "Because \u201cthe Black Death\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to the racial character of the people who were dying. It refers to the pustules or \u201cbuboes\u201d that formed on their bodies, that were often the most evident outward sign of infection. (This is also where we get another of this plague\u2019s names, the Bubonic Plague.) These buboles - which were swollen lymph nodes - could erupt in red or black pus in the later stages. Black patches also could appear on the skin due to subcutaneous bleeding. People who were infected also frequently developed gangrene in the hands and feet - also turning the skin there black. In the Middle Ages, though, this disease was most often called \u201cThe Great Pestilence\u201d, \u201cthe pestilence\u201d, \u201cthe Great Mortality\u201d, or even \u201cthe blue sickness\u201d. (This one is actually the least clear to me; maybe it referred to people who developed the most serious version, pneumonic plague, being essentially unable to breathe in the final stages?) The epithet \u201cBlack Plague\u201d is a more recent label; however, I haven\u2019t been able to find anything that directly attributes it to a source. Regardless of the source of the \u201cBlack Death\u201d or \u201cBlack Plague\u201d label, though, there would be absolutely no reason to call it the \u201cWhite Death\u201d. Bubonic plague killed (and kills) across all racial, social, and economic classes - outbreaks hit China, Mongolia, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as all across Europe. ",

            "answer_text": "It wasn't called the Black Death by its contemporaries. It was generally some form of \u201cthe great pestilence\u201d. Calling the 1300s plague the \u201cBlack Death\u201d is a fairly modern conceit, but no-one actually knows how it came about. The gangrene, the colour of the buboes, anything about the blackness of despair \u2014 that's all basically the historical equivalent of a backronym. We know it's called the Black Death, and now we're trying to work out why. From Philip Ziegler's The Black Death, 1969: One of the minor mysteries which does still persist over the Black Death is the genesis of its name. The traditional belief is that it was so called because the putrefying flesh of the victims blackened in the final hours before death supervened. The trouble about this otherwise plausible theory is that no such phenomenon occurred. It is true that, in cases of septicaemic plague, small black or purple blotches formed on the bodies of the sick and this symptom must have made a vivid impression on beholders. But if the name of the epidemic had been derived primarily from the appearance of its victims, one would have expected it to have been used at the time. Of this there is no evidence. Indeed, it seems that such a title was not generally heard until the eighteenth century, though similar expressions had often been applied to other epidemics in the past. The first recorded use of the term for the epidemic of 1348 is in a reference to the swarta d\u00f6den in Sweden in 1555. About fifty years later it emerged in Denmark as the sorted\u00f8d. Cardinal Gasquet believed that, in England at least, the name began to be used some time after 1665 to distinguish the fourteenth-century epidemic from the \u2018Great Plague\u2019 which ravaged Carolean London. The fact that the title \u2018Black Death\u2019 was not used by contemporaries similarly makes it hard to credit those other explanations which attributed the name to a black comet seen before the arrival of the epidemic, to the number of people who were thrown into mourning as a result of the high mortality or to the popular images of the plague as a man on a black horse or as a black giant striding across the countryside. The most likely explanation seems to be that it originally stemmed from an over-literal translation into the Scandinavian or the English of the Latin pestis atra or atra mors. Even in the fourteenth century the word \u2018atra\u2019 could connote \u2018dreadful\u2019 or \u2018terrible\u2019 as well as \u2018black\u2019. But once the mistranslation had been established then all the other reasons for associating \u2018Black\u2019 with \u2018Death\u2019 must have contributed to give it general currency. In France it was once called the morte bleue. The superior dreadfulness of the accepted phrase is obvious and today no other style would be acceptable. ",
