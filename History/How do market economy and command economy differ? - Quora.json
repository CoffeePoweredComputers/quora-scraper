            "answer_text": "Hello A \u201ccommand economy\u201d is a \u201cplanned economy\u201d - one where the Government picks and chooses who wins and who loses.On the surface, a \u201ccommand economy\u201d appears to be \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201cpopulist\u201d but in reality, it enriches a very few at the expense of the many. It's also economies, that the central authority determines production and distribution. In the old Soviet Union, the decisions were made by state bureaucracies. While market economy,is a system where exchange governs production and distribution, either through barter or money. I plow your field and you grind my grain (barter) or I plow your field for $10.Market The benefit of a market economy is that it does a good job meeting the needs of the buyers and sellers, and without the overhead of a command economy. It tend to be effective and efficient. About which countries have market economies, all modern advanced economies are mixed, that is, countries like the US have mostly market economies, with some part of the economy under the control of the government, or command sector. To use round numbers, think of the US as 80/20 market/command. ",

            "answer_text": "In a command economy, the state owns all the factors of production (land, labor, and capital). Resources are allocated based on need instead of efficiency. In a market economy, there is no government intervention, and it operates on the assumption that efficiency will be achieved through rational self-interest. Command economies and market economies are the same in that both fail in the real world. Command economies fail because of massive inefficiencies, which arise because of a lack of incentive to be productive. Market economies fail because of market failure, when the free market fails to allocate resources efficiently due to externalities. ",

            "answer_text": "Market economies use the laws of Supply and Demand to function. There is no gov\u2019t control over the economy. Ever. The problem with no gov\u2019t involvement is the emergence of monopolies. Pure Capitalism. Command economies are heavily controlled by the gov\u2019t. The gov\u2019t determines quantity of a good to eliminate surplus and prevent scarcity. Countries like the former USSR and North Korea are examples of this. ",
