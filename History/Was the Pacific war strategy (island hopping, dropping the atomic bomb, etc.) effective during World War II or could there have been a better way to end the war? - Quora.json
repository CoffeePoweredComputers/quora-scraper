            "answer_text": "There is a lot of criticism of the fact that the President Roosevelt allowed a two pronged attack in the Pacific. In the South Pacific it was under Army General MacArthur while the Central Pacific Campaign was led by Naval Admiral Nimitz. Neither MacArthur nor Nimitz thought that the two pronged attack was necessary and they are probably correct.  It did have the advantage of making it very difficult for the Japanese to know where the allies would strike next. The disadvantage of the two pronged assault is a whole lot of islands were invaded that could have been bypassed completely had the attack been more focused. In short, Roosevelt failed to choose between the two and the result almost certainly was higher allies casualties and possibly a longer war. The same argument can be made of the Itialian campaign. Yes, it knocked Italy out of the war, however, I can see little benefit to the allies continuing the advance up Italy once the allies had landed in Normandy. The continuation of that campaign gets even murkier after the landings in Southern France. That said, these \"what ifs\" are always a matter of conjecture. What the allies did ultimately worked. ",

            "answer_text": "So many of these answers assume there was something wrong with the island hopping strategy and they completely ignore what was right with it. Lets start with a geography lesson: The Pacific Ocean is a Big Freaking Place! The two prongs, south from Australia (Army) and west from Hawaii (Navy), had two huge benefits. The first was very practical, the Department of the Navy and the Department of the War really did not speak or coordinate in very many ways. This was one of the reasons the Department of Defense was created in the wake of WWII. It was incredibly hard to coordinate the two disperate services, and when they tried, people died. In droves. Better to keep the two semi-separate and let them work effectively in different directions, there was no time to develop new doctrines. The second was a strategic win! Again, the Pacific Ocean is a BIG FREAKING PLACE. By putting multiple prongs and uncertainty from two very different approaches, you forced the Japanese to cover everything. Guess what? They couldn\u2019t cover everything. They were half as effective in the south and half as effective in the west. This is a total military win. Make your enemy split his forces trying to cover everything, as a result, he covers nothing. Make his logistical tail 14,000 miles instead of 7,000 miles and watch him squirm!!!! Island hopping minimized the US disadvantage off poor coordination between the navy and the army, and it maximized the advantage against the enemy. It was a good approach. ",
