            "answer_text": "This is not an easy question to give a precise answer to. The bomb was tested in the day time, which limits the possibility of extreme long distance detection since the flash has to be bright enough to be visible against the daytime background illumination. For comparison, the end of \u201castronomical twilight\u201d, when the last sunlight disappears from the sky, occurs when the sun is below the horizon 18 degrees and sunset (where the sun disappears below the horizon) is 1200 miles (2000 km) away. This is only true because the sunlight being scattered by the upper atmosphere is being viewed against the black night sky, and is reduced considerably if a bright moon is up. To see the test it would suffice for the top of the still glowing fireball to rise above the horizon. At a guesstimate of a maximum altitude of 50,000 feet, and you were standing at an altitude of 5000 feet, then the distance would be 360 miles (600 km). Now the flash might be visible farther if it reflected off high altitude clouds, but then we would be talking about the fireball when it is extremely bright, and thus at a lower altitude. The horizon distance from a 20,000 foot fireball top is 173 miles, if it then illuminates clouds at 30,000 feet that adds 212 miles, plus another 212 miles to your (sea-level) horizon, plus 87 miles if you are at an altitude of 5000 feet, all totaling 684 miles (1100 km). Now there is the effect of atmospheric refraction that actually extends how far you can see over the geometrical curvature of the Earth by about 0.5 degrees (30 miles), but then there is atmospheric extinction that absorbs light and may prevent the light from being visible even if there are no clouds in the way (a questionable assumption) along the very long sight path , especially since we are grazing the horizon (which blocks everything) and seeing through a very thick layer of air, twice. All told, viewing the flash at 1000 km from the ground seems unlikely, but just possible (if my assumed fireball values are correct) if everything breaks in your favor and you are at a good elevation. 2000 km seems right out, 2000 miles (3200 km) is ridiculous. The best chance at viewing from a long distance is if you were in an airplane at high altitude. Today airliners can break 40,000 feet, but back in 1962, an altitude of 25,000 feet would be more typical, though a military aircraft might be as high as 40,000 feet. A direct view of the fireball top of 50,000 feet from an altitude of 40,000 feet is 517 miles (830 km) and would work reliably if there no clouds on the horizon. Now the mushroom cloud would be visible from a high altitude aircraft from farther, since it rose to 210,000 feet, giving a horizon distance of 563 miles, and a total sight path of 800 miles (1280 km) for an airplane at 40,000 feet.
