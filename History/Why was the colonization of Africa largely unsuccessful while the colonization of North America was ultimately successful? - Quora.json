            "answer_text": "Well the long and the short of it is.... different immune systems in the native populations.  In the America's the filthy Europeans carried all kinds of diseases that annihilated the native American population by up to 98%.  ( I say filthy... because most Europeans at this time... just did not bathe.)  NA immune systems were geared towed parasite prevention due to their life styles and isolation  Africans on the other hand had a completely different immune system. While they might not of had immunites  to some of the diseases they were never really wiped out. Plus malaria is a tough disease for euro's... So basically it was a very effective deterrent.  So africa was still densely populated even after the Europeans introduced their funk. They never got the upper hand population wise like they did in the Americas. ",

            "answer_text": "The main reason is geography. North America is pretty analogous with Europe from a climate/geography/wildlife point of view. European settlers had a pretty easy time simply transplanting European farming techniques and living styles to North America. This was  less easy to do in Africa (until you get all the way down to the far south of the continent). Jared Diamond's excellent Guns, Germs, and Steel goes into detail on this if you want to learn more. ",
