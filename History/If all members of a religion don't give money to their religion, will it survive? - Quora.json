            "answer_text": "I suppose that would depend on the religion, and what it needs to survive. \u201cReligion\u201d refers more directly to a set of ideals or beliefs, of course, and beliefs do not have bank accounts. They simply need minds to hold and share them. So there\u2019s really no reason any religion would be killed directly nobody is giving money (to\u2026 whatever they would give money towards). I assume, therefore, that the question is referring more to establishments of religion, like churches, missionaries, leaders, etc. But again, that would depend on the structure. If a church group meets in the park every Sunday and nobody pays or is paid to be there, then there\u2019s no flow of money that could be choked off, and the question is again moot. But when most people think of organized religion, they think of buildings. Buildings require resources to construct, which in our day is usually money. If there is no money, most buildings would not be built or maintained. That would certainly hinder that religion\u2019s ability to sustain and progress itself, but again it would not necessarily lead to its extinction. Members of the congregation could adapt by meeting in the park instead, and the religion would continue existing, even if smaller and weaker than before. If the leader of the congregation relies on member donations to support himself, he would have to find another source of income. Whether that means he can only preach religion in his spare time or he stops preaching altogether would depend on him and his situation. Larger organizations may have enough money already in their coffers that they could continue mostly-normal operations for quite some time, especially if they are earning interest on investments. But they too would obviously have to make some adjustments, and would likely stop expanding structurally. In summary: At the risk of stating the obvious, the answer to this question could only be \u201cyes\u201d if the religion in question required donations from members to stay afloat. While some of the more immediate effects of cutting of this income would be easy to predict, the long-term reality is more difficult. Surely some religions would not survive without money, but just as surely many would adapt. My opinion would be that if a religion cannot survive in the human mind by virtue of its correctness alone (i.e. it does not require constant external \u201creminders\u201d to be retained) it might not be worth giving your money to in the first place. Food for thought. ",

            "answer_text": "A religion is a business and no business can survive without income. The contributions of members of the religion are the main income for most religions. Sure, some will also rent their churches or church halls for various functions\u2026I regularly go to concerts at a local church and I \u2019m sure the music group pays rent to the church to use it. So, no, if nobody goes to church and puts money in the collection plate, the religion will not survive ",
