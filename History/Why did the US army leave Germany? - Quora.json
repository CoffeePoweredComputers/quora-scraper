            "answer_text": "As others have pointed out, there is still a significant US military presence in Germany. But your question is correct in that we have pulled back our presence from it\u2019s height after WWII and during the Cold War. Strategically, once the Cold War ended there was simply less of a need to have such a large and expensive force stationed abroad. After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 there were several waves of troop drawdowns in Europe. I was a part of one of the more recent ones in the mid-2000s. For background, I was stationed in Germany from late 2002 \u2013 early 2007 (minus a year in 2003/2004 when I was in Iraq). My last two years I was one of two Port Operations officers for Northern Europe. Yes, the Army actually runs the ports, not the Navy! :-) We did a LOT of moving of equipment to/from Germany, almost all of it coming to/from Iraq, but not all. But there were certain units that we were packing up and sending back to the US permanently. Aside from the logical strategic reasons, I always wondered if it was at least in part tied to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld\u2019s pledge to punish Germany for not supporting the invasion of Iraq. In my opinion 1) he seemed like the kind of guy who would carry through on a threat like that and 2) he was in his position long enough to make it happen. Who knows? But it makes for some good conspiracy conversations! If you really want some good background, here\u2019s a really good article from Wikipedia that gives a much better overall picture than any of us could give you. ",

            "answer_text": "There are currently 6 Army posts/garrisons still active in Germany, so although we have a reduced presence in Germany (as well as in several other countries) we are still there. I speculate that as long as Putin keeps \u201cexercising\u201d his military we will probably be reactivating several of our old hauntings to keep him in check. I also believe they have revised the original precept for our billets there, was that the USSR (Russia) would exploit the Fulda Gap as their main attack scenario. Given that, you may see \u201cnew\u201d bases established in countries once considered \u201ceastern block\u201d to counter revised scenarios of Russian incursions. I do not ever see us \u201cLeaving\u201d any of our foreign posts entirely. We negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with each country that leases property to the US Military, part of those agreements include the economic impact of employing local nationals on those installations, as well as mutual defense. The infusion of US dollars into those economies is very important, although those countries leadership will not come right out and acknowledge that is one of the reasons they make those locations available. Whoever becomes our new Commander in Chief will have to make some very strategic decisions within the first 6 months of their term, and if Trump happens to be that person and stays true to form (going off half cocked when something doesn\u2019t suit him) then all bets are off.
