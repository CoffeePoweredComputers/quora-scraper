            "answer_text": "I will speak loosely. Scholasticism is the dominant philosophical school of thought in the Catholic universities from the time of St Thomas Aquinas through the height of the Enlightenment, and is known as the champion of Aristotle. The upside of scholasticism was that it was an attempt to bring all thought into one unified vision without leftover, so that you could use the same insights, facts, and assumptions to bear on all fields whatsoever. The downside is that it because boring as could be, insufferable to some minds. To answer the question, the first modern political thinkers to ignore Aristotle would be those who broke away from scholasticism. They would probably be those who wrote in the vernacular instead of Latin. Perhaps two important early political thinkers to ignore Aristotle would include Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan) and Machiavelli (The Prince). And of course there have been writers throughout history who have ignored their important predecessors. ",
