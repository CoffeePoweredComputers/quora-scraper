            "answer_text": "Orthodox Christians during and after the Protestant Reformation have always thought of it the same way, even as we may think of the Catholic Church. The movement itself, while initially intended pure in regards to issues they had with the Catholic Church, didn\u2019t handle it as it should have been handled. When a matter is plaguing the Church, the matter should be handled rather than schisming\u2014much like current issues in both the Orthodox and Catholic churches\u2014precisely because human beings are prone to error by the nature of being humans. If they could not err, there would be no point for ecumenical councils like that found in Acts 15. We handle the issue together after properly considering it and hearing all sides of the issue. The Catholic Church handled it likewise poorly when they attempted to excommunicate the Patriarch of Constantinople, which consequently resulted in the Catholic Church schisming in doing so due to papal supremacy. This is not the same thing as the Church itself, and I refer to the Orthodox Church when I say this, being invalid or untrue, especially due to human action. The roots of the Church extend to the apostles, evidential by the epistles of the direct disciples of the apostles themselves, and was defended and strengthened by subsequent Fathers. The Bible itself happened to be formed within the Tradition of the Church, and then had books torn from it due to the Protestant Reformation. So, the churches that formed from the Reformation are considered misguided and in spiritual danger. The Orthodox Church has always viewed Christians as those belonging to the Church; outside of it, they are heretics, and adherers to false doctrines, thus placing them in a spiritually devastating position.

            "answer_text": "Historically. From the start, the Apostles led the Church. They appointed bishops (such as Timothy, Titus, also Linus, Onesimus, &c.) to carry on their ministries. Each was subject to all the others, that there would be no divisions or heresies. As time passed, the bishops at Rome started taking themselves more and more seriously, until they started claiming that the whole Church owed them obedience. When all the Churches, outside of Rome and the \u201cHoly Roman Empire\u201d didn\u2019t think this change was a good idea, Rome declared them \u201coutside the Church.\u201d Essentially, as Queen Elizabeth I spoke of herself as being England, the \u201cPope\u201d claimed to be the Church. The other Churches were sorry he felt that way, but stayed with the original plan. The Popes, over time, got more presumptuous and abusive. The Reformers got fed up and pushed back. It turned into so many egos at odds with one another, leading to a war that killed more people than the Plague, re-drew the map of Europe according to sectarian lines, and redefined Christianity in the West as so many (thousands of) differing opinions, as if the Faith of Christ were something that could be derived simply by more study. The reigning motto of this movement has always been, \u201cSemper Reformanda,\u201d or, \u201cever reforming.\u201d Each previous generation is viewed with suspicion, and each new one feels obliged to work out its own point of view. This motto can also be interpreted as, \u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that,\u201d and each \u201cI,\u201d each ego, tends to take this as a divine directive. So, while the original Church followed (and follows) all the Apostles taught, Rome has kept most of it (with its own interpretations) and added a bit here and there, each Reforming tradition (yeah, they hate that word, no matter how the dictionary defines it) has kept less and added more, generation after generation. So, today, we see the process in sensation-chasing Pentecostals, staid Presbyterians, \u201copen-minded\u201d Methodists, and \u201cChristian Atheist\u201d Bible professors. Each one saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that.\u201d The Judge will come. ",
