            "answer_text": "Electricity wasn\u2019t invented. IT IS! Englishman William Whewell, a gifted wordsmith, coined the term \u201cscientist\u201d in 1833. Up until then gentlemen who dabbled in science thought of themselves as natural philosophers. Their objective was to explain or describe nature. In the early 19th century, the magic of science appeared to be a mystery that, with the right tools, might be exposed and controlled by humans. Both theoretical and practical sciences appeared to be moving at a \u201ccracking\u201d pace, and gentlemen who wanted to keep up had to work hard at it. Benjamin Franklin was one of these during the 18th century, and he is commonly identified as the first internationally well-known American scientist. He along with Volta, Ampere, Ohm, Henry, and Faraday formed a cadre of foundational \u201celectricians,\u201d but unlike them Franklin has no unit of electricity named in his memory. Although he got the mechanism wrong (electrons would not be discovered for 100 years), Franklin was the first to use + and \u2013 in terms of electrical polarity.[i] There was no well-established basis for connecting technology to science. The United States in this period, even more than in European countries, was a society steeped in a pronounced affection for the utilitarian. The United States was a nation of mechanics, not theorists. There was often a marked disconnect between theoretical concepts (generally left to Europeans) and the practical considerations faced by American inventors. During this period scientific engineering first emerged as a profession. The history of manufacturing engineering can be traced to factories in the mid 19th century US and late 18th century Britain. Electricity was not yet far enough developed to power industry, but its potential was making itself known well before the war. The English scientist Michael Faraday demonstrated the motor effect (the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical motion) in 1821, but his device was little more than a tabletop curiosity without torque or power. Not until the invention of the rechargeable lead-acid storage battery in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Plant\u00e9, did electricity become a feasible power source for small low voltage applications. Practical electric motors were not created from these engines, but rather from the development of power generators. The great advantage of electric motors was in their almost instantaneous development of maximum torque (tendency to rotate). This was especially advantageous for drills and rotary mills. AC motors would not become common for several more decades. The British scientist William Sturgeon invented the first commutator DC electric motor capable of turning machinery in 1832. The American inventor Thomas Davenport built a commutator-type DC electric motor made for commercial use. The motor, which he patented in 1837, ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press. The first modern DC dynamos fit for use in industrial applications were invented independently by Sir Charles Wheatstone, Werner Siemens, and Samuel Varley (circa 1866-1867). The years 1885 until 1889 saw the invention of the three-phase electric power system, which is the basis for modern electrical power transmission and advanced electric motors. A single inventor for the three-phase power system cannot be named, but certain names were deeply involved including Werner Siemens, William Ritchie, Hippolyte Pixii, and Nikola Tesla. Ultimately, the AC electric motor replaced the steam engine in driving machine tools, and did so largely by individual motors directly linked to each machine. Greater power could then be brought to each machine, particularly important for rapid, rough cuts using high-speed steel cutters. Moreover, machines were no longer tied to racks of shafts and belts on a milling floor. They could be placed anywhere that an electrical line was located. Power distribution in the plant was thereby simplified, and with use of voltage transformers after 1885, diversified. Nonetheless, in the absence of a widespread electrical power grid, electric power generators were themselves dependent on steam engines.[ii]  [i] Suzanne Burdon, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the Birth of Modern Science (2015).

            "answer_text": "Who invented electricity and when? Nobody - it\u2019s just a part of nature. Lightning, static electricity, and nerve impulses within your body are examples. Experiments were performed with electricity in these forms for centuries before the modern electrical age. This includes for example some notable experiments by Benjamin Franklin with his kites. Franklin was also responsible for denoting which type of charge was positive and which negative long before we knew about the particles that produced these charges. Instead what happened is that we learned to control electricity in the sense of being able to produce a steady supply, guide it along wires, and make it do useful work. But this was of course many separate inventions made by different people at different times. However as is often the case with history, one particular name springs to mind as a key enabler. This is the Italian scientist Alessandro Volta. Volta is remembered chiefly because of the Volt unit and the Voltaic battery to which his name was given in honour of his work. The battery in particular was key to enabling electricity to be produced reliably and continuously for experimentation. Volta publicised his invention of the battery in the year 1800. However Volta himself made it clear that even for the battery he was strongly influenced (ie: built heavily upon the work of) William Nicholson, Tiberius Cavallo, and Abraham Bennet, none of whom of course we recall with anything like the same familiarity. In fact the discovery that lead to the battery was made by another Italian Luigi Galvani ten years before. Purely by accident when experimenting with the effects of electricity on frogs muscles, Galvani found that using two connected metals had the same result without any apparent electrical supply. Indeed some people prefer the name Galvanic battery in recognition of this. Of course Galvani was experimenting with electricity and so he already had a supply. Before the battery this was typically in the form of an early capacitor called a Leyden Jar discovered in 1746, charged using static electricity generators which had evolved during the previous decades. This is the nature of science and discovery. It rarely happens that an individual makes a significant new discovery or invention completely out of the blue. Science instead progresses in fits and starts, through collaboration and knowledge sharing, fortune and dead-ends. Having something named after you may well give you fame and notoriety, but more often than not any of a number of others could justifiably have been given the honour. It\u2019s good to make an effort to find out the story rather than the soundbite. You\u2019ll often find that the detail is more interesting and revealing. ",

Its fun to play with laser on our cat, or drawing thing in neighbor wall. Then someone figure out a way to make it useful (reading CD-ROM or DVD, use it guide missile etc).  Electricity was first discovered as a static electricity, if you rub an amber or something shiny you can use it to attract things. Then someone figure out way to produce more of it and to store it in thing called Leiden Jar.  The first use of produced electricity was in show business. electricity can induce movement in dead frog leg. Some even use it on death human body which latter inspire the famous Doctor Frankenstein story.  People love this scientific magic show. To put it mildly they were electrified ! (yes, that was the original source of that word).   As people developed even stronger electricity battery, they produce even more electifying show. The battery were made from string of copper and zinc disc piled together (voltaic pile), or other combination of copper plate and zinc plate submerged on acid. We used to have those kind of battery in our car.    Unfortunately the general mass still don't get benefit from electricity. Electricity still being the domain of scientist.  Latter on scientist figure out how to make magnet from electricity, and they use it to separate good quality iron from bad quality iron. Then some thinkerer figure out a way to move iron bell from distance. So remote (non wireless) door bell were invented.  It was still way cheaper to just use rope tied to bell though than installing a electric bell.  Fast forwad to few invention latter.  The first most useful of electricity were on telegraph. That is the first time electricity use really changed the world. It was called a \"Victorian Internet\" because it really the first time the world really connected.  Further reading.

            "answer_text": "Electricity is a form of energy and it occurs in nature, so it was not \u201cinvented.\u201d As to who discovered it, many misconceptions abound. Some give credit to Benjamin Franklin for discovering electricity, but his experiments only helped establish the connection between lightning and electricity, nothing more. The truth about the discovery of electricity is a bit more complex than a man flying his kite. It actually goes back more than two thousand years. In about 600 BC, the Ancient Greeks discovered that rubbing fur on amber (fossilized tree resin) caused an attraction between the two \u2013 and so what the Greeks discovered was actually static electricity. Additionally, researchers and archeologists in the 1930\u2019s discovered pots with sheets of copper inside that they believe may have been ancient batteries meant to produce light at ancient Roman sites. Similar devices were found in archeological digs near Baghdad meaning ancient Persians may have also used an early form of batteries. But by the 17th century, many electricity-related discoveries had been made, such as the invention of an early electrostatic generator, the differentiation between positive and negative currents, and the classification of materials as conductors or insulators. In the year 1600, English physician William Gilbert used the Latin word \u201celectricus\u201d to describe the force that certain substances exert when rubbed against each other. A few years later another English scientist, Thomas Browne, wrote several books and he used the word \u201celectricity\u201d to describe his investigations based on Gilbert\u2019s work. 1752, Ben Franklin conducted his experiment with a kite, a key, and a storm. This simply proved that lightning and tiny electric sparks were the same thing. Italian physicist Alessandro Volta discovered that particular chemical reactions could produce electricity, and in 1800 he constructed the voltaic pile (an early electric battery) that produced a steady electric current, and so he was the first person to create a steady flow of electrical charge. Volta also created the first transmission of electricity by linking positively-charged and negatively-charged connectors and driving an electrical charge, or voltage, through them. In 1831 electricity became viable for use in technology when Michael Faraday created the electric dynamo (a crude power generator), which solved the problem of generating electric current in an ongoing and practical way. Faraday\u2019s rather crude invention used a magnet that was moved inside a coil of copper wire, creating a tiny electric current that flowed through the wire. This opened the door to American Thomas Edison and British scientist Joseph Swan who each invented the incandescent filament light bulb in their respective countries in about 1878. And so, it was not just one person who discovered electricity. While the concept of electricity was known for thousands of years, when it came time to develop it commercially and scientifically, there were several great minds working on the problem at the same time.

The first practical use of it was probably to power the telegraph, which made possible the near-instantaneous transmission of messages. The Columbia Exposition of 1892 popularized the use of electricity to create light and banish darkness from the night. Most people know that Thomas Edison is credited with inventing the first practical lightbulb, but not as many people know that Nicola Tesla, after whom the Tesla electric car was named, created a system of electricity called Alternating Current, or A.C., that was superior to the Direct Current (DC) system developed by Edison. He also developed a means of transmitting electric power through the air wirelessly. Though Edison was a much better businessman than Tesla, Westinghouse promoted & developed AC and Tesla\u2019s A.C. system became predominant and is the one used today. Edison and the investors in his company became very rich, while Tesla spent his final days in a hotel room, supported by a small stipend from the Czech government. ",

It was recognized (some say, \"discovered\") in many ways by many people over the centuries in the forms of static electricity, electric eels, catfish and lightning (a really, really BIG form of static electricity discharge.) There's also some question of when electricity was first put to use by human beings.  Certain ceramic jars have been speculated to be experiments in storage batteries (see Baghdad Battery in Wikipedia) but the idea is not well supported. The first definite use of electricity was probably in its avoidance.  Lightning rods channel electricity directly to ground, reducing the likelihood of fires on buildings and ships and was described by Benjamin Franklin in 1749.   ",

Like most inventions, electricity (or, rather, the devices that allow us to generate and exploit electricity,) is the product of the inquisitive and inventive minds of many. Each has built their invention on the knowledge of their predecessors. A few well-known discoverers and inventors that get a lot of credit for developing electricity as we know it: Allesandra Volta \u2014 developer of the electrochemical batteryCharles-Augustin de Coulomb \u2014 described the mechanics of electrical charges (capacitors)Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re \u2014 investigated and described the relationship between magnetism and electricity (generators)Benjamin Franklin \u2014 investigated and described the relationship between lightning and electricityNikola Tesla \u2014 contributed to the design of alternating current generation, distribution, and useGeorge Westinghouse \u2014 funded the development of AC generation and distribution; worked closely with TeslaThomas Edison \u2014 contributed to the design of direct current generation, distribution, and useOver the years many unsung people have contributed to advancing electrical technology, either contributing to or building on the works of the above and many since. The development continues.  An interesting side note: the \u201cwatt\u201d, a measurement of power, was named for James Watt, developer of the first successful steam engine. Even though he had little or nothing to do with electricity, his name lives on as a unit most commonly associated with electric power! ",

            "answer_text": "Electricity is a natural phenomenon. It had no use until the British scientist Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction, proving that electricity and magnetism were related. In 1831 he built the first direct-current electric generator for converting manual into electrical force. By reversing the process he created the first electric motor. By winding wire coils around an iron framework he created the transformer. He almost single-handedly created the modern world: controlled electricity allowed the invention of the telegraph, which soon linked all parts of the world, and the telephone, which ultimately led to the gadget so many people find indispensable today. Faraday cages protect critical computer and electrical equipment from electromagnetic surges, solar flares and the like all over the world. In spite of the magnitude of his discoveries and inventions, he is almost unknown outside the scientific community. Albert Einstein had his picture on the wall of his office. Thomas Edison revered him, as did Nikola Tesla, Ernest Rutherford and other giants of science. ",

            "answer_text": "Like some mentioned, Electricity wasn\u2019t invented but discovered. And the leading person who achieved that was Benjamin Franklin. We give him credit for it since his experiments helped establish the connection between electricity and lightning. In 1752 he experimented with a kite to discover that the connection between lightning and tiny electric sparks were the same thing. Truth be told, electricity was actually discovered by the Ancient Greeks according to our records. So many people actually discovered electricity, so we can\u2019t really give you a simplified and straight answer on this. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Electricity is a form of energy that occurs naturally, it was not invented so much as it was discovered. While it is likely many folks observed static discharge on dry days, but it was the Ancient Greek philosopher, Thales of Miletus that left us the earliest descriptions of the effect. Prior to that however, people were aware of shocks from electric fish and from lightning although there was no broad theory linking all these observations together until the 17th century, when several prominent researchers began to examine the phenomena and established the scientific foundations to the field.

Michael Faraday came up the dynamo which can be said to be the first practical application although it was highly inefficient.The big breakthrough came with the discovery of AC. With AC, power can be distributed efficiently at high voltage down a power line but controlled by a transformer at the other end. This means that households and businesses can tap into it without getting the high voltage. ",

He was knighted for creating the first working electrical telegraph about 1816. It took about two decades to implement his invention. Later after a British scientist, Sir Joseph Swan, invented an incandescent light bulb, lighting was also an early use of electricity, installed in the early 1880s.
