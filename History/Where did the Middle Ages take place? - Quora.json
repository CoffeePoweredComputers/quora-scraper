            "answer_text": "hmmm \u2026 except for Allan, most of the current answers focus on when did the middle ages start. But that\u2019s not the question. The question is why. There are two ways to approach this. The first is probably the more accurate, the second depends on one\u2019s interpretation. The best answer I can come up with is that people have a natural tendency to catalog and categorize things. In some ways this makes a great deal of sense. It allows one to deal with something very large and ungainly - such as the history of mankind - by breaking it down into smaller, much easier to understand and discuss blocks of time. Thus the why did they start? It is simply easier to discuss that time, within the bounds of its characteristic cultures, technologies and belief systems, by defining it as occurring between X and Y (both debatable and varying depending on where you look in the world or what scholarly teachings you prefer) and giving it a name. Giving it a name is always subjective - especially in this case. For example, the term Dark Ages had nothing to do with a lack of invention and scholarly study (indeed the previous period was actually less progressive than what followed) and more concerned with the Renaissance folks wanting to set themselves above the previous period. While you can define a period as the Dark Ages the period of time traditionally described, in actuality, was neither dark nor backwards nor somehow unsophisticated. Kind of like every generation has its own \u201cGolden Age\u201d. On a side note, in my own field we have something called \u201cPost Modern Architecture\u201d which is another nonsensical historical designation. Come on \u2026 modern is the time period we are currently living is. How can anything be post modern without time-travel? Think about it - when the Acropolis was built, it was \u2026 uhm \u2026 modern architecture. The second way to answer the question is to not look at when but what occurred in history that caused major transition. The problem with this is the word transition - transitions in history are things that happen over time. Thus it is very difficult to say \u2018on such and such a date we transitioned from the \u2018classical age\u2019 to the \u2018middle ages\u2019. The why is a much more complex thing without a single, simple answer. Of course things contributed to it - the decentralization of power after Rome and the Pax Romana. agricultural developments that could support a change in social structures, philosophy and theology changes that happened when the West met the East, a return to intellectual investigation, changes in trade and trade routes \u2026 and when you look at the big picture the \u201cwhy\u201d becomes not a simple single instance but rather, and more importantly, the why of the Middle Ages becomes just the natural and continual development of knowledge, technology and philosophy of mankind over time.

            "answer_text": "There is no why as to the beginning or end of an historical period. Historians place markers for convenience, selecting events that signal changes, even though those changes would not have been immediately apparent to those living at the time. The Middle Ages presents a rather difficult exercise in historical periodicity. To begin with, the term, and the related Dark Ages, is an extrapolation from a letter of Petrarch, in which he defined a coming new beginning that would revive classical antiquity after a period of darkness\u2014a metaphorical statement that unfortunately became literalized by some historians. At the broadest definition, we start the Middle Ages either at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 or 480 AD (depending on whether you consider Romulus Augustalis or Julius Nepos as the last Emperor) or with the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor on December 25, 800 AD, both dates being largely symbolic. The great medieval historian Henri Pirenne noted that the institutions of the Western empire were largely subsummed by the Ostrogothic kings who ruled Italy, and shifting patterns of trade and the rise of the ancestors of modern European states made the coronation of Charlemagne a more logical historical break\u2014still symbolic. There is another more modern perspective which overlaps the early part of the Middle Ages with the concept of Late Antiquity. In any case, historian now generally do not use the term Dark Ages. The lights did not go out all over Europe between (depending on your perspective) 476 AD and 800 AD (Charlemagne) or the Ottonian Renaissance (or, more correctly, following Panofsy, renascence) of the mid-10th century. In any case, there is a general agreement that the 11th century marks the beginning of the High Middle Ages, the full flowering of medieval civilization, which, for the purpose of periodization, we arbitrarily can end with any number of events in the 14th or 15th centuries, from Petrarch\u2019s ascent of Mont Ventoux to Brunelleschi\u2019s start on the chruch of San Lorenzo in 1422. Moreover, the ideas of the Renaissance spread through Europe gradually; we usually don\u2019t talk about the English Renaissance until the very end of the 15th century or the beginning of the 16th. What is conventionally called the Middle Ages, in reality, is probably at least three distinct by related periods, given some commonality in a foundation in the Western Church, Latin literature, the growth of feudalism, and a few other items\u2014Late Antiquity, the early Middle Ages, and the High Middle Ages, none of which were a fall back into barbarism, although the 5th though the 7th century were turbulent\u2014a consequence of the collapse of the overall organizing structure of the Western Empire. If this sounds complicated\u2014it is. It is about 1000 years of European history, full of enormous complexity, and it is the foundation of modern civilization. I hope I haven\u2019t confused you more. But there isn\u2019t a simple answer. ",
