            "answer_text": "Well first of all, questions like this seem to indicate a mentality that there is a \u201cfront line\u201d where combat is constantly occurring. Let\u2019s get rid of that notion. There are areas with more activity and areas that generally have very low activity, but the idea of a front line doesn\u2019t lend itself well to modern warfare. Let\u2019s also make it clear that no matter where you are, combat is not the time to change a tampon. If you\u2019re being shot at, that\u2019s going to be pretty far from your mind. So whether this takes place on patrol or at a base, it\u2019s going to happen during a period of downtime. Anyway, if you can defecate (which both men and women have to do), you can change a tampon. Some people find isolated locations to do it. Isolated may mean \u201chey guys I\u2019m going on the other side of the truck for a moment\u201d and generally people understand that means they need a moment of privacy or it could mean going into a tent, behind a tree, inside a latrine (if one was available), etc. Some people just don\u2019t care. When you spend enough time with a small group of people (as tends to happen if you\u2019re in an area where you can\u2019t find that sort of privacy), you get comfortable with them. Men and women both may end up changing clothes, relieving themselves, or doing other things around a group of people that would never be considered acceptable in public back home. ",

            "answer_text": "Many of us get hormonal IUD\u2019s (intrauterine devices). It is a form of birth control that releases progestogen from a small device inside the uterus. It is inserted by a doctor and provides birth control for 5 years. One of the common \u201cside effects\u201d is that one will not menstruate during this time. If one wishes to have children, the IUD can be removed by a doctor at any time. Having said that, I spent several years in the military before having this miraculous little device and having my period in the field was really not as big a deal as many people assume. Everyone goes to the bathroom. I would just also change my tampon when going to the washroom. If no bathrooms were available, I would either bury my feminine waste, in the same fashion that I would for a poop, or I would put it in a zip-lock that comes in our ration packs and dispose of it with the garbage from my ration at the next opportunity. At the end of the day, WAY easier than having to shave my face every morning and get haircuts every couple of weeks. Male soldiers are so high-maintenance ;) ",
