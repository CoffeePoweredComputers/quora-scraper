            "answer_text": "As much as I hated to, I couldn\u2019t have lived with myself had I not answered this. Also, thank you for not asking cowardly, anonymously. I don\u2019t know where you reside or what you\u2019ve been through, but here is your answer: First, Operation Pied Piper did NOT evacuate EVERY person. In fact, for the millions that were evacuated, there were millions that were not ( for various reasons). So it wasn\u2019t a blanket evacuation of the country/area. For the same reasons that many were not evacuated in Britain, many in New Orleans CHOSE not to leave. Even though authorities may call for a mandatory evacuation, the government has not the power, nor the manpower to go house-to-house and physically take people from their homes to an evacuation site. The City of New Orleans and the state provided buses and other means of transportation (primarily for those who had no resources [financial or otherwise]) to evacuate on their own. Additionally, the city and state and FEMA provided transportation to and evacuation sites in neighboring areas for evacuees. This included being able to stay in most hotels and motels if you had an ID with certain Louisiana zip codes for free, as well as no tolls on the roadways to these places, meals, and debit cards (thanks to the Red Cross) with an average $1,300 on it, and more. But many people didn\u2019t take advantage of these offers. Why? Several reasons, including: The majority of the population were not old enough to have gone through the last two SUPER-hurricanes that destroyed New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast\u2014 Betsy and Camille. There had been numerous (and I mean, NUMEROUS) storms up to the point of Katrina, many serious, but nothing catastrophic. Therefore, these younger residents took the attitude of, \u201cEhhhh. Just another bad storm. I(t)\u2019ll be alright\u201d. Some of the elderly and infirm weren\u2019t able to leave their homes and had no one to help them do so. Many died in those same homes. Many people (when the flooding came [unrelated directly to the storm\u2014 see below]) climbed into their attics, only to be trapped and die there as well. But, let\u2019s look further. The storm started to take effect in the city about 4 a.m. Monday morning. The last TV station on the air (WDSU, channel 6) said its goodbyes, and went off. The winds started. It was bad. REAL bad. As hurricanes go. And, I\u2019ve been through many. But, not catastrophic in that sense. The next day: Beautiful. Sunny, clear blue skies. Signs and trees down. A few building facades crumbled. Nothing horrific. And then, it began\u2014 the water. It started as just a trickle where I was in Central City (not too far from the center of downtown), and within about an hour, filled up the entire street. Before long (as is history now), the entire city was flooded. On TV, we watched in horror as the Army Corps, among others, tried desperately but with no success to drop shipping containers by the dozens into a break in the 17th Street Canal in an attempt to seal it. And keep in mind that New Orleans sits about 5 feet below sea level in a virtual bowl. So, to answer your question fully, many did not leave for the reasons listed above. The storm was just that; another bad storm. No one anticipated or had any idea or a plan for the flooding that ensued the next day from a break in the canal (which purportedly was from an unsecured barge hitting the levee of the canal), which forced hundreds of thousands out of their homes. The storm was over! Many (most?) people went to the Superdome for refuge. Bad idea. The Superdome is a sports facility. It became a haven for rapes, robberies, gangs and crimes of all sorts, as the tragedy went on for months and the Superdome is virtually a city in itself. Many got up on the overpasses and bridges. Bad idea. No supplies, shelter, etc., So, what to do? That\u2019s right. No one knew because no one expected this break, this flooding. This had never happened before. And all, AFTER the storm. Keep in mind that the folks in Britain had a different motivation to evacuate: War. And, bombings. Big difference. Near certain death and destruction vs Mother Nature. Katrina was pretty horrific in many ways, changed a lot of things here and the way a lot of things are done. Of course, it will never be forgotten. To this day, people refer to things as, \u201c\u2026before Katrina, or after Katrina\u2026?\u201d. But, one thing is for sure. We learned. And, others learned from what we learned. And, it prevented many deaths and much damage in later storms. ",

            "answer_text": "Operation Pied Piper took four days to evacuate the children from London. London has a number of roads and highways leading from it. New Orleans proper had about 650,000 people; Jefferson Parish has even more, not to mention other parishes adjacent that comprise metro New Orleans. That\u2019s a lot of people to move. Complicating this, there are just five major roads available to handle the traffic out of the city. We\u2019re surrounded by lakes, rivers and marshes, so the land available to build highways just isn\u2019t there. Most hurricanes do not follow the rules and once in the South Atlantic, it can take just three or four days to make landfall. Few of the hurricanes that develop and cross the Equator end up hitting New Orleans. While the government does its best to get people out, including using buses to take people who don\u2019t have a car available, evacuating New Orleans is pretty impossible, giving that many people want to stay in their homes. I\u2019ve lived in New Orleans all of my life, and Katrina is the first storm I evacuated for. I don\u2019t even consider leaving for a Cat 3; if the storm reaches Cat 4 or 5, I\u2019ll probably pack up the dogs and go. If you have a plan that can predict for certain that a hurricane is going to make a direct hit on New Orleans five or six days ahead, I\u2019d like to hear it. New Orleanians are stubborn people who don\u2019t like to desert their homes. My home had a few slates off the roof, but it didn\u2019t flood and we came home at the end of October without a hitch. We still had problems with natural gas pressure (cold showers), but the electricity had been restored and the the flooding in my neighborhood was only about 18 inches. Our home is built on 4-foot brick pilings, so no water didn\u2019t get into the house. Even at two months out, city service were limited. No street lights, stop lights, few groceries and gas stations were available. The Louisiana National Guard was still patrolling the city to supplement the police. Few of our neighbors had returned. It was kind of spooky because the city was so deserted. BTW, we wouldn\u2019t have had such widespread flooding uptown had the 17th Street outflow canal not undermined its levee. Thank you, Corps of Engineers. There was no excuse for that because there were concrete signs that the levee could be breached months before. ",
