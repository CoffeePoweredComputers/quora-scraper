            "answer_text": "The long pontificate of John Paul II with his charisma and popularity obscured this reality, shielding entrenched financial corruption and a hierarchy increasingly out of step with the modern world, though not even he could ignore the gathering tsunami of sexual abuse and cover-up. As the scale of the problem emerged, Europe in particular suffered. Recruitment to the priesthood and closed orders dropped radically. Over the last 15 years in Ireland, Spain and especially in Italy, churches seemed to grow bigger as congregations grew smaller. And older - the dwindling of numbers a particular problem when it comes to women who, ironically given their lack of power, have traditionally kept the flame alive in the family. Worldwide, the numbers of Catholics may still look healthy, but in Europe, the center of its history and government, there is clearly a crisis. In the real world, Francis' milder reforms have already hit a bedrock of opposition. If that old adage learning from history has any meaning, one can only look in awe to another historical parallel, this one within the Church itself 500 years ago. The sins around 1515 were largely the same - humanity remains fond of two in particular - fornication and avarice. Popes had children, cardinals had mistresses, priests had housekeepers, monks occasionally had each other and childhood, which effectively ended at 12 or 13, was fair game to those in power whatever their proclivity. Financial corruption was systemic. Palaces, parties, patronage - the use of Church money to feather the nests of those working for it makes the recent scandal of the German bishop with his 15,000-euro bath tub look like a visit to Homebase. Looking back on it now you might argue that part of that outrageous wealth went into great art; stand in the middle of the Sistine Chapel and weigh up charity against beauty. The truly egregious fault was less what they did with it than how they got it - selling indulgences and auctioning offices in an ever-expanding bureaucracy. Then, as now, there were voices pushing for reform. The Church has always had a strong pull towards the Franciscan vision - poverty and humility against ceremony and authority. Years before the election of our modern Pope Francis, Carlo Maria Martini, cardinal and archbishop of Milan, was openly critical of the Church's stance on sexuality and contraception. In a final interview before his death in 2012 he called for a radical transformation, beginning with the pope and his bishops. Pope Benedict did not attend his funeral. Meanwhile in America, nuns were devoting more of their time to pastoral and social work outside the cloisters, only to find themselves under papal investigation to root out \"certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith\". Francis's election in March 2013 took place 500 years almost to the day after that of Leo X. Son of Lorenzo de Medici and a career churchman (he was cardinal at 18), his comment on winning - accurate in spirit if not his actual words - was \"since God has given us the papacy, let us enjoy it\". So the pope \"fiddled\" as Rome started to burn. The spark of course came from Germany four years later when the Augustinian Martin Luther took reform into his own hands. Among the many broadsides he launched, perhaps the most significant in terms of the crisis today was against celibacy (he went on to marry a nun). The Catholic Church's response through the counter-reformation was retrenchment. The doctrine of celibacy - singleness and sexual purity - would continue. Fast forward to October 2015, when the Polish priest and theologian Krzysztof Charamsa, gay and proud with his partner, left the curia by means of a press conference on the eve of the family synod, accusing the Church of hypocrisy and homophobia. Who could doubt his honesty? Or the viper's nest of infighting it revealed inside the Vatican? Behind the critique of the gay lobby is a much deeper one. Men may truly believe in God but for most of them chastity is too big an ask and if enforced, leads, at worst, to abuse and at best to a clergy and hierarchy ignorant of, and often unsympathetic to, the problems of being human. From there it's but a skip and a jump to the role of women and their exclusion from the heart of the Church. History again is the key. By denying the sacramental nature of the priesthood, the reformation gave women, potentially at least, a bigger voice. Even at its most conservative - think Victorian Anglicanism - the vicar's wife was still in his bed, mothering his children and shouldering parish duties, often specializing in compassion and charity. Thus when the second wave of feminism hit, hand in hand with gay politics, women had less distance to climb into the pulpit, though their ascent caused some Anglican minsters to convert to Catholicism, swelling the ranks of the conservatives. Has the Catholic Church really changed? ",

            "answer_text": "I will speak for myself as I know this can be a hot button topic. I was born in 1960 about the time the changes with Vatican II started. I have a vague memory of the Tridentine Mass and we get glimpses of it in the Novus Ordo form of the Mass we experience today. I believe the change from Latin has made the Mass more understandable to us though I can appreciate the Latin Mass. I also believe allowing the laity to become more involved with the liturgy has engaged them into the faith better. Due to the lack of religious we need the laity anyway. I mentioned to an older group of Catholics that I hardly remembered pre-Vatican II and they said 'good' because apparently there was a lot of controversy over the change so I was lucky to miss out on that. I suppose if you never experienced it you wouldn't miss it as much so as time goes on the feeling of loss won't be as great..:( Still I believe she is the same Church given to us by God and it's not unusual for changes over time. She's still the same Church built for the people to be led to God through Jesus. The language may be different and the surroundings but it's still made up of the Church which is people not the surroundings, though I don't want to belittle the importance of sacred spaces to our faith. Moses wouldn't dare do that \u2018On that Holy Mountain\u2026':) I believe people in general in first world countries like the US, much of Europe and Canada have sadly left the faith because of the new age religions and self enlightenment AND the population in general has decreased because of birth control and abortion and wanting to put off families, so that effects the amount of the faithful. We're seeing that in our public school system as well. There is just not as many people being born so it's changing dynamics. The problem here is there won't be any one to support the aging population. So really what we see happening among the faithful and the general population is not necessarily a step in the right direction. People need people or they will die out. The Church is experiencing growth in third world countries who \u2018are aware' they need God, and that's where the future is not only for the Church but for the planet. I believe the Church is trying to keep up with times and stay faithful to the truths of Jesus Christ given to the Apostles and passed down through the Church. She's still relatively new at Novus Ordo in relationship to the 2000 year history of the Church but is doing a good job of it. There are some pretty wonderful things going on. Our Lord isn't finished with her yet!.\u2665\ufe0f ",

This is Christ\u2019s Church\u2026we live by what He wants first. in the last 50 years, I believe that our church has become more responsive to the people\u2026best example, turning the priest toward the people and use of the vernacular language. We don\u2019t have nearly so many priests and nuns as we used to\u2026but with the addition of many married deacons\u2026a great development. With fewer clergy and religious (professed nuns and brothers), the lay people have become so much more involved and engaged in their parishes. This is another splendid side to what has happened with fewer professed men and women in our churches and schools. A small change was in the dropping of the requirement that we abstain from meat on Fridays, only required now on Ash Wednesday and Fridays during Lent. That doesn\u2019t mean we are to dispense with fasting or some difficulty. We now are to do it on our own\u2026we are to take responsibility for this. We seem to be more engaged with each other now in our parishes and more aware of our responsibilities to people in general. We have lost people in our numbers, but so much is due to society at large sadly. I really believe the members we have in the present time are more aware of the tremendous blessings we have been given as Catholic Christians and are anxious to live and to share our faith with others.
