            "answer_text": "Being old-fashioned has ALWAYS been mocked by the next generation. Furthermore, we oldsters always believe the old ways are the best and the younger generation is, if you\u2019ll pardon the word, degenerating. Please remember that when my parents were born, the KKK was supported by states\u2019 governors and marched through Washington D.C. They were lynching blacks and attacking Catholics and Jews and immigrants who came here after World War I. In addition, women couldn\u2019t vote. Were those the good old days? When I was born, black people still had to ride in the back of the bus, eat at \u201cblack\u201d restaurants, watch movies at \u201cblack\u201d theaters, use only \u201cblack\u201d rest rooms. Were those the good old days? In my generation, the Civil Rights Era had to turn to violence to earn rights that were guaranteed to all of us in the Declaration of Independence. Remember? \u201c\u2026all men are created Equal\u201d? I mocked my parents\u2019 old-fashioned ways as I turned to rock-and-roll and the joys of computers. But now the next generation laughs when I use e-mail instead of text\u2014come on, guys, e-mail can be saved and copied into a document and turned into a diary, don\u2019t you see the value? I used to teach my co-workers how to use Word, and now the youngsters have to teach me how to use the newfangled technology of today. Were we really good Christians and well-behaved people when we used words like \u201ckike\u201d and \u201cspic\u201d and \u201cn- - - - r\u201d? Of course the new ways aren\u2019t always right. We\u2019re humans. We\u2019re bound to screw up. But when you ask \u201cwhat is so bad about being old-fashioned\u2019 I have to respond, \u201cwhat is so bad about being modern?\u201d Strive to improve. Set a good example, and praise what is good instead of wailing for the way things used to be. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not always bad to be \u201cold-fashioned,\u201d but when people think of old-fashioned, it\u2019s usually a connotation for someone who, for example, emails instead of texts or does things \u201ctheir way\u201d instead of doing it an easier way. It\u2019s mostly millennials criticizing baby bloomers for sometimes being a bit stubborn when it comes to adapting to new things or technology. But being old-fashioned doesn\u2019t have to be bad all the time. If you still own a VHS like I do, more power to you, you can still watch old films (of course my definition of old may be different from others) that used VCR\u2019s. And especially when it comes to fashion, this generation has brought back many styles: mom jeans, scrunchies, high-legged cut bathing suits, wide-legged pants, and more. These are the items that are becoming more and more trendy. Hope this helps :) ",
