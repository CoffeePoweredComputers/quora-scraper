            "answer_text": "Stalin had no plans to invade Germany. He really believed in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. More so than most of his staff. Maybe the Red Army had plans drawn up, (most armies war game any contingency) but Stalin had no intention of attacking Germany.As the German forces moved into the Soviet Union a train loaded with goods from the Russians passed them on the way into Germany. Stalin was still sending supplies right up until the last minute.Stalin was generally suspicious of everyone and a very shrewd political chess player, but this was a major lapse in his thinking. For some reason, even though he had been told in advance, he just refused to believe it. It\u2019s likely that the only way Stalin would have attacked Germany would have been if there had been a coup and Hitler overthrown, and he saw a favourable opportunity to attack while the Germans were confused.If Hitler had waited it is likely that Stalin would have finally came to the conclusion that Germany planned to attack, and would have given the Soviets time to prepare. The reason Hitler made such massive gains in the opening months of Barbarossa is because the Soviets were totally unprepared, and once the invasion started Stalin was in such shock that he hid himself away in his dacha for almost a fortnight before he picked himself up and got things moving to resist the German forces.

            "answer_text": "The Germany would have lost a war of attrition. If Germany waited for the Soviet Union to attack they would have left the Soviet Supply lines nice and safe. Essentially, even if Germany managed to take a whopping 10km of land from the now prepared Russian army, it would be meaningless considering the size of Russia. In addition Germany would be fighting too close to their oil reserves in Romania and the Russians would still have an air-force, and much more! In the way the war took place in 1941, Germany destroyed the entire Russian army in the first year. All of their tanks, most of their equipment and millions of their trained soldiers were lost before the end of 1941. ",
