            "answer_text": "That distinction would probably go to the Comanche, who believed in fighting to the death, and for that reason were the last native American tribe to be subdued by the whites. When they attacked, they killed the male captives after first torturing them, and they raped women captives before killing them as well. They also weren't above killing babies, although slightly older children, too young to resist, were often adopted into the tribe. The book Empire of the Summer Moon describes some of their gruesome tortures and tells the story of a white girl in her late teens who survived the massacre of her family, only to be captured by the Comanche and taken to their village. As the braves and the girl rode toward their destination, her fright caused her to have an attack of diarrhea. Her Comanche name became Smells Bad on a Horse. ",

One Apache alone was a dangerous war party, and as a small tribe, they paralyzed New Mexico and Arizona prior to American administration. As a tribe taking part in wars, The Six Nations of the Iroquois had no equal. Even though they outnumbered the Iroquois 6 or 7 to 1, the Sioux were beaten by them every time they fought. The Hurons were virtually wiped out by them, and the Erie Indians were literally wiped out to the last person by them. ",
