            "answer_text": "You might be asking because of the extremist fanatical view some religious people have from the Bible account of Genesis\u2026if that\u00b4s the case\u2026 How Long Is a Genesis \u201cDay\u201d? Many consider the word \u201cday\u201d used in Genesis chapter 1 to mean 24 hours. However, in Genesis 1:5 God himself is said to divide day into a smaller period of time, calling just the light portion \u201cday.\u201d In Genesis 2:4 all the creative periods are called one \u201cday\u201d: \u201cThis is a history of the heavens and the earth in the time of their being created, in the day [all six creative periods] that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.\u201d The Hebrew word yohm, translated \u201cday,\u201d can mean different lengths of time. Among the meanings possible, William Wilson\u2019s Old Testament Word Studies includes the following: \u201cA day; it is frequently put for time in general, or for a long time; a whole period under consideration . . . Day is also put for a particular season or time when any extraordinary event happens.\u201d1 This last sentence appears to fit the creative \u201cdays,\u201d for certainly they were periods when extraordinary events were described as happening. It also allows for periods much longer than 24 hours. Genesis chapter 1 uses the expressions \u201cevening\u201d and \u201cmorning\u201d relative to the creative periods. Does this not indicate that they were 24 hours long? Not necessarily. In some places people often refer to a man\u2019s lifetime as his \u201cday.\u201d They speak of \u201cmy father\u2019s day\u201d or \u201cin Shakespeare\u2019s day.\u201d They may divide up that lifetime \u201cday,\u201d saying \u201cin the morning [or dawn] of his life\u201d or \u201cin the evening [or twilight] of his life.\u201d So \u2018evening and morning\u2019 in Genesis chapter 1 does not limit the meaning to a literal 24 hours. \u201cDay\u201d as used in the Bible can include summer and winter, the passing of seasons. (Zechariah 14:8) \u201cThe day of harvest\u201d involves many days. (Compare Proverbs 25:13 and Genesis 30:14.) A thousand years are likened to a day. (Psalm 90:4; 2 Peter 3:8, 10) \u201cJudgment Day\u201d covers many years. (Matthew 10:15; 11:22-24) It would seem reasonable that the \u201cdays\u201d of Genesis could likewise have embraced long periods of time\u2014millenniums. Want to know more?\u2026 Well let\u00b4s brake it down: First \u201cDay\u201d \u201c\u2018Let light come to be.\u2019 Then there came to be light. And God began calling the light Day, but the darkness he called Night. And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, a first day.\u201d\u2014Genesis 1:3, 5. Of course the sun and moon were in outer space long before this first \u201cday,\u201d but their light did not reach the surface of the earth for an earthly observer to see. Now, light evidently came to be visible on earth on this first \u201cday,\u201d and the rotating earth began to have alternating days and nights. Apparently, the light came in a gradual process, extending over a long period of time, not instantaneously as when you turn on an electric light bulb. The Genesis rendering by translator J. W. Watts reflects this when it says: \u201cAnd gradually light came into existence.\u201d (A Distinctive Translation of Genesis) This light was from the sun, but the sun itself could not be seen through the overcast. Hence, the light that reached earth was \u201clight diffused,\u201d as indicated by a comment about verse 3 in Rotherham\u2019s Emphasised Bible.\u2014See footnote b for verse 14. Second \u201cDay\u201d \u201c\u2018Let an expanse come to be in between the waters and let a dividing occur between the waters and the waters.\u2019 Then God proceeded to make the expanse and to make a division between the waters that should be beneath the expanse and the waters that should be above the expanse. And it came to be so. And God began to call the expanse Heaven.\u201d\u2014Genesis 1:6-8. Some translations use the word \u201cfirmament\u201d instead of \u201cexpanse.\u201d From this the argument is made that the Genesis account borrowed from creation myths that represent this \u201cfirmament\u201d as a metal dome. But even the King James Version Bible, which uses \u201cfirmament,\u201d says in the margin, \u201cexpansion.\u201d This is because the Hebrew word ra\u00b7qi\u02b9a\u201b, translated \u201cexpanse,\u201d means to stretch out or spread out or expand. The Genesis account says that God did it, but it does not say how. In whatever way the described separation occurred, it would look as though the \u2018waters above\u2019 had been pushed up from the earth. And birds could later be said to fly in \u201cthe expanse of the heavens,\u201d as stated at Genesis 1:20. Third \u201cDay\u201d \u201c\u2018Let the waters under the heavens be brought together into one place and let the dry land appear.\u2019 And it came to be so. And God began calling the dry land Earth, but the bringing together of the waters he called Seas.\u201d (Genesis 1:9, 10) As usual, the account does not describe how this was done. No doubt, tremendous earth movements would have been involved in the formation of land areas. Geologists would explain such major upheavals as catastrophism. But Genesis indicates direction and control by a Creator. In the Biblical account where God is described as questioning Job about his knowledge of the earth, a variety of developments concerning earth\u2019s history are described: its measurements, its cloud masses, its seas and how their waves were limited by dry land\u2014many things in general about the creation, spanning long periods of time. Among these things, comparing earth to a building, the Bible says that God asked Job: \u201cInto what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone?\u201d\u2014Job 38:6. Interestingly, like \u201csocket pedestals,\u201d earth\u2019s crust is much thicker under continents and even more so under mountain ranges, pushing deep into the underlying mantle, like tree roots into soil. \u201cThe idea that mountains and continents had roots has been tested over and over again, and shown to be valid,\u201d says Putnam\u2019s Geology.2 Oceanic crust is only about 5 miles thick, but continental roots go down about 20 miles and mountain roots penetrate about twice that far. And all earth\u2019s layers press inward upon earth\u2019s core from all directions, making it like a great \u201ccornerstone\u201d of support. Whatever means were used to accomplish the raising up of dry land, the important point is: Both the Bible and science recognize it as one of the stages in the forming of the earth. Land Plants on Third \u201cDay\u201d The Bible account adds: \u201c\u2018Let the earth cause grass to shoot forth, vegetation bearing seed, fruit trees yielding fruit according to their kinds, the seed of which is in it, upon the earth.\u2019 And it came to be so.\u201d\u2014Genesis 1:11. Thus by the close of this third creative period, three broad categories of land plants had been created. The diffused light would have become quite strong by then, ample for the process of photosynthesis so vital to green plants. Incidentally, the account here does not mention every \u201ckind\u201d of plant that came on the scene. Microscopic organisms, water plants and others are not specifically named, but likely were created on this \u201cday.\u201d Fourth \u201cDay\u201d \u201c\u2018Let luminaries come to be in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night; and they must serve as signs and for seasons and for days and years. And they must serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth.\u2019 And it came to be so. And God proceeded to make the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for dominating the day and the lesser luminary for dominating the night, and also the stars.\u201d\u2014Genesis 1:14-16; Psalm 136:7-9. Previously, on the first \u201cday,\u201d the expression \u201cLet light come to be\u201d was used. The Hebrew word there used for \u201clight\u201d is \u2019ohr, meaning light in a general sense. But on the fourth \u201cday,\u201d the Hebrew word changes to ma\u00b7\u2019ohr\u02b9, which means the source of the light. Rotherham, in a footnote on \u201cLuminaries\u201d in the Emphasised Bible, says: \u201cIn ver. 3, \u2019\u00f4r [\u2019ohr], light diffused.\u201d Then he goes on to show that the Hebrew word ma\u00b7\u2019ohr\u02b9 in verse 14 means something \u201caffording light.\u201d On the first \u201cday\u201d diffused light evidently penetrated the swaddling bands, but the sources of that light could not have been seen by an earthly observer because of the cloud layers still enveloping the earth. Now, on this fourth \u201cday,\u201d things apparently changed. An atmosphere initially rich in carbon dioxide may have caused an earth-wide hot climate. But the lush growth of vegetation during the third and fourth creative periods would absorb some of this heat-retaining blanket of carbon dioxide. The vegetation, in turn, would release oxygen\u2014a requirement for animal life. Now, had there been an earthly observer, he would be able to discern the sun, moon and stars, which would \u201cserve as signs and for seasons and for days and years.\u201d (Genesis 1:14) The moon would indicate the passing of lunar months, and the sun the passing of solar years. The seasons that now \u201ccame to be\u201d on this fourth \u201cday\u201d would no doubt have been much milder than they became later on.\u2014Genesis 1:15; 8:20-22. Fifth \u201cDay\u201d \u201c\u2018Let the waters swarm forth a swarm of living souls and let flying creatures fly over the earth upon the face of the expanse of the heavens.\u2019 And God proceeded to create the great sea monsters and every living soul that moves about, which the waters swarmed forth according to their kinds, and every winged flying creature according to its kind.\u201d\u2014Genesis 1:20, 21. It is of interest to note that the nonhuman creatures with which the waters were to swarm are called \u201cliving souls.\u201d This term would also apply to the \u201cflying creatures [that] fly over the earth upon the face of the expanse.\u201d And it would also embrace the forms of sea and air life, such as the sea monsters, whose fossil remains scientists have found in recent times. Sixth \u201cDay\u201d \u201c\u2018Let the earth put forth living souls according to their kinds, domestic animal and moving animal and wild beast of the earth according to its kind.\u2019 And it came to be so.\u201d\u2014Genesis 1:24. Thus on the sixth \u201cday,\u201d land animals characterized as wild and domestic appeared. But this final \u201cday\u201d was not over. One last remarkable \u201ckind\u201d was to come: \u201cAnd God went on to say: \u2018Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every moving animal that is moving upon the earth.\u2019 And God proceeded to create the man in his image, in God\u2019s image he created him; male and female he created them.\u201d\u2014Genesis 1:26, 27. Chapter 2 of Genesis apparently adds some details. However, it is not, as some have concluded, another account of creation in conflict with that of chapter 1. It just takes up at a point in the third \u201cday,\u201d after dry land appeared but before land plants were created, adding details that were pertinent to the arrival of humans\u2014Adam the living soul, his garden home, Eden, and the woman Eve, his wife.\u2014Genesis 2:5-9, 15-18, 21, 22. The foregoing is presented to help us understand what Genesis says. And this quite realistic account indicates that the creative process continued throughout a period of, not just 144 hours (6 \u00d7 24), but over many millenniums of time. How Did Genesis Know? Many find it hard to accept this creation account. They contend that it is drawn from the creation myths of ancient peoples, primarily those from ancient Babylon. However, as one recent Bible dictionary noted: \u201cNo myth has yet been found which explicitly refers to the creation of the universe\u201d and the myths \u201care marked by polytheism and the struggles of deities for supremacy in marked contrast to the Heb[rew] monotheism of [Genesis] 1-2.\u201d3 Regarding Babylonian creation legends, the trustees of the British Museum stated: \u201cThe fundamental conceptions of the Babylonian and Hebrew accounts are essentially different.\u201d4 From what we have considered, the Genesis creation account emerges as a scientifically sound document. It reveals the larger categories of plants and animals, with their many varieties, reproducing only \u201caccording to their kinds.\u201d The fossil record provides confirmation of this. In fact, it indicates that each \u201ckind\u201d appeared suddenly, with no true transitional forms linking it with any previous \u201ckind,\u201d as required by the evolution theory. All the knowledge of the wise men of Egypt could not have furnished Moses, the writer of Genesis, any clue to the process of creation. The creation myths of ancient peoples bore no resemblance to what Moses wrote in Genesis. Where, then, did Moses learn all these things? Apparently from someone who was there. The science of mathematical probability offers striking proof that the Genesis creation account must have come from a source with knowledge of the events. The account lists 10 major stages in this order: (1) a beginning; (2) a primitive earth in darkness and enshrouded in heavy gases and water; (3) light; (4) an expanse or atmosphere; (5) large areas of dry land; (6) land plants; (7) sun, moon and stars discernible in the expanse, and seasons beginning; (8) sea monsters and flying creatures; (9) wild and tame beasts, mammals; (10) man. Science agrees that these stages occurred in this general order. What are the chances that the writer of Genesis just guessed this order? The same as if you picked at random the numbers 1 to 10 from a box, and drew them in consecutive order. The chances of doing this on your first try are 1 in 3,628,800! So, to say the writer just happened to list the foregoing events in the right order without getting the facts from somewhere is not realistic. ",

            "answer_text": " \u201cBut, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\u201d 2 Peter 3:8 The context is the key to determining the correct understanding of this account, especially the comparison of a thousand years to one day. The context of 2 Peter 3 is the return of the Lord to deliver His people. Peter tells the persecuted believers that scoffers will come and mock the idea that the Lord will return. They will say something like, \u201cHe\u2019s been gone a long time; He\u2019s not ever coming back\u201d (verse 4). As Christians are persecuted and continue to look for the Lord to deliver them, it appears as though His coming is \u201cdelayed.\u201d Peter reminds the believers not to lose heart because God is working on a different timetable. For a human being, if something doesn\u2019t happen within a matter of years, then we may miss it. God, however, is not limited by the same constraints of time because \u201cthat one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\u201d  Consider the patience of Noah in building the Ark, The Bible does not specifically say how long it took Noah to build the ark. When Noah is first mentioned in Genesis 5:32, he is 500 years old. When Noah enters the ark, he is 600 years old. The time it took to build the ark would depend on how much time passed between Genesis 6:14, when God commanded Noah to build the ark; and Genesis 7:1, when God commanded Noah to enter the ark. Some estimate that it took Noah 120 years to build the ark, based on Genesis 6:3. Other estimates 100 years, based on Noah\u2019s age in Genesis 5:32 and his age in Genesis 7:6. Either way that's a long time to build a boat on dry land while being ridiculed.  Noah entered the ark in the 600th year of his life, on the 17th day of the 2nd month (Genesis 7:11-13). Noah left the ark on the 27th day of the 2nd month of the following year (Genesis 8:14-15). Therefore, assuming a lunar calendar of 360 days, Noah was on the ark for approximately 370 days. A long tome to be on a boat by mans standards. Time is simply not an issue with God because He has an unlimited amount of it. If the average person sees something in the store, it would make no difference whether it cost a penny or a dime, even though one is ten times more expensive than the other. If a billionaire wanted to buy a piece of property it might make no difference to him whether it cost $50,000 or $500,000 or even $5,000,000. This is the idea of the verse\u2014both a day and a thousand years are such miniscule amounts of time to God that it really makes no difference to Him.  If a person promises to do something, there is a finite amount of time available for him to keep that promise. If an elderly father promises to buy his son a home, there is a limited amount of time available for him to keep the promise. As year after year passes and he does not buy the home, the son may begin to wonder if he ever will. Ultimately, if the father dies before keeping the promise and does not leave the son anything in his will, then the promise has expired. We must not look at the promises of God through the lens of human time. If God is working a plan that will take ten thousand years to unfold, it is no different to Him than if His plan took 10 days to unfold. The point of 2 Peter 3 is that, no matter how long it takes, God will keep His word\u2014\u201cThe Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\u201d (verse 9)\u2014specifically, He will return one day to judge the world and reconcile His people. The fact that it has not happened yet is absolutely no indication that He will not do it.  As people with eternal life, Christians need to adopt an eternal perspective on time. We have all eternity before us to receive the promises of God. We need not fret if it looks like our lives may end before we get everything we have been promised. If the Lord does not come back for another 50,000 years, that is less than two months (sixty \u201cdays\u201d), using a literal reckoning of verse 8. The main point is that given the amount of time available to Him, time is just not a concern. Some who hold to old earth creationism use 2 Peter 3:8 to bolster their view that the \u201cdays\u201d of Genesis 1 were not literal days but long eons of time. If \u201ca day is like a thousand years,\u201d the reasoning goes, then the word day in the creation narrative cannot mean a literal, twenty-four-hour day. The problem is that God is not attempting to redefine our words in 2 Peter 3:8. Peter does not say that one day is a thousand years; he says that one day is like a thousand years. In other words, he is using figurative language to make his point. The point is not that we should interpret the word day as \u201ca thousand years\u201d everywhere we find it in Scripture; rather, the point is that the passing of time has no bearing on God\u2019s faithfulness to His promises. He is \u201cthe same yesterday and today and forever\u201d (Hebrews 13:8). Besides, the day-age theory requires much more than 6,000 years in the creation \u201cweek.\u201d  Others also interpretations of 2 Peter 3:8 use a literal, mathematical equation. Some who hold to young earth creationism estimate that Earth has been around for 6,000 years or, according to the mathematical equation in 2 Peter 3:8, about six \u201cdays.\u201d Seven is the number of perfection and completion, this view considers the whole of human history will last one week\u2014that is, seven days (7,000 years). This view considers the millennial kingdom of 1,000 years as the seventh day of rest and that the seventh day is still to come and will be inaugurated by the Lord\u2019s return. It presumes we have already been on Earth for 6 days, then the Lord must return soon. Some go further in their calculations and set specific dates\u2014which is always an exercise in folly. \u201cWatch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.\u201d Matthew 25:13  While the \u201cseven-day theory\u201d looks attractive given our particular point in history\u2014about 6,000 years in, or somewhere near the end of the sixth day\u2014it goes against the spirit of the verse. The whole point of the passage is that we cannot know when the Lord will return because He is operating on a different timetable. 2 Peter 3:8 does not give us a cryptic equation to enable us to figure out when He will return. If that were the case, it would seem that Peter would have been able to figure it out and could simply have told the persecuted believers that the Lord would return in about 2,000 years. He didn\u2019t do that because he didn\u2019t know when the Lord would return. And neither do we. We need to wait as patiently for the Lord as the persecuted believers of the first century did. (2 Peter 3:11\u201312). ",
