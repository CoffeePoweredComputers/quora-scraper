            "answer_text": "Most popular depictions of Cleopatra show her as an exotic Middle Eastern beauty, but not only was she not considered particularly attractive but she was actually Greek/Macedonian not Egyptian.  The Ptolemaic dynasty adopted the trappings of Egyptian royalty and were portrayed as such to the Egyptian people, but they kept themselves isolated from the local population for generations and continued to speak Greek and practice Greek culture and religion.  Cleopatra was actually the first of her dynasty to bother to even learn the Egyptian language, that's how isolated they were from their subjects.  Alexandria under the Ptolemies was the center of Greek learning (you've probably heard of the Library of Alexandria).  At the time, Greek was also the preferred language of the Roman aristocracy and Greek poetry and philosophy was their favorite hobby.  So Caesar and Antony were probably not so much attracted to her exotic looks which a Roman wouldn't consider exotic, but probably more to her Greek education.  Roman women weren't given the same classical Greek education that noble men were, so she could hold her own in manly discussions of Greek poetry that their wives couldn't. ",

            "answer_text": "She was an exceedingly well educated and intelligent woman. She is supposed to have spoken 9 languages, but as with all the Ptolemies her mother-tongue was Greek.  Her name is the most common royal ancient Greek name. It means \"she who has a glorious father\" (\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2=glory). She was the 7th Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt but the name had traveled there from Macedonia with the ruling class.There were several Cleopatras among the ruling class of Macedonia going back to Cleopatra Euridice, the \"trophy wife\" (?) that Philip married and made Olympias and Alexander furious. Another Cleopatra was Philip's daughter and Alexander's sister at whose wedding Philip was murdered.  Cleopatra was the product of incest to the point that she had only two great-great-grandparents instead of the expected 16.  Almost all her ancestors belonged to Greek aristocracy therefore she definitely was no exotic beauty. Look at this portrait.  ",
