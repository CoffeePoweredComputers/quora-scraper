            "answer_text": "Louisiana usually ranks in the low 40s in all manner of economic well being. Why? My guesses at \u201croot causes\u201d: \u2014Lack of education. The state has the fifth lowest high school graduation rate, and the fifth lowest rate for people with a bachelors degree. Business today \u2014 even a warehouse operation like Amazon or a car manufacturing plant \u2014 needs educated workers who can be easily trained on equipment. Louisiana just does not produce them. Perhaps it is underfunding the schools, or a culture that just does not value education (see below for some possible reasons for that). There are certainly no top flight universities. Sorry LSU alums, but LSU is not UCLA or Michigan, or even UT. \u2014No major cities. New Orleans used to be one of the country\u2019s largest most vibrant cities, up there with Boston, New York and Philadelphia \u2014 in the early to mid-18th century. It was number three in population in 1850. Now, at 1.5 million people, it is the 36th largest Combined Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA), the broadest guage of an unrbanized region\u2019s population. Smaller than Jacksonville, FL, and Greensboro, NC. Big things happen in cities. Inventions. Innovations. New ways of doing business. Cities are great way to pool talent, a potent catalyst for creativity, and enrich the surrounding region. Just look at what Atlanta has done for Georgia. \u2014A vague sense of fatalism. I grew up there. And I always sensed a certain, hard to describe passivity among folks, even the business people my dad worked with. \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d \u201cAll we can do is pray.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just see how it plays out \u2014 not much we can do.\u201d Maybe it came from the state\u2019s history of slavery. Perhaps the religiosity of the people. Or being subject to the whims of outsiders: Washington politicians controlling grants and public works projects or CEOs in distant cities (Louisiana has few Fortune 500s HQ\u2019d there) deciding what investments will and will not be made there. Maybe it is a reaction to natural disasters: floods and hurricanes. There is little sense of agency or urgency. \u2014A reluctance to defer gratification. People like to party there, especially in the dominant southern part of the state. Good food. Company, Drink. Laissez les bons temps rouler. There is not the deep strain of Calvinism you still, to this day, see in, say New England or the Northern European work ethic, austerity, of, say, the upper Midwest. Work and save first. Then spend and enjoy. Judiciously. I saw this in state government where the inclination was to postpone hard decisions and simply use accounting tricks (2000s) or borrowing (1980s). The lack of a soverign wealth fund where the oil money could be saved and invested, like those in Norway, the UAE, or Qatar, is especially telling. Or in something as simple as environmental regulation. \u201cSure let\u2019s waive those restrictions on that chemical plant. We can always deal with the outcomes later.\u201d (Like 30 years later when folks are coming down with cancers). \u2014An extraction economy. Louisiana is blessed and cursed with ample natural resources. For a century or more all folks had to do was drill a hole in the ground, and voila, a revenue stream. It was like Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. The good news: quick riches or at least affluence if you were anywhere near the petroleum industry (think of all the service businesses it supports). The bad news: too many people got used to making money without really hard work, industry and creativity. Why go to graduate school \u2014 MIT or Cal Tech, say \u2014 and spend the energy and time to invent some micro-processor or write software when you can sit back and rake in royalty checks. And economic mistakes made by government? They can be papered over with yet more oil revenue. Or borrowing. It works till it doesn\u2019t. The 80s proved that, as did the recent soft period in energy prices. *** Yes, there are all sorts of intermediate causes. High taxes. Bloated government. Corruption. Racism. But think about these five and the contributions they have made to the current mess. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no doubt Louisiana is poor. We rank 49th. Only Mississippi and Washington D.C. have a larger percentage of their population below the poverty line. It should be noted, however, that 14 state have more households below the poverty line than Louisiana. Some of these, like California, New York, or Texas are understandable because they have such a larger population. But others, such as Tennessee and Alabama, which are about the same size as Louisiana, have more households below the poverty line as well. I only bring this up to emphasize poverty is not a problem exclusive in any way to Louisiana. There are a variety of factors at play. Although Louisiana has a fairly low unemployment rate, there is a pretty high gender gap \u2014 men make a lot more than women. The gap is larger in Louisiana than any other state. When half your population is making lower wages than comparable jobs for the other half, it's going to impact the bottom line. A lot of Louisiana is rural, similar to Mississippi, which is a huge factor. We had inept economic leadership. The former Governor Bobby Jindal was given a $1 billion surplus when he took office and turned it into a $1.6 billion deficit before he left. He cut budgets for schools in the process. When you cut financial support for education, you also contribute to lower wages since more of your population is less educated than people in other states. Louisiana relies heavily on the Hospitality industry, particularly in New Orleans. People who work in hotels and restaurants are among the lowest paid, so this also contributes. Finally, there are a few other factors that on paper put Louisiana further down on the poverty list than it probably should be. Everything I said above is true, and contributes \u2014 so by any measure, Louisiana is a \"poor\" state. But if there were a way account for these other factors that lower the cost of living (due to the way property taxes are structured, and a lot of non-delcared income in the hospitality industry), Louisiana would probably be up around 35 or 40 on the list (still poor, just not as poor). In other words, yes, Louisiana is poor. No, there isn't any one reason. But they also are not as poor as the statistics would lead one to believe. ",
