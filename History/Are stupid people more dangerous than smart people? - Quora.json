            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Intelligent people become dangerous for 3 reasons: Experimenting, in order to discover and invent something new that can advance science and push things forward.Making big, bold plans for the future,in order to achieve something bigger.Suffering from mental illness.The first 2 are actually good, and what progresses humanity. The 3rd one they can't control, and haven't found how to cure. Stupid people are dangerous because: They can't progress science.They are inefficient. They waste time and resources to return little back, if not more problems.They make too many mistakes, out of incapability, while trying to achieve something less, like use an existing system that is already made to help them.They depend on more intelligent people to solve all their big problems and prepare a \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cfair\u201d environment for them.Stupid people are basically time-wasting, resource-wasting, self-pleasing dependents that offer little back even when they try their best. It is believed that intelligence is the gift of God to man. And without the more intelligent people, humans could lose the evolution race. That is the biggest danger possible for the whole of mankind.

If someone\u2019s aggressive and stupid, then they will probably be quite straightforward in their aggression. They may try to hurt you physically, rob you, bully you, scare you, destroy your property, et cetera. If they are smart, however, they may be more cunning in their aggression (narcissistic, sociopathic, psychopathic types). They may use their social pull and power to turn people against you, manipulate you and others, get you fired, destroy your career and family, poison you, take away your children, and so on. A lot of these types get into positions of power (policemen, politicians, doctors, psychologists, and so on.), which makes them more dangerous because they have power over others who are often in some ways dependent on them. It\u2019s much easier to protect yourself from some angry, straightforward person. ",

From my own experience, I have seen many times that people unhindered and unburdened by intelligence are far more likely to not hesitate to strike first, and decisively, in a toe to toe confrontation. In a combat situation, you had better believe that he who overthinks is more likely to die with the same expression on his face that he had as he paused, to think about the situation\u2026 than the guy who doesn\u2019t think. As hard as it may be to believe, there are situations, of which this is only one, where your intelligence can be more of a liability than an asset. ",

Now you tell me are you more or less worried about the future today then for example five years ago . Donald Trump is a stupid man. Only people with no fear work for him . This is because they are stupid too. In fact the only man who is in control in the USA is the Defence Secretary James N. Mattis and this is because he knows full well the President is clueless and he can ignore illegal orders. So here is your ultimate example Trump is so dangerous an astute former general feels he needs to have control over the US military. ",
