            "answer_text": "There are no \u201cwhite Jews\u201d. Not unless you count recent converts. And even if you do, we\u2019re talking less than 3,000 people here (hell, probably less than ONE thousand). And I am only pointing this out because \u201cwhite Jew\u201d is all too often used as a shorthand for \u201cAshkenazi\u201d. And this is just wrong, not to mention quite dangerous. Ashkenazi Jews are not white. They are Middle Eastern. Exile to Europe did not change their race. Oded Fehr is an Ashkenazi Jew whose parents made aliyah from Germany/Holland. He is obviously not white.  Jeff Goldblum is an Ashkenazi Jew from the United States. Does he look white?  Ben Schwartz is an Ashkenazi Jew. Obviously not white.  Jazz Jennings is also an Ashkenazi Jew. She\u2019s clearly not white.  Of course, there are Ashkenazim who look white, but most who do are products of recent intermarriage (i.e. half-Ashkenazi/half-white, like Scarlett Johanssen). There are also plenty of non-Jewish Levantines who look white. Google Syrians, Lebanese Maronites, Druze, Samaritans, etc and you\u2019ll see what I mean. But I digress. Here\u2019s what our racial breakdown looks like\u2026 Ashkenazi Jews - Middle Eastern. Sephardi Jews - Middle Eastern. Mizrahi Jews - Middle Eastern. North American Jews - Mainly of Ashkenazi descent, but not entirely. Furthermore, most American Jews are products of intermarriage (e.g. they have an Ashkenazi mother and a white-English father, or something like that). South American Jews - Mostly of Ashkenazi and/or Sephardi descent. Australian Jews - Mostly Ashkenazi. 99% of the world\u2019s Jews fall into one or more of those subgroups, all of whom are Middle Eastern. As for the others\u2026 Beta Israel - Black. Bene Israel - South Asian/Middle Eastern. Kaifeng Jews - East Asian. Converts - Can be white, or of any race. But it must be emphasized that 99% of the world\u2019s Jews are NOT converts. The above four groups collectively number about 200\u2013300 thousand. That\u2019s 200\u2013300 thousand out of at least 12\u201315 million Jews. Now for the main question: we were never a race, although I suppose it depends on how one defines \u201crace\u201d. We are certainly as much of a \u201crace\u201d as Arabs, Persians, Latinos, and Native Americans are. But we\u2019re not a \u201crace\u201d in the sense that Africans, East Asians, and white people are races. We\u2019re an ethnoreligious tribal group (Tribes of Judah and Levi with Benjamin and Simeon mixed in) and nation. And like most nations, the vast majority of us belong to a single ethnicity, indigenous to a specific place (in our case, Judea/Israel). Hope that clarifies things. And I hope that was easy to understand. It\u2019s pretty late where I am, so forgive any grammatical mistakes. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cJew\u201d is not \u201ca race\u201d but\u2026 Jews are \u201cethnoreligious group\u201d or more correctly - set of several such groups\u2026 Ethnoreligious group is defined in Wikipedia as \u201can ethnic group whose members are also unified by a common religious background\u201d. Contemporary Judaism in almost all its versions is non-proselytizing so while people of all \u201craces\u201d (not that human \u201craces\u201d is valid biological concept anyway\u2026) can become Jews, vast majority are having common ethnic background. There\u2019re ~15 -16 million Jews in the world. Over 6 million of them are living in Israel. So when non-Israeli meets someone Jewish it\u2019s almost certainly someone of very specific ethnic background as of the ~9 millions living outside Israel over ~7 million are specifically Ashkenazi Jews. Also Sephardi Jews which are second largest group outside Israel are having clear ties and similarity to Ashkenazi Jews. So Jews is not only religion but also ethnicity. Moreover in many cases Jews are more ethnicity than religion. Or even almost exclusively ethnicity with little relation to religion. As many people would remind - Nazis were killing all those \u201cethnically Jewish\u201d even if converted to Christianity for several generations. I can bring another example. In Soviet Union and socialist countries of Eastern Europe anti-Semitism had precisely nothing to do with a faith, it was totally ethnic/ quasi-racist. ",
