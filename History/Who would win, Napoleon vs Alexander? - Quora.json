            "answer_text": "Alexander would win if the battle was at the end of Napoleon\u2019s reign. Why? Hubris. By the time Napoleon was at the end of his career he was so steeped in his own narcissistic image of himself and was so arrogant and sure he \u201cknew it all\u201d that he failed to see the obvious \u2014 that he could not win the Russian Campaign of 1812. While both men were genius\u2019 in their own right and time, Napoleon failed not because he was not a great military leader. He was. He failed because he thought himself more than he was. [1] https://www.jstor.org/stable/4165613?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Hubris was the cause of Napoleon\u2019s downfall, just as it causes the careers of political and business leaders today to implode. Experts and studies show the NUMBER ONE cause of business and military failures is hubris - believing and acting like you know it all. Hitler was defeated because of his own hubris, as was Napoleon. As incredible as these men and others like them are/were, they could not fend off the \u201cbig four\u201d sources of failure: Narcissism - the pursuit of gratification from vanity or egotistic admiration of one's idealized self-image and attributes.A string of success that feeds the narcissism - Because he was a brilliant military strategist, Napoleon had a long string of successes, many of them after others swore he\u2019d fail. That only added to the intensity of his narcissism.Blindly believing your own press - or what others say about you or tell you. One of the reasons leaders like Napoleon fail is (1) they don\u2019t listen to the advice and counsel of wiser, leveler heads, and (2) no one dare tell them what they know they don\u2019t want to hear. They end up insulated in their own silo of arrogance, and narcissism, and hubris.A history of getting away with breaking the rules, believing and acting like rules are for everyone else, but not for you. Every world leader today or in the past who has acted as though the rules didn\u2019t apply to them, found out quickly, and painfully (Thanks to Nemesis) that yes, the rules DO apply to everyone.The Army\u2019s War College [ United States Army War College - Wikipedia] is about more than military tactics. It\u2019s about the mental or headspace of military leaders, personality, and other non-traditional tactics as well as the rules of war. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called \u201c The Art of War.\u201d The Art of War, and it is an art, is about more than the rules of combat. It\u2019s about ignoring the rules of war and focusing on the weakness of one\u2019s enemy rather than the strength of one\u2019s army. Sun Tzu\u2019s Art of War: How Ancient Strategy Can Lead to Modern Success Denial: Why Business Leaders Fail to Look Facts in the Face\u2014and What to Do About It by Richard S Tedlow: \u201cI have been teaching and writing about business history for four decades, and what is striking about the dozens of companies and CEOs I have studied is the large number of them who have made mistakes that could and should have been avoided, not just with the benefit of hindsight, but on the basis of information available to decision-makers right then and there, in real-time. These mistakes resulted from individuals denying reality.\u201d ~ Richard S Tedlow. When you understand that war, or battle, whether it\u2019s a military campaign, or trying to beat out a co-worker for a promotion, is not about power, but personality and mental tactics (politics), then you can consistently win \u2014 as long as you can avoid hubris. Once hubris enters the picture the only way to equalize the field is through Nemesis. And that\u2019s a cruel and devastating way to go down. Rest assured, you WILL go down. Hitler did. Napoleon did, and dozens of Fortune 500 CEOs have as well. ",

            "answer_text": "If they both have their finest formations at strength, Napoleon wins. It\u2019s not even a contest. Alexander had about 30\u201340 thousand men. Suppose we round this up to 50,000. Napoleon easily has three times as many. Plus of course Napoleon has these:  Artillery guard of Napoleon. Alexander\u2019s hand is forced, he has to attack or die an agonizing death by artillery Yes, yes, I know \u201cmilitary technology doesn\u2019t decide wars, it\u2019s just a force multiplier\u201d. The reason for that meme is that neighboring states never fall far behind in military technology. A development by one side is countered by a development in the other, either by innovation, capture, espionage or some other means. There were very few wars fought with a major disconnect in military technology - Anglo-Zulu war and the Opium wars might qualify (as a very deep maybe, Zulus had guns and British could only use light infantry), as would Spanish conquests of the Americas and a few other conflicts like these. Furthermore, greater force is certaily relevant to the outcome of any war. Military technology with over 2000 years of technological advancement is absolutely relevant to the consideration and Napoleonic formations would do a number on Alexandrian army. Macedonian phalangites are uniquely poorly suited against the musket lines of the French, who just shoot them to pieces from close range. Not even the Asthetairoi (the elite amongst phalangites) would fight for long if their front 4\u20135 rows fell down to musket fire. Companion cavalry faces men who know how to face down a cavalry charge and survive.  Infantry square Furthermore, these infantry can also hit back at cavalry beyond the range of their musket-spears. Alexadner the Great has very few counters to the French formation: a charge by war elephants (he didn\u2019t use them, but might get a hold of a few nonetheless), if it caught the French by surprise, might do some damage and his archers and slingers might be able to outshoot the French muskets. Not the field guns, but they can have some effect. Then again..  They also carry pistols that would effectively counter elephants If they both have similar technology and are able to use it well, either Alexander has an is skilled in use of a Napoleonic-era army, or else Napoleon has an Alexander-era arm and is skilled in use, then Alexander wins. It\u2019s not even a contest, Napoleon wasn\u2019t that great a general to begin with. He was a competent artillery officer, brilliant propagandist and knew who should he entrust his military leadership to (Louis-Alexandre Berthier) so he could then take credit for the many victories that would be won in his name.
