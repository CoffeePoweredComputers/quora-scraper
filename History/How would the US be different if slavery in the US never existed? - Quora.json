            "answer_text": "I assume your focus is solely on the African transatlantic slave trade and not concerned with indentured servitude of Europeans, enslavement of Native People or semi-slave conditions of the Chinese on the West Coast. There are a few different ways to think about this. I'm not sure which is the \"right\" way. 1) Purely economic.  Find out the cumulative GDP of the US in from 1650 to 1865 and subtract from that the cumulative value of slave output between 1650 and 1865.  The problem is, GDP data only goes back to 1790.  You could think of the price paid for the slave as a proxy for expected output. This article discusses a lot, but it doesn't really provide the answer Measuring the Value of a Slave 2)  another approach is to look for a 'natural experiment'.  Is there a  country roughly the same size, demographics, etc...as the that didn't  have the transatlantic slave trade?   Australia could be a proxy.  Large  land mass, English-Protestant settlers etc...  It seems to have done ok  without the practice, so maybe the US would be like Australia?  Would the US be a utopia where all the races got along and there was no discrimination?  Well, again, looking at Australia which had a whites-only immigration policy until the 1970s and continues to have pockets of racism against various non-whites, I'm not sure if you can come to that conclusion.  One could strongly argue that enslavement of people caused a multitude of cultural and emotional scars still felt today.  As recently as 1965, it would have been illegal for Barack Obama's parents to be wed in 30 of 50 US states!  This and other practices (redlining, housing covenants, farm land seizures, etc...) where directly tied to discriminatory laws based on blacks being unequal to whites. At the time the US constitution was written, enslaved Africans were not even considered human. 3)  another approach is to consider this in the greater global context.  In 1803,  France sold the Louisiana Territories to the US at a pittance after  losing a guerrilla war in Haiti following a slave uprising.  Without  this, would the continental US still be divided between France, Spain  and the now USA? 4) the last approach is to  think about culture.  Enslaved Africans brought new foods, words and  music with them to America.  These were used to create a new culture in  the New World.  They've had a lasting impact on popular music, literature, dance and the arts.  Would the US have jazz, R&B, hip hop, salsa, rock and roll  and even country music without these influences?  What about all the associated dances with swing, salsa, etc...? Now imagine the US without rock and roll or any of the music you listen to today.  That's one way of answering your question. It's a nice thought experiment, but it's almost an impossible question to answer. ",
