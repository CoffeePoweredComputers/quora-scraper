            "answer_text": "A proper answer depends on your definition of lost wonders but I am going to assume that you mean the lost Wonders of the Ancient World. The list was not definitive at the time and only really formalized during the Renaissance. There were originally seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The only one that remains intact today is also the oldest, the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza, Egypt, built c. 2580\u20132560 BCE. The Hanging Gardens. Built around 600 BCE, legend suggests they were in the city of Babylon, modern Iraq. However, no evidence of them has ever been found in Babylon. Some believe that the Gardens never existed. The theory I believe is the one suggested by Stephanie Dalley: that the Gardens were in fact a well-documented monument in Nineveh, further to the north. Its ultimate fate remains unknown.The Statue of Zeus at Olympia, Greece. As tall as a four story building, the Statue was built in 435 BCE. It was housed in the Temple of Zeus and was sculpted by Phidias, who also sculpted the Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon. It was later moved to Constantinople and there was destroyed by fire.The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, modern Turkey. 14 stories high, this splendid tomb was adorned with twice-life-size statues for which it was most well known. From the 12th to 15th centuries CE, the Mausoleum was struck down by a series of earthquakes. Some of its remains can still be seen on site today.The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, modern Turkey. Built and rebuilt three times, it was the final incarnation in 323 BCE that would become the wonder. With 127 columns, it would have seemed like a forest when walking among them. In 268 CE, the Temple was destroyed or at least damaged by a Gothic raid. Some of the columns continue on, however, having been incorporated into the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople.The Colossus of Rhodes, Greece. A 33 meter (108 feet) high bronze statue of the Greek god Helios, it was constructed in 280 BCE. It did not last long. In 226 BCE, an earthquake toppled the Colossus, snapping it at the knees. Never rebuilt, the remains lay where they fell and still remained an impressive sight until 653 CE, when Arabs took Rhodes and sold the remains to be melted down.Finally, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt. Completed in 247 BCE, 120 to 137 meters high (sources vary), it stood tall until a series of earthquakes (956 to 1323 CE) damaged it beyond repair and the site was finally cleared for building material in 1480 CE. However, some remains have been found at the bottom of the habour and there are plans to incorporate them into some kind of underwater museum.",
