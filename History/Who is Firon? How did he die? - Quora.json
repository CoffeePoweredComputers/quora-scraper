            "answer_text": "NOTE: I am using the Islamic argument because the word Fir\u2019awn was used in the question, a word specifically used in the Qur\u2019an. If you would like an alternative answer that is not founded in religion, please leave a comment and I\u2019ll get back to you. Fir'awn is the Arabic for Pharoah, as used in the Qur\u2019an several times in the narration of the story of Musa (Moses) peace be upon him. Historians have attributed the Pharaoah at the time of Moses to be many people - Merneptah particularly, given that there is the Merneptah Stele which is the only Ancient Egyptian document to mention the Israelites. However, other pharaohs who have been suggested include Ramesses the Great (Ramesses II) because of how the Qur\u2019an states Fir\u2019awn died (I\u2019m using the Yusuf Ali translation): \"This day shall We save thee in the body, that thou mayest be a sign to those who come after thee! but verily, many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs!\" (Qur\u2019an 10:92) Ramesses II has been extremely well-preserved:  And as a result of this, many people believe Fir\u2019awn to be him. However, this is speculation - we do not have any concrete evidence to prove the identity of Fir\u2019awn. Personally, if God wanted us to know he would have given us a name, and there\u2019s another verse in the Qur\u2019an that might be worth considering (yes, some may say it\u2019s not relevant because it\u2019s in relation to another affair but what it\u2019s saying is don\u2019t speculate): (Some) say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; (others) say they were five, the dog being the sixth,- doubtfully guessing at the unknown; (yet others) say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. Say thou: \"My Lord knoweth best their number; It is but few that know their (real case).\" Enter not, therefore, into controversies concerning them, except on a matter that is clear, nor consult any of them about (the affair of) the Sleepers. (Qur\u2019an 18:22). Hope that helps! ",

And [recall] when We parted the sea for you (Moses) and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.

Al-Qur'aan 28:40]  And  We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his  soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until, when drowning  overtook him, he said, \"I believe that there is no deity except that in  whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims.\"Now? And you had disobeyed [Him] before and were of the corrupters?So  today We will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you  a sign. And indeed, many among the people, of Our signs, are heedless.Al-Qur'aan 10:90-92 Imaam Ibn Kathir's exgesis.The waves took them up and down. The waves accumalated above Fhirauwnand he was overwhelmed by the stupors of death. While in this state he said, \"I believe that there is no deity except that in  whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims.\" Note: Fhirauwn was speaking inside the sea waves for which the present day scientists would discard it because it is impossible.
