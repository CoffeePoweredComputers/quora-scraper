            "answer_text": "With all due respect to other answerers, and as someone who did a good part of my studies in Egypt, the question above indicates the general ignorance in the building of the Pyramids by the phrase \u201cby today\u2019s standards\u201d. First of all, all school textbooks, from Kindergarten to University, clearly indicate the use of slaves and how the Pyramids were built. Further to that, the hyeroglyphs in the various areas in Egypt, as well as in Cairo\u2019s Museum, demonstrate clearly how hundreds of slaves are being whipped and pushing stones in place to build the Pyramid. As I have described in other replies on this subject, slaves were available by the thousands. The big difficulty in understanding this is that people think how this would be done in today\u2019s world; meaning, working by day from a certain hour, getting a break, having a lunch-time, leaving and going home in the evening. Add to that, weekends and vacations. Unfortunately, in those days, there was no such thing. Slaves were made to work with a whip all day long. If they tripped, broke a limb or had a heart-attack, they were simply pushed aside and were replaced from a \u201cstock\u201d of thousands of other slaves. The reason behind that is that the Pharaoh knew his death could happen at any time. Simple health difficulties of today, such as a flu, a cough or a diarrhea, were major in those days because home remedies were not that effective and people could die from them. If the Pharaoh wanted something built, hundreds of slaves were put to the task immediately without any delay. The Pyramids took approximately 2 decades to be built [20 years]. That is 20 years of 24-hours per day labor. There was only a \u201cHead Architect\u201d appointed by Pharaoh and he had his aides who followed his every word. Contrary to what some have said, there were no skilled workers, just slaves. The work simply consisted of pushing huge rectangular rocks on tree trunks, as casters, from the boats that brought them from Southern Egypt to where they were placed. The first row was square shaped. For the second row, a ramp was built and the rectangular rocks were pushed up this ramp and so on, and so on. Animals were rarely used because there were not that many in North Africa and they were mostly kept as food for special celebrations. When the Pyramid was finished, that \u201cugly pile of rocks\u201d was covered with limestone for a nice finish. Unfortunately, the limestone only lasted a few years. The Pyramids have lasted thousands of years and will last a long time because they are all \u201ca pile of solid rocks\u201d. They are not made of brick and mortar where the mortar disintegrates and the bricks fall down. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: The great pyramids in Egypt seem like a near impossible undertaking even by today\u2019s standards. How were they able to build them so quickly and to last thousands of years? I don\u2019t know whether \u2018so quickly\u2019 is the case! The great pyramid at Giza took some 20,000 men around 20 years to complete, however, and contrary to popular opinion, they were not slave workers. The vast majority were agricultural workers who had pyramid building as a second job during those times of the year when the Nile flooded and they were unable to work in the fields. They were well organised and well looked after - a considerable number of records exist which confirm this. As to how they last for thousands of years, again using the great pyramid at Giza as an example, it was built of approximately 2.3 million blocks of granite, weighing up to 8 tonnes each. Although there are some chambers and passages inside, it\u2019s mainly solid stone constructed in the most stable shape there is. ",
