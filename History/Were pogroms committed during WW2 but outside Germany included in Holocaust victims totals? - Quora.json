            "answer_text": "The \u201cvictim totals\u201d are only estimates, but with that qualification, the answer is yes. The Holocaust began in 1941 with systematic killing of Jews in Russia by the einsatzgruppen. At the very beginning of that effort, which was not that organized yet, the einsatzgruppen would prompt locals to launch pogroms against local Jews, resulting in killings. But this lasted only a short while in 1941. Rather than waste time on pogroms, locals were recruited as auxilaries to assist in the systematic killings of all Jews. In places such as the Ukraine or Lithuania, the locals did an awful lot of the killing under the supervision of einsatzgruppen officers, rather than the Germans doing it. I would not call these mass killings \u201cpogroms,\u201d although there were some at the start before the mass killings became the norm. The most well known mass killing of this nature was outside Kiev at Babi Yar. Ukranian collaborators assisted. ",

            "answer_text": "A pogram is a riot. I don\u2019t know that there were canonical pograms. However, most of the Jews killed by the Nazis during WWII lived outside Germany. Locals would point out the Jews to the Nazi officials. That is how many Jews were identified and marked for murder. This couldn\u2019t be caused a pogram. Three were also locals who were paid, or just invited, to kill the Jews at the massacres. Again, this wasn\u2019t properly a pogram. That is a strange way to ask a question. Why are you specifying \u2018pograms\u2019? There is a connection between pograms and the betrayals that I just mentioned. However, they weren\u2019t the same thing. There were awful pograms during the reign of Czar Nicholas II. Most of these pograms came after the publications of \u2018Protocols of the Elders of Zion\u2019 in one of the state tabloids. Certainly, Hitler considered Protocols to be literally true, every word. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, because millions will killed in Poland and Russia, plus hundreds of thousands in many other German-occupied countries. One of the things often overlooked is that the Holocaust included the extermination not only of six million Jews, but also hundreds of thousands of Roma people, and many millions of non-Jewish Poles, Russians, and other European nationalities in mass shootings and extermination camps. Others were worked to death as slave laborers. ",
