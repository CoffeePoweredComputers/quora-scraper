We actually looked into buying one. It was between a residential trailer park (gypsy site?) and an industrial estate. It had two designated parking spots, and just one wing was habitable. There was an enclosed paved Courtyard. It had a small amount of surrounding land - basically just wooded slopes, no usable land, not even enough for a vegetable garden. There were no outbuildings that could be used for storage of bikes and canoes. Nice idea, but just not practicable. Every one is a King in his own house. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: If I buy a castle from Scotland, can I declare myself a king? I take it you mean a castle in Scotland. If you want to yes, but it would have no legal authority and no-one would take any notice of you, other than perhaps to think you were a bit of a self-obsessed idiot! Of course, if you were to form a new nation in an open ocean location - outside any territorial waters and exclusive economic zones - which met with the framework as laid down in the United Nations Charter of the Law of the Sea, you could declare yourself to be whatsoever you wanted, and as long as your citizens were happy with that, fine. But the issues are formidable, and whilst it\u2019s possible, no-one has managed to do this yet, despite several attempts. ",
