            "answer_text": "There are many factors to civil unrest. It could be bad leaders, and decentralization in government. In context to the Byzantine Empire, semi-decentralization was common; Strategoi, or military governors, usually acted semi-autonomously in their own province. This half feudal, half centralized organization led to civil unrest and revolts. Another important factor in Byzantine life were the demes. The demes were basically, chariot teams, and Romans (if we could call them that) at that time pledged themself to their own team; even the emperor was involved with the demes. Another possible factor was how the military was structured. Let me take Justin I for example. Justin I was born a pheasant and swineherd, and soon joined the military. He joined the Excubitors, who were a palace guard paramilitary. Because of his ability, he was able to become a senator, tribune, and commander of the palace guard. Once the Emperor died, he had no children to continue his dynasty. Justin used his position as commander of the palace guard, bribed the senate, and they in turn proclaimed him Emperor Justin I. All in all, the most common factor for revolt was unhappiness in government standing. When the government was weak or unstable, people of individual provinces found that was the time to revolt. All these factors I have just listed could be reasons for revolts in the Byzantine Empire. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it lasted over 1000 years without any law or tradition of succession or primogeniture. They continued to maintain that the Senate elected the consul. What this means in practice was that the strongest or most politically astute became Emperor. There was some legitimacy in being related to a previous emperor, but that was just one factor and usually was outweighed by control of the army. ",
