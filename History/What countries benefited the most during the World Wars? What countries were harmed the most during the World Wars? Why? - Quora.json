            "answer_text": "The USA benefited greatly from both wars.  Even before the US joined the war they were making weapons for the combatants. In the first World war although the US joined very late into the war the US showed the world it could raise a military in a very short amount of time and ship them across the ocean. The German Empire knew that the fresh troops and vast amount of material that the US would provide would greatly tip the scales in favor of the Triple Entente. This is why the Germans launched the Spring Offensive to try and overwhelm the depleted French and Commonwealth forces before the bulk of US material and manpower arrived in Europe.  As you know the offensive failed and greatly resulted in Germany\u2019s defeat. The US then launched into the Roaring 20s where the US economy sky rocketed due to most of Europe depending on US products to stay afloat like food and materials. Later when Europe could sustain themselves the US faced economic troubles which resulted in the Great Depression (of course it\u2019s a little more complicated then that but back to the question). Now we get to the second world war which really turned the US into a super power. Like the first world war the US yet again joined a little late after the Japanese attacked Pearl harbor on December 7, 1941. Yet again the US raised a massive military in a relatively short time due to their massive industrial base and natural resources.  To shorten the answer we\u2019ll skip to the end of the war where the 3rd Reich and Japan lay in ruin. The US had many advantages after the war ended with the only country who could rival them being the USSR. United States of America shortly after World War 2 Only nuclear powerBiggest Navy in the worldBiggest Air forceMassive economic prosperityOne of the only countries not destroyed after WW2Lost only 400,000 people (when looking at other countries this is not a lot we lost more in the American civil war)As you can see the US was just a monster after the war and made it into the super power we know today. There has not been a single large scale war between super powers since then and most countries are enjoying economic prosperity. I hope you enjoy this answer it was refreshing to write I hope this helps you. Thanks for reading! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s easier to say who lost less - that would be the US. They lost less people, and gained intellectual and financial power compared to the rest of the world. But that\u2019s not really benefitting\u2026 In essence humanity suffered greatly by both wars. The combined human loss of life goes toward 70 million people, or more. This is the equivalent of wiping out a whole country somewhere between the size of France and Germany. Imagine how many things were not invented, developed, or produced as a result. On the other hand the war forced technical innovation and commerce into overdrive, which brought about the roaring twenties and the post WWII boom years. How do you equate a net benefit, ot loss from something like that? The best way to even try is to look at purchase parity balanced GDP. When you do this you see a clear decline all over the world in the years immediately after both wars (especially WWII). Since economic growth compounds (it\u2019s growth on growth) you never recuperate from a decrease like that.  Thus you can conclude that both World Wars, but especially WWII didn't benefit anyone. For some groups it was especially catastrophic - the Soviet Union lost twenty million, or more of its poulation. People of Jewish faith in Europe were almost extinguished. Urban and industrial areas in Germany and Japan were completely obliterated by carpet bombing. It\u2019s impossible to quantify this enormous loss in terms of economy and development. Moreover it impacts the whole world as this means that the nations less affected might look like they benefit, but in reality they lose as the global market opportunities go down. Some have made the argument that the US benefited greatly form the wars so that the 20th century became the \u2018American Century\u2019 - this is, however not a tenable argument for two reasons: we cannot be certain that the \u2018American Century\u2019 was only an effect of the wars, it could have happened anyway - we will never know.this is a zero sum argument assuming that there has to be losers and winners in economy. This is not so, we might very well have seen fantastic development all over the world without the wars - again we will never know.So it becomes an argument of who lost less - in this case it looks like the US comes out ahead.
