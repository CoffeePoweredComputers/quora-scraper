            "answer_text": "Japan had many war commitments. It was involved in a confrontation with the United States after the bombing of the Pearl Harbor base, but in addition, in its expansionist drive, it maintained fronts in Southeast Asia and China. With all this activity it was materially impossible for Japan to participate in an invasion of the eastern part of the USSR, specifically through Vladivostok. Just as Stalin was asking Churchill to open a front against the Germans in southern France to reduce Nazi pressure on Soviet cities, Hitler knew that the Japanese had a plan against the Soviet Union (I don't remember the name of the plan) and pressed for its execution to facilitate the capture of USSR cities in Operation Barbarossa. For a long time the Japanese did not deny the existence of the plan but they needed time to ponder whether or not they could execute it. Finally they discarded it. It is easy to imagine that if Japan accepted Hitler's request to invade the USSR from the east of Russia's SSR, the war for Japan would have come to an end two to three years early. ",

            "answer_text": "They thought (rightly so) that it was worthier to spend their time and resources in the Pacific Ocean, rather than in a region which lacked any kind of significance, aside from the political one. Besides, to attack Soviet Union meant to involve in an unwelcoming warfare, played not by aircrafts or warships, but by the infantry. Japan knew in advance how costly those campaigns could be (since the early 1930s, they were fighting a brutal war in China, that was causing millions of casualties), so they just assumed that the cost-benefit of invading the URSS was simply not good enough to move the pieces.
