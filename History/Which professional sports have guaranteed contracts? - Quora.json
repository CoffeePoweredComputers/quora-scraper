            "answer_text": "Among the \"Big Four\", only the NFL does not have a concept of a Guaranteed Contract (as defined as \"The player will get the full value of this contract, even if we cut you\"). In the NFL, most contracts are not guaranteed at all, and are basically week to week deals (the annual salary is divided by 17, and the player gets paid that every game week they are on the roster...if he gets cut midseason, he stops getting paid) other than in a few special cases: 1.  Any \"vested\" player (player with more than 4 years experience) who is on a team's opening day roster is guaranteed the full annual salary for the year, even if cut.  This does not apply to players cut during training camp and then signed midseason, only players that make the team out of camp 2.  Players can negotiate that their contracts be guaranteed against injury (if a player gets injured, then cut as a result of that injury, they still get paid.  If this clause isn't there, then the team can cut them and only have to pay an \"injury settlement\" which is almost always significantly lower than the salary. In the other Big Four sports (Hockey, Basketball, Baseball), a contract is guaranteed, regardless of player performance.  the only exception is if a player gets cut for cause (violation of team or league rules, not keeping in shape, etc). NFL players do, however, get \"signing bonuses\" which are guaranteed money, as they are \"earned\" upon signing the contract.  These bonuses aren't always paid out in full immediately, but they are the player's property, and the team must pay out except in very narrow circumstances (player violated team or league rules, primarily).

            "answer_text": "Out of the 4 major sports all of them have some level of guaranteed contracts although Baseball and Basketball are closer to what I would call a real contract. Football there are a few, but not many which is why they go for the huge signing bonuses as those signing bonuses are guaranteed money and usually paid up front. ",
