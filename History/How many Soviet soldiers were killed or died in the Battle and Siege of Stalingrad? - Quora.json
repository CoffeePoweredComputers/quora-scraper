            "answer_text": "The exact number is around 1.9 million. But that\u2019s just another large number in the face of one of the largest battles of the largest war in history. The number 1,900,000 is meaningless to me as it does not tell how bad the conditions were. To put that in perspective, a soldier stationed there had an average life expectancy of 24 hours upon reaching the battlefield. Even with that, it is difficult to see the number as what it really is. The fact is that more soldiers lost their lives at Stalingrad than the total lives lost by the Americans, French and the British put together. Even then it is very difficult to put such a large number of human lives lost, in perspective. Overall, Stalingrad was a grinder, where the German and the Russian commanders blindly sent their troops into, while valuing their soldiers as just mere commodities instead of what they actually were, human lives.
