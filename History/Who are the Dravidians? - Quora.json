            "answer_text": "The Dravidian peoples, or Dravidian speaking people, are the modern people speaking Dravidian languages and can trace (at least partially) ancestry to the ancient proto-Dravidians, which originated somewhere in West Asia 10.000 years ago. They form the most importand ancestry component of South Asians and played a importand role in the formation of the South Asian culture. Generally, they are linked to early farmers and gatherers from the Zagros mountain area which form the main ancestry component of modern South Asians. Some suggest that West-Eurasian ancestry was alredy present in South Asia more than 40,000 years ago. (More about that later.)    Proto-Dravidians are generally linked to the ancient \u201cneolithic Zagros agriculturalists and gatherers\u201d from modern day Iran (but not identical to modern Iranians, although modern Iranians still have some Zagros farmer ancestry as well), which migrated and conquered/displaced most of the outnumbered native hunter gatherers of South Asia about 8,000 years ago.  There is much genetic, linguistic and archeological evidence for that. Many recent studies have pointed out the West Asian origin for proto-Dravidians. The proto-Dravidian language originated from a neolithic population in the Zagros mountain area in modern day Iran. These Proto-Dravidians were a Caucasoid (or West-Eurasian) population and possibly closely related to the Elamites of Iran and Iraq. Modern distribution of West-Eurasian related (Caucasoid) ancestry:   The ancient Dravidians are also suggested to have created the Indus Valley culture. DNA analyses show that the majority of ancient Indus Valley samples have in average 80% to 98% Iranian farmer-related DNA, which is linked to the early Dravidians. Similarly Narasimhan et al. 2018 and 2019 notes that the \u201cIranian\u201d or \u201cZagros farmers\u201d are directly linked to the Dravidians and formed the predominant main ancestry of the ancient Indus civilization and modern South Asians, next to the Indo-Aryan ancestry, while the native hunger hunter gatherers ancestry makes up only a minority and is even not found in northwestern Indians at all. (For more informations about the Indo-Aryans, see: Alexei Muraki's answer to Who are the Indo-Aryans?   (Famous sculpture of a IVC man, possibly a priest) Some recent studies: A study from 2015 concluded: \u201cThe presence of mtDNA haplogroups (HV14 and U1a) and Y-chromosome haplogroup (L1) in Dravidian populations indicates the spread of the Dravidian language into India from west Asia (Sengupta et al. 2006; Sahoo et al. 2006; Derenko et al. 2014).\u201d A genetic and biogeographical study from Das et al. 2016 concluded an ancient Western Asian origin for the Dravidian peoples and support a Caucasoid (West-Eurasian) origin of proto-Dravidians which form the main stock of modern Indians. According to the study, these proto-Dravidians migrated into India around 4,000 BC from a region later known as Elam in modern day Iran. The authors suggest that this results support the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis. Another study published in 2018 again confirmed that Dravidians are linked to Neolithic Zagros Mountain farmers, and that this West Asian population builds the main ancestor of modern South Asians. \u2192 The \u201cIranian farmers\u201d or \u201cZagros farmers\u201d also known as the proto-Dravidians came from Western Asia (somewhere in Iran) during the neolithic period and are the main ancestry component of modern Indians. Here some information about DNA and genetics: The Dravidian DNA and lineages (haplogroups) are all of West-Eurasian origin. Dravidians have predominantly haplogroup L, H, while haplogroup J is also common. Here the specific distribution: Haplogroup L:  (Haplogroup L was most common in ancient Iran and today widespreaded.) Haplogroup H:  (Interesingly, haplogroup H was also common in ancient Europeans and is still found there.) Additionally a recent genetic study about autosomal DNA (full genetic analysis) published in the \"European Journal of Human Genetics\" in Nature (2019) showed that most populations of South Asia, Western Asia, Northern Africa, Europe and parts of Central Asia are closely related to each other. These mentioned groups can be clearly distinguished from most populations in East Asia or Western Africa and Africans south of the Sahara. Who are Dravidians? Ancient Dravidians today are the speakers of the Dravidian languages. Modern Dravidians include ethnic non-Dravidian groupsare Caucasoid. Most modern South Asians are Caucasoid. But some, such as many most tribals that adopted the Dravidian language. So today, Dravidian is mostly a linguistic group, nevertheless, many Dravidian speakers have retained ancestry from the proto-Dravidians. Ancient Dravidians are classificated as \u201cCaucasoid\u201d. Most modern South Asians are Caucasoid. (Some, such as a noteable number of tribals and some other groups, are mixed or non-Caucasoid. The Paniya tribe as example has more than 60% Andamanese-related (Negrito) DNA. Modern Dravidian people are classified through the language they speak. This means also other ethnic groups which adopted the Dravidian languages are called \u201cDravidian\u201d. So some Dravidian-speaking groups may have more hunter gatherer (Andamanese-related) ancestry. The same applies to Indo-Aryan groups too. Most Dravidians, such as Tamils have predominant agriculturalists ancestry and are Caucasoid. Thank you for reading. :) ",
