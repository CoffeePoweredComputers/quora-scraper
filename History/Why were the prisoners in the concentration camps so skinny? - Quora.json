            "answer_text": "If it's German concentration camps you're referring to, there were 2 types of camps: Death Camps and Work Camps. Death Camps were just that, prisoners were transported to the camp and murdered en mass.  Only exception was these camps usually employed a relatively small work force of prisoners for the dirty work of disposing of corpses. The choice for these prisoners was simple, help dispose of the dead or become one of them. Work Camps were different. Rather than executing inmates outright, they used the ones who arrived healthy enough for work. Here rations were deliberately kept below the minimum needed to sustain life so basically inmates slowly starved until they either were too weak to work or caught some disease at which time they went to a \"hospital\" where they were executed. The only ones exempt from slow execution by starvation were those who managed to be useful to the camps. ",

They were fed moldy bread and watery stew with little or no nutritional value. On top of this, they were forced to do manual labor. When you are burning so many calories that you don\u2019t have\u2026well, you don\u2019t gain weight. You loose whatever weight you have as your body cannot sustain itself. Your body will use whatever it can to survive. They weren\u2019t able to add any muscle or fat or any weight to their bodies because of the lack of food and their conditions. Many also grew sick and were unable to eat or gain weight. ",
