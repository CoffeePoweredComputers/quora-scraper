            "answer_text": "How different is Russia east of the Urals from Russia west of the Urals? That's a better way to phrase the question, and it's a good question. Some places in Siberia (Russia east of the Urals) are very, very different from the rest of Russia. In some places, Russian is barely even spoken. There are places in Siberia where the only people are bands of nomadic caribou herders who speak Asian languages. There are also settled villages of non-Russian speakers with customs very different from Russian customs. But on the the whole, Siberia is very Russian. Large cities are inhabited by large Russian populations. The Russian spoken east of the Urals does not sound a lot different from the Russian spoken in, say, Moscow or Leningrad. To my ears, it's no greater a difference than that between the English spoken in Pennsylvania and the English spoken in Utah, for example. So some things about Siberia are very different from the rest of Russia and some things are very much the same. ",

Remember this planet \u201cpoint of cold\u201d where the lowest Northern semisphere temperature was registered (minus 57 C) is Siberia (Oimyakon), Culture and people at first look are not much different, but if you look closer they are: the people are tougher and more direct and honest. Not so much in cities but in small towns and villages. During WWII if you were at a front line the best you could hope that on your flanks are Siberian divisions: they were made of steel, no talk, fought till the end. I speak out of personal experience having visited Western Siberia small town/village: \u201cWesterners\u201d i.e. Russians from Central Russia are not mixing with the locals - the town had almost official line - here are the locals, there are the \u201cWesterners\u201d. Obviously everything I say is just personal opinion. So take it with a grain of salt. ",

Of course there really only one continent - Eurasia . The Ural mountains divide Russia from Sibirea which is really just a region of Russia. Siberia was added to Russian territory during the rule of Ivan the Terrible and was really conquered by a bunch of Cossack under a leadership of Ermak. That guy didn't just double the size of Russia but actually made it the largest country on Earth. Siberia is so huge it's about the size of continental US if not larger. It's also the source of Russian oil, gold, diamonds, aluminum not to mention the best fishing and hunting. Lake Baikal is the deepest and one of the most beautiful lakes on Earth. If you ever decide to visit Siberia make sure you bring all the winter clothes you have or if you do it in summer time -a lot of bug repellent:) ",

            "answer_text": "First, it is scarcely populated. Second, it has big logistics problems. Transportation is really tough and really expensive question. I talk about polar regions. Little villages are located in distance with each other. In Siberian polar regions big schools with living spaces where children live from autumn to spring are common thing from Soviet Union. Aircrafts are the only one transportation that exist all the time of the year in polar regions. In the summer they have rivers, in the winter roads. Villages and towns smaller. Permafrost is common thing. Buildings on piles are common on permafrost. Wells don't work in permafrost. Second windows for cars in winter, blankets for cars in winter, car used only in summer are more common. Things and food usually more expensive because of transportation cost. Internet is more expensive and in some places there is only satellite internet. Fur is more common in winter. Hunting, hiking, fishing are more common leisure. People usually understand that bears near inhabitant places must be killed because they are considered as danger. Siberia have more strong relationships with Asian countries than with Europe. People can go on vacation in Thailand China South Korea some even go in Japan. You can see more Japan and Asian cars in the roads, all this right wheel cars. People can emigrate in China or go in China for education, China has free education on English language. People can go there to make business relationships or work there. ",
