            "answer_text": "These are the possible avenues to Brazilian citizenship. You are probably not eligible for some of them, but I will mention all: You were born in Brazil and have lived here throughout your formation years until 18.You were born in Brazil, raised abroad since a very early age, but did not express your desire to forsake your citizenship.You were born abroad, to at least one Brazilian parent, but you were registered as a Brazilian citizen at the local embassy or consulate as soon as you were born.You were born abroad, to at least one Brazilian parent, but he/she was a Brazilian diplomat.You were born abroad, to at least one Brazilian parent, but came to Brazil just before turning 18 and opted for the citizenship.These above are the ways by which you are a native Brazilian. Speaking the language is not even an issue, though you will probably have little use for your new-found citizenship if you can\u2019t. But there are other easier ways: You were born abroad, to at least one Brazilian parent, were not registered, did not come before 18 to opt in for the citizenship, but did come later and did opt in.You marry a Brazilian native citizen (a common-law marriage equivalent is available in the form of a \u2018stable union\u2019, which is also available for homosexual partnerships and can be converted into a \u2018marriage\u2019 at some registry offices) and live in the country for some years (the marriage itself grants you permanent resident status).You and your spouse come to Brazil to have your baby born (anchor baby), then you register him/her at the local registry office (this gives you both permanent resident status) and live in the country for some years.You come to Brazil under a temporary residence visa, live some years, learn the language, work, build an estate, abide by the law and apply for citizenship.I am not a lawyer, but these are interpretations of the relevant articles on the constitution.

            "answer_text": " Foreigners can get Brazilian citizenship if they have resided continuously in Brazil for 15 years and have no criminal record. However, this period can be drastically reduced to four years, if the foreigner has permanent residence in Brazil, have sufficient knowledge of the Portuguese language (spoken, written and read), are employed or have sufficient monetary funds to support themselves and their family.  This four-year period can also be reduced if the resident has a spouse or a Brazilian child. In this case, you may get Brazilian citizenship after one year of residence in Brazil. If the resident has artistic skills, professional and scientific skills, it is eligible for Brazilian citizenship after two years. And after three years of permanent residence is entitled to apply for Brazilian citizenship to foreigners who have property or business volumes of certain value.  Naturalization Process The whole process of application to the Brazilian citizenship is taken over by the Ministry of Justice. The application process for the Brazilian citizenship is executed by the Ministry of Justice. Before approving the request, ministry officials will check, initially, the various documents that must be submitted with your application. The most important will be the criminal record, followed by the employment situation and financial position. In addition, the candidate should not have any income tax debts and must prove to have a good mental and physical health (this refers only to candidates applying for citizenship less than two years after obtaining permanent residence).  Dual nationality The Brazilian law allows dual nationality. However, for dual nationality, the two countries involved in the process (in this case Brazil and the country of origin) will have to allow dual nationality. For more information, check the Brazilian embassy and consulates in your home Country and also consult a attorney to make sure your country allows you to have dual citizenship.See You In Brazil bye from Mister Brazil Travels ",
