            "answer_text": "Landless peasants in India were bonded labourers. They were farmers who took loans from the rich people known as Zamindars with their agricultural land as a collateral against the loan. However, the Zamindars purposefully started to ask for compound interests and illegally kept the documents with themselves. Finally, in 1970s , this system was completely abolished and land reforms were initiated. However, not all Zamindars were unscrupulous because few of them owned the land through their ancestors. In this land reforms, they were affected too. My paternal grandfather was one such victim. The rules were that the tiller was the owner. A Zamindar had 20 farmers on his 100 acre land so each would get 5 acres & Zamindar wouldn't have any. Those Zamindars who owned more than 100 acres had to face more trouble through court orders and jails, etc in those days. The situation was extremely scary at that time as the government was hell bent on implementation in full force. I don't eugolize but want the youth in India who are for NRC to know that. NRC seeks land records of an individual prior to 1970s. Landless workers are those who don't own agricultural land but work per day on daily basis wages. ",

            "answer_text": "I can only answer for Eastern Europe. There a landless peasant was a euphemism for a slave. Slavery was made illegal as it was not taxable, under Peter the Great but people sold themselves for debt with no salary and if the debt was not paid in a year became a perpetual \u201clandless peasant\u201d. Unlike other serfs they went with the family not the estate if sold. A landless worker in Russia was something else. Half the peasants were free. They could move to town or work seasonally on estates helping with the harvest for a sum. ",
