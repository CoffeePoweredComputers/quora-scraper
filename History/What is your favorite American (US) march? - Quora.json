            "answer_text": "What is your favorite American (US) march? Anchors Aweigh. However, not just any Anchors Aweigh will do. There\u2019s a lot of Anchors Aweigh abominations out there. They are not subtle, have little sophistication, and throw away most of the march. They start with the trio and leave off the first two strains. The following performance is by a very good Japanese high school ensemble, and they perform Charles A. Zimmerman\u2019s Anchors Aweigh as it was intended, full bore, from the beginning, with all the subtlety and bombasticness the piece contains and deserves. This is not a watered-down for public consumption Anchors Aweigh. It goes places and knocks the barnacles off.  There\u2019s a good US Navy Band performance out there as well, but I couldn\u2019t find it. Most of the Anchors Aweigh recordings are arrangements and not the original. I actually have dozens of favorite marches from Spanish to British to German to American and many others, but I\u2019ll just leave you with John Williams\u2019 Midway March, another American nautical masterpiece. This march has a nice lilt to it, and is very cinematic, of course.  ",
