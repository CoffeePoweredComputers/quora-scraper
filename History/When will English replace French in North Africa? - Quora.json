            "answer_text": "Speaking as a native English speaker, I doubt seriously it will in the near future, if ever, though there may be more of a shift towards Arabic, and English being more widely taught in schools and universities. Such is the influence of the French language in the Maghreb region that when people watch US films and TV series, they are shown dubbed in French, as in France itself, even if they are also subtitled in Arabic. Given that French is stronger than English in Mauritius, despite it having been a British colony until 1968, with more daily newspapers and TV programmes in French than English, what chance is there of replacing it in the Maghreb? The most prominent case of a shift from French to English in Africa in recent times was in Rwanda, where there was a massive influx of people who returned from exile in English-speaking countries like Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. This even included the current President, Paul Kagame, who was raised in Uganda and served as an army officer. As a result, there was a large number of people who were in a position to impose English as an official language. By contrast, the Maghreb diaspora in English-speaking countries is much smaller, with Moroccans far more likely to emigrate to the Netherlands and Germany than to Britain or the US, meaning that English is not widely used. After Arabic, the language that people in the diaspora are likely to speak fluently is far more likely to be French, while France and Belgium will also have close trade links with the Maghreb region, conducted through French. Admittedly there has been a shift to English in the north of Belgium, but that is due to factors like Dutch being closely related to English, the proximity to Britain, and the use of English as a lingua franca in northern Europe.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll speak for Morocco \u2026 When our country is no longer under the crushing French influence; economical, political and cultural. When our country starts conducting its foreign policy in English and Arabic. When our policy makers make decisions without consulting the master in Paris. (sarcasm). Unlike other 18th century colonial powers, France managed to keep a tight relationship with its old colonies in Africa. The later is usually subordinate linguistically and economically, and its economy is an almost exclusive market to the former. Despite 60+ years of independence, current Morocco still can\u2019t escape the strong French grip. See some examples below. Mediocre Education ? More French please !2019 proposed legislation further shows Morocco\u2019s inexplicable commitment to promoting the status of the French language by making it a primary language of instruction in elementary schools. This is part of the country\u2019s never-ending, always failing, attempts at educational reforms. These look more like an ongoing experiment where the lab rats are the general population, and the undesirable side effects are missed opportunities and low HDI.No French No Admission.Admission interviews to post-secondary STEM schools are all in French. Same thing goes for the job market. These are carefully designed to weed out he or she who is not fluent-enough in the French language.The country is loosing big time with this; cutting out aspiring engineers and doctors from pursuing careers and climbing the social ladder. Yet, policy makers seem to be OK with it. Mind boggling !Why give the deal to China and not us ??!!Late December 2019, rumors coming from diplomatic circles has it that the French are mad because Morocco\u2019s thinking about giving the Marrakech-Agadir railway deal to China ! I can\u2019t say no more.A similar situation happened few years back when Morocco, after a prolonged period of hesitation, decided to finally purchase American F16s instead of French Rafale.",
