            "answer_text": "Now there are many valid points put forward in other answers. Germany were well and truly defeated and in full scale retreat on virtually every front, the allies didn\u2019t fancy the cost of another D-Day in Japan etc. For me, the answer to the question lies in another question\u2026 Why did the US drop 2 atomic bombs on a country that was in every real sense already defeated? The true reason was the massive and by now formidable Red Army currently occupying the whole of Eastern Europe, the Eastern Baltic and Balkans. The cracks in the relationship between the big 3 had been showing for some time and now there was a real tangible fear that the US and Britain now raced a diametrically opposed ideology with the means if not the intention to dictate precisely how the new map of Europe would be drawn. The US needed to ensure that an emboldened Soviet Union was given cause to reconsider any thought of advancing further West. It\u2019s not inconceivable that had the bombs been available earlier that they could\u2019ve been used in Germany but it would\u2019ve simply been too close to so many newly liberated allied nations not to mention the common history which tied the US to so many parts of Europe. Japan however offered the US 2 key benefits as a potential to \u201ctest\u201d of the new weapons. Island nation offering a multitude of largely symbolic targets a good distance from any friendly assets.Revenge. The potential political \u201cfallout\u201d of dropping such a weapon, never mind two, on the nation that had dragged the US reluctantly into the war in the first place was always going to be less of an issue than dropping them on a country that was home to the relatives/ancestors of thousands of US citizens.",

            "answer_text": "A few reasons I\u2019d say. Germany was beaten. Militarily and psychologically they were done.Landing boots on an Island is a lot more costly than walking into a mostly land locked country. Two MASSIVE military forces were executing the world\u2019s largest pincer movement on Germany.Japan was ready to have women, children, old men, anyone who could put up any kind of fight was preparing to defend the beaches. The loss of otherwise innocent life would have been incredibly high.I think the US was tired. The Island hopping campaign was intense. The troops were exhausted. Nobody actually wanted to invade Japan. Atomic bombs were thought to be enough to break the will of the Japanese and force surrender.",
