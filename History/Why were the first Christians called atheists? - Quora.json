            "answer_text": "Because they followed a God unlike the gods then known. The gods of the ancient world were in many ways like people. They were anthropomorphized. They came down and participated in human foibles, even having sex with humans. Half of Greek mythology is \u201cand then Zeus couldn't keep it in his toga.\u201d The Christian God wasn't like that. The Christian God was more, we might say in modern parlance, mystical. The Christian God appeared in a pillar of fire, in a whirlwind, in tongues of fire. The Christian God wasn't embodied like Zeus. The one prominent time the Christian God did become embodied it was in the form of a peasant of a persecuted religious sect that would hang out with ungodly people and eventually die the most humiliating death imaginable, supposedly out of love for even those society saw as less than human. Christians were accused of being atheists because their idea of God was so radically different than that of the other people of the Mediterranean Basin.. ",

            "answer_text": "The meaning of the word \"atheist\" is a person who actively rejects a god. Many people call themselves atheists, but they are unbelievers. They have a passive outlook - live yourself and let others live. Atheists have an active worldview that they tell other people. The early Christians actively told the polytheists (pagans) that their Greek / Roman gods did not exist. The pagans called these Christians atheists because they did not believe in their 100 (or more) \u0430 gods. Christians believe in only one God, but to the pagans this concept was alien and incomprehensible. ",
