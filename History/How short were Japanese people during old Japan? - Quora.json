            "answer_text": "There are many problems that prevent your question from being answered. What do you mean by \"old japan\"? If you mean 8th century Japan, there are no reliable records of height, so your question is impossible to answer. If you go the other way, and only look at recent records, the height of humanity in general has changed radically over just the past 130 years. Men's height in Europe went from an average of 164cm to modern-day 175cm. Similarly, average men's height in Japan went from 158cm to modern-day 173cm. So, any guess for a time period before that would be just that, a guess. I'm sorry, but your question cannot be answered. Also, there's no point to your question. The only thing I can think is that you are writing a piece of historical fiction, in which case you can just make it up. I can't see it as an important plot point. ",
