            "answer_text": "I think you have been mislead in your history reading. Firstly the Battle of Hastings was a close run affair and a brutal battle. Secondly the matter did not end with that Battle. Here is an extract from The world's leading serious history magazine - sorry if its a bit long but there is a lot to say - \u201cThe Battle of Hastings is the most famous event of the Norman Conquest, but it was only the opening engagement in the invaders' consolidation of power in England. For several years afterwards, the country was riven by internal conflict as the Normans fought to extend their rule, climaxing in a notorious campaign known today as the \u2018Harrying of the North\u2019. The Harrying, which took place over the winter of 1069\u201370, saw William\u2019s knights lay waste to Yorkshire and neighbouring shires. Entire villages were razed and their inhabitants killed, livestock slaughtered and stores of food destroyed. This scorched-earth operation is one of the defining episodes of the Conquest, not just from a military-political perspective but also in terms of how it has shaped modern perceptions of the Normans as a tyrannical and merciless warrior class. But why were such brutal measures considered necessary and why was the north in particular targeted? By the winter of 1069, the Norman war machine had been active in the field for more than three years. Throughout 1067 and 1068 there had been a succession of localised revolts and incursions by foreign foes in various corners of the country \u2013 Devon, Kent, Herefordshire and the midland earldom of Mercia \u2013 although each of these was swiftly put down. Castles were established, including in the major towns of Warwick, Nottingham, York, Lincoln, Huntingdon and Cambridge, in an effort to quell the disturbances and impose control. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that, even by the beginning of 1069, William was still not master of the entire kingdom. His authority extended no further north than York and it was in the region beyond that the greatest threat to his rule lay. William\u2019s early attempts to bring the northerners under his heel had involved appointing native English earls to govern them: first Copsig and then Gospatric. Both appointments had been dismal failures: the former was assassinated by a rival in 1067; the latter defected in 1068 to the midland rebels. Finally, in January 1069, William sent one of his own men, Robert Cumin, at the head of an army to conquer the region by force, only for them to be ambushed and slaughtered at Durham.  Worse was to come. That summer the Normans found themselves at the centre of a perfect storm, as their enemies all began marching at once. Foremost among them was a coalition of Northumbrian noblemen, including Gospatric but led by Edgar \u00c6theling, then around 17 years old and making a fresh bid for the crown, having already been briefly acclaimed king in London following Harold\u2019s death in 1066. The Northumbrian threat was compounded in August when a Danish invasion fleet numbering some 240 or 300 ships \u2013 depending on which source we believe \u2013 arrived in the Humber. The two forces swiftly formed an alliance and together attacked York. Meanwhile there was further trouble on the Welsh border, where a rebellious thegn named Eadric had joined forces with the Welsh kings and the men of Chester. In the south-west, the men of Devon and Cornwall were in revolt. It is unlikely that these risings were co-ordinated; the impression given by the sources is that their timing was coincidental. But the crisis nonetheless tested the Normans to the limit and marked a crucial turning point in the Conquest. Leaving the problem of the south-western insurrection to his deputies, William first confronted the Welsh and their allies, crushing them at Stafford, before marching north. He eventually reached York a little before Christmas, only to find that, on hearing of his approach, the Northumbrians and their Danish allies had strategically withdrawn: the former to their hiding-places in the hills and woods; the latter to their ships in the Humber. Frustrated by his inability to meet his principal enemies in battle, William was forced to adopt a new strategy. He secretly approached the Danes, promising them a vast amount of silver and gold if they would leave England in the spring, to which they readily agreed. That accomplished, William then turned his attention to the recalcitrant Northumbrians, who had proven a perennial thorn in his side. Shortly after Christmas in 1069 he divided his army into raiding-parties, which he dispatched to carry out the Harrying.\u201d So, far from \u201cso little difficulty\u201d, there were many years of civil unrest, revolt and insurrection throughout the land, together with what we would now term \u201cgenocide\u201d of the inhabitants of the North East of England. this had an effect on the region for generations, this is from Wiki- Contemporary biographers of William considered it to be his cruelest act and \"stain upon his soul\". Writing about the Harrying of the North, over fifty years later, the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis wrote (summarized): The King stopped at nothing to hunt his enemies. He cut down many people and destroyed homes and land. Nowhere else had he shown such cruelty. This made a real change. To his shame, William made no effort to control his fury, punishing the innocent with the guilty. He ordered that crops and herds, tools and food be burned to ashes. More than 100,000 people perished of starvation.I have often praised William in this book, but I can say nothing good about this brutal slaughter. God will punish him. The land was ravaged on either side of William's route north from the River Aire. His army destroyed crops and settlements and forced rebels into hiding. In the New Year of 1070 he split his army into smaller units and sent them out to burn, loot, and terrify. Florence of Worcester said that from the Humber to the Tees, William's men burnt whole villages and slaughtered the inhabitants. Food stores and livestock were destroyed so that anyone surviving the initial massacre would succumb to starvation over the winter. The survivors were reduced to cannibalism. Refugees from the harrying are mentioned as far away as Worcestershire in the Evesham Abbey chronicle.In 1086, Yorkshire and the North Riding still had large areas of waste territory, the Domesday Book entries indicate wasteas est or hoc est vast (it is wasted) for estate after estate, in all a total of 60% of all holdings were waste. It states that 66% of all villages contained wasted manors. Even the prosperous areas of the county had lost 60% of its value compared to 1066. Only 25% of the population and plough teams remained with a reported loss of 80,000 oxen and 150,000 people\u201d So we are talking many many years of warfare before William was properly in charge, it was never easy.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that is how historians view it. The UK, which didn\u2019t exist then of course, is an island nation; getting troops there is the issue since marching across a continent is easier than shipping them, hence Napoleon\u2019s and Hitler\u2019s continental successes and failure to invade the UK. Not having to worry quite as much meant that you could get by with a smaller army and expense to defend the island. If someone successfully disembarked their odds would go up. The English were caught flat-footed. As wikipedia note: \u201cthe Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford, but Harold defeated and killed him at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Within days, William landed in southern England. Harold marched south to confront him, leaving a significant portion of his army in the north. Harold's army confronted William's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings; William's force defeated Harold, who was killed in the engagement\u2026William's main rivals were [now] gone.\u201d So the English had to fight on two fronts, and split their forces (usually a bad idea as it was here). They had to march south, also leaving them spent. The Normans had cavalry; the English did not. The Norman strategy of pretending to leave the field allowed them to attack the English who were fooled; also in an era when generals and kings took the field there was always the chance of the leader\u2019s death disenheartening the troops, and Harold had the bad luck to die. The Normans went on a castle-building spree that helped solidify their rule. They also absorbed Anglo-Saxon governing forms, always a good idea to avoid antagonism. Some of the prior lords were left their land to buy them off as well. ",
