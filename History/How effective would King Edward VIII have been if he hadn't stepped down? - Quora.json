            "answer_text": "If he was allowed to reign any longer than he did he would have been an unmitigated disaster as monarch. He was derelict in reading his boxes and following the advice of his ministers, was totally dominated by a woman who was beneath the standards of the Royal Family and this was all before World War II.
