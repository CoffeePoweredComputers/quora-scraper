            "answer_text": "1.  Gudrun Himmler was the daughter of Reichsf\u00fchrer of the SS, Heinrich Himmler. He was one of the most powerful men of Nazi Germany. Despite him being responsible for millions of deaths, his daughter always said he was misunderstood and tried to justify his crimes. Himmler would always fly her and his wife to come visit him when he was doing important things for the Reich. He referred to her as \u201ddoll\u201d and would take her everywhere he can just to spend more time with her. After he killed himself in 1945 after being captured, his daughter always insisted that someone murdered him instead. Gudrun always maintained a positive image of her father, despite his crimes against humanity. 2.  Edda G\u00f6ring was the daughter of Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring who was the Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe (Airforce of Nazi Germany). Despite his disregard for other human life, he was a good father figure to her. She went on to say that he wasn\u2019t really responsible for the deaths of so many Jews, but that he was too blinded by his loyalty to the F\u00fchrer as an important military figure. G\u00f6ring was the one who founded the Gestapo (secret police) anyway, who did arrest Jews. She never really hated him and always visited him when he was imprisoned during the Nuremberg Trials. 3.  Klaus, Dieter, Horst, and Ricardo Eichmann were the sons of Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer (Lieutenant Colonel) Adolf Eichmann who was in charge of deporting people to the death camps by train. His sons were always loyal to him and tried justifying his actions by saying \u201che was following orders,\u201d as Eichmann famously said during his court trial. His youngest son, Ricardo, was the only son to say his execution was justified and deserved. His other 3 sons were angered when he was executed that they started to attack Jews. 4.  Wolf Hess was the son of Reichsminister (& Deputy F\u00fchrer) Rudolf Hess who helped plan war, crimes, and had knowledge of the a Holocaust. Like the other kids of Nazi criminals, he always said his father was only following orders. He tried getting his father out of prison, but did not succeed. 5.  Ingebirgitt H\u00f6ss was among one of the 5 kids of Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer Rudolf H\u00f6ss who was the commandant of Auschwitz. His kids claimed that they never knew what was happening \u201con the other side of the fence.\u201d They claimed Rudolf was the greatest father ever and the nicest man ever. He would always tell to never hurt anyone. After the war, when they found out who he really was, they justified it by, of course, saying \u201cHe was following orders and had to do it, otherwise our family would\u2019ve been killed.\u201d LOL. Such bologna. EDIT: It\u2019s a common myth that Germans would be executed for disobeying orders. First of all, I\u2019m sure H\u00f6ss was one of many people that wanted to take the position of being commandant of Auschwitz. The job would give a nice home for you and your family, benefits, being away from the fighting, and and being close to your family. I\u2019m sure H\u00f6ss was the first one to snatch that up. If not, there were plenty of other LTC\u2019s that would take it. Executing a soldier for disobeying orders would result in the consequences for the executor. There are stories of officers getting in trouble for even threatening soldiers with execution for disobeying orders. Disobeying orders would result in extra details (depending how severe), or the soldier would be transferred else where. Himmler and Hitler emphasized this. Germany needed every abled body. Besides, execution for disobeying orders would scare the soldier into desertion, which was an execution. ",

            "answer_text": "I met the grandson of a war criminal. Not one of the famous war criminals. It clearly bothered him because he had to deal with traits that are transmitted. To make myself clear, if it\u2019s your father, then you have experiences of that person as a father, as the person you loved when love was unconditional. But if it\u2019s your grandfather, whom you may not have known, you have to wonder what was in him that has come down to you through your parent. What in him could enable him to act that way? What of that is in me? Then, my assumption, is the meaning fades over time. An extreme example is that President John Tyler has living grandchildren, though Tyler was born in the 18thC and was President before the Civil War. They did not know John Tyler, but their parent did (and knew the woman who was married to him). That\u2019s about as far apart as human lives can stretch over a span of personal family direct knowledge of 1 to 1 to 1. So they are a step removed from the slave era, but they are of course far removed from the slave era. My own grandparents were born around the turn of the last century. This connects me to the way they saw the world because I knew them and knew how they saw the world we shared. Take that experience and make it great or make it horrible: you share space and genetic connection to someone who shared space and genetic connection going back in time, and you can see how it works between you, so you can imagine more of this remote person by seeing that person in you. We see this all the time: people dig up some way back relationship to someone famous or they can prove their ancestor was on the Mayflower or was in the American Revolution, and that makes you better, though the DNA connection between you is negligible. You imagine the good traits are part of you, so it makes sense that you fear seeing yourself in the bad ones in your lineage. This is what motivates a lot of the direct children of war criminals: a noted reluctance to look at what might be inside themselves. Another answer already mentions a book about many of the children. It\u2019s hard to look a things you dont want to see inside yourself. Some of the children are interesting, others not. There is another book out by the adopted daughter of Amon G\u00f6th\u2019s daughter: My Grandfather Would Have Shot Me - Wikipedia. Jennifer Teege is half-Nigerian and lived in Israel. As a note, G\u00f6th never met Teege\u2019s mother, who was born in late 1945. Teege only discovered her family history as an adult when she picked up a book at the library. ",
