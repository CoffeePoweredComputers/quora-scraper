            "answer_text": "Hello are you really a true and skilled nature-healer, or just a wicca, a believer in the new age religion called \"wicca\" invented by the Englishman Gerald Gardner in the 1950's? Gardner claimed (wrongly), that Wicca has its origin, in what he called \"the original witch-religion\", (the idea was published by Gardner in a book 1954). Facts is: No evidence has ever been found that there ever existed a \"witch religion\". It's much more probably, that the so-called \"witches\", which originally was intelligent women with an extensive knowledge of healing plants, had the exact same religion, as the people the took care of, and tried to cure with the medicine they made from the herbs of the forest.

            "answer_text": "I had to ask Judith Martin (Miss Manners) about that. She suggested, \u201chow do you do?\u201d. Seriously, though, what you do is exactly the same thing that you do when you see a Baptist, a Catholic, a Jew, a Muslim, a Buddhist, et cetera. Why should you need to do anything different? Just try to hide your inherent bias against witches and be polite and respectful. Wicca is a spiritual path. Witchcraft may also include various spiritual paths. Unless you have measurable and quantifiable proof that they deserve less respect, just be nice, be polite, and maybe be surprised. ",
