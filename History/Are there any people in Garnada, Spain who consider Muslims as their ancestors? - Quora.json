Actually, practically all will recognize that either at first or as an afterthought. Considering the number of anyone\u2019s ancestors gets exponentially huge with each generation as you go back in anyones genealogy tree and the fact Muslims were living in the Iberian peninsula for quite a long time, it would rather be really difficult (rather, practically impossible) for anyone to totally lack Muslim ancestors and have zero Muslim ancestors. But that\u2019s it. People don\u2019t go around giving it much importance. ",
