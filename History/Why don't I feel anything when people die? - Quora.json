            "answer_text": "A2A Feeling sadness or grief when someone dies has to do with your ability to place emotional weight to projected outcomes. Or put simply - being reflexive.  The reason why most people are feed sad when loved ones die is because they are directly involved in the outcomes of that that death. So let's say a parent dies you know that now you'll never be able to speak with them ever again. Never be able to ask advice or share experiences, etc. That lack in your projected future makes you sad.  The reason why some people feel sad about death in general is because they are able to put themselves in the shoes of either the person who has died or their loved ones. And so they feel the loss of the projected outcomes without that person.  There are also some people who are inherently sympathetic - so they get sad because others are sad.  So the reason why someone wouldn't feel anything when a person dies is because they probably have a very pragmatic - present focused view of the situation.  The person is dead - that's it.  The death of a person (tragic as it can be) isn't inherently sad - hence no feeling. It's the lost potential that's sad and if you don't really consider a future where that person is missing then you're not going to feel sad. If a neighbor dies and all you ever did was say \"Hi\" on occasion there's really nothing you'd feel sad about - unless if those greetings meant the world to you.  All that said I don't particularly think it's anything to be overly concerned about. Feeling sad because of death is a societal norm but if you lack this emotional response it doesn't make you a bad person.  If death made you happy or excited then that would be an issue. Feeling nothing just means that you haven't felt sympathy for those who feel the loss and you don't feel any projected loss yourself. In the absence of info about who has died in your life I can't say that that's necessarily a bad thing. Sadness is a terrible emotion after all.  Best of Luck Em Putting You in Front! ",

            "answer_text": "I am the person who wrote the question and I\u2019m adding some background here: Basically I have never cared at all when someone dies, whether a loved family member or a stranger. I am also always super confident about everything no matter what. I used to think that it was normal but now I\u2019m pretty certain it\u2019s not. If I felt anything it would be something like excitement because of a new \u201cadventure\u201d in my life or just boredom because I wish some people would just get over it and move on. I\u2019m also considerably selfish, unempathetic, and extremely confident. When I say this people usually would just say \u201coh you\u2019re a sociopath\u201d but I don\u2019t think so really. I don\u2019t really \u201cmanipulate\u201d people to much; maybe get a better grade on the finals, get my friends to give me a buck or two when necessary, but everyone does that. I do feel guilty sometimes, never really when I hurt someone's feelings though. And most of all I do like to be around people a lot. I also am definitely a narcissist. But I just don\u2019t care, like at all. Is there like any real reason why I\u2019m like this? Is it normal (rhetorical, obviously it\u2019s not)? Is there something I should do to help it (and please don\u2019t say something like \u201cthink about how others feel\u201d because that doesn\u2019t work, they are just stupid to care so much on what they can\u2019t change! On the plus the should just be looking at all the sympathy they are getting, surely they\u2019ll get something out of it much better than one human\u2019s life, right?)? Edit: Here are some examples for those wondering: Pet bird died when I was a little kid, friend was shot and killed as a teen, aunt died (unknown cause), was literally sitting next to my grandmother (had a close bond) when she died.
