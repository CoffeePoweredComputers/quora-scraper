            "answer_text": "According to the third-century AD Greek biographer Diogenes La\u00ebrtios in his book Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, Plato\u2019s original name was \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c2 (Aristokl\u00eas), after his grandfather. Supposedly, the name Plato (\u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd in Greek) was given to him by his wrestling coach Ariston of Argos as a nickname on account of his \u201cbroad\u201d shoulders, or perhaps his \u201cbroad\u201d forehead, since the Greek word meaning \u201cbroad\u201d is \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c2 (plat\u00fds). Later writers claimed that he had received the nickname due to the breadth of his thought. Modern historians are unsure of whether or not to take Diogenes La\u00ebrtios\u2019s account at face value, since he was writing centuries after Plato\u2019s death and all of the manuscripts of Plato\u2019s dialogues clearly give their author\u2019s name as \u201cPlato,\u201d not \u201cAristokles.\u201d Plato was a common name in Athens at the time when Plato was alive. In fact, there were at least thirty-one other men named Plato in Athens from around the same time period, so it was not necessarily a nickname or, if it was a nickname, it was apparently a very common one. Nonetheless, there are no records of Plato having had any relatives with this name and it was traditional for sons to be named after their paternal grandfathers. For my own part, I rather suspect that the story may be accurate, since it does not really seem like the sort of thing biographers would be inclined to make up and it is widely reported in the biographical sources, late though they are. In any case, though, certainly by the time he started writing dialogues, Plato was only known by one name: Plato.
