            "answer_text": "Well, as a formal institution unis have their origin in the Medieval Christian tradition. European higher education took place for hundreds of years in cathedral schools or monastic schools, in which monks & nuns taught classes. These were the immediate forerunners of the later uni in many places. The earliest unis were developed protected by the Latin Church by papal bull as studium generale & perhaps from cathedral schools. Later they were also founded by Kings or municipal administrations. In the Early Middle Ages, most new unis were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that cathedral schools & unis were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries. Pope Gregory VII was critical in promoting & regulating the concept of modern uni as his 1079 Papal Decree ordered the regulated establishment of cathedral schools that transformed themselves into the 1st European unis. The 1st unis in Europe with a form of corporate/guild structure were the Uni of Bologna (1088), the Uni of Paris (c. 1150), & the Uni of Oxford (1167). The Uni of Bologna began as a law school teaching the jus gentium of peoples which was demanded across Europe for those defending the right of incipient nations against church & empire. Bologna\u2019s special claim to Alma Mater Studiorum is based on its autonomy, its awarding of degrees, & other structural arrangements, making it the oldest continuously operating institution independent of emperors, kings, or any kind of direct religious authority. The conventional date of 1088, or 1087 according to some, records when Irnerius commenced teaching Justinian I\u2019s 6th-century codification of Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis, then recently found at Pisa. Lay students arrived in the city from many lands entering into a contract to gain this knowledge, organising themselves into \u201cNationes\u201d, divided between that of the Cismontantes & that of the Ultramontanes. In Europe, young men proceeded to uni when they had completed their study of the trivium & the quadrivium. All over Europe rulers & city governments began to create unis to satisfy a European desire for knowledge, & the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions. Princes & leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems & achieve desired ends. The emergence of humanism was essential to this knowledge of the possible utility of unis as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts. The rediscovery of Aristotle\u2019s works fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century. Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history. Richard Dales, for example, calls the finding of Aristotle\u2019s works \u201c\u2026a turning point in the history of Western thought.\u201d. The uni culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south, although the northern & southern unis did have many common elements. Professors lectured the books of Aristotle for logic, metaphysics, & natural philosophy; while Avicenna, Galen, & Hippocrates were used for medicine. Outside of such commonalities, great differences separated north & south, primarily regarding the subject matter. Italian unis focused on law & medicine, while the northern focused on the arts (as well as theology). ",
