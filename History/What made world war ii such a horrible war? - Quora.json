            "answer_text": "The modern philosophy of \"Total War.\" In the past, before the notion of the modern nation-state, wars were fought by a ruling elite for the control of territory operating in some part under rules of Western \"chivalry.\"  Mostly the peasants helped their lords by farming the land or producing goods, but regardless of which elite won a war, the lot of the peasants was  without much change. Peasants were exempt from service in many cases, and, without modern weaponry, damage to their property was minimized. Yet starting with the American and French revolutions (and, say, the \"guerillas\" of the Spanish resistance to the French occupation under Napoleon), and increasing decade by decade over the Industrial Revolution, the separation of \"the people,\" the \"soldiery\"  and the \"state\" began to narrow. Wars were increasingly brutal affairs, and the lines between \"civilian\" and \"combatant\" began to be erased. In the decades leading to World War II, the revolutionary and radicalized philosophical and political concept of nation-states had grown so powerful as to encompass all aspects of life. Governments controlled industry and production (both in Fascist and Communist states), religion (in Communism, there was forced atheism by the state), media (state-run radio stations), and so on. And even if this were not altogether true in democracies or monarchies, they needed to adopt similar strategies and operational realities to counter the more radical states that promulgated the Second World War. Commensurately, all civilian efforts were geared towards the readiness and support of the military in the field. There were civilian war efforts that called every man, woman, and child to do their part for the war effort. In response, since they were indirectly or directly part of the war effort, terror bombing and strategic bombing campaigns seemed the next \"logical\" step. It meant civilian populations were now permissible as targets. When Guernica, an entirely civilian population, was bombed in the Spanish Civil War, it led to shock and horror around the world. But during the escalation of World War II year-over-year, it became increasingly acceptable, encouraged, and embraced by every high command, and every populace. From the terror raids on London to the firebombings of Dresden and Tokyo, people wanted blood to pay for blood. Demands for unconditional surrender required the breaking of the national will. It required not just defeat of political or military leaders, but the capitulation of the entire civilian population. It was unprecedented in scale, and unprecedented in modern times that civilian casualty rates were purposefully maximized. While barbarian wars of ancient eras were certainly genocidal, they lacked the modern weapon systems that made the mass extermination of entire populations possible. All means to exterminate civilian populations were utilized: bombings and shellings, individual assassinations, machine-gunning of captives and genocidal mass-executions, even disease and starvation were used as a means to deprive nations of their civilian support structures. Military deaths in World War II were horrendous, and estimated between 20-25 million. Yet civilian deaths due to all causes (conflict, genocide, disease and starvation) were far greater, amounting to somewhere around 50-60 million. ",

            "answer_text": "First the level of industrial development of all the contenders.  Second the fact that it spread across the entire world, even though it involved a limited number of countries.Third, the fact that on the part of the Japanese it started in 1931, and involved the occupation of a large portion of China with a large population, and Japanese appalling mistreatment of their opponents and the conquered populations.Fourth the philosophies of the Axis Powers, primarily Nazi Germany and Japan.  Both were extremely harsh and contemptuoos of the conquered.  Neither Japan nor post WW1 Germany signed the Geneva Accords covering the treatment of civilians, restrictions of the air war, or treatment of prisoners of war.  Nor did the Soviet Union, which made them first the victims of the Nazis and then their persecutors.  Fewer than 10% of those captured at Stalingrad survived the war.Fifth the Nazi creed of the elimination of those deemed handicapped, especially mentally.Sixth the Nazi policy of anti-Semitism beginning in 1933 with less organized mistreatment, then following 1935 and the Nuremburg Laws which stripped German Jews regardless of how long they had lived there (centuries) of citizenship.  Then in 1936 the expulsion of Jews from the professions, and a year later from the civil service.The imposition of all the previous anti Jewish laws, not merely in Germany, but in every country they invaded or managed to ally with  and ultimately the 1942 decision at the Wannsee Conference to eliminate all the Jewish populations of all lands ruled by the Reich.Seventh the limited effectiveness of Air Warfare as a Strategic Weapon.Eighth, The weakness of colonial regimes in resisting Japanese aggression, viz  the US in the Philippines, the French in Indo China, the British in  Malaya and Burma, the Dutch in IndonesiaNinth and controversially, The lack of patience of the Truman Administration  regarding waiting a bit for the surrender of Japan.  (Attributed by some  to James Burns, Secretary of State, and a desire to frighten the pants  off Stalin and the Communists.)It is regrettable that the US failed to recognize just how weak the Japanese were and instead involved the Soviet Union in the conquest of Japan, which thethe Soviets did nothing to advance or participate in but were quick to bite off the end of Sakhalin Island.More than anything it was the perverted philosophies guiding both Germany and Japan's militarists, and the incredible industrial power available to create ever more destructive weapons.Essential unknown fact.  It cost more to develop the Boeing B-29, than it did to develop the Atom Bomb.  The Atom Bomb might have been dropped from an island closer to Japan by another aircraft.  ON the other hand, a wing or 4 of B-29s might have made a huge difference over Europe, where my father fought. ",
