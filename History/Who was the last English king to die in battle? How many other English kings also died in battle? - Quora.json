            "answer_text": "Richard III was the last english king to die in battle, 1485. He fought personally at the front of his men on horse, and was surrounded by welsh axe-men who pulled him from his horse (or he was already fighting on foot in the melee) and was killed. Some sources say he was held down, while having his helmet pulled off and then had half his head cut off. He shouted \u201ctreason!\u201d several time. Richard the lionhearted also was killed in battle. Shot by a crossbow bolt, during a siege. Richard saw the man taking aim, and mocked him to take the shot. Might have been suicide. He had suicidal tendencies in risk taking earlier in life, such as during the crusades. William I , the conqueror was also arguably killed in combat, as he fell from his horse and was killed during a siege. Obviously Harold Godwinson was also killed in battle, 1066. A petty king of the english, Edward The Elder, was also killed in some battle in the 900s. In addition a whole slew of pretenders, some with a very good claim, such as Henry VIs son, was killed in battle, or executed right after it. Said son was also the only heir apparent to the english throne ever killed in battle. ",

            "answer_text": "There were only two English monarchs to officially die on the battlefield: Harold II and Richard III. Harold II was supposedly killed by an arrow to his eye, though it\u2019s not confirmed, it IS confirmed he was actively killed in the Battle of Hastings (1066). Richard III was actively slain in the Battle of Bosworth Field (1485). Richard I did NOT actually die on the battlefield. He was injured by an arrow and developed gangrene in March 1199 and died in his mother\u2019s arms in April 1199, NOT on the battlefield. William I is similar. He sustained an injury in a siege in 1087, but did not die actively in battle. Here is the list of monarchs who didn\u2019t die in battle, but have been confirmed to have been killed or executed: (date-date) means reign, not lifespan Edmund I (939 \u2013 946), killed by a thief Edward the Martyr (975 \u2013 978) killed on the orders of Ethelred II\u2019s mother Edmund II (April 1016 - November 1016) killed whilst on the toilet (lol) William II (1087 - 1100) killed by an arrow, though it\u2019s unknown whether it was deliberate Richard I (1189 - 1199) shot with an arrow, died of gangrene Edward II (1307 - 1327) deposed and THEN killed by Edward III\u2019s mother, but most likely NOT with a red hot poker Richard II (1377 - 1399) deposed and THEN killed by the then Henry IV Henry VI (1422 - 1461, 1470 - 1471) deposed once in 1461, deposed again in 1471 and then killed in the Tower of London Edward V was never confirmed to have been killed, yet alone killed by Richard III. Jane Grey ( July 1553) deposed and THEN beheaded by Mary in 1554 Charles I (1625 - 1649) beheaded by Oliver Cromwell George V (1910 - 1936) injected lethally by some guy so his death would make the right newspaper (lol) ",
