            "answer_text": "The Palestinians are a mixed people. They state they are descendants of the Canaanites, ancient Hebrews, Arameans, Arabs from Arabia, Crusaders (French Franks, especially in Hebron), ancient Greeks, Phillistines, Ottoman Turks etc\u2026 Many Palestinians tend to talk more about being connected to Canaanites. Some talk about the Crusaders, Turks, Arabs. It\u2019s a mosaic. Some also speak of Jewish grandmothers or great-grandmothers. The people who inhabited Palestine in the 10th century didn\u2019t speak Arabic in their majority unbeknownst to many Palestinians. The majority of them actually spoke Syriac, which Syriac people call Suryoyo. Syriac was the dominant language in what is modern Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine until maybe the 12th century. The Maronites of Lebanon spoke mainly Syriac up to even the 1600s. The majority of Palestinians at that time were not connected to Arabs. Arabs did conquer Palestine and many Arab men did marry the local women, which is normal as their fewer women who come with conquests just as many Ashkenazi Jews descent on the paternal side from Jewish Semitic fathers and European mothers who converted. The majority of Palestinians would have also been Christian at the time. And there were also many Jews. Due to Hakim Bi Amrillah was a mentally unstable ruler in Egypt, many Jews and Christians felt scared of him and converted out of fear. I know people are taught that no one converted to Islam out of fear, but I am hear to tell you that it\u2019s not true, and not possible based on human history and psychology. We\u2019re all human beings. Yes, Palestinians do have Arab history. That\u2019s quite normal. Muslim Arabs conquered. Spaniards conquered Mexico. Does that mean most Mexicans are simply like Spanish Europeans. Definitely not. Many Israelis claim that Palestinians are undistinguishable from other Arabs, but Europeans who studied races back in the old days heavily disagreed. I read those old dusty books written by those Europeans. And the Europeans at that time didn\u2019t have a dog in the fight. They weren\u2019t focused on the fight of promoting Palestinians over Israelis or Israelis over Palestinians. They were just studying the peoples they saw in the region. You see there\u2019s a lot of propaganda between many Jews and Palestinians. You have some Palestinians who claim Ashkenazi European Jews are simply Turkic Khazars who converted to Judaism and have no ancestry from the Near East. Then, you have Jews who show no objectivity either and try to say Palestinians are indistinguishable from other Arabs. Well, if you compare Gulf Arabs to Palestinians or Egyptians to Palestinians, you will see clear differences. That\u2019s the reality. Also, one scholar who studied race (I hate to bring that up) showed that more north you go in the Middle East, the more people start having blood type A and move away from blood type O whereas in the Gulf, A is very rare and when you look at central to northern Palestine to Syria people start looking quite different than the people in the South. You can argue that the Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese look very similar. However, that was true for thousands of years. Palestine, after all, was called by Herodotus Syria-Palestine. I know many people say it was only something that started with the Romans, but that\u2019s not true. Herodotus was a Greek historian, not a Roman one. Another thing, many Palestinians would definitely have Greek ancestry more than Phillistine ancestry. Why? The Phillistines were concentrated near Gaza and Ashkelon. However, the Great Syria region had something called the Decapolis, which in Greek means the 10 cities. In reality, however, there were about 16 of those Greek cities. Later, in history, those Greek cities became satellite cities of the Byzantine Empire. And some speculate that Jesus would have possibly spoke Greek because the language of the Eastern Roman Empire was Greek, and right next to Nazareth was the Greek city of Sephoris. The Palestinians look more like Turks and Greeks than they do the people of Arabia, with all due respect to the people of Arabia. It\u2019s okay to look like whatever as human beings. I am only discussing history. Some European scholars have stated that the Palestinians who came from the cities often tend to look less Semitic than the people from the villages i.e. they had some more of the ancient European admixture. I am sure those historians examining the people knew what Arabians looked like. Some Jews try to look at the Old Testament and misinterpret history. Trying to look at the Quran or TORAH to understand history is rather complicated. Some claim that the Canaanites were exterminated. That\u2019s not historically accurate. After all, Solomon had good relations with Canaanites under the leadership of Hiram who was from what is now modern Lebanon. Hebrew is actually a Canaanite language. Abraham/Avraham, being born in Ur, in what is part of modern Iraq, wouldn\u2019t have spoken Canaanite or a Hebrew form of Canaanite as his mother tongue. Many Canaanites were assimilated and became Jews, truth be told. Someone cited Deuternomy. The reality is plenty of Canaanites remained and many assimilated into Jewish culture, as well. That would deal with a particular battles and context. The cultures were tribal, and your tribal God would be superior, and the Canaanites were more condemned for their religious beliefs. They weren\u2019t all universally slaughtered as some wrongly believe. That didn\u2019t happen. Scholars who study the Palestinian dialect of Arabic find that many of the words used in the colloquial, as distinguished from classical Arabic, uses a lot of Aramaic and Syriac words, which is normal. Of course, Aramaic and Syriac are similar to Arabic. In the end, if the majority of Palestinians in the 11th century spoke Syriac, they were obviously at that time not Arabian at that time, and I don\u2019t think in the ensuing centuries that ancestry simply disappeared. Anyway, having an objective discussion about this topic is difficult because you have a conflict where two people are fighting over the same real estate. ",

            "answer_text": "There are countless reasons why I'm unable to answer this question. There are numerous meanings of \u201cPalestinian\u201d across the millenia. For example, Jews living in the region prior to modern Israeli statehood in 1948 were \u201cPalestinian.\u201d So for any discourse on this, a definition has to be mutually understood. Perhaps my perspective is a product of Judaism itself being unfettered by issues of race. Anyone who chooses to can become a Jew. So when I think of \u201cPalestinian,\u201d it's in the context of a political reality. It doesn't matter if Newt Gingrich was right when in 2012 he told an interviewer that \u201c\u2026the Palestinians are an invented people.\u201d Are they? Of course. And others have already superbly articulated why they are. But the irony of Gingrich noting this as an attempt to delegitimize the Palestinians is that he is an American, of a nation that oozes pride in being an invented people. As a nation Israelis are an invented people. Even we Jews are an invented people. It's just that we invented ourselves thousands of years ago, that reality isn't given much attention. Having said all that, what's left is a national self-identity that is not going to be diminished in the slightest by historical reality. That toothpaste is not going back in the tube. The problem is the perverted self-defeating nature of Palestinian nationalism. Starting with its birth decades ago, it is a national self-identity that validates itself by invalidating Israel, its right to exist and even any Israeli's right to life itself. Palestinian nationalism also calls for the removal of all Jews from the West Bank, the very cradle of Jewish civilization. This is the complete cleansing of an ethnic group. (Unless I'm mistaken, ethnic cleansing is frowned upon.) Considering all this, even there was a grain of truth to this man's claim, would it matter? ",

Arafat used to declare that \u201cJesus was a Palestinian,\u201d a preposterous claim that echoes the words of Hanan Ashrawi, a Christian Arab who, in an interview during the 1991 Madrid Conference, said: \u201cJesus Christ was born in my country, in my land,\u201d and claimed that she was \u201cthe descendant of the first Christians\u201d.

            "answer_text": "The Palestinians are mostly Arabs, ethnically and culturally indistinguishable from other Arabs. Sometimes, Palestinian leaders falsely claim to be descendants of the Philistines or the Canaanites, more often the Canaanites, to argue that they preceded the Jews in the land, and therefore have a greater claim to the land. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, in a recent meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, quoted the Torah itself to establish that the Canaanites were in the land before the Israelites. But the Torah says some other things about the Canaanites that Abbas did not mention, such as the fact that the Canaanites were eternally cursed because of the behavior of the founder of their tribe (Genesis 9: 24\u201327) and the fact that when the Israelites were about to enter the Promised Land, God commanded them to exterminate the Canaanites to the last man, because they had polluted the land with their corruption (Deuteronomy 20: 16\u201318). So if the Palestinians wish to raise a false claim of being descended from the Canaanites, that should not be a problem for Israel, and might even help clarify their course of action. ",

In one speech Abbas claimed that the alleged Palestinian have been there for two million years. Another claim by one of the air heads in the Palestinian government is that they are the Romans. Abbas has also claimed they are the original Canaanites.Abbas also made the outrageous claim that Jesus was a Palestinian. Abbas also insisted that the Bible says, in these words, that the Palestinians existed before Abraham. Abbas also claims that the Palestinians created the Canaanite-Palestinian alphabet more than 6,000 years ago. ",

More of them claim Canaanite descent due to the invasive connotations of the Philistines. Equally unproven and unprovable. Their ancestors are in all likelihood a mix of the non-Jewish population of the land in the first half-millennium CE, and Arabs from Arabia. (George Antonius, the great Arab historian, claimed that Palestinians have the most Arabian blood of all Arab peoples outside of the Arabian peninsula itself.) ",
