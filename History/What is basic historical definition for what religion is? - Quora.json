There is no definition of \u201creligion\u201d that fits every religion, except, \u201ca set of views, beliefs, values, and teachings.\u201d And every human on the planet has one of those. Don\u2019t believe it? Religion and belief in god(s) are separate things. There are religions with no concept of god(s), and people most do not consider \u201creligious\u201d that believe in god(s).Religion is not ritual. There are religion which do not include rites and rituals, and plenty of rituals that are not religion-based.\u201cOrganized religion\u201d is not the only kind of religion there is. Every organized religion once had only one follower. It was the same set of ideas then. So is that set of ideas a \u201creligion\u201d when it has 4 followers? 10? 100? It\u2019s just a set of ideas, which every human has.There is really no substantive difference between people we normally call \u201creligious\u201d and those most do not. \u201cReligious\u201d and \u201cnon-religious\u201d are false identifiers.

Marx\u2019s contention was that religion gives people artificial, illusory happiness\u2014like opium does to a drug addict\u2014and freeing people from that unrealistic illusion was part of building a better society.
