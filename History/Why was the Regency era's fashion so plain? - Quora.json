            "answer_text": "The Regency Era happened during the period between 1795 to 1837, which included the influencing effects of the French Revolution, the Age of the Enlightenment, and the beginnings of many technologically and socially progressive global changes. It was a period for specifically British remembrance when George IV and his brother William IV, both prince regents, were put in charge of ruling the United Kingdom, because their father, King George III became ill and was deemed unfit to formally rule. The social attitude of this era tend to promote practicality in appareling choices for men since impracticality belongs to the egotistical, power hungry, and indulgent individuals. Society has this historical purpose to control people\u2019s choices as to what they can wear, which violates the natural way people are able to decide. Even the Enlightenment, with all its good intentions, strengthened this social hold that whittles down men\u2019s choices for appareling selections using practicality to promote its control. Why would men who work in environments that have to be aware of safety hazards, have the desire to wear impractical attire? If questions like this don\u2019t seem ridiculous, then I fear reasoning is a lost form of thinking. ",
