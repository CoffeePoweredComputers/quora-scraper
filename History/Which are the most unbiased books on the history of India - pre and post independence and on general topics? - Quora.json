            "answer_text": "I have not come across any , and frankly that is such a telling point. If you are a history professional, you may find Jadunath Sarkar to be an enlightening read , especially for ancient and medieval India. Unfortunately post-independence, history writing like much else got hijacked by the \u201cliberal\u201d left establishment. The stalwarts of this school were people like Romila Thapar and Bipin Chandra. Like the Freudians who would look for the hint of sex in every human interaction, the Left historians would try to shoe horn an economic narrative to all historical events. A couple of others like Irfan Habib and Mushirul Hassan also wrote in a similar style though I would not know if their approaches were more influenced by their professed Marxist ideologies or their religious affiliations.

            "answer_text": "There are many, but the book covering almost every aspect of History and answering many questions that we have in mind is that of Upinder Singh: A History of ancient and medieval India, from earliest times till 1200 AD. Buy A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: from the Stone Age to the 12th Century Book Online at Low Prices in India  Special features of the book are: 1. No bias whatsoever. She always presents both sides of the coin. 2. Comprehensive coverage- many books are guilty of covering only some aspects of History, and that too political for the most part. Singh, on the other hand, deals with politics, religion, philosophy, literature, culture, architecture, warfare, archeology and whatnot. 3. About 450 photographs in total. In no other place would one find these many photos. The comprehensive coverage and the lack of bias make her book very valuable, one of a kind. I highly recommend it. ",
