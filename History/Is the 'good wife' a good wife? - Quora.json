            "answer_text": "Mostly, yes. But also no. I think what they meant when they named this show was that this was a good wife because she'd stayed with her husband after a political sex scandal. A lot of people ask Alicia why she stayed. It's a very important question at the beginning. I think she stayed because of the kids, and that makes her a very good wife, but I do not think that's all of it. I think she also didn't want to divorce for that. It would have felt like a failure. For a long while, even though she doesn't divorce him, it's like she has because she really doesn't want to be married to him either. But she stays. However, in the course of the series, she's also unfaithful (although she only has sex when they're separated) and doesn't tell her husband about it. It's not just a short affair, there's a longing for another man that just goes on and on and on. But she does have mitigating circumstances, since he was unfaithful too, numerous time, and completely humiliated her in front of the whole country. So I think she's a great politician wife, and a great mother. He wouldn't be there without her. She's just not that good a wife once you've betrayed her. ",

            "answer_text": "To some point, Alicia is a good wife\u2014\u2014elegant and attractive in appearance, professional and talented in career, caring for kids, forbearing to husband. All these virtue makes her and Peter a well-suited couple, which can be an immensely positive weapon in the governor's election campaign. What makes her look not that good is her emotional entanglements. She went back and forth between 2 men, slept with her boss Will during her separation and kept a long-time secret relationship after her marriage got repaired. From the latest episode (S05, E10) we learn her sex fantasy towards Will still exists even they broke up thoroughly. This is the grey zone in human nature, like how do adults choose between sense and sensibility,  reality and romance, outside and inside, and how to make things right, or appear to be right when it goes rouge. It's not easy because each choice asks for great cost. While the complication reduces wife Alicia's \"good\" credits, it also adds realness to character Alicia. From this aspect, she is still good:) I think it's smart for a serial to pick a controversial name. As we arguing about it, the production team gains success for real. ",
