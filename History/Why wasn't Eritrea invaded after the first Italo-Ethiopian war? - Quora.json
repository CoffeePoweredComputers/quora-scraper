            "answer_text": "Because Ethiopia was in no condition to do so. Even after the Adwa defeat, many Italian outposts were still holding in Ethiopia, and Italy could ship more reiforcements to Eritrea. Ethiopia tried to seize Eritrea with the battle of Coatit at the beginning of the war, and they failed. Emperor Menelik knew that, after Adwa, the Italians were willing to accept Ethiopia independence, but not the loss of their oldest colony. Had he started the invasion, the Italians would have easily repelled the attack, causing so many losses that maybe they could have invaded Ethiopia again (this time successfully). The defeat at Adwa was caused by a big difference in numbers (17.000 Italians vs 100.000 Ethiopians) and equipment (the Ethiopians had modern rifles and machineguns provided by Russia; the Italians had to use older rifles, because the ammo stocked in Eritrea were not fit for the latest rifles). The Italian government would have avoided to make such a mistake again, sending a larger and properly equipped army. ",

            "answer_text": "Treason on Menelik's part. Fact is Italy was defeated, fact is Ethiopia had access to plenty of arms, fact is the Russian Empire was Ethiopia's ally and would supply Ethiopia with more arms if need be (many commanders at battle of Adwa were Russian). That being said Ras Alula begged Menelik for some horsemen to run the Italians out of Ethiopia once and for all. The so called Eritreans would have sided with Ras Alula and feed his men because he used to be their Ras or Duke. The real reason Menelik refused was because the northern regions of Ethiopia, so called Eritrea included, were competition for the throne. Menelik knew the Tigrinya speakers in the North were good fighters and chances are the capital would return to Northern Ethiopia after his death. In order to prevent this he left the so called Eritreans hanging.    ",
