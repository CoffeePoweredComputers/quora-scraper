            "answer_text": "The rightwing hates Jeff Bezos, Oprah Winfrey (gee, wonder why?), George Soros (alllllll day), Elon Musk, Tom Steyer, and now Mike Bloomberg. [Some also don\u2019t like Mark Cuban because of his Trump digs.] The left hates the Koch Brothers, Peter Thiel, Sheldon Adelson, Steve Wynn, Sam Walton\u2019s kids, and most other billionaires generally\u2014but especially banking, Big Pharma, fossil fuel, and insurance tycoons. Various people think Mark Zuckerberg is a creep, and are generally suspicious of the new Tech Titans. And even though you might think \u201cBill Gates\u201d because of his huge charity endeavors, different people aren\u2019t thrilled with his attacks on public schools, and a wealth tax. [Generally, billionaires who defend their massive wealth and hatred of taxes while promoting charities don\u2019t seem totally sincere.] Warren Buffet is quoted all the time. CNBC treats him like their George Washington and Jesus rolled into one. America certainly loves money, and Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is the most expensive stock in the world. Yet left-leaning people don\u2019t hate Buffet the way they do most banking or stock market titans because he\u2019s been open about the fact he pays very little in taxes. [Although if they really KNEW that apparently Buffett\u2019s private beliefs and what he\u2019s campaigned for are different than what he\u2019s said in public, they might feel different.] But I will say Steven Spielberg because he wasn\u2019t born to money. His business isn\u2019t creating monopolies (sorry, 1990s Bill Gates) or profiting off financial collapse (Buffett made 10 billion during the recession, because he was liquid while all his peers were having to take government bailouts or folding outright, had a chance to buy Lehman Brothers and would not do it) or poisoning the environment or putting out some horrible, chemicalized product that kills its consumers (junk food, cigarettes, made in China crap, etc.). Very few people have negative stories to say about him, and he\u2019s entertained audiences for decades. Sounds pretty respectable to me. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Bill Gates needs to be on that short list. Not only is he known for his extraordinary wealth and success, his vision and his philanthropic efforts put him at the top of the stack in my opinion. However, that would be based entirely on his past performance. The past is full of great men like Gates in American history. Your question asks me \u201cwho is the most respected\u201d Presently, Donald J Trump is the president of the United States. If he travels to cities across the country, his advance team can announce an appearance on short notice and draw 15, 20 or even 25 thousand people to an arena for the exclusive purpose of seeing and hearing him speak. Audiences have stood in the rain for hours for a glimpse of him. Sounds like respect to me. ",
