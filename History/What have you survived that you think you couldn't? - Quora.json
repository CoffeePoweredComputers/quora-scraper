            "answer_text": "I am still surviving finding my husband after he took his life in our home and it happened eight years ago. I didn't see his suicide coming and I carry a lot of guilt over his final decision. Bob and I were married over 31 years and we had an amazing relationship. We met when he was hired as the News Director at the television station I was working for as a reporter/anchor. Yes, he was my boss. We started as co-workers, became friends and eventually fell in love. We also co-anchored the news every night for many many years. When Bob took his life, I went through a police interrogation from Hell because I was, of course, a person of interest in his death. The police had to investigate, so at the worst moment in my life, I now had to answer incredibly personal questions about our relationship, our finances, our careers. Nothing was off limits. When the questions ended and other officers had searched every inch of our house, our cars and property line, it was determined Bob had killed himself. Now I had to start reaching out to family and close friends with the news. Those people, with the very best intentions, told me I couldn't tell anyone how Bob died. They said I would ruin his professional reputation. That made total sense to me so I kept the secret, for about a year. At that point, I realized I wasn't going to heal if I didn't try to make Bob's death matter\u2026so I started telling our story. I continue that practice to this day. I have no clue how to prevent suicide or Bob would still be alive. I do, however, know a lot about navigating the landfill survivors (those left behind following a suicide) have to travel. I also know that although the pain never goes away, life does go on. In fact recently I shared with my suicide support group, that I've actually fallen in love again. Steve knows all about Bob and instead of trying to make our marriage a distant memory, he asks questions about him and loves seeing his pictures. He incorporates Bob into our relationship. Most people never find an amazing lasting love once in their life. I have done it again and I will always be grateful. I also will never forget, Bob. Steve will see to that. ",

            "answer_text": "I was kidnapped. (Trigger warning. Lots of profanity and descriptions of violence) It was it was October 27th 2009. I was planning on staying home because I have never been one to celebrate Halloween. When I was a child we used to go to church during Halloween and my family always Associated Halloween with negative ideas of evil and witchcraft\u2026 so when I was 19 years old I had no plans of celebrating the holiday. I was in college and my friends insisted that I party with them. They told me it's all just superstitions and everything would be totally fine. My friend even bought me a nun outfit for my Halloween costume and she joked that the pure nature of the outfit would keep me safe from all the bad spirits or whatever it was that I was afraid of. Eventually I decided I was just being paranoid and everything would probably be fine\u2026 So we all went to this Halloween party and it was kind of fun but some very sketchy looking guys crashed the party and we we're frightened by them so we decided to leave. As we were leaving one of the guys from the party asked if we would give him a ride to a different party that was on the North side where all the rich people hang out. We we're both drinking and didn't feel comfortable driving but he swore that he was sober so we allowed him to drive everyone to this other party. At a first when we came in the host didn't like that we crashed the party but she got over it and everyone seemed pretty nice. They had a really big mansion with a jacuzzi in the backyard and a ton of alcohol. The place was packed. This random guy came up to me and asked me if I wanted to take shots with him and I declined because I don't take drinks from strangers\u2026 but he said \u201ccome on who comes to a party if they don't want to get fucked up?\u201d I decided that made sense. So I took this shot from him and that's the last solid memory that I really have for a few hours\u2026 the last thing I remember he was talking to me and being funny\u2026 then he told me that he left some drugs at his house and it would be fun to do them and invited me over. I don't leave parties with random guys and I wasn't really a big drug user so I declined. He gave me an angry look but quickly brushed it off and acted like everything was fine\u2026 I must have passed out or something because the next thing I remember was him carrying me and he was walking through the doorway of the house. As I woke up I jumped and I said \u201cwhere are you taking me?\u201d I started to panic but he hugged me close and said \u201ccalm down, everything is fine.\u201d I guess I must have blacked out again. The next thing I remember\u2026 whatever he dragged me with was strong it was like I didn't even have any thoughts. My eyes must have fallen open. I just remember seeing the top of the car and the window and the sky. It's the view you would see if you were laying on your back in the backseat of a car. I can't even remember if it was moving or not. I couldn't move or think or do anything I just remember that image\u2026 the next time I woke up I was in a house. They laid me across the couch and they were talking amongst themselves. As I started to wake up I overheard one guy sounding worried. He was saying things like where did you find her? The other guy sounded reassuring. He told him don't worry about it and nobody noticed anything. That's when I realized something strange was going on and I started to wake up. When I open my eyes I knew immediately that I was in a place I've never been. That scared me to death. I was looking around for a familiar face but it was just all these guys around me I didn't know any of them. I gasped. That's when everyone stop talking and looked at me. By the way they looked at me I knew exactly what was about to happen\u2026 the guy that was right next to me on the couch was the one who gave me the drink in the first place. he didn't say anything to he didn't say anything to me he just grabbed my thigh and pulled me to him. Then he super aggressively tried to shove his fist inside my body\u2026 I tried to stop him with my hands but he was so strong it was like I wasn't even doing anything. So I leaned back and kicked him right in the elbow joint to stop his hand. He pushed through my leg like it was nothing. So I put both feet up to my chest and I catapulted him off of me. He fell to the floor and that's when he lost his mind. He grabbed me by my throat and started shaking me screaming \u201cyou're going to pay for that you stupid bitch.\u201d he was shaking me back and forth so violently I couldn't think or do anything. I tried to pull his hands from around my throat but that just made him more angry. He threw me down onto the couch and started smashing my head into the couch over and over and over\u2026 I tried to dig my nails into his hands but I could barely do it because I couldn't breathe. That made him even more angry. He looked at me like really bitch? He stop slamming my head into the couch and started pushing me down into the couch. He put all his weight on my throat and was squeezing as tight as he could. I could feel his hand shaking. He was staring me deep into my eyes. His eyes were electric blue. He literally looked possessed while he was watching me suffocate. I didn't know what to do I wasn't able to scratch him or anything. Not being able to breathe me that so I could barely move any of my body. Besides he was on top of me. I decided to play dead and see if that would work. So I try to relax every muscle in my body. I tried as hard as I could to just let go of all of them all at once. To my surprise when I did that I actually was able to get a tiny bit of air. Apparently my throat was super flexed or something so when I relaxed it I was able to take a teeny breath. I used to say \u201csorry.\u201d He immediately let go of my throat. He said \u201cwhat did you say bitch?\u201d I started blubbering and crying and telling him I'm so sorry for kicking him I didn't mean to hurt him. I was just rambling on trying to figure out how the heck was going to get away. As I was apologizing I was slowly sitting up. I was trying to get in the bowing position sort of\u2026 because obviously that's a much better position to run than lying on your back. I kept telling him over and over how sorry I was and he was eating it up. Apparently he was in need of an ego stroke. I didn't know what else to say so I asked him if I could go pee. He lost his shit over that. He started screaming at me, \u201c what do you think I'm stupid? Fuck no you can't go pee . This is my house and I say what goes and you're not using my bathroom you understand?\u201d it was like he was having a freaking temper tantrum he was going crazy screaming at me about this. He was so mad and demanding an answer about whether or not I thought he was stupid. I told him I didn't know I just needed to use the bathroom. He said fuck no. I crossed my hands and sat forward on the couch and told him fine then I'll piss on your couch. Now I was in the perfect position to take off running and I was trying to pretend to be pissed off cuz he wouldn't let me pee. The front door was probably 20 or 30 feet away from this couch and there was a couch in front of me with like 4 guys on it so I knew I could never make it. As I was looking forward I made eye contact with one of the guys on the opposite couch. He was the only one that didn't look like he was enjoying himself. He looked like he couldn't decide if he wanted to throw up or faint. Apparently he didn't get the memo about this party being a kidnapping and gangrape party. When we made eye contact he's secretly pointed. For some reason that made me realize I could just run. So I ran the direction he was pointing because whatever was down the hallway was closer than the front door. The hallway was just behind the couch that was facing me he was on the end closest to the wall so I was able to run by. the guy with the crazy blue eyes lost his shit again. he started screaming asking if anybody helped me\u2026 he was freaking outraged. That is probably the only reason I made it to the bathroom\u2026 The bathroom was the first door on the right. I ran in and shut the door and locked it. He was right behind me I literally slammed the door in his face. He was screaming and punching the door demanding to know what I was doing in there. I told him I had to pee. That made him more angry. He said this is my house and these are my rules and if I say you can't pee then you can't. He was punching the door back and forth like a machine gun demanding I open it. I was staring at the door I could see it moving from his fist and I knew it was only a matter of time before he punches it down. So I leaned in front of the door to try to hold it together. His punches were hurting so bad through the door I could only imagine how it would feel once he got through. Then he said fine you stupid bitch. If you won't come out I'm coming in. He body slammed the door\u2026 it opened about an inch and I could see his blue eyes staring at me in the mirror. He looked like a freaking demon or something. I was so scared I couldn't breathe. I felt like I was going to throw up. I was trying to think of what to do but I didn't know what to do so I just press my body against the door as hard as I could. He was looking like he wanted to reach in but decided against it. When he went back in the door shut I started praying. I said I got I know I'm not any more special than any of these other girls who have been murdered but please do something for me please help me. Right at that moment I remembered the part of the Bible that says God does not interfere with the Free Will of men. That made me feel completely and totally hopeless like there was no point to continue trying. There was at least seven guys in that living room besides this one that was trying to break the door down. I knew there was no way I would ever get away from them. I decided if I was going to die I don't want to die like a coward hiding behind a door. So I moved out of the way of the door. I decided when he came through I was just going to fight as hard as I could and hopefully he would accidentally kill me and I wouldn't have to deal with the other plans they might have for me. Well he wasn't expecting that I guess\u2026 when he bought his on the door he literally flew through it. The door flew off the hinges. The door frame exploded. He tumbled together side of the bathroom and when he looked up at me with those terrifying blue eyes I took off running down the hallway. Luckily they didn't hear me coming and everyone was still sitting on the couches when I ran by. He shouted, \u201c she's getting away!\u201d! But it was too late I was already running for the front door. I didn't look back I didn't want to slow myself down. These guys didn't even lock the door. So I ran straight out. Just as I was running off the porch a different guy snatched me right out of the air. He put his arms around my waist and I could tell He was much stronger than the other guy. I started scratching his arms as hard as I could. He threw me onto the pavement and then grabbed me and wrapped his arms around my arms so I couldn't scratch him. He started trying to drag me back in the house and I planted my feet into the concrete as hard as I could. For some crazy reason he didn't want to drag my feet so he kept trying to lift me off the ground. A second guy came outside and asked what was taking so long. He said you could help me rather than standing their talkingshit. The second guy came down the porch stairs and try to grab my ankles but as soon as he got close enough I pick my feet up and started trying to kick him in the face. We kept going back and forth between this. Every time I picked up my feet guy number one started walking towards the house. Every time I planted them back in the ground guy number two started trying to grab my ankles. I started screaming every crazy that I could think of. I told him I was going to come back and haunt them. I told them that they were going to find themselves in the insane asylum because every time they open their eyes I will be there. I would never let them forget what they did. I told him I was going to claw their face off while they were raping me\u2026 and once I was dead I was going to waste my entire afterlife haunting each and every one of them until they join me in the grave. To my utter astonishment this thing to actually work. A third guy came out and demanded they shut me up. The first guy said \u201cthis bitch is crazy I'm not letting go of her hands!\u201d and the third guy started spazzing out. He was like if you don't shut her up at someone's going to call the cops. Someone's going to look out the window and see the three of us trying to drag her into the house kicking and screaming and someone's bound to call the cops. He said I can't go back to prison you don't know what they do to Guys Like Us in prison. You don't know what it's like. The more that he talked the worst his panic attack got. Finally he was like fuck it guys let's just let her go. Guy number one was like fuck no!\u2026maybe someone called the cops but they probably didn't but if we let her go there's a 100% chance that she's going to call the cops. She's already seen our faces and she knows where we live. We can't let her go\u2026 Guy number 3 said, \u201ccome on man, look at her\u2026 she's so fucked up she can barely stand. She probably won't even remember anything when she wakes up tomorrow. She has no idea where in the world she is and she's terrified\u2026\u201d He looked me in the eye and said, \u201c I bet if we let her go she'll just run and never look back. She'll just run and run and run until she gets far enough away that she feels safe and then she'll never be able to figure out how to get back to this house\u2026\u201d I didn't say anything but in my heart I was trying to tell him that that's exactly what I would do. If they let me go I swear I would never say anything to anyone I would just run away and never look back\u2026 guy number one pause for a while and then he slowly let go of my arms. As he did I pushed out of his grasp and ran\u2026 and I didn't look back. I didn't leave bread crumbs because I didn't want them to find me. I just got out of there\u2026 I cannot believe I survived that. ",
