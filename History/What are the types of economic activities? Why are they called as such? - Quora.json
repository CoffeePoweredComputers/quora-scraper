            "answer_text": "If I consume an ice cream cone, that is economic activity.If I am a chef and I produce a pastry, THAT is economic activity.When truckers take produce from market gardens to cities, economic activity. But in practice, that is, statistically (in the real world, empirically), it is NOT OBVIOUS what constitutes economic activity. A professional economist wants to use the highest quality estimates and he would not compare apples and oranges? If you want to, you might reference the gross domestic product (GDP), with a grain of salt, mind you, as \"some measure\" of economic activity a \"number,\" sort of makes it easier to understand, but economic activity is not GDP. The traditional definition of economic activity is \"the consumption, production or distribution of ECONOMIC GOODS.\" But, when someone gives me a definition, I look for exceptions. Science says traditional definitions should be tested. PROBLEMS: What are ECONOMIC GOODS?: \"(They are) things that can have a price when sold in the market.\" The traditional definition sometimes refers to \"commodities\" (raw materials like cotton or coffee). It seems as if \"market\" should be written like this: MARKET. But what about the black market? I happen to know how big this can be \"people-wise,\" especially in developing states that I lived in. (I will not name these because I appreciated my host countries and I may want to return some day.) I only have a sense of the size of the black market in Western countries, which is MUCH larger in dollar volume of course, because it is based on the FINANCIAL sector, i.e., interest rate schemes, insurance fraud, illegal banking activities, insider trading on Wall Street, numbered bank accounts residing offshore, and the huge one: corporate influence peddling. Changes in financial assets aren't recorded in GDP, and there's the rub. So we ARE talking about apples and oranges. Think about what this means when it comes to international comparison. It's obvious - if you know anything about arithmetic - you compare countries only if they have the exact same level of black market activity - otherwise you have to weight them differently. And the size of the black market (people and dollar) is only ONE FACTOR for standardization - you need ALL the research weight variables of interest to be standardized - to compare GDP across countries. Resist the religion of the multi-lateral agencies, all the millions of dollars wasted in paper publications excoriating the poor for weak markets; old hardcopy is sequestered carbon; new computer bytes are esoteric and as important as ether. You produce a classical symphony that premiers in Baltimore on May 3, 2001. The market production value of this is placed in category called \"Arts and Entertainment\" and is part of an Economic Census (every 5 years). Lots of other orchestras pay for the rights to re-play your symphony, so how could the assets be amortized? their values are appreciating! Oh, wait, now depreciating because the Orlando Symphony got a bad review! What have we missed? Even initial development expenditures go unrecorded; it is IMPOSSIBLE to determine definitions and specifications of what is a final good/commodity/service. Truth is elusive in Economics. That doesn't mean you have to lie. What about that laptop you bought for $670.00 in 2008 and sold for $200.00 in 2006? The $200.00 will not be measured in current GDP because the laptop was only produced one time, so you don't want to count it as produced a second time! The laptop depreciated in value by $470.00. Trying to make such an estimate for the inventory of capital in GENERAL (in an economy) is a dead end street. (Why am I even wasting time repeating myself?) Goods classification, depreciation rate change, the length of time a capital good is being used, and a host of other matters mess up the rule that we should measure production only once. Do we need structural engineers to prove that a bridge has not been consumed by the elements and is still servicing traffic? Oh, and also don't measure \"intermediate goods\" - those things that go into producing final goods which are what you really want. Oh, and also when it comes to services, make sure you measure final services or the final distribution of service or the service of final distribution. Anyway, measure services! You throw up your hands and leave. It's the same concept with our flesh and blood. The government pays money to social security so that you won't become a cost burden to society as your human capital depreciates. Social security payments are not in GDP. We don't want to count the production of a human being twice, and that's why things like welfare payments (effectively maintenance) aren't included in GDP. So, we stick with the program there. What about my dear spouse who washes our dishes by hand at home? Is that not economic activity? Yet I can buy a dishwasher at Home Depot and that final consumption expenditure $314.00 goes directly to GDP. What about the destruction of environmental assets, such as when a landowner decides to cut down all his trees and increases the temperature of the micro-climate around his land so much that all his neighbors have to buy air conditioners. When an \"owner of private assets\" does something that hurts a lot of public citizens, what kind of an economic activity is that? How should we record it? LOOK: in an attempt to understand what something really MEANS, like economic activity, sometimes you realize how much you're missing, and it makes the overall exercise pointless. Then it's time to throw out the baby with the bath water and RETOOL. Theory is not standing up to reason. This has been debated for the last decade at least - we need a New Economics of Reality. First thing YOU can do, gentle reader, and my honest opinion, is throw away that expensive Macroeconomics theory book - MOST of it is useless. Or should we just say screw this: why are we wasting our time counting losses in one column and gains in another. Let's change the definition of \"economic activity.\" ",
