            "answer_text": "In that case, you have to understand that, Japanese Empire was fighting two different Russias. And they were not the same Russia, by any course. Russo-Japanese War: the Imperial Russia was too relying over confident and were in un-prepared condition. Russia, those days, believed on the fact that Russia would soon occupy Korea and reached Beijing, and a little tiny Japan would never dare to fight Russia. So Japan decided to make up a sudden attack. They launched an attack on the Port Arthur then later declared war. It blew Russia so much.In all entire of the war, due to underestimating the Japanese advances, Russian force was ill-prepared. So Japanese massive attacks caused Russian troops to abandon even they caused many casualties. Although the Japanese suffered a higher casualties than usual, comparing to the casualties war with Qing China, however, Russia failed to win any decisive battle to turn over the war.Also, the Russian Navy was ill-prepared as well. Too confident and overestimating itself, they didn\u2019t modernize unlike the Japanese. Tsushima was the blow up of the Russian power.Japan also had more hesitate on defending its colonial desire. Unlike Russia was just sitting there to hope, Japan prepared for Korea more and more.Soviet-Japanese War: Japan was on the desire to wage war. However, Japan was fighting in two fronts. Japan was fighting China, even KMT China was busy on fighting the Communists; and the others, was the Soviet. They couldn\u2019t afford to handle all.Soviet force, those days, had been modernizing crazy. Even those days, Stalin was crazy, but the Soviet military was not a kind of joking military. Like User-13474176948971349891 mentioned, Russia was working with German Nazi on developing its military as well. German doctrines were adopted for the Russian force. And the Soviet army was ready to fight.Japanese force, simply, made the same mistake that Russian force did at 1904. Japanese force too underestimated the Russian Soviet troops, using the 1904\u201305 experience, without knowledge of the Soviet military modernization.So when the Japanese force attacked the Soviet, the Soviet quickly deployed tanks and heavy armored weapons. And this totally smashed the Japanese force into piece and piece. This time, the Russian casualties were lower comparing to the enemy from the East. Khalkhin Gol for example. Japanese troops waited the Russians. Of course we brought up tanks to them. They fought us. Crazy. But when they\u2019re out of resource, we could still bring the other brigade. So they lost.Japan used only one tactics to fight Russia in both two wars. So I think they had failed to realize that Imperial Russia and Soviet Russia were two very different kind of Russia. One was too overestimating themselves; one was waiting the Japanese already. So they fought but it came with different results. Khalkin Gol exposed the weakness of the Japanese force, exactly how Tsushima exposed the weakness of Russia.  And you know the funniest? In 1945, the Soviet finally returned to attack the Japanese. And the Japanese still made that old mistake again, the mistake happened in Khalkhin Gol. It does explain a lot ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some big picture reasons. A. The Russo-Japanese War, although fought over Korea and Manchuria, was to a large degree a naval war. The Japanese Navy was well trained, near home waters, and able to efficiently and rapidly concentrate its forces. The Russian Navy, meanwhile, was divided between the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Pacific. This enabled the Japanese Navy to divide and conquer. The Japanese destroyed much of the Russian Pacific Fleet at Port Arthur. Following this, much of the remaining strength of the Russian Navy was ambushed and wiped out at Tsushima following an exhausting voyage from Europe around Africa and through the Indian Ocean. Khalkhin Gol, however, was in the interior of Asia which played to Soviet strengths and Japanese weaknesses (more on this below). B. In 1905, Russia was only in the early stages of industrialization, while Japanese industrialization was proceeding rapidly. In 1939, however, the Soviet Union had just gone through a crash industrialization which had made Soviet industrial output second only to that of the U.S. in the world. On top of that, the Soviets had an enormous base of natural resources to feed their industries. Japanese industrial progress, however, had stalled due to a lack of natural resources (which is why they along with their Nazi allies in Germany were so eager to expand and conquer). C. In 1939, Japan was a naval power and the Soviet Union was a continental power. The Japanese Army was mostly infantry and was designed to fight isolated colonial armies as well as the ill-equipped armies of China. The Red Army was, however, a heavy and well-supplied continental force. Khalkhin Gol was in the interior of Asia and relatively far away from the ocean, which gave the continental power the advantage here. However, it should be mentioned that at this time the Red Army as a whole was not necessarily better than the Japanese Army. The factors I mention above were more of a reflection of the then potential of the Red Army vs. the Japanese Army (which would later play out for real in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945). The Red Army at this time was reeling from Stalin\u2019s purges which had killed off about half of its officer corps. This was also a border battle and not a full scale war. The year before there had been another border clash between the Soviet Union and Japan. In that battle, the Japanese Army generally outfought the Red Army before withdrawing. The performance of the Red Army at Khalkhin Gol was an anomaly in what was otherwise a large but poorly prepared army at this time. Later that year the Red Army would be humiliated by Finland in the Winter War. That was far more indicative of the overall condition of the Red Army in 1939 (a fact duly noted by Hitler) than Khalkhin Gol was. It just so happened that at Khalkhin Gol in 1939 the Japanese faced the best soldiers and best commander (General Zhukov) in the Red Army, and this battle ended up being a prelude of things to come. Those same troops would save Moscow in December 1941 (after much of the rest of the Red Army had been annihilated); and Zhukov would command the counterattack at Stalingrad that turned the tide of the war. Zhukov used the same basic tactics at Stalingrad that he used at Khalkhin Gol. ",
