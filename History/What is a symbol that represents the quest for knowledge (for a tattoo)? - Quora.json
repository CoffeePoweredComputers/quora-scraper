Since knowledge is power and since true Satanism advocates self empowerment than it only makes sense that I would choose this symbol. And I actually do have this symbol tattooed on my left arm. For you it must be a symbol that you feel best represents the same. However I discourage you from choosing the cross or crucifix as these symbols tend to advocate blind faith over knowledge. Although I do laugh at the irony of getting a cross or crucifix tattoo when the bible strictly forbids them. The choice is yours though. ",
