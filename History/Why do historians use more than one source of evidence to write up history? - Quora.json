            "answer_text": "My Ph.D. dissertation concerns a military mutiny that occurred in India in 1806. It\u2019s available here: Men Without Hats: Dialogue, Discipline... book by James W. Hoover. A lot of my dissertation deals with precisely this issue of multiple points of view. In my dissertation, I describe how two soldiers, standing in adjoining sentry boxes, give completely different accounts of what they saw, even though they were viewing the same events from the same location. Both primary sources, but very different. The thing is, people aren\u2019t machines; we simply don\u2019t experience things in the same way. First of all, we have our own ideas, prejudices, understandings, etc. Then, when we begin to tell the tale, we make choices about what words to use, what to emphasize, what to leave out. Imagine something happens in China - say, a car accident. A Chinese witness who understands what everyone\u2019s saying will offer a very different view than a foreigner who just arrived and doesn\u2019t even know what traffic laws are in China. Now, imagine other situations. Say, you\u2019re writing about an international negotiation. Primary sources from both the Israeli and Palestinian points of view will give a clearer picture of what went down. You can also compare them for omissions, differences, etc. Likewise, a battle makes more sense if you know what the commanders on both sides were thinking. Often, unfortunately we don\u2019t. Multiple primary sources can also give depth and nuance. Roosevelt launches the New Deal, but you can get more understanding from a Republican congressman who didn\u2019t want it, and from a Southern farmer who benefited in the long run from the President\u2019s reforms. Being able to reference multiple primary sources makes history more interesting, reveals questions and problems, and also contributes to making history more accurate. This is one of the reasons why we place such a high value, in history, on finding new historical sources. The general public probably thinks that everything has been published, etc., but trust me, we are just scratching the surface of everything that is squirreled away in historical archives. And new materials surface constantly. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a couple of reasons: It\u2019s good to have a second opinion. Individual sources may have been biased, misinformed, or under political or social pressure to come to a particular conclusion. Consensus doesn\u2019t guarantee accuracy, but it does inspire confidence.Sometimes sources disagree. In these cases, responsible historians will be upfront about the disagreement and, if they pick a side, explain why they find one source more credible than the other.",
