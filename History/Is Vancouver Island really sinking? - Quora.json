And as far as \u201cthe big on goes\u201d on average over the millennia they have averaged 500 years between\u2026 Last on in 1700 - that means on average the next one is in 2200. But only mother nature knows for sure. What is overdue is the southern half of the fault off Oregon - it pops twice as often on average - every 250 years - so the southern half is overdue, not the whole complete fault. When it does strike Vancouver Island will drop about a metre or two on the west coast of the island. The 9.x epicenter will be over 100 km off the west coast of the island and it will be felt in the populated areas on the east coast as about a 5.x to 7.x depending on geography and distance. It will also last for minutes rather than seconds. Tsunami will hit the west coast of the island only and part way down the Straight of Juan de Fuca \u2026 Hint\u2026 a long violent shaking is your official signal to get the heck to high ground ! ! ! ! You might have 20 minutes\u2026 ",

Apparently the next BIG one is \u2018due\u2019 any time in the next minute to 100+ years.
