            "answer_text": "I'd give it a few years more, but the long term outlook, if they can open up working trade with the US, and drop the elements of socialism that are holding them back, very promising.  They were once the leading nation in the Caribbean and could be again. They could make a lot of money with medical tourism.  Cuba has a surplus of doctors and nurses, but their medical infrastructure and supply system is (unless you are a high ranking party member, visiting American \"progressive\", etc) somewhere between \"decrepit\" and \"medieval\".   But... they are sitting only a short distance from the world's greatest medical market.  Florida.  Cubans could pump up their economy by opening up low cost long term care and rehab centers focused on the massive elderly patient pool right next door.  They would likely have to work closely with American health care networks, get various approvals from the US government, and like China, quietly sweep the idea of \"socialism\" under the rug.  But it could work.   The first venture that does this will be a high risk high return thing, and if it works people will make a lot of money- in the US and in Cuba.  If it works it will open the gates. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think it is possible to invest in Cuba right now.  Any money you put into that country would be more like gambling than investing. To properly invest money I believe it is important to understand the economy of the country involved and the business environment there.  It is also crucial to understand the business accounting practices and regulatory environment that insures business reports are accurate and consistent with those practices.  None of these things apply favorably to Cuba today. Cuba is one of the last of the pure Communist countries.  There is no such thing as private industry - any industry belongs to the government.  Even if the economy moves toward capitalism where it is even possible to invest there is no history of any of the companies which might emerge. So my personal answer is Cuba is not a promising country for investments.  For that level of pure gambling I'd rather go to Las Vegas and play poker.  At least that way I get to eat some good food.
