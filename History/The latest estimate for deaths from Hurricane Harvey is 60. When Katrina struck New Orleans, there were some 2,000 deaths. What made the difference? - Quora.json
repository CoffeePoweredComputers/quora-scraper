            "answer_text": "First of all, it is important to realize that, many of the precautions, procedures, protocols and various other emergency response directives that were active in Houston AT THE TIME OF HARVEY, were in place BECAUSE of Katrina and what was learned during Katrina. Also, remember that while Houston is HUGE in terms of area, and New Orleans is basically a small city in what amounts to a bowl, Houston is about 80 feet above seal level. This means that, technically it is a large plateau above sea level where water WILL ultimately, automatically, eventually run off , whereas water in New Orleans had/has to be physically PUMPED out of the city. Water not only stood for weeks and weeks, but it rose dramatically even after the actual storm and levee breach. Some areas had as much as 18 feet of water. Houston\u2019s flooding, although horrific, did not reach levels where as many people drowned or were trapped on their roofs or in their attics (with no way out to the roof from the attic). The population in New Orleans at the time of Katrina consisted of a large group of people who had NEVER actually been through a serious, serious hurricane. The last REALLY bad hurricane was Camille, which was in 1969 (I was 9). As a result, all the storms many of the people here had ever experienced turned out to be nothing but a bad rainstorm. They thought Katrina would be another of the same, and decided to stay. Incidentally, the last REALLY bad storm before Camille was in 1965, and many of the residents here at the time of THAT storm, Betsy, were with either infants, or already passed away. Believe me, those people would have left. Even though the City of New Orleans attempted every effort to provide transportation for anyone who wanted to leave, a good portion of the population here is fairly poor. Many did not have cars and could not afford transportation out of the city, much less a place to stay. So\u2026 they stayed. The flooding from the levee break was completely unexpected. The day after Katrina was a beautiful, bright, sunshiny morning. Suddenly, we were told that the levee had broken and water was pouring in to the city. We watched on TV as the emergency crews tried desperately to block off the broken levee by dropping HUGE containers (shipping containers) into the the breach, with no result at all). There was no real warning that a HUGE flood was coming. I remember, watching a small trickle, nearly 11 miles from where the breach was, thinking that it would never reach where I was in the Central City area. I, like so many others, was very wrong. The water was coming up (Yes, I measured it) at a rate of about 6 inches every fifteen minutes or so. Point is that, the flooding was not caused (necessarily) by the storm, and caught everyone in the city, who thought they had survived it virtually unscathed, by complete surprise. A very important point I want to mention here is one that many who weren\u2019t here during Katrina don\u2019t know: About 20 minutes after Katrina hit, the police radio went out. TOTALLY OUT. The police had no way to communicate with each other. Nearly ALL cellphones went completely out. It was nearly impossible to find a working telephone. it was almost like a nuclear event where you didn\u2019t know if you were the only person left. Nothing was open. There was nowhere to get much of anything. The streets were deserted. Women were non-existent because it was like the wild, wild west. There was no electricity, ANYWHERE, and it was hot as hell. It was so dark outside in the streets, that you literally couldn\u2019t see your hand. Lots of weird (and scary noises though). Natural gas lines spewing gas out (dangerous!). That doesn\u2019t appear to be the case in Houston (as I mentioned earlier, much was learned from Katrina about how NOT to do things). Another interesting point is that, the local government had just recently built a HUGE pumping station at what is know here as the railroad overpass on I-10 westbound. It was supposed to keep I-10 under the overpass clear. The pump motors were way up high, so as to NEVER be flooded. Unfortunately, the admin decided to put the pump motors down ON the pumps (which ended up being under water) to save several million dollars. When asked about it, they admin replied that they wouldn\u2019t have activated them anyway, because\u2026 guess what? They would have been pumping the water directly to the canal where the levee breach was instead of directly to Lake Pontchartrain! Can you say, STUPE?!? In finishing here, I want to say that, I have NOTHING bad to say about Houston and the gracious people there. They took us in, helped us, and gave their ALL for us when we needed it most. I wish people would stop comparing these two storms. I saw bodies floating in the water, idiots dragging ATM\u2019s down the street behind their pickup trucks, and so much more horrific, stupid stuff. Please, help Houston if you can. They deserve and need our help. ",

            "answer_text": "While I can't give you all the answers to this very complicated question, I will try to list a few which I consider to be crucial, based on my own experiences with Katrina, basic knowledge of the Houston area, and recent news reports concerning Harvey's impact: The flood waters caused by Harvey were not as high, came up gradually, and were generally expected and predictable. Remember, most of the flooding in New Orleans was caused by storm surges and levee breaches. These events were typically unexpected, and caused rapid flash-flooding, which some people (especially the sick and the elderly) simply could not escape.Many parts of New Orleans are below sea level, which resulted in slow or non-existent flood water drainage once the storm was over. Portions of the city were underwater for weeks, not days. This caused shortages in basic supplies, and hampered rescue efforts, as well.The population of New Orleans is much more densely-packed, with far less \u201csuburban sprawl\u201d than Houston is known for. In areas where populations are more concentrated, even isolated flooding and hurricane damage can cause significant numbers of injuries and deaths \u2014 simply because there are more people within the affected area.Most of the responsible governmental agencies (federal, state, and local) were woefully unprepared for Hurricane Katrina \u2014 and despite countless heroic deeds performed on an individual basis, there was far less coordination and cooperation among private and public rescue personnel. Many hard lessons were learned back in 2005, and thank God we saw a much more focused and effective response to all the damage and devastation this time around.",
