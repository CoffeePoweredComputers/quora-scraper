When someone is in a coma, they\u2019re still breathing or are able to be mechanically supported on a ventilator, and have a heartbeat. In death, there is no breathing or heartbeat. Nurses can pronounce death, and the usual policy is for two nurses to each separately assess for breathing and a heartbeat. ",

Note:When brain death is suspected a protocol is started involving, amongst other things, putting ice cold water in the auditory canal with a syringe to elicit a reflex and performing an EEG (it must be iso-electric in case of brain death).
