            "answer_text": "Hi, Elfa Reversa. Eleesha Faye makes worthy comments. I am not quite sure myself what you are asking. Are you wondering what was going on in the western world generally between about 500 and 1300 CE? Is there a particular kind of medieval art that interests you? In some ways, one of the best introductions to medieval art is Meetings With Remarkable Manuscripts: Twelve Journeys into the Medieval World (2017) by Christopher de Hamel. Each chapter is about a different manuscript and Christopher has a delightful writing style that connects all kinds of information as well as providing an introduction to remarkable libraries all over the world. In art history we break medieval art up into sections: early medieval which starts in the earliest years of the Christian era and continues into the 8th or 9th century. The Byzantine era which starts with the separating of the Roman empire into an Eastern and Western Empire. So that\u2019s about the 4th or 5th century up through, usefully, the 13th or 14th century and the fall of Jerusalem to the Muslim armies. Romanesque, which generally describes architecture and sculpture is about the 9th to the 11th century and Gothic picks up around the 12th century. It does matter where you locate yourself geographically. Artistic styles and architectural developments vary widely. ",

            "answer_text": "Not sure how to answer this question. There are broad starting & stopping points to medieval art, but it covers a lot of ground both in actual geography & in time. Not every country/region adopted new styles at the same time. Early Christian art slowly developed into the Romanesque style around 1000. That heavy rounded style became the lighter, higher, pointier Gothic style about 1200. The Renaissance which is greatly different than the 3 preceding styles is still considered medieval. It ranges from 1300 - 1600. The Northern Renaissance started later than the Italian. Since there was no mass communication or easy travel back then ideas spread only about as fast as a man or horse could walk. The following Mannerism & early Baroque was probably going on as some artists in the hinterland got the hang of the Renaissance. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of it can depend on which part of Europe you\u2019re interested in. The Byzantine era is one of the more notable ones though- most artists were paid by commission through the church to create religious paintings, such as frescoes and mosaics. Most art was created either for the church or for the wealthy, who could hire painters to capture their likenesses. Later on still lives and memento mori\u2019s became quite popular in the household. There were some works that were actually an amalgamation of the two- a bowl of dying fruit surrounded by flies and dried flowers to remind us that no one, not even the eternal still lives of fruit, are safe from death.
