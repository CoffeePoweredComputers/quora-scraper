            "answer_text": "My reply is from the point of view of the Indian markets. Bonds or debentures are traded both on the BSE and the NSE. In retail lots upto Rs 10 lakhs, they are traded in the CM (Capital Market) segment on NSE and the F Group on BSE. You can see the scrip wise code and quotes for these debentures and buy and sell accordingly. However trading is fairly low, as most investors prefer to hold debentures till maturity. For lots above Rs 10 lakhs, debentures and bonds are traded in the WDM (Wholesale Debt Market) of both BSE & NSE. Bonds are traded in the Corporate Bond segment, while on BSE there is the ICDM (Indian Corporate Debt Market). The trading is based on negotiated deals, not the retail screen based quote style of trading. There is much more trading in this segment compared to the retail investors. In addition to debentures, government securities can be traded in the retail and wholesale segments of BSE & NSE. ",

            "answer_text": "Debentures are bonds, not stocks. Normally, bonds are bought and sold in lots of 100 OTC by investment banks. Most participants in the bond market are institutional investors. Retail investors sometimes buy fewer than 100 shares through the retail division. These are called Odd Lots. The NYSE does have a trading room where they trade odd lots of bonds. So, technically, the answer is yes. But it is such a small percentage of trading, that the general answer is No. ",
