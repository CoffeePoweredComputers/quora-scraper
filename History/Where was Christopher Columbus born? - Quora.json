            "answer_text": "History books say Columbus was born somewhere near Genoa (Italy) in 1451, but there also said that he was Jewish, Aragonese, Galician, Majorcan, or from La Mancha. Adding to the confusion, in recent published books this last decades they sugested that Col\u00f3n was even a woman. It is paradoxical that we know so little about such an important character. Today, several Spanish regions dispute his origins. All we know for sure is that he have being sailing since the age of 18, knew well the Atlantic, from Iceland to Guinea, and wrecked in Portugal in 1476, where he married at least once and had a vague offspring. Colombo, Col\u00f3n, Colom and Colonne are some of the names associated with the \"discovering\" of America. For over 500 years, there have been various theories that make him native of Genoa, Savona, Milan, Corsica, Galicien, Portugal, Castile, Greece and even Norway. Some place the birthplace of Columbus in different parts of Catalonia, Mallorca and even Ibiza also disputed. That is, the great navigator is the man most disputed in history. However, he could be born only in one place. Which one was it? It\u00b4s still a mystery although it may soon we\u00b4ll categorically establish his origin, if we are lucky. September last year in Seville, the remains of Diego Col\u00f3n (his brother) were exhumed (the rests remained in the premises of the factory in Seville, La Cartuja-Pickmann). Although it seems that the bones of Diego Columbus are very deteriorated, researchers want to compare their nuclear DNA with the discoveret and those of his son Hernando Columbus, buried in the Cathedral of Seville. So Seville also competes with the famous Columbus Lighthouse in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, as being the last home of the discoverer.The tests will determine precisely the truly Columbus, and may confirm if the admiral was a bastard son of the Prince of Viana, and clarify once and for all whether his origin is Portuguese, Mallorcan, Catalan or Galician and not \u201cGenov\u00e9s\u201d as the official biography pretends.

            "answer_text": "The document that has supported Christopher Columbus as being born in Genoa, a will supposedly written by his own hand, is now known to be fake. There are serious historical flaws in the will, like referring to the Prince John (son of Isabella and Ferdinand) as being alive when he was actually deceased for almost two years. Although it is still a mystery, a thorough investigation as shown that all evidences seems to point to Christopher Columbus as being born in Portugal, from a family deeply related to the portuguese royalty. Cuba, in Alentejo, Portugal, is pointed out as one of the plausible places where he might have been born. It has been proven that his mother tongue was portuguese.

            "answer_text": "Columbus, or Colon as we call him in Spanish, was born in Genoa. Since Italy did not exist as a nation in the fifteenth century he was not born in Italy. In fact, Columbus was every bit as Castilian as I am. He spent most of his life in Spain, everything written by him that has survived was written in Spanish, and he considered himself a true son of Castile until the day he died. Claiming Columbus for Italy is like saying General Dwight Eisenhower was German.  ",

History tells us that he was a half-Jewish Italian, who was able to talk the King and Queen of Spain into supporting his mission, which was to find a sea passage to the Far East, by sailing to the west, from Spain. He never set foot in the continental USA. The closest he came was to sail around, and make port in several of the islands we know today as \u201cThe Caribbean\u201d.
