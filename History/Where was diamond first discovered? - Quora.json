            "answer_text": "Golconda, India, about 4,000 years ago. The modern diamond industry traces its roots to South Africa, where in 1869 a small boy found a shiny rock that he used in a game similar to what Americans call jacks. A friend noticed the stone, took it to a specialist, and learned it was a 21.25-carat rough diamond. That kicked off a diamond rush, centered around the Kimberley Mine in the Northern Cape of South Africa. Unlike Golconda, Kimberley produced so many diamonds that for the first time they became available not only to kings and maharajahs, but also to \u201cordinary\u201d wealthy people. It is said this was the beginning of the democratization of diamonds. Today the world\u2019s largest producers of diamonds are Botswana and Russia. But the majority of consumers still think of diamonds as coming from South Africa. ",

            "answer_text": "Diamonds are found in many parts of the world. South Africa, Russia and India have the most productive diamond mines, but they are found elsewhere in smaller quantities. Canada produces some diamonds and there is an open surface site in Arkansas, USA, where people can pay a small fee and look for them and keep whatever they find. Some surprisingly large stones have been found there. ",
