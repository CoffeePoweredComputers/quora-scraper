            "answer_text": "I am not Brazilian, as you can see by my name, but am American born and Portuguese naturalized.  Having lived in both countries for a total of forty years (twenty and twenty), and being married to a Brazilian, this is a question that often goes through my mind.  When we lived in Brasilia, in the seventies and eighties, there was almost zero contact with Portugal.  In a city of one million there was one Portuguese restaurant (looking now I found at least seven).  I personally never heard Portuguese as spoken in Portugal, never saw a Portuguese movie, watched a Portuguese TV show, or heard a Portuguese musical group.  Today I am sure it has changed a little although I think the average Brazilian has no concept of life in Portugal.  Even today there are no Portuguese musical groups popular in Brazil and definitely no Portuguese films known by the public.  Most Brazilians, who have any opinion at all, and we are talking about educated people living in cities with access to internet and who read, still consider Portugal to be a rather old-fashioned, traditional, mono-cultural people with an unintelligible way of speaking.  Few Brazilian are aware of the state of the art expressways, the advanced telephone and internet system, the gigantic hypermarkets and shopping centers etc.  Portugal underwent a radical transformation in the nineties with EU money and left Brazil behind in many ways.  As far as the Portuguese jokes are concerned, my theory is that they are based on the typical Portuguese immigrant who arrived in the fifties and sixties from Tras-os-Montes, who was usually illiterate, had a moustache (often men and women), dressed poorly in sombre colours, often wore tamancos (wooden clogs), had poor personal hygiene, and worked in lowly professions such as itinerant vendor, butcher, barkeeper,  or baker.  They stood out in Brazil and were often laughed at until soon many of them became quite rich, having saved and saved, often sleeping on boards in their shops.  Soon they were the bosses and the natives were their employees. One aspect of the Portuguese I noticed coming from Brazil was their literal-mindedness and their inability to think outside the box.  My first shock was how Brazilian humor fell flat on the listeners.  There was little awareness of language play or criticism of the powers that be.  There was, and there still is, a reverence for power and those who have a degree.  Someone who has finished university is called a Doctor, and not doing so might even cause serious problems for the interlocutor.  Even a politician like Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, indicted for corruption and sitting in a jail cell, is called Sr. Engineer, even though his degree was fraudulently obtained.   A final point to be mentioned to show the cultural differences is the Portuguese negativity.  The Portuguese complain a lot, usually doing nothing about it.  While a Brazilian will respond to the question \"Como vai\"? with \"Tudo bem\" or \"Muito bem\" a typical Portuguese response is \"Vou andando\" (lit. I am walking).  Common expressions are \"\u00c9 a vida\" and \"Tem que ser\".   There is a fatalism reflected in the language.  That you do not see in Brazil. ",

            "answer_text": "Portugal suffers a huge inferiority complex when compares itself with other European countries. However, I have felt that some portuguese tried (with no success) to throw their weight against Brazilians. \u201cWe are europeans, therefore, we are better than Brazil\u201d However, Brazilians in general feel superior to Portuguese too (In fact, we feel superior to Spanish as well). Partially because we all know that Brazil is the only country in the western hemisphere with potential to become a super-power, even a former CIA director acknowledges that. This clash of egos is what makes the relationship between both countries horrible. I love Portugal, but my only bad experience in an airport was at Portuguese Customs. The immigration agent shouted at me and changed his tone only when he saw how much money I make in Brazil. Then, he became the most pleasant person. I would always go back to Portugal, but I do have to say this: Portugal is no longer a world power. Is just a small and struggling state in Europe. Like all southern European countries. Secondly - Where I live, Florianopolis, although the architecture is very Portuguese and the colonization is very Azorean, I grew up in a neihghborhood where most of my friends were either of Italian or German descent. I am half Italian myself, and I could even get an Italian passport if I wanted to. So, as Brazil received an influx from several countries, we see Portugal mostly as a country that lost everything and with little importance to our culture. Portugal is just one of the many players that formed Brazil. However, brazilians are very proud of speaking portuguese and we love the fact that we are alone on this in south america. We are actually happy for not being part of hispanic america, thanks to Portuguese colonial past :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, in the south region of Brazil, we don\u2019t have access to anything of Portugal. We don\u2019t watch TV shows, movies or any other program from Portugal. So we don\u2019t know their culture or anything related. In fact, I was surprised when I knew the history before Portugal be a country. We just know the bacalhau and the Fado because Roberto Leal had a great success here in the past, but I think the newest generations don\u2019t know him. We have some stereotypes about portuguese people, as in some jokes we put them as if they were idiots. We always name the portuguese man with Manoel or Manuel. We think that portuguese women have mustache and their name is Maria. They start all the phrases with \"Ora pois\" and they just eat bacalhau and \u201cpastel de bel\u00e9m\u201d.  When we think about portugueses, we remember this costumes above. Here (click in the link) we have a representation of a portuguese in a children's soap opera and here of a portuguese woman in a comic program. In our schools we learned that our country was founded by Portugal, deceiving and killing indigenous people and enslaving indigenous and black people. Sometimes we blame Portugal for our behavior and our endemic corruption because just useless people were sent here. Yes, we learn that Portugal was just a evil colonizer looking for a country where it could steal gold, cotton, spices, sugarcane and, in our case, pau-brasil (a red special tree from here). In our schools is teached that the brazilians didn't wanted Dom Pedro II as emperor and as we asked for a republic, the marshal Deodoro da Fonseca did a military coup and proclaimed the republic. It\u2019s funny because here in Joinville, we have a great respect for the princess Francisca de Bragan\u00e7a, sister of Dom Pedro II. In fact, in the past the founders of Joinville did a house to her and her husband Fran\u00e7ois d'Orl\u00e9ans, a french admiral. In nowadays this house is a museum.  Another funny thing is that we still have the imperial family and we don't care about them, very different of England, but because of corruption many people ask to return the empire with them in charge. Summarizing everything is: we think that Portugal was a evil colonizer, nowadays they are stupid, copy our memes and their womans have problems with depilation. But if they visit our country, as a hospitable people, we'll welcome them very well. ",

            "answer_text": "In general, Brazilians don\u2019t mind the Portuguese, and I would say that we have a mostly friendly relationship. Amongst certain groups there are some colonial grudges, but as a whole Brazilians seem to respect our European lusophone peers. There are jokes about the Portuguese, but no one takes them seriously, and I believe similar jokes about Brazilians exist in Portugal as well. Since her incorporation to the European Community (now the European Union), Portugal became a very attractive place for upper-middle class Brazilians and, as a matter of fact, Portugal received a lot of Brazilian immigrants fleeing the rampant inflation and economic malaise from the 80\u2019s and early nineties. Curiously, since the beginning of the super harsh austerity imposed by the European Central Bank on the PIIGS countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain), now we see the reverse trend: thousands of super qualified Portuguese now move to Brasil to find a job. Our peoples share a lot in common culture-wise, especially descendants of Portuguese people, like myself and most of white and mixed-race Brazilians. Unfortunately, we do not watch Portuguese television, and sometimes we find a little bit difficult to understand their accent (Portuguese place their emphasis on consonants and cut off vocalic sounds while Brazilians place emphasis on vowels and many times cut off consonants and whole syllables). We do not use Portugal as our cultural reference as the US sometimes do in the UK. It is hard to make general statements about this feeling because Brazil is a country deeply divided by class boundaries (although most Brazilians will say they are \u201cmiddle class\u201d) and each segment of the population might have a different perception of our European peers. In general, we are a rather poorly educated people in a very inward looking country. Upper middle class and upper class \u2014 Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers, University Professors, high profile Civil Servants, medium- and big-sized company owners, Politicians, Industrialists, and Oligarchs \u2014 usually find their cultural references in the United States, in France, or in Italy. In Brazil, we study the formation of the Portuguese Nation-State in our school curriculum. Portuguese literature is central to our education. We share a similar History and even had the same Royal House ruling both our countries (the Bragan\u00e7a Kings of Portugal and Emperors of Brazil). I feel very close culturally to Portugal, and since I had my DNA analyzed by 23andMe, this connection became stronger. The same Lusitani, Roman, Jew, Suevi, Visigoth, Arab and nNorth African genes that are in the Portuguese blood are in my blood, and I feel extremely proud of this very diverse and colorful heritage.

            "answer_text": "If Brazil has to choose a relationship status in Portugal in Facebook it would be \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. In daily life brazilians will have a mixed relationship about portugal. For instance, they will speak ill of Portuguese people, regarding them as dumb, ugly and rapists colonizers, although without the true resentments hispanic americans has towards spain. unless they have italian or german heritage they will more or less support portugal at a Football competition. For instance, when Portugal Scored against France at Euro 16 i could hear lots of cheer in my neighbourhood, the same way i saw it when Portugal scored against US at Fifa Fan Fest. Brazilians who have amore direct relationship with Portugal (i.e, have been/ living there or have relatives there) will have a even much more favourable approach. Middle and upper class Brazilians have a specially closer attitude towards Portugal. Some people complained that during the Euro\u2019s championships the Media adopted a too pro-Portuguese approach even tough in the end they support Portugal too. True it is that Brazilians will be warm and curious about Portuguese people when they are in Brazil, but if a Brazilian moves to Portugal it may be not that easy to adapt to some aspects of Portugal daily-life. Portuguese people are sometimes too literal minded, wich leads to some funny and awkward situations, but once a Brazilian gets to know Portugal and other european countries it becomes clear that we have lots in common. (As Brazilians, Portuguese people do not like to eat while walking like other europeans do). Portuguese literature is still influential in Brazil: Some Portuguese writers and books are mandatory in school and College, and Portuguese writers Fernando Pessoa and Jos\u00e9 Saramago are widely popular, but when it comes comes to pop culture, Brazil is much more influencial in Portugal (and portuguese-speaking Africa) than the other way around. One of the main reasons is because the archaic form of Brazilian Portuguese is easier to Portuguese people to understand than the European Portuguese is to Brazilians. Some Portuguese people will display annoyance in noticing the Brazilian Portuguese is more studied and known than the European Portuguese. ",

            "answer_text": "The relations should be described as warm and cordial, but somewhat distant. Brazil has moved past Portugal long ago. The average Brazilian has a vague impression of Portugal, often built on stereotypes of portuguese people being dumb, stockfish-eaters, bakery-owners (a disporportional number of bakeries in Brazil are owned by Portuguese immigrants) and their women having moustaches. The ones who get to know actual portuguese people may often regard them as too literal-minded, pessimistic, shy and with an unintellegible way of speaking. That being said, this impressions are mostly just humorous and there\u2019s absolutely no widespread anti-portuguese sentiment on the country like the anti-spanish sentiment present in Latin America. Strangely, even in Brazil, Spain is more associated with violent colonialism than Portugal (one can argue that the Spanish colonization was indeed much more violent). The truth is that we just have no concept of life in Portugal. Due to the vast difference on the size and economic power of the countries, Brazilian culture is much more influential in the Portugal (and increasingly in portuguese-speaking Africa) than the other way around. Portuguese people have been listening to Brazilian music and watching Brazilian telenovelas for decades while very few portuguese artists are known here. The only one that comes to my mind is Roberto Leal, popular in Brazil but reviled in Portugal. Some portuguese writers are still mandatory in Brazilian schools, though. Portuguese citizens are mostly well recieved and well treated. I remember when I was a child and was visiting my grandmother and great-uncles on the small town she lived in Paran\u00e1, Brazil and everyone in the town knew her and thought fondly of her. It\u2019s also common to see that - appart of some german and italian brazilians - that Brazilians tend to support Portugal in football matches - that includes the narrators. I remember people chearing in my neighbourhood when Portugal scored the winning goal against France in the Uefa Euro and how the Portuguese delegation was cheered at the olympics (the spanish atletes were often booed). Cristiano Ronaldo has legions of fans in Brazil (it doesn\u2019t help that Messi is Argentinian, but still). Most Brazilians who come to Portugal tend to like it very much, as you can see on the testimonials here. Also, many brazilian celebrities and wealthier citizens and celebrities travel quite often to Portugal and some buy property there. Despite the distance, Portugal was still influential in Brazil during the 20th century in a few times. Brazil was one of the first countries to show solidarity when Portugal lost Goa and the CarnationRevolution had its impact on Brazil, wich was facing it\u2019s own military dictatorship. Portuguese citizens in Brazil enjoy some privileges other nationalities don\u2019t like automatic validation of documents, citizenship after one year of permantent residence while others must wait 15, etc, but things are so simple fot Portuguese citizens that both my mother and grandmother never bothered to get Brazilian citizenship ",

            "answer_text": "Hi guys, this is my another answer (the first one was at 2015).Now, I've traveled to Portugal three times. And it's so nice, sunny, beautiful, cool and guess what? Their language is Portuguese, like us, and all their streets, buildings, food menus, etc was in Portuguese too. I think this is so nice, a wonderful country that talks in Portuguese, I love this (I lived in Israel, USA, South Africa before) and to know that we have a nice country talking in Portuguese it's so lovely and familiar, it gives me a good sensation, I feel at home. Actually, I'm a Portuguese descendent, even my grand grandfathers were from Portugal. Really, I think that a LOT of Brazilians don't remember this. I'm from the northeast in Brazil and I think that almost 80% of us are descendants of Portuguese people. They founded Brazil, they keep it as a unified country (bigger and just one) not like South America with a lot of little republics. Portuguese people developed Brazil, brings bank, college, theater, gardens, books (tons), musical instruments, the language, the catholic religion, a lot of things\u2026 Actually, the Portuguese Royal Family come to here at 1808, this is the first time in the History that a Royal Family goes to a distant peace of land to set a new life. With them, all the Portuguese bureaucracy and public servers. Brazil comes to a Unit Reign of Portugal, and after our independence (1822), Brazil becomes an Empire, with a royal Emperor, Dom Pedro II, grandson of Dom Jo\u00e3o VI (this one who came here at 1808, despite Napoleon Wars in Europe). I love our history. I'm very grateful for all those Portuguese people to do for Brazil since 1808. I see people courageous, brave, crossing the Atlantic sea in poor ships, to have a better life in a new universe. Portugal will be always our deep roots. I know that Brazil has 210 million people and Portugal only ten million, but Dom Pedro I tells to his son, Dom Pedro II \u201cSon, Brazil is the future, stay here and try to develop here\u201d. And here we are. We are like a Portugal expansion , but with a new ID. I think Brazil and Portugal's people have to remember that we all have the same ancestors, we are the same people. We have a lot to help ourselves. So, finally, answering directly the question: I feel comfortable, my home too, land of my ancestors, part of me, and I wish all the best to Portugal. ",

I will split my answer in two, before and after I went to Portugal. Before: I Brazil we don't know much about Portugal, but I've met several Portuguese people who immigrated to Brazil, I always admired Portuguese people (and still do) for being so hardworking, but it always annoyed me how every Portuguese I met had something bad to say about Brazil. As far as Portugal as a country, it always fascinated me, I always wanted to visit \u201ca terrinha\", the land where my ancestors came from (although I never felt Portuguese myself), I always thought I could go to Portugal and find a connection, find my roots.Then, I finally planned to go to Portugal on vacation, I visited Porto, Cintra and Lisbon, indeed the country is as beautiful as I imagined, the food is delicious, Portuguese bakeries made me consume lots of calories, I just can't resist. Here is the bad part, I was mistreated every where in Portugal by almost all Portuguese people I did interact with, hotel, restaurants, etc, in fact Portuguese people were always nice to me when I first walked into a place speaking English with my wife (she is American), people would be really nice until I switched from English to Portuguese.When I took the train from Lisbon to Madrid, I had a really bad taste in my mouth. I didn't find the connection I hoped for, I almost felt that I was doing something wrong just for being there. I am Paulista and nothing more, as far as my Portuguese ancestry, I don't love it and I don't hate it, it just became irrelevant to me. ",

Portugal is to most people the country that \"discovered\" Brazil, and that rests in history books we just study as children and never again after a certain age. Portugal exploited Brazil in a very intense way during the colonial period, but it has been such a long time nobody consideres it relevant and has any kind of hard feeelings about it.  Portuguese people are the butt of jokes about stupidity (as much as Brazilians are the butt in Portugal, some people have told me). Portuguese culture is basically unknown and what little is known is considered somewhere between old-fashioned and plain corny. Portuguese music and cinema is basically unheard of. Portuguese literature is a little more popular, but just amont the most literate slice of the Brazilian people. Portuguese food is appreciated, but McDonands will rank waaaay up and Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish and probably even German food will rank above it too in terms of popularity. In the 2% segment of the Brazilian population that actually have enough money to travel to Europe during their lifetime (yes, Brazil is THAT poor), most people will think of USA, Canada, UK, France, Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Spain before thinking about Portugal as a destination. That changes when these people do not speak English; Portugal becomes a much more attractive perspective then. I am Brazilian and live in Germany. I'll probably visit all countries in Western Europe before feeling like going to Portugal. It is just that I never heard enough about it to make me interested. We hear about the US everyday, and Italy, UK, France, Germany and Spain much more frequently too. On the other hand, many Brazilians of the 2% segment are taking Master and Doctor level courses in Portugal, in what they call \"Sandwich Courses\", half done in Brazil, half done in Portugal. These courses are cheaper and easier to take and finish then Master and Doctor course in English speaking countries. Also, plenty of Brazilian women have moved to Portugal to get married recently. They meet Portuguese men online and end up moving there to marry them. Let's say they do it for love, not because Portugal has overall better quality of life than Brazil. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "I am Brazilian, son of Italians, and have never been to Portugal. Nonetheless, I live in Rio de Janeiro, in the harbour zone - which got to be considered the biggest Portuguese city of all Atlantic. The Portuguese language I speak (and everyone else in town) is much more similar to European Portuguese than the rest of the country. The way we pronounce the Rs and Ss, some sentences and sayings we use, it looks to me as if Portugal has once been here and yet it\u2019s still possible to feel it. The quick breakfast I have around some counter; the lady who owns the stationary store and greets me when passing by; the pasteis de bacalhau (in Rio, bolinhos de bacalhau) I soak in pure Portuguese olive oil (whose bottle is the fanciest just because it looks old); the smell of rosmarine and peppermint coming from a grocery store, or, if you\u2019re lucky, over a neighbour wall\u2026 In any central or suburbian neighborhood, you can see a bit of Portugal in the houses, even in the accent - the last generation of immigrants is dying now. Yet you see a Saint Joseph in tiles, above the entrance door of a house. On Sundays, when I was a kid, I could listen to Amalia Rodrigues when walking down the sidewalk of my street, among jasmine trees and savage rosmarine growing around the stone wall. All of this is Portuguese enough to me. It makes me love Portugal as if it were my own country. It makes me want to know about Portugal history, music, literature and people. I surely feel a brotherhood towards Portuguese people. We share centuries of common history. Yet it was a history where most Brazilians - in order to be able to feel Brazilian - had to cut relations with the \u201ccolonizer\u201d, even so we have a bond forever, as two different people that have shared a lot for so long. Portugal has never been the same after the colonial experience. Brazil has made Portugal big at its biggest, and yet Portugal today is not an imperialist neoliberal all-capitalist country. Portugal invented a Paradise on earth. And even though this might be \u201conly history\u201d, our destinies, as people, are linked for good. I regret the fact that our midia pays no attention to what has been going on in Portugal, and also in the other former colonies. That would be just awesome if we had more exchange. Our education system should also have more bonds. How great it would be if teenagers took their exchange high school trip around Portugal and vice-versa. Every Brazilian should have the right to visit Portugal! It\u2019s a dreamland to many of us. Some of that old Portugal was brought here, and has helped form our soul, our collective manners. And also, every Portuguese should have the right to visit Brazil once in their life. Afterall, we all need a paradise. Imagine that generations of Portuguese have dreamed of making fortune or finding happiness in Brazil, since 1500. So many sailors, merchants, common people risked their ways towards this unknown land. This is so amazing! I just love Portugal as much as I love Brazil. I love it like it was my grandmother. I know many Brazilians (especially, but not only, cariocas) that would identify with the elements I pointed out. When I see Portuguese movies, even our way of crying and laughing is so similar. I am sure my dream trip to Portugal will surely happen one day, and I imagine I\u2019ll be blasted! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, I\u2019m Brazilian and, being sincere, Portugal gives me mixed feelings. My great-grandmother was Portuguese, who had children (and my grandmother) with a man from an indigenous group in Brazil called Kaingang. Don\u2019t ask me how they met, she, in fact, separated all his children and gave each one to an abusive family. When she gave away my grandmother, my grandmother never saw her brothers/sisters or parents again. She to this day seeks to find them.  Kaingang tribe example In my family, we sometimes make Portuguese jokes, but considering we do have Portuguese blood, it\u2019s just to joke around a figure, not actual Portuguese people.  We Brazilians had an awesome meme fight against Portugal some time ago. We rocked and won against them, of course. #pride  The Portuguese men that came here massively killed and enslaved the local indigenous tribes (not that each tribe didn\u2019t kill one another already). They were the first to explore too much land in Brazil. The Pau Brasil, the reason our country is called like that, was nearly driven to extinction because of their exploration. My history teachers used to say all the country was full of this tree. I\u2019ve never seen one in my life, they are mostly confined to a few lands, mostly in plant research centers.  The tree I was just talking about My aunt has been living in Portugal for some decades already. She loves being there, obviously. I\u2019ve never heard her bad mouth Portugal and one thing she told me I found interesting: famous Brazilian television series, \u201cnovelas\u201d, like \u201cAvenida Brasil\u201d were very popular there too. The contrary isn\u2019t common uh.  So to conclude, we have seen bad and good faces from Portugal. Many, many Brazilians are somehow related to them, considering that they were the first to exploit our lands beside the indigenous tribes and their children were called the first Brazilians. I myself am a neutral, as I have never been there and experienced it fully to be able to say anything. One day I want to visit Portugal and my first stop will be at my aunt\u2019s. We\u2019ll sip Porto wine :)  P.S.: I\u2019m not very proud to say that, but Europeans have a bad fame here of being dirty and not bathing, and this extends to the Portuguese. Uh. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not Brazilian, nor am I Portuguese. I am from Angola, another ancient Portuguese colony. I have been familiar with both countries and their respective cultures from a very young age thanks to the imported TV shows from Brazil and Portugal in Angolan television. In respect to the matter in hand, I feel like Brazilians hold more negative feelings in respect to the portuguese than the opposite. These feelings usually are manifested as a superiority complex justified by some recurrent elements : \u201cBR-Portuguese is better\u201d, \u201cWe have better economy (while Portugal is just a struggling European country) and better European roots\u201d namely Italian and German (which they seem to be very proud of). Ironically enough, I think this superiority complex is actually a way to mask an inferiority complex, but that's another subject. I think it is a shame that the average Brazilian isn't able to understand EU-portuguese very well (the portuguese series Morangos com a\u00e7\u00facar had to be subtitled in Brazilian TV) . I do not think it happens because EU-portuguese is particularly complicated to understand, it happens simply because Brazilians do not seem to very interested in conserving cultural ties with Portugal. Sometimes it seems like they want to purposely turn their country into some kind of tropical-USA-copycat. My opinion on the matter is heavily influenced by what I've witnessed on television, and specially on internet, so it probably does not live up to reality, or isn't representative of Brazilians as a whole. However, I did witness it often enough to think that that is how Brazilians view the Portuguese. That being said, I have no feelings of hatred towards Brazil, nor do I put Portugal on a pedestal. This response is simply how I personally see the relationship between both countries, and I am aware that I'm making a generalization, which is not representative of all Brazilians. ",

            "answer_text": "Its not the first time I read a negative comments from Brazilians of partial Italian or German descend trying to distance themselves from Portugal or Portuguese, are they blind or what? I don\u2019t quite understand! It should even be insulting to the large majority of Brazilians, being the large majority of 80% to 85% of Portuguese descend. During the football World Cup 2010,Brazilian manager (Dunga) real name Carlos Caetano Bledorn Verri, by the surname looks like he is of partial Italian descend,said before a match against Portugal: Brazil A vs. Brazil B. That was Dunga's definition of the duel against Portugal, for the third round of the World Cup. The presence of naturalized Brazilians in the Portuguese team made the coach play with one of the most attractive games of the group stage in 2010. Carlos Queiroz, commander of Portugal, responded with irony. \u201cWe are going to play against Brazil. It will be team A against team B \u201d, evaluated Dunga, referring to the presence of naturalized Portuguese Brazilians in the European rival. Pepe, Deco and Liedson were at the time constant names in the calls for the red-green team. Asked about Dunga's statement, Carlos Queiroz didn't let it go. \u201cIt is good to remember that the majority of Brazilians are children,grandchildren, great grandchildren etc..of Portuguese. So it could really be a game between Portugal A, B, C and D \u201d, in fact Brazil is A to Z Portuguese,replied the Portuguese coach with irony.  (Attached a picture of a Brazilian Police leaflet from 1942,alerting the Brazilian population that it was forbidden to speak in Italian, German or Japonese). It also says \u201c in Brazil we speak Portuguese \u201c all violators will be punished with all strictness of the law. Some Brazilians with partial Italian or German descend probably are eating only pasta, Pizza and schnitzel,because they don\u2019t recall any Portuguese themed cousine or anything from Portugal. Some even dare to want to call the language they speak \u201cBrazilian\u201d and not Portuguese. Very fiew Portuguese share the same opinion unfortunately, very embarrassing! They most likely never spoke Portuguese,never eaten Feijoada,drank cacha\u00e7a or celebrated carnival,just to name a very tiny proportion of things they don\u2019t realise that are originated from Portugal and brought to Brazil, and also they are clearly the Brazilian identity in terms of food, drink and celebration. Some people are just blind and don\u2019t connect. Don\u2019t take me wrong, I know there are a few Portuguese with the same separatist mentality as well, some dare to call the language spoken in Brazil a Brazilian not Portuguese\ud83d\ude02 like I mentioned earlier, I just blame missinformation or even education either way. I invite all Brazilian haters to come and visit Portugal,both the cities, and also the country side from the north to the south,Speak to the people, eat our feijoada ,drink our (cacha\u00e7a) aguardente,celebrate the carnival with us etc.. you will see how close we are. I would also advise the few Portuguese haters I have seen here in Quora to visit Brazil as well. Stop being separatists and connect. We have so much in common. We are \u201cFarinha do mesmo saco\u201d (birds of feather). Peace-Paz ",

The radical left is always vigilant on relationships of oppression, so it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that our history teachers narrate our colony years as the story of an Oppressor and an Oppressed. They took our gold. They enslaved our natives. They\u2019re brute and they mismanaged everything. They are the reason we have so many problems today. Most people grow up to become too busy to better research our colony years. We\u2019re already demotivated to begin with of course. Only recently I\u2019ve been researching on the topic and finding out the great work Portugal did in overall structuring our country. They also left us beautiful art, music and traditions. The Brazilians who tend to be in awe with anything foreign (there\u2019s some of them\u2026 ok plenty of them) usually look up to the States and want to be more North-Americanized. I like the States myself but if you ask anybody about Portugal most people won\u2019t have anything to say, or say something they \u201clearned\u201d in school. Hopefully people will become more interested in Portugal and our colony times. We should be proud of our history and the close ties we have with Portuguese people. PS: As for the Portuguese jokes, I grew up in the nineties and if you had asked me then why such a thing, I had no idea. They were just there. But me and my friends would joke about other stuff. As we grew up, it seems to have died. I never really heard anything related to it, much less an actual joke, in a long, really long time. ",

            "answer_text": "Though the portuguease roots of Brazil are undeniable, being one of our most visible and \u201clistenable\u201d influences of Portugal, we simply can't make a just and fair image of Portugal, even less have a feeling about such a distant reality like Portugal. In a way, Portugal is as close to brazil as Spain, France, Italy are to Brazil, even more distant countries but still european ones play the same role, like Germany or holland. Brazil is a mosaic of cultures, a country that is a world itself, counting about 200 mi members, speaking different accents of portuguease, feeling linked to so different traditions and cultural roots that come from so many different parts of the globe, and however, the smashing majority of Brazilians will have lived their entire lives without having crossed their country\u2019s borders. Though Brazilians speak portuguease, they feel much closer to Italy in their roots, their not very far ancestors were Italians and they have a similar accent, and speak a lot with their hands, and are much more used to good Italian food though a reprocessed version of that kitchen taught by their grandpatents who were genuine Italians but reprocessed and retranslated by the brazilian Melting pot of varied ethnic bases, indian, African, Latin, Germanic, even from the east side of the globe. Many Brazilians speak portuguease, but they feel they have much more to do with Japanese for their parents or grand are Japanese Or Chinese. brazil\u2019s oficial language buy portuguease from portugal is hard for a Brazilian to understand completely, simply because brazilian Ears are not used to listening to that variety of portuguease. Variety of portuguease? But it\u2019s the original portuguease! Brazilian is not so aware and concious of his roots as an European is, and thats not only a matter of theoretically being a less educated people, which its not totally true, because there are probably many millions much more educated people in the vast Brazil than there are in tiny Portugal. The fact is that it\u2019s impossible to be a Brazilian totally aware of his roots and traditions. A Brazilian feels and knows Portugal plays a important role in Those Things. But a brazilian can only be aware that he is part of the result of an intense mix of different ethnic groups that once upon a time arrived at the vast east side of south American continent and decided not to remain pure and virgin in the middle of the carnival.

            "answer_text": "As a brazilian of Italian heritage, living in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, where Italian influence is far more noticeable because of the heavy Flux of Italian immigrants during the first half of the 20th century, I can say brazilian relationship with Portugal is near to none. We currently have no idea of what is happening in Portugal, even the most literate Brazilians are quite ignorant of their country. In some regions like Rio de Janeiro portuguese inheritance plays a bigger role, at least in their accent heavily borrowed from Porto, a portuguese region. As for the pop culture, Brazilians usually are happy with the stereotypical characters that don't resemble actual Portuguese people a lot. Almost nothing is known about Portuguese TV shows or celebrities. The only exception is literature - we do study some of the best Portuguese authors in school. But it doesn't go much further. I've heard somewhere that Portuguese people know much more of our pop culture than we know about theirs. Our TV shows, singers and actors enjoy great popularity there. It sometimes seems that even today Portugal sees Brazil as an extension of their country, but the other way round simply is not true. Brazil sees itself not only as a stand-alone country but also a quite isolated one with near to no interaction not only with Portugal, it doesn't interact with its Spanish-speaking neighbors either. North American pop culture has infinitely more influence in Brazil than Portuguese (or any other country's) culture anyway. In brief, there\u2019s no feeling of hate towards Portugal, and little colonialist resentment though. There\u2019s only a feeling of distance and disconnection overall. ",

So in the end of the day we are at home away from home in Italy and Portugal. IMO Brazil has some \u201c parenting issues\u201d with Portugal. In part the sentiment is correct and in another history was changed in Brazil to fit the Republican coup to the Monarchy (we liked our King and our future Regent Princess Isabel) Portugal didn\u2019t implant in Brazil a strong enough political system and let us to deal alone with the endless problems a slavery past and back then present can make to a country. On the other hand the Princess lost the throne for wanting not only to end slavery but give compensations to slaves and make women suffrage in the late 18th century. Brazil\u2019s history unlike most colonies is a series of \u201c what if\u2019s \u201c that could change the course of our own history, maybe the history of the entire region. What country would Brazil have became if Isabel managed to do what she intended? In many ways we will be forever connected to Portugal, Brazilians and Portuguese liking it or not that\u2019s our history. Is like Brasil and Argentina, brother countries, always arguing against each other, yet the love is there and also the true friendship. Portugal might be booed and shit talked, but if hard times ever come due those insane EU policies towards refugees, there\u2019s no way Brazil wont intervein in Portugal\u2019s best interests as we did many times before. Portugal is part of our roots and like any good Latin family there will be arguments, sometimes very loud ones, but we forget all about the mess and hug each other ",

            "answer_text": "There are still a lot of portuguese descendants in Brazil. One of my best friends\u2019 grandma, for instance, came to Brazil decades ago. So, there are some cultural exchanges between Brazil an Portugal. We have three football clubs in Brazil named after Vasco da Gama, that was a famous portuguese explorer. One of these clubs is Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama that only stays behind Flamengo when we talk about the number of fans here in Rio de Janeiro. Besides that, there is another football club called Portuguesa, that would mean Portuguese. The Order of Christ Cross is another cultural exchange we had lots of years ago and still is very present in Brazil. Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama\u2019s anthem mentions this cross, that is one of the main symbols of the club. There is an archipelago here in Brazil called Fernando de Noronha, which was named after Fern\u00e3o de Noronha, a famous portuguese merchant. We are kind of influenced in cooking. Bacalhau is a very famous dish in Brazil and Bolinho de Bacalhau is a must-have in Brazil. I think we are not that influenced by TV shows and movies because we can\u2019t take anything spoken in Portugal\u2019s portuguese seriously. Their accent is too funny for us. Besides that, it can be really difficult to understand their portuguese if they start speaking faster. In literature we study about Fernando Pessoa and E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s at school and Jos\u00e9 Saramago is really famous around here. Jokes about how literal portuguese people are were very common when I was young, about 10 or 15 years ago, but nowadays I hardly ever hear something about it. ",

Despite that, once I helped tourist Brazilian family that was kind of lost in Coimbra, and while I help them find their way I was able to chat and they told me that they were touring the whole country and that they were loving it. But the most significant thing they told me was that they now comprehend Brazil much better, that a lot of things they were used to see all their life in Brazil, now are much more perceptible in light of what they saw in Portugal. It might not be a generalized opinion but it is in accordance with the perspective of portuguese people who went to Brazil and recognize a lot of Portugal there. The same happens when portuguese peolpe go to Macau and some parts of India (Goa) despite these two examples being totally immersed in totally different cultures still have something of Portugal in them. I think this is a nice question since in Portugal we pay a lot of attention to what happens in our former colonies, we ear a lot of Brazilian and Angolan music, we see a lot of Brazilian movies and telenovelas, in the news and press the politics of all former colonies are talked about a lot, and so on\u2026 But it seems that this is not reciprocal at least relative to Angola and Brazil (that are the ones that get the most attention). I guess this is because Portugal is so small and most of the former colonies are so bigger\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, let me try to say something original. I\u00b4m born and raised Brazilian and I was 2 times in Portugal exploring, specially the north, my favorite part.I think Portugal is a place \u201clost in time and space\u201d. In a very good way. Go there is like a time-travel experience. Get out of my city (Salvador, Bahia, 3 million people, most poor) and visit Porto (only 250.000 people, no slams or poor neigborhoods) is a cultural shock, for example. They seem very organized, simple, conservative and also very naive. Also the sense of humor is very different (sometime we brazilians do not understand the things they think is funny and judge they are dumb, wrongly). They also have their own pace, their \u201ctime\u201d is different, they do not rush or are too greedy as people are here in my culture. I think this is very good for the quality of life.Well, this is just my point of view, But most part of Brazilians that really know Portugal and their small cities agreed with me. ",

            "answer_text": "In general we don\u2019t think much because Brazilians know almost nothing about what happens in any other country, including Portugal. What we know is: You guys are more rich than us, and some of us think is because the gold who Portugal king stolen from Brazil. Obviously it's not because this, but like the \u201ctea tax\u201d that UK placed on the USA and this is part of the identity of what it is to be an American, the \u201cgold stolen from Brazil\u201d is part of our identity as well. It seems something smaller and not so important, since Brazil has so many natural resources. But it is an anger of our ancestors that was culturally transmitted and our identity is formed because that. Brazil is a very diverse country, so shared things like that unite us. Unfortunately it's anger, not something happy.A lot of Brazilian live in Portugal and they seems like it. They are fascinated with a country with a culture similar to ours that have good school, health, safety and cheap stuff.We are also somewhat envious of the proximity to the rest of Europe allowing cheap tourism. Tourism for Europe in Brazil is extremely expensive.We love the Cristiano Ronaldo. Yes, he is better than Messi. And he is a \u201cRonaldo\u201d, seems like he inherited the Brazilian heritage from this name full of talent.We know as well about Deco, a Brazilian guy who played in Portugal team.Some Brazilians will probably know that Portugal is part of the PIGS: countries who the rest of Europe make jokes about their economy. Don\u2019t let them do this!We make some jokes about you guys being dumb. It\u2019s sad, but I heard that you guys make the same joke about another region in Portugal. Since that I don\u2019t fell more guilty to laugh about.",

From what I could gather, they mostly: Think we have no idea how lucky we are to live in a sunny country with almost zero violence (I think they're right)They also say we complain too much \u2014 that's also true, Portuguese people love to complain about everythingThey also think we're a bit \u201cpau no cu\" and too formal (in a way they're right, it's just that we aren't that nice on a first approach. But talk to us for a bit and we'll open our doors for you and offer plenty of food. It's probably going to be awesome, by the way. Not to brag, but bragging anyway, Portuguese food is GREAT)They think we don't talk about things and that we're a bit snob \u2014 also right. We tend to keep things to ourselves that sometimes if said could save us a lot of issues.I think that's it. Like I said, I'm Portuguese so my perspective will most likely be skewed.

Most Brazilians like the Portuguese accent - - for us, the accent has a romantic flavor to it. There are a few Brazilians that nurture some kind of \"historical\" resentment towards Portugal, but it is not really something to worry about: they will claim that the Portuguese invaded Brazil and then exploited the country and the people. Water under the bridge, anyway. Lisbon is, as an example of our love for Portugal, one of our favorite destinations in Europe. Portuguese restaurantes, scatered around Brazil, and typical Portuguese recipes are also proof of our love. Writers from Fernando Pessoa to Saramago are widely read and idolized here, and our mutual language is a bond that we, Brazilians, are all very proud of. Even so, there is still a lot for us to do to bridge this gap between us: we should, for example, start sharing  cultural artifacts - media, cinema, TV, etc. Brazilians are resistant to this kind of proximity. I really don't know how people in Portugal feel about that, although I know that we have, culturally,  great acceptance there, namely, our pop music and TV soaps. ",

            "answer_text": "I love Portugal and every time I read about Brazilian history or experience it live, I thank them in my mind for giving us the basis of our civilization in outlook, language, people, culture and morality. I find it amazing how in the big picture, we\u2019re destined to live and prosper the same way, even though we constantly feel our best times are behind us. There is a deep Sebastianismo and saudade in play there. You\u2019d be surprised at how the philosophy of everyday life is the same in the deep backlands of Brazil and the villages of Portugal, places still holding up to the globalizing modernism of the metropolis. How we value family, friendship and God. Live humbly and sort of melancholic/saudosista in our expressions such as art or music. We are both countries with many problems at home but to whom the Navigator\u2019s spirit calls louder to look to the world and conquer it. Brazil, before it was a nation, was an idea, and this idea was and still is Portuguese with all its virtues and flaws. Brazil has been failing to live up to it, just like Portugal for a long time has failed itself. Modern Portugal must be closer to Brazil, and I think the effort has to come from our side this time. EDIT: Coincidentally, a few days after writing this answer I find this, one example of the treasure of Colonial Brazilian music we were never taught about, or taught to ignore and look down upon. The Lusitanidade is, of course, there.  ",

            "answer_text": "I will give a more historical response. Until the 19th century most non-native or enslaved Brazilians saw themselves as Portuguese. There was never the kind of hatred as you see in other colonies. The Portuguese Crown established themselves in Brazil, in what other place did the king move to a colony? There was a small war during independence but it was fought mostly by portuguese people, royals nonetheless. After that the two countries started to diverge but outside of jokes I see no real animosity. In fact, it is enshrined in the constitution that portuguese people, and only them, have equality in rights with brazilian citizens if they are permanently living in the country. \u00a7 1\u00ba Aos portugueses com resid\u00eancia permanente no Pa\u00eds, se houver reciprocidade em favor dos brasileiros, ser\u00e3o atribu\u00eddos os direitos inerentes ao brasileiro nato, salvo os casos previstos nesta Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o.To the portuguese with permanent residency in the Country, if there is reciprocity in relation to the brazilians, inherent rights of the native born brazilian will be attributed to him, except in the cases detailed in this Constitution. It\u2019s also important to note that most brazilians have some degree of portuguese ancestry, even black brazilians have in many cases a male portuguese ancestor as can be determined by DNA testing. Having said that, most Brazilians don\u2019t care about what is happening in modern day Portugal. The countries are like brothers that took different paths later in life. ",

Of course Portugal strongly influenced Brazil in the past but today, at least in S\u00e3o Paulo which is the largest and richest city in Brazil, Portuguese influence is almost non existing. Upper class Brazilians dream about moving to places with higher standards of living such as United States and Canada, not Portugal. Some upper class Brazilians do try to get a Portuguese passport, but they use it to move to richer European countries like Italy, France, Germany, UK. I do love Portuguese culture as I saw its influence in my family, I have lived Portugal and I felt that the country had no future, low birth rates with and aging population, increasing corruption, and low salaries compared to other European countries. I respect Portugal for its roles in creating Brazil, but I would rather live in a country that is among the 10 largest economies and is definitely a global power, Brazil offers way more economic opportunities than Portugal does.

Most of us Brazilians regret the fact that we were constituted as a exploitation colony rather than a settlement colony like the US by England. \u201cShould we been estabilished by England, our country would be first world by now\u201d, they say. Who knows? Another thing is that we carry the stigma of being the very last country to officially put an end to slavery. 1888 to be exact. But that was not enough, since it was done by a signiture on a paper, and there was no real and planned \u201cdeslaverysation\u201d process. After being set free, the black brought from Africa were just \u201cset loose\u201d. They were still perceived as slaves or descendents for more than half a century, and were still treated as lesser beings. Brazil got independent in 1822, but the ways to do politics were not changed until the 20th century. So Brazilians like to pin this on the Portuguese. Also, Brazilians like to point out that some of the Portuguese worst came to here to \u201cinfect\u201d our institutions, such as bureaucracy and the culture of favors rather than the hard force of law. Tbh, I don\u2019t know to what extent this is all true. But the question is \u201chow do Brazilians feel about Portugal\u201d. Doesn\u2019t have to be fact-based, right? ",

I'm very close to the country and culture, because my grandmother, great-aunts and great-uncles were all Portuguese. I grew up hearing the accent (that I find delightful) and a vocabulary that isn't necessarily all that common to most Brazilians that have a more distant relation with that country. Culturally, I think people overestimate how close Brazil and Portugal are. I'd say, based on my own experience, it is not as close as England and the US. Even though Brazilian cultural exports may have made the Portuguese better able to understand Brazil than Brazilians can understand Portugal. It is a beautiful, underrated, landscape. Not just Lisbon - which is adorable and welcoming to foreigners - but other smaller cities as well; I mean, look at this:  Above, Porto at night. (thanks for the nice commenters that pointed out I suck at identifying photos I found on an image search).  This is Azenhas do Mar. I would be here posting pictures all day: Sintra, Mirandas do Douro, Porto, Peniche, etc etc etc. The joining of Portugal to the EU, in my opinion, has helped the country be better off in some ways than it was before. There is still a lot to be done, but I trust my cousins in Portugal to make of the small country the envy of the Portuguese speaking people. ",

I even have very good childhood memories where our cultures would mix without trouble during parties and friendly dinners. It was all natural, as if we were from the same country. But on the other hand, based on my online observations, what I think Brazilians think of Portugal or Portuguese people in general, is that they don\u2019t particularly like us...? For example, online, when someone talks about Portugal or the Portuguese language (European, to be precise) the comment section will be filled with Brazilians saying \u201cIn Brazil it\u2019s not like that, BR Portuguese doesn\u2019t sound like that, do a video about Brazil, COME TO BRAZIL, Brazil this Brazil that\u201d. But again, this is only my personal observation. I have observed a lot of anti-Portuguese sentiments that come in the shape of online hate and jokes and whatnot, but I\u2019ve also observed a lot of love towards their Lusitanian cousins and ancestors. Others just don\u2019t give two craps about Portugal. I think we can\u2019t really make a general idea of how they feel about us or our country, they are a very big nation after all \u2014 opinions greatly differ. ",

You know, I\u2019ve never being in Portugal during my whole life, I\u2019ve met some Portuguese, one of my cousins is married to one and their daughter was raised in Portugal.But everytime I see something about the Portuguese I can feel a strange and weird sensation of \u201cI know you but I have no idea how we met\u201d. Portugal and the Portuguese people seems to share a lot of things with us, even if you consider such things were modified by time and distance they still have similar if not the same foundation. In many ways, I don\u2019t feel alien when talking about Portugal and its people the same way I feel when talking about other countries. I think the only other countries I have a similar feel besides Portugal are other Latin nations. I don\u2019t have any bad opinion about Portugal, I don\u2019t hold any grudge either. I\u2019ve seen some Brazilians talking bad about the Portuguese but most of the time it seems they just want to blame someone for our own mistakes, not uncommon here and most places to be fair, no one wants to step up and say they did wrong, there\u2019s always the other side to blame for.

This concept was ludicrous for her, which I found a bit unsettling. I wish I had remembered telling her that Brasil got its independence from the \u201copressor\u201d while keeping the senior line of the Portuguese royal family (Lisbon got the younger daughter Maria II), which was actually living in Rio at the time; or that the unfortunate and oppressed colony only managed to end slavery 20 years after Portugal, who by the way had abolished the enslaving of South American natives in 1570.

When I\u2019m among Brazilians, I have the feeling that Brazilians and Portuguese have similar quirks. The quirks that the Brazilians have, however, strike me as a bit more exotic than those of the Portuguese. Until a few years ago, this aversion was only one-sided. The Brazilians hated the Portuguese, but the Portuguese were always fond of the Brazilians. I only learned about Brazil\u2019s aversion to Portugal when I lived in Paris and worked at a Brazilian restaurant. I realized that Brazilians really dislike the Portuguese. Somehow, I was shocked because the Portuguese always highly appreciated them. Meanwhile, the shock has disappeared. It\u2019s a pity if love is only one-sided. Now the Portuguese know where they stand and have consequently stopped wooing the Brazilians. ",

Women love my accent. As Brazil is continent-size, I would say Brazilians don't feel the need to visit elsewhere, or explore other cultures, also the poor level of education standards in Brazilian schools don't help fostering understanding the world, so it's only natural that many previous answers by Brazilians correctly state there isn't a lot of information on Portugal as there isn't as well concerning other old world countries. People here just don't care much about Portugal that is true, except\u2026.the educated middle class that aspires to live in a place without violence, good public services, fair taxes, no corruption, advancement opportunities for hard working and qualified professionals. Then they try to get a Portuguese passport. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably, there is no country in the world with half as much of cultural similarities with Brazil as Portugal. The reasons are pretty simple and obvious to some extent: They are the ones who founded our country, and most of Brazilians (like 80%) have Portuguese ancestry (25% had Portuguese-born grandparents or great-grandparents). People of Portuguese descent became a majority in Brazil yet during the 17th century (both due to a major flux of immigration from Portugal [which happened in order to cement their rule over Portuguese America, and for making it possible to fight the yet hostile tribes and the threat of the Dutch rivals who had taken over a large portion of the Northeast] and also because of the extremely fast decrease of indigenous population [not so much due to European warfare, as it is often assumed, but mostly by the microbian diseases brought by the Portuguese, mainly smallpox and flu] - See: \"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900\", by Alfred Crosby). There is a strong bond due to ancestry and the major cultural heritage. Unlike many people use to think, there was indeed a war between Brazil and Portugal for the independence that lasted 2 years (1822-1824), and has left about 11,000 dead (a small number if compared with what happened in the USA, in Haiti, or in countries of Hispanic America, but yet a significant amount of people). These struggles have taken place mainly in the northeastern region of Brazil (like the Battles of Jenipapo, fought in the state of Piau\u00ed, and Itaparica, in Bahia). The war ended with a Brazilian victory after march 1824, and the then Brazilian Empire was officially recognised by the Kingdom of Portugal, on August 30, 1825. The independence, though, hasn't resulted in a harsh break up between the two nations, that kept very strong ties (starting from the point that Peter I, the first Emperor, of Brazil, was the son and heir of king John VI of Portugal, and would later abidicate the Brazilian crown in order to fight his younger brother who was usurping the throne of Lisbon, and ended victorious). The House of Bragan\u00e7a (the same that ruled Portugal since 1640) would remain running Brazil until November 15th 1889, when the economic elite and the Army took over the power through a coup d'\u00e9tat (the first in Brazilian history). In the sunset of the Empire, and after the end of slavery, more than 1 million of Portuguese (mainly peasants from northern Portugal: Minho and Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes) would make up the largest group of immigrants who entered in Brazil from 1880 to 1930, and made a major impact in our country's demograph. Along the 20th century, the relationship between the two nations remained close, even during authoritarian periods. Institutionally, the Portuguese hold some legal privileges that are not given to other foreigners in Brazil (Law of Equality of Rights), and the same happens to Brazilians in Portugal. During the darkest times of Brazilian economy (late 70's to middle 90's), a lot of Brazilians immigrated to Portugal, making the country the third in the world with the largest number of Brazilians expats, and since the Brazilian economic boom and the effects of European crisis in Portugal, the flux has reverted (about 50,000 Portuguese immigrants have moved to Brazil from 2000 to 2012, plus around 100,000 Brazilian expats who returned from Portugal). As it happens in any close relationship between two populations, stereotypes do exist. Some Portuguese people often look down on Brazilians, as they descend from the \"incult and primitive\" people who were starving in Portugal and for this reason have decided to enroll an \"adventure\" overseas, or from the \"criminals\" they have departed from across the Ocean centuries ago, in the times of Portuguese America. On other hand, the Portuguese are often taken as subject for stereotypical Brazilian \"dumb jokes\" (alongside blondes), but, by both sides, these things are not taken as serious in the vast majority of cases. Although there is, unfortunately, a growing xenophobic feeling in Brazil (due to the huge and increasing waves of immigration in the last years, coming mainly from countries like Haiti and Bolivia), Portugal is still a major partner, and Portuguese nationals who arrive here are yet treated with a \"familiar niceness\" by Brazilian people. . An edit added after some observation of the behaviour of some fellow Brazilians online: I'm Brazilian and I confess not to understand all this grudge some of us have towards Portugal. Other than being cling to completely outdated concepts that are still taught in History classes, like the dialectic between \"settling colony\" and \"exploitation colony\", which other than bearing some inherently racist premise that \"the more Europeans a land has the better\" (and in that they would have got a lot closer giving Guatemala or Bolivia as an example than Brazil), highlight only one side of the whole colonization process: all colonies were both of settling and exploitation, exploitation was the goal (no nation would conquer a land that gives nothing in return) and settling was the method, Brazil was not like Mexico or Peru: a pre-existent organized political structure with huge urban centers and a majority of citizens made up of peaceful peasants and conquered nations that allied with the invaders against a previous power they saw as oppressive. It was a sparsely populated land, where thousands of peoples who didn't even speak the same language (there was a continuum of Tupi varieties throughout the coast, but the natives of the inland, generally grouped as \"Tapuia\" spoke hundreds of languages that were completely different one of another) and shared any sense of unity, lived. There was no \"Brazilianess\" before the country was founded by Portugal, the native villages had mostly a sense of belonging only within themselves and their surroundings, unlike the aforementioned empires, all of them had their independent political and religious leaderships, their own warrior class and their own production, and unfortunately, most of the indigenous population, mainly in the coast, perished to European diseases (smallpox and flu, mainly), which together with the steady growth of the Portuguese influx, pushed them more and more into the land. The existence of Brazil as itself only happened due to the Portuguese presence, there was no Brazil before it. I only opened this huge paragraph to explanate how strange that we blame Portugal for its \"invasion\", if we are, ourselves, part of these invaders (much of the rural elite of Brazil can trace their ancestry back to the caravels). If we genuinely cared about the gold and wealth that was stolen from Brazil, we would, ourselves, leave the country, give it back to the natives (the same natives we let die in miserable reservations that are marked according to the interest of landlords and not of the indigenous nations) and beg their pardon. After all, when we talk about this \"gold\", are we really denouncing an aggression or just reclaiming our right to pillage? Are we just trying to blame our problems on others? If that is what we want to claim back, why not to rise against our own elite than just place the responsibility out of reach? Ah, there are also those\u2026 \u201cAh, if the Dutch invasion in the 17th Century had succeeded, we would be much better off\u2026 Protestantism\u2026 Liberal value\u2026\u201d. Of course, they say it thinking about the Netherlands itself, not about Indonesia, South Africa, Suriname\u2026 When these people I often see online insult Portugal, it seems not to cross their mind that they are insulting their grandparents, greatgrandparents and so on. For instance, I find it sad to realize that Portuguese people know much more about us than we know about them. Brazil has a very selfcentered society. Both Brazil and Portugal have huge self esteem problems. It seems that people need to complain and yell to the winds the insatisfaction they bear inside, often talking over others (What Ant\u00f3nio Varia\u00e7\u00f5es sings about in \"Quando Fala um Portugu\u00eas\" totally applies to Brazil as well). Talking in common sense clich\u00e9s: Portugal sees itself as the country of the past, Brazil sees itself as forever the country of the future. Sometimes it seems that our pride was taken away from us centuries ago and we're still waiting for King Sebastian to bring it back with him from the sands. Even the flaws we point on ourselves seem to be the same: Again in clich\u00e9s, the \"Law of G\u00e9rson\" (wanting to take advantage in everything, over everyone) is the same think as the \"Chico Experteza\", \"Jeitinho Brasileiro\" also turns out to be identical to the \"Desenrascan\u00e7o\". In short, after being so long, I think that instead of looking for the shallowest interpretation of facts in order to make up quarrels, we should look for the things that unite each other. Fortunately, I think, most of people know well how to do it outside the easy pitchy online speech. ",

            "answer_text": "Portugal had a significant influence over Brazil, and that\u2019s the reason why we speak portuguese, but I don\u2019t believe that an avarage brazilian feels very close to the portuguese people, because we had many other influences from other cultures that gives Brazil a distinctive character when compared to Portugal. Africans, specially the ones of Banto and Ioruba origins had a very high impact in brazilian culture and genetics, some words we speak are from african origin, such as \u201cbunda\u201d(ass). Brazil has the second largest african population of the world and the biggest one outside africa. Africans influenced the way we speak, the way we eat and the way we think. Native americans also had a very big influence among us, and many cities of the whole country, from north to south have native american origin, such as Pindamonhamgaba, in S\u00e3o Paulo. Some genetic researchers also stimate that there are around 57 milions brazilian with some degree of native american ancestry, which is a lot. The third group I believe that contributed to brazilian culture in order to make brazilians very distinctive of portuguese are the italians, specially in the southeast and south regions. On the other hand, in some areas of Brazil, speacially in northeast and Minas Gerais, it is possible to see a major portuguese influence, in the way people speak, in the local culture, religion, traditions and archtecture. Despite all the differences, from all the portuguese colonies, Brazil is the one that I believe that is closer to Portugal, but, I believe that other colonies, such as Macau, in Asia, feel a much higher conection to Portugal than we brazilians do. Although brazilians don\u2019t share the same lusitian identity with the portuguese, I believe brazilians tend to respect the portuguese and that colonial hurt feelings are not common. Portuguese will be seen here as foreigners, but maybe a foreigner a little bit closer to us than a german, for example. ",

            "answer_text": "I always say that Brazil is a very diverse country, but here in S\u00e3o Paulo, people tend to see Portuguese surnames as \u201cordinary thing\u201d, especially Silva, Souza and Oliveira, and Italian and German surnames as \u201csuperior\u201d, although that has no practical implications. I am proud of my 12.5% Portuguese descent, especially because it\u00b4s probably from the time of the Bandeirantes, people that I am very proud to very likely descend from. They are the people responsible for Brazil now existing (although I think they should have thought better and built their own country in the lands they conquered by cutting relations with the Portuguese Crown) and have always been described differently from typical Brazilians and the Portuguese that colonized lands to the North of the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente (now S\u00e3o Paulo and neighboring states). Contrary to perhaps most of Brazil, I am grateful for the Portuguese colonization of my land although I understand they committed serious mistakes. I feel I should continue their work of trying to build a great land to live and, at the same time I enjoy what they did before I was born, I see myself in a position to try to correct their mistakes and do what\u00b4s necessary to make my land, S\u00e3o Paulo, a greater place. Anyway, although I am proud of my descent, I recognize that the Portuguese mentality is quite inferior to that of Northern Europeans and Portugal will not achieve a \u201cGerman-like\u201d level of development until they change the way they see the world and treat the underlying emotions that are transferred to each generation and shape that world view.

There are many similarities in culture, of course, but people love to talk about differences because they sound funny. There are many jokes about the Portuguese (usually involving Portuguese women having bushy eyebrows and Portuguese men being dim-witted) but we do know that they tell jokes about us too (and we laugh at them when they tell them). I have never met a Portuguese immigrant who ever mentioned that he was not well-received in Brazil or discriminated against (but I have met some 20 or 30, counting those I have met on social media only).

I spent 10 days there in 2014 and another 10 in Spain. Love Spain too, of course. But I miss Portugal very much. Loved everyting about it, the people, the culture, the places, the food and the wine - ah, the wine. Would definetly return as soon as I can. But this is from a tourist perspective. And I can tell from most of my friends who have also been there, they all loved it too. Portugal is a very lovable place to visit. Aside from the tourist perspective, I also know quite a few people who have lived there and/or are right now living there, studying or working. The opinion is also almost unanimous: they all love(d) it. The ones who came back did so because they had no option. I lost count on how many times I imagined myself living there. Spent hours and hours talking to my wife about it, really considering it as an option. That is how much I love that country. ",

American celebrity media is full of the British Royal families activities, nobody in Brazil cares about the aristocracy in Portugal. The best content on American TV originates from great britain. Brazil gets nothing of their television from Portugal, plus its others means around. there is certainly a WASP elite in the usa North East which by meaning Anglo-Saxon by ethnicity and tradition. It was and remains effective. There is absolutely no equivalent in Brazil. Top of the class were as apt to be influenced by France or perhaps the United States as Portugal. In Brazilian preferred culture the Portuguese are considered to be slow, literal-minded, and traditional. ",

Even though he might wanted to sound diplomatic, it was something that made me rethink about how I felt about Portuguese people, as I said before, we share a great deal of history and a lot of our culture was introduced by the Portuguese so I guess that some appreciation is the least we could feel. We grew past the colony/metropolis relation, so since there are no hard feelings anymore I guess it is okay to have some consideration with each other. ",

The first days were difficult, because I was not used to the accent. In fact, I still take some time to get a word or even a whole phrase, and feel a little insecure when speaking to teachers or writing academic texts. I heard that they say that brazilians like to torture the portuguese language. Architecture is very similar to that of the cities I know (Rio de Janeiro, Florianopolis, Sao Luis) the food is really like my grandma`s, and contrary to what brazilians use to joke about, I met very sharp people, with good sense of humour.

Just goes to show, there are no ordinary last names, just ordinary people. Given the good reviews Portuguese receive from 90% of their foreign visitors, I would say, Portuguese are very far from being ordinary, and so are their last names! ",

American celebrity media is full of the British Royal families activities, nobody in Brazil cares about the aristocracy in Portugal. The best  content on American TV comes from the UK. Brazil gets none of its TV from Portugal, in fact it is the other way around. There is a WASP elite in the US North East that is by definition Anglo-Saxon by ethnicity and culture. It was and remains powerful. There is no equivalent in Brazil. The upper class were as likely to be influenced by France or the US as Portugal. In Brazilian popular culture the Portuguese are regarded as slow, literal-minded, and conservative. ",

As a student that just left high school last year, based on cultural aspects, i can tell you that our society was heavily influenced by theirs but we basically grew apart. For the most part we dont really have contact with other nations on a daily basis. Some dumb leftists are crazy about what happened in the past but it was a different time, nowadays most of us dont really care, because past aint changing anyway. Despite all the hystorical facts and everything i have to say that the european portuguese is kinda weird, i have a hard time trying to understand what they say if i watch a video or something like that (that doesnt mean much because i have a harde time trying to understand what brazilian people with the norther accent are saying on the phone lol). Anyway the bottom line is we dont care, they re like any other country. ",

Except for that country\u2019s significance in Brazilian history, the bonds that once united the two nations have disappeared as Portuguese influence started to wane. Recently, both states have engaged in forging a long lost cultural proximity. That might create business opportunities, but hasn't managed to increase Brazilians\u2019 interest in Portugal. The greatest exemple of cultural exchange between them is the television market: Portugal lends a few actors and Brazil sells its telenovelas. Due to historical and linguistic ties, one might think that Portugal and Brazil have mantained a close relationship as that of England and the US., but overseas remoteness and the scarce opportunities and needs for political and commercial collaboration have led metropole and colony to different paths. Therefore, Brazilians\u2019 collective consciousness regarding Portugal is not greater than Fado, wine and beautiful cities. ",

You tell me Portuguese jokes at your own risk, and praise the Dago or Kraut village As for the rest, I am proud or my Czech and French Basque blood (one great grandparent each). I am also really proud of my 6% Indian blood, although I don\u2019t have the faintest idea from which tribe it hails from (it must be one with a very scant sense of direction). I say: to a Brazilian with a Lebanese, German or Italian background, Portugal is he butt of jokes, To me, it is the Mother Country, The Old Land (A Terrinha) the place where I long to know that my bones were finally laid to rest pitifully enclosed in clay some day ",

We live together with Portuguese architeture, gastronomy and language, but no one stops in the middle of the day to think of this as a heritage. Even Portuguese immigrants are seen more like Brazilians with a different accent. On the other hand, there is no trace of grudge about colonization or other awkward feelings that might be speculated. Of course Brazilians feel closer to Portuguese people and culture than to any other European country. Still the relationship is quite distant, as most people here don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in Portugal nowadays. To make it simple, I would say it\u2019s like the feelings you have about a distant relative. ",

This might have to do with the fact that our history books mostly depict Portugal from the 16th century on as a weak kingdom, ruled by weak kings that were pushed around by the British. In that sense, they are more often mocked than subject of real hatred. Even our independence was mostly peaceful (except for some battles in my home state, Bahia, and a couple other places) and non-eventful, since the (Portguese) heir to the throne declared our independence, ruled for some years, left his infant (Brazilian) son to be groomed as an Emperor and went back to Portugal to fight a civil war. In that sense, there\u00b4s an impression of continuity that countries that had to severe all ties with the former metropolis maybe do not feel. ",

There are Brazilians jokes about Portuguese people being dumb, but no one knows where this jokes came from, and, frankly, no one even appeals to that humor anymore\u2026 I guess, since Brazilians know that Portuguese people aren\u2019t really stupid by default, it just stops being funny, because it makes no sense, even for the sake of the joke. Aside from that, there are also some big differences in dialogues, grammar and accents so Brazil and Portugal have a troublesome time to speaking to each other, but even though it\u2019s not THAT bad, if both speak english fluently, it might be easier to understand each other in english than using both types of portuguese.

Especially if you live in cities with strong portuguese influence (Rio, for instance), Portugal is actually quite \u201cclose\u201d. Aside from the obvious cultural influence in all aspects of life - Brazil is a former portuguese colony, so its influence is pervasive in many areas: cuisine, music, architecture, lifestyle etc. -, Portugal remains a hot topic amongst Brazilians, either as a tourist destination, gate of entry for immigration into the EU or simple jokes. Portugal is mostly seen as a sibling on the other side of the Atlantic. The first time I was in Portugal, I was amazed at how similar the people and the architecture of the cities themselves were to most Brazilian cities. It seemed I was visiting a major Brazilian city on another continent. ",

Here is one joke about portugueses: Pero Vaz de Caminha (an important portuguese navigator) sent a box of phosporus to Vasco da Gama (who were in Brazil) with a letter \"You must try this european invention Vasco\", when Vasco tried the phosporus they weren't working, then he sent a letter to Pero saying they were useless, thereby Pero replied wrathfully \"That is impossible, I have tried every single one here in Portugal and they've worked\" Hopefully this answered your question ;) ",

From my perspective, Portugal is a wonderful country, which I had the opportunity to visit only once (but I intend to return one day). There I felt like home: it was a strange feeling being abroad and still hearing my mother tongue. And it was easy to understand their accent (and I have to say I love their accent). I only had some problems in the North of the country, as they speak too fast for me. People, in general, were very kind to me and often wanted to have information about Brazil and how big it is compared to European countries. So far, so good, but I've heard young Portuguese people are targeting some Brazilian students nowadays, as there are many Brazilians going to Portugal to study there. ",

Their excuse for anything that isn't as good as it should be is, \u201cIt's because we were founded by the Portuguese!\u201d Maybe they only say that to me because I am American, but they seem to mean it. Depending on my relationship to them I might let it slide, but if I know them well, I will say, \u201cCome on, that's been 5 centuries! When are you going to assume responsibility for your own country?!?' It's rude, but they let it go and we move on. ",

            "answer_text": "The preconception of a Portuguese person in the view of a Brazilian person is that the Portuguese isn't Smart. Downright dumb, actually. This happens mostly because Portugal had the control over all the riches in Brazil, explored them for a long time, and haven't developed a permanent prominent economical status. Another reason is because we think they are quite literal on the usage of the language, which Brasilians aren't. An example is that when a Brazilian tells you that he or she is \"da quebrada\", the literal meaning would be that he or she is \"from the broken\". In fact what is being said is that they are from a poor neighborhood, while we imagine a Portuguese person would ask us what is broken. What I'm trying to say is that in Brazil words more often than not get new meanings according to the context in which they're being used, while we think in Portugal they tend to stick to the original meaning of words at all costs.
