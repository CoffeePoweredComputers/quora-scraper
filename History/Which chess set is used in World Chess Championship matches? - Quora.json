            "answer_text": "FIDE has been experimenting with many chess sets finally settling for a modified classic Staunton design for the past decade or so. The Staunton Sets were first produced in 1849 and are famous for their great precision.  The present Chess Sets used in the World Chess Championship matches is designed by internationally renowned Pentagram designer and architect Daniel Weil. In the new Weil\u2019s design, the pieces conform to the exact height of the Parthenon\u2019s pediment - giving it roots in neoclassical architecture. The set pieces are individually carved and made out of rosewood and maple. The king\u2019s height is 3.75 inch. 50 cm board and 50mm squares. Until recently they were manufactured in India but now the manufacturing base seems to have moved to Germany. In case you are wondering to buy the set online, you can do so here: FIDE Home. $475 costs + shipping charges via DLF. Costs somewhere around INR 35,000 in India.  DGT sensors are added additionally for telecasting and other purposes during matches without any significant variation in the design.  And finally for the picture:  Beautiful! Ain't it? ",
