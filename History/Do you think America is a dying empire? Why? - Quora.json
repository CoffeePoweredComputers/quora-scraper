            "answer_text": "It is not an empire and it is not dying. The U.S. had a fling at imperialism in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. Vestigial remnants include the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which can leave if it votes to; the Guantanamo facility on Cuba, and a few small island territories. Imperialism is different from the extraordinary influence over smaller countries that come with great economic and military power. The American military presence from the Mideast to South Korea has often been cited as imperialism. Most of the Mideast presence stems from America\u2019s mistaken and many say stupid response to the attacks on New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania in 2001; which led to the mistaken and many say stupid policy that America should the the guarantor of immediate democracy in historically autocratic, war-prone areas that had no significant institutions to support democracy and where the prevailing political sentiments were for religion-based autocracy. And for every voice calling for the U.S. to leave there\u2019s another calling for the U.S. to stay and another calling for the U.S. to come in. It\u2019s very perplexing. The United States also has significant problems in national governance. But so does every nation. So has every nation in the past. So has every nation in the future. Nothing ever gets fixed so everybody can live happily ever after. ",

The world is becoming more nationalistic. There are reasons for the phenomena. All industrialized countries are facing relatively common problems. The industrialized nations include China. The geopolitical landscape is changing. Of all the geographic areas in the world. The US remains in a great position. The US debt is astounding, but the other western nations with debt, including China. are problematic as we. Let\u2019s say, for example, the world markets crash economies in the world contract. The US remains with the best economic resource ability. The US geographic isolation keeps The US out of major conflict. It has abundant resources, and the means to refine, and distribute the resources. The vitality of the US economic engine is strong. It is stronger than Europe, China, and Russia. It is stronger than all areas of the middle east. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but it does not mean that it will happen soon. They are getting lonelier day-by-day and power is shifting to asia right now. It may be surprising but capitalism will eventually make poor countries richer. Which will result in most of Asian and African population becoming consumers and companies making more investments in them. And this will hurt the rich countries of today by pulling them back to the median. While populous countries such as China and India get stronger. Death of America as a superpower is certain and has already started, but they will always remain in G-8 I suppose. Maybe a hundred years later, list of countries by population and by gdp will be same! Thanks to capitalism and globalisation. If no great war happens before it. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Abdulkadir, thanks for the A2A! I don\u2019t think America is a dying empire. It may be facing a huge test of its democratic form of government now, but it has survived worse. Additionally, as I described in some other, related questions, America is playing on geopolitical easy mode: it has unmitigated access to two oceans; abundant food and natural resources; a massive, growing and educated population (the largest in the developed world); the most powerful military in human history; friendly neighbours to the North and South; and a country that spans a continent. The other contenders for superpower status have too many geopolitical limitations \u2014 China is encircled and terrified of it, its population is greying and its economy slowing just as people are demanding better government services. India is currently too poor to project power and Russia is a one-trick pony dependent on war and its oil reserves to prop up its government. America might be losing its sheen and lustre, but it\u2019s not going anywhere. ",

The Roman empire looked awfully shaky through much of the 3rd century, but it lasted another few centuries (quite a lot of them, if you count the eastern empire). The US went through some turbulent times in the 1960s and 1970s, then had something of a resurgence. Maybe it will again. Or maybe not. ",
