            "answer_text": "While keeping the Greeks aside, though I think this would apply to them more or less as well, I would have assumed that most Romans would be far shorter than at least modern people of European descent (who, generally, are taller than most other genetic groups on the planet). However, analysis of the bodies found at Pompeii recommend the notion that not only were ancient Romans as tall as most modern European genetic pools, they lived just about as long and had actually less diseases in old age, even periodontal. (Caveats: A great deal of people died during birth, either the child or the mother, or both, as well as during childhood due to less-developed immune systems common in all children naturally then and now. That, coupled with the constant influx of diseases, especially malaria in large urban centers (partiularly Rome herself, a mosquito swamp since its earliest days) and the lack of modern medicine, made living past age 50 fairly rare. BUT, if you did, you had a good shot at reaching the standard average lifespan we now have in the developed countries of about 80 years. So while there were a lot less people that reached old age, many still did.) The ancient Romans, unless you were very poor, had excellent diets. Their diets, including the upper orders whom have been lampooned for centuries for being gluttonous, incorrectly writ large, ate what is essentially the best version of what we would call the \u201cMediterranean Diet\u201d: olive oil as the main lipid for cooking and so forth (milk was rarely consumed), seasonal vegetables and fruits (which had to be seasonal to eat, and eat fresh, as shipping methods though advanced for their time had little ability to preserve food save though salting or fermenting), fresh cheeses, and variations on wheat\u2014barley was consumed, but only by the poorest citizens, and rice was a novel crop, barely consumed as well. Most forms of grain were consumed as bread\u2014with white bread being the more expensive variety primarily eaten by the upper classes, a reversal of today\u2019s Western societies. And of course, wine: not harmful and possibly healthy in low doses. Meat across all classes was moderately consumed at best, and certainly not every day\u2014indeed eating meat every day even if you could easily afford it was considered uncouth and wasteful, barbaric (Tacitus is noted at being appalled by the Germanic tribes he visited who ate meat with abandon\u2014and worst of all, sitting upright!) not to mention unhealthy. The Romans despite popular conceptions were an austere and flinty people who tended to eat frugally. Drunkenness was frowned upon universally. For the most part, they were a semi-vegetarian culture. Though a thoroughly pre-scientific culture, the medicine they did have was not as wholly ineffectual as generally thought for societies preceding the scientific method. Doctors, primarily Greek, provided treatments for various maladies that actually worked much of the time\u2014applying garlic to wounds to stop the spread of what we now know as microbes, primitive surgeries, dietary guidelines for sicknesses that had effective results more or less some of the time. The doctors of the early scientific ages would rely on the historical case studies\u2014however mottled by time\u2014in the recorded histories of Rome and Greece. They of course relied heavily on the extant texts of the ancient Romans and particularly the ancient Greeks to get the ball rolling toward a scientific paradigm of medicine. Whether they knew it or not, those early Greek and Roman doctors were the avant la lettre of today\u2019s medical establishment. So. Were they tall? As much as today\u2019s Italians (and Greeks most likely). Yes. And their height would not be achieved again until the 16th Century in Europe and the Americas saving some people in the old Byzantine Empire; once society and order break down, as it did during Middle Ages, it affects everything, including health. When Rome fell in the West, the conduits for healthy living eroded just as it eroded the bodies of the populations there. ",

            "answer_text": "Not by our standards. The average heights for both men and women in both ancient Greece and ancient Rome were significantly shorter than the average heights for men and women in Greece and Italy today. Between 1944 and 1945, the anthropologist J. Lawrence Angel examined numerous surviving ancient Greek skeletons and, after examining the skeletons, drew up estimates of how tall each individual would have been when they were alive based on their skeletal remains. Angel concluded that the average height of a man in Greece during the Classical Period (c. 510 \u2013 c. 323 BC) was approximately 170.5 centimeters (5 feet 7.1 inches) and that the average height of man in Greece during the Hellenistic Period (c. 323 \u2013 c. 146 BC) was about 171.9 centimeters (5 ft 7.7 in). According to Angel\u2019s analysis, the average height of a woman in ancient Greece was about 159.2 centimeters (5 ft 2.7 in). Although Angel\u2019s original sample size was rather small, his estimates have been supported by subsequent studies with larger sample sizes, indicating that these estimates are indeed correct. For comparison, the average height of a man in Greece today is 177 centimeters (5 ft 9.7 in) and the average height of a woman in Greece today is 165 centimeters (5 ft 5 in).  ABOVE: Photograph of a life-sized Hellenistic Greek bronze sculpture of a victorious athlete, created between c. 340 and c. 300 BC. The statue in its current state is 149 centimeters tall, but it would have been taller originally, since it is missing its feet and the lower parts of its legs. A 2005 study by Geoffrey Kron, a professor at the University of Victoria, examined the heights of the skeletal remains of 927 adult males from various locations in Italy dating to between 500 BC and 500 AD. The study concluded that the average height of an Italian man between 500 BC and 500 AD was approximately 168.3 centimeters (5 ft 6.4 in). Unfortunately, Kron\u2019s study did not examine women\u2019s heights. For comparison, the average height of a man in Italy today is about 176.5 centimeters (5 ft 9.5 in) and the average height of a woman in Italy today is about 162.5 centimeters (5 ft 4 in). In other words, it seems that the ancient Greeks and Romans were, on average, about three inches shorter than people in Greece and Italy today respectively. This height gap is still significant, but not nearly as big as many people have incorrectly assumed. Since I am only 5 feet 3.5 inches (161.3 centimeters) tall, I would still be considered short for a man in ancient Greece or Rome. Go figure.
