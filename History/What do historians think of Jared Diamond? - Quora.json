            "answer_text": "I had a look through a few academic reviews of his work on JSTOR. The general opinion seemed positive. The word 'erudite' seemed to pop up frequently, and many reviewers thought his books were thought-provoking, original, and an interesting contribution to knowledge. There were some criticisms, of course. Most were minor, on the level of 'I didn't agree with his argument in Chapter 19\" or \"I think he overstates the importance of such-and-such a factor\". Diamond's books tend to deal with vast, sweeping themes covering many different cultures over thousands of years. Inevitably, such a broad-brush treatment can lead to generalisations, or mistakes over fine detail, which will be apparent to specialist historians who've spent years studying that one specific society and period. Linked to this is the fact that Diamond is a populariser; he synthesises the research of others to support his theories, then writes books aimed at the general public that become bestsellers and win Pulitzer prizes. It's not impossible that some academic historians might feel a certain amount of jealousy or resentment, or dismiss Diamond as \"not a 'proper' historian\".  I've also seen criticism of Diamond that comes from a clearly ideological basis. Diamond's theory, after all, is that Western dominance of the modern world was based on accidental geographical factors, and not on the racial superiority of white people or the moral superiority of capitalism or the Protestant work ethic. He's also an environmentalist. Some people, often to the right of the political spectrum, find such theories anathema to their own views of how the world works. In short, most historians I'm aware of would regard Diamond's work as definitely worth reading, but with an open mind. ",

Source: https://www.unm.edu/~dcorreia/David_Correia/Research_files/Correia_F**K_CNS.pdf \"His crime spree continues with 2012s The World Until Yesterday: What Can WeLearn from Traditional Societies?, which takes its readers on a racist tour from theprimitive to the modern. Give him credit, he may be a hack but he is a clever hack.And he knows how to make himself useful. He disguises the racism of his biologicaland environmental determinism in a Kiplingesque narrative that seems downrightthoughtful and caring. They\u2014those primitives\u2014have so much to teach us moderns.We have an obligation, a burden you might say, that comes to us ordained by adivine accident of geography and environment, and so we must, with humility (andsometimes bombs), cultivate that exceptionalism. And, of course, the subtext here isthat our exceptionalism is not a thing, but a relation; it cannot exist without theirprimitivism. These are not categories but relations biological and environmental innature.\" Source: Anthropology\u2019s Guns, Germs, and Steel Problem \"In fact, this utterly misrepresents the history of anthropological theory, how most working cultural anthropologists think about the human story, and the bases of anthropological anti-racism. Franz Boas was very clear that \u201cwe have no evidence of a creative force of environment\u2026 It is sufficient to see the fundamental differences of culture that thrive one after another in the same environment, to make us understand the limitations of environmental influences\u201d (Race, Language, and Culture 1982 [1940]: 255-256). Likewise, Diamond\u2019s thesis would be anathema to any Marxist anthropologist. Diamond does not take \u201cmodes of production\u201d as the causal motor of his thesis. This is because any mode of production is a social product of human history. Diamond\u2019s explanations are located much anterior to this \u2013 in geography and ecology, which are taken to stand outside of, apart from, and entirely antecedent to human productive action.\" Source \"Jared Diamond is racist.\" -- Why? \u2022 /r/AskAnthropology \"There's a lot of hatred for Diamond in Anthropology. Some of it's justified - yes, he oversimplified things. Some of it isn't - oversimplifying things in a popular science book is probably ok. I think the charges of racism have come about because, over the last few decades, Anthropology has moved away from comparison seeing it as wrong because it implicitly judges the things compared. You can see how Diamond's explicit comparison of Europe with New Guinea triggers this.\" Source: Is Jared Diamond racist? \"Jared Diamond is back at it, once again trading in the familiar determinist tropes that earned him a Pulitzer Prize for his 1999 book Guns, Germs and Steel. That dull book was chockfull of the bad and the worse, the random and the racist. At best it is just silly, as when he offers unsupported, and unsupportable, assertions such as his get-off-my-lawn grouse that children today are not as smart as in the recent past and television is to blame. At worst, it develops an argument about human inequality based on a determinist logic that reduces social relations such as poverty, state violence, and persistent social domination, to inexorable outcomes of geography and environment.\" Source: 'Guns, Germs, and Steel' Reconsidered \"In the Savage Minds discussions and elsewhere, the criticism focuses on whether Diamond has gone so far in focusing on the relative advances of some regions and countries that he is ignoring important distinctions in those regions and countries (poverty in Western nations, wealth in countries where most people are poor). Other critics say that for all of Diamond's efforts to combat racism, he has botched discussion of race, especially in Africa. And some of the criticism also notes Diamond's star status, sometimes moving into a mocking tone of the sort that professors almost always receive when they get their own television shows. And that part of the criticism has given fodder to some of those coming to Diamond's defense. Brad DeLong, for example, wrote that the Savage Mind s critics were an example of \"injelitance,\" which has been defined as \"the jealousy that the less-than-competent feel for the capable.\" He and others write that the critics haven't read Diamond carefully and misrepresent his ideas. One of the posts that kicked off the debate was by Kerim Friedman, who recently earned his Ph.D. in anthropology at Temple University. He started by focusing on the question that Diamond uses to frame his book. Diamond quotes a man name Yali whom he meets in New Guinea who asks him, \"Why you white man have so much cargo and we New Guineans have so little?\" It's the wrong question, Friedman writes. \"While it is interesting and important to ask why technologies developed in some countries as opposed to others, I think it overlooks a fundamental issue: the inequality within countries as well as between them,\" Friedman writes. \"I assure you that logging industry executives in New Guinea live better than you or I do! Both New Guinea and the United States are far more unequal (by some measures) than is India. Moreover, inequality throughout the world is increasing more rapidly now than every before. Although it is a contentious argument, economist Amartya Sen argues that inequality within countries can be more important than inequality between countries.\"\" ",
