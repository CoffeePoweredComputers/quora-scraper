            "answer_text": "The American Revolution was mainly about taxation. The colonists, some of them I should say, objected to the idea that they should pay taxes that they had no hand in approving because they didn\u2019t have representation in Britain where the taxes were enacted. Then, as is true in the present, there was a lot of rhetoric associating such lofty ideals as \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d with the issue of being required to pay taxes. But the main \u201cideal\u201d was that the moneyed class, the plantation owners, didn\u2019t think it was fair of King George to levy taxes on them, without a representative from the colonies being included in the decision to enact the taxes in the first place. It should be noted that the colonists were not all in agreement with the revolutionaries. Some of them were content to pay their taxes and thought that waging a rebellion against the King\u2019s authority was treason. Additionally, those who objected to the taxes did so because they thought that the taxes were unfairly punitive to them, not because they thought that they should not be required to pay any taxes at all. A culture has been constructed around the events of the American Revolution over the centuries, that paints the act as some noble stand for \u201cfreedom\u201d, \u201cliberty\u201d, and democracy. But the reality is that it was an act of rebellion for the most part, engineered by rich people who didn\u2019t think that they should be required to pay taxes. ",
