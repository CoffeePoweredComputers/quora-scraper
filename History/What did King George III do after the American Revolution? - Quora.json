            "answer_text": "George III was still in his 40s during the American Revolution. Again I don\u2019t understand the mythology that Americans surround George. It was Parliament that pulled the strings during the war. He is just a figure to hate?! George was on the throne for 60 years, although The last 10 he was a bit bonkers, so his son stood in as regent! He was king over many wars, across every continent. When he came to the throne the British army was fighting Seven Years war in Americas, Asia and Europe. After, the Revolutionary war he cracked on with the rest. The threat in Europe Was huge!!! Consolidating India and the new Far East and also the Caribbean. He was king when Britain defeated Napoleon. The Tevolutionary war was not hugely big at the time. It was not hugely profitable. Plantations in Jamaica added far more to the British coffers than all 13 colonies combined. The colonists didn\u2019t pay any taxes, after a time it may have been a relief. He had far bigger fish to fry than a corner of the Americas. Europe was about to go up in flames!!! ",

            "answer_text": "He kept on reigning. In 1811 his son was made regent as George III was no longer mentally capable of doing the job. He died in 1820. The majority of his nearly 60 year reign took place after the end of the Revolutionary War. He saw his eldest son and heir marry and become a father. He lived through the death of that child in childbirth although how much he registered we don\u2019t know. By the time he died he had a number of grandchildren including one named Alexandrina Victoria \u2026 who would go onto to overtake George III as the longest reigning monarch. She in turn was replaced by George\u2019s great-great-great-great-granddaughter Elizabeth II. ",
