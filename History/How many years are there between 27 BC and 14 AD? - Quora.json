            "answer_text": "1.There are two issues in answering this question:a.The concept of '0'b.The descending order of years in BC. 2. Since the concept of '0' was not reckoned while fixing the Christian era, that has to be reworked and 1 BC will have to be taken as '0'. Since BC is calculated in descending order, the year after 27 BC will be 26 BC. 3. a. Based on the above, assuming 1 BC as '0', the number of years up to 1 BC will be 25. The number of years up to 14 AD will be 39. (25+14). 3.b. If on the hand we take 1BC as it is, then 2 AD will correspond to 1AD. The number of years up to 1BC will be 26 and 13 up to 14 AD. Together the number would be 39(26+13). 4. To sum up, the number of years would be 39. ",
