The Ashoka was very fierce and cruel person and this quality intensified his aspirations to become a king. According to contemporary law elder son would get this opportunity. Ashoka was most deserving, that's what he thought, but as he was the youngest child of his family he could not fulfill his desire.

And his cruel nature prevail on everything and started beheading his elders brothers. You must bored where does kallinga came. Wait. One of his elder brothers took asylum in kallinga kingdom. Ashoka sent a message to release him immediately but King of Kallinga disobeyed this message. Which led them to declare the famous Kallinga war. And rest is history.. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. As I often point out, we know little of the Mauryas. To form a response to this question, one can only speculate. Kalinga was a part of the Nanda Empire of Magadha - this much is certain based on the Hathigumpha inscriptions commissioned by the noted Kalingan monarch Kharavela. Did Kalinga manage to assert its independence when Magadha threw off the yoke of the Nandas or did the Mauryas take over Kalinga when they usurped Magadha? If the former is true, then Ashoka\u2019s expansionist policy (and the policies of those who came before Ashoka) would surely have led him into a military adventure into Kalinga since Kalinga was a wealthy province partly due to its maritime trade connections with Southeast Asia. A conflict between Kalinga and Magadha would have been inevitable - either due to the Mauryan ambitions or Kalinga\u2019s alarm at a powerful, growing Empire in such proximity. If the latter, then the viceroys or governors of Kalinga probably sided with Ashoka\u2019s rivals who claimed the Mauryan throne in the civil war that ensued after Bindusara\u2019s death. Ashoka might have put off conquering a powerful state as Kalinga until he had consolidated his power in other parts of the Empire. ",
