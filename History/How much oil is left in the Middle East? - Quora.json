            "answer_text": "Back in the 1970s Sheik Yamani, the Saudi oil minister, commenting on oil shortages of the time said \u201c The Stone Age did not end because they ran out of stones.\u201d What he meant was that the Oil Age would end when something better comes along, not when oil runs out. No one knows how much oil remains in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is known to have oil resources near its border with Oman. The oil on the Omani side is produced and exported via pipeline to the Muscat area. The oil on the Saudi side of the border isn\u2019t produced or even much explored for two reasons. First, the Saudi already have sufficient resource developed to supply the available market. There is no point in spending vast sums developing more, at least not now. Second, an export pipeline, to stay in Saudi territory where it would be under Saudi control, would be extremely long to loop all the way around the UAE. There is oil found at the southern edge of the Empty Quarter in Yemen, but not on the Saudi side for the same reason. I have been told that same producing formations extends all the way to Ghawar, near Bahrain, hundreds of miles, mostly of empty sand. Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and other countries have undeveloped or under-developed hydrocarbons. There is no shortfall of resource. Some other answerers have written the oil market will disappear by 2050 or some other date. Others say future investments will cost a lot and not recover much oil. Maybe or maybe not. I started in the oil business in 1973 when global consumption was around 30\u201340% less than it is now. Prevailing wisdom at the time was that the oil age was over and we would be facing shortages of growing severity. Long term predictions like that are fabulously unreliable. I\u2019d submit one way for oil demand to fall supply reliability will have to fail making prices skyrocket and expensive substitutes economic. The other way is for some substitute to become so much more cost effective that oil just can\u2019t compete. On the supply side, virtually everyone has underestimated two things, 1) how much oil there is we haven\u2019t found yet, and 2) how much progress will be made in technology of oil recovery. Geologists have routinely forecast oil running out since at least 1920 which is the oldest such book I have. They\u2019ve been wrong for almost a hundred years now. The exploding oil production in the US, the single most heavily explored oil province in the world, that has come from fracking technology has reversed declines that began decades ago and were widely cited as the proof oil would run out. The US is now expected to be the world\u2019s largest producer within a few years and is back exporting crude, something that stopped in the 1970s. (Not a net exporter, though.) On the demand side there is technology that could displace oil depending on how things unfold. Solar power generation has gotten a lot cheaper, but is still quite expensive and highly unreliable, particularly at high latitudes where so much energy demand exists. Power storage technology, mostly batteries, is very expensive and relies on minerals the supply of which is far more precarious than oil. Maybe we\u2019ll get a huge breakthrough on that but when? Fusion energy has been just over the horizon since I was in high school. Biofuels are largely an expensive joke, a sop to farmers pretending to be energy or environmental policy. Plants just don\u2019t produce enough energy per acre even with intensive agriculture, to make much difference. Even if all the farmland in the world is devoted to energy production it wouldn\u2019t displace the fossil fuels we have now and people have to eat something. Oil has some advantages that are very hard to replicate. Oil is very portable and compact. The 85 kWh battery pack on a Tesla weighs 1200 pounds, 550 kg for metric people and will take the vehicle around 200 miles or 320 km. A petroleum fuel tank to take a vehicle the same distance, with the fuel inside, would weigh about 10\u201312% of that. That\u2019s why no commercial battery powered aircraft exist. Oil is easy to store and transport using tanks, pipelines, trucks or seagoing tankers. Eventually all those advantages may become less important or battery technology will advance enough to overcome them, but that\u2019s a long term prospect. I\u2019d submit there is a lot more oil in the Middle East and elsewhere than anyone can reliably predict will be needed even if oil demand continues to grow decades into the future, as it has almost every year since WW II. Economies there seeking to diversify are being smart as that\u2019s a long term program, too, but it\u2019s not a crisis. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s estimated that within 50 years or so, it\u2019ll no longer be profitable for the Arab States to produce oil, as the costs will greatly outweigh the gains. The reserves probably won\u2019t be depleted until around 2100, but by then oil will be completely irrelevant to humankind. The nations of the Middle East need to quickly focus on diversification if they hope to survive economically in the coming decades. Only Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan don\u2019t have oil as their top export. The UAE, meanwhile, is the best candidate for surviving a post-oil Middle East, boasting a diverse economy that makes the majority of its revenue off of taxes, aviation, tourism, and entertainment. While the somewhat small nation\u2019s economic model may not be viable for all Middle Eastern states, it can certainly work as a framework. Saudi Arabia is planning to diversify its economy through the vision 2030 program, which will most likely benefit the nation socially and economically. Other nations are ignoring diversification at the moment, probably because civil wars and terrorism are a more pressing issue. One thing is clear: diversification is urgent for the region. When the nations of the world turn from oil, any Arab powers hoping to subside off of oil will die. They will become the most authoritarian states in the world, led by brutal regimes trying to stave off the angry, poverty-stricken masses. When this inevitably fails, they will descend into anarchy and civil war, ultimately ceasing to exist as nations. ",
