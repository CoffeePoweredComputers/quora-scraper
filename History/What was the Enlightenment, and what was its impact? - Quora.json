            "answer_text": "What are the advantages of attaining Nibbana? There are significant benefits that one will experience through the pursuit and attainment of Nibbana such as: Increased and high degree of focusIncreased and high degree of concentrationImproved and high degree of memoryClarity of thought and mindAn Enlightened being will no longer experience any discontent feelings such as sadness, anger, frustration, irritation, annoyance, guilt, shame, fears, boredom, loneliness, shyness, jealousy, resentment, etc. An Enlightened being will have deep wisdom in which to conduct daily life. They do not argue, fight, or have any hostility. They are polite, kind, caring, friendly, calm, respectful, etc. They deeply understand what causes harm in the world and, thus, do not cause any harm through their intentions, speech, actions, or livelihood so no harm comes to them. An Enlightened being can create healthy personal and professional relationships. Because of these benefits and others, their mind and their life is peaceful, calm, serene, and content with joy for the remaining time of their life, their last life. Enlightenment is a permanent mental state. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-What is Nibbana? Nibbana is a mind free of greed/craving, hatred/anger, and delusion/ignorance/unknowing of true reality with the realization of non-self and dissolving of the ego. (More on non-self later in this book.) Nibbana is a purification of the mind. The mind will be peaceful, calm, serene, and content with joy having eliminated 100% of all discontentedness. When you have attained Nibbana, you will not experience anger, frustration, irritation, annoyance, guilt, shame, fears, boredom, loneliness, shyness, anxiety, sadness, stress, or other discontent feelings. You will have generosity, loving-kindness and compassion for all beings with deep wisdom in how to attain Nibbana. The mind will have a high degree of focus, concentration, memory, and clarity of mind. You no longer pursue cravings or desires but seek only what you \u201cneed\u201d in life, not what you \u201cwant\u201d. You will have trust in all beings. You will not blame others for the problems you face. A mind with Nibbana will have an unshakable calmness, steadiness, and be \u201ccontent\u201d or \u201csatisfied with what is\u201d experiencing no discontentedness. When you attain Nibbana you will clear out unwholesome thoughts, not cling to the past or future. You will be able to live clearly in the present moment. You will have a pure mind to conduct your daily life. A person who has attained Nibbana will have eliminated The Ten Fetters. Nibbana is achievable by all humans. Children were known to attain Nibbana as young as age 7 during the lifetime of Gotama Buddha. The more one understands and knows what Nibbana is and is not, the more likely they will be to attain this mental state. As you pursue Nibbana, you will be able to eliminate your cravings and addictions. You will be open and trusting of all beings and not see another as an enemy. You will not discriminate or judge others. You will not have a desire to always be \u201cright\u201d and argue. If these exist now, you need more growth and more inner development to fully awaken to the Enlightened mind. The pursuit of Nibbana is a gradual pursuit, a path towards a better life. It is also a life without suffering or discontentedness of mind. It\u2019s a higher state of consciousness that allows you to function in life with ease and smoothness. You clear the clouds of darkness that form judgment, discrimination, ego as well as, greed/craving, hatred/anger, and delusion/ignorance/unknowing of true reality which are \u201cThe Three Poisons\u201d of the mind. Gotama Buddha described that when one has attained Nibbana they \u201clay down the burden\u201d or \u201clay down the stress\u201d. This refers to the burden or stress of life and the carrying of unwelcome emotions, attachment, and cravings which produces discontentedness. Because one aspect of attaining Nibbana is to extinguish any and all craving, you must not also have craving and desire to attain Nibbana. When there is craving, there can be no Nibbana. Therefore, we pursue Nibbana as an interest and goal without craving nor desire. Craving, desire, and attachment are defined as \u201ca mental longing for something with a strong eagerness\u201d. Nibbana is not happiness as happiness is an impermanent feeling that you cannot maintain permanently. Gotama Buddha\u2019s teachings provide the mind with a path to Nibbana, a permanent mental state that is peaceful, calm, serene, and content with joy. Many feel the goal of life is to be happy but this is not possible, is an unrealistic goal and will only lead to further discontentedness when the mind cannot maintain the feeling of happiness long term. If the mind is not happy, it will move to sadness, anger, or worse. Happiness is a pleasant feeling and is considered discontent because of the nature of its impermanence since the mind cannot reside in happiness permanently. Happiness is a feeling that is part of the three aspects of a discontent mind. A discontent mind will experience painful feelings, pleasant feelings, and feelings that is neither painful-nor-pleasant. Happiness is temporary and will not last forever. When the mind is not happy, it will move to another feeling and, thus, the mind cycles through all these impermanent feelings continuing to be discontent. Happiness is based on certain conditions that cause the mind to be happy. When those conditions are removed, the happiness will be temporary and the mind will move to another feeling. The feeling of happiness is impermanent because it is based on certain conditions that need to exist to create the feeling of happiness in the mind. One who has attained Nibbana will have a permanent mental state of joy. Having attained Nibbana, the joy experienced is without conditions and not based on an impermanent situation, object, or experience and, therefore, is permanent. One can be happy without having the mental state of joy. To be joyful is a mental state, not a temporary feeling. Happiness can exist with ill will or hatred while the joyful mental state of Nibbana would not include ill will or hatred. A person who has attained Nibbana will not have ill will or hatred. Having attained Nibbana, the mind will be peaceful, calm, serene, and content with joy. This is a permanent mental state where the mind can reside. As you attain Nibbana, the mind will be peaceful, calm, serene, and content with joy. You will laugh, joke, and have fun but you will not allow the mind to dwell in happiness. You will laugh, joke and have fun but then be able to easily bring the mind back to the middle where the mind is peaceful, calm, serene, and content with joy. With your current state of mind, you might feel that a steady, calm, and stable mind free of greed, hatred, and delusion while dissolving the ego is impossible or unattainable. However, if you accept that these things are attainable, it is just a matter of learning, implementing, and experiencing this important change in your life. You can pursue Nibbana in this lifetime and the first step is making the decision that it is attainable and that you WILL pursue it. As you start to learn and implement the teachings, found throughout this book, you will notice positive results. Slowly over time, your life will improve as you understand and implement the teachings. You do not need to have belief, you will see the results when you implement the teachings to observe the truth. Believing in God is not required and this will not hinder you in the process of pursuing Nibbana. Just learn and implement these teachings because you know that they are helping you to create a better life for yourself and those around you. Nibbana is not a mystical and mysterious existence or a status of one being higher than another. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite. It\u2019s learning that greed, hatred, and delusion (\u201cThe Three Poisons\u201d) while maintaining ego leads to a life of suffering and discontentedness. Each person should make Nibbana their number one goal in life. By attaining Nibbana, all things are possible. Whether you would like to be a good partner, parent, friend, student, employee, boss, sibling, etc., the process of earning your own Nibbana or \u201cEnlightenment\u201d will enable you to fulfill all those roles, and any others you wish with a high degree of clarity of thought. Nibbana is attainable. You can do it. You will enjoy much more from life in the process of pursuing Nibbana. ",
