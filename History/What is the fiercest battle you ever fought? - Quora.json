            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A The biggest battle i had fought or you can say i am already fighting is regarding my relationship.. We loved each other since 5 years back both of us has utmost trust and presumed to be together for forever , But unfortunately a day came when we got seperated for 3 months, i was left with lots of sorrow and grief. At that time i was suffering from sort of financial crisis as i had quitted my job in TATA for pursuing my life golden dream UPSC CSE . We both have decided when the pre result will be announced she will tell her parents about me and after final selection we will be getting engaged, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t get qualified i got 93 number and the cutoff was 106 . The phase of untrust started in her mind that i am not takings our relationship seriously and i am not capable to clear this exam and also due to financial crisis i had joined a job in BPO sector , this boosted her wrong thoughts about me and she left me for 3 months . WAITING PHASE I really waited her every single time but my ego didn\u2019t let me to call her and the waiting period got extended. I had through belief on her that she would never going to leave me and trusted her atmost on this earth. Reconcilation phase Suddenly one night i got a text from a new number that i am missing you badly can you please call me , my heart is full of excitement that she had messeged me , tears rolled down from my eyes . Immediately i called her and asked her apology for things that i had done and we started our relationship back again. ILLUSION PHASE Everything is working fine between us and we used to talk regularly . But gradually I started observing behaviour changes in her like in way of talking , putting secrets between us , frequently telling uncommon incidents. Whenever i used to ask her why she is showing such behaviour she used to got angry on me . Finally the of 7 jan came , after returning from her college she started crying on phone call and started telling that she is cheating on me and i should move on and find another girl who will be better choice for me . I got suprised and shattered both at same time , tears are rolling down from my eyes i asked why are you saying this thing please don\u2019t say these types of word . If anything wrong you have done please tell me i will definitely forgive you for that fault but she didn\u2019t tell me anything and asked me to come back delhi and start my preparation . I was suffering from sort of illness that needed some more time to heal up and this process had been extended to 19 th of jan , the day i will never forget in my life , this day i had lied to my father that i am going back to delhi to give interview on a mnc company that i had recieved interview call from but actually i had not given interview because she had told me that her family will not accept a person from private enterprise ,so i decided to skip the call letter and ready to begin with my preparations. I requested her to meet me atleast once so that we can sort out the differences and issues between us but she didn\u2019t want to meet me , I literally begged her for metting one last time ,finally she agreed to meet . ENTRY OF THIRD PERSON IN HER LIFE I am so gald that she had given me a chance to meet her , i was awakened for whole night . Next day we are together i was very happy to see her but I observed that she was not so much glad to see me but i took the things casually. Suddenly i see a guy message on her what\u2019s app the guy named bargav had messged her , as i know the device password I opened the what\u2019s app and found that she used to talk a lot with that guy and also she used to message and send her pics to that guy , i was completely surprised , I didn\u2019t resist my self to ask her about the guy, she told me that he is her best friend and batchmate , i started thinking that whenever i used to ask her that why she stay online always , she use to tell me that she used to check status and group messages on whats app . I felt very low because i know she is telling lie to me and also she had no regret that she had lied to me . I told her to maintain a proper gap in friendship but she refused to maintain distance and told me that if I don\u2019t trust her then i can leave her because she is not going to maintain distance with that guy . I was completely shocked from her response but I really loved her , so I started compromise with myself. BURIAL OF MY SELF ESTEEM : From the day when I started to compromise myself for the sake of her happiness and to preserve our relationship was the day I started killing my self from being me as an individual. Now she started abusing me frequently and using slang words to make me feel guilty. Whenever i call her during her college hours she didn\u2019t respond to any message or call, and whenever i used to ask her she always give nonsense excuses. I had cried for her continuously for 2 months 8 days not even a single day had been passed without crying for her but she never cared for my unhappiness , she used to tell me that you are loser that\u2019s why you used to cry always for a girl and I deserve this place. Things are getting worse day by day , she knows everything that my civil services examination are about to come in 3 months but she never cared about the things that she is doing is destroying my emotions , my career and my self esteem. Caught red handed: One night I simply called her on what\u2019s app number at 11:44 pm but the number is going engaged, i have also the number of that person to whom she used to talk i called on his number that number is also engaged. After 20\u201325 min i called her back and asked her to whom she was talking and again she lied that she is talking with her sister, when i asked her for screenshot , she refused and started shouting on me and told me that she is not anymore interested in me amd she is happy with other person in her life . She want breakup and not want to continue our relationship I cried endlessly and i told her that I really loved her from bottom of my heart that\u2019s why i was trying my best to save our relationship but now it is more then enough to sustain the relationship because she don\u2019t care about me and she is happy in her life . So i had given her blessings for rest of her life and promised my self not go back in any circumstances and to bear all the pain for being lonely. Lesson learned : Never value any person so much that if that person don\u2019t remain in your life then you are not able to be happy alone .Always remember your mother had suffered from extreme pain to gave birth to you never try to hurt yourself.The power of relationship lies in those hands who care less.Always set goal achievements not girl achievement.Emotions and tears are priceless entity do not waste it on fake personsRespect yourself first then others will respect youNo motivational video is going to help you to get out of the pain only a single person and that\u2019s you is going to curb your situationAlways remember you are warrior and at last a message from my younger brother gives me immense potential to overcome from this situation that is   ",
