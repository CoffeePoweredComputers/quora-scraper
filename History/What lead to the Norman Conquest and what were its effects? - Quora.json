            "answer_text": "The Duke of Normandy (in France) William, had been promised the throne of England by King Edward the Confessor, who had lived in Normandy in exile before becoming King of England. When Edward died, King Harold, of the powerful Godwin family, was elected King (or nominated) by the Wittenagemot (some sort of high council of nobles). He was crowned by the Archbishop. Immediately, King William laid claim to the throne of England and began to prepare for its invasion. He amassed a fleet of dozens of longboats (like the Vikings use) and 7 000 soldiers. He then proceed to invade England by crossing the Channel, a feat of arms that is still admired today. King Harold had already defeated King Hardrada of Norway who was also trying to invade England from the North. He then marched south to square it with William. Unfortunately, he was killed by an arrow in the eye (which might be a legend) and William won a sound victory at Hastings. William was later crowned as William I at Westminster Abbey (since then, all English monarchs up to the present Queen Elizabeth II, have been crowned in Westminster Abbey). History will know him as William the Conqueror. The consequences for Britain were certainly important. Some historians have even claimed the Conquest was a cataclysm which created a wholly new England, for better or for worse. King William unified England as a whole country, whereas previously England was a collection of separate Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.The concept of feudalism was introduced in England. That is, you hold land from a lord and in return you pledge some type of service to him. This created the classes of lords, knights (who hold land in return for military service to the lord) and the serfs, peasants who were little better than slaves and could be bought and sold along the land.The Curia Regis (or King\u2019s Court) was set up by William and his Norman successors.The Curia Regis started the process of sending judges and other officials into the country for administrative (like tax collection) or judicial functions.The Curia Regis later split into different courts of law (notably during Henry II). These courts, applying a unified set of legal principles, throughout the country, created the common law (but bear in mind this process took several centuries). The common law is one of the greatest legal system being created, the other being Roman Law. The common law is perhaps the most influential system of law in the history of mankind. It is still applied extensively in UK, US, Australia, NZ, South Africa, India, and in the commonwealth countries. Principles such as trial by jury, right to silence, presumption of innocence etc. are the jewels created by the common law, and today they are universally accepted (in democratic countries at least).The Parliament of Great Britain was created by a Norman known as Simon de Montfort, some two hundred years after the conquest. Note that all legislatures in the world have copied to some extent the UK Parliament.From a sociological point of view, the highly stratified class structure of England, and which lasted for centuries (has it even gone ?), has been rightly or wrongly attributed as having its origins to the Norman Conquest. The Normans were arrogant, overbearing and despised the lowly Anglo-Saxons. Did this attitude permeate the whole country and been descended for generations ?From an architectural point of view, there are many things left by the Normans which you can visit today in both England and France (Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, Windsor Castle, Rouen Cathedral etc.)",
