            "answer_text": "In the Classic Period of the Maya zenith, a city-state was ruled by an ajaw, or, more fully, a k\u2019uhul ajaw (sacred lord). Sometimes the ruler might also hold the title kaloomte\u2019 (high king, or in some renderings, warrior-in-chief). The exact distinction here is not yet clear to scholars. Rule was usually hereditary. It most often followed a Salic-like principle of male primogeniture, but female rulers were possible and several were recorded by history. The king and the upper nobility were seen as embodiments of divinity; indeed, to ascend to the throne was to ritually receive within the royal person the god K\u2019awiil, a deity signifying kingship, flint, lightning, and vegetation. We believe that rule was essentially autocratic, though of course there must have been some delegation given the complexity and scope of the societies. Regnal names were often fierce \u2014 \u201cLightning Claw\u201d or \u201cJaguar Paw,\u201d for example. Kings encouraged a cult of personality around themselves, building and displaying many impressive monuments in their own likeness to detail the dates and natures of their conquests and other important events. They inhabited large palace complexes which passed through the dynastic generations, continually expanded and renovated over the years, and the royal families may also have held country estates or leisure camps far beyond the urban centers. An elaborate headdress was a mark of noble rank, along with copious jade and shell jewelry, ornamental dental implants, and garb made from the brilliant plumage of the quetzal bird, which the Maya hunted just about to extinction. The elites performed ritual dances wearing special plaster masks in the images of various gods. Royal burials, made beneath the great ceremonial pyramids, required sympathetic human sacrifice (especially of adolescents) and were provisioned with all manner of treasure and foodstuff. Not all kings were equal: the phrase y-ajaw (his lord) denotes a liege-vassal relationship between two city rulers. Marriage between various dynasties was used to cement alliances or to end wars, at least, and the princes of one city could be held as wards by the rulers of other cities to keep the detente. We know relatively few details about the structure of the broader urban society beneath an ajaw. Civics were closely tied to mythic stories and rituals, and included rigid class distinctions; there appears to have been a sort of upper-middle merchant class, with great plaza markets offering fresh goods from throughout the region, from pelts and cotton cloth to beads to stingray spines, and always vital salt. Musicians and artist-scribes were employed by the aristocracy. A career in diplomacy was possible. But most urban Maya were simply laborers. The class-system was enforced by cosmically derived moral codes and civil laws about which sorts of persons could own what sorts of property, and how much of it. Wartime captives for sacrifice or slavery were important markers of prestige and honor. Military expeditions would return home to proudly parade their quarry before king and country. Even the lower classes of the city must have derived some sense of pride from finely graven, colorfully painted images of their ajaw trampling a captive combatant underfoot. This is one of the most common themes in the public propaganda of the Classic Maya. ",
