            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Louis XVI made several mistakes that should be recognized, but it should also be remembered that he was operating not with hindsight, but based on what he knew at the time. For someone in the modern day, with access to Wikipedia, to describe how they\u2019d solve the problems of Louis XVI\u2019s reign is a little like giving the Persians at Thermopylae Uzis in order to help them defeat the Spartans; it simply isn't fair. For this reason I'll try to avoid using hindsight or any knowledge Louis would not have had. Otherwise this thought experiment isn't really useful, as we can only evaluate historical figures or events based on what they knew at the time. I'll also assume I start my reign when Louis\u2019s reign started in 1774. For starters, I would involve myself more directly with the affairs of state in general. This was one of Louis\u2019s big problems: he trusted his advisors too much. I'd begin by investigating the Kingdom\u2019s finances and putting men I think I can trust in charge of them, and I'd check to make sure they aren't corrupt. I wouldn't intervene in the American Revolution; you don't need hindsight to see the negatives to that one. This means that going into my reforms my deficit isn't as bad as it was. I'd still, however, have to crack down on the privileges of the nobility and clergy. I\u2019d still probably cll the Estates General but would support raising taxation on the nobility and clergy from the beginning. This alone, of course, wouldn\u2019t be enough; I\u2019d have to slowly develop reforms aimed at increasing the monarchy\u2019s power and lowering the influence of the nobility and clergy. I wouldn\u2019t make any individual step justify rebellion from either the First or Second Estate. Hopefully, this solves the financial issue. Hopefully at some point I can finalize my reforms by giving the Third Estate more of a voice in the Estates General. As for the problem of famine\u2026 I can\u2019t change nature. This is a common misconception about the Ancien Regime prior to the Revolution, that you had the King sitting on food while the people starved. No one person can waste enough food to starve an entire country; it simply doesn\u2019t happen. What this means is: the famine\u2019s coming, and I can\u2019t really change it. Even if I did cut down on royal expenses, that would lower the estimation of the Monarchy in the eyes of the upper classes, making them less likely to accept my reforms, which is bad in the long run. What I can do is oppose the free market policies Louis supported historically; create some amount of publicly funded grain(which I can do thanks to increased finances). I\u2019d concentrate this around Ille-de-France and then move out; it\u2019s most important to keep the people closest to you happy, after all. This will not stop the famine, but it will mitigate it and help the monarchy\u2019s image. A few things in regards to Marie Antoinette. I would not scrap her by any means; that would be disastrous for any relationship with Austria. The perception of her as wasteful is undeserved; animosity towards her was above all because she was Austrian. This is something I can\u2019t budge on, again to keep myself from looking weak. Finally, and most importantly: If there is a revolt, crush it. I would not under any circumstances use the Sans Culottes as an attack dog to force my will on my enemies. The liberal nobility tried to do that and it worked out terribly. Any challenge to rule of law needs to be nipped in the bud. So, if they try something like the Storming of the Bastille, I send in the Royal Army. This might even show the nobility how much they owe me to protect them. ",

            "answer_text": "Give them what they want firmly and decisively. They want the Estates-General to meet or they won\u2019t approve the taxes to get the country out of debt. Rather than say, \u201cI don\u2019t want them to meet. That\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d say \u201cOkay, they can meet and I will take their opinions into account.\u201d When the Third Estate wants to vote by individual rather than by order and have twice the number of deputies, for the reasons stated in Sieyes\u2019 \u201cWhat is the Third Estate?,\u201d listen to their opinions than say yes. When inevitably the Aristocrat and Church Estates put up a fuss, you can say say that it\u2019s either that or denying that the enlightenment has happened and that there are a great number more educated members of the Third Estate than there were the last time the Estates General met. You will then be able to tax the Aristocrats and maybe the Church. When they write out their complaints in the Cahiers de doleances, you are to read them and consult with the orders, which are now sitting all together, and explain that they are to help you come up with what is to be done, because you were unaware that such suffering was going on among the people of France, and get them to help you come up with solutions. If possible, do away with many of the heavily outdated distinctions between nobility and commoner (the nobles\u2019 Privileges), preferably in the middle of the night and possibly by seeding someone into the crowd who could start the ball rolling and get the nobles to give them up themselves. Hire commoners among your staff and ministers. Hire a physics tutor who will end up being an excellent Chief of Secret Police. Hire someone to modernize your tax system. Hire someone to work on a system to protect both the (probably very worried now aristocrats) and commoners. Make charity into a state thing. Make the army open to all. Make the lycee and universities open to all. Make jobs open to the aristocrats. If you keep the Revolution under your control and act like you know what you are doing, you can modernize France, stay in charge, pay off France\u2019s debts for the first time in generations (just sell off Louisiana to America, interest Thomas Jefferson in it, he was amusing to the salon folks before). Most of all actually act like you want to change things for the better for everyone in France. ",
