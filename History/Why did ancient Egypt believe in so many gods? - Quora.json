            "answer_text": "Imagine starting from zero- No culture, no religion, no science, no tools. Just a bunch of naked people waking up with the minds of infants and starting fresh. Humans wish to attribute motive and cause to everything. It gives us comfort. Intentional stance Now, look at how the rain usually arrives at certain times of the year and not others. It cannot be predicted day to day. It presages growth in the natural world on land. It makes rainbows. The tide works on a different schedule. It is nearly invariable and brings the smell of death when it retreats. It reveals when it recedes and conceals when it advances. Assuming you would attribute such phenomena to a god (which the Intentional Stance theory suggests you would), would you think the same personality was inspiring both? Now try more diverse ideas. You discover that, after a river floods your fields, the next crop is better than average. You see dead fish rotting and begin to sacrifice fish byproducts (bones and scales after you eat your fill) in your field, inadvertently fertilizing it. Your brother discovers that over generations the practice of sacrificing the weakest 3 sheep each season results in a stronger herd (culling and animal eugenics). Is the same God blessing you? Are these the same preferences? Or do you just figure that many gods like well themed sacrifice? If you think about it (or check the archeological record), monotheism is the historical late comer and requires more thought to settle on. ",

            "answer_text": "The religious system of Egypt developed gradually over time, and had a priesthood that was the genesis of their kings. The expressions of nature were reverenced and therefore since there are many expressions of power through nature and the animal kingdom, those were seen as a symbol of the divine in human life. The polytheism of ancient Egypt was naturalistic in its basis, therefore, with the exception of Akhenaton, the more the merrier. Certain shrines tended to dominate because of their historical importance, and from the royal families that arose from such places. It is thus obvious that monotheistic faith makes everything more simple, and eliminates the need for an elaborate priesthood with dependence upon magical ritual and incantations and a priestly class that alone had literacy and education. When the aleph bet with only 22 letters was invented, it made the need for scribes vanish overnight. While the Coptic Christian community were the most likely heirs of the Egyptian language, they also fought the pagan past as best they could considering the origins of their own faith, while introducing new cult aspects that rivaled the ancients. The George dragon slayer legend, for instance. A humble bacon seller becomes transformed into a super hero. What ancient Egypt did, and how they behaved seems primitive to us today, but they should be given credit for their respect for nature, which many modern people lack as they throw their cigarette butts and other trash out onto the landscape, to let the wind carry it into the oceans and to pollute the earth so that river water in Israel is considered the most polluted on the planet. They were not entirely without good points, as you might have thought. But their religion was sheer superstition and magic. ",
