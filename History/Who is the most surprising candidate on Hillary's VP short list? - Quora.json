            "answer_text": "I\u2019m extremely surprised you didn\u2019t even mention Bernie Sanders in that list.Yes I do agree, it is a long shot. But one must also agree it would be one hell of a ticket.Imagine the response of the crowd.Dems and Independents would go nuts.For at least a few days I can sure as hell say,people would stop talking about Trump. Like in any prospective ticket, There are pros and cons. Let\u2019s see them,shall we? Sanders is a Socialist. To many Americans, A Socialist refers to the Soviet Union and the remnants of the Cold war.But people do embrace programs like social security . It is not a social program?Many in the cable news media said Sanders was a fringe candidate. An Independent Senator from Vermont whom nobody knew.I\u2019m quite sure that opinion has been blown out of the water now.He might as well be more popular than Clinton among many sections of the people.He has no hunger for power unlike Clinton,So he is a perfect candidate for VP.Clinton didn\u2019t consider the VP option back in 2008 because she needed a bigger role. As most of us know secretary of state is more prominent than the VP in terms of governance.She should pick Elizabeth Warren/Bernie Sanders for a victory in November.",

            "answer_text": "All sanity aside, which seems to be the hallmark of this election, Clinton should step aside and nominate Warren for the presidency. Warren can then nominate Clinton for VP, an arrangement that\u2019s far more balanced. If Hillary is still determined to run for the presidency, she\u2019s going to need a showy, solidly-establishment VP \u2014 and no one in that short list fills the bill. This leak looks strategic. It makes you wonder more who\u2019s not on it. For those who are on it, it\u2019s Hillary giving them national exposure; something they can express their gratitude and loyalty for later. ",
