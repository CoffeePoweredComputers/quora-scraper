The 5 most militarily aggressive countries, called the P5(Permanent 5) have this power. These countries are :- United States of AmericaRussian FederationPeople\u2019s Republic of ChinaUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern IrelandFrench RepublicThis allows these countries to reject resolutions in the Security Council. Resolutions are documents which are created by the United Nations Committees which state a particular action to be taken or law to be formulated. Also, it is important to note that this power is only applicable in the Security Council. Also, a bit of advice: If you really want to learn about the UN and International Relations, you should do some MUNs ",

            "answer_text": "The Permanent 5 (P5) members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) are the US, UK, France, Russia and China. The Security Council has 15 members on it: the P5 and 10, non-permanent seats. These seats are voted on every two years (5 per year). To pass a resolution in the UNSC (Article 27, Section 3 of UN Charter quoted below): \u201cDecisions of the Security Council on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine member, including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VI, and under paragraph 3 of Article 52, a party to a dispute shall abstain from voting.\u201d (my italics) To interpret: to pass anything substantial in the UNSC, you need 9 votes and none of the P5 can say no. Even if the vote is 14\u20131, but that one is one of the P5, the resolution fails. That\u2019s the veto power in the UNSC. ",
