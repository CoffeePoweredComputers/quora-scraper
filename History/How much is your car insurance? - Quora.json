I need to know where i stand with insurance? basically a guy drove into the side of me and my car is in the garage awaiting assessment to see if its to be written off or fixed. of course the insurance wants whatever is cheapest and its looking like it would be cheaper to write it off. if this happens can i 1. offer to pay more on my excess to get it fixed? 2. get the car picked up and pay for it all myself to get fixed at my own mechanics? its not that the car isn\u2019t fixable its just that the insurance is looking at the cheapest option, which looks like writing it off, because my excess is so high, but if they do this i will never be able to afford the insurance, so would rather keep this policy and fix it, anyway is this possible and can anyone find a loophole?\u201d Cheap insurance companies for 17 year olds? cheap companies that offer cheap insurance for males Is it a requirement to let home insurance company before installing Trampoline in the backyard? my neighbor told me that it is very necessary to tell your home insurance company before installing trampoline in the backyard and after that they will raise your insurance rate.

            "answer_text": "My 2006 Scion xB with fairly good insurance for me and the car in Illinois, about $350 every 6 months. My 2003 Acura CL Type S with minimal insurance other than my bodily coverage which is the same as my Scions results in almost $600 every 6 months in Michigan. No damage coverage for the car. (Quoted for Illinois first, which the same coverage would have cost just under $200 for 6 months). Michigan has some of the most expensive insurance by the way! When transfering into Michigan, my agent actually asked if I was sitting down since before the discounts I was at almos $750 every 6 months for the Acura. Yikes! ",
