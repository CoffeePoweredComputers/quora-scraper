            "answer_text": "THIS IS WHAT HE'S REALLY DONE: This is a creature who\u2019s: \u2022\tMocked a man with disabilities. \u2022\tAttacked the parents of a fallen American hero. \u2022\tBelittled POWs and the war record of Sen. John McCain. \u2022\tLied about how much money he raised for veterans. \u2022\tCalled a former Miss Universe \u201cdisgusting\u201d and fat, telling his Twitter followers to find her non-existent sex tape. \u2022\tAccused an American-born federal judge of being unfit to do his job because of his Mexican heritage. \u2022\tLikely avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades. \u2022\tCalled most Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, even though that\u2019s not remotely factual. \u2022\tLied about seeing \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. \u2022\tLied about getting a letter from the NFL complaining about the debate schedule. \u2022\tTried to exploit the death of an African American woman in Chicago to say that\u2019s why black voters will support him. \u2022\tFound the \u201cbright side\u201d to tragedies because his poll numbers tend to go up. \u2022\tSettled with the Department of Justice after his company was found guilty of racially discriminating against minorities. \u2022\tHas cheated on at least one wife. In retrospect has been found to have cheated on all 3 wives multiple times each. \u2022\tWas discovered on video admitting that he not only tried to cheat on his current wife, but he attempted to do so with another married woman. \u2022\tHad his first wife publicly say that he did nothing when it came to raising their children until they were old enough to talk business. \u2022\tTweeted that women should have expected to be sexually assaulted when they mixed males and females together in the military. \u2022\tSaid he wants to target the families of terrorists. \u2022\tStated that he wants to ban an entire religion. \u2022\tPraised a Russian president who obviously hates the U.S. and Americans. \u2022\tEncouraged the Russian government to commit espionage against Americans. \u2022\tInsinuated that another Republican\u2019s wife was ugly. \u2022\tTried to implicate another Republican\u2019s father in JFK\u2019s assassination. \u2022\tSought out the help of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes after he was fired following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed women for years. \u2022\tMade Breitbart\u2019s Steve Bannon one of his top campaign people. \u2022\tHad a former campaign manager abruptly resign after a report came out linking him to pro-Russian groups that were directly trying to undermine U.S. policy in eastern Europe. \u2022\tCalled Carly Fiorina ugly. \u2022\tHas said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese \u2014 then denied saying it. \u2022\tWas a leading conspiracy theorist when it came to the racist-driven birther conspiracies against President Obama. \u2022\tDismissed nearly eight years of accusing the president of not being an American with a less than 30 second statement where he didn\u2019t apologize for any of it. \u2022\tTried to blame Hillary Clinton for his racism. \u2022\tRe-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. \u2022\tPlayed dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the KKK David Duke was. \u2022\tSkipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. \u2022\tHas, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. \u2022\tCalled a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man \u201ctrying to be the wife.\u201d \u2022\tHas said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. \u2022\tSaid he can\u2019t release his tax returns because they\u2019re currently being audited \u2014 even though the IRS said that\u2019s a lie. \u2022\tFeels he has the right to sexually assault women. \u2022\tLied, in the face of indisputable photographic evidence, about the size of his inauguration crowd. \u2022\tContinues to push the unfounded conspiracy that \u201cmillions of people voted illegally\u201d because his ego can\u2019t handle the fact Clinton received 3 million more votes than he did. \u2022\tDisgraced the CIA\u2019s monument to fallen agents by talking about his electoral college victory. \u2022\tAfter frequently criticizing President Obama for playing golf, has spent nearly half his weekends since being sworn into office playing golf at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. \u2022\tOn pace to cost taxpayers more on \u201cextracurricular\u201d expenses during his first 365 days in office than we spent on Obama during his 2,921 days as president. \u2022\tSettled a $25 million lawsuit accusing him of purposely creating a fake university to scam people out of money. \u2022\tHas already broken most of his biggest campaign promises. \u2022\tFired the head of the FBI for apparently not \u201cswearing loyalty\u201d and doing what he wanted in regards to the on-going investigations looking into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russians. \u2022\tThen threatened the former head of the FBI just after firing him in an attempt to intimidate him from speaking out publicly. \u2022\tPushed an unfounded conspiracy against Barack Obama, accusing him of ordering unconstitutional wiretaps placed in Trump Tower \u2014 without providing a shred of evidence to back it up. \u2022\tSeems to have been working with the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, to undermine congressional investigations into his possible Russian connections. \u2022\tHad said, despite promising to do so, he doesn\u2019t plan to ever release his tax returns. \u2022\tSaid he didn\u2019t know being \u201cpresident\u201d would be so hard. \u2022\tApparently needed the president of China to explain to him why dealing with North Korea is complicated. \u2022\tSigned two travel bans against Muslims that were overturned as unconstitutional. \u2022\tAllowed state-run Russian media to bring electronic and photographic equipment into the Oval Office \u2014 while denying entry to any U.S. press \u2014 at the request of Vladimir Putin. \u2022\tSaid his surrogates shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for the dishonest or contradictory things they say. \u2022\tAdmitted Australia, which has universal health care, has better health care than we do, then doubled-down on those comments, yet still supports a bill that\u2019s almost the complete opposite of their system. \u2022\tMonths after the election, continues to bring it up the electoral college, even hanging a large printout of it on a wall in the White House. \u2022\tDidn\u2019t mention the Jewish people once during his speech on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. \u2022\tBlamed Democrats for the initial failure of the House of Representatives being able to pass Trumpcare \u2014 even though Republicans have a 44-seat majority. \u2022\tIs now bragging about the very same jobs reports he called \u201cfake\u201d and \u201cphony\u201d prior to taking office. \u2022\tContinues to call the talk about the investigations into his connections to Russia \u201cFAKE NEWS!\u201d even though the FBI has publicly admitted these investigations are, in fact, real. \u2022\tHas the lowest approval rating for a president this early into their presidency \u2014 in history. \u2022\tAdmitted he lied when he publicly threatened that he might have recorded his conversations with the former head of the FBI he had just fired \u2014 in a clear attempt to intimidate James Comey into not speaking out about what the two men had discussed. \u2022\tApparently doesn\u2019t understand what \u201ccollusion\u201d or \u201cobstruction\u201d actually mean. \u2022\tCalled the very same health care plan he publicly celebrated and said he supports \u201cmean.\u201d \u2022\tLaunched a disgusting attack against \u201clow I.Q\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzeninski, accusing her of \u201cbleeding badly from a face-lift\u201d when he saw her back in January, while calling her co-host Joe Scarborough, and former U.S. congressman, \u201cpsycho.\u201d In Terms of positive , for the people and the country accomplishments ? the count thus far is ZERO, NADA, Nichts, Nothing, in round numbers : 0 The positive actual Achievements are all Negative . at the time of this posting I chose to list only the most eggregious 88, I actually believed at the time that that should have been enough to boot him out of office , in view of the claimed righteousness of the of the Republican Senate Majority. But you the reader of this can count just as well as can I and some modest diligent counting will find hundreds of instances of heretofore unacceptable and eggregious behaviors that actually warrant mandatory forcible expulsion from the OVAL OFFICE Are you really serious about looking for any positive accomplishments , other than being an disgustingly despicable Human being, you will not be able to find anything laudable worth mentioning.

Only 12 days later, President Trump announced that he would have run into that school even without a weapon! I quake with pride at just the thought of our President Trump rushing into the path of danger, despite being handicapped by those bone spurs!  Pity, we\u2019ll never know what difference his heroic entrance would have made, but I\u2019m sure he would say, \u201cAw, it was nothing\u201d. ",
