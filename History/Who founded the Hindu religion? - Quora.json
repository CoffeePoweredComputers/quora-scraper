            "answer_text": "Hindu itself is a foreign word. People who were living on the bank of Indus were called Hindus, and anyone beyond the river started to be called Hindus.  Indian philosophy has evolved over time, and its is the reason why it has paradoxes as well as receptive to future. I would like to highlight with few points below -  1. Read the Nasadiya Sukta in the Rigveda.. which is nothing but an example of atheism. Rigveda does not claims it knows all, or someone who would reveal it, but it only wonders - whether there is a higher power or is their a no higher power. 2. Ever heard of stories of how Rahu Ketu are troubling Sun & Moon god, causing eclipse. Well Aryabhatta lived in India around 476 CE and he explained how the eclipse occurred - precisely. While Hypatia the Greek astronomers was lynched by Christians, and Galileo was jailed by Vatican (there was a prevalent thought during middle ages in europe that Earth is flat). In Islam, in one of the Hadiths the Prophet advises to remember god during the eclipse (around 600 CE) and no other explanation was given. 3. Chandragupta Maurya became a Jain monk, while Ashoka became a Buddhist monk, religious belief was not adhered to much, but a way of life. These two sects largely adopted prevalent worship methodologies of Hindus, but again they were sect and not suppose to be a religious groups. 4. No religion explains the existence of dinosaurs, or evolution. Understand that Earth has million of years of history. 5. Only Indian (not attributable to Gods, but open scientific and philosophical debates) thought process comes close to the origin of the Universe as explained today by Science. Every religion denies Darwinian school of thought  (also our texts do not explain evolution), and claim that we all traced our ancestries to a single man and woman, who were exiled from Garden of Eden. 6. If you believe the concept of origin, you are free to accept the concept of death also. In Indian school of thought it is Moksha.. with no material body remaining, where as in other religion - it is eternal life in God's world. All would be around the same age - including children, and there would be no lack of food. I fail to understand the reason to stay for such an eternal life in God's place, and if that is the life we need, why not live the same here? Indian philosophy  has been amalgam of various cultures, and various culture took leaves out and tried to explain themselves by using their stories either to become part of a progressive civilization or to add them to their subjects. For example - even a simple cultural practice - Wedding differs from state to state in India.  Thus there is no single person who founded Hinduism. We have many schools - even Materialistic - and scientific development has to be applied before any of the thoughts have to be accepted if one is believing in God, and wants to be belonging to one of the classified labels  - Religion.

            "answer_text": "It was different sects of belief. Hindu word didn't exist till 1830. There was no Hinduism or Santana Dharma 4000 or whatever number of years about. It was different sects of beliefs. Word Hinduism and Santana Dharma is British and Brahmin invention in 19th century. Hinduism did not exist before 1830. It was created by the English colonialsts in the 1830s. This remarkable circumstance is evidenced by the fact that none of the travellers who visited India before English rule used the word `Hindu' or `Sanatana'. The Brahmins of India actively collaborated with the English colonialists in their conquest of India. As a result, the English rewarded them by inventing the designation `Leaders of Hinduism' for their loyal servants, their Aryan Brahmin cousins. All the invasions of India by foreigners were engineered by the Brahmins. They actively collaborated with the Portuguese, helping them to conquer large parts of India. The offices of the Mughal empire were full of Brahmin conspirators. A full one-third of the British Bengal army was Brahmin. Indeed, the answer to the much-asked question, `Why has Indian history been a series of invasions ?' is `The Brahmins engineered them !' - \" If the history of India is analyzed, it is revealed that the Aryan Brahmins have acted as the traitors through the ages. They also betrayed India to the Europeans. The term Aryans denote the group of people who came to India in different periods without any religion, \"-- [ Dev ] In this connection one need only remember that the Brahmin Canakya engineered the Macedonian invasion of India by Alexander the Great. Through his protege Candragupta Maurya, Canakya lured the Greeks deep into the Punjab. With the troops and mercenaries provided by Alexander, Canakya and Candragupta managed to overthrow the indigenous dynasty of Magadha and succeeded in imposing the first totalitarian state the world had ever seen : the Mauryan Empire. A few decades later, the Bactrian Greeks followed up on Canakya the Brahmin's open invitation, and annexed major parts of India. The creation of Hinduism, the subsequent formation of Sanatana Dharma and the propagation of these concepts is mainly due to vested interests with the following ulterior motives. Reward of Brahmin Collaborators - As shown above, the main motive in the English invention of Hinduism was to reward their Aryan Brahmin collaborators with an imagined leadership of all of Hinduism and by extension, all of India. Such were the services rendered to the British crown that not only were the Brahmins made leaders of India at that time, but the whole of Indian history was completely falsified to portray them as the `eternal rulers of all Hindus'.Dravidianism Suppressed - India obtained Independance from Anglo-Brahmin and Brahmin-Portuguese rule in 1947. However, the new state that arose was merely a neo-Brahminist casteocracy. One of the main `threats' to the integrity of the new Aryan Brahmin-ruled republic was the spectre of Dravidian Nationalism. The Sudroids (Dravidoids and Kolarians) represent the original inhabitants of India, who were later subjugated by the Aryan invaders. They form the overwhelming majority in Southern India, and strong demands existed for a separate Dravidian nation. Ambedkar and many others fought for recognition of the Dravidian Religion as separate from the Hindu religion, but M.K.Gandhi foiled these attempts, and succeeded in temporarily subverting the Dravidians in Hinduism. The British were reluctant to recognise the Dravidian religion, since it would have antagonised their Brahmin collaborators. This is one of the prime motives behind the invention of Hinduism.Vaishnavite Ambitions - Since the majority of `Hindus' were Brahminist Vaishnavites in any case, it was hoped that Vaishnavism would thus become a synonym for Hinduism, thereby subverting Shavism (Dravidian Religion), Smartism, etc. in one go.Christian Missionaries - The creation of Hinduism suited the missionaries who did not have to deal with any Indian theological system. Christianity historically made the greatest inroads in `pagan' (ie. religions lacking a developed sustem of theology) regions, while failing in areas where `devoloped' religions like Islam, Confucianism, etc. By creating Hinduism and submerging thereby Vaishnavism, Jainism, Buddhism, Saurism, etc. into `One Great Pagan Religion' they had to deal with `merely another pagan cult'. Hence, `Hinduism' served the interests of the Christian missionaries.English Imperialism - The creation of Hinduism entailed inclusion of the Negroid-Australoid Aboriginal Races of India as `Hindu'. Thus, English dominion in India was justified by claiming that it represented a pious mission to `civilize the pagan natives'.Aryanism Suppressed - English colonial rule was justified by the rule of `Whites' over `non-Whites'. Accepting the existence of `Aryans' in India would have meant a nullification of this justification, since a sizeable fraction of India's population would be `white' and would not require `white' Anglo-Saxon rule. The submergence of Indo-Aryans as `Hindus' served to suppress this menace to British rule. The early Arya Samajists realised this attempt to subvert the identitiy of Aryans. and staunchly opposed the use of the word `Hindu'; a move equally opposed by the British. By denying `white' status to Indo-Aryans (a fact since proven by genetics). the English justified rule over `non-whites'.Rajputism Suppressed - The Rajputs are descendants of the Scythians, Greeks, and other immigrants who entered India just prior to the rise of the Indo-Islamic Caliphate of Delhi. Throughout their history they followed their Solar religions (`saura' cults), independant of any Aryan Vaishnavite Brahmans. Yet the invention of Hinduism served to subvert Saura religion as well.Smarta Subversion - The creation of Hinduism suited the Smartas (Advaitins) most of all, since their religion was defined in terms of giving equal worship to 5 major gods of India, as well as a whole host of others. It remained a very minor religion in India, having been propagated only by Sankaracharya and being localised mainly in Kerala. The overwhelming majority of Hindus were (and still are) Vaishnavites (more than 75 %). However, the definition of `Hinduism' was essentially Smarta, and by propagating `Hinduism' the Smartas hoped to submerge their old rivals the Vaishnavites.To summarise, realising that Hinduism was in fact an English invention; this circumstance becoming widely known and the cause of much satire on `Hinduism' and its English invention, the Brahmin Vaishnavas invented the term `Sanatana Dharma' in order to counter these difficulties : Faced with this dilemma, Hindu scholars sometime use the word Sanatan Dharma (eternal religion) and sometime Vedic Dharma (religion of the Veda), etc. for their religion. But as names of their religion, these words are also untenable as they do not imply anything precise for all the people called Hindu. ",
