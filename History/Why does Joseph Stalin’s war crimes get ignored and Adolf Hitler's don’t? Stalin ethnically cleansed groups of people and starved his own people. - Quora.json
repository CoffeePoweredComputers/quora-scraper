            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think Stalin\u2019s crimes are ignored at all. Actually there\u2019s extensive academic literature about his \u201creign\u201d, some exclusively dedicated to the atrocities he ordered, such as, for example, the Holodomor or the great purges. One of the first reliable reports is Solzhenitsyn\u2019s The Gulag Archipelago. The subject remained a taboo in the West and in soviet circles almost until the downfall of the regime. The way I see it, it was similar to the case of North Korea nowadays. Everyone knows what\u2019s going on in there, but we will only get to know accurately when the regime crumbles. Although Stalin was indeed an anti-semite (this can be confirmed in several of his declarations) the state repression policies never really established prosecution based on ethnicity, not during Stalin\u2019s era, nor before, or after. For example, one could be arrested for disapproval of the nature of the regime, or pretty much for disagreeing with anything, but this would not be based on a racial or ethnical criteria. One\u2019s offspring would not be denied the right of existing for being part of a ethnic group. Quite the contrary, it was common for the regime to \u201creeducate\u201d children of convicted \u201ctraitors\u201d of the regime. Children were taken in and molded to become \u201cchildren of the regime\u201d. The idea was to promote denunciation of \u201cillicit practices\u201d, like children denouncing their parents and so on (Pavlik Morozov\u2019s case, probably fabricated by the regime, and other similar ones). Basically, the soviet regime stated \u201cif you think this way and disagree with us, you do not have the right to live because you\u2019re a traitor. You must die because of your beliefs and actions\u201d. Comparing with Hitler\u2019s nazi regime, one would be condemned for belonging to a certain race of ethnic group (adding also the dimention of politically disagreeing with the regime). Something one couldn\u2019t really control or choose for is part of one\u2019s self by nature. Children of those deemed to die would have the same fate as their parents because that specific race or ethnicity does not have the right of existing (unless the race in question was \u201cthe master race\u201d, in that case one could have that privilege). Basically, the nazi regime stated \u201cif you belong to this race or ethnicity you don\u2019t have the right to live. In fact, you shouldn\u2019t even been born, because you don\u2019t belong to the human species. You\u2019re a demi-human, you\u2019re inferior, you\u2019re a nature mislapse\u201d (look up the Nuremberg Laws 1935). It goes beyond one\u2019s beliefs. Both brutal totalitarian regimes, although ultimately different in nature. When it comes to being \u201cignored\u201d I believe that is entirely wrong. To study one phenomenon doesn\u2019t mean ignoring all the others. That is like saying \u201cif you study the romans that means you\u2019re ignoring the greeks\u201d. That is a bogus attempt to politicize the subject. This is not about politics is about history. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cOne death is a tragedy, a million is statistic\u201d Keep that sentiment in mind. During WWII, the atrocities of the Nazis were well documented and spread across the world. When it came to the USSR, such stories are few and far inbetween, and the Nazis certainly out did them in terms of how methodical their genocidal campaign was. The Soviet\u2019s purge was ad hoc, dirty, and messy. People were dragged into the streets, shot and burried in mass graves. The Nazis on the other hand, had documented inhumane experiments, and did everything so methodical that it a lot of people find it unnerving. So that\u2019s one reason why the Nazis receive more infamy than the Soviets. The next reason is how each portrayed themselves. The Nazis displayed themselves as the Ubermensche, destined to take over the world and usher in a natural order and eugenics. These things were blatantly pro-glory and anti-freedom, so obviously it\u2019s not going to go down well with modern audiences. The Soviets on the other hand portrayed themselves as overthrowing the corrupt wealthy elite, and giving power \u201cback\u201d to the poor. The Soviet\u2019s message was equality, no rich, no poor. It sounds like a utopia where everyone gets just what they need, and everyone works hard. Of course as we all know, a utopia is impossible. But humans in general are not logical creatures. Humans like emotions and stories, and the stories of the Soviets toppling the rich is far more palatable than the Nazi\u2019s story of purging the Jews and creating a race of supermen. PragerU did a good video on this topic as well  ",
