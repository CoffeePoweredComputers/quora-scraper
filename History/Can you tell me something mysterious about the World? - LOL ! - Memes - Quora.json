            "answer_text": "With all our modern technology, it is easy to assume that we know everything. With a few swipes of our finger, any of us can view detailed photos of the surface of Pluto or take a Google Street View tour through Antarctica\u2019s McMurdo Station. Truly, the age of mystery is over. Or, is it? In spite of all our miraculous tech, we\u2019re still a long way from understanding even some basic things about ourselves. Let\u2019s face it, I want to have sex with my wife but no idea if she too feels the same or it\u2019s just a part of her relationship role that she plays. So, it's so complicated to understand her love and her obligation towards the man she lives with. So, for me, the woman is the mystery in this world, so mysterious that even the most intelligent man of that time, Lysimachus of Acarnania and Leonidas warned Alexander the great about the mysterious species called \u201cwoman\u201d just before he was on his course to conquer the world. Next, when I think about the mysteries, I think about what makes me think and that is my mind, my brain, my body ..oofs\u2026 we are as mysterious as anything else. Of all the objects in the universe, the human brain is the most complex: There are as many neurons in the brain as there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy. So, it is no surprise that \u00addespite the glow from recent advances in the science of the brain and mind, we still find ourselves squinting in the dark somewhat. Why even so popular, rich, and famous personalities and even those who had been authors of bestselling motivational books commit suicide? What could have been their last thinking before they attempted to end their own lives? There is no rational sense in superstitions, but they exist. Isn\u2019t it paradoxical? Why some most intelligent people in the world believe in such illogical practices? All religions teach the highest standard of morality then why mostly religious gurus, Moulvis, priests, and fathers at churches are found involving in so many crimes ranging from rape, sexual molestation, fraud, and cheating, etc? Our great mysterious human entity!!! ",

Therefore, sage Vasishtha told Sri Ram Ji. All that we see with eyes and senses does not really exist, they are play of conscious mind. Remove the Grip/ Vail of the formless Mind( God) you can be aware of your true self and attain immortality. ",
