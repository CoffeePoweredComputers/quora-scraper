            "answer_text": "1. Have more capital than you need. 2. Keep your costs low (short answer with epic elaboration: use ingredients/materials to their fullest [i.e. day old donuts/rolls go into bread pudding,etc], find a location you can afford, don't hire friends or people out of charity, shop around for suppliers, etc)3. Don't hang your apron on one product. Just because cupcakes are hot not doesn't mean they will be next year. Offer other items. Just because someone else is doing it doesn't mean it's working, profitable or done right. Look for a hole in the market and see if you have an opportunity there.4. Know your strengths and what makes you different. Exploit that. 5. Hire people who are better and smarter than you. Every baker has a weakness. If you can't make a great cheesecake/pie crust/gingerbread cookie, etc, find someone who can. BONUS ANSWER: 6. Brides are completely insane. Unless you have endless amounts of patience and/or a friend in the liquor distributing industry you can call at all hours for therapeutic materials you will also go insane. If you're going to work with brides DRAFT A CONTRACT. ",
