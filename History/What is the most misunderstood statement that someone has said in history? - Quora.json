            "answer_text": " Famous Quote: \u201cGood fences make good neighbors.\u201d Privacy is the theme this Robert Frost quote and while the phrase \u201cgood fences make good neighbors\u201d is not quite so famous as some others (though you\u2019ve certainly heard it), Mending Wall Is one that needs to be included for one simple reason: it\u2019s misunderstood by federal law. \u201cSeparation of powers, a distinctively American political doctrine, profits from the advice authored by a distinctively American poet: Good fences make good neighbors.\u201d That\u2019s United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, literally creating hard law from thin air, and not understanding the thing he\u2019s talking about. Mending Wall does include the line \u201cgood fences make good neighbors,\u201d but it also paints the character speaking that line as a bit of a twit. \u201cSomething there is that doesn\u2019t love a wall\u2026 (nature) sends the frozen groundswell under it.\u201d The poem tells a story of two neighbors with a wall between them, but every winter the wall falls apart, so the neighbors have to meet and mend the wall, spending more time together than they otherwise would have and growing increasingly frustrated with the each other. Remember that the Supreme Court has nine justices, and at least one (Stephen Breyer) actually pointed out the error in his concurring opinion, but Scalia decided to leave the mistake in anyway. Breyer dissent:\u201dAs the majority invokes the advice of an American poet, one might consider as well that poet's caution, for he not only notes that \u201cSomething there is that doesn't love a wall,\u201d but also writes, \u201cBefore I built a wall I'd ask to know/ What I was walling in or walling out.\u201d R. Frost, Mending Wall, The New Oxford Book of American Verse 395\u2013396 (R. Ellmann ed. 1976).\u201d Ed PLAUT, et ux., et al., Petitioners, v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC., et al. ",

            "answer_text": "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. Most people believe that saying \u201cOh my God!\u201d is a sin against one of the 10 commandments. But the more you look at it from this perspective, the more petty and silly this commandment sounds. But the inherent commandment isn\u2019t that superficial, at least not as superficial as thought of to be. People mistake this commandment for swearing, a lot. What the commandment actually means: Not to make vows and commitments by God\u2019s name (as the witness) so lightly.To claim that your own will and actions is God\u2019s will.Which means things like Wedding vows, swearing in as President, preaching, etc, are all potential acts of breaking the commandment. \u201cThou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain\u201d essentially means; \u201cDon\u2019t say God said it when he didn\u2019t\u201d and/or \u201cDon\u2019t make false promises and use God as a witness.\u201d It\u2019s a commandment a lot of Christians hypocritically break a lot more than they think.
