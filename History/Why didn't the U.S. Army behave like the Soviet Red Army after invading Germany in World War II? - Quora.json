PHOTO BY NATIONAL ARCHIVES OF CANADA/ALEXANDER MACKENZIE STIRTON I assume you are referring to the almost 2 million German women raped by the Soviets. Antony Beevor describes it as the \"greatest phenomenon of mass rape in history\", and has concluded that at least 1.4 million women were raped in East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia alone. According to Soviet war correspondent Natalya Gesse, Soviet soldiers raped German females from eight to eighty years old. Why did the Soviets engage in such atrocities? They were encouraged by Stalin. Essentially he said to let them have a little fun. They had fought hard and deserved it. There were no consequences. US soldiers also engaged in raping German women. But not close to the Soviet numbers. US soldiers knew that if they raped a German woman, they would be arrested and tried. One author put the number at 190,000. So some US soldiers did behave like the Soviets. Why not more? They were not encouraged by their leaders like the Soviets. There were consequences because some of the US soldiers were criminally charged. Book Claims US Soldiers Raped 190,000 German Women Post-WWII - DER SPIEGEL - International ",
