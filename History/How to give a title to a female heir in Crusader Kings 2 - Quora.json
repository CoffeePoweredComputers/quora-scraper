            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t grant a female a title without the correct culture/laws/religion, as the medieval period was full of misogyny. Women could only ever inherit if there was no valid male candidate, and even then only in some of Europe. In the Islamic world, women straight up couldn\u2019t inherit (for more reasons than misogyny - the Iqta system isn\u2019t quite comparable to feudalism, and inheritance was a lot shakier and uncertain for vassal lords). However, if you are culturally Basque, have the right laws with the Conclave DLC, or are religiously Cathar (a Catholic heresy), women can inherit equal to men - I believe, but am not certain, that this also means that women can be granted titles, but I am not sure. There is also the Holy Fury DLC, which makes it so that if you reform a Pagan religion, you can take the religious trait Enatic Clans, which makes women primary title holders; it is basically a fancy way of saying that it makes followers of that religion follow a matriarchal, rather than patriarchal, system.

            "answer_text": "You need to have an absolute cognatic succession law.  No other allows titles to be given to females.  Agnatic-cognatic gavelkind/primogeniture/ultimogeniture, elective, tanistry, etc. allow female heirs but don't allow women to be granted titles in their own right.  Under these laws women can fill certain council positions (Spymaster is one) and be granted certain ceremonial titles, but never be granted a title until they inherit. ",
