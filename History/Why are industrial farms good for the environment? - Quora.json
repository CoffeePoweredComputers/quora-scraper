            "answer_text": "They are not good for the environment at all. They may emit fewer GHGs per unit of production compared to organic - this is the case for chicken. However, life is miserable for the animals involved and is sickening when it is reported by PETA and the like, even in non-abusive factory farms. It is also pretty obvious that given a chance, animals would not want to die young. But what\u2019s to do? Human are alpha preditors and we need protien. There is simply not enough land of the right kind to grow vegetables for all of us instead. Perhaps we can farm the sea bed but this is not in place and it has many risks and unknowns to resolve first. Perhaps organic farming techniques can be made lower GHG. Perhaps the use of cattle and other ruminants can be managed so they emit fewer GHGs as well as they work for us and make manure that we should use. I don\u2019t really have a problem with the toxicity of GM foods and I am not afraid of a super virus being created by accident. I am confident these things have already happened naturally lots of times and we\u2019re still here. As it is, one of the most toxic organisms in the entire world is plentiful in garden soil - Clostridium botulinum Botulinum toxin - Wikipedia The human world needs 35 billion meals a day. We now have the lowest nutrition and starvation rates in human history and many of us are overweight or obese. But the situation is not sustainable. Only 10% of food is factory farmed but it shares the emissions burden with the remaining 90% of small holder farms. About half of all factory farmed food does not make it from gate to tummy (I mean \u201cgets eaten\u201d not \u201cleft on plate\u201d). Whatever the solution, it is needed now, and at large scale and it probably can\u2019t be high tech (because of unintended consequences). ",

            "answer_text": "I think you need to check the source of your information. The Industrial farms are not at all good for the environment. They have less diversity, more intensive use of energy and other inputs, thus per unit output they have much bigger negative footprint on environmental parameters. ",
