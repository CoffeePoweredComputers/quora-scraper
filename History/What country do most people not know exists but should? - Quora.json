            "answer_text": "I have a few favourite, obscure countries that are on nobody\u2019s radar, normally. People will usually not be sure where they are, and sometimes, that they exist. Some of them are dependencies or territories of other countries, but with such strong identities that they might as well be countries. Here the ones I have always been fascinated by, and why: Bhutan. A fascinating, Buddhist country in the Himalayas that takes a very cautious view of the western world, and is led by a British educated king who is determined to keep the place happy.Mauritius. An island country with every aspect of loveliness, and if you\u2019re honest, you\u2019re not sure where exactly it is, are you?Oman. An apparently very peaceful, friendly, and fascinating country of the Arab world you never ever seem to hear about. I would quite like to travel there some day to experience it.New Caledonia. A surprisingly substantial land mass in the Pacific with strongly French influence that looks like it could well be worth a visit, or even moving to.French Guyana. A country-sized part of France in South America that is actually EU territory (EU citizenship holders need no visa to live and work there), and the best bit is that the European space programme operates from there. Rockets and palm trees. How cool can it be.Azores. They belong to Portugal, and have the perfect climate, in my opinion. Always around 20\u201325 Celsius, and when you see the landscape, you\u2019ll drop dead. It is unbelievably scenic. Imagine New Zealand with southern European architecture and lifestyle.Faroe Islands. An island state between Scotland and Norway, with strongly Scandinavian vibes, but enough proximity to Great Britain to make for a bit of hybrid experience of the two. This one is looming large on my travel list.Malta. An English speaking island that is part of the EU, has a fascinating language and history, and comes across as a blend of southern Europe and the Middle East.Uruguay. A small and proper, quite high performing country in South America that has historically often been labelled as the \u201cSwitzerland of South America\u201d. It has been producing a steady stream of interesting writers and thinkers, and my personal idol, Jos\u00e9 Alberto \"Pepe\" Mujica Cordano, the \u201cworld\u2019s poorest president\u201d.Paraguay. Probably the world\u2019s mellowest country, with a fascinating history of a long line of eccentric and seclusive presidents who kept the country pretty much isolated for centuries, and thus contributing to its uniquely calm spirit and atmosphere.Belize. Remarkable for being Central America\u2019s only English speaking country.Martinique. An actual part of France in the Caribbean, with representatives in the parliament in Paris. Living there means living in France, but with Caribbean ambience. And as an EU citizen, you can just live there.Guadeloupe. Like Martinique.Tahiti. Like Martinique and Guadeloupe, but in the Pacific.And then you get others that are fascinating, like Brunei, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Israel, Namibia, Madagascar, Madeira, Fiji, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Andorra, San Marino, the Vatican, and so on, but they are probably more known to most people.

            "answer_text": "Probably most small island nations in Oceania. Some examples include Nauru, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Those are relatively small and of no geopolitical significance, so most people ask \u201cwhere is that\u201d when you mention them And why should you know them? Well, I don\u2019t see why you shouldn\u2019t know them. For Taiwanese, for example, I\u2019d assume Nauru and Tuvalu are somewhat more relevant, because they actually recognize the ROC as the legitimate government of China instead of the PRC. But again, whenever you need to know them or not depends on you. Some African nations such as Malawi and Benin are also somewhat unknown to most people that do not have interest in world geography or something similar ",
