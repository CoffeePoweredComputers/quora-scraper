Not sure that Stalin regarded his son as a traitor \u2014 he is said to have remarked to a fellow member of the Stavka \u201cYakov will not betray his Motherland.\u201d But of course the same views would not have been held by many Russians who considered that anyone who did not \u2018go down fighting\u2019 was a traitor.
