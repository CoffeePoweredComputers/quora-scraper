            "answer_text": "I think they regret it. They were naive about the intentions of NATO (as if NATO is a peacekeeping force, and not just the instrument of imperialist world domination..). But also it was a strategic error of Libya to think that it could protect it\u2019s sovereignity, while not being armed to the teeth and without a nuclear or chemical arsenal. DPRK nows better then this, and make their military their top priority, and develop nuclear missiles to be able to protect their sovereignity. One of the reasons NATO and the US wanted to get rid of Khadaffi was because the Libyan government paid other african countries to keep AFRICOM out of their country. The US wants to have a toothhold in Africa to be able to withstand Chinese influence in Africa. ",
