            "answer_text": "Rome had a tactic which it used over and over again.The Romans would monitor wars.Then they would offer treaties of alliance and friendship to the weaker or defeated side.The weaker side side seeking a strong \u201cprotector\u201d would naturally accept.And thus Rome would take it under its \u201cprotective wing\u201d.Sometimes the \u201cprotected\u201d state would wise up and try to get rid of its protector-at which point the legions would move in to show it just how protected it was. Anyway,around 200 BCE,Philip 4 of Macedonia was exerting a lot of pressure on the Greek states.The weaker Greek states asked for Roman help.The Romans,professing a love for Greek culture responded positively and dispatched Titus Quinctus Flamininus to settle the issue with Philip whom Rome feared and hated anyway.(He had supported Hannibal when the latter invaded Italy.)Following some complicated manouvering,Flamininus brought Philip to battle and defeated him at Cynoscphele.(197 BCE).The next year at Corinth he declared Greece free of the Macedonian tyrant.Macedonia,incidentally was actually a Greek state itself but the irony was lost on the freed Greeks who regarded Flamininus as a saviour. Then things got interesting.The Greeks,it turned out,had simply exchanged one master for another and naturally they resented their new status.Philip may have been bad but at least he was a Greek too.Some began to grumble and make noises about restoring their ancient liberties.Rome let the Greeks grumble for awhile but after destroying Macedonia completely in 2 subsequent wars (168 BCE,148 BCE),it decided to settle with the recalcitrant Greeks,After the Achaean League revolted against Roman authority, Lucius Mummius,the Roman commander, besieged Corinth, the League\u2019s leading city.Then he sacked it,massacred most of the inhabitants,and sold the rest into slavery (146 BCE).The Senate then forbade its reconstitution as a Greek city.(Julius Caesar did,however ,re-constitute it but as a Roman colony.)The Greeks got the message and gave Rome little further trouble.Formally Greece was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 146 BCE as the province of Achaea.

            "answer_text": "I want to mention some thinks: 1.That time Greece was a wicked country because of the continued, for centuries, wars. In the country there was a lot of women and very small number of men. 2.Greek empire was not in reality one, but four. This four empires prefered to fight each other, rather than fight the Romans. 3.The Roman army who invaded in Greece 194 bC was not only Roman but in a big percentage Greek. There was some thousands of Greek hoplites from Etolia, Peloponisus, magna Grecia, even Greeks from Marseilles! Conclusion: Greek hoplites concorded the Greece, joining the legions of Rome. Rome was victorious over a depopulated Greece. The Greek world was a divided world, fighting each other. If the Romans would had invated in Greece the time of the Persian wars 490 bC, or the time of Pericles 400 bC, or the time of Alexander 330 bC, or the time of Pyrrus 270 bC, the Greeks defenetly would had pushed them back to the sea.

Greece was already in heavy decline at that time and with every little kingdom having different interests they did not stand a chance. But the ancient Greek culture influenced Rome a lot and I would generally say it was not a very hostile relationship between the two. ",
