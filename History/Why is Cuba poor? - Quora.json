            "answer_text": "Cuba used to produce only two goods: sugar and tabbaco. None is very fundamental. After the revolution, rich people in control of the US wanted Cuba to fail. They tried to assesinate their leader many many times. After all failed, they figure that it was a very small island that produced tabbaco, so they created an economic blockade. What this means is that while it\u2019s possible to comerce with Cuba, anyone who does it will have a very hard time comercing with anyone else. The small island become bad bussiness for anyone, and trading with them would black list you.Yet Cuba rearranged it\u2019s economy to produce for all of it\u2019s needs. It recieved a lot of help of the soviet union. The URSS would trade for the goods the island couldn\u2019t produce. But since the soviet union fell, things become pretty rough. Cuban\u2019s eat most of their fish, and most of the cattle. Food become very difficult to get. They can\u2019t get much technology since they\u2019d have to produce every part of it themselves. They run out of many things.With that in mind, it should be said that all the other islands that are neighbors to Cuba, are really much much worst in comparision. It\u2019s unluckly that any other system could have live that long with such a blocade. Cuba\u2019s numbers of malnutrition and scholarity are even better or similar to those of huge countries like Argentina and Brazil.Over the years almost the majority of the countries of the UN have voted to lift the killer blockade, and while they won every year, it really doesn\u2019t matter because the US have special privilegs and doesn\u2019t have to accept the ruling of the majority.
