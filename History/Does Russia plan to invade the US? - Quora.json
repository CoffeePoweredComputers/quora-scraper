            "answer_text": "This is insane the top post puts it best except in reverse. At no point has Russian federation threatened U.S, accused it of orchestrating anything or encroached on US borders . Claimed US to be a risk to world peace, its president a murderer criminal or thief. Or called for embargo due to US unjust hostile action towards other nations. Of which there has been plenty. The few flybys are an ordinary activity both nations engage in. No one in Russia of sound mind have proposed an attack on U.S. In the last 30 years\u2026 Let alone supported it. U.S. Is only mentioned as some geo political adversary that would likely be more hostile and assertive if it wasn't for level of defense Russia maintains. Battling US is never a topic of debate, or sane possibility\u2026 Us future leaders debating how they going to bomb other countries when in charge is not a popular topic as well. ( North Korea and US are simular in this ) It would be viewd as political suicide to promote war as electoral platform in Russia. The opinions about Russia mostly come from Hollywood, politicians creating enemies and old Cold War material\u2026reporters that know that slendering Russia, its people or leaders is a good way to score cheap points with audience. In Russia however Us isn't viewd as enemy dispite all negativity we see directed at us, still it is viewed as a stubborn, high-strung partner.. Occasional hypocrite, but still long term partner. Russians despite what is portrayed by Hollywood don't fatishise wars with others\u2026 The culture of \u201ctheoretical war\u201d non present .. It's substituted by history books. Currently, only one nation is capable of attacking anyone, any country at a drop of a hat with very little reason ( and has done so) and is potential risk to just about any nation from this stand point. It is not Russian federation. ",

            "answer_text": "Not militarily. Russia is in no position to do so. Russia's biggest issue is its size, diversity, the resulting insecurity of its borders and corresponding need to expand and co-opt bordering nations for use as buffer states. It also has failed to diversify economically, relying primarily upon energy exports for its trade, and its population is shrinking. Since global energy trade is denominated largely in dollars, and the dollar is rising and will continue to for the foreseeable future, this adds insult to injury as far as low global oil prices contributing to Russia's decline. Russia therefore seeks to attack the US by aligning with others to weaken or break the dollar-as-global-reserve juggernaut. This is likely doomed to fail, as the US Navy controls global shipping lanes, and therefore global trade flows by extension.  Geographic reality can't be entirely overcome with monetary machinations.

            "answer_text": "No. Just no. An attack on the mainland USA would likely result in a nuclear response to the attackers homeland. However even if we take out the nuclear card the logistics would be a nightmare because of the location. First of all they couldn't get close without plenty of warning to the US. Secondly, bordered on both sides by huge oceans the attackers would have to figure out a way to get an enormous number of troops, weapons, ammunition, food, and such into position without the world's largest air force, and the US Navy (the second largest air force btw) blowing them to bits. Should they do the impossible and establish a landing then they would be stuck trying to supply their troops against these same forces for the entire length of the war. (See Battle of Leningrad). In addition, the American people are armed to the teeth and have shown that they have the belly for a fight. Partisan groups would be impossible to quell and the constant harassment would make life extremely difficult. So the attackers would find himself cut off thousands of miles from home with no supply lines, no way to bring in reinforcements, and a hostile population that would fight to the death. There are probably other good reasons but this came to mind immediately. ",

However, this kind of sneak attack would only be remotely possible if the U.S. doesn't notice the necessary logistical build-up on the Russian side.  Amphibious landings are some of the trickiest and costliest military maneuvers. It's extremely unlikely that such a huge undertaking could be hidden in this age of satellite technology and cyber-espionage.  And at the very least, Sarah Palin of course would see the Russian invasion coming, as she famously can see Russia from her house.  Now, whether anyone in the U.S. would actually listen to Sarah Palin if she cried wolf on Russia is another story. Now -- does the Russian military have contingency plans to knock out U.S. offensive military capabilities as quickly as possible in the event of a sudden outbreak of war?  Absolutely.   Always has and always will. ",
