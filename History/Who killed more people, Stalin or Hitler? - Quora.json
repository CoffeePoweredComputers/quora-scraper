            "answer_text": "This somewhat depends on how you calculate. Hitler killed 11 million people in the Holocaust; Stalin killed 20\u201325 million people in his famines plus another million or so in his Great Terror. On paper, Stalin looks like the bloodier of the two. However, you might also want to consider that famines were nothing new in Russia or Eastern Europe, and while Stalins\u2019 Collectivisation certainly was in a very different scale from what had come before and in many cases was definitely designed to \u201cthin the herd\u201d, such as in the Ukraine with Holodomor, at least some of those people may have died in famines anyway had Stalin done nothing or never existed at all. On the flip side, Hitler provoked or started wars that ended up with around 70+million people dead, (this includes Holocaust numbers), and they were usually wars of brutal subjugation and extermination. Stalin was also brutal in warfare and certainly started conflicts of his own, but the bloodiest war in human history was the Nazi-Soviet War / Eastern Front in which the majority of casualties were Soviet citizens, and while Stalin killed plenty of his own people in this conflict too (zero tolerance for cowardice, failure or treason, real or imagined; his own tactical and strategic blunders), it was Hitler who started it and Hitler who escalated it to a Total War whose goal was nothing short of the utter annihilation of as many people he could get his hands on. If you hold Hitler responsible for World War II- and since he started it, for his ruthlessly genocidal selfish ends no less, that is a perfectly reasonable position- then Hitler definitely killed way more people than Stalin did. If you don\u2019t do that, but still want to add the numbers each man is responsible for killing in war, you might still find Hitler more bloody, depending on how you calculate the numbers. Another thing to consider- Stalin ruled for 30 years and 25+ million people; Hitler ruled for only 12 and was already approaching half that number. Stalin mostly killed indirectly with starvation and his killings were a secondary goal to his primary aim of a Soviet Industrial Revolution; Hitler killed through mass shootings and gas chambers, and extermination was part and parcel of his goal of ethnic cleansing to make room for German living space. Stalin may have been planning to kill more people had he lived, but the scale his next intended mass killing was unknown; Hitler was definitely planning to continue his genocides and while Stalin stopped because he had achieved his goal, Hitler only stopped because others prevented him from diminishing, if he ever intended to finish in the first place. So, even though Stalin arguably killed more people, it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying on the part of Hitler. If Hitler killed less- and again, this depends on how you calculate it- it\u2019s only because the rest of the world stopped him from killing more. ",

            "answer_text": "Hitler is worse than Stalin, because a lot of the deaths with Stalin were the result of neglect, or bad policies, not intentional acts. Stalin had a lot of people killed, but most of the people whose deaths are attributed to Stalin died of famine (caused by his policies) or disease. So, his killing, though horrific, was indirect. On the other hand, Hitler took an active role in the deaths of 10 million people. His middle managers held meetings to discuss the best way of exterminating the Jews and the Roma, going over the various techniques, and coming up with gassing as being the most efficient method. In the middle of a war, Hitler devoted resources and manpower to his project of extermination of the Jews. So, Stalin enacted policies that he knew would probably kill lots of people and did, but didn't care if they did or did not. Hitler enacted policies designed specifically to kill lots of people, which resulted in the Holocaust. In legal parlance, Hitler was guilty of willful genocide, whereas Stalin in most cases was guilty of depraved indifference to human life. Now, this isn't to defend Stalin. He was a horrible, awful, disgusting human being. And he did willfully kill lots of people in his purges. It's just that Hitler was worse. Honest to God, the more you learn about the Holocaust, the worse it gets. ",
