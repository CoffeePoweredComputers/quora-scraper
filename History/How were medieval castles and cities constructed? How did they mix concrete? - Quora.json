            "answer_text": "Concrete has been around much longer than the medieval castles. The Romans used concrete extensively and as a matter of fact had concrete technology that we still do not fully understand today. The fact that many of the structures are still standing and resist water better than anything we now have attests to that. So yes, they just used concrete much like we do today. ",
