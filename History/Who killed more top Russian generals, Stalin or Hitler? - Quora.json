            "answer_text": "Official records and personnel data maintained by the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense indicate that, from June 1941 through May 1945, 416 general officers in the Soviet Armed Forces perished during the conflict against Nazi German, which makes about 15% of a total 6000. Other sources put it at 180 (see below) How and why did the Americans kill Soviet general Kotov? Let's now try to compare these figures with the victims of Stalin's prewar purges \u0420\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0438 Historian Pavel Aptekar about one of the iconic cases of 1937    \" We are missing you so much today\" . Children of WW2. Polls: Stalin is currently the most popular leader with Peter the great and Pushkin being distant #2 and 3 On June 12, 1937, the Soviet central newspapers announced the death sentence to members of the military conspiracy. Famous warlords, heroes of the Civil War, Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, commanders Jerome Uborevich, Jonah Yakir, August Cork and other commanders were called spies and conspirators and shot. The Tukhachevsky affair marked the beginning of mass repressions in the Red Army in 1936\u20131938, during which tens of thousands of commanders were arrested, most were destroyed or spent many years in prison. The purge of the Red Army undertaken to fight the mythical \u201cfifth column\u201d turned into demoralization and a drop in combat readiness. There were purges of the Red Army command staff until 1937. The first chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council, Lev Trotsky, said that it was impossible to build an army without repressions. The number of former tsarist officers arrested during the OGPU \"Spring\" operation (1930\u20131931), most of whom served during the Civil War in the Red Army, was, according to various sources, from 5,000 to 10,000. They became victims of class suspicion and unfolded in the late 1920s Killing friends and sheepishly waiting for their own execution. In order to give the trial of the military leaders the appearance of objectivity, a special judicial presence of the Supreme Court was created, chaired by the head of its Military College Vasily Ulrich. It included Marshals Vasily Blucher and Semyon Budyonny, the commanders of Jacob Alksnis, Ivan Belov, Boris Shaposhnikov, Pavel Dybenko, Nikolai Kashirin and Commander Elisey Goryachev. During the trial, the military, with the exception of Shaposhnikov and partly Alksnis, sought to demonstrate their hostility to the accused and supported the prosecution. Without much effect: out of the eight members of the presence, only Budyonny and Shaposhnikov survived, four were shot, Blucher died of torture, Goryachev committed suicide. Former commanders, broken during the investigation, fully admitted their guilt. All were sentenced to death. Yakir tried to save his life in a penitential letter: \u201cNative, close comrade. Stalin. I dare to turn to you like that, for I have said everything, I have given everything, and it seems to me that I am again an honest, devoted to the party, state, people fighter, as I have been for many years ... I admitted my guilt, I completely repented. I believe infinitely in the correctness and expediency of the decision of the court and the government <...> I will die with words of love for you, the party and the country, with unlimited faith in the victory of communism. \" Stalin left a resolution on the letter: \"a scoundrel and a prostitute.\" \u201cA perfectly accurate definition,\u201d added Voroshilov and Molotov. \u201cBastard, scum and SoB...\u201d wrote Lazar Kaganovich. On the night of June 12, all the accused were shot. The case of a military conspiracy, beginning with the highest commanders, devoured the army with a cancerous tumor. Repression was not limited to the elite. The report of the Office of the command and command staff, prepared in November 1937, indicated that from January to October, * 14,665 commanders in the ranks from lieutenant to captain and the corresponding ones were dismissed from the army. * The total number of dismissed and repressed military varies in the writings of various authors from 11,000 to 50,000. * Historian Oleg Souvenir pointed out that in 1937-1938. about 500 senior commanders with the rank from brigade commander to marshal were arrested, 412 of them were executed, another 29 died under investigation. * For comparison: during the years of World War II, the Red Army lost 180 generals. From the Gulag to the Reichstag After the removal of Yezhov from the post of People's Commissar of Internal Affairs in November 1938, the repressions weakened sharply, thousands of commanders were released from the camps and from the investigation and returned to the Red Army, proving fidelity to their homeland on the battlefields of the Great Patriotic War. Among them were future Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, Colonel General Alexander Gorbatov and Vasily Yushkevich. Arrested and released before the war, the commander of the Moscow proletarian division Leonid Petrovsky and the commander of the tank brigade Alexander Lizyukov received general ranks and died in battles. On the eve of World War II, the Chekists organized another major purge of the military: General Pavel Rychagov, head of the Red Army Air Force Directorate, Colonel General Grigory Stern, head of the Air Defense Directorate, were arrested. Deputy People's Commissar of Defense Kirill Meretskov, former head of the Red Army intelligence department Ivan Proskurov. * Most of the defendants in this case were shot in the fall of 1941 and in the winter of 1942 with Wehrmacht at Moscow. Thousands of Red Army commanders continued to be wary of surveillance and arrests, and understood that military exploits would not protect them from arbitrariness if the abstract interests of the state or political necessity required it. Marshal of the Soviet Union A.M. Vasilevsky believed that the repressions of 1937 played a significant role in the history of the USSR: \"Without the thirty-seventh year, perhaps there would have been no war at all in the forty-first year. In the fact that Hitler decided to start the war in the forty-first year, an important role was played by the assessment of the degree of defeat of the military personnel that we had.\"  Russian pows, 1941 ",
