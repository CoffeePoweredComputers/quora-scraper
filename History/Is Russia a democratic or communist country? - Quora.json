            "answer_text": "All your questions are easily answered by the below factoid: Biggest opposition of Putin's United Russia (center right party) is Communist party.  No one is kicking down their doors, no one is jailing their politicians, no one is shutting down their newspapers and publications, no one is preventing their speakers from speaking.  Actually, Siberian province just got a communist governor in last elections. ............. There, see, a lot of stuff ranging from democratic to communist explained in one small factoid. As for why you have those misperceptions: Repression:  Jailing/busting of various 'opposition' personas with known (sometimes open) links to US backed color revolution organizations like national endowment of democracy is not 'antidemocratic'. In usa you cant even have  such a politician with strong ties to abroad, god forbid someone receiving funding from abroad in open or veiled ways. At least, from countries which US doesnt approve. \"Democratic country\": If i ask right now, you would tell me that Venezuela is not democratic.  This is despite the last elections in venezuela were the most monitored in human history, and were monitored by hundreds of international organizations to boot. Even Jimmy Carter foundation (that one) testified to the authenticity and validity of elections. But look at US media and they will tell you that Venezuela is a dictatorship and maduro is a dictator. Few US presidents boasted votes and approval rate as high as chavez or maduro in the recent decades, at their peak of their popularity. The moment Chavez nationalized venezuela's oil, was the moment american media declared him a dictator, and seeing how maduro did not privatize the oil again, the same narrative continues. \"Even more democracy\" 2000 and 2004 elections in USA are STILL being sued in various state courts for grand fraud. Diebold voting machines are another matter of lawsuits. US may be risking electing YET ANOTHER clinton, after having elected two bushes three times.  Princeton University research says US is no longer a democracy, but an oligarchy, and Jimmy Carter, an ex us president, confirms. Princeton Study: U.S. No Longer An Actual Democracy This should tell you how misrepresented and wrongly applied are the standards they are selling you from wherever you bought them... ",
