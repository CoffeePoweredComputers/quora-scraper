            "answer_text": "No, not at all. The term \u2019Rinascita\u2019 was first recorded by Giorgio Vasari already in the sixteenth century (Vite de' pi\u00f9 eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori italiani, da Cimabue insino \u00e0 tempi nostri) but the notion of Renaissance as we understand it today came from Jules Michelet in his 1855 work, Histoire de France (History of France). He was the first historian to use and define the word Renaissance. The publication of Jacob Burckhardt's book The Renaissance Culture in Italy (1867) spread the word and meaning all over the world. Note also that especially artistically the Renaissance started in Flanders and Germany well before Italy. ",
