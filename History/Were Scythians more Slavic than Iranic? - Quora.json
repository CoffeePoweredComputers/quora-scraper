            "answer_text": "The Scythians were Iranian in the original sense of the word, i.e., Iranic (not the modern nationality called Iranian). At one time, most Indo-European languages were spread out across Europe and Asia in a single dialect continuum. From West to East they were Celtic, Italic, Germanic, Baltic, Slavic, and Indo-Iranian. Several other branches of Indo-European do not fit into this model and may represent earlier waves of migration or expansion. Proto-Slavic and proto-Indo-Iranian were thus once neighbors, with proto-Indo-Iranians living in the Ukraine, and proto-Slavs living somewhere nearby, maybe Poland or Balarus. Indo-Iranians then spread out across Central Asia. Some of them later migrated into India to become the Indic-speaking peoples, while others migrated into the Iranian Plateau. The ones who remained in Central Asia and Ukraine became various sorts of nomadic and semi-nomadic horsemen, including the Scythians. Between 500 BC and 500 AD they gradually got pushed out of Central Asia by the Huns and Turks. Many Scythians ended up in the Slavic countries, where they were assimilated. ",

Slavs and Scythians didn\u2019t exist at the same time, this is a very big mistake spread everywhere. Slavs are just the continuation of Scythians. Most people who put false comments of current academia on this subject have even no idea how Old Iranian language sounds, thus they don\u2019t understand that in fact Slavs are speaking to a distorted form of Avestan or Old Iranian language.
