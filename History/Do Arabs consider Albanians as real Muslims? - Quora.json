Those who accuse muslims of being non-muslim are themselves at risk of leaving the folds of Islam In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (6104) and Saheeh Muslim(60) it is narrated from \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIf a man declares his brother to be a kaafir (disbeliever) , it will apply to one of them.\u201d According to another report: \u201cEither it is as he said, otherwise it will come back to him (he will be the disbeliever).\u201d Those who call Muslims \u201cnon-muslims\u201d (Takfir) are usually khawaarij (ISIS). One of the most well known sheikhs of modern times is an Albanian sheikh named Muhammad Nasir-ud-D\u012bn al-Albani and is known by almost all Arab and non Arab Muslims.  ",

            "answer_text": "Do Arabs consider Albanians as real Muslims? Short answer: Yes they do. Long answer: Arabs and all other Muslims for that matter consider a Muslim to be a Muslim if they proclaim them self to be one regardless of nationality. Most Arabs I know know little of Albania or its people. From my understanding it is more liberal than most Muslim majority countries but I have never seen any Arab or otherwise question whether the Muslims inhabiting Albania are real Muslims or not. Thanks for the question Ron. Cheers (: ",

They know that a large number of Turks don\u2019t practice, but they are considered Muslims nonetheless. A person would be considered not a Muslim if he/she self identifies as non-Muslim, or claims he/she is Muslim but claims that he believes in certain things that get him out of Islam, such as believing Mohammed is God, or that there is no heaven and hell. Up to our knowledge, Albanians as a group do not claim that they believe in such things, and they self identify as Muslims so as far as the rest of the Muslim world is concerned, they are Muslims. Whether or not they follow the religion diligently or not is irrelevant. ",

Since I have to limit myself to my own opinions and never speak for the multitude that is about hundreds of millions of Arabs I told you my own point of view. Arabs read less than expected, much much less, they follow trivia today ,not the useful knowledge, so they can be familiar to some extent with only countries that appear in the news quite often, Albania seems to be but one .
