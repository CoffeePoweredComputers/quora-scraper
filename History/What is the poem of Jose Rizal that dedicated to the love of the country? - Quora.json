            "answer_text": "The poem, \"Mi \u00faltimo adi\u00f3s\", translated in English as \u201cMy Last Farewell\u201d is the last poem written by Dr. Jos\u00e9 Rizal. He was a polymath, a reformist and a venerated national hero of the Philippines. The Mi \u00faltimo adi\u00f3s poem is one out of many literary works written by him, all of which, are testaments to his unwavering love for his country. Dr. Jos\u00e9 Rizal was executed by the Spanish colonial government on December 30th, 1896.  \"My Last Farewell\"translation by Encarnacion Alzona & Isidro Escare Abeto Farewell, my adored Land, region of the sun caressed,Pearl of the Orient Sea, our Eden lost,With gladness I give you my life, sad and repressed;And were it more brilliant, more fresh and at its best,I would still give it to you for your welfare at most. On the fields of battle, in the fury of fight,Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy,The place does not matter: cypress, laurel, lily white;Scaffold, open field, conflict or martyrdom's site,It is the same if asked by the home and country. I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to showAnd at last announce the day, after a gloomy night;If you need a hue to dye your matutinal glow,Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so,And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light. My dreams, when scarcely a lad adolescent,My dreams when already a youth, full of vigor to attain,Were to see you, Gem of the Sea of the Orient,Your dark eyes dry, smooth brow held to a high plane,Without frown, without wrinkles and of shame without stain. My life's fancy, my ardent, passionate desire,Hail! Cries out the soul to you, that will soon part from thee;Hail! How sweet 'tis to fall that fullness you may acquire;To die to give you life, 'neath your skies to expire,And in thy mystic land to sleep through eternity! If over my tomb some day, you would see blow,A simple humble flow'r amidst thick grasses,Bring it up to your lips and kiss my soul so,And under the cold tomb, I may feel on my brow,Warmth of your breath, a whiff of thy tenderness. Let the moon with soft, gentle light me descry,Let the dawn send forth its fleeting, brilliant light,In murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh,And should a bird descend on my cross and alight,Let the bird intone a song of peace o'er my site. Let the burning sun the raindrops vaporizeAnd with my clamor behind return pure to the sky;Let a friend shed tears over my early demise;And on quiet afternoons when one prays for me on high,Pray too, oh, my Motherland, that in God may rest I. Pray thee for all the hapless who have died,For all those who unequalled torments have undergone;For our poor mothers who in bitterness have cried;For orphans, widows and captives to tortures were shied,And pray too that you may see your own redemption. And when the dark night wraps the cemet'ryAnd only the dead to vigil there are left alone,Don't disturb their repose, disturb not the mystery:If thou hear the sounds of cithern or psaltery,It is I, dear Country, who, a song t'you intone. And when my grave by all is no more remembered,With neither cross nor stone to mark its place,Let it be plowed by man, with spade let it be scatteredAnd my ashes ere to nothingness are restored,Let them turn to dust to cover thy earthly space. Then it doesn't matter that you should forget me:Your atmosphere, your skies, your vales I'll sweep;Vibrant and clear note to your ears I shall be:Aroma, light, hues, murmur, song, moanings deep,Constantly repeating the essence of the faith I keep. My idolized Country, for whom I most gravely pine,Dear Philippines, to my last goodbye, oh, harkenThere I leave all: my parents, loves of mine,I'll go where there are no slaves, tyrants or hangmenWhere faith does not kill and where God alone does reign. Farewell, parents, brothers, beloved by me,Friends of my childhood, in the home distressed;Give thanks that now I rest from the wearisome day;Farewell, sweet stranger, my friend, who brightened my way;Farewell to all I love; to die is to rest.

This is the poem: To the Philippine Youth Unfold, oh timid flower! Lift up your radiant brow,This day, Youth of my native strand! Your abounding talents showResplendently and grand,Fair hope of my Motherland! Soar high, oh genius great,And with noble thoughts fill their mind;The honor's glorious seat,May their virgin mind fly and findMore rapidly than the wind. Descend with the pleasing lightOf the arts and sciences to the plain,Oh Youth, and break forthrightThe links of the heavy chainThat your poetic genius enchain. See that in the ardent zone,The Spaniard, where shadows stand,Doth offer a shining crown,With wise and merciful handTo the son of this Indian land. You, who heavenward riseOn wings of your rich fantasy,Seek in the Olympian skiesThe tenderest poesy,More sweet than divine honey; You of heavenly harmony,On a calm unperturbed night,Philomel's match in melody,That in varied symphonyDissipate man's sorrow's blight; You at th' impulse of your mindThe hard rock animateAnd your mind with great pow'r consignedTransformed into immortal stateThe pure mem'ry of genius great; And you, who with magic brushOn canvas plain captureThe varied charm of Phoebus,Loved by the divine Apelles,And the mantle of Nature; Run ! For genius' sacred flameAwaits the artist's crowningSpreading far and wide the fameThroughout the sphere proclaimingWith trumpet the mortal's nameOh, joyful, joyful day,The Almighty blessed beWho, with loving eagernessSends you luck and happiness.
