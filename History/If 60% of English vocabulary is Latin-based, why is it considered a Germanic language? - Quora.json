            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a bit of usual misunderstanding about the lexicon of English, the statistics is quite misleading. Liken English, and any other language, to a train : all languages have a locomotive (the grammar, structure, word-order, etc.) and, say, two hitched-up coaches behind the locomotive containing its wordstock. The difference between English and all the other Germanic languages is that English added on three or four more wagons behind its already existing coaches, containing a vast hoard of borrowed classical-language words that act as a reserve - an available stockpile of more seldom-used words that can be called upon to spiff up a style, further narrow down a concept, etc. Those extra coaches contain a host of more elaborate words such as ineluctable, epistemology, and so on. The availability of that reserve does not detract from the fact that English remains a fully Germanic language: to illustrate this, let\u2019s open the novel I\u2019m currently reading, TC Boyle\u2019s \u201cOutside Looking In\u201d, at random, and read: Quote She dropped her shoes to the floor, smoothed out the stockings and folded them over her forearm. He\u2019d slept with Kate in Mexico, she knew, and maybe Susannah too, though it didn\u2019t mean anything\u2026./\u2026 She went into his room that night on some silly errand - underwear, did he have clean underwear for school - only to find his bed empty. The sheets and blankets were mussed, but that didn\u2019t mean anything, since he never made his bed anyway. etc. Unquote Every single word and word ending (plural -s, past -ed, gerund -ing, etc.) is Germanic, apart from the common Germanic prehistoric borrowing \u2018school\u2019 (Danish skole, German Schule, Dutch school) and the -et suffix in blanket. You can do that with any novel by any author: it\u2019s not like 58% of what you read is of French or Latin origin at all. It is more like about 15% or so in most texts: all the extra words remain stored away in the availability coaches, and can be drawn upon whenever a more fanciful word is called for (e.g. commence instead of begin, etc.) or a shading of thought that may not exist as such in the original wordstock (e.g. intrigue or exasperate, two concepts that are not entirely straightforward to express in anglo-saxon nor, for that matter, in the other modern Germanic languages.) You can also tackle the issue from the other end: take a text in another Germanic language and see how it relates to English. Here is a sentence lifted at random from the latest Baldacci airport novel I read in Dutch: Ze sprong op, rende naakt de badkamer in, en tien wazige minuten later had ze zich aangekleed. It\u2019s all familiar words, although often spelt differently. Word for word: \u201cShe sprang up, ran naked the bath-chamber in, and ten woozy minutes later had she self on-clothed.\u201d (i.e., in better English: She jumped off the couch, ran into the bathroom, and within ten feverish minutes she had dressed.) There was a \u2018classical\u2019 phase of the building of modern English, initiated by the Norman conquest when another language, French, became widespread. Triggered by the presence of that other language, Latin and Greek and French then became available reserves of words, to be stored in the extra coaches. That never detracted from English\u2019s anglo-saxon quality & essence H. Chris Ransford's answer to How much Germanic vocabulary does each Germanic language have? but led to the biggest lexicon ever. ",

            "answer_text": "If you hijack a shipment of cognac and spend your afternoons drinking it while listening to recordings of Edith Piaf, does that make you French? Are you often happy or frequently feiicitous? English is Germanic - not considered to be, but is - because it originated with the transplantation to Britain of the same North Sea Germanic dialects that, continuing to evolve in their original environment, gave rise to Frisian, Low German, and Dutch on the Continent. The French and Latin-based vocabulary did not enter the language until much later, and then as the consequence of traumatic social upheavals and cultural revolutions. Additionally, just because a word is in the English dictionary, does not mean that most people would actually use or even know it. When did you last use the word fenestration? When we state that English is a Germanic language we are calling attention to the fact that it shares its origins, not only those of its core vocabulary, but also those of its sounds, phonological patterns, morphology, and syntax, with the North Sea Germanic languages mentioned above as well as, further back in history, with German, the Scandinavian languages, and the now extinct Gothic. English is also distantly related to French and Latin as far as historical development is concerned. English corn and French grain are cognates, both being separate longitudinal developments from a common Proto-Indo-European *gr-n-. English, however, also acquired the word grain from Norman French as a linguistic borrowing, some time around the year 1200, just as it acquired the word sushi from Japanese during the 1960s. Borrowings are the consequence of cultural contacts, not of common origin. English is only distantly related to French and Latin, but it contains numerous borrowings from both sources that make it superficially appear more closely related than it actually is. English tooth, two, ten, foot, and wolf are cognate with French dent, deux, dix, pied, and loup, Latin dens/dente-, duo, decem, pes/pede-, lupus, as well as with Dutch tand, twee, tien, voet, and wolf. Such basic words, not erudite borrowings such as depredation and consanguity are used to determine degrees of linguistic affiliation on the lexical level. Even there, the fact that English and Dutch t- systematically correspond to French and Latin d- is the fundamental index of linguistic relationship in the first three words for the languages under comparison. Thus, despite having a large inventory of words taken from various types of French and Latin, English is a Germanic language, like Dutch, not a Romance language. Like family relationships, linguistic relationships are determined by descent from the same ancestors, not by association or emulation. The fact that modern French has numerous borrowings from English such as le football, le parking, le smoking, and le dancing, does not make French a Germanic language. ",
