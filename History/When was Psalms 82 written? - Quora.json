            "answer_text": "When was Psalms 82 written? Twelve Psalms are attributed to Asaph and Psalm 82 is one of them. Chronicles first presents Asaph as one of three musicians who presented music before the Lord at the time that \u2018ark of the covenant\u2019 was brought to Jerusalem (1 Chronicles 15:16\u201322). After the Ark was returned, David appointed these three (Asaph, Heman and Ethan) to continue to be in charge of the music at the tabernacle, and then at the temple after Solomon had built it ( 1 Chronicles 6:31\u201347 ). Asaph was remembered as a \u2018seer\u2019 at the time of Hezekiah (2 Chronicles 29:30). Interestingly, some of the Psalms attributed to him include \u2018divine oracles\u2019 (Psalm 50, 75, 81, 82). The books of Ezra and Nehemiah note the existence of descendants of Asaph (or perhaps a guild of temple musicians) who are involved with the music in the second temple period (Ezra 2:41; 3:10; Nehemiah 11:22 \u2014 where an Asaphite names Uzzi is called the \u2018chief officer of the Levites\u2019 in Nehemiah 12:46).
