We\u2019re learning a few things from this pandemic: The governments of the world, in general, care more about the economy than they do about human lives.Nations are generally underprepared for major disasters such as this.The majority of us have very little faith in the institutions that have been put in place to help us, and so when genuine help is offered (eg. in the form of advising us to practice social distancing), we believe it\u2019s all a hoax, which leads to us essentially killing ourselves.These issues are not only there with regard to the coronavirus pandemic, but also with regard to climate change, war, world hunger, and many other disasters that threaten our way of life. The world is looking for a government that will care more about them than about making money. They want to be a part of a nation which is prepared to do what it takes to save its people. If such a government could produce and prove itself, the entire world will fall right into its hands. Believe it or not, this is exactly what the Bible predicts (not necessarily as a result of the coronavirus): The Coronavirus and Bible Prophecy ",

            "answer_text": "America having the most confirmed cases of Covid 19 and the fact that the vaccine wouldn\u2019t be ready until the end of 2021 leading to more people succumbing to the virus, the nation is facing the likelihood of recession. The economy would be virtually depleted and businesses, trades and services unable to bounce back causing massive unemployment. And it would take a decade or two before life finally gets into normal.
