            "answer_text": "Nobody knows. But theories abound. The French soldiers in WW 1were called the \u201cpoilu,\u201d or bearded or hairy ones, since many sported huge mustaches or carefully crafted beards. British soldiers in WW 1 were called \u201cTommy\u2019s,\u201d a term then equal to our \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d It was frequently used in routine British government forms as an example of how to fill in your real name. But \u201cdoughboy,\u201d as applied to American infantry, doesn\u2019t have an easily recallable ancestry. One theory is that in the American Revolutionary War (1776), American soldiers used clay to keep their uniforms\u2019 piping white. But when it got wet, it would make the soldiers look unreal, like boys made of dough from a bakery. Again, in the Mexican American War (1846), our infantry had to march through dry desert. This would kick up clouds of dust which was white. Another has it that American infantry training in 1917 in Texas, had to march in white dust and, again, resembled boys made of dough. I like that one. When I trained at Fort Irwin in the California desert, I saw just how white the infantry got from marching behind our tanks. The only thing that wasn\u2019t completely white was their eyes. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually nobody really knows,but several different reasons has been offered! Doughboy - Wikipedia \u201cDoughboy as applied to the infantry of the U.S. Army first appears in accounts of the Mexican\u2013American War of 1846\u20131848, without any precedent that can be documented. A number of theories have been put forward to explain this usage: Cavalrymen used the term to deride foot soldiers, because the brass buttons on their uniforms looked like the flour dumplings or dough cakes called \"doughboys\",or because of the flour or pipe clay which the soldiers used to polish their white belts.Observers noticed U.S. infantry forces were constantly covered with chalky dust from marching through the dry terrain of northern Mexico, giving the men the appearance of unbaked dough or the mud bricks of the area known as adobe, with \"adobe\" transformed into \"doughboy\".The soldiers' method of cooking field rations of the 1840s and 1850s into doughy flour-and-rice concoctions baked in the ashes of a camp fire. This does not explain why only infantryman received the appellation.\u201d\u201cOne joke explanation for the term's origin was that in World War I, the doughboys were \"kneaded\" in 1914 but didn't rise until 1917. \u201c ",
