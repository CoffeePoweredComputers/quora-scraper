            "answer_text": "I think the most important thing to understand is that just being \u201cfull of water\u201d makes little difference as to whether or not a specific area is desert or not. Many things cause a geographic area to be \u201cdesert\u201d where there once was green or at least an area friendlier to more types of life. Position near mountain ranges. Forest cover. Grasslands cover. Plate tectonics. Overall world climate. Once a particular piece of land has been transitioned from the \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d into desert, \u201cfull of water\u201d probably does nothing. Probably the most famous example is China's Badain Jaran Desert where dozens of lakes pockmark the low areas amid huge sand dunes and not much life. Regardless of the cause (the upthrust of a mountain range or the relocation of a plate into a dead zone, etc.,) it won\u2019t happen fast \u2026 unless we have or soon will hit the Earth\u2019s climate tipping point where the negative events cascade in upon one another and planetary thermal moderators run out of control or are broken. Then you\u2019ll see some deserts. ",

            "answer_text": "Earth is currently in an Ice Age, which means the climate is changing between cold periods with ice shields and warm periods without. The ice shields contain a lot of water which is thus not in the sea, so the sea level goes up and down more than 100m between cold and warm periods. Also the ocean currents and air currents are influenced by those changes. Looking at the recent past, we have a cold phase until 8000 BP and a warm phase since then. So 15,000 years ago there was a land bridge between Europe and Britain, because the sea level was 100m lower and the Sahara had regular rainfall, rivers and animals and people living there (The Cave of Swimmers). But even small changes in climate can change a lot: during Roman times north Africa provided the wheat for the whole Mediterranen Sea, today its a desert and any farming requires irrigation. And actually the climate changed only a little since then. Thats the reason why the manmade global warming is such an issue. Earth will not become inhabitable, but the inhabitable and unihabitabe areas will change and real estate is a bad idea. ",
