            "answer_text": "The Turks were the first in our neck of the woods to use the trident for symbol. Then, our rulers adopted it as the sign of the House of Rurik. The Rurikid dynasty started our ancestor state, Kievan Rus, in the 9th century. At the time, they were pagans. Christianization of Rus happened more than a century later. As newbies, the Rus were very open-minded to everything that\u2019s cool and fun. Turkic imprinting Before the Rurikids figured out heads and tails out of the Roman imperial splendor, the trendsetters in our part of Europe were the Khazarian Turks. Further north lived the Bulgar Turks who knew things, too. Together, these introduced us to Arabian silver and the wonders of colonial trade from around the Caspian sea and Transoxiania. Our first idea of imported luxury items came from them. Khazar glamor The earliest written document in our lands is a manuscript written in Hebrew. It most probably belonged to someone in the Khazar trader community in the city of Kiev. Back then, the position of Khazar culture was so established that when the Romans invented a new alphabet for a Bible translation to Old Slavonic, they reworked Hebraic letters for the hissing Slav consonants that Greek lacked. The Russian alphabet as you know it is a beautiful baby of Greek and Hebrew. There was so much glamor around Khazarian things among the Rus aristocracy that they even called their chieftains Kagans (\u201cking\u201d in Khazar). Along with it came the trident symbol. We don\u2019t know the exact meaning of it in Khazaria, apart from seeing it on what looks like their coins or probably customs tokens. Fall from grace An increasing pressure from Rus and from other Turks in the neighborhood led to a decline of Khazaria. Their things fell out of fashion. The Rurikids started instead adopting more and more from our Greek brothers in Constaninople. By the time the center of our civilization had moved north to the land of Muscovy, the original trident was already uncool. The Rurikids kept experimenting with its design. They eliminated its middle prong, and turned it upside down. But there was a group who liked the trident as it was: our Ukrainian brothers. They lost track of who of them was a Rurikid centuries ago, but decided in 1917 to revive the original thing as a symbol of their new Ukrainian statehood. Anti-Soviet abomination The formation of independent Ukrainian state after the fall of Imperial Russia was considered very stupid by everyone in Russia, from the pitch-black anti-Semites on the right to the Communists on the left. Under Soviet rule, the trident of Rurikids was treated by our propaganda just like the swastika and the Jewish Star of David: an ugly, despicable symbol of bourgeois nationalism. Naturally, the Ukrainians picked the trident once again when they gained independence in 1991 and went about building their nation-state. The trident is supposed to demonstrate their continuation of the aristocratic democracy from the time of Varangians\u2014allegedly forgotten by the despots of Muscovy.  Below, a Hasidic Zionist and Ukrainian nationalist drag the chariot of the Cold War in a Soviet cartoon from the 1970s. The Ukrainian wears the uniform hat of the nationalist militia from WW2. We insist that this militia collaborated with the Nazis, which is why the man\u2019s ethnic shirt is adorned with the swastika. The Cold War holds a thermonuclear bomb. The chariot is signed \u201cAnti-Sovietism\u201d. Behind her are studio mikes of the American propaganda broadcasters, spilling anti-Soviet filth. (The text in the bottom is in Ukrainian, which exceeds my language capabilities.)  UPD: Translation of the text, courtesy of Oleg Volkov In one harness No, they aren\u2019t united by burning love,but by black hatred, the character of anti-Soviets,that\u2019s why they carry in one harness,a squeaky carriage of cold war  Below, our modern propaganda rendition of the Ukrainian trident. It\u2019s worked in the signature mohawk hair and handlebar mustache of the Ukrainian Cossacks. Both of these are assumed to be period fashion, courtesy of the Khazars. The baggy pants and long belt are later Turkic imports. The chipped sabre indicates the sore state of impoverished Ukraine, the cucumber their simple taste in food and the silly grin a shallow nature of their nationalism.  ",

            "answer_text": "The Ukrainian trident officially became a symbol of Ukraine in 1917 and again in 1992 (Coat of arms of Ukraine - Wikipedia) but it has been historically tied to Ukraine for well over a thousand years and possible much earlier. It was clearly one of the symbols of the Kievan Rus (Ukraine\u2019s direct progenitor). The first highly visible use of the Ukrainian trident was in the coins of Kievan Rus\u2019s prince Volodymyr the Great. (The History Behind the Ukrainian Trident - Ukraine Living). The gold coin of Volodymr (Tryzub Cross) below shows an early use of the trident as a Ukrainian national symbol.  The current form of the Ukrainian trident did not just suddenly appear out of nowhere. Quoting from the next reference: \u201cUkraine trident was known as a symbol of power, a sign of tribal elders or tribal leaders long before Rurik in VI- VIII century.\u201d. (The origin and essence of national character - a trident | Famous people of Ukrainian origin). Before Volodymyr coined and nationalized the trident as a national symbol it was used his ancestors and by various contemporary Ukrainian tribes. As pointed out on Quora by Oleg Kravchenko, the trident symbol may have been used by the Khazars before Volodymyr used it. The Khazar Khaganate controlled Ukraine from 650\u2013969 AD, just Volodymdyr\u2019s reign. Khazars - Wikipedia.  I could not date the item shown in the image above but the items shown in images below, which look a bit like the Ukrainian trident, come from a Khazar collection that dates from the 5th-11th centuries. I could not find out anything details more about their history but would not be surprised if there some direct connection between them and prince Volodymyr\u2019s use of the trident as a national symbol.  \u0425\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 Going back further in time we find that the trident form that is very similar to those found in much older Scythian coins. The Scythians tribes controlled the steppe of Southern Ukraine in the 7th to 3rd centuries BC (Scythians). There are many examples of Scythian coins with tridents on them. (Scythian trident coins at DuckDuckGo) One example from the images in the above reference is shown below.  It might even be possible to trace the history of the Ukrainian trident and Ukrainian language itself even further back to prehistoric times. Ordinary none-stylized tridents have been used as symbols of power by many groups since the dawn of time. The following very highly speculative article states that the trident symbol was used in what is now Ukraine as a symbol of power 14 thousand years ago or even earlier. If you can not read Ukrainian well do what I sometimes do; use Google translate to read the English version. Quoting from the translated article below: \u201cThe Trident, which at that time was a sacred symbol in these lands, could serve as a proof that the Kushan state was created by people from the lands of Trypillia - Oriana. In Kushany it became a coat of arms - a symbol of power.\u201d \"\u0421\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0456 \u0454 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0448\u0438\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0432\u0443\", - \u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0439 \u0421\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0447 ",
