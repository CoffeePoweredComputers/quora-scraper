            "answer_text": "World War III seems to be the new hot topic. If you are defining a world war in the context of the last two it is hard to figure out just who would make up this war. It is pointing to the fact that North Korea has the bomb. When will the bomb go off is probably closer to what the questioner wants to know. A world war would bring into direct conflict China, Russia and the US. For all the tough talk from Putin he knows going toe to toe with the US would be suicide. Putin has done a very effective job of selling the idea of Russian power as long as he knew he could get away with it. But with the current administration he has been reduced to doing close fly over\u2019s by his bombers. A sign of his impotence. When China and the US started talking about how to deal with North Korea, Putin felt left out hence these fly over's. It gives an interesting insight into Putin. He is a bully by nature and coming up against the current president has him frustrated if not fearful. Fearful in the sense that his bullying tactics will no longer work. It is also giving some insight into the president. As far as power is concerned there are three men at the table. The president and the leaders of Russia and China. This is a scenario that the president has been involved in all his life. The sit down with bankers, Wall Street, the government and men from all over the world as he built a financial empire. It is a world of the alpha males. The president and Rex Tillerson are a very formidable pair. In a bit of irony, Xi Jinping, the head of China that met with the president, did an interview where he said China is watching the downfall of the West due to its immigration policy's. He laughed (strange for him) at the foolishness of the West saying China would never allow that to happen. Fast forward to the American fleet heading for North Korea and the Chinese in a state of panic are reinforcing their border with NK in fear of a mass exodus of Koreans if fighting should break out.

            "answer_text": "When? How about now. Is that soon enough for you? The truth is that the world has been in a slow motion war since 1945, with occasional open flare ups. The first was roughly between 1945 and 1990 and was called the Cold War. Instead of fighting directly, which would have resulted in a nuclear wonderland, nations tended to oppose each other indirectly, be it Vietnam/Southeast Asia, South America, Cuba, or Africa. Today, there are multiple wars being played out. One is going on now in the Middle East, which started with Russia\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan and US support of the Muslim \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d (the Mujahideen), or what we called \u201cRussia\u2019s Vietnam\u201d (the Mujahideen would later splinter off into the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and ISIS, and Boko Haram). Later, this devolved into a religious war of sorts; more of Western values/Capitalism/progressiveness versus Islam/tradition/status quo, as well as Hinduism and Buddhism vs Islam over its various disputes and intolerances. Into that mix also was thrown old Cold War alliances such as Pro-Western Israel vs Pro-Russian Syria and Iran. It\u2019s West vs East, Economic, religious, political and personal freedom opposed to extreme rigid religiousness/ political absoluteness with no or little concept of individualism or freedom either political or personal. It\u2019s also economic haves facing off against economic have-nots. So really, that war has already started. Some mark the latest phase as having started with 9/11, but there were events long before that. Many call the huge influx of \u201cmigrants\u201d into Europe an invasion designed to destroy European economic systems and usurp it laws and traditions by openly defying existing laws, demanding key changes to confirm with their religious beliefs, values, and traditions, protests, as well as violence and intimidation, not to mention tilting the body politic to their favor (the so-called \u201cpopulation replacement) simply by increasing their numbers. In the United States, we are witnessing its decline as a world power. America is more and deeper divided than at any time since the 1850\u2019s\u2014-the decade which preceded the Civil War. There are many factors contributing to this; the fault all depends on who you ask and their political/economic perspective; even gender, sexual identification, race and religion (or lack thereof) are made to play a part in it. The fact that America has essentially become a two tier economic and political system has to be factor (as well as the fact that America is now a de facto Oligarchy) with one set of rules for the majority and another set for an elite minority. America has become a jaded country. We have lost our sense of \u201cuniqueness\u201d or as some as said, \u201cwe lost our heroes\u201d (as an aside, I just wrote an article on this very subject. If you\u2019re interested, you can check it out at AnotherOpinionblog.com). Many have said that America is teetering on either a Civil War or revolution. Unfortunately, I have to agree. There is much dividing us. We seem to have lost our ability to think and act rationally. We aren\u2019t willing to listen to differing opinions. We rather shout someone down or attack them verbally or physically than risk having our opinions changed with new facts or a different perspective. Once a People lose their ability to communicate with each other, they often lose their connection with each other, and that\u2014sooner or later\u2014will lead to a separation. It\u2019s just largely a matter of luck as to whether that separation is freely given or accomplished by force of arms. As for the rest of the world, it\u2019s on a slow burn with flare ups still coming. ",

            "answer_text": "There are certain flash-points that may lead to World War 3 SOUTH CHINA & EAST CHINA SEA The Chinese government claim that these regions rightfully belong to them. Why? Because there about 10 billion barrels of oil and 260 TCF of gas beneath the seas. About $5 trillion worth of container trade pass through the South China Sea. Neighbors like Japan, Philippines, Brunei and Vietnam are close allies of the United States. Therefore, the potential for conflict in the Asia Pacific region of two nuclear armed nations makes this issue a potential flash-point for a World War 3.  KOREAN PENINSULA The only thing supporting the North Korean regime is China, and for good reasons. If North Korea ever falls under the influence of South Korea, an American ally with U.S. presence on its soil would be close to its border. Therefore, China will do everything in their power to keep American forces away from their borders. Unfortunately, North Korea is presided by an unstable antagonistic government like plays brinkmanship with the U.S & South Korea. Any small conflict in the Peninsula could quickly escalate into a global conflagration with the United States & possibly other NATO Members backing South Korea and China & possibly Russia backing North Korea.  INDIA -CHINA \u2013PAKISTAN GREAT GAME India and China are natural rivals. They\u2019re both large nations with over a billion people, and they\u2019re both trying to leverage their massive populations to build their economies and are competing for the same niche in the global economy; that of a nation with an endless supply of cheap labor. A rising India concerns both China and Pakistan, For this reason China is making a string of ports and military bases around India known as the String of Pearls which is network of Chinese military and port facilities from the China to Port Sudan via sea lines run through several major maritime choke points such as the Strait of Mandeb, the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz and the Lombok Strait; as well as other strategic maritime centers in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. China\u2019s alliance with Pakistan put pressures on India\u2019s military in the Kashmir region and along the Arunchal Pradesh/Tibet Border on the North East Frontier. The entire Chinese-Indian frontier runs through the highest elevation of the Himalayas. Therefore, no large army can cross it. Even if it does happen, maintaining long-term supply lines is almost impossible. Power projection by India is limited due to buffer states like Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, Uyghurstan, and Tibet buffering China\u2019s main population centers. Furthermore, China wants to gain strategic access to the Indian Ocean to reduce its dependency of shipping especially crude oil from passing through a long vulnerable corridor of the Straits of Malacca and South China Sea. This strategy will enable China also break out from any United States and Indian Navy containment strategy. China needs control and influence in the Indian Ocean to secure its investments in food, minerals and oil, as they come via The India Ocean and Arabian Sea from South East Asia, Africa & the Middle East. They is a possibility that these three nuclear armed nations plus the United States can come to blows in the future as China increasingly allies itself with Pakistan to gain influence in the Indian Ocean.   ISRAEL - IRAN - SYRIA - HEZBOLLAH CONFLICT Another Israel \u2013 Hezbollah war is inevitable. The defeat of ISIS and other Sunni rebels group by Russia, Assad forces, Iran and Hezbollah highlights the changing balance of power in the Levant region. The events of February 10th, 2017 highlighted the Levant\u2019s volatility. Israel\u2019s red lines in Syria\u2019s civil war involves returning fire against any groups that fire into Israel (Hezbollah, Iranian or Assad). Also, deny the establishment of permanent bases by Iran within Israeli Golan border. Furthermore, prevent the transfer of advanced weapons transport from Syria to Hezbollah. To enforce those red lines, the Israeli Air Defense Force carries out attacks on bases, plants and artillery positions. Iran\u2019s ultimate goal is to operate militarily across Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon \u2013 north of its rivals Israel and Saudi Arabia. Iran controls thousands of militias in Syria militias recruited from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. As for Russia, Putin has signed an agreement with Assad to extend the military\u2019s lease of its naval base in Tartus by a further 49 years. Russia\u2019s base in Tartus is near the Incirlik airbase in Turkey, home to the US Air force and other NATO forces. The base is located strategically enable Russia to deter NATO from the Mediterranean to the Levant. The next Israel \u2013 Hezbollah war will be a missile war. The weapons Hezbollah acquired in recent years shows that it is still sticking to the \u201crocket component \u201cof its guerrilla doctrine. Its missile arsenal has grown since the Second Lebanon War to about 150,000 rockets. The vast majority are Katyushas. During the next Israel-Hezbollah war, expect Hezbollah to target Tel Aviv and other Israel\u2019s population centers. During the 2006 war, it was unable to fire upon Tel Aviv. This time around, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem are within range of Syrian missiles and Hezbollah rockets. Israel\u2019s Iron Dome anti-missile shield would destroy missiles and rockets that are being fired on them by Hezbollah and Syria. To combat the Iron Dome, Hezbollah would overwhelm the defense system with a massive number of rockets bombardments at any given time. By doing so, overwhelms the Iron Dome system. Thus Israel ground troops and air force would deploy across the border to Lebanon and Syria to halt the bombardment. Therefore, expect high Israeli causalities. However, Israel F-16 with its advanced systems can effectively neutralize the rocket salvos to some extents. Here is the kicker If Iran\u2019s revolutionary guard gets involved in the conflict, United States Military under President Trump would get involved for Israel. Russia may join to support its ally Iran. THIS IS A BAD ONE. Secondly, Israel gets overwhelmed with the rockets and missile salvos from Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria respectively. Also, tens of thousands of militias from Pakistan and Iraq joining the fight against Israel. Worse, Assad decides to use Chemical weapons against Israel. WHOA, ALL BETS ARE OFF. ISRAEL WOULD LAUNCH NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON DAMASCUS & LEBANON. Expect Russian casualties due to its air & naval base close proximity to Damascus. Russia, enraged, launches a major invasion against Israel along with Iran after the dust cloud has settled.  ",

            "answer_text": "When confusion and misinformation get together in the dark, paranoia is born. Fears of war, violence, and oppression fester and grow in the minds of the populace pushing everything but a misguided assurance of certain doom into the shadows. Out of this cramped and huddled mindset we get the bastardized half-brother of critical thinking: conspiracy theories. Claiming that World War III is just over the horizon is as crazy as it gets, but the state of the world is showing some eerie similarities to the pre\u2013World War II global picture. And history is a creature of habit. 10An Unexpected Invasion  On February 27, 2014, Russian soldiers strapped on their marching boots and took over several airports in Crimea. As this is being written, roughly 6,000 Russian troops are moving across the Crimean peninsula and forcibly taking operational control of military bases, communications centers, and government buildings. This is an invasion that has been a long time in the making, and it\u2019s certainly not the first time Russia has made power plays in the Ukraine. Ever since 1783, Ukraine and Russia (for a time the Soviet Union) have played hot potato with Crimea, leaving a bubbling brew of split nationalism struggling to coexist on the little peninsula. But the arrival of Russian troops is just the most recent step in a tumultuous few weeks for Ukraine. The country has seen its Russia-sympathizing president, Viktor Yanukovych, become a fugitive, a Russian citizen become the Crimean city of Sevastopol\u2019s mayor, and an emergency meeting of Crimea\u2019s parliament elect Sergey Aksyonov as the new Prime Minister of Crimea\u2014at gunpoint. Aksyonov has declared that he will follow orders from the ousted Yanukovych, who is currently seeking refuge in Russia. The country\u2019s politics are in tatters. 9The Ukrainian Conflict Is Reaching A Boiling Point  Ukrainian nationalists are calling Putin\u2019s invasion an act of war; Russians in Ukraine are calling it an act of salvation. Riots are flaring up all across the country as the two dominant political forces come to a head. This video shows two men being beaten by a pro-Russian mob in Kharkiv, the USSR\u2019s Bolshevik-run capital leading up to World War II\u2014and that\u2019s where Putin\u2019s army looks headed next. You can get a pretty clear view of the political alliances of Ukraine with the above map, which shows the results of the 2010 election. Blue represents areas that supported Viktor Yanukovych, so you can consider those regions comparatively pro-Russian. The purple areas voted for an opposing candidate, Yulia Tymoshenko. The darker the color, the stronger the support. Kharkiv and Donetsk are firmly in the blue, and represent two major Ukrainian cities with a strong industrial infrastructure\u2014and both are historically Russian. This is a group of very assertive, very nationalistic people at arms over the one issue that holds paramount importance: heritage. And historically, gray areas are reserved for the losers; it\u2019s the inflexible, dyed-in-the-wool believers in a cause who triumph in a conflict. Russia sees this as good news, picturing much support from the country they\u2019re invading. As one Ukrainian bitterly put it, \u201cNo one asked us. We are like puppets for them. We have one Tsar and one god\u2014Putin.\u201d 8Russia\u2019s License For Aggression  Though the UN, NATO, and the US have all gone on high alert, the Crimean invasion isn\u2019t an act of aggression against the whole world. It\u2019s a move to make parts of Ukraine decisively Russian, both culturally and politically. Obama initially warned that there would be \u201ccosts\u201d to this invasion, but he won\u2019t back it up\u2014he can\u2019t, not without a game of nuclear Russian roulette, which nobody wants. The problem isn\u2019t that America and the UN will start tossing bombs into Russia; the problem is that Putin knows they won\u2019t. This is a man who once said that the fall of the Soviet Union was the \u201cgreatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century,\u201d a viewpoint which harkens to the days of Stalin\u2019s Great Purge and Khrushchev\u2019s missile diplomacy with Cuba. And Putin\u2019s already on round two. In 2008, when Putin was still Prime Minister, Russia and Georgia entered a five-day conflict that culminated in Russian bombs falling on the Georgian capital. Humanitarian groups around the world cried out, governments issued strict warnings for Russia to fall back, and nobody lifted an actual finger to stop it. At the end of it all, Russia calmly strolled back home and declared that Georgia had been \u201csufficiently punished.\u201d Each time this happens, Russia becomes more assured that the warnings of the rest of the world are just that\u2014words, empty and hollow. The situation in Ukraine may not be a match that\u2019s going to ignite the fires of World War III, but it\u2019s a nod to a superpower that they have a free license to do what they want. And if you give a mouse a cookie . . . 7The Senkaku Island Dispute  Russia\u2019s not the only country setting the stage for World War III. As is the case with most important things, World War II didn\u2019t suddenly flash into existence; it edged its way into the world consciousness one little bit at a time, like a slowly rusting bicycle, until war was officially declared. While it\u2019s easy to put the conflict into the simplest terms, a lot of factors combined to make up what we now view as one war. The years leading up to the war held a lot of indicators that, in hindsight, revealed aggressive countries testing the waters of what they could get away with. Japan, Italy, and Germany were all involved in minor conflicts that the League of Nations couldn\u2019t stop, such as Italy\u2019s invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 and Japan\u2019s chemical-infused invasion of China in 1937. These days, China is reversing the balance by threatening an invasion of its own. The territory in question is a group of rocks known as the Senkaku islands, which are located in the East China Sea. The problem, of course, is that both China and Japan feel that the islands belong to them, and whoever controls the islands also controls shipping lanes, fishing waters, and a potential oil field. 6A Third Sino-Japanese War In The Making  China hasn\u2019t been the nicest neighbor recently. In November 2013, China startled the world by announcing a newly configured air defense zone in the East China Sea\u2014a zone that they and they alone would control, to the point of shooting down aircraft that wandered into it. But, in addition to Japan, other regions originally had claim to that airspace, including Taiwan and South Korea. Whether or not China was planning an invasion at that point, the Senkaku islands fall inside their \u201cnewly acquired\u201d airspace, and now they\u2019re threatening to forcefully move Japan out of the area. Tensions have been building in the Pacific Rim for a while now, and if military action puts too much pressure on the skeleton of their current political disputes, bones could break. And unlike the first two Sino-Japanese wars, this conflict could involve other countries in the region. South Korea quietly expanded their own airspace in December 2013, pushing back into territory that China had already claimed. Combined with both China and Japan aggressively rearming themselves in recent years, this territorial dispute has the potential to explode. 5America Is Legally Bound To Protect South Pacific Countries  A war only becomes a World War when the US gets involved. Unlike their official policy of stern warnings and disapproving looks in response to Russia, the White House has publicly and unwaveringly declared that it will back Japan against any acts of aggression by China. With about 50 percent of its Naval force stationed in the Pacific, the US will also be in a position to help the Philippines if China continues pressing to the south. They\u2019re yet another country that has been affected by the airspace changes, and the US is legally bound to protect the Philippines based on the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. This treaty doesn\u2019t even require anything as outright as a full-scale land invasion. The Philippines owns disputed islands within China\u2019s new airspace in the South China Sea (much like Japan claims to own the Senkaku islands). If China makes a move on any of those, the US Navy has to retaliate on their behalf, or they\u2019ll break the conditions of the treaty. 4Unlikely Alliances  But beneath it all, what do China\u2019s problems and Russia\u2019s problems have to do with each other? Although they initially ended up on opposite sides of the conflict, Germany and the USSR went into World War II with a non-aggression pact, which lasted two years until Hitler ripped it up and sent Nazis onto Soviet ice. With perhaps some similarities to that historic pact, China and Ukraine signed a nuclear security pact in December 2013. The conditions: China won\u2019t use any nuclear weapons against Ukraine, and if Ukraine is ever attacked by a nuclear force\u2014or \u201cthreatened by such aggression\u201c\u2014China will provide Ukraine with security guarantees. Why would China want to create such a pact with a country 5,800 kilometers (3,600 mi) away? And more importantly, with which government is China going to honor the pact? The past two months have seen a see-saw of political parties in control of Ukraine, but it\u2019s likely that China\u2019s involvement will be dependent on Yanukovych\u2019s politics, which are decidedly pro-Russian. He\u2019s the one who signed the pact. China says its relationship with Russia is warmer than ever, with China\u2019s People Daily describing it as \u201cone of the most active power relationships [in the world].\u201d It\u2019s been speculated that Russia is hoping to draw a Western attack onto Ukraine, so that China\u2019s entry to back Ukraine will cement the alliance between China and Russia. That idea reeks of conspiracy theory. But with Russia\u2019s recent agreement to supply $270 billion in oil supplies to China, and with the majority of Russia\u2019s pipelines running through Ukraine, China would want to protect its own interests. Either way, the enemy of an enemy is always a friend, and US-Russian relations are on very shaky ground. Could it actually happen?

But is Iran any real threat? Depending on the spin, it\u2019s easy to think so. In January 2014, Iran dispatched a fleet of ships toward US national waters. The Senate has decided that unless military action is taken, Iran\u2019s nuclear development will continue unchecked. And on February 12, 2014, Iran\u2019s military chief answered that claim by declaring the country\u2019s willingness to go toe-to-toe with American forces, on land or at sea. It sounds like a crisis in the making, but it\u2019s not as bad as it seems. Those \u201cwarships\u201d were a rusty frigate and a supply boat, the White House in no way backs the Senate\u2019s bill, and while Iranian general Hassan Firouzabadi did threaten the US and the \u201cZionist regime\u201d (Israel), it\u2019s worth remembering that they\u2019ve done so plenty of times in the past. Another point of contention is Iran\u2019s military force. Including paramilitaries, Iran states that they have 13.6 million people who can pick up a weapon at a moment\u2019s notice. While that number is probably exaggerated, it doesn\u2019t matter much anyway\u2014World War III, if it happens, will be mostly an aerial war dependent more on long-range technologies than close-quarters combat. And that, surprisingly, is an example of why not to count Iran out of the picture. They have an air force of 30,000 men with several hundred aircraft, along with cruise missiles with a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 mi). That\u2019s plenty of range to hit US bases in the Gulf. But most importantly, continued attention on Iran, Syria, and other Middle Eastern countries is spreading the West\u2019s foreign resources a little too thin, especially now that Russia won\u2019t be any help in that region. 2North Korea Is A Wild Card  North Korea tends to get relegated to the back row in discussions on world powers. They\u2019re potentially dangerous, sure, but it\u2019s a short-range type of danger, similar to the way you can still skip away from a mugger with a knife. But turn your back for too long, and that mugger can sneak up and give you some scars. North Korea is still firing missiles in South Korea\u2019s direction for no good reason. The most recent launch was March 2, 2014; they fired more the week before that. With a range of about 500 kilometers (300 mi), the missiles won\u2019t reach far\u2014just to, say, Japan. Or China. Or South Korea, or Russia. And since they\u2019re nestled right in the center of three of the biggest threats to peace at this time, they could\u2014purposely or not\u2014stir up something bigger than themselves, like dropping a starved weasel into a den of sleeping bears. Most frightening of all, North Korea is building a nuclear arsenal. It\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll ever lead with a nuclear attack, but if there\u2019s enough chaos going on around them, it\u2019s not impossible that they\u2019ll try to slip one into the mix. 1A Global Recession  World War I and World War II were very different from each other, but they had one striking similarity. Prior to each war, economic recessions hit several of the countries involved. World War II famously brought most of the world\u2019s economies back from the Great Depression, and World War I helped the US recover from a two-year recession that had already slowed trade by 20 percent. Correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation, but it\u2019s worth noting which economies recovered earlier than others, which may have had a huge impact on the way things turned out. By 1933, Japan had taken moves to devalue its currency, which led to increased exports and a resulting growth in their economy. They pumped the extra money into weapons and munitions, which gave them a decided military advantage in the years leading up to the war. Germany, on the other hand, entirely crashed, which made the Nazi and Communist parties take similar steps and earn overwhelming support among the populace. We\u2019re seeing some similarities today. While analysts are predicting yet another economic meltdown for Western countries, countries like Iran and Russia are looking to band together to boost their economies. Among other effects, that could lead to a second unit on Iran\u2019s nuclear plant; Germany\u2019s massive internal spending in the 1930s pulled it out of the Depression faster than America or the rest of Europe. And the global recession hit Russia less than much of the rest of the world, due in part to its exports of a quarter of the natural gas used by the entire European continent And then there\u2019s China. The US government is close to $17 trillion in debt, and China owns seven percent of that, or about $1.19 trillion. China recently flew past Japan to become the world\u2019s second largest economy, and if it keeps growing at this rate, its GDP is going to match America\u2019s in about eight years. The risk is if China decides to dump the US debt. China would take a financial loss, but it could be a crippling blow to the US economy\u2014and much of the world, since the US dollar is held in reserve by most foreign governments. If China and the US do come to blows over the South China Sea, the US could eradicate the debt and pump the extra revenue into military spending\u2014the exact same monetary flow that happened in World War II, only this time the guns are bigger. But don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t happen. Probably. ",

            "answer_text": "The next world war will be the last war. It will also be a nuclear one. Wars are fought when one side sees something it can gain from said war, that is also worth the cost of deaths and economic loss (for a time). Since the advent of nuclear weapons and globalization, wars fought between 2 nuclear armed powers will never result in 1 side gaining something through the war, because both sides will be completely and utterly destroyed. Globalization also makes it much, much easier to impose sanctions and those sanctions do much, much more damage. You can\u2019t fight a war without an economy. So here are the scenarios: Nuclear state Vs. Nuclear state Outcome? Total, mutual destruction. This scenario has yet to happen Nuclear state Vs. Non-nuclear state Outcome? The non-nuclear state will be starved of all trade and will have a rapidly declining economy due to sanctions. The nuclear state can then jump in afterwards and clean up whats left. The nuclear state is often much bigger and can rally more allies to its cause, and thus put more sanctions on the non-nuclear state. This has happened several times throughout history after WW2, most notably Vietnam, Korea and Iraq. Non-nuclear state Vs. Non-nuclear state Outcome? A conventional war. If no side has the backing of a nuclear state, then this war will go on as wars have in our history. This is why this war scenario is the most common. Conclusion, there will be no next world war. The next \u201cworld war\u201d will be the first nuclear war, and the final chapter in our bloody history as a species. ",

I don\u2019believe Trump is willing to accept a Nth Korea with nuclear ICBM\u2019s The problem then is what China will do, many seem to have forgotten the US and China have already fought a bitter war, both literally and figuratively the Korean war has actually never ended the negotiations only progressed to a ceasefire. The next very grave situation is the Sth China sea and Taiwan, again involving the 2 great Pacific rim powers The USA and China (do you sense a pattern here..) China has been obsessed with pursuing aggressive territorial claims, The \u20187 Dash Line\u2019 which includes a vital international shipping trade route and includes many islands much closer to other countries such as The Philippines. The international community does not recognise the claim and the US doesn\u2019t like China telling them to stop sailing their Navy through what everyone else treats as international Waters . There could very easily be a accidental incident that escalates. Even more concerning is Taiwan. Many experts (I am not one on Asian affairs by the way) believe China is willing to invade to bring Taiwan back under the control of the mainland, and the US may get embroiled in the fighting. I believe the artificial island building as part of their Sth China Sea expansionism is a prelude to this objective , ie to be employed in air-sea denial of US forces to isolate Taiwan , initially via Naval blockade. There is also potential for NATO vs Russia if Putin decides to expand West into the Baltic States. ",

            "answer_text": "Two things wrong here: History is not bound to repeat itself and the time of full scale global conflict has already come and gone. When the world wars started things were different. There was the perception that land and economic might could be captured through conquest and that countries could actually \u201cwin\u201d a war and arrive at the end of the war in a more prominent position by some standard. That notion no longer rings true. Countries like people usually act in their own self interest. If a country can\u2019t see an upside to fighting a war they simply won\u2019t do it. Democracies don\u2019t fight each other in the modern world because the backlash from other democracies would be catastrophic to their economies and there\u2019s always a less expensive more viable diplomatic solution. They also need the will of their people on board to go to war and since no nations people are really looking to send their children to die that will only comes when someone else is making aggressive moves. The collective wisdom of a republic or democracy also makes it very difficult for one person to make the decision to go to war when there\u2019s simply too much evidence that it will cost more than you could possibly gain no matter what you\u2019re able to gain. It\u2019s a losing proposition. Totalitarian states can make this kind of blunder because sometimes the will of a single individual can control the path of the nation. Saddam Hussein mistakenly believed the west could not or would not intervene when he invaded Kuwait. It will likely be 50 years or more before his country recovers from that mistake. No country on earth can compete with NATO (or even compete with the USA) and hope to come away from a global full scale conflict financially secure. The USA controls all the sea lanes so if you go to war against the USA your economy will instantly be isolated from the world, you won\u2019t be importing or exporting anything, you won;t have access to energy outside your borders and you\u2019ll not be able to maintain a position of importance in the global economy. This is guaranteed ruination even without the threat of nuclear weapons or having your infrastructure bombed. Look at North Korea for what happens to a country that is isolated. Because there is no upside, no first world nation will ever again seek to fight a global conflict. ",

China wants the West out of the Pacific. China is using Korea as a proxy to threaten the US in the Pacific. China is enabling all threats to US supremacy. And believe me, Europe wants the US to remain supreme on the seas. Or it is game over for the Western commerce. There is no free trade or globalism without the US Navy allowing open sea lanes.Take your pick of any four of the above. \u2026..War. ",

            "answer_text": "It will be a total fuster cluck. Nobody has any idea how to fight a war with the technology we have now in today's context. The longer it takes to get into WWIII the more clueless we'll be. Think about the trenches in WWI. The trenches were a horrible idea, but they were the best idea the current leadership could come up with given 1) everything they knew about warfare and 2) the newly available technology. The only way to get past trench warfare was for a bunch of people to suffer through it and then rise through the ranks so that the new leadership could have better ideas. That's why WWII opened with blitzkrieg. A more recent example was the coalition invasion of Iraq to replace Saddam Hussein. The invasion itself went well, but the actual war was the occupation and insurgency that followed. It didn't go well (isn't going well) but the follow-on push into Afghanistan went a little better because of all the experience people got in Iraq. Looking into the future, and involving near-peers, there's an event horizon. A Rand study speculated about China taking Taiwan and the American forces in Japan trying to do something about it. The Americans used F-22s and easily shot down every Chinese aircraft that flew against them...right up until the F-22s ran out of missiles. Then China just sent more fighters (because they have, like, a lot of fighters) PAST the F-22s to shoot down the tankers. Without the fuel in the tankers, the F-22s all fell into the Pacific. And that's not even getting into technology like China's investment in anti-ship ballistic missiles, which are largely untested. It's also not touching on how China already proved they can and will blow up an orbiting satellite. It's also not even close to including China's ability to hack information systems. And those are just some of the topics that are known unknowns. There's a whole 'nother category of unknown unknowns, like maybe there are \"sleeper\" satellites hanging out next to operational satellites, ready to activate and blow them up on command. The world doesn't have practical experience with what effects can be achieved by attacking a nation and its military through the internet, or the effect of attacking satellites, or supporting the logistics of 5th generation fighters, or the economic impact of war between trading partners tightly coupled through modern systems, or the limit of what one person (or a small cell) can actually achieve using modern tech, or how Millenials will react to a giant war, or which alliances will remain and which will crumble, or how modern global mega-corporations will get involved, or which technology people will choose to dump R&D into once the war starts. Nah, man, nobody has any idea how to fight WWIII. The mostest solidest prediction is that there will be a lot of mistakes. ",

            "answer_text": "To label something a World War generally speaking it needs to be global or at least affect a significant amount of the World. World War 2 is definitely a World War, but World War 1 was mostly a European war. Compared to WW1, WW2 was definitely more global. Therefore assuming that humanity still exists at the end of this \u2018WW3\u2019 to call it something in history e-books to be a World War it needs to be global. Looking at the highest risk possible conflicts around the world, in no particular order. Middle East generally - This is unlikely to spark a World War, more likely to be a long term insurgency contained by the more \u201cstable\u201d players in the region Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Gulf States , possibly Jordan . At this stage none of Israel\u2019s neighbours in a position to directly fight Israel and even if they do this again unlikely to spark a World War. United States (with Gulf Allies) vs Iran -Iran has no allies. It will be a mess but not a global war. China vs Russia - This is no longer a realistic conflict based on the relationship between these two nations. China vs Vietnam - This is no longer a realistic conflict based on the relationship between these two nations. China vs Japan or Phillipines or both (with US) over Sankuku Islands or South China Seas - This is unlikely to spark a World War, more likely to be a limited war. China vs Taiwan - Unlikely to escalate into a World War if China invades Taiwan. India vs Pakistan - Two nuclear capable countries however conflict likely to be a limited war. No likelyhood of other nations joining in. NATO vs Russia - Russia is not stupid. They know they cannot defeat NATO and are not likely to risk conflict with NATO. More likely to be played out in the Ukraine. Turkey vs Greece - Both NATO nations if hostilities resume will be contained by other NATO partner countries and not escalate into a World War Turkey vs Kurds - Unlikely to spark a World War. Australia (with US and New Zealand) vs Indonesia - This is now an unlikely conflict as relations between Indonesia and Australia are quite good these days but something could happen should there be some sort of issues in West Papua or to do with the Illegal Migrants policies of the Australian Government. United States and Mexico - Possibility for some conflict based on the current American administration. Unlikely to escalate but some extraterriorial activities by United States could end up in some skirmishes of some sort. Very unlikely to escalate. Argentina vs United Kingdom - A resumption of conflict between these nations over the Falklands is 20 years or more away at least as the Argentines have practically no armed forces left. East and West African conflicts - Unlikely to spark a World War These are the ones I can think of at the moment , none of which would likely lead to a World War. That leaves just : North Korea vs South Korea (with US & Other Allies) - North Korea could use Nuclear weapons however unlikely to do so. Response would be overwhelming. This can be contained as long as China is not involved. North Korea vs China - This is a possible conflict if China and North Korea have a falling out. Use of Nuclear weapons by North Korea would result in an overwhelming response. This can be contained as long as the United States and South Korea are not involved. Given everything above, and possibly some potential conflicts I have forgotten none are likely to escalate into a third World War. Not saying we are safe, just saying that World War 3 is not on the horizon right now. ",

            "answer_text": "If a third world war is going to happen someday in the future, there are 3 possible causes. Two nations collide with each other. Both countries then call for help from their allies, including global superpowers, which then expands to a major global conflict. This scenario is similar to that of WW1.The USA triggers or aggravates a conflict in a certain location, in order to gain a profit. If the conflict ends with the USA\u2019s unexpectations, an anti-American country will be formed. The country can then attack the US, while making alliances with other superpowers.Russia invades Eastern Ukraine, a place where many Russia supporting citizens live. This is intolerable for Ukraine, which can cause a clash between NATO and Russia.In scenario 1, the places that can trigger WW3 are Korea (North vs South), the Middle East (Saudi Arabia vs Iran), and South Asia (India vs Pakistan). It is impossible to predict when a war will start, but one of these pairs might start a conflict within the next 30 years, especially India and Pakistan. In scenario 2, Afghanistan, Yemen, and especially Syria are the victims of US interventions. Many of these countries have a rising anti-American sentiment, and Syria in particular has an alliance with Russia. This makes the matter worse. Although the US has withdrawn from Syria, it is certain that an unstable anti-American force will trigger a conflict in the Middle East, causing another US intervention. This can then lead to a world war. This might happen within 30 years. So Syria may be the location. It is unlikely that one of these causes will trigger WW3. However, if three of these causes happen all at once, there\u2019s a likely chance of a world war.  (A post I found on r/polandball, greatly explains the US\u2019s overseas actions) ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWorld War 3\u201d will be a war between the emerging superpowers in Asia and the established order. Where Russia fits in remains to be seen, but it is extremely likely it will side with its Asian neighbours. To clarify, the future conflicts will be with China (sparked by its territorial disputes in the East China Sea), or India (who is rapidly developing its infrastructure and modernizing its military with top-of-the-line Russian equipment). China obviously has the edge over India right now with its homegrown J-31 and J-20 jets (the J-31 is pretty similar to the F-35), whereas India still has to rely on Russian equipment. They are, however, developing their own indigenous stealth fighter program. Now, to when this future conflict will happen. Since India shows no signs of cutting its population growth to the same degree as China did with its one child policy, it will have need of more land and resources. At the same time, its neighbours will become more populous and develop their infrastructure and military potential (Pakistan in particular - trying to develop nuclear power). This conflict will likely occur around 2040 or so - if conflict can be staved off that long it is possible that humanity will learn to stop wasting money on some of the unneeded military assets and redeploy its resources towards saving the planet, and therefore ourselves. A conflict will break out at some point, however, and will likely be accompanied by biological and chemical, if not nuclear warfare causing mass civilian casualties. If either of these superpowers (India will be one by then) go to war, the world will need to be prepared for millions of casualties and total devastation. The \u201ctotal war\u201d of WWII will come back, worse than ever with the use of all military technology available. By 2050 at the latest, one of them will start a war. If that war is between China and India, it will be a catastrophe for the over two billion in their countries, and those surrounding it. Hope for the best, because it will be brutal. ",

            "answer_text": "How long did imperialism last? Even then imperialism could be more overtly challenged but it took a world war which no one really knows what started it and no, it wasn\u2019t really the assasination but why the assassination took place which was not really about whomever Ferdinand was banging as many opposed it and he was also dead. It took that much to weaken imperialism but you have some luck. That luck is climate change, the US has to stop autumn from turning to spring or else, their economic superiority might shift and if it does the world will take advantage of that. Trump is one of the twelve caesars, they hated the US or Rome so much they came to power just to help it fall and in every big empire it eventually comes to that. Trump is setting up the means for destruction of the US and its allies \u2026 by helping them because they do not know where the empirical line is and he does or he\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s a win for you. I believe God sent them. You can even destroy an empire by aggressively pursuing peace. China will try and build its own empire to rival the US with vital organizational differences that make her perhaps a better leader in the world. Why did 60% of the world\u2019s GDP support China and hates the US? They would love to see America toppled, it\u2019s pieties trampled under foot. How fast do old customs of an old empire fall with it? Pretty quickly. Then who knows what happens \u2026 In a few years, wars could ravage the planet. All you must do is encourage Nero\u2019s to seek themselves \u2026 well you took it out of context! Nero will be society\u2019s champion. Cheers. Many say that Nazi Germany is Greece. Kk. Boy did it end rather suddenly. But we are Rome without Masada but that can\u2019t be a general principle can it? Did Nazi Germany fall because of in-fighting? Hardly a pelopennesian war but isn\u2019t Hitler Hannibal? The first and second Punic wars. Osama Bin Laden? Is he Publius Q. Varus? No Mark Anthony and Cleopatra? No Triumvirate? Bloomberg and \u2026 Zuckerberg? No Graachus? Or is that Bernie? The Author reserves the right to humourous answers. ",

            "answer_text": "It will start within the next 2\u20135 years but won\u2019t be declared world war 3 until years later. This is based on the idea that until 2 superpowers engage in military conflict openly against one another then world war 3 will not have officially begun. The most likely places that could trigger world war 3 would be. China vs USA + japan and S Korea via: Korean Peninsula, Taiwan or on little islands and shipping lanes in the South China Sea. Russia vs USA + Western Europe via: Syria, Iran,Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, Latvia. It is in my opinion very likely that the USA will provoke Russia and China until they have no choice but to act, when this happens American and western media will paint Russia or China as the bad guy and most westerners will believe it because they don\u2019t know how to think anymore. It will however be the USA and friends that start WW3. If any one of these potential flashpoints should get out of hand it is likely that all the others will begin to start fighting also including India and Pakistan. It seriously appears as if humans are itching for another taste of total war, it seems to be in humanities nature. I suppose we shall see if humanity truly has transcended or evolved beyond the seemed natural tendency to want to totally destroy each other. The state of Total War is part of what humans do, and unfortunately is how we evolve at 10x (mabie more) the rate we do in peace times. ",

            "answer_text": "Total K.I.A in WWI- 41 m+ Total K.I.A in WWII - 60 m+ K.I.A = killed in action Total casualties are much more than this. The world has seen bloody wars and the death toll (as documented) clearly shows that no Sovereign Nation in this world is going for a full-fledged conventional war. Before deciphering the myth of another world war we need to analyse some socio-economic institutions and little history :- Reasons for WWI - Fragmented sovereign Nations of Europe, Mercantilism, Colonial expansionism, Newly freed Slav Nations( the Balkans), Delinked economy of world and secret alliances between the nations( like the triple entate). There were a lot more other reasons but in-short these were the major driving forces.Reasons for WWII - The Great Depression of 1929, collapse of economy of Germany, War reparations on Germany, Growing unemployment and Nationalism in Europe, Imperialism in Japan and so on.So to avoid any future WW\u2019s it was very necessary to establish some international institutions so that any major conflict can be avoided. Like - United nations - An international body to discuss on socio-economic-military issues and in such a manner that their decisions are almost binding on its menber nation.IMF- To specifically deal with economic crisis like BoP situations and help the country revive from an economic apathy.EU- to integrate the Europe economically and create an common market for labor and goods & services.WTO - to link the world markets with each other.The basic motto here is - more the countries are integrated socially & economically lesser are the chances for them to go to a conventional war. So far these institutions have been successful in fulfilling their objectives. No matter what Trump has to say about these institutions. And lastly the greatest gift to humanity- E = Mc*2, ensured that this world will never see another world war. According to the MAD doctrine (Mutually Assured Destruction) if countries go for a Nuclear Attack, then the attack will be so catastrophic that it will be impossible to restore the world peace & stability. As the great man said \u201c I dont know how the third WW is going to be fought but i am very sure that the fourth WW will be fought with stones & sticks \u201c International Institutions and the deep state of each country will never let any Head of State or Govt. to take such actions. Be it Trump or be it Kim-Jong-un. Period. Today the world is so globalized and economies integrated that the event such as WW is highly unlikely. The answer to your question - \u2018NO\u2019 . ",

            "answer_text": "I think world war 3 has already started.Just like warming laps in car races,the beligrients are warming up for example in Syria. But for the time being this war looks like more economical than military.However was not 1929 great depression one of the causes of World War 2? So the ongoing economic war right now might result in a military clash as well. Many people think that United States and United Kingdom are allies.But I think there's an economic war between them and they both have allies in this war.For example few months ago world leaders gathered in China for Silk Road project. It encompasses 65 countries. If it is successful the power of United States will diminish in Asia and Middle East.The allies of China in this project are Britain and Turkey. Turkey is important because it's neighbour of Middle East.Also Qatar is an ally of United Kingdom big British influence over there. Thats why United States suddenly imposed sanctions to Qatar soon after meeting in Beijing about silk road. It was also a message to Turkey who is Qatar\u2019s ally in Middle East. USA have other plans for Turkey especially related with Kurds in Syria.The weapons YPG/SDF got from the States can be transferred to PKK to cause trouble in Turkey and also can be used in order to stop Turkish advancement in Syria. So,the only way for United States for survive is to stop this Silk Road project. To achieve this they have to promote chaos and unrest in the countries which are involved in this project.Syria and Afghanistan are examples of this. But britain has the money card because they work with rotschilds and Wall Street bankers who can give harm to United States financially and destabilise the States .worst case scenario will be secession of the states such as Texas and California from the union.

            "answer_text": "According to Pope Francis, it has already begun, and he identified it with the sharp rise in terror attacks. Pope decries 'piecemeal WWIII' According to some in the US Army, it will begin soon. World War Three is \u2018ALMOST GUARANTEED\u2019 as China and Russia boost military, top brass warns If you look into the subject, please notice that references to World War Three crop up most often in YouTube videos, and tabloid news organizations, and fundamentalist religious ministries. World War has been a constant of world history since the 1750s. Giving an appellation like \u201cWWI\u201d or \u201cThe Korean War\u201d or \u201cThe Crimean War\u201d hides the fact that great power wars have never ceased. Is there currently a worldwide conflict? Yes. What is the nature of this conflict? Well, it depends who you ask. It is inevitably a war of good vs. evil no matter who responds. It isn't as simple as Muslims vs. Jews and Christians, or Muslims vs. Hindus, or most recently Buddhists vs. Muslims, though that plays a part in recruiting soldiers on both sides. It isn't just Russia trying to regain the influence and territory which it had at it's zenith in 1945, but that is part of it. It isn't China expanding it's influence and territory in the South China Sea, but that is also part of it. So, also, is Chinese economic power making the rapid rise of a world beating military very likely. Finally, largely unaligned influences like North Korea, Iran, local separatist movements which threaten internal stability of long established nations, these all add up to general instability threatening the current world order which is based on United States military and economic dominance. So, the US is holding it's own for now in keeping the status quo in place, but the war isn't over. Wait until the world starts really running out of oil for the next phase. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many areas around the world that have military tension, and almost all of those have been called possible causes for another world war at some point, but the current most likely scenario starts with Russia. CONTEXT: Over the last ten years or so, Russia has been building up its military and getting much better training for it's soldiers. They are now rivaling the US in both sheer size and in training. The US still has a much larger military, but most of that is in other places around the globe so Russia has military superiority over most of Europe, especially in the East. The Balkan states, a group of small countries in a peninsula of Eastern Europe in the Mediterranean Sea, are the object of Russian interest and NATO hysteria. They remain unaligned with either NATO or Russia,so they are fair game for both parties. They hold tremendous strategic importance, giving the controller naval access to the Mediterranean Sea and land access to the rest of Europe and the Middle East. This is a perfect opportunity for Russia to gain more global influence, and NATO naturally opposes it. SCENARIO: If Russia were to invade the Balkans, there isn't much that the European Union and NATO could do immediately. They would probably provide a weak defensive effort and try to hold off Russian forces until American troops came in, which would take some time. By the time American troops arrived, the balance would likely already be under the control of Russia. This is a tricky situation; by this point, there would be a serious threat of nuclear missile launch if NATO and the US invaded, because if Russia lost control of those territories there would be tons of political and economic sanctions against them, removing Russia from the global power structure. This is the moment that could cause or prevent a third world war. If the Balkans were invaded by NATO troops and Russia fired its nuclear missiles, there would be world war. If the Balkans were given up and Russia kept them, NATO would lose its influence and Russia would be in the position to start and win a world war. The best way to prevent this scenario is to very carefully negotiate with Russia right now about the Balkans and slowly move more NATO and American troops there to create a buffer to protect the area. I hope this helped! -Max ",

            "answer_text": "I do not see a war with so many nations involved but I do see a war between two well armed nations. If China and Japan do not sit down and use some binding arbitration I see them shooting at each other over the islands in dispute. The USA will of course have to back up Japan which will put the USA up against China. That would be bad.  Things in the Middle East are only going to get worse. Thanks to oil, the Arab nations have populations that they can not support on the land they have. They have to spend billions every year on food imports. When the oil runs out, which it is doing (Twilight in the Desert.....it is a book about the Saudi Arabia oil fields) they will not have the money coming in for the food. Hope they are saving a lot of money and making wise investments. While you can give up a fight over religion or ideology and not suffer much, you can not give up on a war over food or water.  I see China wanting to bring Taiwan back under control. By 2020 China will be able to do it. The USA needs to keep out of that as it is an internal issue of China, a civil war.  There is conflict coming in the Arctic. Five nations lay claim to the continental shelves up there and it is almost impossible to go thru without encroaching on the territory of the five nations. I believe they will try to charge for passage which will \"upset\" a number of nations such as China shipping goods to Europe. (The shortest route right now is thru the Suez Canal, putting their ships at risk by pirates.)  A Chinese company signed a contract to build a new canal thru Nicaragua, one bigger than the Panama Canal. That will put a Chinese company in control of BOTH canals and will effectively cut the US NAVY in half if we go to war with China over anything.  We are also going to see water wars. Much of India gets its water from glacial run off. With the warmer climate the glaciers are getting smaller and if they disappear, India is going to be desperate for water. I see a potential conflict with China over that as India will want to divert more water towards itself. ",

Vietnam, would ever have used it is up fo debate. I think not. But since escalations happen very quickly there may be only at most a few days notice. So we must pay attention to the Doomsday clock, and the warning it provides. So we can say at best that there are times, such as now, when the US government is being fought over by neo-cons and neo-liberals. The psychology of the PNAC crowd is very unstable, due to their reference to religion. When you invoke a God and the Bible you are in very dangerous territory indeed. Luckily we do not have Stalin on the other side, but a very cool and deliberate technocrat who refuses to respond to the wild provocations coming out of a Washington. So l\u2019d say that since Obama pulled back over the Russian missile shield over Syria,, put up to deter Obama\u2019s free fly zone, things have been a bit more relaxed. The accession of Donald Trump with his desire for good relations with Russia is also a good sign. When NATO finally pulls back from Eastern Europe things should improve again. When it was likely that Clinton was going to get in, with her bellicose warmongering, l was very gloomy. So, apart from the minor nuclear powers, l\u2019d saynit\u2019s less likely now. Best l can do. ",

Chemical weapon is a poor people\u2019s weapon and it can be very effective for attacking; but every difficult to defend --- almost impossible. And they are very easy to produce in mass quantity. As a matter of fact, a peaceful and totally legal chemical suicide is proceeding in global scale and in long term: chemical pollution from agriculture, industry, daily chemical products, the environment protection activities that burn synthetic materials, spray poisons to kill pest weeds and insects, public health measures that spray fungicides and antiracial agents. The officially established environmental allowed concentration is illogical: when natural cannot deal with these pollutions, the pollution only will accumulating but diminishing. And the effect is spreading out echoing in the ecosystem also it can be concentrated back into the food chain too.

We can easily increase world energy consumption by 1000 fold by turning tropical deserts into cities groups by using geothermal energy to cool it and turn Arctic Circle into habitable region by using geothermal energy to warm the buildings and roads.

That way, we only need 200 years to ruin the earth geothermal conditions and therefore earth biosphere.

This itself urges the other nations to build up its nuclear arsenal. But then it is always the weaker nations that will suffer a lot. These big nations that flaunt their arms will only go for proxy war as they know how hard it is to build an economy. So world war might happen in the form of proxy wars. Like the on that is happening in Syria. I consider that to be a world war. All because there are more than 4 major countries fighting and acting against each other in the name of tackling terrorism. And they have actually destroyed Syria. Yes. Hear it loud guys. Syria is gone, there is no rebuilding it. If you see the pictures of the place now, you will understand. And this is what war will do to the powerless countries. Another instance where world war is possible is a situation where north korea takes action. And unlike many people think, north korea is not going to start the war. US is going to make north korea launch their missiles. North Korea always plays by the tic for tac rule. It has always been their way. So I think USA holds the key to the next world war. At the same time i don\u2019t think the big guns of this world will allow anything bad to happen. As they know how bad it will be for everyone else if a war breaks out in this modern era. So we can either accept that World war 3 a fantasy or is already happening in the form of the syrian situation. ",

In WW1 and WW2 a combination of aggressor powers and a few colonial powers that held most of the world\u2019s territories went to war and sucked in most nations. Today there are 200 countries and few are as crazy as Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, or Mussolini\u2019s flop to provoke a war they probably couldn\u2019t win. Meanwhile there are no British, French, Dutch or other empires that had so many nations under their thumb that by just involving their nations makes so many countries and peoples involved by default. Maybe this sounds crazy but I believe most countries and statesmen, even the crazy ones, don\u2019t actively want to start a world war. What would it accomplish, how would it benefit them. Meanwhile even conflicts that have the potential to be big wars wouldn\u2019t bring result in a world\u2019s war. Why would peaceful Europe and stagnant Russia go to war if China invaded Taiwan which provoked an American response? Why would people in Canada, Australia or the Caribbean go to war over Russia crossing the Finnish or Latvian border to provoke a war between NATO and Russia? Would South America, or even Europe intervene in Saudis Arabia and Iran went head to head to device the \u201cCold War\u201d in the Middle East? There Simply isn\u2019t the all out stakes and inter-connectedness today versus 1914 or 1939. Then there is also the fact that relative to those times a lot more nations, societies and peoples are less infected by nationalistic jingoism, racism and militarism that often helps lead to war. The increase of technology and instant media and knowledge has shown our generation how terrible and futile and stupid War is versus previous generations that had much less of an idea how destructive it is. just a few ideas, but yaa, there will be no WW3.

If you see the history of mankind they have always fought at every era albeit not at the magnitude of world war. The primitive ones fought for FOOD because that was their basic necessity .After centuries passed and we started growing and breeding food then we fought for LAND , and subsequently people fought for precious METALS , MONEY and lastly they fought for MARKET for their raw materials.SO as our history suggests mankind has fought for using available resources and hence dominating the world. If you analyze the greatest resource of this era is KNOWLEDGE AND TECNOLOGY. Countries like USA and RUSSIA have already started KNOWLEDGE MINING . Companies who are helpful in doing this are FACEBOOK , Google etc. So it is apparent and imminent that this world war will be fought at our backyard not at front lines , the precursor for this has already been set by superpowers of technology and knowledge such as USA ,RUSSIA ,CHINA , EUROPE and even INDIA. We will never get to know when it will start but I am sure at the end of this world war we will be sent to primitive era of humankind. God bless us all. ",

So far, both World Wars were started with one reason in common, revanchism. The French were humiliated in the Franco-Prussian war and wanted to reclaim lost territory, the Germans wanted to reclaim what they had lost in WWI, it didn\u2019t go well. Austria declared war on Serbia in revenge for their assassinated (by Serbia) Archduke, Franz Ferdinand. Germany had a pretty goddamn racist tyrannic and most likely insane ruler. Both times the attacking side lost, except no body actually won either. In a post I wrote about a week ago, I described why I think that war is becoming a thing of the past. And right now, there are no real places in which a world war could begin. No points of diplomatic/international crisis. Just a North Korean narcissist making threats against the U.S despite the fact that China would most likely not come to their aid and they couldn\u2019t even dream of seeing the West Coast due the immeasurable U.S Navy. World wars don\u2019t just \u201cstart\u201d. ",

It has been conducting the test for Nukes and also have utter disregard for the United Nations Sanctions.Pakistan and India face off : since a year now there has been many attempts at pushing the two nuclear countries at the brink of war and if war breaks out Pakistan has been very vocal that they won't even hesitate to use nukes. In the unlikely scenario that US chose to stop Pakistan to use nukes North Korea might jump in as Pakistan and North Korea share very good bonds.Russia US standoff it is no secret that us and Russia are not best of allies and have in history shared very turbulent relation many a time coming close to war.South China Sea disputes : this dispute has been very prominent in recent times with ICJ decisions and extremely vocal asserting it's claim over the region. This making the countries having sour relations with China .Inspite of such issues the countries have shown great restraints in dealing with the matter and also a sense of maturity has evolved with exception of few .

Atleast not until a credible technique of nullifying nuclear weapons is developed. 2 powerful countries with nuclear weapons will not fight each other. If it didn't happen during the cold war, it won't happen now. The only possibility is 2 small countries(let's say north and south Korea) go to war, and each draw nuclear powers in on their side. If America joins with ROK, then China or Russia joins with the DPRK and attack America at home or in the Atlantic, NATO will be involved, India and Israel will possibly fight against China and Pakistan, then you have every nuclear capable country in a war. I think the world sees how quickly this can escalate and aren't that stupid. Until nuclear missiles are nullified to upwards of the 99th percentile by defensive weaponry, no country will touch them. That means that every NATO member, The United States, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, China, North Korea, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and the Philippines, as well as dozens of minor countries who have defensive pacts with these countries, will not be able to wage war without possible nuclear escalation. Show me a world war without any of these countries. Like America or not, under Pax Americana we have lived in one of the most peaceful times in human history. ",

Most of us don\u2019t realize that it is actually a world war because the war against terror is an unconventional war, but as the Jihadist are trying to amass power and wealth the war may take a conventional approach.  Above are boko haram Jihadist in Nigeria, they have pledged allegiance to Isis. The war will become more conventional as terrorist group starts to merge. If they are disunited then no cause for further alarm. Another recent development is the creation of a nation with boundaries by the terror group the name of this state is ISIL Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant although this state is not recognized but it is noteworthy to know that an area is occupied by these Jihad militants. Remember world war 3 is already here, it is every where it is global and Wicked. ",

Even if they could I doubt they would wage war against a major power such as the US given the casualties. It would be a massacre. China is defensive only and would never wage a full blown war. They have the ideology of never strike first. Only strike in self defense. Very admirable. United States has a joint military command system in place that can veto war orders if said order is considered unethical or a threat to country security. You are safe. Stop worrying so much. ",

Donald Trump is the wildcard, he may think starting a war with N Korea would be short with a happy outcome. The problem is, after the first shot is fired, war plans and expectations are often the first victim. Trump should be thinking how China would respond. what if they attack and sink major US warships to prevent follow up attacks? What will Trump do then? Will he respond by directly attacking China? How would China respond? Will Russia get nervous? How would they respond to nuclear attacks near their homeland? There is so much risk involved in starting a war no reasonable man would contemplate such a thing. Ask yourself, are you comfortable with Trump in Power? Can he be trusted to be reasonable? ",

Having gotten past that, even though it came close a time or two, there is nothing like that today, thankfully. The actual use of a nuke may be more likely, by some rogue state or terrorist group, but hopefully that would not lead to escalation, but maybe retaliation and end.

            "answer_text": "No, what happened in the previous World Wars were strong states who felt they could have a nice little war of conquest to solve an internal problem or two, or create a bigger empire. The aggressor states felt going to war was going to be short, sweet, and have a big reward. Maybe some diplomatic dancing around for a few years, but basically, they could steal from a weaker neighbor and get away with it. They weren't counting on fighting a huge world war against other strong countries. The world war part came about because they backed the other big powers into a corner and it became a Texas Death Match(to use a pro wrestling metaphor). Now we have several relatively strong countries: the US, Britain, France, Russia(whose military budget is not much more than Britain), China. US, Britain, France, plus allied first world nations: Australia, Canada,Japan, Germany,Netherlands,Belgium. And some smaller European/Asian Allies: Poland,Ukraine,Croatia,Turkey, Israel,Italy,Sweden\u2026some others All these countries have very strong economies (lots of cash: wars run on money), Democratic(mostly) governments, and benefit from world trade in all sorts of goods. They are all part of a vibrant world culture and economy. And none of them wants or needs to invade their neighbors to steal big bits of territory. (Some problem borders: Israel, Turkey for example) Still, lots of money, public involvement, and firepower. Very hard to see anyone starting a war to get something from any of them either. The scariest actors as far as potential aggressors are Russia, China, and Iran. All have been nibbling at their neighbors(much smaller neighbors), but basically, they are dealing with internal problems by creating external enemies. Russia has launched several small wars in the Putin era, but only if the opponent was isolated/unsupported. The Ukraine civil war was a bit more than Russia could get away with and it has turned into a festering sore\u2026the other Europeans got a cold whiff of Naziism from Putin and have drawn a line\u2026no more in this direction. Putin has been trying to make nice with SOMEBODY, but he keeps shooting himself in the foot. Eventually economic pressure will force Russia to declare victory and go home. Ditto Syria. China has, like Russia, bad memories of foreign invaders, and so is trying to push out to protect itself\u2026even though no one is really threatening it. (The US preemptive war in Iraq caused a lot of these countries to say: \u201cI know they SAY they won't use force to get their way, but look how much military they have--a lot--and if they wanted to hit us\u2026.well, let's create a bigger buffer zone, just to be safe.\u201d) Iranians also: partly military dreamers thinking of the ancient Persian Empire(Make Iran Great Again), matched with some religious zealots, and also\u2014both of these\u2014listening to the practical politicians who are seeing a young, restless, talented group of citizens who want to join the rest of the world. A revolution waiting to happen. So foreign enemies and proxy wars are just the ticket--trying to hang on to power without really giving the restless young anything(to do so is dangerous to the powers that be in Iran). All of these can create misery and death around the world, but in penny packets: using poor people who have no future ahead of them as the \u201cmartyrs\u201d. But absent a real shift in economic outlook around the 3rd world, those poor foot soldiers will be available for the forseeable future. So peace isn't on the menu, but neither is World War 3\u2026just death around the fringes. ",

The relations of the current countries are far close to war, and both countries are trying to advance in military power, Another example is within the current Islamic radical group, ISIS.

It\u2019s one thing when third world countries fall into this condition, it's another when first and second world nations are under this stress. Those countries will lower food exports or try to control countries that have a favorable climate in order to survive. Soon enough then these countries become the battleground it's fought in. Not World War III in the traditional sense, but certainly impacting the current world order in a big way. Any country without nuclear weapons will be a chess piece on the board. ",

In the sense that it will fall apart and there will be a vicious and quite hideously unpleasant civil war which will probably drag in a lot of other countries as well. There will almost certainly be nuclear exchanges but it will probably be over in a couple of years. My reasoning for this is that everyone is expecting it to be Pakistan-India or Israel or Russia-Ukraine. There has been quite a lot of serious people devoting serious thought and resources to preventing those areas from kicking off. Which is why it won't happen there. It will be a blindside from somewhere no-one is expecting. My guess is probably an outbreak of domestic terrorism linked to a fringe political party that causes a secessionist movement to start breaking the US into 2, 3 or even 4 seperate countries The sad part is that I thinks it's already starting to happen.

China might start a war (why would they?), but again nobody will follow them if they are the aggressor. And the USA will start wars.

Hence WW1 is WW4 & WW2 is WW5 so you are perhaps looking towards World War Sixth. ",
