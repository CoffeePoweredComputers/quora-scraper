            "answer_text": "The question here is what do you mean by \u201cat the end\u201d. When is the end of the Roman Empire? In the other answers you see many different viewpoints. There\u2019s the conventional popular idea that the Roman Empire ended in the 5th century when the last emperor was deposed by Odoacer. There\u2019s the idea that that didn\u2019t mean the end, and the institutions simply faded away. There\u2019s the idea that the Roman Empire actually continued until 1453 when the Ottomans took Constantinople. There\u2019s the idea that the Ottoman Empire was the continuation of the Roman Empire and therefore it only fell in 1922. All those are correct in a certain way (even if the last one is stretching it a bit, since the Kayser-i-R\u00fbm title hasn\u2019t really been used in a long time). But there\u2019s a lot more! You can say the Empire ended with Octavian winning the civil war, since the Republic, which was the defining ideology of Rome, was dead. But the Empire lived on, of course.You can say the Empire ended with Diocletian, who did away with the last vestiges of the republican pretense (end of the principate). But again, the Empire lived on, restrengthened by Diocletians reforms.You can say the Empire ended when Odoacer kicked Romulus out. But the Empire survived in the East, and Odoacer even acknowledged the Emperor as his overlord.You can say the Empire ended when they couldn\u2019t effectively regain control of the Western portions of it, but in Constantinople the Empire survived. Even more, some Frankish guy got himself crowned Emperor, and now we had TWO Roman Empires. One of them was even Holy!You can say the Empire ended when the fourth crusade took Constantinople. But even then the Empire survived in exile in Nicaea. What\u2019s more, the crusader state itself was a form of the Roman Empire. So now there\u2019s three (the HRE is still alive and kicking). And besides, the Nicaeans came back.You can say the Empire ended when the Ottomans took Constantinople. But Mehmet himself would disagree, and say that he was now the Kayser-i-R\u00fbm, the Caesar of Rome, and that the Empire survived under him. Also, the HRE is still there. And also, the Russians were claiming to be the Third Rome. So now you have a Roman Empire in Germany, a Roman Empire in Turkey, and a Roman Empire in Russia. Not in Rome, though, why would a Roman Empire control Rome? That makes no sense.You can say that the Empire ended when Napoleon disolved the HRE, or when the Ottoman Empire fell after WWI, or when the Russian Empire fell during the Russian Revolution. But other than the HRE, those have clear successor states. So you can say that the Roman Empire still exists as Turkey. Or as Russia. Or maybe as the Vatican City. Or maybe as Germany. Or maybe as somebody else said, as the European Union.Yes, I know, most of these is just stretching it for fun. But the point is that \u201cat the end\u201d, for the Roman Empire, is not a very definitive point in time. It\u2019s not like, for example, the USSR, where we can find a date when it ceased to exist, and we can say \u201con this date, the USSR existed, and the next day it didn\u2019t\u201d. It doesn\u2019t really work like that for the Roman Empire. ",

            "answer_text": "I faded away. Slowly its institutions and culture died out or were assimilated by surrounding cultures.  The Roman Empire of antiquity was strictly speaking not conquered in its entirety by a foreign power. Pieces were taken, revolutions undermined the power of institutions until not much was left to be called an Empire. But so much of its identity lived on in other places that its hard to define an end to it. An amusing anecdote given by somebody on Quora helps to illustrate that: When Greek soldiers came to an island in 1913 ceded to Greece by the Ottoman Empire, the children came looking at the \"Greeks\". The soldiers asked: \"If we are Greeks. What are you?\" . The children answered: We are Romans (Romaoi). ",
