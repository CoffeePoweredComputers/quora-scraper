            "answer_text": "His accomplishments are without equal. When we look at emperors there are certain ways to view them for ranking purposes. Mike Duncan, creator of this history of Rome podcast, spells it out like so (and I agree) If I asked you who the greatest NFL Quarterback of all time was, you may say Tom Brady or Peyton Manning. Now if you say Peyton Manning, you are likely referring to what I call \u201cpeak value\u201d. Peyton threw for a record 5,477 yards and 55 TDs in 2013- the best season ever for an NFL quarterback. At his prime, he was the best in the world (without a doubt). If you say Tom Brady, you are likely referring to what I call \u201ccareer value\u201d. Tom Brady has never thrown for 5,477 yards but he has won more games than any other quarterback in history. He holds the record for Superbowl wins, Superbowl appearances, and Superbowl MVPs. He has more rings and wins than any other player by a long shot. Augustus is the \u201ccareer value\u201d emperor- the Tom Brady of Roman politics. He never reached the insane heights of accomplishment that Aurelian or Trajan did. However, his overall contribution to the empire is without equal.  Now it may not seem like this because Augustus was not a \u201csexy\u201d emperor. He didn\u2019t conquer far off empires, he didn\u2019t fight huge battles for his entire reign, and he never faced down with some legendary barbarian. So compared to Trajan his tenure seems uneventful. Augustus was not a military emperor. He had his best friend, Marcus Agrippa, to handle that stuff.  Agrippa was more than capable of besting anyone on the battlefield and more importantly, Agrippa was a DIE HARD loyalist who would never betray his life-long best friend (practically brother). Augustus was great for a number of reasons that did not involve conquest. He started the Pax Romana (Roman Peace). He ceased war and conquest (for the most part) and focused on securing what Rome had already won. He brought a degree of peace to Europe not seen in centuries;He invested heavily in infrastructure all over his empire. It was said Augustus found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble;Augustus stabilized the struggling Roman economy and then allowed it to prosper like never before;Augustus secured the grain supply with his conquest of Egypt, ensuring famines were a thing of the past;Augustus stabilized the political system. Rome had been in turmoil for decades and Augustus finally brought peace and order to the city;Augustus ruled very well. The people LOVED him and he was very careful in using his power. He was a \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d ruler, and thus never became a tyrant like many others before him;Augustus added 50,000 people to the Cura Annonae, which was a primitive welfare system where poor citizens received free grain;Augustus stabilized the provinces of Illyria and Spain. These were both Roman territories but had been so in name only for quite some time. He marched with the legions to pacify these rebellious peoples thereby adding them to the empire as stable provinces (and tax payers). Agrippa did most of the heavy lifting here but it was Augustus\u2019 idea;Instead of pursuing war with Parthia (as was Rome\u2019s wont to do), he sought peace with them and established strong diplomatic ties leading to decades of peace between the empires.I am skipping a ton here, this is just basic 101 stuff. Augustus ruled for 40 years- by far the longest of any emperor. The really good emperors that everyone likes usually ruled for around 20 years, while most ruled for 7 years on average. His 40 year reign is packed with complexity and detail.  The big thing to focus on is stability. Put yourself in the shoes of an average Roman. Say you were born in 90 BC. You would have witnessed: Two civil wars between Sulla and Marius;Two political purges in which tens of thousands of citizens where slaughtered due solely to their political preferencesOne massive conspiracy called the \u201cCatiline Conspiracy\u201d that nearly saw the government overthrown;Armed groups of gladiators attacking protests and citizens during what had been sacred election days;The civil war between Caesar and Pompey;The mob taking over the streets for a time and grinding the entire city of Rome to a standstill;The civil war between the 2nd Triumvirate and the Liberators;The small civil war between Augustus and Antony\u2019s brother;Another civil war between Augustus and Sextus Pompey;A destructive years-long famine;A large civil war between Augustus and Antony.At this point, you'd be in your 60s or 70s. If you went through ALL of that would you be super keen on \u201cRepublicanism\u201d or \u201ccitizen rights\u201d? Would you be happy with Rome? NO- of course not, how could you be? Citizens were desperate for order. The entire lives of the Roman People living through the period when Augustus took over had been defined by hardship. Famine, civil wars, conspiracies, political violence- these were commonplace for decades. Augustus ended all of that. There were no more civil wars, no more famines, no more conspiracies. People were happy- the economy was strong- everyone was safe (as safe as they could be). Augustus brought order, stability, and prosperity to an empire that had been in a state of chaos for over 50 years. The citizens traded their power to Augustus for order and they made that trade happily. Despite turning a Republic into an empire nobody said a word. The only time citizens revolted was to ask that Augustus disband the Senate and become dictator for life. That\u2019s right, the only gripe the Romans had with Augustus was that he did not take more power. ",

            "answer_text": "I like to give great emperors little monikers that encompass their reigns and what they did. From the emperors you listed, Trajan is \u201cthe Conquerer\u201d and Diocletian is \u201cthe Reformer.\u201d  A bust of Diocletian Some more: Hadrian is \u201cthe Consolidator,\u201d Aurelian is \u201cthe Restorer,\u201d and Marcus Aurelius is \u201cthe Philosopher-King.\u201d With this in mind, what else could we call Augustus but \u201cThe Creator.\u201d  Augustus of Prima Porta Yeah, that\u2019s right. Other emperors, like Trajan, aspired to imperial greatness. Some, like Diocletian, even changed the nature, character, and definition of the imperial office. However, none of them would have sniffed at such power or opportunity had it not been for Augustus. He quite literally created imperial power and became the definition of imperial greatness. Let\u2019s just go over a list of Augustus\u2019s accomplishments so you get a sense of why he\u2019s always regarded as the greatest emperor Rome ever had: Politically outmaneuvered all rivals and established himself as the true heir of Julius Caesar, the greatest Roman in living memory, starting at the age of nineteenEnded the cycle of civil wars that first began with Marius and Sulla seventy years agoAssumed total control of the military, religion, and politicsAvoided using that total control, instead giving everyone and everything a great deal of autonomyReformed the unstable Republic into a stable imperial system that could withstand political crises and would not break into civil warsSomehow managed this while keeping most of the Republic\u2019s institutions intact and preserving the illusion of the RepublicEstablished a centralized tax system and paid the military using the central treasury, ensuring that all segments of the military remained loyal to RomeMaintained good relations with the people, the army, and the Senate, the three groups that all future emperors would struggle to balanceRooted out corruption within provincial administration to keep the provinces happy and loyal to Rome while reinvesting tax revenue into the provincesBuilt a massive network of roads to connect the empire, improve travel times, and enable more efficient administration/communicationPersonally commissioned building projects across the empire, including a forum in Rome, temples, aqueducts, bridges, and other public works projectsPushed for military campaigns that consolidated Rome\u2019s borders and established stable frontiers for defense against foreign invasionDirected much of his attention to finding a suitable successor to take his place as the head of state and governmentWhat other emperor managed all of this? Even if you could name a few who excelled in all of these aspects, you still have to place Augustus first because he did it all first. He created the imperial office from scratch, assembling its powers through constitutional agreements rather than by force, and integrated it smoothly into the Republic\u2019s existing institutions. His mastery of propaganda allowed him to preserve good relations with every constituent group he dealt with. And all the things he did \u2014 sponsoring building projects, winning military victories, stamping out corruption, and applying general diligence to the matters of ruling \u2014 made him the ideal model ruler to which future emperors would all aspire.  The Roman Emperors of the Principate Nothing is a more clear exposition of Augustus\u2019s immortal status than the name by which all future emperors of Rome called themselves. All of them would take the title of \u201cAugustus.\u201d ",
