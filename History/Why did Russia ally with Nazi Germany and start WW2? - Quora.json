            "answer_text": "First of all, it was the USSR, not Russia. In August 1939, just days before the German invasion of Poland the Soviets and Germany shocked the world - including the USSR and Germany - by signing the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. Publically the pact was a non-aggression pact between Germany and the USSR which was shocking enough, but, secret protocols associated with the pact went far beyond simple non-aggression. The Secret Protocols included: Agreements for both Germany and the USSR to invade Poland (German did so on September 1, 1939, and the USSR did on September 17, 1939).It created \u201cspheres of influence\u201d that allowed the USSR to invade Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, and parts of Roumania while giving German a free hand in Western Europe.It established trade relations that increased over time that provided Germany with badly needed food and raw materials while supplying the USSR with much-needed cash.After the non-aggression pact, the USSR used its influence with Communists in Western Europe and the Americas to undermine the war effort by portraying the war as a bourgeoises conflict that had nothing to do with the workers in the Allied nations. This resulted in acts of sabotage of war production undermining the will to fight of Allied nations. Similar tactics continue today. While neither Germany nor the USSR would call the other \u201cAlly\u201d, for all practical purposes they were, with the USSR overtly not interfering with the German war effort and covertly supporting it materially in numerous ways.
