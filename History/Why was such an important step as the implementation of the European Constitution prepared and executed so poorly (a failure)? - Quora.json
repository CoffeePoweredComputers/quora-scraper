            "answer_text": "Schuman formulated an important principle about supranational politics: New supranational structures only stand a chance of being accepted, if: A particular problem is defined clearly enough that the people recognize itIt is made clear that a supranational solution is the only one that has a chance of workingThe proposed constitution never made clear what the particular problem was, let alone proved clearly how the constitution was supposed to solve it. Both French and Dutch voter refused it. IMHO for good reasons. Supranationalism is not a goal in itself. It is a means to improve the lives of the citizens. Not a hobby of politicians who want to write themselves into the history books. The Lisbon Treaty is sometimes portrayed as a constitution-under-a-different name, but this ignores the fact that the very specific problem was widely recognized at the time: the decision making structures of the EU were not designed for the much larger numbers of member states. Another widely recognized problem was the so-called democratic deficit. Lisbon did much to mitigate those problems, but even then its acceptation was not without problems. There is another issue I should mention, because the person asking this question is probably an American. It is a rather typically American question: Europeans do not treat their constitutions as holy fetishes from which all wisdom flows. Americans often fall into that trap. It explains a lot about the rather sorry state of American politics today. ",

            "answer_text": "As someone who voted for the UK to \u201cleave\u201d my answer may surprise you in some ways, and may be just what you would expect in other ways. It really wasn\u2019t that much of an \u201cimportant step\u201d if the EU was based on the UK model - where we don\u2019t have a \u201cconstitution\u201d as found in France and the United States. But once it is decided that one is going to have that model of government, it is important that the \u201cconstitution\u201d makes it clear what the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the government is. Which is the reason why the EU constitution is, as you say, a failure on all aspects of what a \u201cconstitution\u201d is for. A real constition makes it possible to justify and implement both the \u201cjoining\u201d and the \u201cleaving\u201d of the \u201cstate\u201d. The EU is not really a \u201cstate\u201d - in the sense that Canada or France is a \u201cstate\u201d. It is just an excuse for \u201cselfishness\u201d. Compare, for example, the free trade agreement between the United States and Canada. Formerly enemies in 1812\u20131815, now allies with an \u201copen border\u201d that allows Canadian and American citizens like my relatives on both sides of the border to travel and trade freely across that border, where the only thing really stopping someone from illegally taking up employment without a visa in the \u201cother country\u201d for those in my family wihout dual \u201cNorth American\u201d citizenship is that they would usually be paying \u201csocial security\u201d taxes that would make it possible for their illegal working to be detected. Bear in mind of course that the US and Canada, unlike the member states of the EU, are in ALL respects, IDENTICAL in their fundamental \u201cconstitutions\u201d. With the two exceptions of the US being fundamentally more \u201crepublican\u201d and Canada being fundamentally more \u201cfederal\u201d. Both having a realistic expectation of what a \u201cfederal republic\u201d is supposed to be. In contrast, even the EU has to admit that no one in \u201cEurope\u201d really knows what the EU is supposed to be \u201cfor\u201d, other than for it\u2019s own selfish interests. Juncker ORDERS Europe: Don\u2019t hold any more referendums as voters will choose to LEAVE The \u00a39m pro-EU leaflet says just one thing: we\u2019re panicking | Dan Hannan The objective of European integration is held to be more important than the integrity of the democratic process \u2013 as the Greeks found after their referendum last year and, I suspect, as the Dutch, too, will find after their \u201cno\u201d vote this week. In the words of Jean-Claude Juncker: \u201cThere can be no democratic choice against the European treaties\u201d. Which is why it is so determined to \u201cpunish\u201d the UK for deciding to leave. Without even the reciprocal \u201cfree trade\u201d agreement and \u201copen border\u201d that a modern federal republic has a right to expect from it\u2019s neighbour. In the last 200 years since the United States invaded Canada, and was defeated in the attempt to make Canada part of the United States, there has been times when both Canadians and Americans have considered the possibility of a union. A union that, judging by their respective \u201cConstitution\u201d and \u201cAct of Constitution\u201d that has as it\u2019s purpose a REAL objective - the \u201ccommon wealth\u201d of a people, united only because it BENEFITS them. In other words, if either Quebec or Nova Scotia tell the \u201cConstitutional Congress\u201d in Philadelphia in 1776 that they do not see a \u201cbenefit\u201d in a union - this is a good enough reason not to be part of that union. The UK public has already told the EU that it does not see that supposed \u201cbenefit\u201d - other than by the THREAT that the UK will get even LESS than could reasonably be expected across the US-Canadian border. And of course the \u201cnon-mention\u201d of continued membership of the EEA, which is the ONLY thing that the UK voted to join in the first place. The voting public of France and Holland have also told the EU that they don\u2019t see a \u201cbenefit\u201d from the EU, when they rejected the \u201cconstitution\u201d that was \u201cforced\u201d on the UK by a German chancellor. Ian Traynor: Angela Merkel on the German passion for Europe When the French and the Dutch said no, the EU was thrust into a time of gloom officially dubbed a \"period of reflection\". That melancholy period is over, Merkel argues. Even the hypocritical leadership of Ireland and France can have \u201cproblems\u201d with the EU, when they are not themeselves criticising the UK for being \u201cdifficult\u201d. Macron vows to crackdown on immigration and cheap workers in EU Bitter divisions undermine Europe\u2019s digital tax plans For a constitution to work, it must clearly state what the \u201cbenefit\u201d is. Preamble to the United States Constitution - Wikipedia We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, In other words, there is nothing there that a Canadian would object to, and plenty that a Canadian would see as a benefit. That a Canadian gets anyway, without having to be part of the same union. Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe/Preamble intends to continue along the path of civilisation, progress and prosperity, for the good of all its inhabitantsit wishes to deepen the democratic and transparent nature of its public lifethe peoples of Europe are determined to transcend their former divisions and, united ever more closely, to forge a common destinySo to answer your question: Because the fundamental basis of the \u201cEuropean Union\u201d is ALL LIES. Not ALL of the inhabitants. As the people of the UK who voted to \u201cRemain\u201d are now beginning to realise, each time they blame the elected UK government for BOTH \u201cnot getting what it wants\u201d AND \u201cnot knowing what it wants\u201d from the unelected EU.Neither democratic nor transparent. The EU is fundamentally corrupt, bureaucratic, and partisan. It is virtually impossible to find anyone who voted to \u201cRemain\u201d who knows who his MEP is - or for that matter - who cares.This being the One Thing that no-one in the EU really wants. Other than those who have a RACIST view of \u201cwho should NOT be a European\u201d - like many people in Germany feel about the \u201cTurkish guest workers\u201d - or who somehow feel \u201cguilty by history\u201d for not implementing \u201cEuropean integration\u201d in a more \u201cpleasant manner\u201d - like many people in Germany or Iraly or Greece or France feel about the UK \u201chaving to liberate their country from the fascists\u201d.So let me remind you once again of my first statement. It wasn\u2019t an \u201cimportant step\u201d, and it didn\u2019t have to be an important step for either the US or for Canada. The essential thing is in the preamble - where the US and the Canadian versions talk about how the state serves the people, and not the other way around.
