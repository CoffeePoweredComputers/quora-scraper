            "answer_text": "The short answer is that not all American states have straight borders. This is the map of the Savannah River that divides South Carolina and Georgia:  Rivers are commonly used as state boundaries in the US. The United States is a fairly new country compared to places like Europe. Several states, particularly in the West, were defined by geographic coordinates rather than by the people who lived there over the centuries; those tend to be straight. Here is the \u201cFour Corners\u201d region of Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico:  So, the state boundaries in the US are straight lines, except when they aren\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "First, the premis of this question is incorrect. Majority of the states in the East do not have straight borders. There are two methods for drawing borders -   There's a geographical feature they're designed around - a river, mountain etc. For instance Missouri's eastern border is based on the Mississippi river, so you can see curves. They're designed arbitrarily where a group of people have decided this is where the border is. This is where you see straight borders, because they make the most sense.",
