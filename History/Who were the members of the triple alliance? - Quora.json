            "answer_text": "If you mean the War of the Triple Alliance from 1864 to 1870, then it was Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.  Paraguay's maniacal president Francisco Solano Lopez declared war on Brazil, who supported a Uruguayan party opposed to the one Lopez preferred.  Lopez also invaded Argentina in order to reach Brazil.  His invasion of Brazil failed, and the Triple Alliance invaded and devastated Paraguay.  Paraguay lost about half its population to battle, starvation, and disease.  Of the 221,000 Paraguayan survivors, fewer than 30,000 were adult males. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends what Triple Alliance is meant.[1] There is the Triple Alliance of 1596 between England, France, and the Dutch Republic to counter-balance against the rise of the Hapsburg dynasty in Spain and the Holy roman Empire. There is the Triple Alliance of 1668 between England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic to counter-balance against French expansionism in the decades after the decline of the Hapsburg dynasty. There is the Triple Alliance of 1717 between Great Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic to counter-balance against the return of Spanish power under the Bourbon dynasty.[2] There is the Triple Alliance of 1788 between Great Britain, Prussia, and the Dutch Republic to try and counter-balance against the growing power of the Russian Empire. There is the short-lived Triple Alliance of 1815 between Great Britain, France, and Austria to try and counter-balance against Russia and Prussia.[3] There is the Triple Alliance of 1882 between Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungry to try and counter-balance against growing French and British power. Note: By no means should this be taken as an exhaustive list; most treaties between three countries are known, at least somewhere, as the/a \"Triple Alliance\". [1] I am not going to assume, as I usually would, that the Question Topics are an accurate representation of the intent of the OP since they all seem to be added by QTB. [2] This is more widely known as the Quadruple Alliance since the Holy Roman Empire-- no longer of the same house as the ruling power in Spain-- would join a year later. [3] Austria would later flip sides and form the Holy Alliance with Russia and Prussia. ",
