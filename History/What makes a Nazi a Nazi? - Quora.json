            "answer_text": "Nazism was a product of the Interwar period, therefore one has to be careful when trying to apply its principles to societies of the 21st century. A lot of things have changed: for instance, there is no Soviet Union and no active global communist movement, of which Nazism was a mortal enemy. Economy is also very different worldwide. I'm not trying to say that there can be no Nazis today; on the contrary, one has to understand that 21st century Nazis (or Neonazis) are not necessarily identical with their \"ancestors\", although they more or less remain Nazis. Core Nazi ideological characteristics include: Racism (usually in the form of Aryan supremacy): Nazis believe that human beings are clearly divided into unequal races. They refuse to acknowledge that there can be no \"pure\" races, as history and science prove; they prefer a different reading of history instead, according to which most political, military and social phenomena are interpreted as results of the differences between the races (e.g. \"Alexander the Great conquered Asia because he was white, therefore superior to his enemies\"). They think that race-mixing is wrong to the point of prohibiting it, since it supposedly contaminates and undermines the superior race with the blood of the inferior. They end up considering these inferior races to be sub-humans, therefore they have no problem deprieving them of certain human rights, including the right to live, sometimes. Only a person of \"pure blood\" can be a citizen.F\u00fchrerprinzip and Opposition to democracy:  Since Nazis are against the concept of equality (even among members of the same race or nation), they believe that a country can be ruled well only by a pyramid-like hierarchical system; the system they imposed on Germany (1933-1945) was not an occasional choise, but it was well-founded on their ideology. It's a form of Totalitarianism, but I would say it even transcents it. They believe that there is need for a strong and usually ruthless leader, who will not hesitate before doing anything. They literally identify this leader with the country itself. In Germany, for example, it was said that \"Germany is the F\u00fchrer and the F\u00fchrer is Germany\". The F\u00fchrer's words were above any law and the members of the Armed Forces swore allegiance to him. That's the so-called \"F\u00fchrer principle\".Militarism, discipline and aggression: It was a Nazi tenet that a society is better run when it resembles and functions like a military camp. There is a strict social hierarchy and even private life itself is often militarized. There are paramilitary groups and uniformity is promoted everywhere. If Communism's vision was the socialization of the means of productions, Nazism's goal is the socialization of human beings. There is no private sphere left for the citizens; even their marriage or the way they raise their kids is determined by the state. Everyone has to obey blindly the orders he receives, otherwise he is considered a traitor. Children are taught to be tough, warlike, obedient and to embrace aggression much more than they let compassion rule their lives.Everything in service of the Volk and the Reich: Nothing, from science to religion to culture to arts, is permitted unless it serves the Volk (People) and the Reich (country). There is a certain unitarianism, that is. Religion is tolerated but only if it praises the superiority of the race and the idea of the Volk (the notion of the whole nation as a single entity, without partial interests). Art and culture are heavily censored if they attempt to express anything personal or private that deviates from the state ideology.Social Darwinism, eugenics: It's the notion that there are some people who do not have the right to live: it's the disabled, the invalid or the ill. The so-called survival of the fittest (a misinterpretation of Darwin's theory of evolution) is applied to the social context here. Abortions and euthanasia (often involuntary and obligatory) is promoted, whenever an genetic anomaly or race-mixing is the case.Mixed economy and corporatism: Nazis oppose both communism and capitalism (the first one more firmly). Certain industries are nationalized, while tariffs are imposed to minimize imports. At the same time, syndicates and unions are controlled by the state and certain corporations are backed by the government.Therefore, and without mentioning AfD or any other modern party, I think that whoever believes in racial superiority, rule by the strong (especially by a leader who personifies the whole nation), militarism, corporatism and social darwinism is a Nazi or at least a Neonazi.
