            "answer_text": "When the nail goes white at the end, that\u2019s where the blood stops flowing. This is dead keratin. Don\u2019t worry, this is completely normal. Animals\u2019 horns are made of dead keratin. If it were living, every time they would snap, they would bleed. Our nails are able to be trimmed at the white because it\u2019s dead, but if you cut the pink, it\u2019ll hurt and it might induce bleeding. I hope this answered your question! If you have any more questions, just feel free to ask! ",
