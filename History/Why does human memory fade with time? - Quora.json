            "answer_text": "We know that all resources in this universe are limited and so is the capacity of human brain. There has to be a limit up to which it can be used. Newer memories are contextually more important and also take more space because of excess details out of which irrelevant details vanish after some time. Imagine these excess details as loose links of a chain which tend to break easily. Apart from this our brain doesn't seem to have a very strong mechanism by which we can dictate what is important and has to be preserved forever and what is not and should be dumped right away. So it keeps memories in the short term region first, if we keep coming back to that memory frequently than it perceives it to be important and transfers it to long term region. For this, it shreds the loose links and just keep the main chain. That is why we are often advised to revise whatever we study on a regular basis to remember it for long time. Revision may also be in form of application (of the concept/idea/lesson). As time passes, the less important details of memories are being erased and only more important persist while we keep on registering new ones. Now using the above logic lets decode how can we manipulate our brain in a way to remember most details over a longer period. To remember anything for longer duration we must have a context and some motivation to remember it. We need to take care of such loose links and foster them in some way. Like its always easy to remember some story as compared to random details. This trick is used by memory masters to remember a great set of details for very long time and they call it \u201cMemory Palace\u201d. Imagine you need to buy 5 grocery items but you don\u2019t have any means to write out the list and the only option is to remember it. To help in such scenario, remember a familiar space for e.g. your living room. Now imagine each item you need to buy on some specific places in a particular order (and also possibly a made up story) and remember this series. It will get much easier now to remember it. In this way they link those random parts or the loose links of the chain and associate them with the main chain thereby fostering them. Now, by only memorizing the new chain they include much more information than before. This may not always be feasible everywhere. I have used a similar trick to learn Organic Chemistry (which is very volatile just like its compounds) by looking at same reaction/compounds etc. from different perspectives. So it improves the understanding and fosters the connection by using two different chains which are laid parallel to each other and are interlinked at regular intervals. So even if one breaks, I can reach to same point by the other one. My answer is based upon several articles and my understanding of human brain. This may not be 100% correct. ",

            "answer_text": "Memory is state dependent. Your mind state and the information in your brain at any given time will be related to all the other information. When you change your external location or the various inputs going into your brain, your mind state changes and since your mind is not in the previous state, retrieval of information becomes more difficult. You may not be able to retrieve a lot of your memories from high school, but if you pick up an old high school yearbook and page through it, you will find that a lot of things that happened during that time will come back into your memory. The theory of holographic memory suggests that electromagnetic energy in your brain creates holographic interference patterns (or holograms) in your brain. In order to recover the memories associated with those interference patterns, you have to generate patterns similar to those memory patterns and gradually as your brain recruits more and more rhythms similar to those from older me3mories, the memories will come back.
