            "answer_text": "Yes. It already has to a very dangerous extent. But the Rodale Institute in the US is claiming sucess with field scale Organic No-Till techniques that look very good from their promotional material. I think it is fair to describe that system as \u201cindustrial farming\u201d and although all farming alters ecosystems this approach seems relatively benign. This talk on how to fight desertification and reverse climate change http://go.ted.com/tZyc1w describes how an argyably intensive \u201cindustrialised approach\u201d can actually engineer improved ecology. This is the reverse of conventional industry (grain fed) practices. There are other aporoaches like Masanobu Fukuoka\u2019s Natural Farming but they operate on a much more human rather than industrial scale. ",

            "answer_text": "yes, as any agriculture system. Agriculture is a by nature anti-natural and change totally the ecosystem. As soon as you take a dog with you to protect yourself from beast you change the ecosystem and destroy the past one for a new one. Has soon has you plant one seed in one chosen place you destroy the ecosystem for a new one. But it could be in a good way. In the last 20 years a new way of agriculture has born and is really changing everything.  ",
