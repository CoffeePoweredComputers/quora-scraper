            "answer_text": "The answer to this can be given very simply. In ancient Greek there was no word for \u201cblond\u201d. The word which is commonly alleged to mean \u201cblond\u201d, \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u00f3\u03c2, /ksanthos/, actually means \u201cbrown\u201d as the use of its derivative, \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u00ed\u03b6\u03c9, /ksanthidzo/, at Aristophanes, Acharnians, 1047, very clearly shows \u2014 \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u00ed\u03b6\u03c9 there means \u201cto turn brown\u201d by means of roasting (i.e. meat, which does not turn yellow or blond when it is roasted). To my knowledge there is only one passage in all extant Greek literature in which an author unequivocally speaks of blond hair. Diodorus Siculus, V 32,2. \u201cThe women of the Gauls are not only like to the men in respect of stature, but are their equals in point of valour also. Their children at birth for the most part are \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u00f3\u03c2 [/polios/; the word refers to hair colour], but as they grow older they change the colour to that of their parents.\u201d What was the colour of their parents\u2019 hair? D.S. V 28,1 \u201cThe Gauls are tall as to their bodies, with rippling-muscled and white skin, but they are \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u00f3\u03c2 as to their hair\u2026\u201d The words \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u00f3\u03c2 and \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u00f3\u03c2, which we\u2019ll leave untranslated for now, both denote a specific colour of hair; in this passage Diodorus (or more precisely, probably, his source whom he is copying, but in the current context that is neither here nor there) is discussing the common phenomenon among peoples of northern Europe whereby young children\u2019s hair is light, but often turns darker as they age. (My own children, for example, all had blond hair initially; that of the two elder is now definitely brown.) Please note that Diodorus calls the darker colour \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u00f3\u03c2 and the lighter colour \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u00f3\u03c2. Now \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u00f3\u03c2, as the passage from Aristophanes shows, means \u201cbrown\u201d; and Diodorus is self-evidently using \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u00f3\u03c2 to mean \u201cblond\u201d. The problem is that \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u00f3\u03c2 actually means \u201cgrey\u201d \u2014 in all other instances this word refers to the colour of old people\u2019s hair (LSJ, s.v.). Diodorus simply did not have a word which meant \u201cblond\u201d in his vocabulary. He could describe the parents\u2019 darker hair with the word \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u00f3\u03c2, \u201cbrown\u201d, but the best he could do for the lighter colour, i.e. blond hair, was \u201cgrey\u201d. That was the closest word for a type of hair colour for which he just didn\u2019t have a word, and there wasn\u2019t a word for it in his language because the Greeks themselves didn\u2019t have blond hair and (at least until they got to know Celts) didn\u2019t know anyone who did. Even brown hair among the ancient Greeks was a rarity, by the way, and a brown-haired person might easily pick up the name \u039e\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u00f3\u03c2 in much the same way as a red-head today can pick up the nickname \u201cred\u201d. (\u03a0\u03c5\u03c1\u03c1\u00f3\u03c2, \u201cred\u201d, exists as a name in Greek as well.) Almost all ancient Greeks had black hair; the brown-heads and red-heads among them actually attracted attention on account of their rarity. Very unfortunately the view that the ancient Greeks had blond hair (or at all events prized blond hair) has a certain history in na\u00efve older scholarship which was then used in perverted pseudo-scholarship which we here need not discuss; but one can easily guess its nature.

But they certainly idolised blond hair and they preferred it to other colours, so many of the gods and heroes in mythology are described as blond.
