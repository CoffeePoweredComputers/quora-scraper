            "answer_text": "My intention in this answer is to describe one of the most important events in the entire Old Testament \u2014 when the nation Israel, so wondrously blessed by God, is torn in two parts. You could say it happened almost immediately after King Solomon\u2019s death. The first verse of 1 Kings 12, already alerts us to the presence of deep trouble in the nation. The ten northern tribes of Rehoboam\u2019s kingdom (Rehoboam was Solomon\u2019s son and rightful heir to the throne) had evidently made it clear that they didn\u2019t regard him as their king simply because he had ascended to the throne in Jerusalem. They wanted to meet and deliberate with him and, if all went well, accept him as their king. The representatives of the ten northern tribes were not even willing to go to Jerusalem, which was the religious and political center of the nation. They had decided they would meet at Shechem, a place associated with renewal (Gen.35:1\u20134; Josh.24:1,14\u201328). Perhaps they were hoping it would prove to be the place of renewal of the bond between themselves and the house of David ? When Rehoboam arrived in Shechem, he found Jeroboam to be the spokesman (1 Kings 12:2\u20133). Jeroboam made it clear that the ten northern tribes of Israel were not satisfied merely to have Rehoboam come to Shechem. Before they would accept him as their king, they must have his firm assurance that he would lighten the heavy load of taxation and forced labor, that his father Solomon had placed upon them (12:4), which Rehoboam refused to do. In fact, after seeking bad advice, Rehoboam promised that rather than lighten the heavy load of taxation and forced labor, he would add to the burden his father Solomon had placed upon the people. Solomon, he said, had whipped them with whips, but he would use \u201cscorpions\u201d \u2014 that is, whips with sharp pieces of metal attached (12:14). If Rehoboam thought Jeroboam and the ten northern tribes of Israel would be intimidated by his tough talk about scorpions, he was in for a rude surprise. The people responded by saying \u201cwhat share have we in David? We have no inheritance in the Son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! See to your own house O David!\u201d (12:16). It was on this grievous day, that the kingdom of Israel divided into two. Ten tribes who lived up North with Samaria as the capital city (called Israel), and two tribes in the southern part of the kingdom with Jerusalem as the capital city (called Judah). All \u2018Jews\u2019, but now a divided house, and we all know what happens to a house divided. If we look only at the politics of this situation, we might find ourselves siding with the ten northern tribes. Their request appears to have been very reasonable, and their pledge to give their support if their request was met, seems to have been utterly sincere (12:4). The problem with their position however, lies in their ignoring the spiritual dimension of being connected with the house of David. The Lord had established a special covenant with David. He had promised a permanence for David\u2019s house, that could be achieved only by the coming of the Messiah (2 Samuel 7:16 ; Genesis 49:8). But, another factor to consider in this division, is that it was the Lord God who had promised to divide his kingdom ( 1 Kings 11:31). In other words, this division was primarily due to the fact that the Lord God had ordained it. There can be no doubt about this. The author puts it bluntly \u201c\u2026 the turn of events was from the Lord \u2026\u201d (12:15), and this same truth was affirmed by the Lord Himself, when he said through his prophet \u201cthis thing is from me\u201d (12:24). Why did the Lord design and orchestrate the division of the very kingdom he had so wondrously blessed ? It was because both Solomon and his subjects had turned from him to worship and serve idols (see 1 Kings 11:33 ff). It is important to remember that Jeroboam came to the throne of the northern kingdom of Israel with a distinct promise from God \u201cIf you do whatever I command you and walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you. I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David and will give Israel to you. I will humble David\u2019s descendants because of this, but not forever\u201d (1 Kings 11:38,39). 2 Kings 17:1\u201323 records the death of the northern ten tribes \u2014 the nation of Israel, with Samaria as its capital city. The author encapsulates the death of Israel (the northern ten tribes) in these words \u201cNow the king of Assyria went through all the land, and went up to Samaria and beseiged it for three years. In the ninth year of Hoshea (Israel\u2019s last king), the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria \u2026\u201d (2 Kings 17:5\u20136). The cause of the death of the northern kingdom of Israel (the ten tribes) was basically disobedience to God\u2019s laws (see the long list in 2 Kings 17:7\u201312, 16\u201317). A mere glance at this long list, is sufficient to see that Israel\u2019s primary sin was idolatry. She gave to idols, the devotion and service that belonged to God alone. God had been very good to Israel, and yet she went after idols. And then there was refusal to hear God\u2019s word. (2 Kings 17:13\u201314). God would have been justified in sending judgement upon Israel as soon as she began practicing disobedience. But in tender love and mercy he refused to do so. Instead he sent prophet after prophet to warn the people about their sin of idolatry and the destruction it would inevitably bring. They were called time and again to \u201creturn to the Lord\u201d (Hosea 14:1\u20132,4\u20135) but they wouldn\u2019t listen \u201cthey stiffened their necks like the necks of their fathers, who did not believe in the Lord their God\u201d (2 Kings 17:14). Thus, \u201cthe Lord removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets\u201d (1 Kings 17:23). Israel had followed the ways of the heathen nations that God had used her to drive out of Canaan. And now, God uses a heathen nation to drive Israel out of the land. Through this judgment, God essentially said to Israel, \u2018You cannot be partially like the heathen nations. You must be totally like them. If you insist on sharing their sins, you must also experience their judgement\u2019 (See Leviticus 18:26\u201328). Ultimately the ten northern tribes were assimilated into the Arab nations around about them, and many became known as \u2018Samaritans\u2019 (very much hated by the Jews in Jesus\u2019 day). The \u2018Samaritans\u2019 were descended from the intermarriage of Assyrian colonists and the remnant Jewish population of the Northern kingdom of Israel in the years after its destruction in 722 B.C. The Samaritans had adopted a truncated form of the Old Testament religion, recognizing only the Pentateuch as the Word of God. They \u2018feared the Lord\u2019 but also served their idols (see 2 Kings 17:24\u201341). When, after 586 B.C. Judah herself returned from the exile ( Jews of the southern Kingdom of Judah) in Babylon, the Samaritans opposed the rebuilding of the Temple (Nehemiah 4 : 1\u20132). They subsequently built their own Temple on Mt Gerazim, but this was later destroyed in 108 B.C. by the Maccabean rulers of Israel. The Jews always regarded the Samaritans as heretics and despised them as inferior beings. It is this, of course, that gives such dramatic power to Jesus\u2019 parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:25\u201337). ",

            "answer_text": "The Jewry has evolved significantly through the ages, as most peoples and cultures do. If your approach leans more to the traditional, you may be imagining that the peoples that we identify as \u201cJews\u201d descended from a perfect succession as far back as their single ancestor or tribe of origin. However, by doing that, we only complete more or less 1/2 of the puzzle as we also need to check with historical data and see if the puzzle pieces fit. According to modern scholarship on the history, archaeology and authentic records depicting the events of Ancient Israel\u2019s time frame, some time around 8th century BCE Assyria annexed the northern kingdom of Israel, or Samaria, to their empire as a tributary kingdom or state. As part of their annexation campaign as well as to quell possible rebellions from client kingdoms, Assyria did something revolutionary at the time which was the deportation of populations. The elite groups from Israel were relocated to Assyria, gradually replacing the loss in Israelite population with the non-elites of Assyria. The exchange of workforce was to weaken Ancient Israel as a unique nation and to exploit the elite captives\u2019 capabilities for Assyria\u2019s own good. What happened to the deported groups remained a mystery, thus giving way to the concept of The Ten Lost Tribes. One of the most accepted theories that I think is also probable is assimilation. The said peoples, save for the Judeans, simply assimilated or gradually blended in to the societies or culture outside of the land of Ancient Israel. Wherever their descendants are now, they are likely to be scattered all over the world. The question on the Judean origins of modern day Jews is a challenging one and is best to be answered differently, and most of the time subjectively. Like the earlier premise, all throughout Judaism\u2019s history, it went through series of changes, opening the possibility of meeting a present-day non-Jew that might actually be from the Ancient Judean bloodline. That said, it is also possible that someone who is Jewish today might not even be from the said bloodline or ancestry. This is because time came in history when Jews accepted converts (even from the gentile peoples) in the hopes of restoring the twelve tribes again. The only price to pay is the homage to the Jewish religious tenets and customs. Given these data, it\u2019s likely that the answer to your Jews being pure descendants of the Judeans question is \u201clikely not\u201d owing to the fact that there are challenges in identifying what a Jew is.
