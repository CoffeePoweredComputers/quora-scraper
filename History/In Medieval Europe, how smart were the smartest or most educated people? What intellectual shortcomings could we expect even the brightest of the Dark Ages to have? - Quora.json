            "answer_text": "Reading and writing were the preserve ONLY of the Rich landed Nobility and of \u201cHoly Mother Church\u201d. Ordinary men and women and children who worked in villages, towns or as servants could NOT read or write. This situation amongst the \u201ccommon people\u201d generally persisted for over a thousand years. During what\u2019s known as the Dark Ages, and the era of the local tribes and war Lords and small kingdoms, intellectual quality was not the preserve of most people. Some Kingdoms or small Dukedoms, were better organised and preserved Traditions better than others. But Language study, Art and Written Literature were very rare in most societies, since the collapse of Romes\u2019 Empire. Waves of barbarians swept down through Europe, later settling and forming new Kingdoms as far afield as Spain. Queen Brunhild came from Visigoth\u2019s who had settled in Spain. She had a Kingdom in Southern France, but was constantly at war with another Kingdom, who had murdered her sister, and trying to defeat them for all her life. She had a Castle at Bruniquel, its still there today. Brunhilda (c. 543\u2013613) was Queen Consort of Austrasia, part of Francia, by marriage to the Merovingian king Sigebert I of Austrasia, and regent for her son, grandson and great grandson. In her long and complicated career she ruled the eastern Frankish kingdoms of Austrasia and Burgundy for three periods as regent for her son Childebert II from 575 until 583; her grandson Theudebert II from 595 until 599; and great-grandson Sigebert II in 613. The period was marked by tension between the royal house and the powerful nobles vying for power. Brunhilda was apparently an efficient ruler, but this and her forceful personality brought her into conflict with her nobles, the church, and the other Merovingians. Her bitter feud with Fredegund, mistress of Chilperic I of Neustria, who murdered Brunhilda's sister, Queen Galswintha, c. 568 in order to replace her as queen, lasted until Fredegund's death in 597. Fredegund had Brunhilda's husband murdered and Brunhilda imprisoned for a period. This feud was continued by Fredegund's son, Chlothar II, who in 613 defeated Brunhilda in battle and had her executed by being pulled apart by four horses. Legend says Brunhild is buried up on the Mountain, in a cave, overlooking her Castle down to this day. I believe the legend to be true.  Queen Brunhild sadly came to a very bad unhappy end, when defeated in battle, her enemies had her punished and torn apart by four horses\u2026.  The murder of Brunhilda, from De Casibus Virorum Illustrium, attributed to Ma\u00eetre Fran\u00e7ois, Paris, c. 1475  Chateaux Bruniquel. Brunhilds ancient castle from which she ruled.   Brunhild, also spelled Brynhild, Brunhilda, Brunhilde, or Br\u00fcnhild, a beautiful Amazon-like princess in ancient Germanic heroic literature, known originally from Old Norse sources (the Edda poems and the V\u01eblsunga saga) and from the Nibelungenlied in German and more recently from Richard Wagner\u2019s late 19th-century opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (\u201cThe Ring of the Nibelung\u201d), adapted from the Nibelungenlied. In the Eddic poems in which she appears, Brunhild plays the leading role. In the Nibelungenlied, because of a shift of emphasis, her prominence is greatly reduced.  Behrens, Hildegarde Soprano Hildegarde Behrens singing the role of Brunhild in a production of Siegfried, part of the opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen by Richard Wagner. Love, Mystery, a Supernatural Tragedy in the Dark Ages. Common to both, and no doubt original, is the conception of Brunhild as the central figure of a story in which she vows to marry only a man of the most outstanding qualities and one that can surpass her in strength. One man, Siegfried, is able to fulfill her conditions, but he woos and wins her not for himself but for another. When Brunhild discovers this deception, she exacts vengeance, which results in the death of Siegfried.  Nibelungenlied: SiegfriedSiegfried, illustration from a printing of Nibelungenlied. VALKYRIE. In some of the Norse sources, Brunhild has supernatural qualities and is described as a Valkyrie; it is still a matter of dispute whether these attributes are an accretion or whether their absence from the German version is an omission. Many critics, who doubt their originality in the Norse, seek the source of the poetic figure in the history of the Merovingian kings of the Franks, in which Queen Brunhild plays an important part; the name is also found in place-names and field names in the region of the Rhine and in north eastern France and Belgium, but this could have resulted from the popularity of the literary figure. Only Local leaders or Kings and Queens had enough wealth to access what Literature or Art or Music or culture still existed. As with modern society \u201cthe rich are always all-right\u201d. But ordinary people lived very frugal, hard, unhealthy and simple often rather primitive lives. much of their life got used up getting after, looking after animals, and working on the land to grow food.

Above. this Southern Occitanian or Languedoc soldier has an Arbalete or crossbow; Modern society has forgotten these things. If society ever were to collapse again, as it did before with Rome, then not many would survive because they would have no skills to adapt and make their support, food, water, and housing etc to survive.

Where you must bake your own bread? And where the only transport is just your own two worn feet? Only the rich could afford to have Horses. Imagine where there are NO proper roads or signposts? And the countryside around you is still mostly in fact large Forests? Imagine staying in your town or village and not travelling much more than a few miles from it in all your lifetime? Imagine a world where dangerous warlike tribes , rival rulers and kingdoms may attack your town and Queen or King at any moment? Where Wild Bears or Boars or Wolves sometimes come out the Forest hunting you? Where you could die from a bad tooth because there was no proper medicine or health care? Welcome to the Dark Ages. How The Irish Saved Civilization: The Untold Story of Ireland's Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe is a non-fiction historical book written by Thomas Cahill. I have read his book, and can fully comprehend the situation in dark Age Europe and just how this came into being. Cahill argues a case for theirish Celtic peoples 's critical role in preserving Western European Civilization from utter destruction by the Hunes and the Barbarian Germanic and Non Germanic tribes, (Visigoths, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Ostrogoths, etc.). The book retells the story from the collapse of the Roman Empires power on the Continent, and the pivotal role played by members of the church, Monks and Clergy at the time. A particular focus is placed upon Saint Patrick and retells his early struggles through slavery; basically retelling portions of The Confession of Saint Patrick. Early parts of the book examine Ireland before Patrick and the role of Saint Augustine of Canterbury Particular focus is placed upon Saint Columba and the monks he trained and the monasteries he set up in the Hiberno-Scottish mission. These holy men, according to Cahill, \"single-handedly refounded European civilization throughout the continent I find that I agree with Cahills observations, and description of society and the times. His findings fit closely to those of my own History, Archaeology and Academic studies and examination of events. The Dark Ages can be both primitive, and violent, a mixture of the \u201cIron\u201d of local ruled society\u2019s , with its feet of \u201cClay\u201d set in the primitive Forest type Superstitions, simple living condition, Religions, superstitions and fears; yet one also finds a blinding flashing light of inspiration and hope. Echo\u2019s of the past rebounding across to the future. In Ireland, Monastry\u2019s set up University\u2019s\u2019 to teach people in Writing, Literature and other skills, which they then travelled with, and took back to heir own lands. One of these ancient \u201cSchools\u201d founded by travelling Religious Monks from Ireland, eventually became the Paris University of the \u201cSORBONNE\u201d.  Ancient Irish monastry\u2019s preserved manuscripts, and taught languages, even as the Roman Empire fell, and Dark Ages began. it was from origins such as these that we today owe much of our knowledge, ancient art, and other history. Ancient manuscripts such as the wonderful Book of Kell\u2019s were preserved by Irish Monks.  An illustration from the Irish book of Kells. And Books were in very short supply, and ONLY the rich or the church could afford to pay for any. Maps of roads and knowledge of how to get from one place even to the nearest big town, were only owned by the Lords or high officials. And not many maps existed or were very accurate\u2026 Inside the Church, the Bible, was considered the Absolute Word of God. People in church or privately in their own chapel at their castle or manor, used \u201cPrayer Wheels\u201d, or instructions for prayer to God.  Above. A Medieval prayer Wheel is over a thousand years old, nobody today can quite work out how exactly to use it. Popular Superstitions and irrational beliefs abounded everywhere, and even towns or cities could be dangerous at night; people had only candles for light and stayed \u201cunder curfew\u201d locked inside their houses at night. Night watchmen with dogs patroll\u2019d the streets or towns. Wolves, Wild Boars and Bears still lived in Europe and even England. Sometimes they came near houses looking for food. In Medieval times the ringing of the curfew bell was of such importance that land was occasionally paid for the service. There are even recorded instances where the sound of the curfew bell sometimes saved the lives of lost travellers by safely guiding them back to town. Footpads, and outlaws , robbers, were also a danger. Finally after some centuries, the dark ages began to \u201clift slowly\u201d into the late part, or the Middle Ages, the Medieval part. Life was still hard, but things did begin gradually to change. But it was a long process. And took many more years yet\u2026 The curfew bell was a bell rung in the evening in Medieval England as the Curfew signal for everyone to go to bed. A bell was rung usually around eight o'clock in the evening which meant for them to cover their fires - deaden or cover up, not necessarily put out altogether. \u201cThe Watch\u201d.  If you were found \u201cout after Curfew\u201d it was a most serious offence. Below. Cadfael, Monk turned Medieval Detective, seeks the truth. The Medieval towns Sergeant investigates with him and gathers evidence of the robbing and then Murder of Churchman and Diplomat Peter Clemence. Travelling, even if armed with sword and a fast horse, was not safe in medieval times.  The usual procedure was at the sound of the curfew bell the burning logs were removed from the centre of the hearth of a warming fire and the hot ashes swept to the back and sides. The cold ashes were then raked back over the fire so as to cover it. The ashes would then keep smouldering giving warmth without a live fire going. The fire could easily be reignited the next morning by merely adding logs back on and allowing air to vent through the ashes. I\u2019ve actually try\u2019d this in an big old fireplace in a ancient old house (with close attention!) and it really does work. A benefit of covering up the fire in the evening was the prevention of destructive conflagrations caused by unattended live fires, a major concern since at the time most structures were made of wood and burned easily. Voltaire, in his Universal History, notes the curfew bell acted as an ancient police on fire prevention in towns of the northern hemisphere.  Above picture. A typical Medieval town or city street, with its assorted different citizens, Merchants, lords lady\u2019s and servants. Note the poor cripple begging for Money on the left. \u201clex mercatoria,\u201d or Not? The Uniquely English use of the 13th Century term, \u201claw merchant\u201d. This is misleading, because 16th century Historians decided that it meant a whole regulated and structured legal as well as rigid Feudal system existed (just because someone in Britain used the term!!). Certainly lords, vassals and the system did exist, but it has been quietly suspected for decades, until sometime around 1973 or 4 that feudalism was not the accepted form it has come to be perceived. To say, in effect, it may not have been so all \u201cprevalent\u201d after all in all societies or parts. The \u201cLittle red Book of Bristol\u201d. Despite the meaning it would take on , because certain \u201cexperts\u201d made ex cathedra, Dogmatic assertions about it, in the future, this 13th-century \u201claw merchant\u201d did not refer to a uniform blanket, and universal merchant-created or managed custom. The famous Little Red Book of Bristol, the late 13th-century book describing the law merchant, focused on the procedure of fair, market, and port courts. It did not, however, discuss substantive commercial law, which is quite a separate matter. Merovingian Queen Bithild (Saint Balthild). *Bathilda *Baudour*  That sort of bastardisation of historical fact, is what you get when 16th century lawyers are looking for something to write to make money. Rather the same situation I am afraid can exist, when , today, certain \u201cexperts\u201d write a \u201cpaper\u201d which then gets too easily (and financially rewarded and accoladed) that states theory as given \u201cfact\u201d when quite frankly it is not fat at all. Academic methods of Financial reward are partly to blame, I feel for this error. Archaeology of the Medieval Period must not become the arena of stated but not well founded or well supported or evidenced \u201cfact\u201d. The Discovery in medieval Norwich of a ladys merchant Seal Ring, which over turned strongly \u201casserted\u201d ideas about medieval women being \u201cforbidden from running or managing her own Trade or business\u201d is one very good case in point. Dogmatic expressed cynicism, surrounding the recent Discovery of a Gold Seal Ring of Merovingian French Queen Balthild, just 7 km from modern day Norwich, despite her being known to be the Anglo Saxon relative of a English ruler) is another strong case in point.  Below; The Music and Dance was rather good, if only you had the Money !!   Rich people enjoyed the best life in the Medieval ages.The rest of the world had to work for them, ploughing their fields, shoeing their horses, hunting their meat, fetching and carrying their water\u2026;and dyeing drafted into to fight in the great many local wars\u2026  Many Local wars and Military disputes occurred in medieval times. many lords and young men died in battle. Defeated Lords often had their lands and castles declared \u201cforfeit\u201d and confiscated by the Victors. In Medieval times, if you lived in Wells but you had got to Bristol, \u201cyou have REALLY REALLY LIVED !!! And that was only around thirty Miles away.  Writers and poets such as Shakespeare were amongst the cleverest people. Ambitious Kings, such as the \u201cPretender\u201d Steven who had himself crowned in Norman England, leading to a period sometimes referred to as \u201cthe Anarchy\u201d when Empress Maude of France, rightful heir to the throne of Norman England, fought a bitter civil war in England against Steven the pretender. finally, her son succeeded, and started the Angevine Empire.  Some Entertainers, Travelling Musicians or \u201cMinstrels\u201d found work and sometimes Love, by travelling from town to town. Most people NEVER went farther than a Mile or two from their village or town all of their lifetime long. And in any case, did not know usually, the way to get there. This persisted in England up to the time of the English civil war, when many lost recruits starved, when getting hopelessly lost in the countryside, not knowing how to get home again. Sometimes food harvests were poor, bread was scarce, and there was a Famine.   Above. Different kinds of Medieval Farmers. The cleverest people included Writers, Poets, Artists and sculptors, and designers and builders of Churches and Europe\u2019s great cathedrals and castles. And some but by no means all Kings and Queens and Military leaders.  Cunning scheming Lords and rich powerful ladies ruled. And arranged marriages to acquire fortunes of money and land.  Rich young ladies were victims of Political \u201carranged marriages\u201d and had NO CHOICE except to \u201cobey\u201d. Even if clear against their wishes. Lords and High Ranking Church Bishops held power in the lands. Lords had usually many paying \u201ctenant farmers\u201d or other workers living in their rented houses. Abbeys also rented houses to others as a additional means of income for church needs. Below; this is one representation of the medieval feudal System.  Lords of the Middle Ages were those who leased land or other property to an individual or many individuals. Usually lords had more than one tenant on their property. In the Middle Ages one had to be of good or high nobility before he could even be considered a lord. Lordship could also be conferred by a King as a reward for Military or other good service rendered to them or their cause. Lords and Nobility all had Heraldic Devices or Shield symbols, that stood for their \u201chouse\u201d and Noble \u201cTitle\u201d (or titles, they might have many ) Lords leased property to a vassal, who then paid them and was responsible to them. Lords and vassals existed under the feudal system. Today, a lord would be the equivalent of a rich private landlord. Definition Lord is a respectful title for a person, almost always male, who has authority or power over others. It can also be used in respect to a religious deity. There are not many times in which \u201clord\u201d is an official title. However, in the Middle Ages during the feudal system, \u201cLord of the Manor\u201d was often used to denote someone who was in control of land. Also the term \u201coverlord\u201d was used, to describe a Lord who is a higher authority over another lesser lord who had say, a manor in the countryside, on land owned by them. In Shrewsbury, ( Shropshire) in the Middle Ages, one of the \u201cOverlords\u201d was the Earl of Chester, a large town some thirty miles or so away. The Feudal System Lords of the Middle Ages have varied meanings under the feudal system. Overlords were those whose manors were held by a mesne lord or vassal. This was under different forms of feudal land tenure agreements. This is where a landlord would be similar today. A liege lord was someone to whom a vassal owed services and allegiance. These were not social constructs, but rather the vassal swore an oath to the liege lord that he would always uphold these two duties. Sometimes a lord played the role of both vassal and lord. For example, he might be a vassal to the king but a lord to a knight. Several of my ancestors come from \u201cVERMANDOIS de VERMANDOIS\u201d of Normandie, dating from before William of Normandie\u2019s Conquest of England and the taking back of the rightful Crown. Norman England after 1066. Lord of the Manor Following the Norman Conquest of 1066 and the establishment of Feudalism, the title of \u201cLord of the Manor\u201d was established. The title of Lord of the Manor is a supposed feudal overseer who gained power through a court baron or manorial court. Lords of the Manor or their stewards appeared at court. Lords of the Manor had power over their tenants to the points of being able to execute them if the tenants misbehaved in a way that displeased their lord. Lords had authority of high, Middle and low Justice and over \u201ctheir own servants\u201d or \u201csurfs\u201d. One of my Ancestors was Baron De Percy.  Armorials of Percy ancient: Azure, five fusils conjoined in fesse or These arms are still quartered by the Dukes of Northumberland, but were superseded c. 1300 by the adoption by Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy (d.1314) of the arms Or, a lion rampant azure, the source for which is variously given as the \"Lion of Brabant\",the extinct arms of Redvers, Earls of Devon, or the Lion of Arundel combined with the tinctures of Warenne 1316: 2nd Baron Percy Henry De Percy, the Second Baron de Percy who was granted the lands of Patrick IV, Earl of March, in Northumberland, by Edward II in 1316, began to improve the size and defences of the castle. He was appointed to Edward III's Council in 1327 and was given the manor and castle of Skipton. Was granted, by Edward III, the castle and barony of Warkworth in 1328. He was at the siege of Dunbar and the Battle of Halidon Hill and was subsequently appointed constable of Berwick Upon Tweed . In 1346, Henry commanded the right wing of the English Army which defeated a larger Scottish force at the Battle of Neville's Cross. His son, Henry de Percy, 3rd Baron Percy married Mary of Lancaster an aunt of John of Gaunt\u2019s s (John of Ghent*) wife Blanche of Lancaster. In 1377, the next Henry Percy was created Earl of Northumberland, which title he was given after the coronation of Richard II. Nor was this all, for he was that Northumberland whose doings in the next reign fill so large a part of Shakespeare's Henry IV, and he was the father of the most famous Percy of all, Henry Percy the fifth, better known as \"Hotspur\". Hotspur never became Earl of Northumberland, having been slain at Shrewsbury in the lifetime of his father, whose estates were forfeited under attainder on account of the rebellion of himself and his son against King Henry IV. Henry V restored Hotspur's son, the second Earl, to his family honours, and the Percys were staunch Lancastrians during the Wars of the Roses which followed, the third Earl and three of his brothers losing their lives in the cause. The fourth Earl was involved in the political manoeuvrings of the last Yorkist kings Edward IV and Richard III. Through either indecision or treachery he did not respond in a timely manner at the Battle of Bosworth Field, and thus helped cause his ally Richard III's defeat at the hands of Henry Tudor (who became Henry VII). In 1489, he was pulled from his horse and murdered by some of his tenants. The fifth Earl displayed magnificence in his tastes, and being one of the richest magnates of his day, kept a very large household establishment. Henry Percy, the sixth Earl of Northumberland, loved Anne Boleyn, and was her accepted suitor before Henry VIII married her. He married later to Mary Talbot, the daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury, but as he died without a son, his nephew Thomas Percy became the seventh Earl. Thereafter, a succession of plots and counterplots\u2014the Rising of the North, the plots to liberate Mary Queen of Scots, and the Gunpowder Plot \u2013 each claimed a Percy among their adherents. On this account the eighth and ninth Earls spent many years in the Tower, but the tenth Earl, Algernon, fought against King Charles in the Civil War, the male line of the Percy-Louvain house ending with Josceline, the eleventh Earl. The heiress to the vast Percy estates married the Duke of Somerset; and her granddaughter married a Yorkshire knight, Sir Hugh Smithson, who in 1766 was created the first Duke of Northumberland and Earl Percy, and it is their descendants who now represent the famous old house. The current duke lives at Alnwick Castle and Svon House just outside London. Fear of going to Hellfire and Damnation was a prevalent shortcoming during the Middle Ages, and the Church, eager to receive a dyeing Lord or Lady\u2019s riches and lands, was \u201cexpert at Deploying satan and the fear of him and his Demon servants everywhere\u201d to make sure they got them safely in its treasury chests. The church grew fat with land and Gold from frightened people, who they had convinced would face assured damnation if they displeased \u201cGod\u201d (read didn't give their goods and land to the church).  \u201cThen you will surely Go to hell where there are giant Demons and Fiery Flames and your Torment shall be unceasing\u201d! \u201cThen I give all my land to the church\u201d\u2026.\u201dGod Bless you Sir for heaven is assured for you\u2026.\u201d The church was a racketeering money grabbing operation when it came to getting a dyeing lord or lady\u2019s house and land and money. The church, whil\u2019st it did preserve manuscripts, Much history and art and spoken and sung tradition, also stopped ordinary people from learning or widening too much their education or comprehension that their just might be \u201cother viewpoints\u201d not in accord with the churches power over others. Fear of Sorcery or black magic Witchcraft was also a dangerous hazard in those times, and far too many innocent women (usually it was women!!) were burned alive or drowned in a River or Ducking Pool for so called Heresy (teachings or ways of living not approved of by the church) or witchcraft (sorcery). Political Murders of Queens or Kings or Lords and lady\u2019s, and studied use of both the art of Poison and asassination were also far too common daily occurrences in Medieval Society. Ambition and rivalry between local Kingdoms and lords led to marriages between their daughters to form a stronger alliance against others. Some lady\u2019s were murdered so the Lord could take a fresh bride who had more land power or money ,no one was \u201csafe\u201d\u2026  Being a poor lonely widow living on the edge of the village could often be a dangerous thing. You are always open to being victim to fake stories and lies, usually motivated by jealous persons who have something against you or you refused to sell your late husbands house or lands to !! Vengeful and greedy people used to take advantage of this kind of situation, so as to make a false accusation of \u201cWitchcraft\u201d against someone they did not like, to get the Church and the magistrate to Burn them\u2026.And then they took their land for themselves\u2026. Death from Black BUBONIC Plague The Plague That Shook Medieval Europe. The unsanitary conditions in medieval Europe allowed the disease to move rapidly northward. London, Vienna, Florence, and Avignon (the papal city at the time) were particularly hard hit. In Florence alone, 100,000 died within four months. In some cities, 90 percent of the population was wiped out. It was spread by Black Rats whose fleas carried and spread the disease to humans.  Insanitary dirty bad conditions were everywhere the \u201cNormal\u201d and it was a ticking time bomb for killer disease. Also all hoses were usualy made from a mixture of wood, hay and mud or Dung (wattle and Daube) and were in cities all Very close together; Fires swept through them with rapidity and easeiness. \u201cBRING OUT YOUR DEAD, BRING OUT YOUR DEAD\u201d The \u201cDead Cart\u201d makes its daily, sometimes twice a day rounds in a European city, to remove and bury in a big pit, all of the dead from Plague that spread in Europe.  HALF the ENTIRE human population of Europe was wiped out in the Plague or \u201cBlack Pest\u201d. THERE WAS NO CURE available, so the disease took its \u201ccourse\u201d\u2026..Some people caught Plague yet survived, but most did not. The origin of the English Nursery Rhyme \u201cRing a Ring O Roses, a Pocket full of posies A tissue a tissue we all fall down\u201d describes the rapidity of death by plague; people quite literally \u201csneezed\u201d and fell dead in the streets\u2026.  Above; (Image Carlton tv \u201cBrother Cadfael\u201d). Apothecary\u2019s Healers or medicine people used to prepare medicines\u2019 using Distilled herb\u2019s or plant extracts from leaves or flowers. But reliability and quality, effective medicine was very hard to come by. Medecine in the Middle Ages was primitive, and very bad with a few exceptions. Disease from dirt badly kept food, rats, mice, Faeces and dirty drinking water were also far too common, as was the accompanying practice of chucking all your dirty water (including the contents of last nights toilet) out from an upstairs window and down into the centre of the street. people had no understanding or comprehension about the connection directly between dirt and disease; Cooks did no wash hands, doctors went from the Morgue to \u201cmaternity\u201d without changing their clothes or washing, spreading disease even to mothers and their newly born young babies.

Also, today we tend to favour and measure intelligence of certain subjects over others. Maths, Science and technology often held up as the ultimate measure of intelligence, and we tend to think we are smarter than everyone who came before us because we have better technology and know more about science. I am extremely skeptical of such assumptions. Its chronological snobbery, to use C.S. Lewis phrase. I don\u2019t believe Medieval people were any less intelligent than modern people are. Before I get to my real answer, just some semantics. I don\u2019t favour the term \u2018Dark Ages\u2019 as its basically a derogatory term coined by modern writers, and Medieval covers a vast period of time. Just over 1000 years to be exact. So are we referring to Early Medieval c. 450\u20131066, High Medieval, c 1000\u20131300 or Late Medieval, c 1300\u20131500? I\u2019m going to talk about all of these. So, lets begin. We often consider universal literacy to be a mark of superior intelligence, or just the general superiority of the modern world. Yet I contest that universal literacy has actually resulted in the decline of certain skills, most notably, memorization. If everyone can get hold of a text, there is no need to commit any of that text to memory. The only people who really do that now are actors. Some people, on the other hand, had entire books committed to memory. Literally. There is a story about Alfred committed a book of poetry to memory, and Thomas Cromwell, the lawyer and servant of King Henry VIII of England, reportedly memorized the entire New Testament. They were by no means the only ones who could or did commit large amounts of text to memory. There were also poems. The Chansons de Geste were originally sung or recited. Epic poems like Beowulf were almost certainly recited orally long before they were written down. Oral tradition is also a great leveler: you can convey anything to anyone by means of oral recitation. It doesn\u2019t matter if they can read themselves or not. They don\u2019t have to if they can hear a story or poem, and learn it for themselves from the person they first heard it from. Things only really need to be written down if you need to record them in a concrete and unchanging form. Such as legal codes, histories, etc.  Then there was knowledge of the natural world. Medieval people and pre-modern people definitely had the edge on us in this regard. If you were to drop a modern person into the middle of a remote jungle, forest or other inhospitable environment, survival would be a challenge- to say the least. Unless they had some knowledge of what we would today call bushcraft- but Medieval people would probably have just considered to be common sense. We wouldn\u2019t know about which wild herbs or roots and plants were edible or poisonous, but the average Medieval peasant would certainly have done. They were probably a dab hand at lighting a fire from scratch, and making traps to catch small animals too. Ever hear people lamenting the death of old crafts and skills? Mass production of consumer and everyday goods has its benefits, but also its drawbacks. We tend to think people in the past were disadvantaged because they had to make her own clothes and household goods. Sure, we can just buy them to save time, but its often just time we\u2019re going to spend at work or at leisure. Medieval women may have had to spin their own wool, weave, cook and grow their own food, but they were self-sufficient. And the food would have been organic to boot. Someone else on here was actually quoting Blackadder and various fictional TV shows and movies as evidence of how miserable and superstitious Medieval people supposedly were. Honestly: just no. I\u2019ve written long posts on such diverse subjects as witchcraft and hygiene in Medieval Europe here. Joanna Arman's answer to Why was witchcraft so popular during the medieval times? Joanna Arman's answer to Was everything in Medieval England really as filthy as it always is portrayed as in movies like \"the King\"? Wouldn't this have been quite unhygienic, and smelly? So, I shall just put it briefly here. Medieval people were not stupid. They were not ignorant oiks with no sense of hygiene, nor were they going around in mortal terror of witches and damnation. There is a tendency to assume that religion was used as a means of control and oppression by the ruling classes. Not so, especially since Kings and clerics could be, and were, deposed and killed by their underlings. Honestly, that is a thoroughly modern interpretation, mostly popularized by 20th century Marxist writers. I don\u2019t want to veer off into the faith vs. reason discussion, except to say that Medieval people did not consider the two to be mutually exclusive. Being religious did not make them less intelligent, as far as I am concerned. And lets not forget that plenty of people today believe in such things as reincarnation, and various untried and untested \u2018alternative\u2019 medical practices. Are we really going to say that Medieval people were less intelligent because they believed a Saint could heal them, instead of say a crystal? Oh, yes but they didn\u2019t have modern medicine and everyone dropped dead at 30! Or did they? Well actually probably not, as its been demonstrated that historical life expectancy calculations are bought down considerably by high child mortality rates. There were plenty of Medieval people living into their 60s, or 70s, and even some beyond. And honestly, even as recently as the Victorian period, the life expectancy in some European cities was frighteningly low. We have antibiotics, sure and some better treatments, but not everything is ideal. Some cancer treatments for example. Also, some people are starting to reconsider and re-investigate historical remedies for certain ailments, especially herbal and natural remedies. Some have even been found to work. Medieval eye remedy 'kills MRSA' Nor it must be said, was Medieval Europe a void when it came to science, technology or learning. Medieval Europeans invented, among other things, mechanical clocks, spectacles, the hammer beam roof, the flying buttress, and quite probably the heavy plough, and the treadmill crane. Wind and tidal mills also seem to have been developed in Europe in the early Middle Ages from the rest of the world.  Roger Bacon made the first ever reference to the use of spectacles in the 13th century. The English Polymath is also said to have devised flying machines and submarines. And you probably thought it was Leonardo da Vinci who thought those up. Bacon was by turn as student of one Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, who some people credit with discovering refraction.  (More than Just a Bishop. Robert Grosseteste was a polymath, scholar, and the mentor of Roger Bacon) Ultimately though, as someone else has said on here, we should not judge a Medieval person for not knowing about astrophysics and black holes, when most of us don\u2019t know Latin or Greek, or the finer points of animal husbandry. They knew what they had to, and the learned used the scientific framework of their time- mostly based on the works of classical authors. Most of the inventions and innovations were dictated by practicality and efficiency. They didn\u2019t need to devise theories about exploring deep space, although this wasn\u2019t necessarily beyond their imagining, Really, I think that denigrating the people in the past might be a reflection of our own insecurities. Its an easy way to make us seem more intelligent, but not necessarily an honest one. ",
