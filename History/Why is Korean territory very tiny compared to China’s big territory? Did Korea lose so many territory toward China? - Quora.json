            "answer_text": "There is a summary at the very end of this post. First, let\u2019s be clear here that though Korea is indeed \u201ctiny\u201d compared to China, so are most countries in the world. With a land area of more than 216,000 sq. km. (84,600 sq. miles) the Korean Peninsula is larger than the island of Great Britain (203,000 sq. km.) and more than 65% larger than the Italian Peninsula (131,000 sq. km.). In terms of population, there are more than 72 million people living on the Korean Peninsula, compared to 83 million in Germany, 67 million in France, and 66 million in the United Kingdom, and 60 million in Italy. Put together, if the Korean Peninsula were a single country in the EU, it would be 9th largest by area and 2nd by population (below only Germany). So, when we\u2019re talking size here, let\u2019s not forget that Korea is not so much \u201ctiny\u201d as China is just incredibly massive. The answer to your question, then, has more to do with China\u2019s complex history of incorporating and governing wide expanses of territory rather than Korea\u2019s history of not doing so. That all said, there are some broad explanations for the size discrepancy. Chief among them is geography. Here is a relief map of China:  Now, here is a map showing the expansion of China\u2019s earliest dynasties:  If you compare the two maps, you can see that Chinese civilization originated in the basin of the Huang River (i.e. Yellow River), known as the \u201cNorth China Plain.\u201d Here, the Huang deposits silt carried from the mountains and deserts of the west, making the soil amazingly fertile. In fact, the Huang River basin is considered one of the most fertile places in the world, allowing for the mass production of millet and rice \u2014 one of the most soil intensive but most calorie-dense grains. In other words, the area can sustain massive populations, and with massive populations, comes civilization. However, there is one problem with the North China Plain: it\u2019s not defensible. Flat land is notoriously difficult to defend, especially against horseback raiders such as the Xiongnu \u2014 the ancient predecessors of the Mongols and Manchus. Thus, through conquest and being conquered by outsiders, Chinese civilization came to incorporate the surrounding mountains and hills as a means to defend the heartland. And, when even that wasn\u2019t enough, the Chinese embarked on massive construction projects such as the Great Wall. So, the reasons for why China expanded and grew to such monumental sizes is that A) the North China Plains sustained enormous populations, which allowed the development of complex society; B) the ancient Chinese needed to expand into the surrounding mountains to protect the heartland from outside invaders. Beyond those surrounding mountains, however, wasn\u2019t particularly attractive to the ancient Chinese. The Gobi Desert is\u2026well, a desert. The Tibetan Plateau is notoriously difficult to live in, let alone administer from thousands of miles away. The Manchurian Plains is mostly grassland: good for grazing animals, but not for intensive agriculture. The only region of major interest to the Chinese was the south: the Yangtze River Basin, the Pearl River Basin, and further down the Red River Basin in Vietnam. Thus, to sum everything up: Pre-industrial, agrarian societies were dependent on agriculture to both sustain themselves and serve as the foundation of their economy. As a result, river basins are prime real estate. China hit the historical jackpot in this sense, being founded on perhaps the most fertile basins in the entire world along the Huang. However, the region is flat and indefensible and as Chinese civilization grew in number and power, it became a target for foreign invasions. Therefore, the Chinese expanded for two major reasons: to incorporate more defensible lands such as the surrounding mountain ranges and to control other river basins such as the Yangtze, Pearl, and later Red Rivers. Korea Now, let\u2019s focus on Korea\u2019s perspective:  As you can from this topographic map of the Korean Peninsula, the region is rugged and mountainous throughout. In northern Korea, there is a cluster of mountains that extend along the eastern coast of the peninsula like a spine. This cluster is the Baekdu (Kr.), or Changbai (Ch.), Mountains. As a general rule, Korean mountains are rocky and forested, making them poor sites for settlement, let alone farming. Considering more than 70% of the peninsula are mountainous, you can see that the peninsula does not offer a whole lot of options for city-building. BUT, unlike the neighboring Manchurian areas, the Korean Peninsula has a web of river systems that coalesce into relatively fertile basins. Here\u2019s a map:  This map (correctly) lists out all the major rivers, but for the sake of this post, I want to highlight four river clusters: the Taedong (3), the Han (4,5,6,7), the Geum (8), and the Nakdong (9), because these are, historically, the most fertile basins. As in China, these rivers were crucial for the development of civilization in Korea because they provided pockets of relatively flat, fertile land suitable for large-scale agriculture. It is no accident, then, that the largest cities through Korea\u2019s history have been on these river systems. In fact, these river \u201cpockets\u201d were so important that they defined the balance of power in Korea during the Three Kingdoms Period:  ^Apex of Baekje\u2019s rule (c. 300s)  ^Apex of Goguryeo (c. 400s and early 500s)  ^Apex of Silla (late 600s) Notice, that each of the Three Kingdoms centered around one of the river clusters that I defined earlier: Goguryeo came from the Taedong, Baekje from the Geum, and Silla from the Nakdong. However, between three kingdoms there are four river clusters, that fourth being the largest and most important: the Han River. And, for better or worse, the Han River basin is located directly in the center of the Korean Peninsula, making it the center of constant fighting. Thus, there is a rule when studying the Three Kingdoms Period: whoever controlled the Han dominated the peninsula. First, it was Baekje, then Goguryeo, and then Silla. Regardless, you can see that rivers were of absolute importance in Korea. Fast forward five centuries and you see that Korea is united for the first time under the Goryeo Dynasty:  As you can see, Goryeo controlled all four of the river basins of the Korean Peninsula, meaning that it basically controlled all of the productive capacity of the region. So, though Goryeo is actually \u201csmaller\u201d than the later Joseon Dynasty and Korea today, it wasn\u2019t in practical terms. The remaining area to be incorporated into Korea was the northeast, but as you can see in the map above, the northeast is purely mountains: not worth the trouble. The only reason the Koreans ended up incorporating that land was actually similar to why the ancient Chinese expanded beyond China Proper: to incorporate the mountains to better defend the heartland. We can confirm this by looking at Goryeo and Joseon records, which details the fight against Jurchen tribes and the construction of fortresses and outposts, but little else. Put Everything Together So, we talked about the absolute importance of river basins and how both China and Korea expanded the way they did to both: (1) control these fertile areas around the rivers, and (2) annex the mountainous areas to defend against outside invaders. However, that still doesn\u2019t quite explain why the Koreans didn\u2019t expand out of the Korean Peninsula. But, if you think about it, the better question is: why would they? Remember how I said the Chinese didn\u2019t have much interest in Manchuria? Well, neither did the Koreans. So, even if the Koreans were to expand, they\u2019d only be getting more of the Baekdu Mountains and beyond that, just grassland. All that does is give you territory that was not worth the resources needed to administer them. The ONLY place of interest to the Koreans outside of their peninsula is the Liaodong Peninsula, in present-day Liaoning, China.  This smaller peninsula actually resembles Korea in terms of topography because it also has a spine extending from the Baekdu/Changbai Mountains. But, along the coast, the terrain gets relatively flat and fertile, allowing for some agricultural production. However, the Liaodong Peninsula is smack dab between China and Korea, making the source of constant conflict between the two. And, while the peninsula is mountainous, the rest of the Liaoning area is relatively flat, meaning that it is easily accessible from China. Meanwhile, the Korean Peninsula is isolated from the rest of the mainland by the Baekdu Mountains, hampering travel between it and the Liaodong Peninsula. Still, the Liaodong was valuable enough for the Koreans to have vied for it throughout its history. In fact, though Goryeo laid claim to all of former Goguryeo\u2019s territory (see Goguryeo map above), it was the Liaodong Peninsula that was of prime concern to Goryeo. And (most people don\u2019t know this), after the collapse of the Yuan Dynasty, Goryeo actually briefly occupied the Liaodong Peninsula before being overrun by Chinese Red Turban rebels. After repelling the following Red Turban attack into Korea proper, Goryeo sent General Yi Seonggye to restore its control over the Liaodong, but by then, the Red Turbans had completely reorganized under the new Ming Dynasty, which appeared to be the new dominant power of China. Thus, Yi decided to instead turn around and seize control over the kingdom, eventually establishing the Joseon Dynasty as an ally of the new Ming order. Under Joseon, claims over the Liaodong were kept relatively quiet until the collapse of its Ming allies and the subsequent rise of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Given Joseon had no affinity toward the Manchus, who they considered barbarians, King Hyojong planned an invasion against them in hopes of reconquering the Liaodong once and for all. But, just like Goryeo before, by the time Hyojong\u2019s army was ready, the Qing Dynasty had completely supplanted the Ming and incorporated the Chinese forces under its banner. Thus, an invasion against a fully organized China would likely be in vain and was called off. TL;DR Overall, the story of China and Korea\u2019s expansion can best be explained by geography, along the lines of two main objectives: (1) to control agriculturally productive but indefensible land (river basins and plains), and (2) to protect it by controlling defensible but unproductive land (mountains, hills, etc.). The Chinese heartland is much larger than the Korean Peninsula and there were many other river basins nearby to the south, which is why China came to control a vast area. Meanwhile, the Korean Peninsula featured several fertile river basins, but the surrounding area was not of much value. Thus, once all of the productive \u201cpockets\u201d in the peninsula had been consolidated under a single Korean state, there was no incentive for Korea to expand. The only exception for this is that Liaodong Peninsula, which had some economic value and therefore was the center of attention for both China and Korea. P.S. \u201cWhat about Goguryeo?\u201d I got a question about Goguryeo (see map above) as an example of an ancient Korean kingdom expanding beyond the peninsula. And, by extension, Balhae also controlled the northern part of Korea and much of Manchuria. Why are these exceptions to my argument about geography? The answer is that they\u2019re not. Goguryeo was established somewhere near Mount Baekdu, along the Yalu River. Here, the river does not provide much due to the rocky terrain, so the early Goguryeo people (who were migrants from the ancient Koreanic state of Buyeo in the north) could not sustain themselves just from working their land. They were forced to raid neighboring states, including the Chinese Lelang Commandary occupying the Taedong River basin. Eventually, Goguryeo centralized into a full-fledged kingdom in the 300s, while China splintered into two competing dynasties, leaving their Chinese outposts to fend for themselves. Vying for the fertile Taedong basin, Goguryeo conquered the Lelang Commandary and immediately moved its capital there. From there, Goguryeo gained strength and began expanding south into the Han River basin and north into the Liaodong Peninsula and Manchuria. It met fierce resistance in the south from Baekje and Silla, but to the north, Goguryeo faced little opposition. In the 400s, Manchuria and northern China were divided, leaving very few strong enough to challenge the rising Goguryeo. So, why did Goguryeo expand whereas future Korean kingdoms didn\u2019t? Goguryeo was founded in a relatively inhospitable area and thus needed to raid and conquer to sustain itself. The importance of the river basins I mentioned earlier is still supported by the fact that Goguryeo moved its capital to the Taedong river as soon as it conquered Lelang. By contrast, later Korean kingdoms (i.e. Goryeo and Joseon) already had access to fertile areas in the peninsula and had no reason to expand far beyond their agricultural base. This same phenomenon with Goguryeo also happened again and again by different peoples residing in the mountains of southern Manchuria and northeastern Korea. For example, the Jurchen clans, who lived in roughly the same area as Goguryeo, constantly raided each other and neighboring Korea and China. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is Korean territory very tiny compared to China\u2019s big territory? Did Korea lose so many territory toward China? I have no choice but to tell you the history of China before I can answer your request. Half of China's history is not China' China was called out by many countries, and the Han Chinese regime collapsed. It has become the land of other countries many times. However, Korea has only changed the name of its country. Joseon has the same ancestors as the countries around Lake Baikal, including Xinjiang Uygur. Also, it has the same ancestry as many ethnic groups living in Mongolia and Manchuria. For this reason, even when China was ruled by another country, Korea was not disbanded because it was a country of the same ancestry. For example, when China was disbanded due to the invasion of gold, won, and Qing, Korea was able to remain the same even when China was ruled by many countries. However, we must consider the problems of the Qing Dynasty, which were just before the present China. During the Qing Dynasty, the name of Korea was Joseon. Because the people of Joseon and the Manchurians have the same ancestral roots... The land of Joseon was up to Manchuria.  However, as Korea was invaded by Japan, Japan used a policy of weakening the power of China and Korea. Cut off Manchuria, the land of Korea... A part of China's land was incorporated into Manchuria to establish the puppet government of Japan called Manchuria. Then, Japan claimed that Korea, the victim, was a war criminal. So Japan is not divided like Germany. Rather, it is unfair that Korea has been deprived of Manchuria's party between the Soviet Union and the U.S. power struggle and is now divided between the two Koreas. Previously, China recognized this history,  1933, Koreans in Manchuria, Paris: Agence Korea. The emergence of a new Chinese leader tore through China's history. He claims that the history of other countries other than China is his own. They even claim that Korea, which had been ruled by no other country but Japan for 5,000 years, belongs to China. There is a reason for making such an argument. I'm afraid they'll ask me to release Manchuria, their own country, in the future. Korea has created an element of dispute in advance, saying that Korea is part of China. It's like similar to the Dokdo problem in Korea. Originally, Daemado Island, which is the Japanese occupation, was the land of Joseon and was taxed by the king of Joseon. However, when Japan occupied Korea, it cut off Manchuria and forcibly incorporated Tsushima Island into Japanese territory. Then I burned down all the maps and history books of Korea... Even the king's tomb was robbed and Korean people played pranks on history. Even after World War II, he tried not to take it away, saying that it belonged to Korea but to Japan. So in order for Korea to be distracted... Book burning and clearly listed on the map of Japan and Korea that Dokdo is their land in disputed territory to try to make. No matter how much we try to distort history, it is impossible to manipulate it. Many underground relics that are still undiscovered have corrected the fake history. This is why China has stopped excavating ancient tombs and other tombs in Manchuria and is blocking access to Korean historians. ",
