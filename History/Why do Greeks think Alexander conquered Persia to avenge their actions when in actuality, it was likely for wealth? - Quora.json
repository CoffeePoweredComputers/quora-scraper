            "answer_text": "Its not that simple. Persia was for the Greeks of 550\u2013350 BC a immense threat and danger to their civilisation. The persian empire was the first true empire and they had approximately 50 % of the global population. Regarding the global population, its the most populous empire of all known history. In modern terms, imagine if the USA had a population of 3,5 billion people and attacked your country. Secondly, the Persians attacked the Greeks and Minor Asia and then because Athens and Eretria helped the Greeks of Minor Asia, Persians attacked mainland Greece. The Persians conquered the northGreeks(Makedonians,Thebians ,Thessalians etc) and they burned even Athens in the Median wars. During this period , the Greeks fought for their survival . Finally, the Greeks could defend themselves, but the trauma against Persia was immense. The northgreeks(Makedonians etc) were approximately 30 years under persian rule. Persians had an incredible civilisation and the Greeks often empathised with Persians as people (as can be seen in the play \u201cPersians\u201d), but overall Persia was perceived by the Greeks like Nazi Germany was perceived by the British in the ww2. I do not imply that the Achamenid Empire had any similarity to Nazi Germany. Even until the age of Alexander, Persia was an indirect threat to Greeks, as persian gold influenced greek politics. The Spartans were supported by persian gold against Athens in the peloponnesian war, Thebans were supported by Persians. People saw that Persia was in decline but they could not know if Persia would not invade again. Now, Alexander did his campaigns mainly for glory and not for money or women. He was king of Makedon , the strongest greek power and also the strongest power overall of the Balkans. He had wealth and women. He had also glory, but he wanted more, much more glory. Also, have in mind that most of the campaign in the Balkans were done by his father. The makedonian army was also mostly organised by his father. You are Alexander, you have ambitions to do something that no one else have done. You have in your borders the strongest empire that the world has ever seen with immense armies and its this culture that is perceived as a demonic threat and danger by your people/culture. Even your father (Philip) planned to invade persian ruled minor asia before he died. Also have in mind that many Greeks lived in Minor Asia who wanted liberation and self-rule. In light of all this, Alexander invaded Persia. Firstly, for glory , secondly for revanche . Thirdly , because he had a cosmopolitic ideology. He wanted to punish the persian state, but overall he was not against persian culture , as some Greeks were. He wanted that greek , persian and othe cultures coexist. It was his vision. After those three reasons, there were probably also materialistic reasons for his campaign. I am not implying that here was not also a materialistic undertone, but it would be an extreme oversimplification if you think that he did this mainly because of materialistic reasons. He even continued to do wars and and campaigns after the defeat of Persia and the capture of gold of Persia. He marched to India,Punjab(Pentopotamia- five river region) and he wanted to march even further , but his army refused to continue, because of the continuous campaigns. Btw his army did not mutiny as some people say. You could not lead a greek makedonian army if the soldiers did not love you as leader. The soldiers loved Alexander , but they refused to continue. They did not mutiny. That being said, we as modern people should condemn every aggresive war and campaign, irrespective if this campaign was done by our group or other groups.But its wrong also to judge other times by ouw own moral criteria. Its wrong if we make Alexander (and every Alexander) to a Saint and its wrong if we demonize him. As a Greek, I disagree with every aggressive war, but I have a big respect and admiration for Alexanders urge for glory , for his military thinking and for his vision of a cosmopolitan world. In greek culture /folklore Alexander is still known as \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Great Alexander. ",

            "answer_text": "The Greeks always framed their war with Persia as a battle between Barbarism and Civilization, and how the honor of civilization meant that the barbarians had to be destroyed. Of course, this is not remotely true, but it\u2019s taken a grip on the European cultures. Alexander was an incredible figure-brave, brilliant, charismatic, audacious. Nobody wants to believe his talent was just for money, power, and ego. No one wants to believe that anyone who was so great was out for themselves. And to be fair, he wasn\u2019t entirely out for himself. He wanted to bring Greece and Persia together into a single culture, he wanted to enrich Greece, to end the wars between Greece and Persia, and between Greek city states. He wanted a single cosmopolitan world. Of course, we can\u2019t deny that it also was for money and glory, the two main reasons for war, but we also can\u2019t deny Alexander his ideology. Human beings are complex, after all, and portraying him either as a bloodthirsty barbarian or a pure of soul, romantic, purely idealistic hero is just oversimplifying things. ",
