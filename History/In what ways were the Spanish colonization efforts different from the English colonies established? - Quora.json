            "answer_text": "In 1519, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was sent by the governor of Cuba to explore the coast of what is now Mexico. Instead, on his own, Cort\u00e9s set out to conquer the land and took soldiers, weapons and horses with him as a military force. He first landed on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula where he found a Spanish soldier who had survived a shipwreck of a previous expedition. He had been taken in by the local Maya and learned their language. He decided to accompany Cort\u00e9s. Cort\u00e9s then stopped in what is now the state of Tabasco on the south shore of the Gulf of Mexico. There, as a peace offering, the native Maya chief gave him several women. One was named Malinche. She was a Mexica (aka Azteca), so she could speak both Nahuatl, the Mexica language, and Maya. Cort\u00e9s then sailed north along the west coast of the Gulf until he eventually landed on what is now the coast of the state of Veracruz on the western shore of the Gulf of Mexico. The people there, through Malinche and the Spanish soldier as translators, told Cort\u00e9s of a great empire in the mountains in the middle of the land. He immediately decided to set out to conquer them. He got other indigenous tribes to join him because they sought the overthrow of the Mexica (Azteca). He first was admitted to the Mexica capital, Tenochtitlan (the \u201cHistoric Center\u201d of today\u2019s Mexico City) by its ruler, Moctezuma, as a guest, but eventually, conflict between the two groups erupted and Cort\u00e9s and his men had to flee in June 1520. They returned in 1521, with thousands of indigenous allies, and conquered Tenochtitlan. They then established Spanish rule over all the area controlled by the Mexica and went on to conquer or force the submission of other peoples in what is now Mexico and Central America (there were over three hundred different groups with different languages). They then required the conversion of the people to Roman Catholicism and submission to Spanish laws, so they sought the incorporation of the indigenous into the Spanish social structure to serve as laborers. In contrast, the English who first came to what is now the U.S. were either seeking religious freedom from the English Chruch or were working people who came as indentured servants to pay for their voyage and to then obtain land of their own for farming. The goal was settlement, not conquest. They made treaties with the indigenous tribes they encountered to be granted land to settle on. However, as immigration increased, so did the pressure for land. So treaties were broken and indigenous land simply seized. When the indigenous opposed such settlements, wars broke out between them and the settlers. Only minor attempts were made to have the indigenous adopt European dress and customs and learn English. Over time, they were pushed further and further west. This continued into the 19th century and the last \u201cIndian Wars\u201d after the Civil War. The remaining Native Americans were then forced to live on reservations, apart from \u201cAmerican\u201d society. ",

            "answer_text": "The main difference is that the Spanish crown tended to take responsabilities towards the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas, as well as towards the slaves in its territories. Those people enjoyed civil rights and protection laws that varied among times and places, and the lack of gouvernamental control in such vaste lands hindered their effectiveness, which was far from complete. But the fact that the majority of indigenous people supported the king during the independence wars and that the black slaves of the USA fled when possible to the Spanish Florida might give you a hint of the differences between the two models of colonization.
