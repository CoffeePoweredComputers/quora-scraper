            "answer_text": "That's not a very accurately worded question. You see Brazil is a massive country. Its a melting pot of cultures and depending on what area of Brazil you are referring to will greatly change which spices are used. For example, in the northern part of Brazil, spefically in the northwest where the amazon is, there are over 100 different species of peppers that are harvested. Now, you go northeast and you are in to regions of heavy African influence, so strong chilis are used along with palm oil and coconut milk. Head south into Sao Paolo and the spice level is very tame. Lots of garlic and onions are used. And meat is essentially on everyone's table. Beef is a way of life down there and the spice they use on it is rock salt. That's it.. They pack on rock salt as it kisses the eucalyptus charcoal fire and as they turn the meat the salt slowly falls off and the remnants are left on the perfectly grilled pieces of delicious picanha. In the US picanha is what's called the cap steak, it's the very top of a top sirloin butt primal cut. This cut of beef is the most popular cut in Brazil and it's delicious.. Head even farther south and you'll hit Rio Grande do Sol, this area was heavily influenced by German immigrants after world war 2 and some areas feel like youre walking down the streets of some small villages in Germany. The architecture is very similar and as you might of guessed the food is heavily influenced as well. Mustard sauces, schnitzel, braised pork shins.. mmm mmm mmm.. ",
