            "answer_text": "We can place some numbers to how strong/fit a knight *had* to be. -Capable of wearing around 19\u201320kg of maille armour.-Capable of swinging a 1.1kg-1.3kg sword comfortably.-Capable of doing both for at least 10 minute bursts of frenetic activity. We can even make some additional notes to help mark the margins of normal \u201cstrength\u201d- it was considered exceptional/noteworthy that Harold Godwinson, when visiting Normandy prior to the Hastings campaign was capable of wearing his armour and carrying another armoured man on his back. So that was ABOVE typical measures of strength. William Marshal pulled himself out of his saddle in armour by climbing on to a low-hanging building during a tournament to escape captivity. This was NOT commented on as a particular feat of strength (more a feat of cunning) so we know this was EXPECTED/NORMAL. Knights of the Temple (Templars) had fasted significantly enough during the 12th century that they were said to be \u201cincapable of lifting themselves to their saddles in their armour\u201d and this was seen as a very troubling sign of how the trend of fasting was effecting the men- we know this is BELOW the typical standard of a knight\u2019s strength. So- strap around 20kg of excess weight to your body, find a fence or a pull-up bar, and lift yourself up.That is the \u201cstandard\u201d physical strength of a 12th-13th century Anglo-Norman knight according to the primary written sources.

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily strong (by raw physical prowess), but extremely strenuous (had excellent endurance) and had excellent stamina and muscle coordination. The suit of armour would weigh 18 to 25 kg, and it would be worn all day long when at combat zone. The knight would train with it, practice with it, excercize with it and sometimes even sleep in it. And yes, I am aware of Finnish re-enactors actually swimming in armour. I have seen a re-enactor making somersaults and cartwheels in full armour, and catching an unarmoured archer on the run. Johannes Lichtenauer states the best knight will become from a boy who is medium size in stature, has good muscle coordination, long arms and has the center of gravity near the navel. Compare to a modern athlete, especially one professing long distance running, swimming or other sports of stamina. Archers usually were strong and robust - they had to do physical prowess, while the performance of a knight was more of combination of stamina and muscle coordination. ",
