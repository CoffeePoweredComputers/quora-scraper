            "answer_text": "The name derringer has long stood as the ultimate concealable firearm. The original Philadelphia Deringer was introduced in 1852, by Henry Deringer. The term \"derringer\" has become an accepted misspelling applied to a number of weapons that predated the actual first derringer. The terms pocket pistol, vest pistol, muff pistol (for the ladies), and palm pistol were often used along with derringer among his competitors. As a class of weapons they were primarily \u201cbelly\u201d guns meant to intimidate or shoot across a card table. The word \u201caccurate\u201d was not in their lexicon! That does not mean that they were ineffective. Small calibers and short barrels do not a target gun make.  There were a slew of micro-pepperbox guns designed around the small rimfire cartridges. Civil War soldiers often carried early rimfire revolvers as personal pocket weapons. Their use or effectiveness was minimal but they provided some feeling of added protection. As soldiers came to realize that their government issued weapons were reliable, most small \u201cpersonal\u201d handguns became a nuisance to carry and were sent home or traded and sold off.  Third Model Colt \u2014 .41 Rimfire Following the Civil War, the little guns often served as traveler\u2019s companions on stagecoaches and trains. The homeowner and shopkeeper had one in the drawer for protection against itinerants and shoplifters. Despite the publicity given to the one- and two-shot Derringers, ladies of the evening and gamblers often preferred the compact little revolvers and pepperboxes.  1865 National Arms No. 2 \u2014 Rim fire .41. Only 12,000 of these were made by National Arms before the company was purchased Colt. This little Deringer was a likely choice for concealable self-defense in the last half of the 19th Century. Almost any size bullet might be fired in anger from the hundreds of private weapons carried in the Old West. Thousands of pistols, sometimes advertised as \"lifesavers,\" were carried in holsters, pockets and waistbands, but many were small rim-fire cartridge weapons of .22 and .32 caliber of little power that proved useless except as a last means of defense. Of course, a small gun is better than no gun when the need arises.  A Philadelphia Deringer like that used to kill Lincoln. Percussion cap and 44 cal. ball. More than 15,000 of these weapons were manufactured. These were almost always sold in matching pairs. A typical price was $15 to $25 for a pair, with silver-inlaid and engraved models selling at higher prices.  Remington Model 95 \u2014 Rimfire .41 Remington manufactured more than 150,000 over-under double-barreled derringers from 1866 until the end of their production in 1935. The gun was made only in .41 rimfire. Each barrel held one round, and a cam on the hammer alternated between top and bottom barrels. There were four models with several variations. The .41 Short bullet moved very slowly, at about 425 feet per second. The Remington Model 95 achieved such widespread popularity that it has completely overshadowed all other designs, becoming synonymous with the word \"Derringer\".  The 1859 C. Sharps .22 and .32 rimfire pepperboxes rotated the striker rather than the barrels. The cylinders slid forward as one piece to reload, but there was no spent case extractor.  The small tip-up barrel .22 pockt revolver patented by Smith and Wesson in 1854 was a pathetic defensive weapon, and it was followed by a slightly more energetic .32 caliber cousin. Yet most derringer models (one or two shots) remained more powerful. So-called boot guns were somewhat more accurate, and served the same purpose.  The Allen and Thurber 10 inch was a dedicated target gun in 41 caliber, but it was often carried in the boot-top for self-defense.  The Merwin and Bray in 32 RF was another \u201cboot\u201d gun. The current production of derringers are used in Cowboy Action Shooting as well as a concealed-carry weapon.  The North American Arms 22LR / 22 Magnum modern derringer equivalent.

            "answer_text": "The small pistols, there were many kinds from pepperboxes, pocket revolvers, single shot, 2 shot over and under, and by 1900 semi-automatic .22, .25, and .32 caliber. Their purpose is to show a gun that would ideally encourage someone to stop, not start trouble, leave, put down their own weapon, give you their money and valuables, reconsider which gambler had actually won the pot, commit suicide easily, kill someone quite physically close by, or just be taken seriously after verbal abuse. So a nickle-plated small gun, quite shiny and visible, was preferred. Even shooting across the 30\u2033 of a card table at an adult male sitting steadily in a chair was unreliably fatal, often a quite trivial wound even from multiple bullets or a complete miss were the most likely result. It takes a lot of practice, a thousand plus rounds usually, to be an accurate shot with a very small pistol even across a room and the small bullets of those calibers requires much more precise placement. The muzzle flash, loud noise, sharp recoil from the very short barrels and light frame also means the shooter would often drop the gun after firing the first round or be quite disoriented, it\u2019s much easier to shoot a large pistol. Of course jamming the derringer or pocket pistol against the target\u2019s vital organs and firing from an inch or two away could work surprisingly well, but isn\u2019t of course aiming. ",
