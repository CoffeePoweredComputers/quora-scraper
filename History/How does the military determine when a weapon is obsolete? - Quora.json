            "answer_text": "Weapon is somewhat of vague concept in this question\u2026 It could mean a personal weapon like the M1911 pistol or the M14 rifle, then it could also refer to a larger weapon like the M114 155 mm howitzer but it can also refer to what would be more properly called a weapons platform\u2026 The first is STILL in military service even though the original design is over 100 years old (officially an antique)\u2026 The second was made obsolete due to a change in operational philosophy (carry more smaller and lighter cartridges)\u2026 And while the original 155 artillery pieces have all been worn out or otherwise scrapped they\u2019re not that different from what replaced them\u2026 What replaced them is really different kinds of munitions, propellant and targeting aids\u2026 As for weapons platforms, for example, the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, M1 Abrams and Fletcher-class destroyer you have to understand that even with the best of maintenance these platforms have a limited life span after which it becomes totally uneconomical to keep them in service (i.e. obsolete)\u2026 However, their lifespan is long enough that these platforms often go through several rounds of upgrades to new electronics, new weapons and so forth\u2026 Take for example the M1 Abrams, the versions currently in the field share, aside from the basic body, propulsion unit and gun, very little with the original version\u2026 Many improvements have been made\u2026 And on a platform such as this which is basically \u201cremanufactured\u201d every few years it will take a major technological or operational change to make them obsolete\u2026 However, try to do the same with say a naval unit and you get to a point where a new vessel will be cheaper then a \u201cremanufactured\u201d vessel\u2026 And it will incorporate all the new technologies (e.g. newer more reliable propulsion systems, newer more capable electronics, newer more capable weapons, new technologies like stealth)\u2026 As you know, progress can't be stopped\u2026 New technologies come on-line and so forth\u2026 An example of technological obsolesce is when ships went from coal fired steam power to oil powered steam power\u2026 In other words, obsolesce of military weapons is a matter of several factors\u2026 And most militaries will try to stretch their equipment as far as they will go and then some\u2026 Until economy, technology and battle effectiveness rule out further use\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Traditionally I would say that weapon systems become obsolete when the cost of maintaining them exceeds the cost of replacement. A good example would be field artillery. At some point breaking down a gun like the M198 155mm and refurbishing it simply costs nearly as much as a replacement like the M777.\u200b  \u200b\u200b\u200b (Out with the old, in with the new) \u200b  \u200b\u200b\u200b Weapons also can become obsolete when flaws or exploits that can not be addressed in a cost effective manner are identified. In the past we have discovered how to exploit Warsaw pact electronic warfare systems to make them display whatever we wanted them to. More recently the American BlackBerry (and cellphones in general) has turned into a security nightmare, and I suspect that the Russians can exploit them to tell us what they want them to.  \u200b\u200b\u200b A 3rd major indicator of obsolescence is when the state of the art has surpassed your systems by a particular amount. You can't really nail this down, but historically systems seem be to obsolete when newer systems are 30% more effective (needle to bolt action rifles) 50% (bolt to semi automatic) or even 100% (rifled muskets to needle rifles). A particular new form of obsolescence that seems unique to America has surfaced over the last 50 years where weapons become politically obsolete. Typically this seems to occur when a major political backer is removed from power or a major industrial lobbying assault occurs. For instance, the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate was commissioned in 1977 is is considered to be one of the best frigate designs in history. It was an inexpensive multipurpose ship that was easy to maintain, crew and packed a nasty punch for its size. In short it's the perfect ship for a nation with long coasts whose economy is dependent nautical commerce. The Perry was a rugged little ship that survives multiple missile hits, mines and gun fire. But in the end it could not survive a concerted attack by industry lobbyists who wanted it decommissioned to make way for \"progress\".  \u200b\u200b\u200bThe Perry class has been described by her crews as being \"a fugly looking tough son of a bitch\", \"ugle but she'll ruin your day\", the \"red headed bastard step child of the navy that punches above her weight\", \" A-sub, anti air, escort, she gets shit done\" and for the bean counting types who disaprove of cussing sailors. \"One of the most cost effective multi role platforms in American history\" Then we have  \u200b\u200b\u200bThe Independence class LCS which is as big as a WW2 destroyer but is outgunned by most corvettes.It has been described as \"sexy\" and \"expensive\" \"it will need a destroyer escort to survive in contested waters\" and my favorite which came from a merchant marine board \"these are the ships that are supposed to escort us and the navy now says they can't even escort themselves\" I know which one I'd want escorting me through hostile waters...
