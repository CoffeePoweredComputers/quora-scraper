            "answer_text": "Cavemen did not exist, in that nobody habitually lived in caves. Our ancestors were nomads, moving from place to place with the seasons. Usually, there\u2019d be no caves to live in, and when there were, people rarely went beyond sheltering in cave mouths. Deeper in, caves are dark, clammy, and possibly full of dangerous animals. Early humans traveled too much to be characterized by the kinds of places they lived. They weren\u2019t cavemen any more than they were \u201cforest canopy people\u201d or \u201cliving-out-in-the-open folk.\u201d Having said that: our prehistoric ancestors would have been in pretty good shape. Indeed, the same goes for most of our historical ancestors. Physical labor would have been a regular feature of every day, and indeed most of every day. Even basic tasks of getting and preparing food would require walking around a lot to find food, get water, dig roots, process things like nuts, plants with thick skins, and freshly killed animals, and so on. Known hunter-gatherers have quite good all-around conditioning. That said, their daily routine doesn\u2019t optimize them for strength. Endurance is just as important if not more so. Think of them more as triatheletes than body-builders. With the development of agricultural and later technologies, more specialization with tools means more development in specific areas of the body. It\u2019s well-known that Medieval bowmen can be distinguished by the marks of extreme muscle development around the arms and shoulders, but that kind of thing goes back well into the past as well. Grinding grain before the use of animal power meant a lot of tedious work with hand-held grindstones, so early farmers likewise developed disproportionately strong arms. In upper body strength, at least, they\u2019d likely be comparable to modern athletes. ",

            "answer_text": "Hard to say with confidence (and BTW, they weren\u2019t \u201ccave men\u201d). Neanderthal are built with stronger skeletons exhibiting highly developed muscle attachments on heavier bones. That indicates greater muscular development. The succeeding modern humans were physiologically very similar to us. But \u2026 they were probably not terrifically stronger than a modern farm or ranch hand used to heavy work. But \u2026 (again) they were undoubtedly much \u201cfitter.\u201d Their sole transportation was their feet. Their sole means of achieving speed was running. We don\u2019t really know a lot about that, except that a fit, well conditioned human can run farther, longer than any other mammal. That means, by the way, that while no human will be an impressive sprinter compared to most mammals, we are the fastest at long distance. We seem to be evolved to travel long distances very efficiently and rapidly. ",
