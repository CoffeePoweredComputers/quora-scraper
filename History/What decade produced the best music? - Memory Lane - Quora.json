            "answer_text": "What makes anyone think they can give a definitive answer to a question that can only be answered subjectively? Most of us, in the US anyway, begin to absorb the popular music that will influence us for the rest of our lives, by the time we are around twelve years old and that window stays open until we are maybe thirty or so. By the time the window closes we tend to think \u201coh, they\u2019ve ruined popular music\u201d, or something more negative yet. What has happened, here in the land of commerce, is that no one is designing popular music to sell to thirty something listeners, but only for early and late teens and you just noticed that you are no longer in that category. My musical tastes were formed first at home and in school, with classical music and a now somewhat pallid repertoire of watered down folk songs and Broadway show tunes. There was a folk music revival going on as I was coming of age in the early sixties and I found myself drawn to it as other kids were wallowing in rhythm n\u2019 blues or or the sanitized white pop stolen from black artists as well as some of the material that had been synthesized into the products of producer/writer teams at the Brill Building in New York, such as Ellie Greenwich, Phil Spector and Carol King, Gerry Goffin. It wasn\u2019t until I had digested the history of American folk music in a a very simple way that I came to understand and appreciate the diversity of our music from the early days to the time of my youth in the sixties that I realized that we all have this experience. My parents generation were complaining about how horrible rock and roll was and confused as to why my generation, initially at least, would not embrace Glenn Miller or Frank Sinatra, but those sounds were as foreign to most American teenagers (other than hearing their parents listen to it) as if it came from half way around the globe in another language. My window closed in the seventies for the most part (there are always exceptions) and I was unwilling to take Disco music seriously or after that new wave, punk or rap and hip hop. I realized that there was far too much recorded music already available to be explored that I did not need the new forms that were being put out in public. If I listen to popular music from the sixties and seventies, I hear a mixture of charm and mediocrity over all, no different than any other era, it\u2019s just that it is in a form specific to the generation that it was substantially aimed at. Despite my detachment and indifference to much of popular culture and it\u2019s strident commercialism, the farther away the era in question becomes the better it seems to look. Although a great deal of crap was produced in the fifties and sixties, my breath is taken away when I see old films showing Chuck Berry or the early Beatles presenting their particular art forms. Even some of the silly stuff still comes off as fun and refreshing today like Sam The Sham and Pharaohs singing Wooly Bully, for instance. Personally I think it is a grave mistake to think that any era was superior, it is all a continuum leading only in one forward direction, more and more a synthesis of the varieties of the past, which is what the pop music (and the country music and the jazz, etc) of the sixties was doing, just as is every other generation before or after.

Great music was so diversified in the 70\u2019s. Most of my all time favor music came out of that decade (my first 10 yrs on earth). You could be rockin out so hard to Ted Nugents \u201cStranglehold\u201d one minute and the next be crying in your beer over Jim Croces hauntingly beautiful \u201cTime in a bottle.\u201d Or spittin dope rhymes with Blondies \u201cRapture\u201d or screaming along until you lose your voice with Janis Joplin\u2019s \u201cAnother little piece of my heart.\u201d Or maybe disco was your scene and you just wanted to \u201cKeep dancing the night away\u201d with The Bee Gees. Or maybe you lived on the wrong side of the tracks and liked to slam dance, spit on people and jump around with The Romones and The Sex Pistols. The 70s were a decade full of dark and weary times but its music inspired some of the absolute best music ever. The Eagles, Queen, ELO, Elton John, Carol Carpenter, Grand Master Flash, Lynard Skynard, Fleetwood Mac James Taylor, The Comadores, Captain & Tennile, Tom Petty, Chicago, Blue Oyster Cult\u2026. The list goes on and on. Classics. Music that still stands the test of time. ",
