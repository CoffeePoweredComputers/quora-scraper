            "answer_text": "Why does any garment go out of fashion? As you say it was due to people wishing to move away from the old fashions. Other fashions of the time died at the same time for example huge bouffant hairdos for fashionable ladies, and buckled shoes. Other things changed too. The 1700s were regarded as a disreputable era by the late Georgians, despised as a time when sexual morals were lax. The early 1800s saw a rise in Christian worship and church attendance which continued into the Victorian era. In fact \u2018immorality\u2019 did not go away , it just went underground. The tricorne hat actually survived in a modified \u2018bicorn\u2019 style for British Royal Navy Officers into the 1800s. Lord Nelson is wearing one on top of his column in Trafalgar Square. ",
