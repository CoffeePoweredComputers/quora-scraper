            "answer_text": "No, white people didn't exist until around the sixteenth century or so. Certainly, there were people with lighter or darker skin than others, different textures of hair, eye color, and so on, but the categorization of people as white as opposed to some other color-based racial category wasn't invented until quite late. (There is evidence of \"black\" as a sort of racial category much earlier, but it wasn't opposed to \"white\".)  Now, were there people in Italy and Greece that we'd categorize as white? Sure. Probably a lot of them. But even now, our racial categories aren't particularly well-defined. I remember when the identities of the guys who bombed the Boston Marathon came up. Since their families were from the Caucusus Mountains, they literally could not have been more Caucasian, and yet there were people who categorized them as \"not white\" on the grounds that they were sort of Middle Eastern instead. So while someone today might think of many Italians and Greeks as \"white\" as opposed to, say, \"black\" or \"Asian,\" they were doubtless not nearly as white as, say, most people in Germany and Scandinavia. With that in mind, one might be tempted to categorize them less as white and more in the way one categorizes people from the Middle East, or something like that. So the whiteness of the Greeks and Romans depends in part on what the observer thinks is white. Finally, the Greeks and Romans were not racially homogenous any more than, say, people in the modern US. Africa and the Levant are, after all, a relatively short trip across the Mediterranean from Greece and Italy, and they were all in contact with one another for centuries before the Classical period and the rise of the Roman empire. Indeed, the Roman Empire occupied large chunks of North Africa, which made a lot of Africans Romans as well. So some Greeks and some Romans would have been, to us, as unambiguously black as others might be unambigously white. ",

            "answer_text": " Case closed! Actually, I think the other answers have covered the definitional side of the question quite well. Just to toss in a few extra data points: According to Homer, Achilles and Menelaos (Helen of Troy's husband) were both described as \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, xanthos, which used to be routinely translated as \"blonde\". That translation has been deprecated as having Aryanist overtones -- but it's the color Aristotle describes as 'between red and green' and it's used for, among other things, corn, lions and fire: it might not by Nazi approved bottle blonde but it's yellow hair. In Hesiod, Ariadne and Demeter are also xanthes. Apollo, meanwhile, is \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2, chrysocosmes, 'golden haired' (thankfully nobody bothers to try and explain that one away). Eros -- better known to us as Cupid, in his Latin incarnation -- is another \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2. Hesiod -- who actually does seem to have had a thing about blondes -- also uses it for Dionysos even though there is a counter-tradition in other Dionysus stories that the Wine God came from Ethiopia. Helen of Troy herself, Odysseus' wife Penelope, and Athena are \u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u1ff6\u03c0\u03b9\u03c2, glaucopis, 'light eyed'. The glauc- is the same root as in our glaucoma (a Greek medical term originally) . A lot of work has gone into trying to \"prove\" this does not mean \"blue-eyed,\" but it definitely means 'light eyed' and by Plato's time it described as the color you get when you mix white and sea-blue.* Meanwhile Hera and Persephone (along with a few mortal women) are \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03ce\u03bb\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, leukolenos \u2014 \u201cwhite-armed.\u201d And, also from the Iliad, there\u2019s Ajax (Iliad, 11.573): Single-handed he stood midway between the Trojans and Achaeans: the spears that sped from their hands stuck some of them in his mighty shield, while many, though thirsting for his blood, fell to the ground ere they could reach him to the wounding of his fair flesh. where fair is \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, leukos, from the same root as Hera\u2019s white arms. It\u2019s also the word for the color of snow or an old person\u2019s hair. Moving out of myth into history it's a surprisingly hard to find detailed descriptions that will satisfy the modern racialist: we forget that we've lost a lot of the colored statues and paintings which the Greeks and Romans loved and that they felt no need to comment on things they could see all around them. Here's Plutarch on Alexander illustrating exactly the problem: The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modeled. 2 For those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate, namely, the poise of the neck, which was bent slightly to the left, and the melting glance of his eyes, this artist has accurately observed. 3 Apelles, however, in painting him as wielder of the thunder-bolt, did not reproduce his complexion, but made it too dark and swarthy. Whereas he was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face. The original Greek that\u2019s translated here as \u201cfair\u201d is leukos again. According to Aelian: They affirm likewise that Alexander Son of Philip was of a neglectful beauty: For his hair curled naturally, and was yellow; yet they say there was something stern in his countenance. That was xanthos again if you're keeping score..  Some of Alexander's Macedonian chums, from a mosaic at Pella; 4th c. BC. As for the Romans? Luckily they were rather more interested in individual appearance than the Greeks, and even more luckily we have the garrulous tabloid journalist Suetonius' to give us details along with spicy tales of murder, incest and debauchery. Here's emperor Augustus: He had clear, bright eyes, in which he liked to have it thought that there was a kind of divine power, and it greatly pleased him, whenever he looked keenly at anyone, if he let his face fall as if before the radiance of the sun; but in his old age he could not see very well with his left eye. His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclining to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature (although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches in height), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him. And that paragon of Aryan virtues, Nero: He was about the average height, his body marked with spots and malodorous, his hair light blond, his features regular rather than attractive, his eyes blue and somewhat weak, his neck over thick, his belly prominent, and his legs very slender. His health was good, for though indulging in every kind of riotous excess, he was ill but three times in all during the fourteen years of his reign, and even then not enough to give up wine or any of his usual habits. He was utterly shameless in the care of his person and in his dress, always having his hair arranged in tiers of curls, and during the trip to Greece also letting it grow long and hang down behind; and he often appeared in public in a dining-robe, with a handkerchief bound about his neck, ungirt and unshod. If for some reason you find these unconvincing you might also note that common Roman nicknames (cognomina) included Ahenobarbus (\"Redbeard\"), Canus (\"Whitey\"), Flavus (\"Blondie\"), Rufus (\"Ginger\") and Albus (\"Pale\").  4th century AD mosaic from the Villa Romana del Casale. Amazingly modern outfits. One of the funnier side-shows of the whole racial comedy is the fact that we've gone from obscurantists complaining that Homer committed 'an injustice' by depicting Hector as 'dark haired' because the Trojans were clearly members of the same 'race' as the Greeks... to obscurantists complaining that only a Nazi would think that xanthos Menelaos, glaukopis Athene, and flavus Augustus were \"white\". This is, alas, a subject which drives people mad. If you didn't already know that, start googling around and you'll see just how mad, from the folks who think Socrates was black to ones who have lovingly combed the annals of Rome cherrypicking every fair-haired emperor -- even freaking Nero** -- as proof of Aryan Right To Rule. That way lies madness. \u2014- * More discussion if you really care here: Kiwi Hellenist ** If you're still counting, btw, it isn't clear from Suetonius if Caligula's \"golden beard\" was his own or was a literal beard made of gold, for occasions when he dressed up as Jupiter. Caligula also imposed the death penalty on anyone who mentioned goats in his presence. I think he had a thing with beards. ",
