            "answer_text": "The failure of Operation Barbarossa plus Typhoon. Even if the Germans were able to cause nightmarish losses to the Red Army, it was still not enough to cause the Soviet Union to crumble and thus crushing Hitler\u2019s quick victory objective. This prompt the beginning of a war where economic factors were of the utmost importance and Germany was not prepared for that and in fact, that was the reason to seek victory ASAP. Not to mention that Germany losses in the mentioned operations, although still low when compared with Soviet ones, caused severe manpower problems and the decision in 1942 for a single main operation towards the Caucasus oil fields (plus capture as many POWs as possible), starting with other crushing victories but ending up in the Stalingrad disaster due to the already mentioned manpower shortages and more effective Soviet resistance. Supposing the collapse of Stalin\u2019s regime, the other Allied nations would have faced major problems in fighting the now freed up Ostheer forces that would have probably focused on the Middle East oil fields.

It was the battle to convince a country already demonstrating it\u2019s willingness to engage in wholesale suicide attacks , to capitulate . I believe there were enough Military leaders and Cabinet officials willing to sacrifice every man , woman and child to oppose an enemy invasion . They coined a lovely phrase in Japanese that translate to \u201c Crushed Jewels\u201d . This faction was prepared to take down their whole society to fulfill the Bushid Warrior Code . Death before Dishonor . Had this faction won , they were dooming millions of their own people to a horrifying death . Yes , the Americans estimated 500,000 casualties , just n the Allied side . I am sorry to say it took TWO Atom Bombs to sway the militants . This was the most Important Battle . ",
