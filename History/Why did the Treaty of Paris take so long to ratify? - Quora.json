            "answer_text": "There are actually 32 agreements called the Treaty of Paris. I suspect you mean the 1783 one ending the American War of Independence: that took time because the document had to be shipped back and forth across the Atlantic by sailing ship in mid-winter. Most earlier treaties had just involved European powers, so communications had always been much simpler. ",
