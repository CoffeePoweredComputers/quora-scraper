            "answer_text": "It was highly effective as long as it had an experienced crew and wasn\u2019t broken down. The Sturmtiger performed the best when it could sit stationary and pick off targets a good distance away due to the limited gun transverse. Anything close required the tank to turn to face it, which placed considerable strain on the drivetrain due to it\u2019s excessive weight. An experienced crew could do that without tearing things up while poorly trained crews could ruin the transmission on their first attempt. I\u2019m pretty sure that the smart crews would back up while turning then move forward and the rookies would try pivoting in place which brought instant disaster. 20% of Sturmtigers were combat losses with 80% destroyed or abandoned by their crews due to breakdowns.
