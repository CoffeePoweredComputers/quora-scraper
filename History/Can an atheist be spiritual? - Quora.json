            "answer_text": "That really depends on what your definition of atheism is. In a conventional sense, no, because atheism is usually defined as a rejection of anything beyond the physical realm, a belief largely based on an ontological thesis called Physicalism. However, in a broad sense, perhaps it is possible. If you are a practical atheist, and you simply reject the idea of a deity due to the lack of reason or motivation express interest in theism or because you simply cannot be bothered with the idea of God or gods, you may still have a chance at being spiritual if you subscribe to some other ideas that are spiritual but not theistic. Examples: (1) You do not believe in God but you believe there is a force of good in all people that enables us to do good things or become better. That\u2019s still a form of spirituality. (2) You reject the idea of God but you believe the Earth is one living thing and each inhabitant is a vital organ. (3) You can\u2019t be bothered to believe in God but you feel the need to make yourself better. You become selfless and devote your life to finding ways to make life better for everyone, acknowledging that we are all of the same substance and we are, therefore, essentially one. Perhaps \u201catheist\u201d, because of the conventional notion of what it\u2019s \u201csupposed to mean,\u201d is a very restrictive term. \u201cNon-theist\u201d would be more appropriate. In fact, there are even non-theistic religions. To name some: (1) Buddhism in its original and ancient form. Gautama Buddha taught that perfection can be achieved through the middle way, purifying one\u2019s self through meditation, service and living on Earth through the noble eight-fold path\u2014one lifetime after another and another and another. He did not talk about God. (2) Yogic Hinduism. Patanjali, the author of the Yoga Sutras, taught that Samadhi or \u201cconcentrative union\u201d is the ultimate goal and it does not consider God\u2019s existence as either essential or necessary to achieving this. (3) Jainism. It holds that the universe and the matter and souls within it are eternal and uncreated, and there is no omnipotent creator God. (4) Non-theistic Quakerism. While not subscribing to the notions of God, non-theistic Quakers value the community in the Society of Friends and appreciate the good work they do and the peacefulness, calmness and serenity of the silence in Meeting for Worship.

            "answer_text": "That depends upon the definition of the word \u201cAtheism\u201d that one adheres to. If one attaches atheism directly to religion, takes the literal meaning that an atheist is a person without religion (or anti-religion) \u2014 then it is indeed possible for an atheist to be a spiritualist. Because this person does not need proof or evidence to make life decisions, apparently, just a gut feeling would suffice. But if the more common translation of the word is used, which means that an atheist is basically a rational, critical, sceptical thinker who does not take anything for granted but must have at least some proof to let something guide his/her mind and morals \u2014 then we would not see this person take up spirituality as a mantra. Simply because s/he has just as much proof of having a soul as much as lord Visnu\u2019s footprints. Spiritualism can be called a non-organized religion, a new idea that hasn\u2019t yet gotten to build its mint. People started with worshipping many gods, we call that polytheism now. Pagans and nature worshippers of old and many more obscure forgotten parties are examples of this. Then monotheism prevailed in the form of worshipping one true god; although we have a couple of them in the major league. Well, now comes the \u201czerotheism\u201d - in the age of digital isolation, worship yourself! Self-growth! Forget the world, you are the important thing! Help people only because it gives you spiritual currency in the bank! We call that \u2018karma\u2019 now. Note that it works upon the same basic principle of religion \u2014 make people afraid of something. In this case, backlash of karma. While an atheist makes moral decisions unafraid of anything, unless be it a very real gun pressing on his/her temple. This is why it would be hypocritical for a modern atheist to believe in soul but not believe in God. The simple reasoning goes that if God exists, Allah has to exist as well. And your soul. And the flying spaghetti monster. And oh yes ghosts and somebody illiterate can cure your bronchial arythmia by just looking at you. And my dad was queen Isabella. You can\u2019t not believe in one thing if you believe in another, because all of them have the same proof \u2014 a lot of shouting. The street is not one-way, though. The problem with Atheism is that it is highly vulnerable to being contaminated by simple rebellion. This is why we see the garden-variety homegrown atheists here and there, angry and spewing disrespect for systems that has been guiding humanity for thousands of years. They are, literally, all talk. And they are also one of the reason Atheism gathers so much negative feedback. Simply put, it is like this. You either believe, or you know. There is no middle ground. Atheism is not about what you believe in or not. Atheism is not about whether god exists or soul exists or not. It is a toggle-switch in your head: \u201cLogic: ON/OFF.\u201d Or proof, or rationality \u2014 pick your brand of word. Means all the same \u2014 do you \u2018believe\u2019 it or do you \u2018know\u2019 it? Atheism is transcendence. All of those were many wines of different brands \u2014 atheism is quitting. And the rehab if needed.  Atheism is going into the light. ",

            "answer_text": "First, let me get the definitions out of the way. Atheism is nothing more than a rejection of the belief that god (or gods) exists. It is not even a position against supernaturalism. It is not even a pro-science position. It is only a \u201cI do not believe gods exist\u201d position. As such, there may exist atheists who believe in ghosts, pseudo-scientific theories, mystic healing, and magic. There may also be atheists who are racist, ethnocentric, and politically conservative. Atheism does not stop people from being any of these things. It\u2019s only about not believing that gods exist. Now to define spirituality. No two people will define spirituality the same way. It can indeed be literally about spirits (ghosts and suchlike), or it can be about something more beyond words. When asked if they are spiritual, people nod in the affirmative. But when asked what they mean by it, they dissolve into ambiguity. I have heard people say, without using the word \u201cgod\u201d, that their spirituality is about \u201ca higher power\u201d or \u201csomething above us all\u201d or \u201cjust a feeling\u201d. Spirituality remains undefined, and because of that, it remains prevalent. Religion is easy to reject in modern times. But a lot of religious baggage sneaks into rational minds disguised as spirituality. Depending on how we define spirituality therefore, there may be atheists who can be defined as spiritual. But they probably won\u2019t define it as having anything to do with a higher power that exerts any influence on their lives. Their definitions will be more\u2026 how shall I put it\u2026 esoteric. There is a worldview known as Religious Naturalism that Carl Sagan might be described as having subscribed to[1]. It finds in the scientific understanding of the world something that resembles religious feeling. Some people feel it in shrines, temples, mosques, and churches. Some feel it when watching Cosmos. I am an atheist. And I have a definition of spirituality also. To me, spirituality means the search for meaning. So the simple act of opening the dictionary to look up a word is spiritual to me. To understand something is, to me, the highest possible calling of a human being. All religion and all spirituality stems from the human need to understand. In ages past, we explained the universe using stories. These stories were the best we could do, and to some extent, they hold meaning even today. They tell us about ways of being and methods of conduct. What has changed is that we have come to a greater understanding of not only the universe, but also the impulse that causes us to look for meaning. The human condition is defined, not by supernatural influences, but by our species\u2019 imaginative outlook. This is, at least to this atheist, kind of spiritual. Footnotes[1] Carl Sagan",

            "answer_text": "I would say so! I\u2019ve considered my world/faith view, spiritual for several years now, with no particular pinning to a specific religion or belief system. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve long contemplated, an enjoy doing so! I certainly couldn\u2019t call myself an atheist in that very wide sense, of course. \u2026but, what does it meant to be spiritual? Essentially, for me my spiritual life has meant living with constant awareness or consciousness over all aspects of myself; my mind, my emotions, my surrounds, relations, and so on. For me, spirituality could readily be changed with the term metaphysics. Standard physicals, as we know, investigates forces and physical impacts on reality. Metaphysics looks at those which aren\u2019t so tangible and measurable to us; love for example. Thus, by this definition, I could say that spiritualism is about interconnection; firstly between the aspects of oneself, then by extension of life, and the world around us. You could argue that an atheist, being someone who holds no active faith, may not put any focus into the these sorts of considerations over life; but, in keeping with our inter-connective virtue/nature, on this, we can understand that although a person may categorically identify as an atheist, life is not so categorical; rather categories - \u2018atheism\u2019 being one - are simply modes of group aspects of life. Therefore, two individuals could call themselves atheists, but have very different approaches to life - one even more \u2018aware\u2019 than the other, just as two religious individuals may have very differing ideas and life approaches. In a concluded answer to your questions, I\u2019d say yes, an atheist could be spiritual; perhaps not ideologically (but this is a simple matter of words; semantics, and what we call things) but in principle, I can\u2019t see a great deal which would completely disqualify a person with atheistic views practically living a spiritual life!

            "answer_text": "Yes indeed they can be.While some atheists may indeed be a little orthodox and rigid in denouncing all the aspects of religion , a class of atheists are those who have discovered their reasons on why they ought to be atheists ,just like the religious people discover a belief system .Atheists are a group of people who detest any form of organized religion but they need not be against the idea of spirituality . I would like to bring in the perspectives of the SPIRITUAL ATHEIST,a fairly emerging belief system which roots in the motive to have an individualistic worldview rather than a dogmatic and institutional one ( as happens in the case of believing in a religion ) At first the phrase ' spiritual atheist' may sound contradictory and meaningless,which is mostly due to the failure to understand the constructs of religion and spirituality separately. While religion attempts to give meaning and binds us in a culture or dogmatic setup,spirituality is merely the process of searching for the sacred .It is essential to understand that what we define as sacred may not necessarily be God,it can be anything that enables us to attain a state of mind that we desire. Hence an individual who is spiritual need not be religious. If I am to sum it up in one statement,I would say: if spirituality is a human condition to ask existential questions then religion is merely one of the many ways in finding the answer. But as you can see,a spiritual atheist recognizes the legitimacy of religion and god as means to the same goal,we are not at all biased or hold any rigid views against religion. ",

            "answer_text": "So many excellent answers here already; it\u2019s strange that reading through these inspired me to add something, but that\u2019s the feeling I have right now. The notion that atheists share any characteristics other than their atheism is disconcerting for me. The simplest, only thing that atheists share is that they do not believe in a god or gods. That\u2019s it. Atheists don\u2019t espouse doctrine, they don\u2019t (in most cases), even care if others believe in their gods. Certainly, there are some that attempt to elevate their position as atheists into some sort of authority about religion not being valid without the existence of god or gods but for the most part, it\u2019s a personal observation of the fact that there is no god, are no gods. I don\u2019t believe in a god or gods. I do, however, have a great deal of faith. Faith in myself, in others. Faith, for me, is not defined by the fact there is no god or gods. My faith is that we can be good, moral people that work together toward good ends. Not in every case, and not in every situation, but in general I can and have relied upon the good nature of people in any place I\u2019ve traveled. I do not do so in a naive way, but my faith has carried me when I needed to find meaning in a situation. Religion is nothing more than an attempt to co-opt or annex the need for meaning that each of us has within. While many religious texts and the prophets of these same religions say that you don\u2019t need to be in a structure or have any organization at all to access \u2018god\u2019 through prayer and devotion, the religious structures themselves demand attendance, tithe, and other things that go counter to their own doctrine. Their prophets speak words of peace, yet their doctrine preaches nothing but hate and violence. I read several answers that atheists cannot believe in souls if they don\u2019t believe in a god or gods, but the two things are entirely unrelated. Whether or not I have a soul is irrelevant to me; if there is something after this physical life, some part of me that will exist beyond my time as a conscious being here and now, then I will learn this when I can experience it. Not before, not because of convenient excuses about how in each life here we forget our knowledge of another life outside of here. Only when this existence ends will I know, and that\u2019s easy for me to accept. This links me to the point of this question, which is whether or not I can be spiritual as an atheist. The shortest answer is: \u201cYes, I can be spiritual and an atheist.\u201d The longer answer is always more useful. Spirituality, to me, is an openness to the world; an acceptance of the myriad possibility of our world. One of these myriad possibilities is that there is more than one world, that somehow there are things beyond my experience or that I might experience if I push myself toward them. But that is not all that spirituality is; it\u2019s an openness to the sublime. I possess the ability to be openly affected by the things of beauty as well as the things of horror that we encounter in life. The word \u2018spirituality\u2019 is ill-defined for a good set of answers to a question like this. I defined mine above, your mileage may vary (and I expect it will) because each of us is on a separate journey. Inherent within us all, though, is seeking meaning in the world. We can find it within us, within the world around us, within a dogmatic structure that tells us what that meaning is, or any combination within or without these things I\u2019ve listed. edited: for clarity and typos.

            "answer_text": "Atheist don\u2019t have true spirituality. Spirituality is a bit like a intelligent universal energy which can give truth and inspire, peace, assurance, love and connection to the natural world and elements including animals. But spirituality works on faith, the one thing atheism by definition is against. For it is a connection of the human spirit (will) with the universal spirit (energy/God). So it has to work the exact opposite way as how the atheist operates. The atheist will not believe before they have the proof or the spiritual connection, but the spiritual connection having a will of its own has no reason to want to connect to someone who has not already committed their will to the connection (through faith). So such a connection wont happen. To get the spirituality you have to want a connection beyond the physical. Physical evidence is obviously physical, so when you like the atheist look for physical evidence you make the spiritual connection impossible, because the spiritual is not physical. You have to look for spiritual evidence to find it, and that can only be done with faith, since you can not see the spiritual or feel it. In the same way as with energy. Energy was found on faith. Yes energy has always existed and so has the spiritual, but we were first aware of it and able to measure it when someone had the faith or will to want to find it despite lacking evidence. Tesla and Edison for example did not invent the light bulb by going out and getting evidence of a light bulb which did not exist. They had to act on faith and hope that it might exist and investigate the idea without evidence, and after having done so they got the evidence and now light bulb\u2019s and energy is a fact just like spirituality is to all who has investigated it sincerely on faith. Spirituality is a power like energy, but stronger and faster and more sensitive. I do not know all it can do, it likely has no limitation since it is similar to energy which can not be created or destroyed and is everywhere. But I know it is a greater power, you may call it a super-power though not in a \u201csuper-hero\u201d way, extraordinary things can be done with it, but as a collaboration since it is a two-way communication. I am quite sure it can not be dictated for any time I have tried to I have lost it. ",

            "answer_text": "No, atheists cannot be spiritual. IMO, spirituality is a way of thinking about Nature in terms of human or human-like agents. That is, trying to understand how Nature works, not in terms of universal, immutable rules (e.g. Laws of Physics) but in terms of mental states similar to our own (e.g. intentions, desires, goals\u2026). Another way to bring out the difference between these two ways of thinking is the following - a Materialist believes that matter is fundamental while mind is emergent from it while a Spiritualist believes exactly the opposite. That is why there is a fundamental disconnect between these two camps on the question of origins - there is no mind (or external agent/creator/designer) that figures in the theories of Big Bang, Evolution, Abiogenesis etc. How did humans come to believe that the universe is somehow controlled by a human-like agent and that it has a purpose which somehow revolves around humans? It happened because the human species evolved as the most social among mammals. Consequently, our minds are optimized for social cognition and not mechanical cognition. By default we tend to attribute mental states to understand anything, whether people or animals, machines, rocks, rivers or trees rather than trying to analyze their behaviour in terms of mechanistic rules. So Atheism should logically extend to having a materialistic understanding of the universe as opposed to spiritual. And that is why there is a certain contradiction in calling yourself a spiritual Atheist. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but only if your IQ is above 50. Just to be clear, I should say that to me being spiritual involves a deep exploration, an attempt to derive a fuller appreciation of consciousness, the universe, and our place in it. There are lots of people who fall into this category, and I suspect their numbers have grown since Trump took office. IMO, two types of Religious people cover most of those who \u201cparticipate\u201d in organized religions (i.e., those at least a century old, maybe including Mormons on back): People who aren\u2019t really intellectually equipped to deeply contemplate the divine, and need something prepackaged to hold onto and feel secure.People who are busy enough with the rest of their lives, and appreciate the structure that going to a church/synagogue/mosque/etc. provides for their family. They aren\u2019t very religious, but they still \u201cparticipate.\u201dThere are those who are religious, but spiritual as well. They realize religion is ultimately a metaphor, an approximation of what actually exists, and are comfortable with that. This does not mean they don\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d but only that they realize that there is truth in other religions as well. It is just a guess, but I don\u2019t see this third class as being in the majority. I personally often feel closer to this third class people than to non-spiritual atheists, so long as they have enough sense to realize they don\u2019t have all the answers. It hasn\u2019t been possible for me to join any organized religion because it will involve people feeling it is their business to start telling me how to live my life, or what charitable organizations to contribute to. This third class of people are very close to spiritual atheists. One might even say they are the same. They only difference is in where they spend their Sunday mornings. ",

            "answer_text": "Can an atheist be spiritual? The problem here is that the word spiritual is an empty signifier, a string of letters/sounds with variable meaning, depending on the person using it.The meaning of Spiritual as an adjective to describe a person might range from \u201cNot materialist\u201d to \u201cA scented-candle wacko who believes in supernatural forces and use the word energy to name things that are not energy\u201d. Atheists, as long as it doesn\u2019t involve the belief of a god, are free to be whatever they want.Of course, the closer to the supernatural and the mumbo jumbo the less likely an atheist would be that definition of spiritual, but, generally speaking, atheists can: be non-materialist personsfeel awe at the beauty of Nature.believe that human beings and/or other creatures are part of a larger system of organizationmeditate and perform techniques to apease the psyche and bring balance to the mind/body dychotomy.feel love and feel they have the duty to spread lovedo whatever they want, as long as it doesn\u2019t involve the belief in a god.Speaking now from my personal perspective, I generally dislike the persons that call themselves spiritual, since I feel that they are snobs, with a desire to be \u201csuperior\u201d to their interlocutors.I\u2019d rather be a person who is not materialistic, who feels awe at the beauty of nature, who is just a tiny part of a larger system of organization, who is relatively open to some kinds of meditating techniques, who is an humanist, who is, sometimes, an optimist and who have some kind of life ethics/philosophy that owes a lot to Taoism. Which is not being spiritual but being Saurio. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. There is no dogma associated with being an atheist and no flock you have to stick with. You should feel comfortable to explore, pick and choose the lessons from several religions which appeal to you and leave out the elements of them which do not appeal to you. There's an old Sanskrit proverb: \"Let noble thoughts come to you from all directions.\" One doesn't need to believe in the resurrection of Christ to understand the value of sacrifice, nor does one need to believe Mohammed was the prophet of God to understand that if the mountain does not come to Mohammed, he will go to the mountain. Religious texts contain a lot of wisdom in addition to anything else you might disagree with. They also usually have a 'theory of everything' that helps one understand the immense complexity of the whole universe. Some would argue, so does science! Introspective folks have codified their knowledge of human social psychology in the holy books of various faiths, and more recently neuroscientists have begun to crack into what makes the seat of our consciousness tick. I apologize if you already know about these things, but the natural world around us is filled with examples of the amazing interconnectivity between all things, things that add magic to every moment in life, here are a few examples:Human beings aren't as separate as we think: Mirror neuronOur brain and our bodies aren't as separate as we think: Central pattern generatorLanguages aren't as separate as we think: Dialect continuumSubjects aren't as separate as we think: see the relation of the above and Ring speciesCultures aren't as separate as we think: Transmission of the ClassicsHumans and animals aren't as separate as we think:  Life is magical enough without additional magical thinking. There's plenty of spirit in the natural world. There's another Sanskrit proverb which is very touching \"As there are many rivers which empty into the ocean, the are many paths to enlightenment.\" By just asking this question on quora, you've already set out with your boat and paddle.

            "answer_text": "There is no common ground amongst atheists except disbelief in gods. Personally, I am not spiritual, though I'm unsure what the term means. So I guess maybe I am. I can't definitively say I'm not something that I don't understand.  I've noticed that when I say I'm not a spiritual person, some people -- even some atheists -- get really turned off.  After long conversations, we tend to clarify terms well enough that I realize they think of \"spiritual\" as a synonym for \"having emotional depth.\" So when I say I'm not spiritual, they think I'm saying I'm incapable of love, can't enjoy a sunset, feel no awe when I stand on a cliff overlooking the ocean, realizing how small I am, and am completely unaffected by music like this:  Nothing could be further from the truth, but I find \"spiritual\" an odd and confusing word to label the concept of \"having deep feelings.\" If you want to use the word that way then, yes, according to that definition, I am spiritual. However, I don't believe in spirits (supernatural beings), I don't believe in \"energy\" in any sense other than the way a scientist would use the word, I don't believe in reincarnation, I don't believe in souls, I don't believe in a separation of mind and matter, I don't believe \"everything happens for a reason,\" I don't believe in Karma, and, though I love love, I don't believe it conquers all. However, if I started believing in any or all of those things tomorrow, I would still be an atheist. I will remain an atheist, as long as I don't believe in God or gods. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings! I feel a lot of people mistaken the word spiritual to be germane to worshipping or praying to the Gods. They could not be more wrong about this notion. Being spiritual is all about being peaceful, honest, and devoting yourself to the purpose of spreading joys and smiles which may include praying to Gods as well. Spirituality is about making this world a better home for humanity, and to make your body a better home for yourself. And, I every day I strive to do that to the best of my capacity, and that makes me spiritual. Here is how!  Being spiritual is about being grateful. Being grateful for the lovely parents you got who buttress you in you in all your needs and decisions. Being grateful for you got to meet that special someone. Being grateful for you finally got the funding to launch your entrepreneurial venture. Being grateful for everything good in your life! Then being thankful is another aspect of being spiritual. If you like this post, thank me. That would make me feel gratified, and I would thank you for having invested time into reading and embracing my post. I thank my parents for they brought me up so perfectly despite all the ups and downs and financial turmoil they had to deal with. I thank my teachers and professors who inculcated that mindset of thinking big into me. In fact, I always thank the security guards, the carpenter, the plumber or the electrician and the postman uncle who come to your rescue every now and then. That again me being spiritual. Then there is another aspect. Being eager to help the ones in need. The pregnant lady needs help to pick up her bag? I rush towards her! A couple on a bike crashed on the road? I immediately call the ambulance and help them get the first aid ASAP! The bus conductor is sweating in the hustling crowd on the bus? I offer him some water out of my bottle. I hope you got my point. And, the most important aspect- I forgive others. I extrude out the hatred or grudges. Else, they would rust the iron in me. That won't benefit me at all, but would definitely vitiate my prospects. So, someone abused me? I let it go. The poor waiter dropped the tea over me? I let it go. My animosity towards him could cost him his job which feeds his poor family. If someone told me I am a pathetic writer with disgraceful thoughts? I promise I would forgive them and then again let it go. And, that's all about the me being Spiritual- Which means to make this world a better place by being a global citizen.  There is much more to spirituality that just belief in the existence of a supreme God. Regards, Shilanjan ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, as long as you keep faith out of it. I recommend the book Waking Up by Sam Harris about this very subject. In his usage of the term, the best usage, IMO, \u201cspirituality\u201d refers to some recognition that life is hard, and that the mind tends to race and wander in a way that makes life even harder. At some point one must figure out how to relax, as it were, and to realize that the best life is not simply the gratification of wants nor the repetitions of pleasure. Harris has quite a background in Buddhist traditions \u2014 I don\u2019t know what all \u2014 he gets sort of technical and in-depth about that, but I tend to gloss over that. His biggest point is that you don\u2019t need any sectarian nor denominational loyalties nor for that matter faith at all to take this journey. If you read just a little of the book, I recommend the first chapter and the beautiful Conclusion at the very end. He writes towards the end: Spirituality remains the great hole in secularism, humanism, rationalism, atheism, and all other defensive postures that reasonable men and women strike in the presence of unreasonable faith. People on both sides of this divide imagine that visionary experience has no place within the context of a science -- apart from the corridors of a mental hospital. Until we can talk about spirituality in rational terms -- acknowledging the validity of self-transcendence -- our world will remain shattered by dogmatism. This book has been my attempt to being such a conversation. ",

            "answer_text": "Although (as usual) I admire User's answer, I'd suggest that the definition of \"spiritual\" has morphed, beginning with the so-called, \"New Age\" phenomena, into something less defined and of course thereby more amorphous. Having lived in and traveled often to California, I cannot even begin to recount the number of times I've heard someone say, \"I'm not religious, but I am spiritual.\" Then they try to sell me healing crystals (just kidding.) As close as I've been able to come to discerning a definition which encompasses countless vagaries, I've concluded that, for very many, \"spiritual\" essentially means \"connectedness,\" to some Higher Power, the Earth itself, and the Labrador Retriever telling them to grow sativa and not indica (marijuana strains.) Backing up to, \"connectedness,\" I would suggest that this can encompass a wordless and compassionate relationship (entirely without resorting to any form of actual, direct communication) to all of humankind, or of recognizing that we - and everything else - are, a priori, manifestations of the same universe. By that definition, yes, an atheist can most certainly be spiritual. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Spirituality refers to \u201cmetaphysical experience\u201d, and metaphysics regresses to a purely mathematical identity, whose initial and terminal (self-dual) restriction is syntactically selecting its equality with the bit-free field. This identity injectively mapped the entire bit-free field into its own domain, converting it into an informational infinity of discrete binary ranges [0, 1]. These base binary ranges supply the identity with unlimited computational resources, with the only boundary being the bit-free field itself. Indeed, when the identity self-injected the infinite field, it binarized an infinite set into a self-loop graph [0, 1] with a vertex of 0 and and edge of 1. If you wish to visualize the bit-free field, the easiest technique is to picture a singleton graph \u2022 with exactly one vertex of 0 (denoting zero information). The problem is when one infers that the next graphical phase is the 2-path graph or line \u2022\u2014\u2022. This graph initiates a containment paradox whereby a line cannot contain its next state, initiating a constructive rupture of potential states and a relapse into the free field. Conversely, the self-loop graph is a self-duality between the 0-vertex and the 1-edge. Given that the nullary field is encircled by a unary edge, the graph is completely self-contained. All possible states are suspended in and available to the initial self-loop. Since this initial self-looping containment, the self-dual loop identity has perfected its configurative control over this free field, and hence, possesses global parallel distributivity over all interior communications among local operators. In effect, this identity is irreversibly eternal\u2026exactly because it\u2019s innate base-state scales to a unit-sphere in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. In short, GOD is the global-operator-desriptor and distinguished identity of a metaphysical manifold hosting human agents whom frequently report intricate details of \u201cdirect encounters\u201d with this manifold. These encounters are so perceptually intensive, temporally ramified, and emotionally explosive that humans uniformly call them spiritual, or if you prefer, ontological. These amazing and inspiring instances are viscerally seizing interactions with the higher-order finer attributes of the eternal entity, GOD, possessing an infinite-dimensional space. Atheism is a flagrant and painfully simple contradiction with the invariant logical structure of global reality\u2026exactly and only the realm where the \u201catheist\u201d is bodily and cognitively supported. Any agent purporting to negate the reality hosting it is either (a) deeply dreaming, (b) perceiving optical distortions and illusions strongly suggesting the instability of the environment; (c) conceiving logical distortions and \u201cdeducing\u201d philosophical delusions on various scales that seemingly entail that \u201cthere is no ultimate being,\u201d This entailment is invalid because the \u201catheist\u201d generating this logical expression is somehow unaware that its own expression is simultaneously negating the physical universe hosting its cognitive body. (d) The last conditions under which atheism is justifiable, yet nevertheless logically invalid, are the serious, sickening, and often devastating effects of anxiety, depression, personality disorders, abuse, and torture. The causes of these conditions are both physical and metaphysical. ",

Your inner peace , love , using your ability to attract what you want or not wanting anything at all . These things don't require a god . I have been into spirituality since I was 12 but I have never believed in a god . I believe that there is no power in the world greater than our own consciousness . I have related my spirituality to science completely . Psychology , neuroscience and physics have been my bases . Everything else usually builds upon them for me. For example I don't pray to any God . I pray to my own inner consciousness/universe etc . Because praying is a good mental practice (often in the LOA ). Just like a few of my witch acquaintances make spells . (In my opinion prayers and spells are not that different) ",

            "answer_text": "This is Mantralayam.  A small town in Andhra Pradesh which is home to the temple of a saint. The legend goes that the saint went into a state of deep meditative contemplation for the welfare of all humankind. My entire family, especially my mother believes in the higher power that exists here. I do not, however, once or twice a year I ride from Bangalore to this place covering around 400 kilometers. To start off with the ride is really great with some picturesque sceneries.  I go inside the premises and sit on my own watching everyone. It is amazing to see everyone so dedicated to a deity because they want their wishes fulfilled. There are people who roll horizontally along the floor around the deity, people who encircle the deity a thousand times and so on.  I buy a packet of prasadam[1] and immerse myself in everything that is going around. Over the years, I have come to realize that I find myself at the utmost peace during this time. Perhaps, because no one around carries any kind of negativity or perhaps there is so much harmony. I do not know exactly why but it feels serene. I have contemplated the human spirit umpteen number of times while being a silent gazer. There is a common line for everyone to see the deity and then there is a VIP line which of course, is paid, and gets you a faster visit. The prasadam is paid for as well. All that does not deter me until the priests there do not allow certain sections of the society inside the deity\u2019s premises. The saint went in for the welfare of mankind and yet not all sections of mankind are not allowed to see him. And that is when I realize that perhaps, I am better off soaking in the peace in the surrounding without any desire or wish in my heart to corrupt my faith in an entity. Yet, I will not demean or disrespect anyone\u2019s faith as I can see it clearly driving them even though in a skewed manner. As my prasadam gets over, I stand up, encircle the temple once for my mother, and leave the premises. I walk out a step closer to the spirit of humanity, and my inability to understand it, and yet brave enough to accept that being an atheist is better if my religion teaches me to different people because their ancestors were not part of an overly enlightened society. I felt the same at Ajmer Sharif Dargah, Haji Ali Dargah, Basilica of Bom Jesus as well. I do not know if it is spiritual or not, but I do know it is peaceful. Also, you should definitely try the prasadam at Mantralayam. Footnotes[1] Pras\u0101da - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "YES! Absolutely! I will try to help you understand by highlighting the differences in these two choices. And yes, these will be some bold statements, so read with a brave heart and open mind! Religion restricts you to a certain set of rules (often outdated, superstitious and very dogmatic) defined by people who died ages ago and probably aren\u2019t even born in that same religion today.Often, religions will set up fights between each other simply because their moral grounds are not the same. People are God-fearing, and there is barely any scope for mistakes. It\u2019s interesting to observe that religions are rapidly losing their credibility as science and \u2018logic\u2019 are beginning to rule the coming generations.On the other hand, spirituality rises above all the man-made notions of rights and wrongs. It let\u2019s you define your own path back to the Divine Source and makes you realize, God isn\u2019t to be feared, and there is unconditional love and forgiveness where we come from.Religion dumps everything on God and destiny when the bad times come, whereas Spirituality makes you a co-creator with the Universe, and lets you take control of your life. You stop having pity-parties.Religion tries to convert people\u2019s beliefs and is full of drama. Spirituality dissolves the falsehoods and helps one rise above the drama. Spiritual people will LAUGH when you disapprove of their ways because they know Spirituality is REAL and no argument can make you take it away from them or yourself, whereas religious people might even get offended (if you\u2019re really good at debating, you could even convince a person out of his religion, but you can never take a person out of spirituality).Religion separates the devotee and the devoted by claiming that God is far more supreme and we must bow down to someone we can never be, but spirituality sees no difference. Spirituality lets one become aware, that we are truly ONE! Because you are one with the Divine Source, you automatically act like the Divine Source and become a better person every single day.You can force someone to be religious by taking them to the Church/Mosque/Temple and making them bow their head down, but you won\u2019t EVER have to force someone to be spiritual. Once they\u2019ve joined the party, they\u2019re going to be here for eternity!You probably won\u2019t see very many \u2018problems\u2019 solved for religious people despite the numerous rules they abide and laws they don\u2019t break. Spirituality helps you get rid of the petty nuances, and instead drives you back to truth - you always have souls like Angels and Ascended Masters from the Spiritual Realm ready to help you with ALL your needs (financial, career, health, relationships) - which is why the more Spiritually Awakened someone becomes, the more blissful they\u2019ll become.There is no one God, and you are automatically driven to work on your healing, through whatever way deems fit to you (meditations, Reiki, crystals, working with Angels and Spirit guides, etc). Even if you\u2019re just sitting and sending good vibes to everyone you know, you\u2019ll know that you\u2019re helping heal our planet.Last, may I dare to say - religion is selfish, where you do everything to please God and have a better life. Spirituality is a transformation of self-love that becomes so powerful, you are automatically driven to serve others. You don\u2019t need favors anymore, but you simply love yourself, others and the Divine because that is your truest nature. You rise above materialism!Love & Light, V \ud83d\udc95 (About) ",

Spiritual is a pretty vague word, but as Sam Harris explains, there doesn't seem to be a good substitute. In Defense of \u201cSpiritual\u201d To me, spirituality is about the inner path of self discovery, not in an \u201ceat, love, pray\u201d way but in a perennial philosophy kind of way. Waking up from the outer socially constructed reality of Gods, standards and expectations is part of the journey. Waking up from the inner socially and mentally constructed reality is the harder completion. Unfortunately spirituality got coopted in the west by the political powers, obscuring the path greatly. Reinforcing the ego program provides tremendous control leverage. Western philosophy has been helping to break out of that to some extent, but the inner realms are usually explored in an intellectual way, without the practices that help lead to gnosis. Hopefully the growth in the west of mindfulness practices, neuroscience experimentation and direct teachers will help open up the way.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, when spiritual is defined as the realm of energy. The ancient esoteric teachings, distinguish \u201cspirit\u201d as \u201cenergy\u201d. The Life Energy that is animating all of us, and that leaves us at some point which we call death. That energy manifests for instance, as electricty and magnetism. Science has shown that our human nervous system runs on electricity. Acupuncture and traditional chinese medicine has shown the body has energy channels (spirit channels). Spirit, in the esoteric point of view is Energy, the original Source Energy that can be detected in all of life. This energy, as I mentioned is said to manifest in a variety of forms. So, by this defintion, every atheist is spiritual, a conductor of raw life energy, a user of raw life energy, a consumer of it and a giver of it. I think what atheists mean when they say spiritual, \u2026they are meaning in the context of a God or invisible governing entity that judges and decides the fate of humans based on religious ideas, or metaphysical ideas. But if we take spirit to mean energy, then yes, all atheists are spiritual, as are all human beings. -Rev. Siobhan ",

As an Agnostic I could imagine and even believe that something is there but not be certain about that belief. If an Atheist believes in something spiritual (other than a powerful subconscious) then they are probably by definition not Atheist but Agnostic or actually spiritualistic and just not believing in a god or christian god specifically.

And the more i study, the more, well, fascinating, reality becomes. As one understands more and more, the \"awesomeness\" of reality becomes more and more apparent, and one's \"spirit\" feels a yearning, a pull You can equate it with one of those Hollywood portrayed \"drug experiences\", when you love everything, and think its all so deep. When i experience moments such as these, i see them as deeply spiritual and humbling. ",

If that\u2019s you, whatever else you may be, then you\u2019re an atheist. After that, what you choose to think or believe is up to you. You can believe in ghosts, fairies, unicorns, aliens, animal spirits, poltergeists, vampires, witches etc. However, it does all depend on why you\u2019re an atheist: many of us are such because, rationally-speaking, there is no corroborating evidence for the theist claims that god(s) exist. The same is likely to apply to many concepts surrounding spiritualism and the supernatural. If you\u2019re an atheist on that basis, I would expect some considerable skepticism leveled at other concepts of similar nature. But, as always, what you choose to believe is up to you. None of us have the right to gainsay you in this. You however may only consider yourself an atheist if you do not believe in the existence of god(s). That\u2019s it. ",

The thing about atheism is that it allows me to see religious experiences as being spiritual without them actually having anything to do with the deity that the congregation is attempting to evoke (invoke?). It's an exchange of emotions between members of the congregation, an attempt to build that emotional outpouring into something that is greater than the individuals. Even if the actual deity involved doesn't exist, it's still spiritual. ",

However, religion and theism are not the same thing. It is definitely possible to be a spiritual atheist: Some Buddhists and Taoists are spiritual atheists, for Buddhism and Taoism are not necessarily concerned with deities. Most Confucianists are spiritual atheists as well. New Agers may also be spiritual but not theistic. Animists don\u2019t necessarily recognize deity in the sense of a powerful unseen being \u201cout there\u201d; rather, they see innate power in all of us, and that could be seen as compatible with atheism. Pantheists don\u2019t either; rather, they see deity everywhere, in everything, and\u2014from a certain point of view\u2014if everything is god, then nothing is God. None of these persons are concerned with worshiping a god; yet they do celebrate their spiritual life. Some atheists are actually agnostic, meaning that they may be open to the possibility of a god, but they renounce fundamentalist or dogmatic religion. (Most atheists heard critiquing \u201creligion\u201d are actually describing fundamentalism; but not all religion is fundamentalist.) Spirituality and atheism are not necessarily at odds; though fundamentalist religion and atheism are at odds. Fundamentalist religion is not the only spirituality. In fact, the argument could be made that fundamentalist religion is anti-spiritual, because it is opposed to first-hand inspiration and upliftment, in favor of stricture and dogma. Don\u2019t conflate fundamentalist religion with spirituality, or even religion. ",

The Latin \u201cspiritus\u201d meant \u201cbreath\u201d. That\u2019s where all this nonsense comes from. \u201cGod blew spirit into the clay and turned him into a man.\u201d Evidently blowing your breath into someone (which would have been understood by anyone who understood Latin in the first 2 centuries of its existence) is what makes him alive (according to the \u201cscience\u201d of the day). Today? As Alec said, it means whatever the person using the word means it to mean. So we have possibly as many as 7 billion contradictory definitions of the word, so it\u2019s useless to impart information (which is what any word is supposed to do - that\u2019s the purpose of language). \u201cSoul\u201d is another one like that. \u201cYou\u201d are your mind and what it thinks and how it responds. When you die, your brain, which is what generates your mind, dies. (Otherwise, even if you\u2019re in a PVS, a coma or a locked-in state, you\u2019re not dead.) When the \u201cyou\u201d of you dies, there\u2019s nothing \u201cliving on\u201d in some \u201cplace for the dead\u201d. It\u2019s like turning an LED off - it just stops producing light. It doesn\u2019t change color, or produce some light we can\u2019t see, it just stops. Like we do when we die. It\u2019s not for atheists, it\u2019s for linguaphiles, people who love and, hopefully (I know, that\u2019s not actually a word) understand language. Atheists just don\u2019t use words that religions make up for their own purposes, and both of those words, spirit and soul, are just that - words made up by Christianity. ",

            "answer_text": "I have to reiterate a common misunderstanding about a-theism and atheists. All they believe is the opposite to \u2018a belief in a God or Gods\u2019, that is, the opposite to theism. Whenever there is the letter a in front of a word you just take the negation of the word. If your programmer you know this because a-synchronous is the opposite to synchronous. Atheism in itself says nothing of spiritualism. Some atheists believe in spirits, some do not. There is not even a common agreed upon definition of what spirit means. So if any atheist did believe in spirits you would have to determine their definition first. We can all generally agree that we are sometimes in good spirits and sometimes not. We all have the capacity for the pursuit of the good, the true and the beautiful. To me this pursuit is spirituality. One doesn't need to be religious or atheist to be inspired (in spirit) by/to these pursuits. Sometimes religions and philosophies resonate with this inspiration, but sometimes they do not. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes people make up whatever they want, there have been all kinds of variations. Buddhists are technically atheists, but are spiritual. Stoicism was a philosophy that did not care about the many gods in polytheistic societies, but they saw humans as special beings. The modern atheism movement borrows from the philosophical ideas of scientists. These ideas were used for reducing argumentative noise. For example if you can't see something you assume it is not there, instead of assuming it is. Then when trying to understand how it works, you look only for what can be seen and measured. These are mental tricks that override the mind's tendency to make things up. These tricks worked quite well for science. Older generations believed in the four humors, or made up books about nature where animal behavior was used as an example of how to chase away satan. One memorable example was an animal that bit off its scrotum when it encountered a human hunter, so we humans should bite off our sins when we encounter satan. This is the kind of stuff early scientists had to deal with. The rigid system of experimentation, only caring about what can be seen threw away a lot of the old nonsense. Modern atheists believe this approach can be useful outside of science. This is merely a belief, the human mind and how it works in groups is not understood by science yet. ",

Self knowledge has nothing to do with God. It is obtained through Self-enquiry. Devotion can be of anything. You can be devoted to Life, a mountain, Ocean, your wife etc. Whatever you are devoted to, you become like that gradually. We use devotion to purify our Hearts. You do not necessarily need God for that. Duty can be done faithfully without believing in God. And finally, you don't have to believe in God in order to serve others. Through these four you will progress spiritually even if you are an atheist. There is no need to believe in God to be Spiritual. When you will know who you are without a shred of doubt, then you will see you are everything, you are God. If you have difficulty in any of these four steps, I would be happy to help. ",

Being spiritual does not necessarily mean being religious or believing in God. Meaning of Spiritual: of, relating to, or affecting the human spirit or soul as opposed to material or physical things For me, spirituality is finding that mental and inner peace and it comes to me through my morality. Again  morality is knowingly or unknowingly attached with being religious. But morality is your conscience and your humane side. So yes, I\u2019m an atheist and I am spiritual. ",

The word spirit does have another, non-supernatural meaning, however, and that is essence or authentic meaning as in \"the spirit of the law\" as contrasted to \"the letter of the law.\" Used in this sense, a person can be concerned with matters we might define as \"spiritual\" without meaning anything supernatural.  Broadly speaking, a person who is \"spiritual\" in this sense is concerned with the meaning of life, and is not satisfied with superficial answers to the question of life's meaning. I consider myself \"spiritual\" in this sense, and furthermore I consider atheism and skepticism an asset, not a liability, in the spiritual quest. This is because a person concerned with spiritual matters will be helped by having access to the truth, and hindered by having the wool pulled over her eyes. ",

Spiritualism is looking inward, introspecting deep inside than to look outside or search outside\u2026 religion takes you outside\u2026 to a temple, building, people, priests, saints while spiritualism takes you deep inside yourself. You meditate and introspect.. you may need some guidance in the beginning but then, it is all upto you to go higher n deeper in it. Spiritualism is all about being good, kind, stable emotionally, capable to control your urges, etc. it is not about donating money to a charity/temple/church but helping people who really need it. It is about showing perseverance and tolerance compared to aggression and rhetorics of a religion. It is more about aligning self with with the nature not destroying the nature around you. It is about being in Harmony instead of propagating your own, it is about setting oneself free while religion binds us more. There is no strict path to spiritualism compared to religion which is full of strict rituals. Yes, it is lot easier and smoother for an Atheist to be spiritual as one does not have the baggage of the theism and he may not need to undo a lot of damage done by being theist. ",

Indeed, With all due respect to Christians, I don\u2019t blame them.But Christians don\u2019t need my approval, do they? They have their faith and will find their peace in that. To many human beings, the precepts of Christianity present a limiting, self diminishing and wholly faith based platform that is in conflict with a big part of who they are, and what they love about themselves. They see it is a pronouncement of judgement, persecution born and sanctioned out of a declaration of \u2018sin\u2019, and disaffiliation on a deep level with anyone who\u2019s beliefs do not concur with that of the church. They will in fact seek to convince others their beliefs are wrong. This is an affront to one\u2019s own self dignity and inherent equality with all human beings. Christians do not see inherent equality. Nor do they understand that the respecting of their fellowman relies upon the unconditional acceptance of their right to perceive life as they desire. If you can wade through all of the dark stuff, there is available love and salvation, but not without a price. There is guilt. There is the reality of constantly being manipulated by the fear of damnation, and this is commanded apparently by the very god who teaches forgiveness. As well their is blatant denial of science and ignoring aspects of mind created and capable of exploration of the unknown to find answers about the mysteries of life. This understandably would turn away many an Atheist. Not everyone wants to get on board with an elaborate centuries old tale filled with bloody crusades, and persecution raging with anger, wrath, fire and brimstone. Some may not enjoy the prospect of ferreting out some positive message from scriptures filled with abominations and a jealous god, incest and commandments. But they don\u2019t have to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Human beings have tremendous potential. Atheists would do well to toss out the definition of god that has been pushed at them by religion, and open their minds to an \u2018intelligence\u2019 rather, that is merely a part of their inherent potential. This intelligence is detectable and experiential, and one that incorporates all faculties of thought. It is one that is directly tied into their own unique expression in the world. It is an intelligence that is not cluttered by ancient story lines, but frees up a person to embrace the present moment. YOU are the living tale told via the living of one\u2019s own life every day. They need not continue to deny what Christians teach, only let it all go and start fresh. Seeking to deny a definition and prove it wrong, is harder than throwing out the definition altogether and seeking to redefine \u201cIT.\u201d We are each equipped to set upon this exploration on our own and on our own terms. We need not be told what to do like little children. When the timing is right, the urge comes from within. There are no \u201cshoulds\u201d involved. Inherent intelligence works personally with each one of us. Eastern thought is a priceless method for this type of exploration. . It must use some of the same words, but the journey is wholly different. In this realm of thought, it is merely oneself that is being explored. One retains self authority and self dignity. One uses all faculties of mind. There is no middle man. Every journey is unique, and the positive aspects of it are not kept at arm\u2019s length, but experiential, and deeply, intimately available. One can use their own discernment throughout the discovery process and no one is going to judge them. One is their own walking, talking laboratory. Even Theoretical Quantum Physicists are getting on board with Eastern thought and the parallels in their new research of how energy works and what is taught in Eastern thought is stunning. So I think one can be an Atheist and seek god. Just let go of the word itself and call it what you want. What any human being is seeking in reality is not god at all. They are seeking their own inherent potential. That sounds like something that would be acceptable. Call it that. No harm, no foul. Or they can seek TRUTH, the mysteries beyond the obvious wherever they feel inspired. Its the act of seeking, not the memorizing of a story. That makes all of the difference in the world. You do not even have to know WHAT you\u2019re seeking, as what you seek, is seeking YOU. To seek is our nature. To deliberately not seek because of religion is being controlled by religion. ",

            "answer_text": "Being spiritual simply means that you don't accept that the physical reality that surrounds you is all there is. You believe there is some innate essence or force that animates living things and that may exist after our physical life is over.  This belief is frequently explained or put into context with the personalization of this force of life, creation or redemption in the form of a deity or deities. But this doesn't necessarily have to be so. For example, churches in the New Thought movement (like Religious Science, Unity or the Church of Divine Science) do not have the standard deities and instead believe in an \"infinite intelligence\" or life spirit.  You can be an atheist (not believe in God) and still have metaphysical beliefs that there is something more to life than the sensate world. ",

For that, it is necessary to understand that both science and religion have been talking about the same thing all this while. The religious books say:1. God is everywhere2. God created Everything3. God has the capability to do anythingIf you think about it, it is possible to say all of this scientifically as well. Here, I talk about ENERGY. Energy has been defined as:1. Matter is nothing but frozen Energy. (So technically, everything is made up of energy)2. The amount of Energy in this universe remains constant3. Energy cannot be created nor can it be destroyed.Look at the three principles above and the three principles below. You'll see similarities.So there you have it. Science or Religion. They all talk about God more or less in a similar way. ",

If you say that knowing the real meaning of life is spirituality, then I will say that real meaning of life lies in the science. The basic purpose of spirituality is to answer what is the meaning of life. I found the answer using science. In my opinion life existed on earth just by chance, and humans evolved by another accident which is by random genetic mutation. So the purpose of life is to pass on the gene to the next generation. But humans are somewhat more intelligent than many other living beings, so our purpose increases. Serve the animals and birds near you, help them live, and feed them, and help the human being near you. This is the purpose of life. I am atheist, so I don't do it because I want to go to heaven, I don't do this because I want another life. I do it for my own satisfaction. Because I know that there is no spirit, I know that there is no afterlife. I am made of atoms and after I die the atoms in my body returns to the nature. So I am not afraid of God or any other eternal fears. I just live my life with full potential until I die. Because there is only one life, no other life to live. I don't need spirituality or religion to answer any questions in my life. Science and humanity is enough to get any answers. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. Atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist. Atheists have also argued that people cannot know a God or prove the existence of a God. It favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Spirituality is the aspect of humanity that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant. Both are rejection of belief in any form of God or deity, any religion or practice. Atheism states scientific facts why God doesn't exist or why everything is explainable by science.Spirituality states that everything in the world is form of energy. Which is also science. Hence, disbelief of God and trusting scientific facts makes you an Atheist and in addition to this believing that there is energy everywhere makes you spiritual. So it's not necessary that an atheist is spiritual or a spiritual person is atheist, but it is possible for a person to be Both. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can be an atheist and a spiritual person at the same time. Buddha was an atheist and also a spiritual giant. Let me quote form a story on Buddha by Osho so that you will be able to understand clearly. Hope it helps. ;)  Osho : Once it happened, Buddha entered a village. A man asked him as he was entering the village, \"Does God exist?\" He said, \"No, absolutely no.\" In the afternoon another man came and he asked, \"Does God exist?\" And he said, \"Yes, absolutely yes.\"  In the evening a third man came and he asked, \"Does God exist?\" Buddha closed his eyes and remained utterly silent. The man also closed his eyes. Something transpired in that silence. After a few minutes the man touched Buddha's feet, bowed down, paid his respects and said, \"You are the first man who has answered my question.\"  Now, Buddha's attendant, Ananda, was very much puzzled: \"In the morning he said no, in the afternoon he said yes, in the evening he did not answer at all. What is the matter? What is really the truth?\"  So when Buddha was going to sleep, Ananda said, \"First you answer me; otherwise I will not be able to sleep. You have to be a little more compassionate towards me too. I have been with you the whole day. Those three people don't know about the other answers, but I have heard all the three answers. What about me? I am troubled.\"  Buddha said, \"I was not talking to you at all! You had not asked, I had not answered YOU. The first man who came was a theist, the second man who came was an atheist, the third man who came was an agnostic. My answer had nothing to do with God, my answer had something to do with the questioner. I was answering the questioner; it was absolutely unconcerned with God.  \"The person who believes in God, I will say no to him because I want him to drop his idea of God, I want him to be free of his idea of God -- which is borrowed. He has not experienced. If he had experienced he would not have asked me; there would have been no need.  \"The person who believed in God, he was trying to find confirmation for his belief from me. I was not going to say yes to him -- I am not going to confirm anybody's belief. I had to say no, I had to deny, just to destroy his belief, because all beliefs are barriers to knowing the truth. Theist or atheist, all beliefs, Hindu or Christian or Mohammedan, all beliefs are barriers. \"And the person with whom I remained silent was the right inquirer. He had no belief, hence there was no question of destroying anything. I kept silent. That was my message to him: Be silent and know. Don't ask, there is no need to ask. It is not a question which can be answered. It is not an inquiry but a quest, a thirst. Be silent and know.  I had answered him also; through my silence I gave him the message and he immediately followed it -- he also became silent. I closed my eyes, he closed his eyes; I looked in, he looked in, and then something transpired. That's why he was so much overwhelmed, he felt so much gratitude, for the simple reason that I did not give him any intellectual answer. He had not come for any intellectual answer; intellectual answers are available very cheap. He needed something existential -- he needed a taste. I gave him a taste.\" Source : from Osho Books ",

The spirit of course, is a reference to the broader category of the Supernatural or Metaphysical. Of course, when an atheist affirms the Supernatural or Metaphysical, they generate contradictions regarding the atheist denial of the existence of God, who is the ultimate Supernatural or Metaphysical Identity. This is why atheism is difficult to argue in the context of logic. Logic itself has to be abandoned to maintain an atheist position which affirms the Supernatural and Metaphysical. This is why most  enunciations of \u201catheism\u201d historically,  are  founded  upon  Monist  (materialist)  premises  which deny the existence of anything but natural phenomena  or what are referred to as matter, energy, space, and time.

I understand spirituality as the search for our \"true selves\". I think that spirituality boils down to the search for the answer to question \"Who are we really?\".  I like thinking about stuff like this post: Kevin Simler's post in Essays. I find the Hard problem of consciousness to be very interesting. I loved reading G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach because of what it makes us consider about our consciousness and intelligence. I found Advaita to be very though provoking when reading about it in this course. I am intrigued as to what the results of experiments such as this one mean (it seems to imply that our conscious self really makes no decisions, and is rather like a passive spectator). And so on. Of course a materialist would say that it is all nonsense and that consciousness is just a consequence of the way the brain works and has nothing mystical. I can't prove either notion but I am inclined to believe there's more to it than just that. But I guess I still qualify as atheist because I don't believe in gods that created the world, that must be worshipped and that tell you how to behave and judge you. ",

Atheism is not like Christianity where Christians are dictating terms as to what defines a Christian. If you have no belief in god, you are an atheist. That is it. There are no further conditions and terms upon which you have to agree as is the case in religions. Now, whether you can be spiritually minded and still an atheist, it is completely up to you. It depends on your own definition of spirituality. No one is going to dictate terms for you. If you define spirituality as the belief that there are souls and spirits roaming the earth, and atheism as the absence of belief in god, then, yes, you can be both if you believe these two notions.

Spiritual or spirituality really means connecting to the inner essence which is guiding me from inside and supporting my life. Here there is no concept of believing in something. We are experiencing this connection in our daily lives and interacting with this inner essence. We call it intelligence, wisdom, thoughts, feelings emotions, all these are expressions of this inner essence. If one explores deeper into this science of spirituality one can discover many things. In order to perceive this science of spirituality with clarity, meditation is being used as a tool to elevate our mind to a certain state. In this state of mind we are able to discover something more profound which normally can not be realized. Slowly we gain regulation over these subtle forces governing the life at many levels. These things can only be experienced individually; no amount of study of any kind of literature can give this experiential knowledge. With a sincere heart i would invite you to try and practice Heartfulness meditation (heartfulness.org). The sole purpose of this method of practice is to provide such experiential knowledge without any pre-notions, pre-understanding. Anyone from all backgrounds can take up this simple, effective practice and experience themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "No, and neither a theist. Spirituality has become a very controversial word now a days. It has different meaning for different people. As per my understanding of Spirituality. I would say neither a theist nor an atheist can be spritual. Both atheism or theism , as antonym as they sound, are actually in a way synonyms to each other. One is a positive assumption the other is negative. One is belief ,but the other is also a belief , a negative one. You need to understand it before we go further. Believing God exists, and believing God doesn't exists, Both are \u2018beliefs'. Your own idea of truth but not actually the truth. But Sprituality doesn't come when there is beliefs, assumptions & ideas. It's when you throw away every preoccupied ideas in your head, in dustbin. You start to search or seek. Those who search outward , we call them scientists. Those who seek inward we call them \u2018Yogi'. This inward seeking is as per my understanding is sprituality. ( I am no spritual guru though, my only qualification is I come from the land of seekers.) Hope this helps \ud83d\ude4f ",

You can still believe in spirits, souls and so on as long as you don\u2019t think the root cause of them would have to be some kind of deity. Practically, rarely. The most common approach to atheism is scepticism and rationality. Most atheists reject the claim of the existence of deities because there is no objective evidence for their existence. There isn\u2019t any objective evidence for the existence of spirits or souls either. Which means we would have to reject those, too. Most atheists will reject both gods and spirits but you can be atheist and spirtual at the same time. It\u2019s just not very common. ",

            "answer_text": "There is nothing in atheism that rejects self-reflection. Many atheists reject the supernatural, rather than the spiritual. If we take the supernatural out of the spiritual, then we are left with breath. This is not as banal as it may seem. Such a definition of spirit takes us back to the root concept: spiritus sancti = sacred breath. Breath seems to be the root of words like Prana and Qi. It is in a very real sense the thing which unites all people. We breathe the same air. And there is more to this than respiration. We have lots of conscious control over our breathing, and this is closely tied in with voice. We use voice to express emotion. When we sing and laugh, we are in high spirits. When we sigh or cry, we are in low spirits. To extend this idea, voice is our first means of expressing ideas. Language is a big part of our minds, and so - by implication - is voice. Anyone who attends lectures is literally listening to spirits. Any time we hold a conversation, we are communing with spirits. Breath may be common, but voice is important. Our breath also operates without our conscious control, and is of course vital to life. So breath is a big part of our bodies too. To study breath is therefore to study something that sits on the body/mind junction. It can be a path into our less-conscious minds. Paying close attention to how we breathe is very useful in self-reflection, since even small shifts in mood or tension can noticeably change respiration. Notice how you can hear strain in someone's voice? Concentrating on the breath has long been used as a way of calming the body and opening the mind. And is safer than nicotine! I submit that the essence of spiritual practice lies in self-reflection. Many atheists have turned away from religion due to the way some churches stifle* personal reflection in favor of official dogma. Dogma is rigid, spirit is dynamic. They can\u2019t co-exist, IMO.  * Literally, \u201cmake someone unable to breathe properly.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The over attachment to worldly bonds is the source of sin. Every human being exists in this stage of over attachment to world. Pravrutti is the reduction of this over attachment so that limited proper attachment to the worldly bonds is reached there by the balance of this society is achieved. Over attachment to worldly bonds is injustice and pravrutti is the justice. Nivrutti is total detachment from these worldly bonds so that total attachment to God results. The human being is inherently associated with the characteristic of attachment to either world or God. As the reduction of the attachment to the worldly bonds proceeds, simultaneously the attachment to God proceeds. If there is ten percent reduction in the attachment to worldly bonds, it means, there is ten percent attachment to God. Therefore, pravrutti does not oppose nivrutti. In fact, pravrutti is the middle stage between over attachment to world and over attachment to God. Without pravrutti, nivrutti is impossible. Pravrutti is aiming at nivrutti only. Jaimini Sutras deal with pravrutti and Brahma Sutras deal with nivrutti. Ramanuja explained the meaning of the word Atha, which is the first word of the first Brahma Sutra, like this: you must start nivrutti after pravrutti only. Without reaching pravrutti, the middle stage, nivrutti, the final stage cannot be reached. This is logically correct. Shankara told that if the human being has already reached nivrutti in the previous birth, in this birth it can straightly start from nivrutti without going back to pravrutti again. Hence, there is no contradiction between Ramanuja and Shankara in the context of the meaning of the first word of the first Brahma Sutra. Basis of nivrutti is the acceptance of existence of God. If the existence of God itself is not accepted, pravrutti becomes meaningless and unstable. http://www.universal-spirituality.org Social justice cannot be maintained if the existence of God is not accepted. If God does not exist, what is the use of reducing the over attachment to this world? If you say that the over attachment to worldly bonds leads to sin and injustice, which in turn disturb the balance of society, nobody understands the overall effect of it. In such case, everybody wants that all other human beings should follow pravrutti to maintain the balance of the society and individually commits sins. This becomes the famous story that everybody should pour a cup of milk in the empty tank kept by the king so that everybody can pour a cup of water, which cannot be detected. Everybody wants the social justice and balance of society, but at the same time wants his or her over attachment result in the sin, to proceed in undetectable way. You cannot control every human being through the law of court and the police department. The reason is that every individual working in any department is with the same psychology. Today, you are hearing the news that an honorable judge of the honorable court has taken huge bribe to protect the injustice! Every employee in every department is influenced by the corruption. The employee may belong to government or administration or parliament or assembly or even judiciary system. Very few only exist, who follow justice due to fear of God. It is very difficult if you say that an atheist can also remain pure. The reason is that one day or other, the atheist will think about the ultimate in following justice. In his mind, certainly, the coming question will be \u201cwhat is the ultimate benefit for me if i follow the justice and what is the ultimate loss to me if i do injustice in an undetectable way?\u201d He will think that since God is absent, there is none to reward him for following the justice and there is none to punish him for doing the injustice in hidden way. If the injustice is not done in the hidden way, there may be punishment in this world by the court of law. If you can escape the punishment here by doing the injustice in talented hidden way, there is materialistic benefit that promotes your enjoyment in this world. The final conclusion will be to do sin in undetectable way so that you can escape the ultimate punishment here and at the same time enjoy the materialistic benefit of the sin in this world. You can propagate the justice through your speech everywhere so that the social balance is maintained. If the social balance is not maintained, your enjoyment here also gets disturbed. Therefore, maintain the social balance to have your personnel enjoyment without any disturbance. Hence, go on influencing everybody through speech to follow justice. Thus, everybody wants to maintain the social balance with selfish motive only and not for the sake of God since God does not exist. Hence, atheism will lead to social chaos one day or other. In the case of theism, there is God to reward you for following the justice. Even if you do the sin in hidden way, the omniscient God will detect and punish you here or the upper world. The religion may be defective due to certain blind and foolish customs and traditions. But, the religion is far better than the atheism because the religion provides the golden theism to control the sin and maintain the social balance. \ufffd\u0005 ",

This is because atheists require evidence and reason to believe in things and there is no good evidence or reason to believe in spirits of this kind. If by spiritual you mean a love for the beauty of nature or for your fellow man then the answer is yes. This is because atheists often love, appreciate and are awed by the beauty and complexity of nature and their fellow man. There is also good evidence that nature and their fellow man exists. ",

I've had plenty of ecstatic, transcendent experiences with music, with nature, with love and all that. All of them are easily explained by evolutionary biology. To me, that doesn't diminish their significance; it enhances them. Nature is far more beautiful and rich with connections than anything our imaginations can come up with -- our imaginations are a product of nature, not separate from it.  Let's take music as an example. As a teenager I bought into the notion that music was magical somehow, above and outside of ordinary existence. As an adult I studied theories of how music is adaptive for humans, the emotional and social functions it serves, the way it's shaped by evolutionary forces just like any other animal behavior. That didn't ruin music for me; it made me take it more seriously. The harder I study the rationalist approach to music, the more important it becomes to me. It's perfectly possible to feel awe and reverence for nature. That awe feels a lot more substantial when I apply it to facts of the world, not imaginary ideas. ",

Although that's misleading, because chemistry is awesome. You can not believe in a god and still believe in spirits, fairies, thought-goblins etc 3) This varies dramatically from person to person. Some atheists buy into all of that, some atheists are sceptical, and of those that are sceptical, there are those that can understand why others could be convinced, and those that don't, and then within those groups there are those who get angry when people make logical fallacies, and then people who don't.

I\u2019ve known a fair share of self-proclaimed secular-rational atheists who, to my absolute surprise, believed in things like reincarnation, karma, communication with the dead, positive energies and other things that are definitely spiritual and non-scientific (though I must stress that some of those atheists insisted to me that their beliefs were pure science, but people don\u2019t want to accept the evidences of the truth out of prejudice. I decided that arguing about this eccentric kind of [pseudo-]scientific faith wasn\u2019t worth it.) ",

We think that Humans are Spiritual but we forget the Spirit is forever and the Human is not. So its the Spirit having a Human Experience, not the other way around. One has to have the awareness that a higher power is always at play and eventually understand that everything is in fact the manifestation of that higher power, he can choose to not call it by the name of God. That is irrelevant, a seeker will be able to find his true self and the true self is identical to the supreme self.

I\u2019ve dabbled in prayer at times, even though I just didn\u2019t believe that there was anyone listening. Still, it felt good to say it and to imagine that a power bigger than me was listening and taking care of me. But just because it felt good, that wasn\u2019t proof to me. I enjoy works of fiction which I know aren\u2019t real either. I believe in many truths, some of them contradictory. I believe that I am a collection of atoms and energy, which will persist after I die. I believe I\u2019m a dad, a son, a brother, a husband. I believe that I am one of the multitudinous living beings on the planet Earth. To me, spirituality is just a shifting of focus from the day-to-day to a different perspective, particularly one where connections between us all become more obvious. Your mileage may vary. ",

The fact that people want to believe that they are not in control of their life and that some strings are pulling them makes them spiritual. People become spiritual when they are facing troubles in life, are under stress and there seems to be no significance or goal. Having a strong mind is not an easy task and that is why a large population is not atheist. We are always looking out for validation in every action we perform and evry event that happens. Even in my case despite being atheist I also do have my doubts sometimes but as I grow and learn more about myself and human mind my doubts are going away. ",

Many Buddhists are atheist, yet consider themselves spiritual - they seem to have no problem with it.  I'd assume that it all comes down to what you personally believe 'spirituality' is and if you believe it requires gods.  If yes: then no, you cannot be both atheist and spiritual.  If no: then yes, you can :) ",

It\u2019s often used in the context of something supernatural, for which I\u2019ve yet to see any evidence for. I reject the concept of spirituality for a few reasons, highlighted below. 1) What is spiritual? What does that mean? I don\u2019t see any evidence for there being a spiritual dimension to life. 2) I see no evidence that I have a spirit. Science has shown us how the body and brain works. There\u2019s no need to invoke the word spiritual as far as that\u2019s concerned. In other words, no one has found a spirit inside a human yet. 3) If I were to use the word spiritual to define my self-growth as a human being, it will most likely be taken in the context of something supernatural or religious. I denounce religion and all things supernatural. They have no place in my life. To me, the word spiritual diminishes the complexity of human psychology. If we want to better our world, we need to better understand ourselves. We can\u2019t do this with spirituality. We can do this with science, and that includes psychology (soft science). We can longer afford to hand over our minds to a pseudo-science like spirituality. We have to educate ourselves about ourselves. This takes hard work. The starting point for me for doing this is science. I trust the scientific method, because I\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s effective at ascertaining the facts. When there\u2019s something that science cannot explain we shouldn\u2019t just fill in the gaps with something supernatural or spiritual. We simply say, we don\u2019t know, and continue investigating. ",

Spiritual can also mean, the practice of psychology mastery. A religious man cannot be spiritual. A Muslim, or a Christian is a word to identify a person. A religious man holds a strong identity, a strong beliefs and ideas about reality. They won\u2019t set themselves free from the suffering of beliefs. Religious practices is not a form of spiritual, it is merely delusional. ",

So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.

Around the thirteenth century, the tem became entangled with beliefs about immaterial souls, supernatural beings, ghosts and so forth.I actually find myself agreeing with this paragraph and I do believe that one does not have to associate Spirituality with Religion if he or she does not want to. I find this to be true in my meditation sessions. I meditate but I don't associate any holy practices or mantras with it. Nope, I just focus on my breath and see my thoughts, none of which requires me to chant anything or pray to God. Please note however that I am just a beginner in this never ending field of spirituality and religion and I do not have a lot to offer as of yet. I may also be wrong at certain places, I don't deny that and even though I believe that we need not associate Spirituality with Religion unnecessarily, I in no way intend to offend anybody who thinks otherwise. It's your opinion and you are entitled to it. I hope that answers your question. And if you happen to be interested in this topic, I'd suggest that you read the book Waking Up by Sam Harris. ",

Perhaps an relationship, a situation where I feel \u2018at one\u2019 with nature or even looking through a telescope at objects in the universe (I\u2019ve built a small observatory in my back garden!)

However, in the broader use of the term 'spiritual' where it acts as shorthand for counselling with trusted friends, contemplation, defining ethics and wonder (among other things) I try to meet those needs individually. I have a circle of trusted friends that I talk to instead of someone who claims a direct conduit to the supernatural. I use meditation to increase my skills at contemplation and reduce anxiety. I define ethics by talking about them and looking at the broad sweep of history. I seek wonder by trying to understand the world as it actually is. Those aren't 'spiritual' needs where they are 'feeding' or 'enhancing' a supernatural part of me. Those are just needs. Maslow's hierarchy is perhaps a more accurate lens to use rather than the vague 'spiritual' ",

So, being spiritual is caring the soul, not the body alone. Body is just the temporary house of soul. God is the target of the soul, but, it has many concepts with many gods that we know. We need not confuse between spirituality and following many gods. Spirituality is concentrating nurturing the soul.

But i would give an example why i think so. My friend is an atheist. I took him to a temple and saw that he was joining his hands in front of the God. I asked him that if he was an atheist then why did he join or folded his hands. He simply asnwered.\"Bro thats what i call stimulation which show that i am in state of some activity.\" This is the reason why i think so.However my perception is not to hurt anyones sentiments.Its just a point of view :) ",

It is a driving force within me to succeed, connect with others, and enjoy life.  This is what I consider the human spirit.  When you define this as coming from where or belonging to something beyond the physiological realm it becomes a belief. Every person has a different biological makeup, which means labeling them as Christian, Atheist, Buddhist, etc. and saying that they can or cannot have certain experiences really doesn't make sense.  We both love and fear the unknown and what is unknown to each person varies.  That realm of the unknown is the realm of spirituality.  And spirituality is the champion of life's adventures in hopes to one day find the answer to why self exists. ",

To me this fact implies that spirituality is a thing that most people feel they need (the reasons for this are manifold & would be better discussed in another thread). For many believers I am at a loss as to why they believe, given the illogical & contradictory nature of religions & their teachings. However, there are probably more people for whom the belief in the promise of eternal paradise is the only thing they have in an otherwise intolerable life. Perhaps the best example of this are those staunch catholics who live in places like Brazil & are condemned to a life of sustaining themselves by picking through the refuse of others. I am an atheist, but I understand that for such people God is the only 'authority' that cares about their plight ",

Meditation is beyond religion and like breathing has benefits for all. There are several good books that teach how to relax through breathing and meditation. There are even many proven medical benefits that result from meditation. With that said, many religions world wide try to take ownership of a very common practice. There are several forms of meditation and not all are created equal. What religion does is give meditation a focus. Some meditate the words of God both day and night in order to hide them in their heart. Others meditate deeper meaning of some sublime thought. The Christian is commanded to set there minds and keep them set on things above. However, as a practice meditation as well as other spiritual disciplines can allow anyone to live a more spiritual life. It is the content that determines the development and destination. ",

An atheist doesn\u2019t believe in gods but that doesn\u2019t mean they might not believe in the soul, or in sundry other spiritual or supernatural things. Millions of Buddhists have a very spiritual belief system, for example, totally god-free. There are people who have religious beliefs centred on nature, on fate/destiny, on who knows what else. ",
