            "answer_text": "If you mean the original city of Pompeii which was buried in AD 79, then no, the site is too fragile for people to live there. There is a modern town of Pompeii which can be incredibly busy and hot during peak tourist season. However, there is a beautiful cathedral and a park in the centre. Evening is the best time to visit when there are fewer tourists - it is cooler, there\u2019s room to wander and lots of excellent places to eat or enjoy a glass of the local wine.   The modern towns of Ercolano (named Resina until 1969) and Portici lie above the approximate site of Herculaneum so people still live ON Herculaneum if not IN it. Ercolano is modern Italian version of the ancient name which links the towns above and below.  ",

Not, of course, in the archeological site- albeit many of the archeologist spend so much time there that you may easily see them as \u201cculture monks\u201d- but indeed in the city, that is also well-known for its sanctuary dedicated to the Holy Virgin of Pompeii.  That\u2019s the inside. Neapolitan baroque is a lesser-known gem of my country: if you love rich and weird, that\u2019s the place where you need to look! ",
