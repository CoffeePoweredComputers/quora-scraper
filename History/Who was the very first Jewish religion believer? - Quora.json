            "answer_text": "Once upon a time \u2026\u2026 A Canaanite version begun by prophet Elijah with the curiously compounded name of two Canaanite Gods Eli as in EL & Yahweh as in Jah, within the Kingdom of Israel in 876BC sought to bring the Judaic version breaking away from the Canaanite version which Sumerian Abram paid his tithe in 1800BC to Canaanite Priest King Melchizedek in the Canaanite hamlet Shalim in Judea. Wicked King Ahab & his Philistine wife Jezebel,with an Hebraic name; \u201cLooking for a Prince\u201d, would dismiss him from court retaining their favorite Canaanite Elohim siblings Baal, Dagan & Asherate. The Clergy of the freed Judean descendants in Babylon, still wearing the Canaanite \u2018cloth\u2019 of Priesthood finding the Sumerian cuneiform libraries in Eridu city picked up the design of the \u201cYahweh Cult\u201d of Prophet Elijah, hoping to get their Judeans followers to embrace their choice of a Canaanite Elohe sibling as the Judaic God Yahweh,hiding the vowels of his name in the tetragrammaton YHWH, from their illiterate followers, who well knew the vowels sounds of all 71 Canaanite Gods, accepted YHWH, as a new God, but retaining Canaanite polytheism. Said Clergy in Eridu city between 536 & 520BC would pinch the historic data from the Sumerians, Judaizing Sumerian Noah King Ziusudra of 2900BC saving a barge load of cattle on the annually over flowing Euphrates River, giving thanks to his Gods. The Clergy would script in a Judaic Noah in 2700BC of a global flood. The Clergy would fashion Judaic Abraham after Sumerian God Enki. They would also script in a Judaic Mose, fashioned after the Akkad King Sargon I; 2334/2279BC, who was deserted by his Priestess mother setting him adrift onto the Euphrates river, as a Babe in a basket. The 12 tribes including Abram, Isaac & Jacob/Israel & his 12 sons worshipped the only existing Canaanite version, who adopted the anthropomorphic theism of the Sumerians in 2315BC, who conceptualized it, eons earlier. There is no merit, value or substance in the question requested. ",

            "answer_text": "Judaism\u2019s rock-solid view is that Abraham and Sarah are the de facto founders of the religion. We regularly refer to the three \u201cAvose\u201d (patriarchs) [Abraham, Isaac, Jacob] and the four \u201cEema\u2019hose\u201d (matriarchs, transliteration from the \u201cNumbers\u201d song near the end of the liturgy for the Passover Seders)[Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Leah]. Abraham and Sarah are the first generation. Additionally, there\u2019s a list of elite prophets in Judaism, forty men and seven women, found in Rashi\u2019s commentary in Tractate Megillah, page 14a, in the Babylonian Talmud. Abraham is first chronologically among the men, Sarah among the women. It is the prophets who communicate the word of God to mankind. As they were the first \u201cJewish\u201d prophets, they are therefore the founders and first believers. ",
