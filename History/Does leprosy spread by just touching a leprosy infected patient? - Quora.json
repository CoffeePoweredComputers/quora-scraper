It is not hereditary and cannot be caught by touch. Scientists believe it is caught through droplets of moisture passed through the air from someone who has leprosy but has not yet started treatment. It takes years, however, of living in close proximity with an untreated leprosy patient to catch the disease. Around 95 per cent of people are thought to be naturally immune to leprosy. But if you find any of these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately. This is a rare disease which can't be left untreated or unconcerned about. Pain areas: in the joints Skin: blister, loss of colour, rashes, redness, or ulcers Sensory: loss of temperature sensation, pins and needles, or reduced sensation of touch Also common: nerve injury or weight loss ",

Early treatment avoids disability. Symptoms: Light coloured or red skin patches with reduced sensation, numbness and weakness in hands and feet. So,the answer for your question is NO. By just touching an affected person,the bacteria will not transmit into your body. ",

And within a week of starting treatment, the patient becomes noninfective to others\u2026 The remaining duration of treatment ( few months to almost a year ) is to kill all the dormant [sleeping] bacteria in the body ",

During WWII Russian prisoners, in the custody of Russians I think, who had been condemned to death were offered the choice of either proceeding with their executions or living amongst lepers. Not surprisingly they elected to live with lepers. Only 1 caught leprosy and that was 20 years later. No original source material only conversation with my physician father who lived through this period and knew about such things. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a little bit complicated so I advise you pick a browser (I use Edge a lot) and ask how is leprosy, or Hansen's disease (the preferred term) spread. Most authorities think it seems to be spread in aerosols from an infected person, i.e. coughing and sneezing. Susceptibility varies from person to person, and between ethnic groups. And actually it is not very contagious, unlike diseases such as measles in which the virus is infectious for up to 2 hours after an infected person coughs or sneezes in a room for instance. Up to 90% of non-immune persons will come down with measles just by walking through that room. Airborne infections are the worst in terms of making a lot of people sick. It's not so bad catching the common cold, but pneumonic plague, Yersinia pestis (old name Pasteurella pestis) is much deadlier than bubonic plague. Same microorganism, but spread differently. One is airborne, the other requires direct contact with exudate from a ruptured bubo, usually through a mucous membrane, because intact, unbroken skin is more resistant to infection. ",
