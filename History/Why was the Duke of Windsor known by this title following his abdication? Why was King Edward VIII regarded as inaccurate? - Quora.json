            "answer_text": "As indicated by several other answers, Edward VIII could no longer be referred to as King for one principal reason: unlike other states which have a history of voluntary abdication as a form of retirement in which the term \u201cKing X\u201d is used to honour the retiree, Britain did not have a tradition for abdication. Avoiding a rival court The British government and establishment at the time was deeply concerned to ensure continuity of parliamentary democracy within a constitutional monarchy by ensuring stability of the crown. That required clarity on the future of the crown\u2019s succession: through The King (George VI) and descent through his family. Bear in mind that at the time of the abdication it was unknown if Edward VIII would have children or not, and should he have had a family and remained on British soil this would have risked public attention divided between two potential \u2018courts\u2019. Having multiple \u2018courts\u2019 (informally) was not in itself new in Britain. During the era of George I, his son was popular and there was both public and political attention upon him. As the son and successor, he was always technically a rival to his father\u2019s \u2018official\u2019 court. The same applied for George II and his son Frederick. Likewise, during the era of Victoria, her son Edward\u2014who was Prince of Wales for several decades\u2014was technically a rival \u2018social court\u2019 in the absence of his mother, run from his estate at Sandringham and from his London residence at Marlborough House. Ensuring that Edward\u2019s title did not reflect a kingly status was part of the picture. While these other rival courts were tolerable since they were effectively the households of the successor (heir apparent) to the sovereign, having one led by Edward who may have had a son, and another led by George VI who had only daughters for heirs, was considered a risk. What to call a post-abdication former King This was a complex process. There was some view that an king post-abdication would be an ordinary citizen, a commoner, and would have no special title or style\u2014i.e., Mr Edward Windsor. Another view (which prevailed) was that under Letters Patent 1917 he was regardless of his abdication, still the direct and legitimate son of a former king (George V) and therefore entitled to the style and title of HRH The Prince Edward. This was how he was introduced to the public for his broadcast announcing his abdication. George VI chose to make him a Duke on the advice that, should there be a need to combat any of Edward\u2019s vast popularity, he would not be able to be encouraged to stand for parliament and enter the Commons if he had a peerage. Windsor was suggested and settled upon as a useful title that had no real implications since it did not utilise or associate Edward with any existing territorial title in the United Kingdom. This is also why he was not given any subsidiary titles. Although he was titled and styled \u201cHRH The Duke of Windsor\u201d from the day after the abdication\u2014since the new King, as fount of honour, is able to command anyone be styled in any particular way simply through declaration, the title and style was later confirmed by Letters Patent. While Edward abdicated in December 1936, it took the unusually long period of five months to draft and sign the letters patent that formally created him Duke of Windsor. This was due to a very significant controversy over whether they could withhold HRH from his wife and any potential children once he was married. While the reason often discussed for withholding an HRH from Wallis Simpson was to punish her, the actual historical documents are somewhat different. There were substantial discussions, letters, memos and so on exchanged between the prime minister, the home office, the palace, several private secretaries and several lawyers and politicians. The purpose of these debates was to determine a mechanism to withhold HRH and\u2014again\u2014to ensure that Edward did not produce a rival court by having a family who counted as \u2018royalty\u2019. Technically, under common law, Wallis was entitled to an exact mirror of Edward\u2019s titles and styles: If he was HRH The Duke of Windsor, then she was technically to be HRH The Duchess of Windsor. As son of a King, his children (if he had any) would technically therefore also be HRH Prince X and HRH Princess Y. The key concern was that, under an old Victorian era statement, the only people who were HRH were in the line of succession or were the wife of such a person. An HRH held by his family members would potentially imply a right to succeed, in the public\u2019s mind even if excluded by legislation. In the end, the letters patent stated clearly that it was by special pleasure and will of the King that Edward, having been born in the line of succession, could retain his HRH but that it could not by virtue of marriage or childbirth, be extended through him to others. This is why subsequent to the abdication, and after extensive deliberation, he was titled and styled HRH The Duke of Windsor but his wife (and potential children) would not carry the royal style of HRH. This was entirely about the idea of a rival court that would disrupt continuity of the crown and its succession. Indeed, during one conference on the matter at Westminster Palace in April 1937, it was clearly stated the entire issue was round the matter of rivalry. The minutes of the meeting state that: \u201cLord Wigram said that so long as the Duke of Windsor remained out of the country he agreed that the matter was not one of practical importance but, if he came here, the fact that his wife was \"Her Royal Highness\" would put the King in a difficult position. The Duke and Duchess would start a clique of their own with what would amount to a second Court and this would be bad for the Monarchy.\u201d So you can see the concern that was given to the simple matter of naming was a concern around stability rather than punishment, or trying to develop a more majesty-like courtesy title for an ex-king as was eventually done in Spain. How to refer to him now It is fine to refer to him today as Edward VIII. The abdication did not invalidate his short period as King, and he is from that perspective just as much King as was George III, George VI, Victoria, etc. Referring historically to him is different from addressing him, and in that context he is very often historically known today as Edward VIII whether that was during his reign or afterwards.

            "answer_text": "Both the government and the new king, George VI, were keen to put Edward VIII in his place and get him out of sight. They didn\u2019t want him in the UK, nor retaining his title of King because he might\u2019ve established a rival court. If that had happened, it would have undermined the whole concept of monarchy, and people might\u2019ve started taking sides of the two brothers. Let\u2019s not forget that Edward VIII was enormously popular as Prince of Wales and King, so they had to \u201ctransfer\u201d these sentiments onto the new king. Choice is the enemy of monarchy; if people were wanting the old king back, the monarchy begins to resemble a presidency. And the royals certainly don\u2019t want that! Re-branding him as a lower-ranking royal distanced him from the throne in the minds of the populace. It was important though that Edward be given a royal title so that he could not stand for election (should he choose to do so) - which would create the problems outlined above. Windsor was probably chosen because its closest connection was to the royal family and the castle, rather than another town and its people (who might have rallied around him). I can only surmise that he was made a duke to preserve his dignity, and to maintain the notion that he was still royal, even if not king anymore. But he was then effectively banished from his own country, as the royals threatened to cut off his allowance if he came back to the UK. Edward\u2019s situation was different to say, King Juan Carlos of Spain or King Albert II of Belgium (who retain their titles of King after their abdications), because his abdication was not from one generation to the next (which in the case of Spain and Belgium would have happened anyhow in time), nor was it due to age. Edward and his brother were similar in age and it was unexpected that his brother take the crown - the two were healthy rivals for each other, as there was not much in terms of age or appearance to differentiate between them. It was important that Edward be downgraded, shooting down any hopes his subjects might have had of him returning to be regarded fondly. Indeed, this has continued to happen in the history books - a disproportionate amount of bad press has blackened Edward\u2019s name, and continues to do so. The land was too small for two kings; one of them had to go so the other could thrive. For those who say there can\u2019t be two kings/monarchs at one time in the UK, this is untrue. Henry II\u2019s son was actually crowned king in his father\u2019s lifetime, and titled \u201cHenry the Young King\u201d. William III and Mary II reigned jointly, both as sovereign monarchs. The rules are simply made to fit the times. Spain and Belgium probably wanted to keep the dignity of Juan Carlos and Albert II. This traditionally does not happen in the Netherlands, where the former Queen Beatrix is now a princess. The rules are made up according to each country. ",
