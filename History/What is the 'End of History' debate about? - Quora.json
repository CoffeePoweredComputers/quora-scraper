            "answer_text": "The End of History is a thesis posited by American political scientist and economist Francis Fukuyama, which essentially states that liberal democracy is the end stage of the evolution of governance, and cites the ability of liberal democracies to form long-lasting, stable partnerships, resulting in diminished levels of global conflict, therefore causing the \u201cend\u201d of history. This would be a theoretical period in the future in which almost all nations have transitioned into stable democracies and utilize intergovernmental forums such as the United Nations to solve disputes, rather than force of arms. The thesis is best outlined in Fukuyama\u2019s 1992 book The End of History and the Last Man, which argues that history since the French Revolution has been a continual progression towards the dominance of liberal democracy. He acknowledges that there are periods of backsliding, but, like a meandering river, the path will find its way to that final point. When asked what this future would look like, he said this: The End of History was never linked to a specifically American model of social or political organization. Following Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve, the Russian-French philosopher who inspired my original argument, I believe that the European Union more accurately reflects what the world will look like at the end of history than the contemporary United States. The EU's attempt to transcend sovereignty and traditional power politics by establishing a transnational rule of law is much more in line with a \"post-historical\" world than the Americans' continuing belief in God, national sovereignty, and their military. Fukuyama does not assert that there will not be conflicts, or even wars, rather that these events will be of considerably smaller scale, and cites the evolution of warfare away from continent shattering brawls to precision strikes conducted from many miles away. He also asserts that because the governments of the nations will be directly accountable to their people, the incentive to reach settlement as quickly and painlessly as possible will be much greater than many nations currently feel. The debate is had as to whether or not this thesis will prove true, a question I suspect the jury will be out on for a good many decades at least. I, personally, do believe in some aspects, however I strongly suspect that humanity has one more proper world-altering conflict left in the bank before we finally extract our heads from our collective rear.

            "answer_text": "In 1989 Francis Fukuyama published an article in The National Interest (based on a talk given a few months earlier at the University of Chicago) called \u201cThe End of History?\u201d (Note the question mark.) In due course it matured into a very-much-expanded book called The End of History and the Last Man, which appeared in 1991. The book and the article provoked enormous discussion and controversy. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Fukuyama argued, liberal democracy had emerged as the only viable model of governance for the future. But the victory of liberal democracy wasn\u2019t merely a matter of contingent fact, as if the Western nations just happened to have economically and militarily out-performed the communist states. Liberal democracy not only was, but deserved to be, criterial as the form of government best suited to sheltering human flourishing, and its triumph is partly explained by that very fact. The \u201cend\u201d of history that Fukuyama had in mind didn\u2019t refer to the cessation of history, as if human beings might somehow stop acting, innovating, and changing the world. It referred to the goal of political history, specifically in the sense of the attempt to discover the appropriate form of government for human beings. During the Cold War (1946\u20131991), the great debate about the appropriate form of government was between communism (led by the Soviet Union) and democracy (led by the United States and her allies). Communism\u2019s claim was that liberal democracy was not the best possible state \u2013 that there was a society that provided its members with even greater security and freedom than democracy and that the Soviet Union was in the process of building it. Western countries saw little if any evidence of freedom in the Soviet Union and the countries it controlled, and most people believed that real progress, both moral and material, came more easily to multiparty democracies with market-based economies. With the overthrow and abolition of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the latter, it seemed to many that communist ideology would never again be taken seriously as an alternative to liberal democracy. \u201cHistory,\u201d in the sense of the search for the kind of government most conducive to human flourishing, had in this sense come to an end. The job from now on would not be to debate which kind of government is best, but only to establish liberal democracies wherever they didn\u2019t yet exist. Debate then turned to how best to spread liberal democracy. To simplify drastically, there were those who thought that the spread of democracy would be gradual and driven by the peoples of the not-yet-democratic states themselves (albeit with our encouragement and assistance), and those who thought it could be accomplished militarily, by removing at least some non-democratic regimes and establishing democracy in them as an occupying power (\u201cregime change\u201d). The latter got the upper hand for a while, but the outcome of their efforts was such that most people came to reject the military road to democracy. The militarists were widely discredited, although they have by no means gone away. In addition, the difficulty of establishing democracy in places like Iraq and Afghanistan persuaded not a few that perhaps democracy is not the best form of government for all human beings. Perhaps the non-democratic peoples of the world should be left to their own devices. Some people even came to think that democracy may have run its course in the West \u2013 that our problems are such as can best be addressed by more authoritarian forms of government. So the great debate about the best form of government goes on, although the terms have certainly changed and communism is no longer a live option.
