            "answer_text": "Why do Mongolians look like Koreans? In 2003, Kim Wook, a biology professor at Dankook University, analyzed the genetic variation of Y chromosomes inherited through paternal systems in samples taken from an East Asian group. As a result, Koreans have found all the genetic types common in Mongolia and eastern and southern Siberia, as well as those common in Southeast Asia and South and North China. Koreans were most genetically similar to the Manchurian people in northeastern China, who are Southeast Asians among the various peoples of East Asia, and also to some Southeast Asians, such as Chinese seedlings and Vietnam. This shows that the Korean people are largely a mixed race between the northern and southern regions. Yayo, who delivered farming culture and Japanese language more than 2,300 years Corso sui Meridiani e Punti di Agopuntura per non medici is also genetic evidence indicating that the Yi people moved through the Korean Peninsula to mainland Japan. In 2006, Kim also analyzed mitochondrial DNA, which runs maternal oil fields. Unlike Y chromosomes, which are delivered only to sons through fathers, mitochondrial DNA is delivered to both sons and daughters through mothers. Moreover, mitochondrial DNA has the advantage of having a high mutation rate and no intersection. For this reason, it is possible to trace ancestors by analyzing the state of Haplotype, a mutant information that occurs during the evolution of mankind. Haplotype refers to a series of unusual sequence of bases or genotypes that can be closely associated with multiple genes and expressed as a unit. Haplo Group can be viewed as a group with the same mitochondrial DNA genotype. Of the three Koreans, one was the largest group of Haplo Group D, which is widely distributed in Mongolia and Northeast Asia in central and northern China, with about 60 percent of Koreans classified as northerners and 40 percent as southernists. According to the analysis of the degree of genetic differentiation, Koreans were close to Chinese ethnic Koreans, Manchurians and Japanese. However, the Chinese Han people, along with Vietnam, were tied to other systems, showing some genetic differences from Koreans. The Han Chinese in Beijing, which belongs to Northeast Asia, showed somewhat similar results to that of Koreans, but they were genetically different from those in the southern part of China. In particular, the Manchurians and ethnic Koreans living in Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang, three northeastern Chinese provinces, were genetically closer to Koreans than the Chinese Han. For this reason, Kim said, \"The genetic characteristics of Goguryeo people who used to work on the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria are closer to the Korean group than the Chinese Han group.\" View original text : \ud55c\uad6d\uc778\uc758 \ud54f\uc904, \ub204\uad6c\uc640 \ub354 \uac00\uae5d\ub098? P.S. : I think this paper is universal, but it may be wrong about specificity. The reason is that in my case, my ancestor was a Chinese naturalized in Goryeo 1,000 years ago. Some other Koreans also became naturalized in Korea in India, Arabia and Vietnam during the Three Kingdoms Period about 1,000 years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Korean don't exactly look like Mongolian. There are subtle differences that you can pick up, unless you are not too familiar with both groups. Their physical appearance differences is as much different as Caucasus people vs European or even more. Koreans belong to East Asian race, Mongolians belong to North Asian race. Average Korean face  Average face of Mongolian  The first noticeable difference is Mongol's eyes are more slender and longer than Korean's eyes. Their eyes are as long as eyebrow or longer. Mongol's is straighter than Korean\u2019s nose with more defined nasal tip. Their eyebrow is thinner and straighter. Their skin is fairer with a reddish tint. While Koreans have more pale yellowish skin with a very noticeable tint. There are some Koreans that look Mongols and vice versa. That's because they are genetically very close. Koreans Y DNA is East Asian related while mtDNA is North Asian related. In Silla Dynasty, people from North Asia mixed with Koreans. Throughout neolithic times, there was some intermixing with Nomadic Northern North Asian people. Unlike Chinese and Japanese, Koreans are racially very pure due to less intermixing with other ethnics and isolation from outsiders for a long period. They have the purest East Asian blood and the most East Asian looking people. ",
