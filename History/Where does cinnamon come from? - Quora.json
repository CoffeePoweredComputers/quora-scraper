            "answer_text": "The ground spice and the curled \u201ccinnamon sticks\u201d that are commonly known as cinnamon are actually the dried inner bark of the Cassia tree which is a close cousin of true cinnamon (Cinnamon Verum). Most commercial cinnamon is of the Cassia variety (Cinnamon cassia.) If you were to find true Ceylonese cinnamon (you can buy it on Amazon) the flavor is more subtle and less pronounced than the cinnamon most people are used to. There are some chemical differences between the 2 varieties which may be worth noting. See: Ceylon vs. Cassia \u2014 Not All Cinnamon Is Created Equal See also: Cinnamon - Wikipedia ",
