            "answer_text": "Stalin was the man of cold calculation. I think he made a simple calculation. If his son stayed at German hands until the end of the war, there would to be two options eventually\u2026 If Russians lose the war, all Soviet upper class ( Supposed to be no classes in Soviet System) would be annihilated or pacified anyway\u2026Therefore it would not matter\u2026 If Germans lose the war, German leftovers would race to give Stalin his son back for favors in show trials\u2026 Famously, his answer was clear and there was a logic behind it: \u2018\u2019Nazi forces captured Stalin\u2019s son, Yakov Dzhugashvili. When the Nazis proposed exchanging him for their captured field marshal Friedrich Paulus, Stalin retorted \u201cI will not trade a marshal for a lieutenant.\u201d Source of the quoted paragraphs: Nazi Forces Captured Stalin's Son, Stalin Didn't Care - He Despised Him Therefore eventually all the roads led to Rome. The real problem for Stalin was the scenario that they ever let his son go before the end of war\u2026 Stalin regarded all Soviet prisoners of wars as traitors because it was forbidden to surrender to Germans. There was the principle of fight or die.. When they returned from captivity most of them faced punishment. Fortunately, his son ran through wire on purpose in captivity and German soldiers solved the problem for Stalin\u2026 They provided Stalin best propaganda device over his son\u2019s death. An iron will leader who even does not negotiate for his own son\u2019s life. German camp soldier who shot Yakov probably was not aware who he was. The irony is that his son Yevgeny who recently passed in Moscow was a firm defender of his grandfather\u2019s legacy.  Source of the picture: Outspoken Stalin grandson 'found dead' \u2018\u2019 Published in the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, the article said Soviet leaders including Stalin were \"bound by much blood\" by ordering the execution of about 20,000 Polish prisoners of war at Katyn. Mr Dzhugashvili argued that the article blackened his grandfather's reputation and was defamatory. He took his case to the European court after various courts in Russia threw it out. He also argued that the Soviet Union would not have gone downhill if his father lived longer. More recently he accused President Putin of being \"without brains\". Source of the quoted paragraphs: Outspoken Stalin grandson 'found dead' A mystery to solve \u2018\u2019 German documents suggest that Yakov Dzhugashvili, the eldest son of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, died in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp north of Berlin in April 1943 during an attempted escape. The coroners' report says he was electrocuted to death and then shot through the skull.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: Photo Gallery: The Mystery Surrounding Stalin's Son - DER SPIEGEL - International  Source of the picture: Photo Gallery: The Mystery Surrounding Stalin's Son - DER SPIEGEL - International \u2018\u2019 For decades after the war, it remained unclear exactly how Dzhugashvili had died. Dzhugashvili, a lieutenant in the Red Army, had fallen into German hands in the summer of 1941, but his father had vehemently refused to include him in any prisoner exchanges. It was only in 1968 that documents turned up at the State Department in Washington that made it possible to reconstruct the prisoner's last few years. They indicate that Stalin's son succumbed to a prison psychosis and conclude that his death was tantamount to a suicide.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: https://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/photo-gallery-the-mystery-surrounding-stalin-s-son-fotostrecke-93137.html  Source of the picture: Photo Gallery: The Mystery Surrounding Stalin's Son - DER SPIEGEL - International \u2018\u2019 Svetlana Alliluyeva, Stalin's only daughter, has said that her father rebuffed offers to get his son back as part of a prisoner exchange. \"He was a deeply peaceful person -- soft, a little clumsy, very quiet, but inwardly solid and committed,\" Alliluyeva said of her half-brother, Yakov. \"He had nothing in common with his father except the almond-shaped Caucasian eyes.\" Source of the quoted paragraphs: Photo Gallery: The Mystery Surrounding Stalin's Son - DER SPIEGEL - International There are some questions to ask\u2026 Did Yakov Dzhugashvili choose suicide to relieve his father of burden ? Was he getting threats from other Soviet inmates to kill himself and stop being a propaganda tool for Germans? Still, so many questions to ask over the death of Stalin\u2019s son. ",

            "answer_text": "Because, like he said himself, he couldn\u2019t exchange a Field-Marshal for a Lieutenant, and furthermore, he couldn\u2019t really exchange any prisoner at all. The Germans offered to exchange Yakov for Friedrich Paulus, the German commander taken prisoner at Stalingrad. Hitler had elevated him to Marshal right before the German lines collapsed, expecting that Paulus would die at his post\u2014no Generalfeldmarschall in the history of Austria, Prussia or united Germany had ever been taken prisoner by the enemy. At least if the Germans got him back, they could say they redeemed him. (Even though Hitler despised him for surrendering.) In one of the books on Stalin I have, I think it\u2019s Court of the Red Tsar but I\u2019m not sure, Stalin explained why he refused the deal. Stalin said that as leader of the USSR, he was asking millions of sons of Russian families to fight and be exposed to possible capture by the Germans. If he made a deal to free his own son, how could he then say no if someone\u2019s mother approached him and asked him to free her son as well? And he said as much in his formal response to the German offer: \"You have in your hands not only my son Yakov, but millions of my sons. Either you free them all or my son will share their fate.\" That is the way it had to be. Stalin was correct\u2014he could not have a double standard for his own family. Later on, when Hitler tried to swap his nephew Leo Raubal, also taken prisoner at Stalingrad, for Yakov, Stalin again refused. (Leo survived 12 years of Soviet captivity before being allowed to go home in 1955.) The Germans tried to coerce Yakov into collaborating with them, and he categorically refused. After 1943, no more was heard about him in German propaganda, and we now know that he died on 14 April 1943 when he ran into an electrified fence, almost certainly in a suicide. The Germans never publicized this, but it seems that Yakov chose to kill himself to end his use in Nazi propaganda and to ensure he didn\u2019t \u201ccrack\u201d under torture and collaborate. While Yakov refused to cooperate, the Germans did drop leaflets on Russian cities boasting about having captured him, and falsely accusing his father of fleeing Moscow for Samara\u2014he sent the government, diplomatic corps and his family there, but never left Moscow himself.  \"Do not shed your blood for Stalin! He has already fled to Samara! His own son has surrendered! If Stalin's son is saving his own skin, then you are not obliged to sacrifice yourself either!\" When the war was over, Stalin conducted a massive search for his son and to find out his fate. When he learned what had happened, he considered Yakov to have died a hero\u2019s death. The son finally won his father\u2019s respect in the way he died. The story of Yakov during the war is just another example of how people twist a story to dehumanize a person who is objectively a bad guy even if you just stick to the facts. Stalin disliked Yakov, but he actually saw his son off when he went to the front, telling him to \u201cgo and fight!\u201d All three of Stalin\u2019s sons\u2014Yakov, Vasily and the unacknowledged Konstantin Kuzakov\u2014were officers in the Soviet military during WW2, and they were treated the same as any others.
