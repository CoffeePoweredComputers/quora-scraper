            "answer_text": "He wasn\u2019t a cruel or narcissistic king unlike his great-great-great-grandfather, Louis XIV. In fact, primary accounts claim that he was good-natured and had good intentions. But when dealing with such leadership, a good person doesn\u2019t necessarily make a good ruler. He was weak and indecisive and failed to alleviate the economic and social problems that plagued 18th-century France. Additionally, he was heavily influenced by his Austrian wife Marie Antoinette, whose loyalty to the French people was at best shallow. As I saw once on Quora concerning the controversy over Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian, there are 3 questions we can ask to form an overall assessment of Louis\u2019 reign: Did France become stronger and more secure under Louis XVI\u2019s rule? No. France did defeat Great Britain during the American Revolution, helping the fledgling United States win its independence, but this didn\u2019t put France in a position stronger than that of Britain, as the British were expanding their power in India and were showing early signs of industrialization. France\u2019s entrance into the Revolutionary War also further drained its already tenuous economy, virtually bankrupting the country. This left France prone to famine and inflation, since the price of basic foods like bread soared with the royal government in deep debt. Did Louis XVI\u2019s reign improve the lives of the French people? No. It was said that he and Marie Antoinette sometimes gave bread to hungry peasants passing by the Versailles palace, but he did little to improve France\u2019s economy, which was essential to the people\u2019s food supply. His inability to enact decisive economic and political reforms is shown in his frequent changing of ministers in the years leading up to the French Revolution. I don\u2019t think he even sent organized relief efforts to provide the starving French people with food. In his social policy, he was somewhat influenced by the Enlightenment; he tried to end the persecution of minority groups such as Protestants and Jews as well as institute some legal reforms, but the people still had very little voice in the government (the lower and middle classes, which comprised 97% of France\u2019s population, represented only 1/3 of the votes in the Estates-General of 1789). Did Louis XVI leave a positive legacy behind for France and the world? Not really. He gets marginal credit in America for helping the American Revolution, but most people, when they hear his name, think of his beheading by guillotine in 1793. His rule in France didn\u2019t accomplish lasting achievements, other than his own undermining during the French Revolution. In the end, it\u2019s hard to judge whether his execution was justified. You could argue that he was innocent of crimes against France and the French people, but it is essential to understand the famine, poverty, and political repression they endured under the Ancien Regime, as well as the critical situation the fledgling French Republic faced against the growing coalition of hostile monarchies across Europe. It\u2019s arguable that Louis\u2019 execution was a political necessity, to promote the Revolution and demonstrate the Republic\u2019s opposition to monarchy. Additionally, the royal family had attempted to flee France in 1791 to avoid the Revolution, which caused many people to see him as a coward and traitor. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly not. He was perhaps not shrewd enough to rise to the occasion during the turmoils of the French Revolution. Greatest injustice was done to him by the rabid republicans, particularly the Jacobins and the Montagnards, especially Robespierre, Danton, Saint-Just et al. They sent the King (also Queen Marie Antoinette) to the guillotine. Neither of them deserved it though. How ironic that all the 3 republicans I mentioned plus many more lost their heads the same way. Though I am not a person of French nationality, I lived there for quite some time. I learnt French language and culture very well. I maintain close intimate relations with many native French friends there, visiting them quite often. I do love France as much as I love my own country. I am trying to put my humble contribution create a solid bridge between our two countries. Therefore I hope that the French people will not mind my rather honest opinion. ",
