            "answer_text": "The British banned all forms of torture along with behaviour they deemed inhumane. Prosperous British India A Revelation William Digby The forms of torture prohibited included; barbarous executions, mutilation of criminals, extraction of evidence by torment, bloody and injurious ordeals and cutting off the noses of women. They also prohibited voluntary self torture; hook swinging, thigh piercing, tongue extraction and falling on knives. Many forms of suicide were also prohibited; crushing by idol cars, drowning in wells and rivers and jumping off cliffs. Temple sacrifices of children were banned, dedication to the Ganges by sacrifice to crocodiles, burial alive, self immolation, etc. All forms of slavery; hereditary, predial and importation were prohibited. (Page 16 of text) It took a long time for such colonialism to be accepted. In many cases the Indians did not want to accept such imposition. Indian religion and culture had long accepted many of these things. The Arthashastra & Sharia law had mandated cutting the hands off thieves for 1000 years in India, many questioned the cheek of the British to prohibit it. Punishments and torture in ancient India included all forms of dismemberment, poisoning, death by elephant crushing and all manner of cruelties. Political violence was pervasive in Ancient India. Violence as a way of life. Under British administration there was a very notable torture scandal in 1854. Not just against criminals, but against villagers also in order to extract tax. Allegations were heard in the House of Commons in 1854 which formed the basis of the Madras Torture Commission Report of 1855. The torture commission heard evidence from nearly 2000 people who claimed that the police and tax agents routinely used torture. Of course, they were Indians making allegations against Indians - but why had the East India Company not stopped these practices? The Madras Native Association had vigorously lobbied the British parliament that such behaviour must be rooted out before the East India Company had it's charter renewed! The Company enacted policies to stop such behaviour, but after the Great Uprising (aka Sepoy Mutiny aka Devil's Wind) of 1857 the Company was dissolved. Of course they had their excuses. How could a single British administrator in 100,000 people stop such behaviour? But should they not have? Has this culture not be seen until the present day because of their inaction? The lists of tortures alleged to have been done by Indians in British service included; physical assault, being tied up in the sun, pinched, tied up on a tree, in a bag of chilli, even sodomy. Now some may say that such things occur in India today, but is that not because the British did not stop it? India's torture record is dire - but Britain has little to crow about Should they not have rooted it out? Sure, people were no longer dismembered as they once had been under native rule, but the UK authorities were shocked at the time. This was a major scandal. Sadly, due to the widespread massacres & mutilations of Europeans in the subsequent year, the mood of moral outrage evaporated. If you wish to read further; Hidden narratives of torture and \"indian torture\" and the madras torture commission report of 1855 It is not the torture of the high European sort [\u2026] Indian torture is ready, impromptu, ingenious, cheap, annoying, disgusting, revolting and petty in the extreme [\u2026] It is the torture of very wicked children. (The Times, 3 sep. 1855 Modern researchers say that this is so shocking because the British made a great show of being enlightened, but were in fact conniving in abuses in police stations. They continued to blame not themselves, but Indians! So deep rooted, however, has the evil been found, and so powerful the force of habit, arising from the unrestrained licence exercised in such acts of cruelty and oppression under the former rulers of this country, that it has not been practicable, notwithstanding the vigorous measures adopted, wholly to eradicate it, from the almost innate propensity of the generality of native officers in power to resort to such practices on the one hand, and the submission of the people on the other; and accordingly the abuse still prevails in the Police Department, although undoubtedly not to the same extent as formerly. (MADRAS, 1855, p. 5). torture is ordinarily applied only when there are very good grounds for believing that the really guilty party is the sufferer. [It continues] Indeed it seems to be the universal opinion among the natives themselves, that in criminal cases the practice is not only necessary but right. It excites no abhorrence, no astonishment, no repugnance, in their minds. (MADRAS, 1855, p. 34). The police reforms of 1860 increased European supervision and introduced a detailed code of conduct. A modern student (Aditya Kumar) has written that this was racist and must have made the problem worse. After all, was the problem not actually that Indians were collecting tax for colonialists? If tax had to be increased in order to pay for European supervision, would that not make the problem worse? Was European supervision not actually racist & a means to spy on people instead of torture prevention? After all, were the revenue officers not acting in a colonial job, having supplanted native style tax gatherering job titles? Even though the British wrote a report against torture, did that not serve their racist interests in describing Indians as torturers so that they could increase their power? By describing Indians as torturers were they not trying to normalise their own violence by pretending it was unavoidable in an Indian context? And is torture in India today not evidence that it was created by colonialism rather than - as the British claimed - an Indian characteristic? I am not to judge, but this is the major scandal of torture under British administration. q=https://www.brown.edu/academics/history/sites/academics-history/files/images/Kumar%252C%2520Aditya_Thesis.pdf&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjQ3O_k-ZLaAhUMBMAKHWxsB9YQFggNMAE&usg=AOvVaw2CkJ9HP0O-BtTjb2xWX5ZS A secondary example is the Cellular Jail. Cellular Jail - Wikipedia which took political prisoners at various times. Transport across the \u201cKala Pani\" was deemed torturous, as was the food, individual cells, lack of soap, forced work & punishment by beating. Various investigations were held, but the political prisoners engaged in hunger strike for better conditions (as like mainland prisoners) for all inmates. Forced feeding led to 3 deaths leading to the prisoners being returned. During the Japanese occupation of world war 2, records have been lost. Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands - Wikipedia. The Japanese conducted several massacres of the Azad Hind population as well as tortures like breaking arms before execution. In subsequent years, the oral history of the political prisoners have claimed that the prison was (first) torturous & later torture due to cruelty of guards, forced work, beatings, the presence of cockroaches, breach of caste through use of chain gangs, etc. It is most common to hear that the night urination bowl (lota) was too small which meant that prisoners had to urinate on the floor of the 13\u2032 by 7\u2032 cell & thus they came into contact with the urine. Which was 'torture'. In the most recent books based on oral history it is common to declare 'torture', especially the display of a rack used for beatings (we do not know when/ where this came from - under British or Japanese). Also mentioned is the required punishment to stand in the corner fit several hours wearing handcuffs. As a torture. Sadly; evidenciary comparison of first hand sources has not been conducted in the modern era on a major level. Confinement in the Cellular Jail, Port Blair P.S. \u201cViolence\u201d between Indians, by Europeans on Indians and by Indians on Europeans was extensively studied and the subject of contrasting dialogues between the vernacular press and the English language press. It falls outside of the remit of \u201ctorture\u201d, but if interested you can read into issues like \u201cthe boot and spleen\u201d. This contemporary article by Jordana Bailkin is a quite good (anti colonialist British perspective) article which shows the degree to which violence by British and Indian people was argued over by our ancestors. https://www.google.co.uk/url?q=https://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/students/modules/hi297/lectureandseminartimetable/seminar2/the-boot-and-the-spleen-when-was-murder-possible-in-british-india.pdf&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjGlNOgi5PaAhVoC8AKHSdoAq8QFggLMAA&usg=AOvVaw0gItDAhbwRrAS9p7sLdtTE ",

            "answer_text": "If we come across the sites like Wikipedia, or even BBC thought it's a British news channel. We can discover that the torture by the British done to the Indians isn't far behind the methods of torture committed by the Mughals. The British used cannons to execute Indians in the rebellion of 1857. There is still a skull of a sepoy in a British pub, whose head was blown off by a cannon. This was published in the BBC news ~ What a skull in an English pub says about India's 1857 mutiny  The skull belonged to a 32-year-old Indian soldier who revolted against the British  This 3rd pic seemed even more pathetic to me.  This is the pic of a Sikkimeese woman in West Bengal, India who is carrying her British master on her back ~ A Sikkimese woman carrying a British man on her back, West Bengal, India, c. 1900. There are some controversies regarding this pic stating that this was actually a French Officer, but most of the sites say that this was indeed a British Officer in Sikkim, India. But whether it's a British or French Officer it doesn't matter, what matters is that how pathetic it is to see a woman like this. Isn't this kinds of torture too much bellow the humanity, I don't think Mughals could stoop so low to commit this types of torture to anyone. Infact during the rebellion of 1857 Britishers used the torture methods of the Mughals to execute the Indians, link ~ Blowing from a gun - Wikipedia We all have heard the great Bengal famine which killed around 4.7 to 6 Million Bengalis alone in West Bengal. So there isn't any need to mention their forms of torturing and killing of people ( especially Indians, Irish, Africans ) through starvation. So if this isn't brutal I don't know what is. But still UK tries to neutralize all these facts by throwing India and Indians in a negative light, we can see so many articles published by the British newspaper like BBC who solely critisizes India, China and other Asian countries. But can we see them publishing any articles like this on how much horrific was their imperial past? ",
