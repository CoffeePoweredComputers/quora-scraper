            "answer_text": "In my opinion, we need a change in our thinking about wealth. To wit: Money is not speech. You do not have a First Amendment right to spend as much as you want. That leads to effectively purchasing offices and policies, which is inimical to good governance.Money is not a mark of success. Particularly inherited money. I can probably score a lot of runs if I start out on third base with a lead and every time I am thrown out, Daddy and Mommy pay off the umpire to let me go back to third base. (See Bush, George W. and Trump, Donald.)Skill at acquiring wealth does not automatically transfer to any other domain, so even a self-made billionaire may be a terrible leader, particularly if he is ideologically rigid. To use a non-political example, one merely need to look at the hedge fund jackal who is ruining Sears and K-Mart right now. Really good at making money, but incompetent at everything else.Some possible concrete steps that do not involve the obvious hard limits on spending: Ban anonymous political spending. Every dollar spent must be tracked back to a publicly acknowledged individual. All individuals and entities donating more than 10,000 dollars a year are audited by the IRS for each year that their donations exceed that amount with an especial focus on shadow donors.All candidates must publicly list all of their donors on a web site. All PACs and lobbying groups must do the same. No PAC or lobbying group may accept anonymous donations.The tax records of all elected officials immediately fall into the public domain on the day that they take the oath of office. No exceptions. Failure to release the records constitutes resignation with the further sanction of being unable to run for office again.These suggestions may help address our problems, but they are not a magic bullet by any means. We still need to address the crisis of confidence in government employees, our irrational fear of cooperation to advance the public good, and our unwillingness to pay for good governance. ",

            "answer_text": "A complete and total renovation, from the top down, would be necessary. The parasites of international high finance capital, have such a lockdown on the entire establishment. Bought off politicians, along with the control of the mass media of news and entertainment and academia, firmly in their grip. It would take nothing short of total revolution, at a grass roots level, in order to correct the damage that has been done. As far as what form of system to replace it with; We would be best to keep a Constitutional Republic, with a socio-economic platform conducive to Third Position. Breaking free from the Thraldom of Interest and twin evils of both Communism and Capitalism. ",
