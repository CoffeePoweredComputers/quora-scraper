            "answer_text": "Intelligence agencies have long deployed honey pots to gain information, so no doubt there have been numerous female assassins over millennia, most of which have gone unnamed and unnoticed. In ancient Scythia, teenage girls fought alongside the boys, men and women. They were experts with the recumbent bow and could dispatch a battle-axe toting adversary at 40 yards distance with ease. After their first kill, the Scythians had a ceremony on the battlefield that involved drinking blood from their victim\u2019s skull cap, a ceremony shared by males and females. During the French Revolution, Jean-Paul Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday (see illo). The most famous female assassin in modern times was a Dutch woman named Jeannette, who lived on a houseboat outside Hoorn. Jeannette reportedly charged $100,000 a hit, and did most of her contract work in South America. After she assassinated a Mossad operative, three of his cohorts tracked her down and murdered her in revenge, a scene made famous by the film Munich.  ",
