            "answer_text": "I knew a number of people who met Elton John. When I moved to Atlanta in the early nineties, I started hanging out at Blake\u2019s, the gay bar on 10th Street in the heart of Atlanta\u2019s Midtown area. Elton had recently bought a house nearby, and there were a lot of Elton John sightings in those days. I knew several people who approached him, and found him distant and stand-offish. Some called him a \u201cbitchy queen.\u201d I am a lifelong fan of Elton John, but it should not shock anyone that he has a reputation as difficult, even impossible, and shy around strangers. It still strikes me as odd that Elton came out in public, to a well-lit, crowded bar in a huge gay Mecca nonetheless, then act aloof. But I understand the conflict. I have also been the only sober person in a crowded bar. It becomes boring and annoying fast, and you end up lonely and sulking in the corner. It seems to me he was looking for love. Then he found it. I was dating this guy named Philip, who was friends with David, Elton\u2019s future husband. I do remember meeting David, before he met Elton - going on three decades ago. David was not shy. He seemed to know everyone. Shortly after Elton met David, he and his closest friends formed a tight inner circle. David shed his lesser friendships and became a very private person. I remember that people missed him. During this period, Elton also went to twelve-step meetings in the area. I knew one person who claimed he picked up his chip from Elton. As an anonymous program, there were not many reports about how he acted or what he shared. From what little I remember, Elton went out of his way to be friendly and open with other people in recovery. I also worked with a woman (a sweet, country grandmother with her catering business out in the boondocks) who catered one of his dinners. She said he and his friends were all \u201clovely\u201d to her. From my distant perspective, I gathered Elton lives up to his reputation, as both gracious to his friends and often difficult to handle - and also deeply conflicted. At least at the time. He was a newly sober celebrity, looking for new friends, while wrestling with his inherent shyness. By all accounts, he is a complicated man. My limited experience confirms it. Edit 8/9/19: I did not expect this response to receive much attention, and it is all based on my memories from decades ago. Elton John still owns a condo in the Buckhead area of Atlanta. Here\u2019s an interior snapshot and an update from Buckhead Magazine, dated May, 2016. Does Elton John Really Live In Buckhead?  Exterior shot of Blake\u2019s on the Park, where I should have a bar stool named in my honor. I looked for an interior shot from the nineties, but I think for anonymity reasons, the few online from that time were all dark. It was not dark inside there. It was a well-lit and bustling place (think sports bar) at the time, with two levels, an outdoor deck and several screens.  ",

            "answer_text": "Two people I know have met Elton John. My father, a retired British journalist, met him a few times in the days when Elton John would turn up with no fanfare or publicity to entertain the English soccer team on its travels. John\u2019s repertoire of raunchy songs was, according to my father, second to none. More sadly, a schoolfriend of mine from the time I lived in Paris eventually got into live music production and met Elton John backstage a few times during his drug-fueled days. She told me he wallowed at all times in astonishing luxury but was, as a human being, a sorry and worrying sight to see. \u201cUn naufrage\u201d (a shipwreck) was the word she used. \u201cI shudder when I think of that time,\u201d is how John himself speaks of it today. But that\u2019s the past. I\u2019m pleased to say I saw Elton John in concert in Montreux, Switzerland, in July this year and was, along with some 10\u2019000 other fans, blown away. Sure, his voice isn\u2019t what it used to be, but it\u2019s still powerful, enabling him to deliver more than two hours of great music with his group. \u201cCandle in the wind\u201d had me in tears with John playing alone against a background of massive yet fleeting photos of Marilyn Monroe. Beautiful. The man, his music and his guts in defending what he stands for make me proud to be British.  Elton John being his usual magnificent self in Montreux, Switzerland, 2019 ",
