            "answer_text": "Neither was responsible per se. There was no scientific revolution after Christianity became a sanctioned state religion of the Roman Empire. There was no scientific revolution when Christian feudal states and Christian empires existed for almost a thousand years. On the other hand, atheism clearly had very little to do with it given that the predominate scientists in the world throughout the scientific revolution believed in God and perhaps a significant plurality (if not majority) were Christians in the West. If anything, the scientific revolution was a process begun in the \u201cmiddle ages\u201d through the influences of Islamic civilization during its Golden Age, which brought us the concept of a university with the study of mathematics, Greek philosophy, democracy, medicine, astronomy, and chemistry. Somehow, with the destruction and break down of that civilization (Mongol invasions from the East and Christian crusades from the West), the Islamic society lost much of its edge and Western Europe and then the New World in turn picked up that ball. However, it should be noted that the Christian church at times has opposed and sought to prevent scientific developments that threatened religious dogma, particularly Christian literalist views of creation and the earth being the center of the universe (based on literal interpretations of the Bible). Some Christian sects today and beliefs among the more literalist views serve as retrograde forces with respect to science. The growth in knowledge and science has been the most rapid in the past 200 years. It seems that we have reached some critical mass of knowledge and point of development as a species to rapidly assimilate and develop new understandings. As our material developments have increased, those developments have allowed even greater and more rapid progress in scientific and social knowledge and understanding. I believe that this growth in knowledge was inspired (as did and do many scientists) but is clearly not a Christian development or can be associated with any given Faith. But it also cannot be associated with atheism, although it is true that many scientists and others (seeing the corruptions and contradictions in older, tradition faiths and seeing injustice in the world) are agnostic or atheist at this time.

            "answer_text": "Christianity is indirectly responsible for the scientific revolution. Christian societies became more prosperous than any other. By creating a wealthy society, people could afford the time and resources for higher learning. European schools began as Christian institutions. It could also be argued that Christianity is responsible for atheism. For example, Charles Darwin began his studies with the intent on becoming a Christian minister. His studies eventually led him to discover evolution. That discovery caused allot of people to lean toward atheism. ",
