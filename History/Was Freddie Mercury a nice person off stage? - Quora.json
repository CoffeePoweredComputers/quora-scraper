            "answer_text": "Yes. In person, Freddie was particularly kind and friendly. He loved socializing and fussing over others. Freddie had a large number of friends. Freddie was surprisingly humble and his prideful attitude was more of a stage persona than anything else. Here are a number of examples of his kindness: Tim Staffell was Queen\u2019s original bassist but moved on to a different band due to Queen\u2019s lack of success. The band exploded in popularity years later. Tim said it was impossible to feel resentful because of Freddie\u2019s wonderful personality.At one point during a tour, lead guitarist Brian May became seriously ill with hepatitis and was unable to continue the tour. Brian became worried that he would be replaced, as bassist John Deacon took over as lead guitarist. Freddie visited him frequently in the hospital. He even complied a tape containing Brian\u2019s guitar solos as reassurance that Brian wouldn\u2019t be replaced.Freddie was the peace maker of the band. He settled arguments and made compromises. One time, he valiantly dove between Brian and Roger during an argument to shield Brian from a face full of hair spray.Roger Taylor considered Freddie his best friend. The two loved to joke around. Freddie was the best man at one of Roger\u2019s weddings. Freddie lauded Roger\u2019s drumming as \u201cmore accurate than any drum machine\u201dFreddie was very protective of John Deacon, who only nineteen when he joined. John Deacon is a painfully shy person, so Freddie tried to encourage him to song write and helped him gain confidence as a performer. Freddie put extra effort in recording John\u2019s songs. While recording \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d Freddie sang until his throat bled but refused to stop until the recording was just right.Freddie talked to his mother on the phone at least once a day and always bought her a present while touring.After his producer Reinhold Mack\u2019s wife gave birth, Freddie sent his assistant to buy flowers for the mom and baby. Peter (Phoebe) asked Freddie what her favorite flower was, so Freddie told him to buy her every flower in the store because he didn\u2019t know what kind she liked best.Freddie didn\u2019t want children of his own, but was very kind to the children of people he knew. Mack made him godfather to his son, Freddie John Mack. \u201cBig Freddie\u201d considered the Macks a second family. He played with the Mack children, helped \u201cLittle Freddie\u201d with his homework and wrote him letters. When his ex-fianc\u00e9e Mary gave birth, he bought the baby so many plush toys and gifts that they overflowed out of the nursery.During another occasion, Mary got an earache while the band was recording outside of London. Freddie wanted to stop so he could go home to care for her.When his boyfriend Jim Hutton got a cold, Freddie made such a fuss that Jim described Freddie as \u201ca Jewish mother\u201d in his book.Freddie\u2019s love of cats is legendary, but he was kind to other animals too. While recording the music video for \u201cI\u2019m Going Slightly Mad\u201d live penguins were brought into the studio. The studio was extremely hot, so Freddie spent the time between shoots to offer the birds water to drink. Jim noted at this point Freddie was extremely ill but was more worried about the penguins than himself.Freddie was intolerant of anyone getting emotional around him while ill. The reason why was because he didn\u2019t want anyone to get sad due to his condition.One of Freddie\u2019s main motivations for keeping his AIDS diagnosis secret was he didn\u2019t want his parents, his friends and the children he knew (particular the Macks) to know so not to upset them.According to Jim Hutton, Freddie disclosed his diagnosis to Roger\u2019s ex wife Dominique because she had breast cancer and wanted her to know she wasn\u2019t alone in her health struggles.\u201cFreddie actually gave a lot of money to HIV/AIDS charities anonymously while he was alive, and he also let his doctors try out various new drugs. He knew that the drugs would not give him a longer life span, but hopped that the results of tests done on him would help AIDS sufferers in the future.\u201d - Peter Freestone",
