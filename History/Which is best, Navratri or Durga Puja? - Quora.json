            "answer_text": "For me, it's Durga Puja. Because of the constant fun you have during the festival- you sing, you dance, you go pandal hopping.You are able to adapt many views of the same goddess. BTW, Durga Puja is universal. Navaratri is national. Hindu. Racist.You could eat anything- veg, nonveg. Goddess is offered both milk and fish. That is what we slat Bengal call ambiguity. Not, \u201c\u092c\u0947\u091f\u093e \u0928\u0935\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f \u0939\u0948, \u0928\u094c \u0926\u093f\u0928 nonveg \u091b\u0942\u0928\u093e \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948\u0964\u201d As if goddess is really gonna care what you are eating and what not.Durga Puja has more cjance of finding you a date, in most cases. You know, if Pandals would have a lot of crowd, you'll stick and talk to a bae. But in Navaratri, jealousy could arise in Garba and Dandiya, as the bae could switch to another romantic or flirtarious guy.Fashion is also a factor. You know, boys could wewr anything in pandal hopping- Pajamas, Punjabis or half pants. Girls could wesr anything- Laal Pasha (Red-Bordered Silk) sarees, lehengas, tops, anything. But in Navaratri- only Dhota, Pyjama, Shit and all that bloody bad stuff.So we'll stick to Pujo. No Navaratri.",

            "answer_text": "My friend is a Gujarati, I am a Bengali. For her, Durga Puja is as much a big festival as Navratri is. For me, Navratri time is as much a festive season as Durga Puja time is. We never view the two festivals as separate. Both Navratri & Durga Puja take place almost simultaneously. We too share the joy of this festive season together! For us, the essence of the festival is more important than competing with others. Dandiyas & Dhunuchi Nach interest both of us equally. Let\u2019s not try to be superior than others. Why can\u2019t we just respect the festivals & enjoy them both? ",
