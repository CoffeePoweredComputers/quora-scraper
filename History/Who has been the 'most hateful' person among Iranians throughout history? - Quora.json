            "answer_text": "I believe that there are so many candidates because of our long history which is full of adventures and stories but this one is truly hated by almost every single Iranian and I\u2019m sure that you can\u2019t deny how hateful this guy is! This person is alive still alive! the guy is an old Islamist! No! not a mullah! she is a woman, not a man! she is living in France right now! Can you guess the name? No problem if you have no idea, just Scroll down to find the answer . . . . . . . . . . . She is called Maryam Rajavi but her real name is Maryam Qajar Ozdanlo :  Probably you think: How can this beautiful lady be accused of any crime? But don\u2019t let this misleading face distract you from the truth Maryam Rajavi is the current leader of MEK (an Iranian political-militant organization which was created by leftist Islamists activists). She is Masoud Rajavi\u2019s wife. Masoud Rajavi was the previous leader of the MEK, we have not heard from Masoud Rajavi for a long time, probably he died several years ago. The symbol of the People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran\u201d  They have a bloody history which is full of blood and betrayal, betrayal to their motherland and nation. No matter if you support I.R or not, no matter if you are a monarchist or republican, no matter you are a Persian or Kurd, you have enough reasons to hate them. MEK and its thugs are most hated among Iranian I try to show you some reasons and mention some wickedness that they committed however they may be countless! During the 1979 revolution when revolutionists Overthrew the Shah, Khomeini betrayed other groups participating in the revolution and took full power alone so MEK started rebelling against their former allies but their actions were crazy, do you remember mad king in GOT? They assassinated 17,000 civilians Iranian, many of the victims were children and women. Many of them were killed brutally in dreadful ways and some were killed under brutal tortures. They also exploded many handmade bombs in different cities of Iran and caused huge casualties. In 1980 they transferred to Iraq when Iran was in the middle of a bloody war against Saddam Hussein. After a while, they performed several operations against Iran however they couldn\u2019t achieve any notable success. **Honestly I couldn't share more pictures about crimes against their victims but you can find horrible pics on the internet**  burying alive a Kurd child by a MEK member Good luck!

            "answer_text": "Several of the answers here I believe are incorrect, because the question is not asking who was the most hateful against Iranians but rather who was the most hateful among Iranians i.e- which Iranian has been the most hateful throughout Iranian history. The first person that came to mind was Davud Monshizadeh:  He was an Iranian Neo-Nazi who fought in the the SS during the Battle of Berlin. Prior to that he was a member of the NSDAP. After the war ended, he created SUMKA, an Iranian Neo-Nazi party that expressed extreme hatred against Arabs and Jews. The party never gained serious power though it was still terrifying in the sense that it almost a complete copy of the NSDAP\u2019s beliefs.  There is no evidence to suggest that he took part in the holocaust, though he is certainly one of Iran\u2019s worst citizens. \u2014Further reading:\u2014 Davud Monshizadeh - Wikipedia SUMKA - Wikipedia ",
