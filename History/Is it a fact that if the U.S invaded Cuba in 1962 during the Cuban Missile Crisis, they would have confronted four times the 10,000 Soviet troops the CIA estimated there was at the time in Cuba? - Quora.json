            "answer_text": "No it is not true. What the US invasion would have faced is a Soviet ground force what was already equipped with battlefield tactical nuclear weapons to be used in the defense of the medium and intermediate range nuclear armed missiles that the Soviet Union had installed in Cuba. 30+ plus years after the crisis and the end of the Cold War, Russian, Cuban, and American diplomats, soldiers, and historians met to fully discuss the crisis for the purposes of lessons learned. And the creation of a comprehensive historical record of the cold war confrontation. Unknown (in the West) until that time (the early 1990s), was the fact that the Soviet Union\u2019s deployment of medium and intermediate range nuclear armed missiles to Cuba. Was not a impulsive, or ad hoc gesture of support, for an emerging communist ally of the Soviet Union. It was also most emphatically, not an impulsive gesture which the US, \u201ccaught just in time\u201d, to allegedly, just avoid disaster. The Soviet Union sent 40+ thousand ground, air, and air defense forces to Cuba, before, and concurrent with, the deployment of medium and intermediate range nuclear armed missiles, to Cuba. Unknown to the US at the time, was the fact that the ground force was both experienced and well trained, in the defense of such semi-mobile missile installations. From similar deployments in Central and Eastern Europe, both in the Western Soviet Union, and in the territories of its Warsaw Pact allies. That training and experience was with battlefield tactical nuclear weapons; that they had been trained to use in defense of the nuclear armed medium and intermediate range missiles that were deployed, in the Western Soviet Union, and within the territories of Warsaw Pact allies. In short, a US invasion of Cuba seeking to overrun and neutralize the Soviet\u2019s Cuba deployed semi-mobile missile bases. Would have been attacked by the Soviets in their defense against the American invasion, with battlefield nuclear weapons. Firing on the American invasion force. And contained fully within the territory of Cuba. From the history of that time it is recalled that President Kennedy declared (in public before the world, on television and radio), that as President and Commander-in-Chief of US Armed forces, he would regard an attack upon any other country in the Caribbean Basin, or the Western Hemisphere, by or from Cuba, to be regarded as; \u201c\u2026an attack by the Soviet Union upon the United States; requiring a retaliatory response by the United States\u2026\u201d Note: The Soviet Armed Forces\u2019 use of battlefield nuclear weapons on the beaches (of Cuba) or less than 12 statute miles from the shoreline of Cuba (measured from low tide), would not meet President Kennedy\u2019s publicly announced criteria, for a precipitate attack upon the Soviet Union, by the United States. As the very criteria that Kennedy had publicly stated, for such an attack. Would not appertain to the situation that the Soviets were capable of achieving. If the US had, executed an attempted invasion. Examined from the vantage point of nearly 60 years, it is clear that neither Kennedy, his Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, or the Joint Chiefs, had the slightest notion of the situation that they were walking the country into. ",
