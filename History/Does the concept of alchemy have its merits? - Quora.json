            "answer_text": "\u2018Alchemy\u2019 was a huge range of practices but its most notorious and ridiculed effort involved the attempt to convert base metals to gold. We\u2019re talking about the first laboratory experiments in the Western world, starting over a thousand years ago. At that time the church was the central source of intellectual advances and it was concerned mostly with ethical, astronomical, mathematical, and metaphysical thought. Important to realize that this was the first great intellectual advance since the time of the Greek culture. The Roman culture obviously concentrated upon ethics (in the Christian focus of monotheism) architecture, the arts of government, warfare and administration (as we would call it) and had made massive contributions in those areas. The Roman stuff came to be understood as the advance of practical reason, an obvious mistake when one considers the contributions of the evolving Christian culture which was to dominate the next period right up to the Renaissance. That period which one can consider as busting open in the 14th century only after the long period of advances attempting to digest the philosophy associated with Christian metaphysics and ethics. Alchemists understood correctly that there must be a way to convert substances from one to another. Brass to gold and similar conversions were the test cases which, at the time, challenged Aristotle's theories of matter and essences. Opening that discussion was a gigantic achievement. Now, granted, success in that was not delivered until the 20th century after the development of chemistry and nuclear physics, but a normal period of work for a major advance, and it opened an enormous and worthy intellectual challenge. A parallel case would be the effort to bleach out secular ethics from Christian teachings in the New Testament. Your question reminds us of the achievements of the period. which followed that of the Romans - as Rome \u2018declined\u2019. Well asked. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what you think the \u201cconcept of alchemy\u201d is. The traditional goal of alchemy was to discover how to perfect materials. And perfected metal was gold, and perfected flesh was young and healthy, hence the two famous goals of creating gold from lead and finding the elixir of life. In a generalized way, you could say those two goals live on, though with a completely different understanding of the material world. All human cultures, everywhere, have sought to keep people healthy, and that continues. The alchemical way of seeking that goal, we now see, was bound to fail. Actually creating gold by chemical processes is likewise bound to fail\u2014and creating it by nuclear processes is far more expensive than the gold is worth\u2014but if you take \u201cperfecting materials\u201d to mean \u201cmaking materials have the properties we want,\u201d then that\u2019s what modern chemical technology is all about. For the rest, while alchemists were pursuing these two hopeless goals, they learned a lot about about lab technique and the vocabulary needed to describe chemical activity. ",
