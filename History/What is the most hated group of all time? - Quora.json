            "answer_text": "I am surprised that no one is talking about money lenders. History is quite clear that money lenders have been the most contentious group in all of history. As far back as Babylon there was a fear of money lenders because of their power to overthrow monarchies, to fuel war, to drive slavery through people selling themselves and their families to the money lenders or the state/temple for defaulted loans or unpaid taxes due to defaulted loans. This is because of the criminal nature of charging interest on abstract forms of money. Usury is a derivation of the Latin word for interest usura. \u201cORIGIN OF THE WORD FOR INTEREST What gave the ancient Sumerians the idea of charging one another interest? Linguistic evidence provides a clue. In the Sumerian language, the word for interest, mash, was also the term for calves. In ancient Greek, the word for interest, tokos, also refers to the offspring of cattle. The Latin term pecus, or flock, is the root of our word \u201cpecuniary.\u201d The Egyptian word for interest, like the Sumerian word, is ms, and means \u201cto give birth.\u201d All these terms point to the derivation of interest rates from the natural multiplication of livestock. If you lend someone a herd of thirty cattle for one year, you expect to be repaid with more than thirty cattle. The herd multiplies\u2014the herder\u2019s wealth has a natural rate of increase equal to the rate of reproduction of the livestock. If cattle were the standard currency, then loans in all comparable commodities would be expected to \u201cgive birth\u201d as well. The idea of interest seems to be a natural one for an agricultural or pastoral society, but not so for hunter-gatherers. Ancient Sumerian society\u2014in particular, Uruk, sometimes referred to as \u201cthe city of sheepfolds\u201d\u2014would have been the perfect setting for the evolution of the practice of lending money at interest.\u201d William N. Goetzmann. \u201cMoney Changes Everything: How Finance Made Civilization Possible.\u201d Keep in mind here that money lenders have never created the currency to pay the interest with, the currency itself was expected to grow and reproduce biologically under the direct care of the borrower. Interest is literally the concept of giving birth to new life, or new currency. From Aristotle to the time period revolving around the discovery of America intellectual, legal, and philosophical battles were fought over these issues which often led to wars. Aristotle pointed out that abstract currencies have no intrinsic qualities except as being a medium of exchange. The abstract currency has no means of self replication, which makes expecting interest payments on abstract currencies illogical and immoral and a useless practice. \u201cGod, nature, reason, all scripture, all law, all authors, all doctors, yea all councils are against usury. Philosophers, Greeks, Latins, Lawyers, Divines, Catholics, Heretics, all tongues, all nations, have thought usury as bad as a thief. \u2014Roger Fenton, 1612\u201d We don't have enough content from before Ancient Greece on the ideas of interest in popular writings, but most every major and many minor religious texts and ancient legal codes tries to control usury(interest) because of its destructive nature. This is nowhere more clear than Charlemenge\u2019s complete ban of both secular and ecclesiastical practices of charging interest to represent this point. These laws drove the issues of the Middle Ages, helped give rise to the power of the Knights Templar and other groups who sought work around to the laws, solidified in the minds of Middle Ages Europeans that Jews were evil and untrustworthy money lenders since they were the only group that was permitted to lend money at interest (of note Jews were not allowed to charge each other interest because of its destructive power, but non-Jewish Gentiles were fair targets). Leviticus 25:36 Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you. This page shows that there are many references in the Old Testament that clearly states that Jews were only to consider these ideas of not charging interest when dealing with countrymen, also described as brothers, which clearly describes fellow Jews. This is because the charging of interest on abstract currencies is a criminal act and through the voice of the Jewish concept of God these narratives show these concepts quite well, specifically highlighting the fact that if they want their brothers to succeed they cannot lend money at interest. Yet, there are no stipulations against foreigners or Gentiles concerning interest. This is most likely due to the evidence that historically interest, especially the abusive application of compound interest, was used as a disciplinary action to weaken an enemy. The Enmetena cone dated to 2400 BCE is the first known example of the use of compound interest being leveraged as war reparations by Enmetena after the conquest of Lagash. \u201cEarly loan contracts demonstrate that, admonitions aside, lending at usury occurred despite the warnings of the prophets. Interest was set at 12 percent among the Hebrews. A similar rate structure was found in many ancient cultures. When Nehemiah was the provincial governor of Judea between 444 and 432 B.C., he declared the 12 percent rate to be used to settle disputes, a practice that would endure for over two thousand years. A similar admonition can be found in Psalms. \u201cHe that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved\u201d (25:5). These statements, especially the one concerning lending to members of one\u2019s own tribe, were perhaps the earliest foundation of a cottage industry that would be known throughout the ancient and medieval worlds. In order to conform to Deuteronomy, Jews could only lend to gentiles and a tradition began that survived for centuries. They became associated with lending and suffered both the fruits and the consequences of their activity. As they later discovered, rulers in Europe often required their services desperately but often cited church law forbidding usury when it was time to repay. Citing religion was a powerful reason for not repaying a loan since secular law traditionally did not condemn usury.\u201d Charles R. Geisst. \u201cBeggar Thy Neighbor.\u201d With the intellectual growth of the Renaissance and Lutheran Reformation and other religious changes the money lenders began to win the arguments and various tools were allowed to be developed that brought interest back into popular use, and eventually returned it to full legality. Some tools used during strict usury prohibition was to hide interest with fees, like charging for currency exchanges when trading across borders. \u201cAfter the discovery of America, capital was in demand, and men were ready to pay interest on it. Then the theologians were obliged to review their teachings. If it had come to this, that money must be had, and men would pay interest on it, ecclesiastical ethics must be revised. \u2014Richard Henry Dana, 1867\u201d The desire for money lenders to earn easy profits from the poor and from the rich alike has been universally hated by all races of men and all countries and all religions throughout history. However, as America grew into an independent nation and internatnal commerce expanded and the churches stopped preaching the criminal nature of interest, the textbooks stopped talking about it. The politicians and clergymen who wanted to limit interest were pushed aside and largely ignored, because the flood gates were being opened and a feeding frenzy was to begin. To try and stop the rise of power of the bankers and the increased use of interest to control the public and nations alike interest ceilings were put into place. However, these only lasted until the middle 19th century when pressure from the bankers finally dissolved the debt ceilings and interest was allowed to rise to any level the bankers wished to use. Laws have moved back and forth since then, capping interest and raising the caps. Where banks couldn't overcome legislation they used assassinations, bribery, and many other tricks to destabilize governments. When that wasn't expedient the banks would just move their headquarters to new jurisdictions. Groups like the Mafia and other criminal organizations lend money at rates up to 1000% or more, because of its disciplinary power and the ease with which money lending can be used to turn a profit. In the 1980\u2019s Chase Manhattan Bank moved their credit card issuing banks out of New York because of the usury laws there. The banks were moved to areas where credit cards could be issued with higher interest rates. Greece and much of Europe is suffering from the interest charged on loans from the IMF. It's a global issue, and the hatred of money lenders is on the rise again. The use of mass media largely owned by the bankers is working hard to sell the nonsense ideas of trickle down economics and to disregard conspiracy theories, especially those that focus on the bankers working together for control of the world. Of note is the evidence that the American Revolution was begun because of Central banks, specifically the Bank of England, lending money to kings at high interest. The taxes levied against the people, specifically the taxes levied against the colonies, were used as collateral against the loans from the Bank of England. To borrow more money to fight the wars taking place in the late 1700\u2019s King George III needed more cash flow to feed the banks with. These issues were why private central banks were hated by many of the founding fathers. The federal reserve is a perfect example of the power of money lenders, and as the secrets of banking are becoming known by the masses again, a deep and ancient hatred for money lenders is growing again. I could take more time and write a much more detailed article about why I see money lenders as the most hated group in all of history, but I think I've made my case. Edit: other more complicated reasons that money lenders are hated include fractional reserve lending, the creation of money out of nothing at the time of the loan, and banks destroying independent and sovereign economies that refuse to participate in their criminal banking schemes. Perhaps when I have time I can discuss these issues as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Funny how most answers are about race and religion despite the author hinting that it\u2019s not only about that. The answer is really in plain sight, although I\u2019m pretty sure there will be a lot of arguing in the comments. (Advance warning: I will reply to the reasonable ones but delete the dumb ones.) Not the Jews. Chunks of mankind larger than Europe like most of Asia and Africa (except the Middle East) never cared or discriminated against the Jews, and the animosity in the Middle East is also relatively new. Even in large chunks of Europe (like Russia) the hatred is only 2\u20133 hundred years old. Obviously, the pre-Columbian America didn\u2019t even know who the Jews were, and the post-Columbian America, with occasional bursts of antisemitism, had other favourite scapegoats. Not the Muslims. Indeed, the frictions both in Asia and Europe have been happening for hundreds of years, but the mankind is older than that. Not the Roma. Again, they are hardly known outside of Europe, and even in Europe are relatively new. Not the Blacks. Today, most of the mankind views Africans and Blacks as victims, and there was little interaction between African countries and the rest of the world throughout most of the history. Not the white people, the tax authorities, the dentists, the police, or the military. I nominate: the rich. (The question is NOT about persecution, is it?) If there is one group that has been consistently hated since time immemorial, it\u2019s the rich. It\u2019s not even the criminals, as crime is often glamourised. The rich, on the other hand\u2026 I have difficulties imagining a respectable ancient Egyptian talking to his neighbour about some weirdly-accented people plotting against the pharaoh in order to take over Egypt and Mesopotamia. I have no difficulties seeing how the same Egyptian hates his neighbour because the neighbour has a larger house or twice as much cattle. It is not about the rich who have gotten their wealth in bad, dishonest ways. It\u2019s about the rich being rich, period. Great social progress has been made over the last hundreds of years. Very few people will admit being racists; it is a swearword even in the most backward of societies (including those that practice racism). Being homophobic is frowned upon in most developed countries and it\u2019s only a matter of decades until the rest of the world will adopt the same attitude. Bigots have to hide their bigotry, and while much of it is still at large, it is generally not OK to display it publicly. It is still OK to hate and display prejudice toward the rich though. Otherwise reasonable people still believe that the world is controlled by a handful of rich families who, somehow, spend every waking moment of their lives thinking how to make it worse for the rest of the world. Pop culture is a great reflection of public perception; if you have two characters, one rich, the other poor, who is the hero, and who is the antagonist? Or, consider a movie like Society.  In a thinly veiled social commentary, the film depicts the elites as a different species, sucking the nutrients from the poor. It is not about the dishonest rich, or the war profiteers, or the real estate speculators; just the rich in general. And while no longer a unanimous opinion, it is still largely a consensus in divided societies like the US. Just like any other type of prejudice and scapegoating, it is easily exploited by power-hungry demagogues, from Bolsheviks in early XX century Russia to the latest crop of populist Western politicians (some of whom, paradoxically, may be billionaires; mob mentality is not about logic). Run a search in Google, \u201crich are other people\u201d and see the results. Now substitute \u201crich\u201d by \u201cJews\u201d / \u201cMuslims\u201d / \u201cAmericans\u201d / \u201cRussians\u201d / \u201chomosexuals\u201d. See the picture? Or they deserve it because they are rich? In a famed \u201cexchange\u201d between F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, Fitzgerald is quoted as saying, \u201cThe rich are different from you and me\u201d, to which Hemingway replies, \u201cYes, they have more money.\u201d (As the linked article explains, Hemingway was merely quoting someone else.) Throughout the history, most people would agree with Fitzgerald. ",
