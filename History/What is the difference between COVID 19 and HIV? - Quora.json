I notice that the experts don't usually answer this question when it is asked on TV. Nobody is going there and I came across it in the early days of Covid-19 when there was a lot of speculation about the virus. There were some similarities in that it usually finally killed because of a weak immune system. and this: Does the new coronavirus contain HIV? No. An analysis of the genetic code of the virus shows small similarities with HIV, but that is not surprising: \"the hereditary code of the virus has about as many letters as a weekday newspaper,\" this article (Dutch) compares. \"Not surprising, then, if by chance, there are a few words that are already in another newspaper.\" Answers on COVID-19 and HIV (medication) Not surprising then, if by chance, there are a few words that are already in another newspaper: Google translate to read, \u201ca few words\u201d in another newspaper: \u2018Bangmakende pseudowetenschap\u2019 zaait paniek: wat doen die stukjes hiv in het nieuwe Wuhanvirus? Is Covid-19, 2 viruses in 1? The best here is to compare how these viruses infect the host. Are they really working in exactly the same way? We know how Covid-19 works: It binds with the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor site. Once it enters the host cell it replicates and increases in numbers. The cell releases the newly created viruses into the extracellular fluids and they invade new cells and replicate again, and the virus increases in numbers in the body. It is interesting to see how the process of the virus replicating inside the body is about the same as the exponential process of the people outside are who are being infected. As it is inside so it is as outside. Nature seems simple in the way it goes about things. The receptors for Covid-19 are present in the body here, here and here: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines. ACE2 lowers blood pressure by catalysing the cleavage of angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor peptide) into angiotensin 1\u20137 (a vasodilator). ACE2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses. The cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines is where the ACE2 enzyme binds and ACE2 is where the Covid-19 virus binds. Hence the ACE2 enzyme carries the Covid-19 virus wherever it goes. ACE2 is part of the blood pressure monitoring system pathway in the body as shown below.  Takes the virus into the cell:  The function of ACE2 is to create Angiotensin 1-7 where \" ACE2 has been shown to have a protective effect against virus-induced lung injury by increasing the production of the vasodilator angiotensin 1\u20137 \" So when Covid-19 docks on the ACE2 enzyme it reduces the amount of the enzyme in the cells and hence this reduces the protection for the lungs. This is also a possible reason why there is so much damage to the lungs in the presence of Covid-19 in the body. It weakens the defence in the lungs and then starts to replicate in its cells and then steps back and watches a weak immune system try and protect the lungs which it cannot do. It goes into overdrive in confusion while fighting back the replicating virus numbers and floods the lungs and deprives it of oxygen. So what does the HIV virus do to the body? You would expect it to be the same but is it. HIV is a virus so it does the same thing. It needs a docking receptor site. It needs to replicate in numbers and it confuses the hell out of the immune system by doubling in numbers. A weak immune system won't cope and the host pays the price. This is also possibly how people die of the flu every year. HIV has an interesting docking site in the body. It is in the immune system itself. I am almost sure these viruses have a mind of its own if not how can it design itself so well to do its job. \"The cells of the immune system can be categorized as lymphocytes (T-cells, B-cells and NK cells), neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages. These are all types of white blood cells.\" The binding site in the host is called the CD4 receptors. They are present in the T4 cells of the immune system. The HIV virus is right from the start into the immune system. What do these T4 cells do: \"...their main roles is to send signals to other types of immune cells, including CD8 killer cells, which then destroy the infectious particle.\" and, \"They also release chemicals, known as cytokines, which control the entire immune response\" So here is a HIV virus binding to a T4 cell membrane via the CD4 receptor site. This T4 cell releases chemicals known as cytokines which control the entire immune system and the HIV virus is right in there playing the rogue right in the centre of government. It looks very much like a coup to me.  Just like when the Covid-19 virus docks in the ACE2 enzyme it reduces its numbers and hence reduces the protection to the lungs and so does the HIV virus when it binds with the T4 command cell it reduces its numbers and therefore stops it from signalling its comrades to protect the host. So you can see here that Covid-19 and HIV are 2 different viruses working differently on various receptor sites in the body but they are doing the same thing - they are making the immune system to step back in the process of replicating themselves while they bring on a coup on the body and kill it if they have to and that is just what happens when countries go to war to protect themselves. This is what viruses Covid-19 and the HIV do and they are designed to do it differently and that does not mean they are the same, but there is something uncanny about them that they feel the same. This is speculation of course and what else can I say as there are similarities between the 2 viruses in how they finally deal with the host by an immune system overload which then kills them. But Covid-19 and HIV virus do act off different receptor sites and part of different pathways in the body: Covid-19 off the Blood Pressure control mechanism and HIV virus on the T4 cells of the immune system which release cytokines a chemical which controls the immune response and yet both of them kill by a cytokine overload. So you can see here that Covid-19 is acting like it is HIV. So if you are the curious type you would want to look at the Covid-19 virus and see if there are any HIV aspects in its molecule.

Image BioArxiv  Abstract We are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity /similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature. This work provides yet unknown insights on 2019-nCoV and sheds light on the evolution and pathogenicity of this virus with important implications for diagnosis of this virus. Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag The above article has been removed but with caveats but the website was given permission by the authors to keep it in print. So if there are HIV aspects to the Covid-19 virus be them only in parts yet: \"despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site.\" which means the Covid-19 virus can still behave like a HIV virus and attach itself to the CD4 binding site of the T4 cells of the immune system and bring on the Cytokine overload to kill off the host. I think Covid-19 acts in 2 ways. This is 2 viruses in 1. If fact it might look like it is the Covid-19 virus which is doing all the work which is killing the host. But I think, Covid-19 as we know it, is more of the infectious part of the virus which deals with resilence outside the host and easy infectious transmissions and some weakening of the immune system, but it is the HIV part in Covid-19 which finally generates the cytokine overload and kills the host. This does not mean that Covid-19 is HIV. HIV has a long-acting presence in the body which science cannot seem to get rid off. Let's hope that for Covid-19 when it has done its thing to the host and the symptoms are over so also is the virus gone forever. If it still lingers on in our bodies after the antibodies are produced then seriously we have to call Covid-19 a fast-acting easily transmitted HIV virus. I think if Covid-19 did not have this HIV component to it then it would have been just another flu virus. It is going to continue to disrupt economies around the world as they try and control this virus. You know giant leaps of innovation might not be possible in the human mind as it always correlates with its past in mind and what is already knowns but in the natural world it has no such limitations and the Covid-19 virus could be considered a giant leap innovation in the natural world. Ironic isn't it a virus 2 in 1 is creating a world of many to become 1. But some countries fight back by creating better weapons and so today the World Health Organisation has announced that they are trying new drug trials: WHO announces \u201chistoric\u201d coronavirus drug trial  Here they also have had some trials in New York City on a drug called Leronlimad: March 28, 2020 \"Doctors right now don\u2019t know quite how leronlimab works, but studies suggest it calms the overly aggressive immune response \u2014 known as a cytokine storm \u2014 that frequently leads to lung inflammation, pneumonia and potentially death.\" Coronavirus patients were taken off ventilators after getting experimental HIV drug ",
