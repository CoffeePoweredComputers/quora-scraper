            "answer_text": "The number of people who lived between 50,000 BC and AD 2011 has been guesstimated at 107,602,707,791 by demographer Carl Haub (see Haub\u2019s article How Many People Have Ever Lived on Earth?, and Wesley Stephenson, Do the dead outnumber the living? - BBC News). The number of people alive in 2011 was 6,987,000,000 according to Haub, so the balance of ca. 100,615,707,791 (100.6 billion) had died. Despite all its horrors, conventional warfare ranks comparatively low, in quantitative terms, as a cause of human suffering and death. According to \u00abThe Great \"War Figures\" Hoax: an investigation in polemomythology\u00bb by B. Jongman & J.M.G. van der Dennen, it has been claimed that since 3600 B.C. there have been 14,531 wars, large and small, in which 3,640,000,000 people were killed. However, one of the proponents of this estimate, \"perhaps feeling that the war casualties figure was improbably high\", has changed \"approximately 3,640,000,000 human beings have been killed by war or the diseases produced by war\" to \"approximately 1,240,000,000 human beings...&c.\". The lower figure is more plausible, see my article Germs vs. guns, or death from mass violence in perspective. Primitive warfare is estimated to have accounted for 15.1 % of deaths and claimed 400 million victims, see Matthew White, \"Primitive War\" (Historical Body Count p.2). Added to the previous figure of 1,240 million this would mean a total of 1,640,000,000 people killed by war (including deaths from famine and disease caused by war) throughout the history and prehistory of mankind. This is less than the number of deaths from infectious diseases in the 20th Century alone. And even the 1.64 billion estimate may be on the high side, considering that the violent events listed by Matthew White as \"humanity\u2019s 100 deadliest achievements\" caused less than 0.5 billion deaths in total (see my answer to the question What was/is the most violent century recorded in history?). Moreover famine and disease brought on or intensified by war were the main cause of war deaths throughout history (see my answer to the question How many people died from disease in war?). Assuming that 1.64 billion out of 100.6 billion deaths were caused by wars (including famine and disease brought on or intensified by wars), wars accounted for about 1.6 % of all deaths between 50,000 BC and AD 2011. The number of war deaths from hard violence, about 0.46 billion, would be just about 0.46% of all human deaths between 50,000 BC and AD 2011. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite few, actually. Let\u2019s take the largest, most destructive war in human history: WW2. By pretty much all estimates, the global population lost about 70 million people over a 9-year period (if one includes the 2nd Sino-Japanese war as a \u201crunner up\u201d to WW2). This is from a a global population of 2.3 BILLION in 1940. That\u2019s a 3% death rate. Even the most exsanguinary wars (such as the 30 Years War, or some of the Mongol conquests) never killed more than 8\u201310% of the population in a large area. And those kinds of wars are extremely rare. Overall, given that epidemic disease is by far the largest killer of human beings throughout history (estimates of 60\u201375% of all human deaths being caused by an epidemic disease with most of the rest being infections), warfare is tiny and rare. For comparison, significantly more people died from the Influenza of 1918\u201320 than died in World War One. Wikipedia (List of wars by death toll) estimates that about two-thirds of a billion human beings have died in recorded history (about 10,000 years). In that time frame, a bit over 100 billion people have lived. So that means maybe 0.65% of them died due to warfare. ",
