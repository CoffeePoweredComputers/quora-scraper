            "answer_text": "I am thoroughly entertained by the prospect of such a question and any possible subtext, a comparison between a pre-Quranic Greek-Macedonian figure facing off an Ottoman sultan known as the lawgiver and the magnificent. Almost as if the \u201cfate\u201d anime series could use another episode, to see which historical figure would be \u201cgreater\u201d. I would like to thank the individual who asked this question. Alexander the Great according to traditional Quran commentators is identified as Dhu al-Qarnayn, (Arabic: \u0630\u064f\u0648 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u200e \u1e0e\u016b al-Qarnayn, Lit.: \"He of the Two Horns\"), the famed one who travelled east and west and erected a wall between mankind and Gog and Magog, in a chapter of the Quran known as \u201cthe cave\u201d (al kahf) famous for several narrations that have a mystical element. Also recited by Muslims on Fridays as a protection against the anti-Christ, with the sura being a source of immense \u201clight\u201d, a shield so to speak. Writing this answer at a time when people are isolating themselves in their own \u201ccave\u201d against the tribulations of COVID-19, but that is me going on a bit of a tangent. \u201cThe cave\u201d also contains a story about Moses and Khidr (the green one, St. George for the English), meeting one another where the \u201ctwo seas meet\u201d, which carries geographic and mystical significance, a place where the boundaries of material and spiritual realms briefly meet. Khidr is shown to repeatedly break the rules of the \u201cSharia\u201d (the law) of Moses working in strange ways only to show Moses the mystical significance of his actions, after Moses loses his patience \u2014 three times \u2014 all this in the Quran. Yes, Kahf is where fundamentalist beliefs come to die, and the mystics, the gnostics of the ages, the truth seekers, are given a mischevous heavenly nod. All the figures praised in Kahf are pre-Islamic, with their identified regions as potentially being the Levant (Amman, Jordan), Turkey (Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea), Armenia and possibly the Caucasus Mountain region which stretches between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, some speculate even further East with the Great Wall of China, but I think not. While there are some commentators who identify Cyrus the Great as Dhu al-Qarnayn, because of possible \u201clater additions\u201d to the tale of Alexander that do not fit the Quranic mold, one cannot answer this question without taking a side, and I side with the traditional commentators with Alexander as the famed \u201cDhul al-Qarnyan\u201d, sorry Cyrus. Speaking of Cyrus in an age where Evangelicals seek to associate Trump as the next Cyrus, that is where Suleiman the Magnificent comes into the picture. It was he who gave the Jews an upgraded wailing wall (Buraq wall) in Jerusalem (Caliph Omar permitted Jews to re-enter Jerusalem) and commissioned Sinan to work on it, while renovating Masjid Aqsa, it was he who was known as the lawgiver to the Ottomans. It was he who stopped the practice of fratricide between brothers to determine the next Sultan. For all of his works, in his old age, I am sure he would have loved even for a brief moment to be referred to as the \u201cDhu al-Qarnayn\u201d, to be praised by Allah himself, and not the one who fell to the whims of his controversial consort turned Queen Roxelana, killing Ibrahim his trusted advisor and his eldest son between palace intrigue. From Kahf: \u2026till he reached the place of the rising sun. He found it rising over a people for whom We had not made any shelter from it. Thus [it was], and We encompassed that which lay before him in awareness. Then he followed a means, till he reached the place between the two mountain barriers. He found beyond them a people who could scarcely comprehend speech. They said, \u201cO Dhu\u2019l-Qarnayn! Truly Gog and Magog are workers of corruption in the land. Shall we assign thee a tribute, that thou mightest set a barrier between them and us?\u201d He said, \u201cThat wherewith my Lord has established me is better; so aid me with strength. I shall set a rampart between you and them. Bring me pieces of iron.\u201d Then, when he had leveled the two cliffs, he said, \u201cBlow!\u201d till when he had made it fire, he said, \u201cBring me molten copper to pour over it.\u201d Thus they were not able to surmount it, nor could they pierce it. He said, \u201cThis is a mercy from my Lord. And when the Promise of my Lord comes, He will crumble it to dust. And the Promise of my Lord is true.\u201d (Quran: Surah Kahf 18:90\u201398) Unlike the Book of Revelations which places Greek-Roman society in a bad light, the Quran grants victory to the Romans over the Persians (Surah Rum), and elevates the Greek-Macedonian figure by having him seal off the \u201chordes\u201d (Surah Kahf) for a later time. Extent of Alexander the Great and Suleiman the Magnificent\u2019s domains, respectively:   Suffice to say, I think it is safe to say, the reader knows my answer by now on who is \u201cgreater\u201d between the two.

            "answer_text": "There's a huge difference Alexander the great actually only conquered the Persian achaememnid empire and the rest was only some tribes And suleiman just conquered some weak nations. What he is known for is the reforming policy in the empire. Like schools and religion. But in my opinion and I'm turk Alexander was \u201cgreater\u201dbecause he was an inspiration for so many others to conquer places. Just goggle : why alexander was the single most important person in history. ",
