            "answer_text": "For my money, the best overall Queen of the six was Catherine Parr. Incredibly intelligent, learned, compassionate. She ruled as regent when he was away on campaign (as Catherine of Aragon did as well) and was very well regarded when she did so. She was an excellent step-mother not just to her Henry\u2019s kids but to the children of previous husbands. She reconciled the family. So much of the resulting history is because of Parr. That Elizabeth and Edward were both Protestant is partially due to her role in their education (Edward\u2019s uncles were also staunchly protestant and Elizabeth\u2019s household, some installed by her mother, were also protestant leaning so it wasn\u2019t all Parr but she certainly had a lot of influence.) That Elizabeth and Mary were both restored to the succession was partially due to her intercession. That Elizabeth was so well educated was partially due to her (and that had impact on the type of court she cultivated, courtiers she attracted, which impacted who those courtiers were patrons to.) I know she\u2019s had a bit of a resurgence but I think her role in English history is still pretty understated. But, while she was a great Queen, there are reasons she wasn\u2019t always the best for Henry. First, she definitely did not love him. She was in love with Thomas Seymour. While she was certainly faithful, she wasn\u2019t all about Henry the way Catherine of Aragon was. Henry hated how she would preach at him about her protestant views and almost had her arrested for it. The arrest warrant had been drafted and signed! This was not a picture perfect marriage. While he was alive, she was an excellent step-mother to all his children (even Mary who wasn\u2019t far from her in age!) Not necessarily the perfect wife. But the best Queen to Henry was Catherine of Aragon who was devoted and loved him. She did the embroidery on his clothing herself and continued to do so after he had abandoned her. But she was also willing to stand up to him and push back, which he needed. He loved her very much for most of their marriage. And it was really the most stable relationship he had. If we asked Henry he\u2019d say Jane for giving him a son. But if we could ask him we could also tell him that son died young and his big concern came to pass with his two daughters ruling. That might change his opinion. He loved Jane for what she did. He loved Catherine of Aragon for who she was. ",

            "answer_text": "They were all \u201cthe best.\u201d Each woman had her own strengths and talents. Each woman had her own stamp to put on the role, and her own ambitions. Katharine of Aragon was brilliant, pious, and had a will of absolute iron. She believed it was her destiny to be Queen of England and refused to give up that title simply because her husband wanted to take another wife in her place. She could have lived a life of comfort and ease if she\u2019d accepted Henry\u2019s offer and given him his annulment, but she refused to give in because it would have also meant surrendering her daughter\u2019s claim to the throne. She was also likely the only one of Henry\u2019s queens who ever loved him. Anne Boleyn, also brilliant and pious, was stalked and harassed by Henry for several years until he presented her with an offer she literally couldn\u2019t refuse \u2014 to become his wife as soon as he\u2019d secured an annulment from his first. Anne, a deeply religious woman, began to see the hand of God in all of this. Perhaps he was working through the king\u2019s desire to make Anne queen so she could reform the church. And, while he was pursuing her, Henry listened attentively to Anne\u2019s ideas about church reform. He especially liked the idea that kings, not the pope, should be head of the church in their countries because it gave him more power. He even agreed to her idea of using the money from the dissolved monasteries to found schools so the English people would be able to read the Bible that Anne wanted to have translated into English. (As it turned out, he decided to keep those coins jingling in his own pocket, and was horrified that the English Bible led to the common folk reading it and coming to their own conclusions about religious matters instead of accepting the interpretation his church decreed.) Anne slowly lost her power over church reform as Henry\u2019s eyes drifted to his next wife. Jane Seymour was extremely skilled at acting. Her co-conspirators tutored her in Henry\u2019s tastes, and she carefully cultivated an image of herself as the perfectly submissive and passive woman \u2014 so much so that even modern historians often paint her as being bland and lacking in personality, a log carried along passively in the stream of the day\u2019s events. But Jane had an agenda, and that agenda was the restoration of the Old Faith, and getting Princess Mary back into her father\u2019s good graces and her position in the succession. Jane\u2019s first foray was before Anne Boleyn\u2019s arrest, when she tried to get Henry to reconcile with Mary. He slapped her down, saying she should be thinking of the children that she and Henry would have and how to promote their interests. So Jane waited until Anne was dead and she had the ring safely on her finger before trying again, this time to get him to spare some of the monasteries. That time, he warned her darkly to take heed of what had happened to the last woman who tried to meddle in his affairs. She kept her head down after that, hoping the child she carried would be a son. Perhaps after she gave the king a prince, she\u2019d have more influence\u2026 But she died, having never recovered from childbed. Perhaps had she lived, her reputation would be different and we would have seen more of her proactive nature in action, and historians wouldn\u2019t continually paint her as being \u201csweet\u201d and \u201cmild.\u201d Anna von Kleefes was also extraordinarily intelligent, every skilled at stoking Henry\u2019s ego once she realized her very life was at stake. Her first meeting with the king was a disaster, when he foolishly decided to meet her in disguise. Dressed as a peasant, he grabbed her and kissed her. Her disgusted reaction struck him to the core. It was probably the first time he\u2019d ever seen a look of disgust aimed in his direction. He decided she was the disgusting one and he wanted nothing to do with her. He was forced to go through with the marriage because he still needed the alliance with her brother, but as soon as the political situation changed, he demanded an annulment. Anna pretended to be reluctant and heartbroken, but obeyed the king\u2019s demand. Her lamentations of regret at losing such a wonderful husband made Henry inclined to be generous. Anna even rushed to be back at his side after he murdered his next wife, pretending to be eager to resume her place as his bride. Once she was sure she was permanently secure in his favor, she departed, wealthy and independent. She reportedly lived out a very happy life. Katheryn Howard devoted her short reign to reconciliation. She tried to bring people together and heal old wounds. Her generosity was spread over all of the factions. She pleaded for mercy for convicted traitors, regardless of whether they were her partisans. Her biggest expense was the fur-lined wardrobe of clothing she purchased for the elderly Countess Pole, who was imprisoned in the Tower and reportedly suffering from the cold and damp. Though her education was scant and she\u2019d certainly never been prepared for the role, she tried hard to be a good queen to her people. But she\u2019d been sexually active before her marriage and when the king found out about it, he demanded her head. Kateryn Parr was a brilliant woman, highly educated and devoted to the Protestant faith. She chose the tutors for the future king Edward VI (interestingly enough, they were once scholarship students hand-picked by Anne Boleyn.) She, too, learned to play the king\u2019s ego, getting him to cancel her planned arrest by telling him she only debated with him about religion so she could learn more from him. She only survived Henry\u2019s reign by the skin of her teeth, but sadly her life ended shortly afterward when she married a scoundrel (who tried to seduce her stepdaughter) and died in childbed. Every one of these women were amazing in their own way, and none of them deserved the sorry fate of being married to Henry VIII. ",
