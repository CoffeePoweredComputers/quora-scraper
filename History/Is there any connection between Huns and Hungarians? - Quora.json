            "answer_text": "short answer = If Hungarians never had contact with turkic people NO ,but for today : YES  around 1500 BC Fins and Ugrian splits and some ugaric people move even southern side of the Uralic mountain. the Ugrian speakers became distinguished from the rest of the Uralic community, of which the ancestors of the Magyars, being located farther south, were the most numerous. Judging by evidence from burial mounds and settlement sites,  Above you see Magna hungaria in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, the Hungarians moved from the west of the Ural Mountains to the area between the southern Ural Mountains and the Volga River known as Bashkiria (Bashkortostan) and Perm Krai. In the early 8th century, some of the Hungarians moved to the Don River to an area between the Volga, Don and the Seversky Donets rivers. Meanwhile, the descendants of those Hungarians who stayed in Bashkiria remained there as late as 1241.  Above you see a clearly route of the Hunnish people towards Europe\u2026  RED CIRCLE - Magna hungaria and numbers are shown are hunnish cauldrons findings right of the center of the Magna hungaria ,,, how ??? that gives a clue that Hungarian had early contact with Hunnish and other Turkic people..  Here is the world map around 500 AD right after Hun emperor ATTILA DEATH Hungarian = Magyars and all the red circles are Turkic clans eastern side of Hunnish vassals.HUN location the remaining son of Attila Ernak(hernac) clan, i will come this part later.. . its very clear that Magyar can\u2019t live a isolated life after so many Turkic tribes and so many years alone. it\u2019s accepted theory that Magyars were fin ugric 3000 BC. But after splitting some huge ugric population adapted Turkic culture and took many elements from them. You will clearly see a ancient Turkic words in their language.. i mean not just couple but many. the reason is that mainly because they were surrounded by many Turkic tribe for so many years. Attila death and his only decedent ERNAK When Attila Hun died in AD 453 , his only remaining son Ernek goes back to between Romanian -Ukraine to unite other Turkic tribes such as following live among other hunnish tribes such as ogurs and kutrigurs etc. Jordanes recounts c. 454-455: \"After the Ostrogoths led by their king Valamir, and his brothers Theodemirand Vidimir received Pannonia] Now it happened that the sons of Attila, regarding the Goths as deserters from their rule, came against them as though they were seeking fugitive slaves and attacked Valamir alone, when his brothers knew nothing of it. He sustained their attack, though he had but few with him, and after harassing them a long time, so utterly overwhelmed them that scarcely a portion of the enemy remained. The remnant turned in flight and sought the parts of Scythia which border on the stream of the river Danaber, which the Huns call in their own tongue Var. Whereupon he sent a messenger of good tidings to his brother Theodemir ... on the very day the messenger arrived ... Theoderic was born [in 454]\". \"Hernac, the younger son of Attila, with hiw followers, chose a home in the most distant part of Scythia Minor. Emnetzur and Ultzindur kinsmen of his, seized by force Oescus and Vtus and Almus in Dacia on the bank of the Danube, and many of the Huns, then swarming everywhere, betook themselves into Romania; descendants of them are to this day called Sacromontisi and Fossatisii\". HERNAC (ernak,irnak) after so many years later ernek had multiple decent one of the decent was no other than ARPAD also gesta hungarium states that \u00c1lmos descended \"from the line of Attila the Hun. A late 13th-century chronicler, Simon of K\u00e9za wrote that \u00c1lmos was \"of the Turul kindred (turul turkic tulo clan bird symbol) also famous oghuz khan symbol. so it\u2019s also stated that Huns had a turulbird arms of coat. also bulgarian ogur tribes or multi turkic tribes were ruled by another Atilla hun decent from ernek which formed DULO clan ;) there is also proven DNA in 2018 arpad dynasty King B\u00e9la III are central Asian origin \u2026 which gives a clear conclusion. when king arpad migrated to hungaria also huge kabar khazar tribe and 7 magyars were migrated. that give a clue that Hungarian had no problem with Turkic ruler and kabar tribes. they live a long peaceful life after so many centuries later another Turkic tribe are welcomed by Hungarian . they were called CUMANS so today Hungarian does have variety mix blood in them some of them sure hunic origin, some of them kabar turkic some of them cuman turkic what most imported is that the majorities are ugric origin of course late century German and Slavic mixing also undeniably ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Practically all chronicles of the Hungarian kingdom state such, all collected myths state such and we even understand name of Atilla to this day: aTiLla >> iTaL (drink). It originally meant river or \u201cflowing water\u201d and when we came back to reclaim lands in 896 first we stopped a bit in \u201cETeLk\u00f6z\u201d which means \u201cbetween-rivers\u201d (same as what Meso-potamia means at an other location and other language). Atilla was also called \u201cEtele\u201d if you have doubts. Hunor and Magor were brothers - sons of Nimr\u00f3d in land of Evil\u00e1th he exerted to when he felt that languages started to mix up at the Tower of B\u00e1bel. We have a different version of the story from our sources and a complete lineage up to Nimr\u00f3d. This indicates not an inheritance lineage directly, but when Csaba (which was likely a title of the smallest son of Atilla) went back to the steppes after the battle of Hun infighting over Atilla\u2019s death and manipulations of foreign forces he choose to go back among the remaining Hungarians (Magyars - sons of Magor / Magyar) and with him the two brothers lineages united once again. Earlier it was brotherly help and with him being on the direct lineage the Turul dynasty (which only modern Historians call \u00c1rp\u00e1dians - he had a father and a lineage already and they called themselves as Turul dynasty hey) became direct descendant to Huns too this way - also part of the population. Also Iazig people (J\u00e1sz) and other Hungarians are even more ancient in the area. See old maps of Roman empire who waged wars against them\u2026 ",
