            "answer_text": "Concerns had previously been voiced about the danger of the spoil tip being located directly above the village\u2019s local junior school, such as in a letter written in 1963 to the NCB regarding the \u201cdanger from coal slurry being tipped at the rear of the Pantglas Schools\u201d. However, measures were not put into place by the NCB to prevent the calamitous event from occurring. As such, plenty of anger felt by the grieving village was directed towards the NCB as members of the community struggled to come to terms with the Aberfan disaster.  In the weeks leading up to the preventable tragedy, the village experienced a significant amount of rainfall. This led to rainwater building up within the colliery tip, causing it to collapse and cause a slurry. Travelling at a high speed, the landslide rushed down the mountain slope, destroying two farm cottages on the land before reaching Pantglas Junior School. The academic institution was struck by an avalanche of thick mud and sludge just as the day\u2019s lessons had commenced. Had the landslide occurred just half an hour earlier, before the children had arrived at school, or three hours later, when they would have broken up for half-term, many of the children may not have lost their lives. One hundred and nine children and five teachers lost their lives in the school, which was engulfed by the contents of the colliery tip. The total number of fatalities reached 144. In their final moments, several members of staff at Pantglas Junior School did all they could to protect the pupils in their care. Nansi Williams, a dinner lady at the school who perished in the disaster, used her body to shield five children, all of whom survived thanks to her selfless act. ",

            "answer_text": "Aberfan was a mining village and there were what were called slag heaps which is coal shards that were piled up and they collapsed and took out a school and homes. It was dreadful, but I suggest you google it if you are really interested because I don\u2019t have the statistics or even the date. I remember seeing in on Pathe News, we didn\u2019t have a television, and the Queen and Prince Philip visited and were very visibly shaken up by the scene of devastation. ",
