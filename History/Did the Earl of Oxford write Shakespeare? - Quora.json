            "answer_text": "Academic agreement is that Shakespeare was actually written by a chap called William Shakespeare. He was a grammar school boy from Warwickshire. However some academics have gone off on a theory which is the literary world\u2019s equivalent of \u201cflat earth\u201d. The Earl of Oxford thing is a product of that. Because there\u2019s no way that a proley little snot from the Midlands could possibly write words that not only scorched across the stage on winged heels, but then ran round the audience and slapped them around the back of the head, making them pay attention to the artfully constructed sentences in a way that none had before, inventing, as they went, new and exciting phrases that have endured down the ages and many of which we utter still, four hundred years hence. Because deary me, how can such a grubby little oik be a master wordsmith? Nope. Absolutely not. Must be the Earl, mustn\u2019t it, because if Shakespeare were alive today he\u2019d probably be a Brexit voter, the chav. Mucky peasants from the Midlands, indeed. Tsk. How very dare they! :P ",
