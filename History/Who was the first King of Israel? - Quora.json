            "answer_text": "The first three kings of Israel, meaning the first three people that The Torah calls Melech over the entire Jewish people within the tribal territories of Cannaan are Shaul, David, and Solomon. They were also the only three kings who ruled the entire Jewish people within the Land of Israel as kings. Certain prophets such as Moses, Joshua, and Samuel had the authority of a king, but the only one that is ever called a king is Moses. However Moses is called a king only in a way that is dependant on an alternate understanding of Hebrew Grammar. These three prophets have the status of a non-hereditary king called a moshel (Dictator). That said, as far as the word melech (king), this is used only for Saul, David, and Solomon when used in reference over the entire Jewish people rather than a territory within Canaan such as \u201cking of Judah\u201d or \u201cking of Israel\u201d. In fact in Jewish tradition even the future messiah will not be a king, but an annoined viceroy. He is refered to in Ezekiel and Isaiah as a Sar (Viceroy) not as a king. The reason for this is that The Messiah is an agent of the Sanhedrin and its future head Elijah The Prophet who never died. Think of the Sanhedrin and the Prophet as the voice and lips of Divine will vs. the hand of Divine will. Unlike past kings The Messiah will not have autonomy authority. He will not be \u201clike a king from the nations\u201d. It could be argued that Saul and David were both from the same royal house anointed by Samuel and his immediate student Nathan was the first to anoint the house of David. Therefore as such Solomon and the following Dynasties were in a different category than the previous kings. Sollomon relied on wisdom and made the mistake of being lured by his ability to analyze things. Saul made the mistake of delaying to do a command, and David made the mistake of delaying in turning away from something, but both admitted their guilt and repented. Saul's was much more serious because he was sinless up to this point and this affected the entire nation. It was his only sin. David was held less culpable because it was a personal sin. Notice that Saul lost his kingship, whereas David is shown to have to endure the various incidents within his own family and the death of his various sons. Solomon, however made the error of using human wisdom to try and allow himself to do things. Unlike Saul and David this wasn't and error based on a slight delay in following the will of G-D. Solomon rationalized his actions. This led to the collapse of the United Kingdom of Israel under his son who continued this line of thinking and taxed the people leading to a civil war that lasted until the northern kingdom fell to Assyria. It was this attitude that led to the eventual causes of Babylonian Exile. Elements of this war have lasted until today. The religious and Traditional Jews are those who followed after the Kingdom of Judah's values and the Helenistic or secular Jews are those who followed after non-Jewish values. Its a conflict that is in Israel today. Netanyahu for example is the Nationalistic-Religious (Jerusalem mentality) vs. Gantz the Inclusive-Secular (Tel Aviv/Northern Israel mentality). This conflict led to the destruction of the northern part of Israel. Even so elements of rationalism plaugue both sides. The first two kings of Israel, Saul and David represented two kings with total faith in G-D and Solomon represented the begining of the \u201cage of reason\u201d within Judaism. A righteous king who tried to find a way to do the prohibited. Judaism uses reason only to apply the absolute and established directives of prophetic theology and morality in a system of laws. Solomon tried to understand the laws based on what is the \u201creason\u201d rather than as absolute directives that had established boundaries. Wisdom aka analytical thinking is used in Judaism for use in the application of law, not to allow what is known to be 100% forbidden. Israel as a united nation and people had only three real kings: Saul, David, and Solomon. Its first three kings. Its last king will be a viceroy not a king, because he will not make the mistake of delay or rationalization, he will apply the Divine will as stated by Elijah The Prophet and the Sanhedrin (Supreme Religious Court of Rabbis and Jewish Priests) who will speak for The Creator and true King. He will bring all Jews to Israel, make world peace, and dedicate the Temple in his lifetime and carry the commands of the Prophet Elijah when and how he is told to do so. Correcting Saul's hesitation, avoiding David's temptation, and totally removing Solomon's flaw of relying on the human mind and reason to follow Divine Will. Israel will only ever have a King in G-D henceforth. Elijah as His Prophetic mouth, and the messiah as the hand of the Prophet. In fact the Messiah is never refered to as a king in the Tanach, but as a type of prince known in english as a viceroy or in Hebrew as a Saar. Three kings were all we ever really had. Saul, David, and Solomon. Beforehand Three national transitional leaders with absolute power whon represented eras. Joseph (Egytptian Exile), Moses (The Exodus), Joshua (The conquest of the land and the Era of Judges). We had three patriarchs before that. Abraham, Issac, and Jacob. Today in Judaism we are at the era of the students of the Prophets. This era is called the Rabbinic Era and it has undergone three stages. The Era of the Mishnaic Sages, The Era of the Sages of the Gemara, and the era of the sages who completed the Talmud. The second stage was the stage before Israel was regained. It could be considered the stage of local authority. Each communal Rabbinic court followed its tradition faithfully and Today the third and final stage of the Rabbinic Era can be said to be the INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY OF THE ISRAELI RABINATE over Jews. Today all Jews in the world are either defined as Jewish as and/or recognized as converts as well as married under Jewish Law only in absolute terms if recognized by the Rabbinate of Israel. This broad authority is expanding to other areas as Israel has an absolute standard for testing on Jewish Law and Rabbinic certification. Every Rabbi certified in Israel is recognized as such outside of Israel, but not every rabbinic school outside of Israel is accepted by the Israeli Rabbinate as teaching Judaism according to Jewish tradition. This has led to the Jewish Rabbinate and The Jewish State of Israel becoming the global Rabbinic Authority and to a certain extent the State becoming an agent of the Rabbinate. This Third era of the Rabbinate is the final one because adherence is voluntary and non-Jews who have Jewish ancestry can still move to Israel But once this ceases to stop being the case we will have a new Jewish historical era. The Era of a Jewish State run under Jewish Law. A Torah State. This will have an era of Liberal Jewish Law. Moderate Jewish Law. Strict Jewish Law before it becomes focused on the establishment of a Temple. And this will be the test of Judaism. If Judaism manages to build a Temple in Israel as dictated by Jewish Law and Tradition with all necessary conditions met then Judaism is true and Israel is indeed ours. If it does not then the Jewish people will begin another exile and near genocide and we will loose the land of Israel once more and the cycle will begin once more at the second stage of the Rabbinic Era. There are only three kings in Judaism because the kingship fulfilled its mission, to prepare the path for the prince of peace who acts on behalf of the Prophet with the Covenant of Peace. He who is known as Elijah the Prophet who speaks for The Creator. The same prophet who was known once as Phineas and was in Egypt and was given the Covenant of Peace in the wilderness after acting with zeal. The Prophet who never died. The only Prophet who was in Egypt and learnt from his Uncle Moses directly and his Grandfather Aaron. Who learnt alongside Joshua. Who was at Sinai and did not sin at the golden calf. Elijah the Prophet. Israel's kingship has the goal to prepare the ruler of Israel who will obey a Prophet and not be a \u201cking like those of the nations\u201d. It is the Prophet who commands the king, not the king who commands the people. And the Prophet speaks the word of G-D. If Israel builds the third temple as per Jewish Law that is the proof of the ruler's validity as the messiah, the annoined prince. Until it does it is transitional. And like the Forefathers, Post Egyptian Prophets, Kings, and Rabbis, as well as even a Torah State era until the Temple is built its all transitional. But when it's built its there. If its built its forever, that's what built means. If its the True Temple it lasts forever. Three kings are all we had because that is all we needed. Each established that trait that would lead to the path to The Temple. Saul taught unity of the Jewish people and brotherhood, equality. David taught the ability to be personally intimate with G-D in a relationship of friendship instead of slave. Solomon taught the ability to look deeper into the word of G-D. The messiah will teach to have faith in the will of G-D even when it contradicts your own way of looking at things. He will teach that faith supersedes extreme mindsets. That is what The Temple stands for. Faith in G-D even when it contradicts our own viewpoint. ",

            "answer_text": " In the period that preceded the monarchy, Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit (Judges 21:25). God raised up Samuel to lead the people (1 Samuel 3:4). All of Israel knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord (1 Samuel 3:20). Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life, and when he was old he made his sons judges over Israel (1 Samuel 8:1). Israel rejected the sons, refused to obey Samuel, and demanded a king (1 Samuel 8:19\u201320). When Samuel reported their request to God, the Lord answered, \u201cListen to them and give them a king\u201d (1 Samuel 8:22). Saul was the first king. He was of the tribe of Benjamin, which, in the days of the judges, had almost been annihilated. Tall, handsome, and humble, Saul began his reign with a victory over the Ammonites. Any misgivings about the new monarchy disappeared. But success rapidly went to Saul\u2019s head, and humility gave place to pride. He offered a sacrifice, which was the exclusive function of priests, showing his presumed self-importance. He deliberately disobeyed God, causing God to tell Samuel.. \u201cThen came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying, It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night.\u201d 1 Samuel 15:10\u201311 Saul reigned unsuccessfully from 1049 BC to 1009 BC, then, wounded in battle, he \u201ctook his own sword and fell on it\u201d (1 Samuel 31:4). David, although anointed as king when just a boy, did not ascend to the throne until after Saul\u2019s death (2 Samuel 2:4). David was short of stature, ruddy, of unusual countenance, handsome, and of immense physical strength and great personal attractiveness. He was a man of war, prudent in speech, brave, musical, and religious. God promised that David\u2019s family should reign forever. \u201cAnd there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:\u201d Isaiah 11:1 (The stump of Jesse is Davids father, the branch is Jesus.) After Saul\u2019s death, David was made king over Judah, and seven years later he was made king over all Israel. He was 30 years old when he became king and reigned from 1009 BC to 969 BC. Solomon became king in 971 BC, two years before his father David died, and reigned until 931 BC. Solomon was born of Bathsheba, and, though not directly in line for the succession, he was chosen by David and approved by God to be David\u2019s successor (1 Chronicles 23:1). Solomon inherited the throne of the most powerful kingdom then existing. It was an era of peace and prosperity with vast business enterprises and literary attainments. God told Solomon to ask what he would, and it would be given to him. Solomon asked for wisdom to govern his people. That pleased God, who richly rewarded him with wealth, wisdom, power, and the important task of building the temple (1 Chronicles 28:2\u20136). After the death of Solomon, the kingdom was divided. Ten tribes formed the Northern Kingdom, called Israel; Judah and Benjamin formed the Southern Kingdom, called Judah. The date of the division of the kingdom is approximately 931 BC. The following is a list of the kings of Israel and Judah following the death of Israels third King Solomon. The dates of their reigns are approximate, due to overlapping reigns, associated sovereignty, intervals of anarchy, and the Jewish practice of counting parts of years as full years. Portions of some reigns were concurrent. All the kings of Israel practiced idolatry; the worst served Baal. Many of the kings of Judah served idols; few served the Lord faithfully. Some bad kings were partly good; some good kings partly bad. The kings, the approximate dates of their reigns, and descriptions of their overall obedience to God are listed below: KINGS OF ISRAEL: Jeroboam I, rebellious, 931\u2014910 BCNadab, bad, 910\u2014909 BCBaasha, wicked, 909\u2014886 BCElah, evil, 886\u2014885 BCZimri, sinful, 885 BCTibni, iniquitous, 885\u2014880 BCOmri (overlap), extra bad, 885\u2014874 BCAhab, the worst to that point, 874\u2014853 BCAhaziah, disobedient, 853\u2014852 BCJoram/Jehoram, mostly rotten, 852\u2014841 BCJehu, not good but better than the rest, 841\u2014814 BCJehoahaz, noncompliant, 814\u2014798 BCJoash, wayward, 798\u2014782 BCJeroboam II (overlap), badly behaved, 793\u2014753 BCZechariah, abysmal, 753 BCShallum, full of vice, 752 BCMenahem, horrible, 752\u2014742 BCPekahiah, idolatrous, 742\u2014740 BCPekah (overlap), awful, 752\u2014732 BCHoshea, appalling, 732\u2014722 BC KINGS OF JUDAH:Rehoboam, mostly bad, 931\u2014913 BCAbijah, mostly perverted, 913\u2014911 BCAsa, good, 911\u2014870 BCJehoshaphat (overlap), righteous, 873\u2014848 BCJehoram/Joram (overlap), terrible, 853\u2014841 BCAhaziah, bad, 841 BCAthaliah (queen), devilish, 841\u2014835 BCJoash/Jehoash, mostly virtuous, 835\u2014796 BCAmaziah, mostly wholesome, 796\u2014767 BCUzziah/Azariah (overlap), mostly respectable, 790\u2014739 BCJotham (overlap), worthy, 750\u2014731 BCAhaz, heinous, 735\u2014715 BCHezekiah, the best, 715\u2014686 BCManasseh, depraved until he repented at the end, 695\u2014642 BCAmon, treacherous, 642\u2014640 BCJosiah, great, 640\u2014609 BCJehoahaz, dreadful, 609 BCJehoiakim, degenerate, 609\u2014597 BCJehoiachin, frightful, 597 BCZedekiah, foolish, 597\u2014586 BC ",
