            "answer_text": "By reading them or reading reputable translations if they are in a language you can\u2019t read. Or am I missing something here?  Expansion on original question: I mean, they are really hard to understand with the way they formulate their sentences. ahhhhh\u2026.yes, that is absolutely true. Academic historians who are also really good and readable writers are not common. Academic historians love to use extremely complex sentence structure using uncommon words that have you scurrying to the dictionary. I swear that academic historians consider themselves failures if their readers don\u2019t have to read the same sentence a dozen times to understand it. As to older documents: What makes up good writing changes over the years. Historical documents were written to the standard of the times they inhabited. You can really see the difference in newspapers and novels from then and now. The sentence structure and word selection is completely different now to then. My advice is to sit down and paraphrase each sentence as you read it, that can really help. ",
