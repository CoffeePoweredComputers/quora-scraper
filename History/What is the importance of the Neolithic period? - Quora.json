            "answer_text": "Well, virtually nothing that we recognize as familiar aspects of society (or at least of society as it\u2019s known by 99.9% of the people living in the world today) would exist or work in the same way without the Neolithic period. It was arguably the most transformative period of human history, perhaps even surpassing in long-term impact our current era of major technological breakthroughs and highly complex industrial achievements. Without the changes and innovations that happened during the Neolithic period, forget about agriculture, animal domestication, largely sedentary lifestyle, food surplus to free some people from the need to work every day to feed themselves and their children, large-scale societies and polities formed by many thousands of people, highly specialized labor (professions), professional armies, cities and even permanent towns, large-scale trade between distant populations, organized states, much more pressing need to co-operate and make collective efforts (productive agriculture requires more people working together for the same purpose than bands simply hunting and gathering on their own).  Therefore, ultimately you\u2019d probably miss writing, complex mathematics and accounting, more rigid and varied social hierarchies, huge public works and monuments, the constant and increasing need for more sophisticated tools to help in those ever more specialized works and ideologies to keep people together, all in all, you\u2019d miss civilization. And the world wouldn\u2019t have billions of people, but at best some dozens of millions of people, because otherwise huge famines and awful competition for resources would happen, because people wouldn\u2019t have learned how to extract much more nutrients from the land they already occupy.   So, yeah, it is impossible to overstate the importance of the Neolithic period for humankind. ",
