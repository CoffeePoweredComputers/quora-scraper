            "answer_text": " Edward the Confessor, enthroned. Bayeux tapestry from your example. Let us consider three aspects of your question. First, technology. Cloth dies fade, the shape sags and stretches. The uneven lines are not what the tapestry looked like in 11th century; the colors were likely much brighter. Another technology was ink on vellum. That ages much better:  Beatus of Li\u00e9bana: Commentary on the Apocalypse 1028-72Manuscript (Cod. Lat. 8878)Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris We note anatomical difficulties here and there, but I wouldn\u2019t call this illumination crude. The artist is limited by the technology: inks cannot be mixed, erasing the ink is virtually impossible once it\u2019s dried; over-painting does not completely eliminate the earlier layer. The art of the modern history (say, 15-19th century) is typically oils on canvas or board. It ages well and less time has passed since its creation. More importantly, oils mix: infinite gradations in color value are possible. Nearly infinite corrections are possible by scrubbing away old paint that stays wet for days, over-painting dried paint, or glazing transparently over layers of paint. Michelangelo had tens of glazed overlays on his Mona Lisa. This is the secret of the realism in academic art.  The Elder Sister. Bouguereau, 1869 Very nice. Now do it in a dozen fixed colors without corrections, good luck. A good artist is aware of the technological limitations and is capitalizing on it. Tapestry gives you fuzzy lines and flat colors, but it can do powerful thick lines and geometric patterns. It also has pleasant interplay of different textures. Look how lovingly the architectural images blend with fantastical vegetation and animals, how some walls are filled with intricate ornamentation: it is not a portrait of a king, it is a beautiful object decorating a room. The ink on vellum offers excellent precision of thin lines. The line drawing of the personages is incredibly good, filled with energy. Look how expressive the hand gestures are! They point, they plead, they warn, they are eager and at the same time dignified. Enjoy the folds on the red tunics of the angels. Truly they are heavenly creatures, \u2014 compare with the plain gravity-obeying falls of the garments of John and Deacon Prochorus. Then look at the pointed wings, \u2014 they look like weapons. Are the faces somewhat unnatural? Not really, \u2014 they are line drawings too and they do the technology\u2019s best. The strong jaws and arched brows are exaggerated for a purpose: they are transmitting divine command. The medieval artist found the same technique the cartoon artists use today when they need to express mood. Note on the lower panel how the terrifying stare of the angel delivering the book changes to resolute but obedient expression of St. John, and then to frightened and uncomprehending gaze of the secretary. And all these psychological portraits are done with simple same-thickness pen-drawn lines. The next different aspect is that of the purpose of art. The modern-era art shows. Medieval art explains. Bouguereau created an illusion: there is a window in the museum wall, and look \u2014 there is a pretty girl with a wistful, a bit tired expression on her face sitting on a lawn. By careful application of the laws of optics an illusion is created and the illusion is pleasing the eye. The medieval artist did not attempt to show you a focus-pocus. He simply tells you the narrative contained in the Apocalypse though visual means: And I heard a voice from heaven again speaking to me, and saying: Go, and take the book that is open, from the hand of the angel who standeth upon the sea, and upon the earth. And I went to the angel, saying unto him, that he should give me the book. And he said to me: Take the book, and eat it up: and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey. And I took the book from the hand of the angel, and ate it up: and it was in my mouth, sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said to me: Thou must prophesy again to many nations, and peoples, and tongues, and kings. (Apocalypse 10:8\u201311) Maybe you can\u2019t read very well, maybe not at all. The illumination illumines the essential: \u201cHere angel receives the book\u201d, \u201cHere priest John is spoken to by the angel\u201d. The language is primarily visual, and very powerfully done, but the meaning has to be delivered to you, the viewer, without fail, so short inscriptions accompany the artwork. Nothing here intends to amuse or please. Medieval illuminations seek to inform; they are to art what technical drawings are to engineering. So is everything medieval: they shunned Hellenic sensuality, playful trompe-l'\u0153il of modernity was to them, simply, dishonesty. They were thinking people; that was the true Age of Reason. Look at this:  St. Anthony the Great, St. Anthony Coptic monastery, Egypt. This is a fresco, \u2014 rapid technique of painting on wet stucco, which dictated another limitation: the artist had to finish his work within hours. You can see quick, broad brushstrokes. Observe the outstanding skill delivering the facial features in just a few hits with the brush. But this is the remarkable thing: the saint is shown delivering a building, presumably, the monastery that he founded. Do you think the viewers were led into thinking that St. Anthony played with doll houses? Or that he was a giant able to lift buildings? Of course not: the artists delivers, with great artistic economy, the necessary knowledge: you are inside the walls of the first monastery of Christendom, and this is who built it. Which leads me to this distinction: all medieval art was religious art because it was ordered to please God, not man. Sure there was a measure of ornamentalism, \u2014 look at the border of the St. John\u2019s illumination. But even the ornamentation was not to deliver amusement but to reveal the mathematics of the geometric design, because we may have forgotten it, but mathematics are from God. And what pleases God? Giving you, dear viewer, knowledge of God. The subject matter could be mundane, like a view of some battle, or divine, like God revealing the purpose of the cosmos to St. John the Theologian. In all cases that was not entertainment but transmission of truth. The simplicity of medieval art reflects not inability of the medieval artist to comprehend laws of perspective and three-dimensional shading, but his earnest dedication to glorify God in His works. He knew that the material: stone, ink, stucco, \u2014 resisted and limited his human work. But he also knew that the splendor of God is not in visible effects, but in the absolutes of the truth that God reveals in simple terms for all of us to understand: let your speech be yea, yea: no, no: and that which is over and above these, is of evil. (Matthew 5:37) There was a Russian priest and theologian, murdered by the Bolsheviks, who wrote much on the theology of Byzantine iconography, Pavel Florensky. I won\u2019t be able to find this passage of his, and I doubt it has been translated, but I remember it vividly. With great acidity he made fun of the famous Raphael\u2019s madonna.  Sistine Madonna. Raphael. 1512 He noted the cloy sensuality, the absurd three-dimensionality of walking and kneeling on clouds, the bored, well-fed cherubs. But the height of his sarcasm was when he noted the curtain. Was the artist really intending to say that the painting was a clever illusion, like the work of a magician on a theatrical stage? Was the artist proud to stun us with his skill? What theology could possible be telling us that we are watching a circus show? I agree that technology of art evolved and the skill set of an artist followed where that led. Far be it from me to ridicule Raphael: his is sincere work of piety. But the critical change was from the mentality of a christian believer whose art was a form of prayer, to an artist as entertainer. Techniques, we gained. Truth, we lost. ",

            "answer_text": "Robert Hugh Benson, author of Lord of the World (Pope Francis' favorite novel), writes in Dawn of All: \u201cArt, you remember, in the end of the Victorian era had attempted to become realistic\u2014had attempted, that is, the absurdly impossible; and photography exposed the absurdity, For no man can be truly a realist, since it is literally impossible to paint or to describe all that the eye sees. When photography became general, this began to be understood; since it was soon seen that the only photographer who could lay any claim to artistic work was the man who selected and altered and posed\u2014arranged his subject, that is to say, in more or less symbolic form. Then people began to see again that Symbolism was the underlying spirit of Art\u2014as they had known perfectly well, of course, in medieval days: that Art consisted in going beneath the material surfaces that reflected light, or the material events that happened, in painting and literature respectively, and, by a process of selection, of symbolizing (not photographically representing) the Ideas beneath the Things\u2014the Substance beneath the Accidents\u2014the Thought beneath the Expression\u2014(you can call it what you like). Zola in literature, Strauss in music, the French school of painting\u2014these reduced Realism ad absurdum. Thus once more the Catholic Church, in this as in everything else, was discovered to have possessed the secret all along. The Symbolic Reaction therefore began, and all our music, all our painting, and all our literature to-day are frankly and confessedly Symbolic\u2014that is, Catholic. And this too, you see, pointed to the same lesson as Psychology, that beneath phenomena there was a Force which transcended phenomena; and that the Church had dealt with this Force, knowing It to be Personal, through all her history.\u201d Certainly, technical limitations and \u201cstyle\u201d in the sense of mere fashion contributed to, in painting, going from less Realism in Byzantine or Romanesque style, to Gothic, Renaissance and up to the French schools. But consider first the other plastic arts. Statuary, metalwork, architecture of the Medieval was often very realistic or intricate. They understood that realism is more important when working in three dimensions opposed to two, where the limitation of depth is intrinsic to the medium. Consider next the modern/post-modern reaction against realism/detail and intricacy not only in painting but in statuary, music, architecture, and literature. What would an historian in a thousand years think about technical and stylistic limitations from that sculpture of a banana taped to a wall or certain abstract paintings? The main problem of this is the mindset that art evolves like animals by natural selection or areas of technological development. Art is about spirit and mind not techne. ",
