            "answer_text": "It was a tricky task, which defied several centuries of effort. Hieroglyphic writing was a very complex, ambiguous system mixing at least 4 different styles of encoding: Alphabetic \u2014 some signs represent a single sound like they do in modern Latin scriptsSyllabic \u2014 some signs represent a whole syllable, not just a single \u2018letter\u2019 ( in fact, some represent two syllables)Ideographic \u2014 some signs represent an entire ideaDeterminative \u2014 to help distinguish between the first three, some signs are there to tell the reader how to read other signs: they don\u2019t represent individual words or sounds.It also didn\u2019t help that there was a lot of misinformation floating around as well. Greek and Roman era descriptions of the hieroglyphic system tended to lean very heavily on the symbolic and \u2018philosophical\u2019 meanings of the signs \u2014 some of which were correct but many of which were pure nonsense. This gave many later scholars the idea that the entire language was purely symbolic. Thanks to this, some renaissance era students, for example, believed it was a non-verbal \u2018symbolic\u2019 language what could be read without reference to any language at all. This was, of course, not correct and led to some silly misreadings.  This Renaissance era \u201ctranslation\u201d is pure speculation, based on a symbolic interpretation of the signs Luckily, many efforts down the years were based on the correct guess that the language of the inscriptions was basically what we now call Coptic \u2014 thus, if one could actually figure out how to connect the symbols to sounds you would not have to recreate the language as well. Some other kinds of writing represent extinct languages \u2014 decoding those is a much more hopeless task.  The Rosetta Stone, in hieroglyphics (top), demotic (center), and Greek (bottom). photo: Hans Hillewaert The big break was the discovery, in 1799, of the Rosetta Stone. It\u2019s a tri-lingual inscription featuring the same proclamation (a humdrum temple dedication) in two different Egyptian writing systems and in ancient Greek. This provided a way to start definitively assigning known sound values to some of the signs. Multilingual inscriptions like this are vital to deciphering lost languages \u2014 it was the discovery of another trilingual text at Behistun in Iran which enabled the decoding of the cuneiform writing system in the 1830\u2019s.  Champollion The key to the puzzle was the fact that the Egyptian scribes wrote the names of royalty inside of a special symbol \u2014 a lozenge-like shape called a cartouche, which symbolizes the ring of a Pharoah. When the descriptions of the stone reached Europe, French linguist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion guessed correctly that those cartouches were the mark of royalty, which enabled him to start swapping in something like the correct sounds for a few of the signs. He found the name of the Greek king Ptolemy (Ptolemaios) in the Greek text and matched it up to symbols in the cartouches on the Rosetta stone. Another mixed Greek-Egyptian text included a mention of Ptolemy\u2019s queen, Cleopatra. Since those names contained some common elements he was able to identify a few symbols solidly. Here\u2019s how it went (this is laid out in more detail here). First, he broke the names in the cartouches down into pieces:  became  and  became  As you can see there are a few correspondences. So what if number 4 above is number 2 below? That\u2019s the \u201cL\u201d In Ptolemaios and Kleopatra. By the same logic, #1 above is #5 below, the \u201cP\u201d By comparing these he was able to get values for P, T, O, and L which are common. He guessed that number 7 in the first image would have to be \u201cS\u201d, and the vowels he knew from Greek. That gave an almost complete lineup. He noticed, though, that there are some extra symbols in \u201cKleopatra\u201d, which should have 9 letters but has 11 symbols. He supposed \u2014 not quite correctly \u2014 that numbers 10 and 11 were the ideogram for \u201cgoddess\u201d since that formed part of Cleopatra\u2019s title. Number 10 is actually a gender marker indicating a female name; but it was a clue to the use of determinatives and other non-alphabetic signs. Champollion was, actually, quite lucky: not all Egyptian signs map so neatly onto individual alphabetic letters. But using these two small pieces of evidence he was able to get several letter sounds and the mixed use of alphabetic and ideographic signs. With a knowledge of Coptic and the Greek text, he could start expanding this understanding outwards finding more and more symbols and correspondences. It\u2019s important to remember that this was a long project involving many people \u2014 Champollion gets the biggest share of the credit but he didn\u2019t decode the whole system single-handedly. Other scholars had correctly identified some symbols before him and his contemporaries Johan David \u00c5kerblad and Thomas Young both made important discoveries about the nature and structure of the Rosetta text around the same time (Young, for example, was able to find the word \u2018king\u2019 in the hieroglyphs by noting how often it came up in the Greek text even though he didn\u2019t know the sound values for the word). There were many ups and downs along the road, and Champollion\u2019s fiery temperament didn\u2019t win him a lot of friends, even among his admirers. Over the next hundred or so years many scholars pushed the system forwards, to the point were we now have a pretty solid understanding of written hieroglyphics and their offshoots, Hieratic and Demotic. It\u2019s still a very complex system with room for argument and misunderstanding (there are at more than 700 common symbols!) . Classical Egyptian civilization lasted for more than 3,000 years \u2014 even in ultra-conservative Egypt that\u2019s a long time for changes in style and substance to take place. So we still can\u2019t pick up Egyptian texts and read them casually. Sill, the fact that we\u2019ve reclaimed this language is a monument to human cleverness. It\u2019s perhaps worth noting that this was almost entirely a volunteer effort, spread out across several countries and languages. Citizen Science for the win! An excellent introduction for the curious is Egyptian Hieroglyphs for Complete Beginners by Bill Manley. It\u2019s not a grammar book or an introduction to the literature \u2014 but it does show you how to spot the basic structure and intent of a hieroglyphic text. ",

            "answer_text": "Ever since the loss of the art of reading the sacred Egyptian writing, it was widely assumed that Egyptian hieroglyphs were symbolic in nature. Some compared them to Classical Chinese\u2014a script which did not reflect the way ordinary people spoke but conveyed a very specific message. Most of the suggestions that it could have been at least partially phonetic were usually dismissed as nonsensical and you can definitely see a point there. Would you assume that a script composed of pictures resembling people and animals legitimately represents pronunciation?  Antoine-Isaac Silvestre de Sacy\u2014the man who not only came up with the theory of some of the hieroglyphs being phonetic but actually taught three of the men who would later prove essential to cracking the ancient code. In the early 1800s, shortly after the monumental discovery of the famed stone bearing a bilingual and triscriptual inscription in 1799 by an officer in the French garrison at the Egyptian town of Rosetta, some of these established ideas began being questioned. The Frenchman Antoine-Isaac Silvestre de Sacy and his Swedish student Johan David \u00c5kerblad noticed that some portions of the Demotic text seemed to correspond in their frequency and placement to those in the Greek version. Thus they were able to come up with translations of a few Egyptian words in the Demotic which by now was beginning to be recognized as just another rendition of the hieroglyphic text rather than that of a completely unrelated language. However, the Demotic text also included some ideograms and overall proved too hard a crack for de Sacy and \u00c5kerblad. The two men, having grown frustrated with the unrewarding nature of the decipherement challenge, gave up.  Thomas Young, one of the most important contributors to the final decipherment. But another of de Sacy\u2019s students, a Briton named Thomas Young, was only now getting invested in the hieroglyphic puzzle. And even though de Sacy had long stopped working on the script himself, he did correspond with Young who was trying his best. At one point towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars, de Sacy put forward the suggestion that the Egyptians would have to at the very least resort to phonetic rendition of terms that were not native to their language, which also was the case in Classical Chinese (a Chinese student he had met told him about it). The Greek name of the king the Stone was dedicated to was such a foreign term. Young picked up the idea and continued his exhausted teacher\u2019s aborted work. And while there was a possibility the Egyptian scribe would have instead just turned to the name\u2019s etymology, which most definitely would have been obvious to him, and created something along the lines of \u201cSon of war\u201d (which would coincidentally align quite well with the Egyptian naming convention), I guess we can thank Oziris it wasn\u2019t the case. And so, Young took a closer look at the cartouches and tried to work out which of the characters could stand for which sounds.  These days, hieroglyphs tend to be depicted as running from left to right (the giveaway is the direction the hieroglyphs \u201cface\u201d: if it\u2019s right, then it\u2019s from the right that you start reading\u2014if it\u2019s left, then you obviously read from the left) in order to make things easier on a Western reader, however a lot points us to believe that the right\u2013left direction of writing was preferred by Ancient Egyptians\u2014it was how the Demotic script was encoded, for instance. And thus, if you have ever seen a Rosetta Stone Ptolemy cartouche on the Internet, it likely ran from left to right, even though the real thing was reversed, as depicted above. After lots of trials and errors, Young could finally pump his fists into the air in triumph. The \u201ctransliteration\u201d wasn\u2019t certain and most definitely didn\u2019t look perfect but it was a start.  De Sacy\u2019s theory proved to have a solid footing\u2014now Young needed to make it take the first step. The best way was to obtain yet another Egyptian transliteration of a Greek name and try out the same approach. Cleopatra (\u039a\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1), the name assumed by so many of the numerous Ptolemies\u2019 daughters (and, more often than not, the future wives of their sons), seemed like a perfect candidate as it could be reasonably expected to contain at the very least the hieroglyphs for [p] and [l] that were used to write down Ptolemy. Immeditely upon getting his hands on a drawing of a cartouche that was suspected to represent Cleopatra, he could pump his fists in the air yet again. De Sacy\u2019s phonetic assumption was proven correct beyond any doubt:  By this time, Young\u2019s discoveries had reinvigorated the interest in the Rosetta Stone which had up until recently been dismissed as an unsolveable puzzle. Professional and amateur linguists dusted off their copies of the inscription and returned to locking themselves up in their cabinets for a few hours on every given day trying to crack the code. One of these men was, amusingly enough, yet another of de Sacy\u2019s former students, his fellow Frenchman Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion. The two men hadn\u2019t spoken in years after their conflicting political opinions of Napoleon\u2019s campaign (with de Sacy being a staunch royalist and Champollion a dedicated believer in the Napoleonic cause) proved disastrous to any prospect of cooperation for the sake of uncovering the origins of mankind.  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, \u201cthe child prodigy\u201d and the father of modern Egyptology. Champollion, a child prodigy with a knack for solving the unsolveable was greatly impressed with the results of the studies conducted by Young who could now distribute them freely all across the newly peaceful Europe, in spite of de Sacy\u2019s warnings to be weary of the \u201ccharlatane\u201d Champollion. Initially thinking, like so many others, that hieroglyphs were purely ideograms, he was now convinced that the de Sacy\u2013Young phonetic theory could be applied to native Egyptian names as well, something that very few people thought was even remotely possible. Champollion, however, had something was most of his peers did not: familiarity with the Coptic language, which had up until recently been spoken by Egyptian Christians on an everyday basis and was now relegated to the role of a liturgical language. Coptic had been written in a variant of the Greek alphabet for the past 2,000 years but it had to have originated somewhere. Could it have been a descendant of the language the tomb inscriptions for ancient pharaohs were written in? Champollion started browsing through the plethora of drawings the French scientists brought to Egypt by Napoleon in his ill-fated campaign twenty years prior, looking for a cartouche containing a relatively short name which would also include at least one of the Young phonetic hieroglyphs. He finally made his pick:  That cartouche was a very common sight, suggesting it was a name that was popular among various dynasties. Champollion instantly recognized the \u201css\u201d hieroglyph at the very bottom from Ptolemy\u2019s name. He also thought that he recognized the disk at the very top as a representation of the sun. And the old Coptic word for the sun was ra (or r\u0113). So: Ra\u2013?\u2013ss. What could the middle hieroglyph stand for? Champollion got back to the Rosetta Stone inscription and tried to find it there. He did: more than once, actually. Also, anytime it popped out, the Greek text would mention something related to being born. And the Coptic word for offspring was mese. And thus, the cartouche of the pharaoh could be reasonably assume to represent the name Rameses. Which had been attested by Ancient Greek writers as \u03a1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03c5\u03c2 (Ramessus). Champollion was right. The Ancient Egyptians did indicate pronunciation in their hieroglyphs.  All that was left was to combine whatever we knew of old pharaohs\u2019 names with our understanding of Coptic. That is how the hieroglyphs finally opened up, albeit the process continued to be extremely exhausting and challenging. But over the course of the 19th century, we could safely say that we were able to decode an overwhelming majority of the Ancient Egyptian language. We knew their habits and customs, we met their gods, we learned how they perfected the art of preserving their dead and why they buried them with unimaginable treasures. And while the decipherement of the sacred writing did little to provide us with the answer on whether Moses or Joseph actually ever existed, they did open up a whole new world to us\u2014a world not of some Atlanteans of the sands but that of regular people with their daily routines and problems.  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion on a scientific expedition in Egypt some time after he finally cracked the hieroglyphic code. Sadly, in spite of his tremendous contribution, he would not be able to research his beloved Egypt for too long, dying in 1832 at only 42 years of age. All thanks to the tytanical work by the likes of de Sacy, \u00c5kerblad, Young and Champollion, among others that usually go uncredited. And I, as well as anybody who ever tried their luck at the hieroglyphs and realizes how immensely complex this writing system can be, will most definitely bow in respect to these men\u2019s utmost dedication to uncovering our past.
