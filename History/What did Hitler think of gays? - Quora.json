            "answer_text": "Hitler preferred the masculine type of homosexuality, the greek type. He disliked famine homosexuals and send them to the concentration camps. Homosexuality of all kinds exploded in Germany in the late 1800s, and led naturally to the formation of the Nazi Party. Roehm, Hitler, Hess, Goering, Heydrich, and many, many, other leading Nazis were sexually perverted. As a youth, Hitler was a male prostitute in Vienna and Munich. Throughout his life, Hitler surrounded himself with homosexuals, although he was not exclusively homosexual. He engaged in other, even more unspeakable, sexual vices. Hitler's greatest hero was Frederick the Great (1712-1786), a well-known homosexual. Hitler's buddy Roehm, who had to be purged in 1934 because his flagrant sexual excesses were offending the general public, was a homosexual and pederast (molester of young boys). The Nazi Party was founded in Munich in the Bratwurstgloeckl, which just happened to be what today is known as a \"gay bar.\" This was no coincidence because the Party was largely homosexual. Many of its rituals and symbols came from sodomite organizations and individuals, among them the \"Sieg Heil\" salute, the double lightning bolt \"SS\" symbol, and the inverted triangle to identify classes of prisoners in the concentration camps. Indeed, in the perverted atmosphere in the Weimar Republic after the German surrender in World War I, cities like Berlin and Munich were known around the world as capitals where sodomites flocked. In The Arms of Krupp (Boston, Little, Brown, 1968), William Manchester wrote that \"sodomy was delicately known as 'the German vice'.\" (P.232) In Germany's National Vice (London, Quality Press, 1945), Samuel Igra said this: \"In Germany these unnatural vices became a veritable cult among the ruling classes....\" Almost all Hitler's Nazi leaders were sodomites, no doubt because Der F\u00fchrer preferred sodomite companions and co-workers. His closest friends were Ernst Roehm and Rudolf Hess, both homosexuals. Among homosexual Nazi leaders were Baldur von Schirach; Hitler's personal lawyer, Hans Frank; his adjutant Wilhelm Bruckner; His financial adviser Walther Funk, et cetera and so on. And on. Hitler's second-in-command, Hermann Goering, chief of the Luftwaffe, liked to dress up in drag and wear campy makeup. Remember Julius Streicher, the notorious Jew-baiter? He was fired as a schoolteacher following many charges that he was molesting boys. Streicher later became a pornographer. Hitler's chauffeur and personal secretary, Emile Maurice was a sodomite. Reinhard Heydrich, a monster known as the \"blond beast,\" who vowed to exterminate the Jews, became one of Hitler's closest associates, and was another sodomite. The Nazis interned only 5,000-15,000 homosexuals out of 2-3 million German homosexuals.Many of the pink triangleprisoners in Nazi camps were falsely accused of being homosexual. The public pronouncement of Nazis such as Himmler against homosexuals was mere window dressing so as to not advertise the fact the Nazis were riddled with homosexuals. Hitler's fascist dictator friend, Italy's Benito Mussolini, referred to Hitler as \"that horrible sexual degenerate.\". Homosexuality has been termed \"the German vice,\" due to its prevalence in Germany. The sexual perversion of homosexuality easily lends itself to authoritarian impulses. When a society accepts a moral relativistic philosophy (leading to acceptance of homosexuality) it could very well lead to the eventual destruction of our constitutional rights. The authors show that the reason why the Nazis were so anti-semitic had to do with historical reasons. The Jewish culture with its Biblical ethical system was implacably opposed to the macho-gay/warrior mentality that dominated so much of ancient Europe, especially ancient Rome and Greece. These ancient pagan cultures, which glorified sex between warriors, were worshiped by the Nazis who blamed the Jews for the introduction of Biblical morality, which, of course, condemned homosexuality and ended much of the pagan lifestyle in Europe. The basis of any human civilization is a moral and healthy sexual constitution. When sexual morality goes south, God's people are naturally persecuted. And so it is, that the wrath of the Nazis was against those who stood for Bible morality and the sanctity of the family. Nazism was merely a Twentieth-Century revival of ancient Greco-Roman paganism, which exalted homosexuality. In fact, the whole six thousand years of struggle between the forces of good and evil in human history has been one of sexual morality versus sexual immorality. Pagan religions of Egypt, Persia, Carthage, Babylon, and Assyria were all steeped in pederastic (man-boy sex) tradition. Male homosexual temple prostitutes existed in the worship of Ishtar and Astarte in Syria, Babylon, and Canaan, who were the neighbors of the Israelites, and in Crete and Ephesus in the Greek world. The ancient religion of Baal had male cult prostitutes, I Kings 14:24, which is condemned by God, Deuteronomy 23:17. The Roman Empire, which can be considered a type of the Christian holocaust, homosexual sadistic emperors of Rome, tortured and persecuted Christians, who stood for Biblical sexual morality. Fourteen of the first fifteen Roman emperors were homosexual. As the Romans persecuted Christians, so the Nazis persecuted the Jews. The Pink Swastika hits home in explaining the hatred of homosexual occult pagans toward those who stand for Bible morality.We have the same thing developing today in our society.The homosexual movement is diametrically opposed to those who stand for Bible morality.They are dedicated to the destruction of the family and the closing of churches who oppose their agenda.In Germany, the Wandervoegel boys' clubs were breeding grounds for homosexuality prior to the ascent of the Nazis. So today, the Boy Scouts of America are a target of homosexuals. From 1973 to 1993, over 1,416 scout leaders were expelled for abusing boys. There is a juggernaut toward pushing the gay and lesbian agenda... ",

            "answer_text": "As Rudolf Diels recorded: \u201cHe lectured me on the role of homosexuality in history and politics. It had destroyed ancient Greece, he said. Once rife, it extended its contagious effects like an ineluctable law of nature to the best and most manly of characters, eliminating from the reproductive process precisely those men on whose offspring a nation depended. The immediate result of the vice was, however, that unnatural passion swiftly became dominant in public affairs if it were allowed to spread unchecked.\u201d Hitler wasn\u2019t very fond on gays: Starting with R\u00f6hm, Hitler initially protected his previous friend\u2014R\u00f6hm\u2014for a long while, even though he was violating the strong anti-gay order. When Hitler perceived R\u00f6hm to be a threat to his rise to power he changed course. In the Night of long knives in 1934, R\u00f6hm was killed, the murder was justified using R\u00f6hm\u2019s homosexuality for the cause. After standing his concrete stance Hitler then added gays as people to send to concentration camps. Homosexuals were then another group rounded up and deported to concentration camps, to try and alter their orientation, they were included in the: \u201cExperimentation through work\u201d campaign. They wore a pink triangle to indicate, and display what they were. Experiments were done to attempt to make them heterosexual, some say it cured them while others made such claims so that they could be realeased from the camps. Paragraph 175a was a law used to reduce the amount of homosexual actions, and homosexuals in general such things like, a kiss, hug, embrace were not permitted and punishable. Hitler felt gays were against the plan of the \u201cmaster race\u201d. ",
