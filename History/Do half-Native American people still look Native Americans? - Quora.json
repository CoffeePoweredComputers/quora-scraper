            "answer_text": "Depends on what the other half is and the crap shoot that is genetic inheritance. Plus, what people \u201clook like\u201d is highly subjective. I\u2019ve noticed some non-Natives that have a rather rigid notion of this. And if they perceive any non-Native ancestry, then it somehow negates the overall Native \u201clook.\u201d Usually, if the mix is Native-White ancestry, the darker genes are dominant and the person will still be perceived as non-White or \u201cNative-looking\u201d by most people. A smaller minority might inherit more European genes and might fall within the European phenotypic range. Again, this can be rather subjective, anyway. But, if the mix is Native-Black, or Native-Asian then the perception by a wider non-Native population might just see a \u201cBlack person\u201d or an \u201cAsian.\u201d This is because America has a distinct issue with Black blood and the One Drop rule. So, if any African ancestry is perceptible, then that person is just seen as \u201cBlack.\u201d And the child of a 4/4 blood Native and Asian will likely just be perceived as Asian. This is because the features are already rather close. And many Natives already have slight epicanthic folds, or have them outright. So, these mixed offspring usually take on more pronounced epicanthic folds themselves. ",

This may not be accurate but my Ancestry DNA test shows that about 50% of my ancestry is Native American/Indigenous Mexican and I\u2019ve been told I look Native American amongst other things. The only issue with that is the people that tell me probably have never seen a full blooded Indigenous man in their lives and are going off the Native Americans they\u2019ve seen in the USA (a lot of whom are mixed). I have a cousin who tested at 60% Native but he looks white to me so it depends. ",
