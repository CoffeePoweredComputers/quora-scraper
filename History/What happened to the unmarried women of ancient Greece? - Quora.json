            "answer_text": "In ancient Greece, girls, children of citizens attended schools to learn reading, writing, and mathematics, literature, poetry, and music (especially the lyre). Athletics was also an essential element in a young person\u2019s education. Girls were educated in a similar manner to boys but especially on dancing, gymnastics, and musical accomplishment which could be shown off in musical competitions and at religious festivals and ceremonies. The ultimate goal of a girl\u2019s education was to prepare her for her role in rearing a family. A girl\u2019s upbringing could involve an older partner acted as a mentor in educating them as more experienced. Young women were expected to marry as a virgin, and marriage was organized by their father/guardian, who chose the husband and accepted from him a dowry. Married at the typical age of 13 or 14, love may/may not have developed between the couple, but philia - a general friendship/love sentiment; eros, the love of desire, was often sought elsewhere by the husband(Prostitution in ancient Greece - Wikipedia). Of course there existed famous Greek women too. First of all, there was the unmarried woman, Goddess Athena. She was known as Athena Parthenos (\"Athena the Virgin\").  In addition there were many ancient Greek famous women. (Ten Noble and Notorious Women of Ancient Greece).  Ancient Greek Women Who Changed History A great Athenian philosopher, Plato believed that women can rule a society just as well as men. Plato teach that women can show the same spirit and wisdom as men, if obtain the same education, not having the burden of raising children and housework. Plato suggested that the upbringing of children should be done under the supervision of the State. At \u201cLaws\u201d Plato stressed that the State which does not educate women, resembles the man who exercise only one arm. Spartan girls differed to the rest of Greek city-states/kingdoms as they were permitted to exercise outdoors, unclothed, like the Spartan boys, which was impossible in the rest of the Greek world. Spartan women not only exercised, they also participated in athletics. The allowance of exercise and athletics for Spartan women, was looked down upon the highly cultured Ionian Athenians who called Dorian men and women barbarians at times, for their simple cultural manners, Spartans and Macedonians alike. Of course they referred to Greek Barbarians, as both were Olympic God believers speaking a Greek dialect Doric, hence another Greek tribe, even in big competition to Ionian Athenians. Spartans believed that the strong and fit women would reproduce strong warriors. Spartan women were able to fraternize in public with Spartan men. Spartan women along with exercising with the opposite sex, were known for their razor-sharp wit and outspoken natures. They could also own wealth and could defend themselves against a male if they didn\u2019t wish to marry, who they could beat in avoiding the marriage. Slaves, non-Greek (Barbarians: non Olympic Gods believers, speaking a foreign language, mainly referred to Persians) and married women were not allowed to participate in the Olympics. The only married woman who broke the law was Kallipateira, mother of Olympic victors. She trained her son Peisidoros and she dressed as a man to enter the Stadium to watch him competing. After his victory in attempting to enter the field, her clothes fell revealing her female body. However, the Hellanodikai did not punish her, honoring the Olympic victor members of her family. Unmarried women had their special running events, which took place in Olympia in honor of goddess Hera every four years but they were also allowed to watch the mens\u2019 and boys' contests of the festival of Zeus. These games had been established either by Hippodamia in honor of her husband Pelops\u2019 victory over her father Oenomaus or by the sixteen women of Elis that wove the goddess' peplos. At the Heraia, unmarried ladies(divided in age categories) competed, wearing a short robe and having the right shoulder naked to the breast. The winner received the Olympic olive-tree wreath and had the right of a sculpted image with her name at Heraion. Unmarried women also had the right to participate in the Olympic Games in the equestrian events, at which the horse owner was awarded the wreath. The first woman Olympic victor was Spartan Princess Cyniske, daughter of Archidamus, whose horses won in 396 BC. Some other women who won ancient chariot races were Zeuxo, Hermione, Belistiche, Encrateia, and Cassia. Belestiche was from Macedonia(modern times Macedonian region of Greece as North Macedonia was established from Slavs entering the vast Macedonian area much later at Byzantine times, named even later, ending of Ottoman times as Slav Macedonians). It seems that the Dorian (Spartan & Macedon tribe) women, not only gave birth to strong warriors but also were superb athletes themselves.  ",

            "answer_text": "It pains me to say this, it was rather impossible for most respectable families to keep their daughters unmarried. Unfortunately females were more or less treated as cattle by their fathers and most of them made sure to marry them in an age that would qualify their husbands as pederasts by the modern standards. Even worse, the girls from lower classes could end up courtesans or slaves if their family was indebted. Anyway, a reading on the fate of the married women themselves would be enough for most of us to look back with revulsion, but remember, these times were harsh and life expectancy was rather short.
