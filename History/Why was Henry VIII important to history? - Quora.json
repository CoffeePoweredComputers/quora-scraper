            "answer_text": "Why is Henry VIII, King of England famous in history? Apart from being a king, you mean? Well for many it is the wives -Henry VIII and his six wives. Ultimately, it comes down to his six wives, in particular his second wife (and his first). Catherine of Aragon hit an age where she was unlikely to produce more children, without providing a male heir to the throne. Henry had the idea the Anne Boleyn would fix all his problems, but the Pope wouldn't grant him an annulment. Everything Henry is famous, infamous for stems from this. Oh, and being inept in every way and having no clue about money (makes you wonder if he really was Henry VII's son). He also had a real talent for listening to people with their own agenda. To get around his marriage problems, he broke with the Pope and set up the Church of England. This led to the Pilgrimage of Grace, and harsh reprisal and repression. He then listened to the likes of Rich and carried out the Disillusionment of the monestaries. Which are the things he is remembered for, along with having six wives. Annulled, Annulled, Died, Annulled, Beheaded, Survived - so really three wives ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that King Henry Vlll is important because he singlehandedly changed the face of religion by making himself the ruler of the church. He wanted his way by divorcing Catherine of Aragon in order to marry Anne Boleyn. Once the Pope said \u2018no\u2019, he decided that the church would be better off with him running it. Then, Anne didn\u2019t have a son, so, he falsely accused her of sleeping with her own brother and ( was it father or uncle\u2026.I forgot who) and had them killed. So much for baring false witnessing. And for all that he has done to ensure that he had a male heir was for naught because his son died and the crown went to BOTH OF HIS daughters ( who further created havoc when Henry\u2019s son died). Mary decided that anyone not wishing to convert back to Catholicism was brutally murdered. Elizabeth has her cousin jailed and murdered. Basically, he changed the rules to suit himself. ",
