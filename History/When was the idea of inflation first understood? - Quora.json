            "answer_text": "Inflation has been understood for as long as people have been in power. I\u2019m going to recount three interesting examples here. But first, let\u2019s agree on what we define as inflation. Let\u2019s call it a sustained increase in prices, with a corresponding decrease in the real value of money. Whereas you could once buy more with less, now you buy less with more. To Milton Friedman, inflation was \u2018always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\u2019. Unintentionally, my three examples end up supporting Friedman\u2019s view- make of that what you will! The first is Mansa Musa\u2019s trip to Mecca. Musa Keita I (1280\u20131337), the tenth Mansa of the Mali Empire was, amongst other things, super wealthy. Really, really, wealthy, so that by some accounts he\u2019s considered to be the richest person of all time. Now, between 1324 and 1325, Musa made a trip to Mecca, a pilgrimage, so to speak. Musa had an entourage of 60,000 men, all basically drenched in gold bars, gold dust and gold dresses, and 80 camels with about 75 kg of gold dust each. All this gold he threw around and distributed to the poor he met on his journey. All this excess led to a decade of rampant inflation in nearby Egyptian cities, as gold was devalued rapidly. There was so much of it, after all. (Source: Wikipedia) Then, we have the case of medieval monetary debasement. In post-Roman Europe, kingdoms were beginning to form everywhere. Most continued or elaborated upon the Roman coinage system, and rulers - either kings or nobles - controlled mints. Soon enough, those who controlled the mints - and had limited bullion - realized they could gradually diminish the amount of bullion in each coin, while still keeping its value\u2026they were in power, after all. Hence, for example, the King of England could reduce the grams of gold in a pound, but still call it a pound. And still, the currency would lose value over time, because its value was ultimately derived from the gold or silver it had. Debasement nevertheless became a major political/economic tool for monarchs, especially when funding wars. Of course, it also brings in economic instability- it is, after all, voluntary inflation. It has been argued that the Barons\u2019 control over the mints (and the military) was what helped England finance the Hundred Years\u2019 War against France, where it the King (the Dauphin) controlled the mints, and had no reason not to debase. Lastly, we have late medieval Spain, freshly in possession of New World bullion. The biggest outcome of the Spanish conquests in South America wasn\u2019t that Spain now ruled over a major part of the continent. It was that Spain was sitting on top of one of the largest silver mines in history- the Cerro Rico in the Andes, just as it had access to tons of Aztec gold. Unfortunately, bringing so much gold back home had similar consequences to Mansa Musa\u2019s Mecca trip- an unprecedented level of inflation. Spain was plunged into a very chaotic economic climate for decades, from the 1500s on. This may partly explain why it was one of the first imperial powers to lose its colonies - to other empires or to local revolutionaries. So there you have it- three cases of inflation in pre-modern history. However, two of these cases - those of Mansa Musa and imperial Spain - see inflation as an unforeseen consequence. These people, then, didn\u2019t actually understand inflation. And yet, we have a very conscious understanding of inflation with debasement. With England, the monetary structure gave every incentive to the Barons to keep the King\u2019s monetary aspirations in check. After all, they understood the inflationary consequences of debasement. So, long story short: inflation has been \u2018understood\u2019 since at least the 14th century AD. I\u2019d recommend reading even earlier works, such as Chanakya\u2019s Arthashastra, for these would likely deal with inflation as a concept, at a time centuries before the 1300s. ",

            "answer_text": "Inflation is a problem with the value of currency. So the invention of currency had to have occurred first. Money as we know it is only worth anything if people believe that value will be honored consistently and into the future. If a government prints too much money, or does not produce anything the value of its currency will decline. Given the economic policy I see being implemented in various places around the world today, I don't know that is its yet understood. ",
