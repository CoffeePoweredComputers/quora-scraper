            "answer_text": "All hogwash! I think our ancestors were more intelligent individually than any one of us presently alive. Let me demonstrate: Pick any one of our ancestors and put him/her on a desert island for a year. At the same time, pick any one of the present day humans and put him/her on another desert island for a year. Who do you think will have the highest probability of survival after a year? I think you will find that that ancestor of ours has does quite well, in fact he/she might have put on some weight as there was no competition on that island! On the other hand, our present day friend might have died or suffering from severe malnutrition, you name it. So, as far as individual survival is concerned, our ancestor will beat the present day humans hands down. That is called survival called intelligence, without that no other intelligence is worth its weight in neurones. What differentiates us from them is our superiour organisational skills and the collective knowledge we have about the world. Individually, the present day humans are actually imbeciles compared to a hunter gatherer. ",

            "answer_text": "All of these things you\u2019ve described are the product of tools. Math is a tool, tools were used to build things, people were used as tools to build things, etc. Tools, while they are a part of human intelligence, are not the hallmark of modern intelligence. Humans have used tools, well, forever, for lack of a better description. What sets us apart is our ability to have objective realities. In other words, we have science. Most people know why lightning isn\u2019t created by the gods, or why the sun sets and rises everyday, why we have rain, etc. I\u2019ve only talked about weather related things but you must know what I mean. Natural phenomena can now be explained rather than just thought about, and that is what makes us more intelligent, if that\u2019s how you want to describe it. ",
