            "answer_text": "Lenin was dedicated all his life to Marxist politics and its communism aim, as he interpreted it. The defeat of the workers revolution in Russia was peculiar in that this defeat came from the revolutionary forces themselves, it was internal to the program and action of the Bolsheviks. They were state socialists \u2014 with the leadership drawn from the intelligentsia \u2014 and they didn\u2019t really understand adequately that socialism can only be built through mass participation and control by the working class \u2014 the masses of ordinary people. In \u201cThe State and Revolution\u201d Lenin had said that the proletariat needs to smash up the old bureaucratic state in all its components and build a new form of governance. But this is not what the Bolsheviks did. They insisted at the Soviet Congress of October 1917 that a new state cabinet of ministers under control of their leaders be created \u2014 the Council of People\u2019s Commissar. But this was really quite similar in its structure \u2014 and in many of the personnel at various levels \u2014 to the cabinet of ministers under the Provisional government, which had been modeled on the tsarist regime. Each of the positions in the Council of People\u2019s Commissars had control over a \u201ccommissariat\u201d which was like a conventional bureaucratic ministry. They created the new state planning body from above, Supreme Council of National Economy. This was made up of Bolshevik stalwarts, and various bureaucrats and experts. In setting up their regional and industrial planning administration they simply took over the glavki which were the industrial planning bureaucracies of the old tsarist regime. Lenin was totally opposed to the councils being mostly elected by workers. Lenin\u2019s concept of \u201cworker control\u201d never got beyond his idea that worker committees would monitor and maybe check or veto management on certain issues, but there would still be power in the hands of management. Even as late as 1931, Trotsky was still defining \u201cworker control\u201d is this very weak and narrow way. The Bolsheviks seem to have inherited a lot of their programmatic weaknesses from the pre-World War 1 social democratic Marxism. The idea that socialism would be something akin to the German post office \u2014 as Lenin put it in \u201cThe State and Revolution.\u201d So consequently, with their fixation on control through this central state apparatus, they did not emphasize mass participation in control of neighborhoods and workplaces by working class people. This is in fact the key explanation as to why the revolution got consolidated into a bureaucratic ruling class. We don\u2019t have to make any assumptions of personal vices like \u201cbeing power hungry\u201d to explain the outcome. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately for him, Chomsky is almost totally ignorant of Lenin and Leninism. Lenin was no tyrant nor was he a \u2018power-hungry\u2019 opportunist. All his political life he was, like Marx, a supporter of working class power and radical democracy; hence his slogan \u201cAll power to the soviets!\u201d (the soviets were working class factory councils set up after the popular February 1917 revolution). Lenin opposed an insurrection against the hopeless Kerensky regime (that had been set up after the above popular revolution \u2014 and which was ripe for overthrow by a counter-revolution, probably spearheaded by General Kornilov, which would have restored the Tsar) until the Bolshevik Party had won majority support in the soviets. The subsequent October insurrection (old calendar) was an essential move in order to stop the above counter-revolution succeeding, which would have been followed by a bloodbath (like the one that followed the Paris Commune 46 years earlier, when 30,000 men, women and children were summarily executed). The Paris Commune of 1871 The counter-revolution, which began soon after the insurrection, took the form of a civil war, which the Bolsheviks had to fight ruthlessly or face the aforementioned bloodbath. Chomsky ignores this salient fact in his ahistorical criticism of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Apparently, he thinks that harsh language, stern looks and a few letters to the editor would have been sufficient to stop the 13 invading imperialist armies, not to mention the White Army itself.
