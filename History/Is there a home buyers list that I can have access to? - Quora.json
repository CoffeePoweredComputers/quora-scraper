All deeds are recorded and once recorded they are a matter of public record. It just requires a little digging on your part. As you know from living in the area, Georgia is blessed with an abundance of counties so if you really want to get this list you will get very familiar with with the clerks in Fulton, Cobb, Gwinnett, Dekalb, and the other counties that make up Metro Atlanta.
