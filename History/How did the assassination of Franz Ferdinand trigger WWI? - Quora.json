            "answer_text": "The Serbian terrorist organization Black Hand murdered Franz Ferdinand in a bid to prevent him from replacing the aging Emperor Franz Joseph and liberalize the Austria-Hungarian Empire, thus curbing unrest and throwing a wrench in the Serbian territorial aims over Bosnia and Croatia.After receiving promise of backing for any action Austria-Hungary thought reasonable from Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, Austria-Hungary proceeded to present an ultimatum to Serbia relating to the investigation and punishment for the assassination.Despite not being ready for war, Russia proceeded to enact partial mobilization(according to the international understanding tantamount to declaration of war) against Austria to dissuade them from taking arms in the case of Serbian refusal, a move counterproductive to their attempts to make Serbia accept the ultimatum and thus avoid war.Serbia agreed only to a partial acceptance of the ultimatum. As a result, Austria-Hungary declared mobilization against Serbia.Tensed about the situation, Britain placed its navy under war footing.Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.Russia enacted general mobilization.Germany asked France to maintain neutrality in a German-Russian war. France refused and enacted general mobilization. Germany enacted general mobilization.Germany declared war on Russia.Germany requested Belgium to allow German troops passage. Belgium refused. Germany declared war on France and Belgium.Having found the casus belli she was desperately searching for to fight against Germany, Britain declared war on Germany.Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia. The Weltkrieg had truly begun.",

            "answer_text": "When the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie were murdered in 1914 - the Austro-Hungarian government took the opportunity of the horrible murder of the heir to the Hapsburg Empire and his wife, to try and crush Serbia - the murderer was a Serb (and had links with elements of Serbian military intelligence) and Serbia had been anti Hapsburg since the coup in Serbia in 1903. However, this could have been just a Balkan War (there had been several wars in the Balkans) - but the German government (or elements of it) took the opportunity of conflict between Austro-Hungary and Serbia to make a bid to dominate all of Europe, The Germans were seriously concerned about the military modernization of France (due to be finished by 1916) and of Russia (due to be finished to 1918) and by the rapid economic development of Russia. The German academic and military elite decided it was \u201cnow or never\u201d - either they would destroy rival powers now, or they never would destroy them As Germany would never be in a stronger relative position than it was in 1914 - indeed Germany would (relatively speaking) get weaker over time. So the Germans declared war on Russia sending two letters to the Russian government - one saying that Germany was declaring war because of Russian military mobilization (the gesture of support for Serbia which the Czar had agreed to because his ministers shouted at him), but the other letter delivered by the German ambassador said that Germany would declare war even if Russia agreed to change policy. The German Declaration of War upon France was a tissue-of-lies - it even pretended that the French were bombing Bavaria. Having turned a Balkan War into a general European War, the German government then made it a World War - by invading Belgium, thus bringing Britain into the war. And later launching a campaign against the United States - sinking American civilian ships (killing large numbers of Americans), organizing terrorist attacks in the United States itself, and stirring up some Mexicans against the United States. Eventually, 1917, the United States declared war upon Germany. Franz Ferdinand would have hated all of this - he wanted peace. ",

Europe was going through major power shifts both among and within nations for 4 decades before the war began, here are some of the facts - 1. After the first Balkan war in 1912 Russia embarrassed by its inability to protect Serbia start a large scale modernization of its armed forces stating clearly that any conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia it would support the Serbs2. Germany announces that if there were any conflict to arise between Austria-Hungary and Serbia it would side with the German speaking Hapsburg's3. France announces support for Serbia due to a long standing enmity between the French and the Germans 4. England announces support for France I thin this 1914 American cartoon all sums it up, called the chain of Friendship -  The situation was so tense that the German council of war with both wings (there was no Luftwaffe back in those days) sat down and actually discussed the possibility of war in 1912 -1. The Army wanted to strike before Russia completed the modernization of its Armies2. The Navy wanted to wait for another 18 months to build U boat Docks and consolidate its naval fleet to cope with a war with Britain Wilhelm listened to the Navy and the result of the meeting was a resolve to do nothing The Black Hand killing Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his Wife was just the match that lit the fuse on a huge stack of dynamite. Empires had reached a state where peaceful coexistence was no longer possible and the assassination of the Archduke was seen as a direct attack by Serbia on Bosnia ",

            "answer_text": "At the start of WWI much of the world was under the thumb of colonial occupation and/or emperors. Recall Nicholas II, last tsar of Russia, Pu Yi, the last emperor of China, The last emperor of Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm, Sultan Mehmed VI, the last Ottoman emperor, and finally Franz Joseph the last emperor of the Austro-Hungarian empire. They all had something in common\u2014they were all the last acts in the age of empires, which would soon be over. So what happened to archduke Franz Ferdinand, and why is his assassination another \u201cshot heard \u2019round the world\u201d? It would seem that the Serbs found themselves under the control of the Austro-Hungarian empire and they weren\u2019t too happy about it. They agitated for self-determination and kicked up enough of a fuss that Franz Joseph sent the archduke and his wife to Serajevo to inspire unity. While parading through the streets, the archduke and his wife were shot and killed by a group calling themselves \u201cThe Black Hand\u201d\u2014and here\u2019s where his death is said to spark WWI. Naturally, the Austro-Hungarian empire was furious and demanded that the Serbs turn over the terrorists responsible for the assassination. The ultimatum was delivered 30 days after the assassination and the Serbs were given 48 hours to produce the conspirators. The Serbs either could not\u2014or would not\u2014deliver, but perhaps more importantly, a web of complex alliances was kicked into gear because of this threat. The Russians recognized a kinship with the Serbs because both spoke Slavic languages. The Russians promised their armed support in any event that threatened the Serbs. Here was just such a threat and it caused the unprepared Tsar to mobilize. This alliance was just one of many on the continent that would soon be moved to war as nations and empires mobilized under this complex web of agreements. When the Russian Tsar mobilized his ill-equipped peasant army, it caused the German empire\u2014under the rule of the Tsar\u2019s own cousin\u2014to declare war. Militarized nations, trapped by alliances and imperial tendencies, acted on their growing nationalistic ideals\u2026.and the rest is, well, history. It was an unfortunate chain of events sparked by a challenge to authoritarian rule. The conditions were ripe so it is probable that any number of events could have touched off the mobilization of troops\u2014and WWI. At the end of WWI the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, Chinese, and Ottoman Empires would collapse. It was bound to happen, regardless of the first victim. ",

            "answer_text": "The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was a pretext for WWI. The major European powers at the time were mostly in harmony. The Royal houses associated with these nations were joined together through marriage via the children and grandchildren of Britain\u2019s Queen Victoria. Two events happened at the end of the 19th century, the death of Queens Victoria and a united Germany under Prussia. The harmony between the royal families began to wane. Second, Germany under Bismarck began to evolve into a major world power. While Germany was disunited prior to the rise of Prussia and Bismarck\u2019s influence, Britain and FRance were will to turn a blind eye toward their actions within Germany. It was France\u2019s defeat by Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War, that brought Germany\u2019s military to the attention of Britain. Second, Germany while it was disunited did not have any colonies. By the time Germany united, it was late coming to the European colonialism table. Germany quickly realized that it need a powerful navy, if it was to be seen as a major power and have a colonial empire. Germany started on a massive building of a fleet that could be equal to Britain\u2019s Royal Navy. The British became alarmed at Germany\u2019s progress in building a fleet and its threat to the Royal Navy and Britain\u2019s overseas colonies. This was one of the underlying factors that led the British to declare war on Germany. The other was France seeking revenge for it defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. The Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was the excuse to make things happen and not the major reason. ",

            "answer_text": "The Great War\u201d / \u201cWWI\u201d - Good Q - why?: I like the 1st Q responder\u2019s, \u201chomework time\u201d. Yes exactly because others like me have difficulty matching the reasons for this war vs the terrible human losses & come up short in that reasonable logic process using much of the reasoning laid out by historians. There is huge INet material to draw from for an almost endless forever, \u201cA\u201d. It is easy to write a book of information & difficult to concisely present the basic cause. But here is my concise opinion: \u201cThe Great War was abt economics & ethnic nationalism.\u201d That\u2019s it if you don\u2019t want to waste time reading more on this statement. I\u2019d like to stop here but it leaves the reader hanging in mid air. So first \u2018Economics\u2019: Britain\u2019s economic system was based substantially on harvesting resources from its vast colonial empire. It became frightened at an emerging Germany economic power, maybe a superpower which was trying to emulate the successful British empire colonial economics, so had begun forming German colonies. Britain had been almost unopposed for centuries at European empire economics. Probably most of us have seen the typical upper class British on TV series not working, sitting in their parlor waiting for the suitor to come, who have investments that pay \u201cX\u201d amt of money annually, based on money generated in colonial trade. Re: Recall why the American colonists were unhappy w/ mother Britain? Well this upstart Germany got into WWI based on treaties, as did most or all the other antagonist that eventually were in \u201cThe Great War\u201d. The war could have stopped then by some reasonable leaders, but my opinion is they saw at least two things: 1) 1st economics: stop Germany from becoming a World trade competitor in competition w/ their own colonial empire from which to harvest vast colony resources just exactly as Britain was doing. That frightened the investing British upper crust sitting in those parlors waiting for the suitor who also was frightened for his own economic prospects at a competing market oriented German nation of energetic hard working people competing w/ merchant Britain & the idle rich w/ their annual investment incomes. Re: this website: < World War I: The Real Reason the Great War Happened > which sees my explanation very differently but actually agrees w/ me totally just a different speculated conclusion. 2) 2nd reason, ethnic nationalism> the German people had endured Roman invasions, wars, massive slavery, subjugations, & occupation of their lands between current Germany & Italy for centuries & were unable to regain it indefinitely from time to time, including Gaul (France) & also Iberia. Iberia after a couple of the earliest migration waves of early \u2018Out-of-Africa\u2019 migrants, 1st from east of Iberia via the land route north of the Mediterranean from Arabia thru Eastern Europe, & 2ndly less than 8 miles across the Mediterranean between Morocco & European Gibraltar. Later Iberia was additionally settled by the German Suebi Tribe. Digressing, for the Quora genealogists who wonder why their genealogy test show they have migration route DNA tested relatives in Iberia, is because they are probably genetically related to the German Suebi Tribe. What the Germans wanted 1) pre-WWI in other earlier wars, a) in WWI & b) later in WWII was to absorb into a greater & earlier Germany, the \u2018majority German populated regions\u2019, like the Sudetenland, etc.. My point is the German participation in WWI was 1st to re-unite the majority Germanic peoples into one nation on the European land mass. And 2nd to further its economic interest doing exactly what Britain had done via colonial empire, obtain inexpensive colony resources & manufacture them into a finished product. Britain feared this competition, therefore destroy Germany was the reason Britain got involved in this totally unnecessary war & drug the US into it via President Wilson. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, here's the deal: Serb terrorist kills F. Ferdinand in a restless AH province of Bosnia. AH, which has had lots of little pinpricks from renegade Serbs from the neighboring country, (who want to pry Bosnia away, cause lots of Serbs live there too) decides this is a perfect time to teach the nosy neighbors a lesson by invading them. Unfortunately, the little neighbors have a big bad relative living on the other side of the neighborhood--Russia. Now AH wants to kick some Serb hiney, but are afraid they cant stand up to cousin Russia\u2026.so what to do? AH also has a big bad cousin living in the neighborhood--Germany. Right, they say, we'll get our cousin to threaten Serbia's cousin, they will stand glowering at each other, while we make hay with the Serbs. When they go to Germany, the Germans say okay. (They figure to stand glowering at the Russians while little cousin AH whips up on the Russians' cousin Serbia. Big brownie points for them and all they have to do is look tough. No problem.) So\u2026it all goes according to plan. For a little while. AH throws down insulting terms to Serbia\u2026who quietly accepts(except for 1 minor point). Everybody says, well that is it--no war. Except AH, which says we're having a war no matter what, and throws the first punch(bombarding the Serb capital, Belgrade). Now what? Russia and Germany publicly puff up at each other(privately try to figure out how to stop all this without actually fighting each other). And Russia calls in another neighbor--France. Now France is actually a neighbor on the opposite side of the street from Germany. She has an agreement with Russia: Germany attacks you, we'll hit them from behind. Ditto for Russia if Germany attacks France. Germany has a problem: TWO tough guys, one on each side. Russia decides it cant let its cousin Serbia get beaten up(makes the family look bad), so they roll up sleeves to take a swing at AH. Germany says back off, or else. Everybody is stripping down, ready to rumble. Now Germany has a plan for dealing with this 2 on 1 situation. They think France is quicker on her feet, while Russia is powerful but slower of the mark. If they can sucker punch France--put her down quick--then turn on Russia, they reckon they can pull it off. So\u2026they start the fight by laying into France(who, by the by, has a British friend helping her out. They knock her down, but she staggers up and manages to land a punch that backs Germany off and gives Russia a chance to climb into the ring. From now on, we have a full on, knock down, drag out, no holds barred, fight. That's how WWI started. ",

            "answer_text": "Ferdinand assassination is only the first World War, and the war is already in process preparation. At the end of nineteenth Century, the major capitalist countries in Europe for hegemony and segmentation of colonial struggle, has formed two rival military aggression group, namely Germany, Austria, Italy and France and Russia alliance agreement. In twentieth Century, the rapidly growing Germany demanded a new world division, threatening the old colonial powers such as Britain and france. Germany's plan to build a Baghdad railroad directly violated Britain's interests in West Asia, North Africa and India. The German aggression plan in Africa and the dumping policy in South America are also in sharp conflict with britain. Germany actively strengthened the Navy and tried to compete with Britain for maritime supremacy. The struggle between Britain and Germany in colonial, commercial and armaments areas strained relations between the two countries. Germany's strong, so that Europe's \"balance of power\" was broken, the British had to abandon the traditional \"glorious isolation\" policy, the adjustment of foreign relations. In January 1902, Britain and Japan signed a treaty of alliance, off the hands of the Japanese, weakening their European rivals russia. At the same time, Britain was also on the European continent looking for its close rival, france. [1] Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo to promote the event by the war of two military group. Austro Hungarian militarists shouted, \"drew swords, aimed at Serbia\", and completely destroyed the Austro Hungarian obstacles to the balkans. A newspaper in Vienna wrote: \"for six years, we've been waiting for all the serious tensions to erupt.\"...... We want war, because that's the faith of our people. Our ideal can be achieved only through a war, in a radical and abrupt manner: This is a powerful Austro Hungarian empire.\" The day after the incident, the Austro Hungarian Army chief of staff Hurt Sjeng Dov and foreign minister Behi Dold said: \"to resolve the problem of Serbia time requirements for military mobilization immediately declared war on Serbia. But they were also worried about Russian intervention, so they asked William to help. ",

            "answer_text": "It didn't. By that, I mean there are so many other more important factors to what caused World War I that many historians and political scientists regard it as absurd to equate the death of the heir of a dying, now- insignificant empire (only in name) to being the single cause, or even primary cause, of World War I. There are so many other causes to the conflict that are far, far more long-term and had way more influence on the conflict than the Archduke's death. German unification and the loss of France in warNow, this one is a prime reason for why France would enter a conflict against Germany. Germany united for the first time in 1871. Prior to that, Germany was nothing more than a tiny set of weak individual nations that all appealed to the European powers on both sides of it for authority. In other words, the Germanic states were all once tiny nations all bunched up, separating eastern and western Europe. However, when Germany united, which itself is another interesting story totally separate from World War 1, it become an economic and military powerhouse. To help demonstrate it's new power, and partly to get some revenge on how it was treated by the main European powers, Germany guaded France, led by Napoleon III at the time, intonation conflict where the French were decimated and absolutely embarrassed. German might had been demonstrated and, since then, the French wanted revenge. 2. Greman Defiance of Britain This one is another interesting story. Once Germany reunited, one of the things it focussed on was trying to create a colonial empire and thus also building up its navy. This was partly done because Kaiser Wilhelm I admired the British Navy at a young age. So, when the Germans began building up its navy and taking over the few colonies still available to the European powers, this pissed off many rising powers at the time and prominent powers there too. Most of all was Britain. This led Britain to create numerous secret alliances, particularly an interesting one with France despite the two being military and economic rivals for thousands of years prior. 3. Secret Alliances Prior to World War I, the numerous powers in existence at the time made many secret alliances with each other. France, Britain and Russia were one alliance, the Entente Powers. Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy made another alliance. These were very secret alliances that made the Europeans distrust each other and try to shift nations to their sides more and more. Germany, for example, made appeals to Czarist Russia on numerous occasions for a secret alliance and it shifted time and again to and away the favor of the Germans. 4. Shoddy Leadership at Best The leadership of the time was very, very bad. The current leader of Austria-Hungary was essentially senile. Kaiser Wilhelm made a very stupid choice of removing Otto von Bismark from his position. That's the equivalent of Congress removing George Washington from the Presidency. Just something that is so absurd to do. Otto von Bismark was a master manupilator and diplomatic tactician who helped establish the legitimacy of the Second Reich prior to and after its official date of reunification. Removing him from a position of power is one of the most idiotic things a leader could have done. Czar Nicholas II was also insanely stupid, as were many of his predecessors who failed to solve the prevalent problems in Russia at the time. 5. Cultural Ties and Nationalism Prior to entering the war and as it was being declared and begun being fought, Europeans on all sides envisioned a quick war that would prove whichever group to be superior. Propaganda at the time spread the message of [insert ethnic/national group] being better than whoever they were fighting. Meanwhile, the Balkan region was full of numerous ethnic groups and nationalities that all conflicted with one another. Serbia's citizens, for example, showed widespread support for the Black Hand that was responsible for the death of the Archduke, particularly since Serbia had just gained independence prior only to have it be taken away by the Austria-Hungarians. In Greece too, for example, violence against Turks living there was also widespread while the Ottoman Empire, in retaliation, killed many Greeks in its Empire. In fact, the Armenians were also genocided by the Ottoman Empire and in Czarisg Russia, violence against non-Orthodox Christians and non-Russians was at an all-time high for the time period. In fact, Russia came to the aid of Serbia precisely because of its Eastern European Slavism, where the Russians saw themselves as \u201cBig Brother\u201d guarding the much smaller, weaker nations of Eastern Europe. 6. Finally, we get to Archduke Francis Ferdinand Remember when I said that the current leader was essentially senile? Well, imagine yourself as a member of the Austria-Hungary government. You love your country but cannot stand your current leader. However, a new leader is going to come along to make things better. He is even trying to work with those Serbs and visit their capita- oh god, he was killed! Yeah, you'd be kinda pissed off. Which is how the few Austria-Hungarians at the time who still saw the Empire as a legitimate force - many of whom were in positions of power due to their loyalty - when their heir was killed. They were pissed off and wanted nothing more than revenge. When they made their ultimatum to Serbia, they knew they were going to war (they made huge demands), but what they didn't take into account was a global conflict, all for this tiny piece of land that nobody except maybe the Austria-Hungarians and the Russians cared about\u2026 why, something else had to cause the war\u2026 Well, I did name quite a few major reasons in this answer.

In fact, a European or worldwide conflict being caused by their actions was likely the furthest thing from their minds when they planned the assassination, or undertook it.Why? They weren\u2019t particularly worldly - Gavrilo Princip and his merry band (and their leaders in the Black Hand Serbian nationalist organization) were not well-traveled and spent the majority of their lives in and around their homeland. The outside world wasn\u2019t something that influenced their thinking.They specifically stated that their aims were limited - Serbian freedom and expansion into Bosnia-Herzegovina to protect ethnic Serbians were their explicit aims. Beyond that, they clearly had no concept.They lived in a world where their perspective was going to be limited - While we in the 21st century take it for granted that we have access to news from around the world, 100 years ago, the majority of people knew about events in their general area and not much more. The concept of their actions creating a greater a conflict would be as alien to them as if in our own time, we thought that an event here on Earth would cause an interstellar war.The assassination itself in the end didn\u2019t cause the war to begin - Historical records demonstrate that the assassination was only a minor blip on the collective radars. In fact, it barely made headlines outside of Austria-Hungary after it occurred. What caused the conflict was and endless series miscalculations and intentional acts of stupidity on the part of leaders in Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia and France with Great Britain not playing a stronger role in trying to defuse the tension. Even if the assassination hadn\u2019t occurred, war in Europe was inevitable as the tensions and preconceptions required for it were already extant.",

            "answer_text": "Technically, it was simply the best excuse that everyone had at the time, to start a major attempt at asserting territorial domination to their own best interests. While epically famous due to his assassination and subsequent infamy, in life he was a minor member of the Austrian royal family. To put it in perspective, it would be like the U.S. declaring war on China because an Asian immigrant shot the Speaker of the House. Not that he wasn\u2019t important to some degree, but not exactly the best reason to start something of the magnitude that it did. By the way, the assassin who got it done was the backup guy. The first attempt happened minutes before when several hand grenades, possibly home made, were tossed in the direction of the open motor car carrying the Archduke and his wife, Sofia. While shaken by the incident, the failure of the attempt emboldened the motorcade to proceed. In frustration, the final assassin, Gavril Princeps, a disenfranchised 20 something Serbian militant, jumped on the running board of the moving car and shot the Duke in the throat as well as striking his wife with several rounds. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The assassination was planned and carried out by members of a secret organization which was almost certainly acting as a proxy for the Serbian government, or for elements thereof. Two of the weaker Great Powers, Austria-Hungary and Russia, became involved immediately. Austria-Hungary sent the Serbs an ultimatum which was consciously written to be defied \u2014 that is, it contained terms no government could submit to. The Serbs appealed to Russia and the Russians felt obligated to respond. Had it ended there, the world would have long forgotten the Umpteenth Balkan War. Bur it did not. All the Great Powers had, over tye last few decades, enmeshed themselves in alliances and counter-alliances. As a consequence of this, Germany came in on the side of Austria-Hungary and then France came in on the side of Russia. And even then, had it gone no further, this would probably be remembered as a big but not absolutely devastating war. The world would have probably gone on essentially unchanged afterwards. But then Germany invaded Belgium to get to France and that brought the world's preeminent power, Great Britain. And after that, it had to be the biggest war ever. So the short answer is, Balkan diplomacy and the alliance system. ",

Austria-Hungary thought that Serbia\u2019s political offensive against it would destabilize their ramshackle empire, and was eager to destroy Serbia from 1913 onward. Look at the list of demands A.-H. made on Serbia in 1914: almost all are concerned with Serbia\u2019s political activities. Then read about Franz Ferdinand\u2019s funeral. A.-H. really didn\u2019t give a damn about his murder. The other war that started was the Great War. Germany was looking to become predominant in Europe, and to take out Russia before it got too powerful. The Germans pretended to want peace, but egged A.-H. on to declare war against Serbia, then encouraged Russia to mobilize against A.-H. so they would have an excuse to go to war. The Chief of the General Staff had been pushing for war for years. Only the Kaiser\u2019s hesitancy, and the Navy\u2019s, had kept war from breaking out sooner (the Kaiser was a little to smart to be eager for war; the German Navy wanted the wanted the Kiel Canal deepening project finished before the balloon went up; the canal was finished in the spring of 1914, and the Kaiser was then conned into declaring war).

After Ferdinand's assassinations Austro-Hungary put ultimatum to Serbia with 10 demands. Serbia accepted 9 of 10, and that was enough for A-H to declare war.

But they attacked through Belgium,which had protection from UK,so now UK also joined war against Germany.

There have literally been thousands of books and articles written about what happened in those few months\u2014including Barbara Tuchman\u2019s Pulitzer-Prize winning The Guns of August\u2014so instead of giving an in-depth discussion, let me list many of them: A continent armed to the teeth as it had not experienced a major/protracted war in a century (the Crimean War, Wars of German and Italian Unification, and the Franco-Prussian War were pretty small in scope and/or duration).A belief that modern technology would make any war short and relatively bloodless (all because the Franco-Prussian War had been that way and military thinking is that you prepare for the next war by looking at the last one; that \u201clast one\u201d should have been the American Civil War).Growing domestic unrest over the rise of socialism/communism, continued distribution of wealth to the upper classes, challenges to the existing social and religious order, and for Britain troubles with Ireland wanting home rule.Rivalries between Britain/France with Germany over the latter\u2019s desire for an overseas empire of its own; the Germans came late to the party, so there was far less land to claim\u2014primarily in Africa\u2014and thus more tension over what was left.Two defensive alliances in the form of the Triple Alliance (Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary) and the Triple Entente (Britain, France, Russia) that seemed bent on collision at some point (Italy would remain neutral at the outbreak of World War I and would actually enter the war later on the side of the Allies, as it had territorial ambitions/disputes with Austria-Hungary).Behind-the-scenes intrigue of a diplomatic sort, most famously Austria-Hungary secretly agreeing to support Russian access to the Mediterranean via the Dardanelles in exchange for Russian support of their own annexing of Bosnia-Herzegovina, only for AH to back out once they\u2019d gotten what they wanted.Intense opposition from Serbia over this annexation as it thought that it should have dominion over BH, leading to the creation of the Black Hand nationalist group that would assassinate the Archduke.A series of set-in-stone war plans that had unwittingly set up Europe like dominoes so that in the wake of Franz-Ferdinand\u2019s murder, the triggering of one led to the triggering of all the others.In reality, the rest of Europe was not that concerned about the death of the Archduke; in fact, he was an outcast from his own family for marrying beneath his station. And had the above conditions not existed in Europe at the time, chances are that this episode would have been a mere footnote in history. But the continent was ready to explode in 1914, and even such a minor event as this could set it off. And it did. ",

            "answer_text": "World War I Should Have Only Been the 3rd Balkan War by Irving Silverman (my opinion only).  I have been asked by some people from the Balkan\u2019s to write about a war that that is not only important in their history but ultimately also in the history of the world. In reality World War I did not start by itself, it was in actuality the start of what would have been the 3rd Balkan War. Here is my brief summation of what happened.  The First Balkan War was started when Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Montenegro decided to form an alliance, The Balkan League, to counter the growing threat of the Ottoman Empire (Turkey). This was an amazing feat of diplomacy considering how much hatred had existed between some of these Balkan nations. An example would be the constant border disputes between Bulgaria and Serbia over control or division of Macedonia. The partition agreement was finally brokered by Russian diplomats who convinced these two opponents that Turkey was a bigger threat and they should unite against that empire. There was a determination that they had to have a determined response to the Turks and The Balkan League agreed to take the offensive to their enemies. On March 13, 1912, Serbia and Bulgaria signed a treaty where they agreed to give northern Macedonia to Serbia, and southern Macedonia to Bulgaria. The two also discussed a war against Austria as well as Turkey if Austria tried to intervene. In May 1912, Greece and Bulgaria signed a similar treaty threatening use of military actions against Turkey. Montenegro was then added to the league through an informal arrangement with Bulgaria and Greece, and a treaty with Serbia concluded in September 1912. On October 8, 1912, Montenegro declared war against the Turks, and 10 days later the rest of the Balkan League joined the war. After just under a month of heavy fighting Turkey had been pushed back so far that all they could do was try and defend Constantinople. Albania, Epirus, Macedonia and Thrace were now controlled by the Balkan States. Serbia had also reached the Adriatic Sea at Durazzo, which gave them an important sea port. Before this Serbia was a land locked nation that needed a place where they could get supplies that did not have to come through central Europe. Both Austria and Italy were opposed to this acquisition because they feared that a Serbian port on the Adriatic would ultimately become a Russian port for the Czarist Empire. Also, Austria and Italy could not allow this because it might threaten the Hapsburg Monarchy(the Austrian /Hungarian Empire) of which they were a key part. While there were still battles going on at Adrianople, Scutari, and Janina they agreed to an armistice during a peace conference at London in December, 1912. But these negotiations were quickly brought to a close when a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat occurred at Constantinople by some Turkish military officers who were determined to continue the war. While the war was resumed in the spring of 1913 it did not last very long; The Treaty of London ended the First Balkan War on May 30, 1913. The Turks were forced to give over to the Balkan League all possessions in Europe from Enos on the Aegean Sea to Midia on the Black Sea, with the exception of Albania. The major nations of Europe friendly to the Balkan League began to draw the new border of the Albanian State and Turkish sovereignty over Crete was withdrawn and it was united with Greece.  The Treaty followed with a dispute over the spoils of war and caused the Second Balkan War. Greece and Serbia began to conspire an agreement that would split Macedonia leaving Bulgaria out of the picture. Because Bulgaria had suffered the most from the 1st war they felt that they should not be left out. Bulgaria attacked Greece and Serbia. But when the Turks and the Romanians attacked Bulgaria that nation quickly agreed to the Treaty of Bucharest and the biggest victory was by Greece which acquired the important ocean port of Salonica. This left a major resentment through Serbia that they were not treated right had still held a hatred towards the Austrian-Hungarian Empire so they made a treaty with Russia to give Serbia some feeling of strength. This also gave many Serbians the idea that they should become independent from that empire. On the morning of June 28, 1914, while traveling in a motorcade through Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Archduke Francis Ferdinand and members of his family were assassinated by a Serbian nationalist. The Archduke had ignored warnings of a possible assassination plot and decided to tour the capital on the anniversary of the 1389 battle of Kosovo. This battle was a humiliating collective memory for all Serbs, in which Serbia was defeated by the Turks, ending Serbia's independence as a nation. This tour was ill advised but he insisted on going to stand up to the rising tide of Serbian nationalism.  The Archduke was chiefly chosen as a prime target because of Serbian fears that after he would acquire the throne, he would continue the persecution of Serbs living within the Austro-Hungarian empire. Serbia had gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878 and no longer wanted to belong to another nation. At that time, Serbia laid claim to several regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina which were inhabited primarily by Serbs. However, the Congress of Berlin granted permission to Austria-Hungary to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the disputed Serbian areas. In 1908 the Austrian-Hungarian Empire officially annexed all of occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina, adding additional fuel to the fires of Serbian nationalism which put a scare to Imperial Russia that they might get dragged into the next war. This assassination of course made Austria declare war against Serbia in 1914 which forced Russia to prepare to come to Serbia\u2019s defense which then caused Germany to declare war to help Austria which then brought France and Britain into the war against Germany and that 3rd Balkan War was now the start of World War I. There was no turning back now and this was now more than just a border dispute between some rival growing nations with a desire for independence. ",

            "answer_text": "World War I is interesting as there are several factors to consider when discussing the root cause of the conflict. The deep causes of World War I can be reduced to four distinct factors: (1) the multipolar structure of the international system, (2) the rise of nationalism, (3) the cult of the offensive, (4) the rise of Germany as a regional power. The immediate causes can be reduced to 3 factors: (1) the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, (2) global competition over colonies, and (3) fights over control of the Balkans following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The best theoretical explanation of World War I is that it was the result of chain-ganging, i.e., that type of alliance behavior characterized by hyperactive balancing in the form of an unconditional alliance in which State A chains itself to State B, and though its reckless, State B\u2019s survival is seen as indispensable to the security of the alliance as a whole. This is most likely true because from a geopolitical perspective, chain-ganging is most likely to occur in situations where the offensive is perceived to have an advantage over defensive posturing, and it\u2019s common in situations involving a multipolar distribution of power. The alliance dynamics of chain-ganging magnify local disputes, and it makes conquest look easy, leading to the misperception that if State A doesn\u2019t defend or support State B right away, State B will be conquered. In other words, it increases the likelihood for minor disputes to spiral into full-scale war. Another possible causal factor of World War I can be termed the security dilemma caused by the modernization and expansion of Germany\u2019s navy in the first decade of the 20th century. This growth threatened British dominance at sea and led Great Britain to enter a series of alliances, (effectively forming the Triple Entente), and construct the HMS Dreadnought which further accelerated the naval arms race between Great Britain and Germany (culminating in the German navy\u2019s destruction at the Battle of Jutland).

            "answer_text": "The murder of Archduke Ferdinand was not the reason (far less than a key reason) of WWI. It was simply the trigger. There were several reasons. The most important ones revolved around the competition for markets and resources among the Great Powers. If you notice the battle lines formed, you had 2 naval Empires (England and France both had significant holdings and colonies) allies with Russia (who did not need any holdings to have enough of a market and resources) and on the other side you had 2 Empires with a huge presence in Europe but little to no holdings overseas (Germany and Austria-Hungary). The Central Powers do have an ally with a small (comparably to the Great Powers) colonial Empire (the Ottoman Empire) but at that point it was merely a matter of alliances and relations, since the Ottoman Empire was already targeted by the great Naval Powers for being dismantled and divided among them (as did happen in the end). There were also some political reasons (French Revancism for the defeat in 1871 (Thank you Preston Schmitz for the correction) and the loss of Alsace-Lorainne for example), along with practical border issues and the emergence of Nationalism. Even though each of these issues could have been individually tackled and solved, they all together boiled into WWI. The murder of Archduke Ferdinand left most of the combatants completely indifferent. But it was the trigger that allowed Austria-Hungary to declare on Serbia, Russia to back Serbia, Germany to back Austria, France to back Russia, Germany to invade Belgium, England to back Belgium\u2026 well the rest is literally History.

His goal was to free Bosnia from the hated Austrian and unite the southern slavs into a new country which later became Yugoslavia. However, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was the spark that set WWI into motion.  Austria-Hungary started making demands on Serbia.  Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany gave Austria-Hungary his support to invade Serbia.  Once Serbia was invaded, then a series of treaties were activated.  1st, Russia came to Serbia's defense by declaring war on AH.  Then Germany declared war on Russia.  This caused France to declare War on Germany.  When Germany invaded Belgium on their way to France, that brought the United Kingdom into the war due to their treaty with Belgium.   The war was preceded by a military build up in Germany and England.  Germany was the economic powerhouse of Europe and wanted to challenge England's dominance of the seas.  The problem with an arms race is that eventually, a country wants to put their military to use.  All of the counties thought this would be a short war but were grossly unprepared for the advances in battlefield technology. ",

The foreign minister of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy, Leopold Berchtold, was obsessed with the Balkans, and particularly Serbian territorial expansion. He had worked for many years to maintain the status quo in the Balkans, and (justifiably) feared the effect of \u201cGreater Serbia\u201d nationalism, which sought to absorb the Balkan peninsula. While Mr. McKeen has described how it became a disastrous world war, his response doesn\u2019t account for the particular tensions between Berchtold and the Serbians. The government of Serbia were not controlled by the Greater Serbia nationalists, and they didn\u2019t want war with Austro-Hungary. They accepted every humiliating term that Berchtold insisted upon, but by then he was obsessed with a war to end the Serbian threat. He insisted that Austrian investigators be given free reign in Serbia, and that Austrian courts be set up in Serbia. That was the equivalent of a complete surrender of Serbian sovereignty, and at that point, the Serbs refused. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is the assassination of Franz Ferdinand considered the start of World War I? It\u2019s not by everyone. But for those who consider so, it comes simply from the imperial situation of all major belligerents at the time, and a will to rehabilitate Austria and Germany which was trendy during the Cold-War and remained so today, and demonize the Orthodox Slavs because as Bismark taught us, there\u2019s nothing better than a common enemy (the Serbs and Russians, and now the Jihadist \u201cGlobal terror\u201d, to keep everyone in line on one\u2019s side (aka. the U.S led NATO). Back to our 1914 Empires, Russia, but also of course Austria-Hungary, Germany, France, the U.K, and even the U.S.A had imperial possessions at the time. And Bosnia was an imperial holding of Austria after being an imperial holding of the Ottoman Empire. Blaming a small Orthodox Slav nation like the Serbs : for a war that was started by an Austro-Hungarian telegram to Belgrade,after Belgrade complied to 90% of the Austrian ultimatum made against Serbiawhich came as a \u201cresponse\u201d to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by a Bosnian Serb pro-Yugoslav militant helped by a rogue organization in Serbia, the Black Hand,of which possible plans (attacking the Archduke in Sarajevo Vienna was warned against by Belgrade who wanted to discourage Vienna to send him there for his own protection and precisely avoid a conflict that Serbia didn\u2019t need after 2 Balkan Wars in the two previous yearsis a good way to disculp the other factions involved in the war (which actually gave it its World-wide dimension for their own ambitions, beyond the treaties that tied them together on each side), may it be on the side of the Entente, may it be on the side of the central-Empires. Hence do so nowadays toward their modern nation-States iteration, blaming instead on nationalism the misdeeds of imperialism, of which said modern nation-States of former imperial Powers are still by the ways adept of, economically speaking, toward the rest of the World, and themselves as vassals of the current American \u201cglobal Empire\u201d. As a nation which was massively targeted by both the losers of both World Wars (Austria and Germany), their local proxies (Croats, Bosnian Muslims, and Albanians), but also its former allies (The U.S.A, the U.K, France), for all those countries are now rolling together against the Orthodox Slavs, the Serbian nation is of course the perfect culprit to revise a bit history, and give a better outlook to both Austria and Germany while pinpointing Serbs and Russians as \u201cthe real enemies, and initial troublemakers anyway\u201d. In short, always remember this grid of lecture / approximate equation : Catholics and protestants both vs Orthodox Christians + Germanic tribes vs Slavic tribes + Western capitalist societies against Eastern socialist, then post socialist ones (a the exception of those swearing allegiance, and even so : they are used and can be sacrificial lambs (Baltic countries, Bulgaria at least)) = (somehow) former Western imperial powers nowadays part of the NATO American Empire (and their local proxies) against Orthodox Slavic post-socialist countries non aligned on that Empire. This story started somehow almost 1,000 years ago, its expression changed over time until the current one, and this ain\u2019t over yet. Rewriting History is part of that war for a very long time, and is rabidly done by the triumphant West for the sake of both its conscience and its legitimacy to do whatever it is doing right now (dismantling Serbia, trying to suffocate Russia).

Serbia escaped blame by recruiting as assassins Serbs from Bosnia.As expected Austria blamed Serbia, for it had a history of provoking Austria. In retaliation for Austria\u2019s invasion of Serbia, Russia and France mobilized secretly. Learning of this Germany invoked its defensive plan, which called for a neutralizing France quickly and then turning to deal with the larger \u201cRussian steamroller.\u201dThe archduke\u2019s assassination, which provoked the war, was followed by another assassination in Paris, which covered up France\u2019s involvement in the war planning,Germany did not want a two-front war and Kaiser Wilhelm II tried to avoid it.

It did nothing to move the vacillating Kaiser toward peace.

At that point the war became general. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it was. It was the straw, that broke the camels back, so to speak. What they don\u2019t tell you in history class & documentaries about WW1, is that it was the latest incident in a long line of provocations by Serbia (among other a lot of other factors, which contributed to France, Russia and Britain joining into an otherwise limited, regional conflict). Let\u2019s start with this incident: The group, which armed Gavrilo Princip (the shooter) and his fellow would-be assassins (there was an attempt prior that day, plus there were several more shooters/bomb throwers along the route when the attempt was successful), was known as Young Bosnia. The name is ironic, as both Princip and the majority (if not all) of the members were Serbs living in Bosnia, rather than Bosnians (and their act was NOT popular, as there was a severe anti-Serb riot that followed the assassination), and they didn\u2019t strive for an independent Bosnia, but rather for a Bosnia (and Herzegovina, Croatia & Dalmatia, etc.) under Serb overlordship. Young Bosnia was a sub-group of the \u201cblack hand\u201d, an organization funded, armed and trained by the Serb military intelligence service. The leader of this intelligence service himself was involved in their support, and helped plan this operation, recruit and indoctrinate the Young \u201cBosnians\u201d, etc. So to say that this was the act of a single Serb, and the Serb government had nothing to do with it + no knowledge of it, is ridiculous. Also they pretended to play along with some of Austria-Hungary\u2019s demands in the aftermaths, but swiftly allowed those captured assassins/conspirators (in Serb jails) to escape, rather than handing them over for questioning. The Serb government and military intelligence service had previously funded Serb nationalists within Bosnia, Dalmatia etc. and supported attempts to start riots and uprisings. They were hellbent on war with Austria (there is a reason why most of Europe refered to them as the \u201cBalkan Apes\u201d and the Balkans as a powder keg, the two Balkan Wars and the primitive & brutal behaviour of the Serbs - I will get to that later -, were the chief reasons for that), to conquer what they thought was rightfully theirs (South-Slavic areas of A-H, which had Serb minorities, and the right to rule over the South Slavs). So hellbent even, that the Serb military launched a coup (with public support) against the royal couple, murdered them in brutal fashion, and threw their bodies off a balcony into the street for all to see. This happened, because this particular royal couple was (according to the Serb military and many in the population) on \u201ctoo friendly\u201d terms with Austria-Hungary, and because they prefered peaceful co-existance over conflict and lust for conquest/expansion. The new king was more eager to gain at least Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is just a nutshell of the things going on between A-H and the Kingdom of Serbia pre-WW1. There was more. The whole thing was a tragedy too, because Franz Ferdinand was a reformer. Once he inherited the throne, he was going to reshape the Austro-Hungarian Empire in a fundamental way. He was planning to give more autonomy to the other ethnicities, and give them rights equal to what the Austro-Germans and Hungarians had. He was also considering to shape the government more along the lines of the US (but still with monarchic traits), and maybe even re-name the whole thing as The United States of Greater Austria. A Danubian Federation like this would have been great for all involved (economically and living standard wise, common defence and safety, etc.), and more importantly would have created a more stable (Central and South-Eastern/Central-Eastern) Europe, and a potent counterweight to Germany (thus stopping the British Island Apes from constantly interferring in/starting wars on the continent to preserve their sacred \u201cbalance of power\u201d). Which is why i.e. Churchill and some other English politicians considered creating such a state, after the war. It\u2019s also a reason why Franz Ferdinand was not that popular at court, and particularly disliked by Franz-Josef.. ",
