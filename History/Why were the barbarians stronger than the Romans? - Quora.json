            "answer_text": "They weren\u00b4t. The barbarians were mainly divided between two groups: Celts and Germanics. Rome was occupied only two times from the time of its founding to the time of it\u2019s fall. The first time, to Gauls\u2026 Brennus, in 387 BC. Then the Romans created a hatred for Gauls and went on to conquering all of Gaul and most celtic lands by the end of the Republic. The second time, it fell for Visigoths (germanics), in 410 AD. As we consider that Rome conquered all of Gaul and most celtic lands, I guess they are not the barbarians you are talking about. So let\u2019s consider the germanic barbarians. Rome suffer a major defeat in the hands of the Cimbri and Teutones (germanics which in theory came from northern Germany and Jutland peninsula) around 100 BC. The battle of Arausio was a major blow for rome. Dozens of thousands of soldiers killed. Was that because barbarians were stronger than Romans? Hardly. Back then, Rome did not have a professional army. The army was mostly composed of allied Latins and Italians, all of who needed to own land and pay for their own equipment, Arausio was a major defeat (120 thousand dead Romans, biggest Roman defeat) mainly because the two generals who went to fight the germanics, did not get along. There were two consuls at the time, the war veteran and experienced commander Publius Rutilius Rufus, and Gnaeus Mallius Maximus. For reasons unknown, Publius Rutilius Rufus, the Senior Consul, stayed in Rome and sent the unbloodied Gnaus Mallius Maximus. However, Maximus was a Novus Homo, a New Man. Meaning he was not a patrician and the first man in family lineage to become a Consul. The other general in the war was Quintus Servilius Caepio, who was a pro-consul (lower rank than Consul), but a patrician (nobleman) Gnaeus, as a consul, should have been the commander. But Quintus Servillius Caepio was prideful and decided he would NOT obey a New Man, consul or not. (back in 100 BC, there was much more dispute between patricians and plebeians (even the ultra rich ones). Each man positioned their troops on different sides of a RIVER!!! And were surprised and massacred by the barbarian hordes. The result of Arausio was Gaius Marius (himself a New Man too), an experienced military commander, being elected Consul. It also opened big wounds on patrician pride. As the biggest defeat in Roman history had been caused by a hard headed prideful patrician who put birthright above military rank. Gaius Marius made huge reforms in the military, including in weapons, formations and specially, transforming it into a professional army by using the capite sensi (the head count, that is, the citizens that were poor enough that their only role in society was to be counted by head) Under Marius, Rome defeated the whole Cimbri and Teutones tribes\u2026 over 500 thousand people, while suffering MINOR losses. You see, for the Roman army tactics to be defeated by barbarians, you needed to make major blunders. Or be betrayed, which was what happened under Arminius, who supposedly was part of the Roman army, but betrayed them, split the army and ambushed them. Just so he could be king of the Germans. An idea other german chieftains did not like, no wonder they killed Arminius themselves a few years later, after offering Rome to poison him in exchange for treaties, which Rome denied as it wished to kill Arminius in battle. If the Germanics had been superior, Rome would have not re-captured all lost Eagles. Rome decided to halt its progress into Germany more because of logistics and few economic returns than for fear of \u201cstronger\u201d germanic warriors. Germanic chieftains paid tribute to Rome for centuries after Arminius. Finally, during the Pax Romana, Roman natural citizens were less and less warlike and Rome needed each time to recruit more and more soldiers from it\u2019s border areas. The german invaders\u2026 were not exactly invasions from outside. They were mostly whole tribes that were IN SERVICE of ROME, as mercenaries, soldiers, etc. As the Empire got weaker and weaker, some of those foreign troops started controlling the lands they were stationed on and effectively becoming THE central power. Some demanded payment for this or that, and in the absence of payment, as the economy was crumbling, those armies would come into Italy to plunder as payment\u2026 with barely any resistance, as THEY were Rome\u2019s armies at that time.

            "answer_text": "The exact answer depends on who you are calling barbarians. If you mean the Gauls, Iberians, and Britons (who I will call collectively the celts for this answer, even though technically that isn't an accurate name for the groups) who bloodied the Roman's nose several times before being conquered, then it's one answer. However that answer changes if you mean the Germanic tribes who carved up the Roman empire it is an entirely different answer. I'll attempt an answer for both. Celts: These peoples faced the Romans when the Roman armies were primarily medium shock infantry. Here's the thing about medium shock infantry though, it requires either flanking or overwhelming numbers to be effective at either killing or causing routes. Luckily for the Romans, they had numbers to spare. The problem it presented for the Romans though, is that these peoples tended to have better shock infantry which could halt the Roman charge, and also had good cavalry which the Romans could not counter. Because of these, the Romans often struggled against the celts as they lacked the tools to deal with them. Germanic tribes These faced the Romans after the Roman army shifted from medium shock infantry to heavy cavalry and heavy infantry. Due to a variety of reasons, the Romans ended up hiring these tribes as their new army. Due to that, there were not really many battles between the two, instead when the Germanic tribes decided to carve up the Western Roman Empire, the people just started paying tribute to the new guys and the Romans did not do anything.
