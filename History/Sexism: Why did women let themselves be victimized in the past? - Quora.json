            "answer_text": "Women weren't victimized in the past. Unfortunately people go wrong about history: They go backwards instead of going forward. When you want to understand history, you can't take your preconceived ideas into the past, but you'll have to start blank even further back in the history and then move forward from this point \u2013 i.e. the way history works. Human society was very strictly organized in the past, because this was required to survive. There was few time for leisure or anything besides daily fighting/working for survival. Only the top ~1% of society (kings/queens, nobility, etc.) was wealthy enough to do something else, while the other 99% often had to work hard from dawn till dusk to make their living. So past families/societies had to impose strict rules upon their members in order to survive/thrive. Rules for men and women were different, but it's wrong to portray these rules as somehow being made to victimize women. For example parents decided about marriages of their sons and daughters, even when these children were still young. The things sons and daughters learned were different, strictly tailored to their typical future way of life: Girls learned housekeeping, cooking, nurturing, \u2026 while boys learned working, defending/fighting, \u2026 . These arrangements were usually highly beneficial for everyone involved, optimized for the way people lived at the time. Oppressing or victimizing half of your family would have been a horribly stupid thing to do; remember that parents had to heavily rely on their children to take care of them once they are too old to do so on their own. Parents therefore had to make sure that their children are as successful as possible. So if there had been a superior way of doing things back then, then people would have done just that in order to gain an advantage in society. The industrial revolution and the technological advantages of the last two centuries changed economic necessities and reduced the amount of work needed to sustain a good (family) life. This allowed more and more people to enjoy freedoms, that were previously only available to the top 1%. Literacy, the ability to read, the right to choose your own religion, and the right to participate in political decisions became available to those living in developing/developed nations. With declining economic necessities to sustain your own (family) life, people also started to be free to choose lifestyles outside traditional social roles. Nowadays we are at the end of this liberating process. I hope this clears up why the claim that millions of men in past societies somehow \"victimized\" millions of women for basically no reason whatsoever, does not hold up to scrutiny. p.s.: The often uttered claim that greater physical strength allows people to oppress or victimize others is fallacious. If that were true, then physically strong people would have victimized physically weak people. Keep in mind that when people say \"men are stronger than women\", they are talking about averages; just like \"men are taller than women\" means only that men are taller on average. And just as there are small men and tall women, there are also physically strong women and physically weak men. Yet nobody says that weak men were victimized by strong women, right? p.p.s.: Unfortunately this belief of greater physical strength allowing victimization remains alive even today. This belief is for example often mentioned when talking about domestic violence, which leads people to ignore male victims and female perpretators of domestic violence \u2013 yet research shows that women and men make up equal amounts of victims and perpretators of domestic violence. Women also use \"weapons\" in domestic fights much more often than men to make up for lack of physical strength  (e.g. women like throwing plates or other items at hand). Women are also more prone to employ emotionally abusive techniques to control their spouses. These research results betray the notion of physical strength as important in relations as well. ",
