            "answer_text": "(History lesson ahead. If you want a quick answer, just skip to the end) Rome came into history somewhere between the 10th and 8th centuries BCE. The myth says that the first Romans were a pair of brothers named Remus and Romulus, demigod sons of Mars raised by a she-wolf, but in all likelihood Rome grew from a collection of trade/farming settlements along the River Tiber. Rome established itself as a Kingdom around the midpoint of the seventh century BCE. Give it fifty or so years and the Romans would stake their claim in their peninsula by surpassing the powerhouse faction of the region, the Etruscans. But around 509 BCE, Rome would go through its first major political conversion, changing to a Republic when the last of the seven kings, Tarquin the Proud, would be deposed. Rome spread her influence quickly (excepting a small embarassment in which the Eternal City would be sacked by Brennus and his Gauls, but don\u2019t worry about that), eventually completely subduing the other rival states in the Italian peninsula. The Fall of Tarentum in 281 BCE, despite the best efforts of Pyrrhus of Epirus, assured Roman hegemony in Italy for centuries. The Punic Wars would follow shortly after. Carthage, a city-state in Africa and perhaps Rome\u2019s most formidable opponent, would have large-scale conflicts with the Republic a total of three times. The first Punic War saw the Carthaginians pushed out of Sicily and the island falling under Roman control. The second Punic War involved a name you\u2019ve heard before- Hannibal. He gallivanted through Rome for about 15 years, kicking ass and generally causing mayhem (Especially at the Battle of Cannae, which needs no introduction). But indecision and lack of support from the Carthaginian government prevented him from marching on the city itself, and eventually the Roman general Scipio Africanus would decisively defeat him at the Battle of Zama. Scipio would then conquer modern-day Spain in the name of Rome. The third Punic War would end with the great city of Carthage being sacked and converted to a Roman province, the first of the Republic\u2019s conquests overseas. While Carthage was being wiped out, the Macedonian and Seleucid Successor Kingdoms were being crushed under Rome\u2019s iron boot. The fall of these great civilizations would see Rome emerge as the prominent power of the Mediterranean. This was around the first century BCE. Around that time Gaius Marius, a general and statesman, would revitalize Rome\u2019s legions by initiating a series of military reforms that would bring about the classic legionary, the greatest heavy infantry of the age. The rise of the most famous Roman who ever lived, Gaius Julius Caesar, would come after. His conquests in northern Gaul contributed to his meteoric rise in popularity. And once he eliminated the threat of his rival Pompey in the Battle of Pharsalus, he would stage a political takeover, and crown himself dictator. But it wouldn\u2019t be very lasting, and in 44 BCE he wouldn\u2019t be murdered by Brutus and Co. Never fear, though. His adopted son, Octavian, would prove himself every bit the man his father and more by overtaking his rivals for the head of state. He forced Marcus Aemilius Lepidus to retire into obscurity and crushed the two-way alliance of Mark Antony and the Pharaoh Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium, bringing Egypt under Rome\u2019s heel in the process. It was 27 BCE and Octavian was 36 years old. He had destroyed his enemies and staked his claim as the sole leader of Rome. He styled himself Augustus (which loosely translated to majestic) and Imperator. Which meant Emperor. Thus the second conversion. The Roman Empire was born. Augustus would bring about the Julio-Claudian dynasty, which would consist of five emperors. He would bring about massive conquest throughout Europe with his army of 28 standing legions. Roman culture and literature flourished. The peace that reigned during this time, known as Pax Romana, would last beyond Augustus\u2019 death in 28 CE. The Julio-Claudian dynasty would end with the tyrant Nero\u2019s suicide in 68 CE, and would be replaced with the Flavian dynasty. The Flavians were generally competent rulers, and would continue Rome\u2019s expansions while preserving the security of the state. The Nerva-Antoine dynasty would follow and would last from 96\u2013192 CE. This was Rome\u2019s economic and territorial peak. The Five Good Emperors were of this dynasty, and their reigns would be the Golden Age of Rome. Hadrian\u2019s Wall, the Pantheon, and the philosophical work Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (my favorite Emperor!) are results of this time. This is where things get hectic. The decline of Rome began after the death of Commodus, last of the Nerva-Antoine dynasty. Immediately following, a tumultuous year saw FIVE SEPARATE EMPERORS before Septimius Severus took power and established the Severan dynasty. During this time, infighting and backstabbing would run rampant for years, all the way up until 235 CE, when Alexander Severus was killed by his own Praetorian Guard. The Crisis of the Third Century would follow immediately after. Civil wars, political instability, foreign invasion, disease, and financial destitution would plague the Roman state. New religions, namely Christianity, were beginning to spread, further contributing to the chaos. In a 49-year period, 26 EMPERORS would ascend to the head of state, a testament to the absolute fucking ridiculousness of this period. In 284 CE, a bold and decisive general named Diocletian would take control and form the Tetrarchy, the third political shift of Rome. This is seen as the effective death of Classic Rome. He divided the Empire into four major regions, each governed by a ruler called a Tetrarch. This coupled with Diocletian\u2019s tax reforms and his conquests of certain factions in the East stabilized Rome for awhile. And he was so damn proud of what he did that he abdicated along with his co-emperor, leaving only two Tetrarchs. This had rather predictable results, meaning that it collapsed quicker than a fucking sand castle. Constantine the Great, the first Christian Emperor, would ascend to the Tetrarchy (or rather what was left of it) around 306 CE and kept the east half of Rome from falling into ruin. The once-vast Empire was essentially split in half at this rate, the West and East Roman Empires. The West Roman Empire would quickly fall from barbarian invasions, but the East would survive as the Byzantine Empire nearly a thousand years after the death of its western counterpart. To sum up, Rome lasted a long, long time. It started between 10\u20138000 BCE and lasted until 284 CE, when Emperor Diocletian was forced to split the Empire after the Crisis of the Third Century.  The \u2018Empire\u2019, circa 400 CE. ",
