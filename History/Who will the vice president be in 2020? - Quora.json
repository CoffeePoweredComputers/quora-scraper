            "answer_text": "What will be the vice president in 2020? I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re asking about the Vice President of the US. (Remember this is an international site.) If neither Trump nor Pence leaves office early, due to death, resignation, or removal from office, then Pence will continue to be Vice President throughout 2020. (The next election is in November 2020. The current term of office ends January 20, 2021.) If Trump leaves office early, Pence will become President, leaving the Vice Presidency temporarily vacant. If Pence leaves office early, the Vice Presidency will be temporarily vacant. If both leave office early, without enough intervening time for the (possibly new) President to nominate a new Vice President, Speaker Nancy Pelosi will become President, and the Vice Presidency will be temporarily vacant. Other scenarios are possible, such as Trump leaving office, Pence becoming President and nominating a new Vice President, and then Pence leaving office. It would be a mildly interesting exercise to enumerate all the possible scenarios. Under any of these scenarios, the President will nominate a new Vice President (under Section 2 of the 25th Amendment) who will take office after approval by Congress. We have no way of knowing who that will be. Either Trump or Pence would almost certainly nominate a Republican; Pelosi would most likely nominate a Democrat. If you\u2019re asking who will be elected as Vice President in 2020 (taking office in 2021), we have no way of knowing that either. The general election is nearly 2 years away. Looking at history, it\u2019s never been possible to predict the outcome of a general election this far in advance (except perhaps when there\u2019s a very popular sitting first-term President who is likely to win a second term).

The Dems have picked a peach: isn't Trump, vowed to make gender bias a requirement in choosing a running mate. Not a scintilla of an idea as to what comes after the swearing in ceremony. Fingers crossed the Woman a heartbeat away from filling the roll of president has some thoughts on filling it and not merely removing a president. I'm beginning to think the DNC's mascot is an insult to Donkey intelligence. ",
