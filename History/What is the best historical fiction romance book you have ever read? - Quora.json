            "answer_text": "\"The Blue Castle\" by L. M. Montgomery is actually my favorite book of all time. It's about a young woman who wakes up on the morning of her 29th birthday and realizes that she has wasted her life\u2014she has never left her childhood home, her life is ruled by her ridiculous family clan, and she has never even been in love. Then when she's diagnosed with a fatal illness and given less than a year to live, she decides to take her life into her own hands  and ends up proposing (to her high-standing family's horror) to the town scoundrel, a man rumored to have already killed seven previous wives. If that doesn't interest you, then I suggest \"Edenbrooke\" by Julianne Donaldson (a Regency romance). The first time I picked up this book, I read it seventeen times again in the same month\u2014it was so good! As all romances go, it had its cheesy parts, but besides that it was very well written. The main character is extremely relatable (read: plain younger sister vs. beautiful older sister) and reading the book is like watching the ultimate chic flick. Not only is the romantic interest to die for, he's also hilarious. Everyone I've talked to has said they had their doubts at the beginning of the book but have ended up loving it. It's the kind of book that crushes your hopes and dreams because it's that good.  ",

Product description From the recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Literature, a \u201cbrilliant...enchanting novel\u201d (New York Times Book Review) of romance, deceit, religion, and magic set in eighteenth-century Portugal at the height of the Inquisition. Portugal, 1711: an amorous friar is pursued naked through the rubble-strewn streets of Lisbon; an enthusiastic procession of flagellants roars with pleasure over the damnation of adultery; a royal prince uses hapless sailors for target practice; and women dressed in colorful finery watch as lapsed converts and sorcerers are put to death by flames. In the midst of the terrors of the Inquisition and the plague, a seemingly mismatched couple discover the wonders of love. This poetic tale, graced with exquisite historical details and full of magic and adventure, is a tapestry of human folly and human will.
