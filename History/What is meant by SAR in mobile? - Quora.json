            "answer_text": " SAR (specific absorption rate) is an indication of the amount of radiation that is absorbed into a head whilst using a cellular phone, the higher the SAR rating the more radiation that is absorbed into the head. SPECIFIC ABSORPTION RATE (SAR)A SAR value is a measure of the maximum energy absorbed by a unit of mass of exposed tissue of a person using a mobile phone, over a given time or more simply the power absorbed per unit mass. SAR values are usually expressed in units of watts per kilogram (W/kg) in either 1g or 10g of tissue. SAR might be an alien term for few people but then you have no idea that basically it accompanies you as your shadow does. Our body absorbs a certain energy when we are exposed to the electromagnetic field. SAR is specific absorption rate which is the measure of the amount of energy that tissue of human body absorbs in certain time when exposed to a radio frequency electromagnetic field. How to check SAR value in your phone?Any smartphone at or below this SAR levels is \u201csafe\u201d to use. You can check Radiation level in terms of SAR of your smartphone by dialing a USSD code*#07#, if results shows SAR below 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg) then it is OK otherwise you are advised to change your smartphone immediately. What high SAR value in Mobile Phones does ?It damages our tissues.It makes us prone to brain damages as the maximum absorption region is the head.High SAR value has an adverse effect on our mental health.It increases the stress level.Reduces production of melatonin.Fatigue and headache.Causes infertility in men.The maximum rate of SAR value in Mobile Phones is 1.6 watts per kilogram. If a mobile phone has an SAR value more than this limit is not certified to be sold in the market. FCC has made attempts to track the RF levels and then finalised the limit. The mobile phones, when kept near to head, is reported to cause the maximum absorption of RF radiations. FCC has ordered for the sale of least possible SAR level. But on the part of awareness people are negligent towards the monstrous fact. In today\u2019s generation, it is natural that being away from cellphones can be strenuous but then we should be all set to face the consequences. RemediesThe minimum possible usage of mobile phones.For long conversations earphones are preferable.Not to sleep with cellphones near to the head.Do not keep cell phones in your pockets for a long period of time.",
