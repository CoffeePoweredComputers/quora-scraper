            "answer_text": "At Lepanto, the generally medieval fleet of the Ottomans ran into the Renaissance fleet of Catholic Europe. In terms of numbers, the Ottomans had more ships (212 vs 278) and more sailors and embarked soldiers (68,500 vs 81,500) and intended to wage a classic battle of ships tied up alongside with the crews and embarked soldiers settling the issue at close quarters. The Christian fleet was still largely oar driven but was in the process of converting to a naval force built around the heavy naval gun with over 1800 heavy guns amongst the ships compared to 750 for the Turks. A Turkish oar galley mounting a ramming attack against a Christian galleasse would be pairing it\u2019s one or two, or possibly none at all, \u201cbow chasers\u201d against the multiple gun broadside of the galleass! Any galley attempting to come alongside and board would be completely defenseless! The Turks\u2019 one real opportunity that I see is to avoid any contact in close proximity to land where the shore prevented an envelomment from at least one side. In the open ocean, they could have executed a double envelopment (ie \u201cCannae style\u201d), bypassing the lumbering but deadly Christian Galleasses and attacking the much lighter and less numerous Christian galleys on equal terms with advantages in numbers. As it was, the undamaged Christian galleys faced the pounded Turkish fleet after running the gauntlet of fire. The end result, (17 Christian galleys sunk vs over 200 Turkish galleys sunk) was obvious. My option, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, may not have changed much, particularly if the galleasses had been able to retreat and joint the melee, but it definitely would have given the Turks a better chance, imho.

            "answer_text": "First was to attack the Catholic fleet while it was still assembling. Galley on galley, the Turks had more men with more experienced crews. With enough ships concentrated against the superior Venetian Galleasses the larger ships would eventually fall. The second would be to discover said Galeasses, and then emulate them. The Turkish shipyards worked overtime to rebuilt the fleet after the battle, and that new fleet included several galleasses. The flagships (both galleys) did duel during the battle-the Ottoman Sultana almost captured the Holy League Real before the Papal ship Capitana attacked from the flank. That led to the capture of the Sultana and the death of Admiral Ali Pasha in battle. Finally it could have been fought in the open ocean or in Turkish-held waters. The Open ocean would be difficult for the Turkish galley, but the Catholic galleys would also be impeded, while allowing for Ali Pasha\u2019s larger fleet to use its numbers properly and prevent the Holy League from using reserves late in the battle. If the Ottomans had lured the League navy into the range of land batteries, those batteries would have provided much-needed firepower, possibly destroying the galleasses that formed the bulwark of the Catholic line.

In addition to that, lack of knowledge of geography doesn't help the Ottomans either. The point is, The Ottomans always were a grand and powerful land force and the small improvements during the reign of the Suleiman the Magnificent doesn't help to change that.
