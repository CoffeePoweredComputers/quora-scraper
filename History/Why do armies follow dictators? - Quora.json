            "answer_text": "It depends, but for the most part, it\u2019s because of power politics and privilege. Essentially, dictators have no actual political legitimacy \u2014 not since the Roman Republic fell, at least (because Roman dictators were traditionally elected, as opposed to modern dictators) \u2014 which means that there is no institutional framework justifying their stay in power. As a result, they are forced to look for, let\u2019s call them, \u201calternative\u201d means of staying in power. These alternative means are the armed forces, typically. It\u2019s not hard to see why, either: the military is essentially the one institution in a state with the most hard power available. A dictator that relied on the judiciary or legislative arms would get overthrown easily simply because they would lack actual coercive mechanisms to force the population and government to do what they want. This gives the military leverage \u2014 if the dictator takes care of them, then they take care of the dictator. Quid pro quo. Thus, in dictatorships, some of the best-maintained officials in the administration tend to be military figures. Generals, colonels \u2014 essentially the higher-ups in the military food chain, though the lower ranks are also provided for far better than the average citizen. As a result, the dictator now has the means to essentially force through whatever changes they want with impunity because \u2014 let\u2019s be honest here \u2014 who\u2019s going to punish them when they have the backing of the military? The police? The judiciary? \u201cWhat\u2019s right\u201d? \u201cPopular opinion\u201d? So that\u2019s why the armies tend to follow dictators \u2014 because the dictators make sure to keep them happy. The moment they fail to do so is typically the moment the army turns on them. Exceptions do occur, however. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no single answer, but, judging from what I know about our military coups in Latin America, I believe there are four main reasons: Military dictators are perceived by the military as \u201cone of them\u201d and catering for their needs, even a long-time dictator, like Stroessner. In this sense, the Armed Forces effectively loot the country for their own good, amassing wealth, acquiring property and getting privilege and immunity.Dictators imposed by a stronger foreign power (usually the USA) are accepted, even begrudgingly, because the military knows that the alternative is a war they\u2019d lose.In Latin America, as a rule of thumb, armed forces are more for social control than for national defense: their usual enemy is the people, not foreign invaders. Some Latin American countries haven\u2019t fought many wars, but have been very active politically. Argentina had not fought any wars since the third quarter of the 19th century when it invaded the Falklands. Uruguayan military had not fought any wars since they consolidated their independence. Examples like this are common.Sense of hierarchy. In Latin America coups are always staged by the top tiers of the military, either on their own or backing a civil politician. We haven\u2019t seen cases of coups breaching hierarchy, like other countries, in which coups were performed by captains (Burkina Faso), lieutenants (Ghana), colonels (Greece) or sergeants (Haiti and Cuba \u2014 these are the two exceptions that confirm the general rule).",
