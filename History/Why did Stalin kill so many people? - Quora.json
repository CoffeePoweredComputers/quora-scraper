            "answer_text": "Because it\u2019s hard being the top dog of probably one of the most hated and chaotic country in the world at the time. Stalin had a dream. A dream deeply about an industrialised, united and global Union with every single inch of land on Earth under Communist\u2019s control - and extensively, his control.  But before he could make his dream a reality, there\u2019s one giant foe that he must destroy: Capitalism. And the only way to do that is through a Great War, another version of the War-To-End-All-Wars by completely eradicating capitalism from the face of the globe. It is common sense that if you want to wage a war later, you must prepare yourself for the war now. He needs weapons, tanks, aeroplanes,\u2026, the tools and machines needed to manufacture them and of course, the materials to build and sustain them.  But Russia - then USSR - is an agricultural state. The nation\u2019s economy lived solely on the export of grains and such products to the West, and he must take a large portion of those grains which are also used to feed the populace, for export to get the money he needed. But the price of grains dropped like a five tonne boulder when the Great Depression kicks in. Stalin had to export more and more until so little grains were kept domestically that a massive famine explodes within the nation. And from 1931 to 1933, 7\u201310 million people drop from hunger in Ukraine alone. This event in Ukraine is called: Holodomor (Death By Hunger). The number could even be more than that all over Russia, maybe even as much as 15 million.  (This is a normal occurrence in those years.)  Stalin is also an extremely paranoid man, this is something that whenever someone mentioned him, it would always come to mind. He\u2019s afraid of anyone or anything with more power than him. The Kulaks were one of those things. Kulaks were the rich land owners that control a huge portion of the country\u2019s economy through their influence on production. So what? Yep.  He searched for them - and he killed them all. Five million of them. He eradicated a whole social class just because they have a larger impact on the country than him. This plunged the country more into the spiral of hunger and death as production cut back sharply. But in Stalin\u2019s head, it\u2019s a worthy sacrifice for a better Soviet Union. He even killed many more thousands - if not, millions of educated people so that they cannot form oppositions against him. All in all, if something has a 0.1% chance of going against him, he would go to great length that it is erased from the history of the Earth.  After the Second World War, Stalin became increasingly more paranoid, resulting in him questioning every single staff member that was close to him. He thought that they were secretly working against him and will kill him in a coup the next minute. So yea.  He smoked them all. The scrawl on this paper is by the guy himself: Shoot all names on this list. -J. St. Forty-six generals were immediately dragged out of their beds and shot. The saying that if you want a prosperous life by being close to the King doesn\u2019t apply here. The closer you are with him, the closer to death you are. So everyone was absolutely terrified of him. He even made his own son bite the dust.   It was of this same paranoia that Stalin later died a lonely death by a stroke. Everyone close to him was so afraid that they didn\u2019t dare to check on him when he didn\u2019t leave his room. Only almost a day later that they discovered him in very bad shape, drenched in his own urine and couldn\u2019t even speak properly. A fitting death.  General Consensus: Even in death - still grumpy.

            "answer_text": "As a true Communist leader, Stalin realized that this was the most rational thing to do. Real practitioners of Communism face many problems that are inherent to the concept of class struggle. Proletarian dictatorship always triggers a massive resistance from Capitalists and their allies among educated classes and small property owners. Which makes sure that sooner or later, a Communist ruler always faces the \u201cdictator\u2019s dilemma\u201d. Everyone who has not emigrated, or got imprisoned, or killed, professes you loyalty\u2014but you as a proletarian revolutionary know that among them there are a lot hidden enemies. Professor Mark Harrison from the University of Warwick illustrated it by two graphs. The first one shows the normal distribution of \u201callies\u201d versus enemies before the proletarian dictatorship takes hold, the other one after the full triumph of Communists (in the USSR, 1933 and onwards).  After a Communist revolution, the distribution increasingly shifts to the right:  Professor Mark Harrison explains: After two decades of increasingly repressive dictatorship, all citizens looked alike and could be told apart only by such imperfect markers as class origins and past political and social affiliations. Given that, Stalin\u2019s solution was to impose excess repression. He decided to kill all those in the left tail of the professed loyalty distribution, despite the fact that all claimed to be loyal \u2013 and despite the fact that many of them truly were loyal. He killed many more than his estimate of the true number of enemies in the hope that, at the cost of killing many of the truly loyal, he would also catch a high proportion of those that were only simulating loyalty.
