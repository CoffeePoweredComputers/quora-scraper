            "answer_text": "Yes You can! If you think about it .. Exchanges are like super markets and Stocks are like commodities. You can buy a commodity from one market and sell the same in other market. I currently use Zerodha broker to trade and if you see I added WABAG script in my Market watch from both BSE and NSE exchanges. Also you can see there is 0.20 INR difference in prices between both exchanges. If I remember correctly I bought 100 shares of WABAG from NSE exchange.  When you buy shares it takes T+2 days for the Shares to get deposited in your Demat account. Once they are in your Demat account you cannot really know from which exchange you bought the share. It is just like any other commodity.  Now you can sell the stock in any exchange you want considering which exchange gives you better price. If you check my market watch currently, holding of 100 Shares are denoted on both NSE and BSE script of WABAG as shown below, but I do not have 100 shares in both NSE and BSE. So, this tells us that these 100 shares can be sold in either of the exchanges.  You can go to the script in one exchange and click sell button. At the end of the day clearing houses will automatically debit the shares from your Demat account(doesn\u2019t matter where you buy) and credits them in buyers Demat account.  As mentioned in other answers, arbitrageurs take advantage of price discrepancies of an Asset / Stock between different exchanges. They buy in one exchange where Asset is cheaper and sell in other exchange where Asset is costlier. But these discrepancies or price arbitrage opportunities will be there for few milli seconds. Because these days Algos keep scouting for these opportunities and immediately capture the arbitrages which actually makes markets efficient. Hope this helps !!! ",
