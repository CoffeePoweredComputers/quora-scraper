            "answer_text": "hah. The Byzantine Empire had a clever way to deal with dissenters.  The Greek Orthodox payed 10 % taxes, schismatics 20 %, \u201cheretics\u201dand Jews 30 % and pagans 40 %. I am not sure about the actual figures but you get the message. It became very expensive to stay pagan! Actually the muslims followed a like system. Really persecuted were only Manicheans and like gnostic sects. They were seen as worshipping the Bent One, which was only half true. And in many cases they were just deported .. Sure, there existed Edicts against Pagans but rarely active persecution. A churchman residing at Gaza in Palestine remarked that the Governor still tolerated Pagan Festivals . It was at the Eve of the Arrival of Islam..  Fourth Oecumenical Council of Chalcedon 451 AD You have to realize that in the East was never one Church since the Copts and Jacobites refused to accept the Council of Chalchedon. So the Church was less powerful as in fully Catholic Western Europe. And in the East the Emperor -or Empress- decided, not the Church. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes indeed. Greek pagans were cruely perscuted, mostly during the ages of Justinianus and theodosios. Codex Theodosianus and it\u2019s ecclesiastical edictus (https://ia802705.us.archive.org/20/items/ecclesiasticaled00boyd/ecclesiasticaled00boyd.pdf) were strict for someone who insisted to be pagan. Emperor Arcadius followed the same policy, and all succesors also. After some decades it was inevitable for Pagans to dig deeply in the ground and burry all their religion beliefs in order to survive, acompanied whith their statues which remained undemolished. Emperors plan was\u201dOne empire, one religion\u201d. We can asume why\u2026 Centuries later, oficial church was so unfamiliar to anccient Greek politistic inheritage, that they gave to the Slavic nations a new alphabet instead from the Greek, the new testament was written, in order to teach them the ordodox religion. They also changed the figure of the same letters in both alpabets. Greek and Cyrilic. It needs dosens of pages to show what Greek pagans suffered from Byzantin emperors and episcops. You can see some of the persecutions here: Persecution of pagans under Theodosius I - Wikipedia. ",
