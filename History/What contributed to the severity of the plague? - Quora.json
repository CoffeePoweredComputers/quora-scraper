            "answer_text": "Short answer: new shipping routes. International trade expanded during the Middle Ages, and by the 1300s it was extensive. Rats, which were everywhere, got on the ships with their fleas and went to places where folks had no prior exposure to that strain of plague. The rats left the ship, died of plague, and the fleas bit other animals, including humans, instead. The plague spread that way unless the weather was cold when it became a person-to-person airborne infection. ",
