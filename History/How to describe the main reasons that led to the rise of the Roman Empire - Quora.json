            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve got a very competitive oligarchy, but unlike in Athens, that competition does not take the form of directly attacking one another (mostly), but in competing to out-impress one another. Who can build the best sewer or aqueduct or road or conquer the toughest enemy?Meanwhile the lower classes are not pushovers. They fight for their rights. This means that they get included in what\u2019s going on, are willing to build the roads and sewers and aqueducts and fight the wars.As a consequence of the above they formed a good mixed constitution government.They arose in a relative power vacuum. Aside from Carthage there weren\u2019t other big powers in the area. The Etruscans, Celts and Greeks were divided. There were competitors, but not like the way things were in the Eastern Mediterranean/Middle East.Finally, there\u2019s an undefinable quality of determination and persistence that cannot be explained.",

            "answer_text": "There are different reasons, and in different stages, maybe linked one to another. In early stage, from VIII to III century BC, meaning King\u2019s age and first Republic, only the hardness and the convention of being part of a greater plan helped Romans. They were a city state like many others in the area. So why Rome and not Vejus or Tarquinia? Romans were probably a bit more mixed in culture, unifying Greeks of Campania, Etruscan and Italics influences. They had a complex mythology making them think they were chosen by gods for a big mission, and they fought accordingly.Then better organization and geographical reasons helped Rome: Rome was a huge city with high population, allowing a great army and great resources. Meanwhile Alps gave protection from invasion and position in the center of mediterranean sea was important.Then all successful was due to superior state organization in Military and supplying, beside good diplomatic capabilities.",
