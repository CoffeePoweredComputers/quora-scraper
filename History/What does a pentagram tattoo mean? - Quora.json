            "answer_text": "The pentagram tattoo people will tell you when you read is for protection and black magic destruction good luck love and health but that\u2019s when it comes to the witchcraft. With christianity it is a sin and in christianity it is the FACE of witchcraft in judgment it represents the 5 trees in paradise that is the Father and the Son. In Job 8:14 it calls it a spider\u2019s web the hope of evil doers - what this means it is nothing spiritually atleast not when it comes to the powers of God - the \u201cstar of David\u201d which isn\u2019t the six pointed star it is the five pointed star since that\u2019s the star David is wearing when he\u2019s in the earth not the six pointed star. It symbolizes an allegiance to devil worship that\u2019s what it means so it\u2019s a sin put short. The Messiah has it on his back according to Isaiah 38:17 along with his eyes he has the tattoo on his back it is prophesied by king hezekiah when he was in the spirit after receiving extended life that the Messiah who is God would carry his sins on his back. The pentagram like many symbols probably came from the fallen angels to deceive man which was their purpose of giving the witchcraft to make it look like something it wasn\u2019t other symbols are man made ",
