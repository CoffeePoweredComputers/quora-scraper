            "answer_text": "Thanks for your question. If you want your history in an easily digestible form, written in a novelistic and clear way- one author to investigate is Sterling Seagrave. He has written books about Japan, China, The Philippines. Any one of these books will alter your perspective, bring new insights, open new horizons and give you a new perspective. This is the history where the curtain is ripped open and places explored where very few other historians dare to go. Try The Soong Dynasty for example, if you want to know about China\u2019s 20th Century. If you ever wondered about the ties between Taiwan\u2019s rulers and gangsters- this is a great beginning.

Image: Gold Warriors: America's Secret Recovery of Yamashita's Gold: Sterling Seagrave, Peggy Seagrave A review of the book is here: LRB \u00b7 Chalmers Johnson \u00b7 The Looting of Asia: Japan, the US and stolen gold ",
