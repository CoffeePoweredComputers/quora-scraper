            "answer_text": "The political history of China can be divided into three periods based on sovereignty. Prehistoric China is excluded since the polity is too primitive for political history. Feudal China: Xia to Zhou dynastyImperial China: Qin to Qing dynastyRepublican China: Republic of China(1912) and afterDuring Feudal China, political power was distributed among various feudal lords. The various lords are the sovereign entity. The culture is naturally diversified. During Imperial China, political power was centralized. The emperor or the imperial family is the sovereign. A complex bureaucracy is created to administer such a large land area. Cultural diversity is reduced for ease of administration. A cultural identity of China was developed. There are various periods of fragmentation to reform the administrative system and revitalize social stagnation during this period. Republican China has been a continuation of Imperial China in many ways, but the people becomes the sovereign. The political institutions are still evolving to deal with modernity and cultural diversity. ",
