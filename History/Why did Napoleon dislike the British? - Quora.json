            "answer_text": "The personal opinion of Napoleon of the British is very curious and demands a good deal of research and thought to understand. Such is my interpretation of this. I feel that Napoleon had a very strong dislike of the British, but not to the point of being completely overcome by hatred or illusions. Napoleon certainly disliked the British for being his most consistent and vehement enemy. When a British army landed in the Iberian Peninsula in 1808, Napoleon was reportedly overjoyed at the thought of finally fighting the British on terra firma. However, there were more pressing developments in Europe, and Napoleon was obliged to leave Spain in order to fight the Austrians and their new armies before fighting the British. If anything, Napoleon had many grudging admirations of British figures. He openly praised Admiral Nelson, even after the disaster at Trafalgar. Napoleon had a deep respect and appreciation for the Duke of Marlborough\u2019s campaigns during the War of Spanish Succession (1701\u20131715), naming him as one of seven most important figures to study in military history. The Duke of Wellington is an interesting case. Over of the course of the Peninsular War, Napoleon expressed some admiration for the way Wellington conducted himself, and his efficiency in war, saying that Wellington did many of the things that he would do himself. Other times, Napoleon named Wellington nothing but a \u2018sepoy general\u2019. Before Waterloo, many French generals who had fought Wellington before tried to explain to Napoleon his skill at war, and Napoleon snapped at them, saying that just because he beat you doesn\u2019t mean he is an actually good general (I do not have the exact quote). Napoleon had a deep hatred for Admiral Sydney Smith, and the feeling was well reciprocated. During the Egyptian campaign, Smith delivered to Napoleon newspapers of France\u2019s recent defeats in Europe. Smith played an important role in Napoleon\u2019s defeat at the Siege of Acre in 1799. I would like to end with a certain quote, taken from Gaspard Gourgaud\u2019s M\u00e9morial de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, \u201cI place great value on habits of order and subordination. Look at the English! They conquered us, and yet they are very far from being our equals\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Mohamed provided good answers. Great Britain from begin of French Revolutionary War until 1815, brief peace from March 1802 - May 1803 Was almost never ended war. Napoleon was annoyed with British for few reasons. 1 - Virtually every countries in Europe was traded with Great Britain, even countries were under his controlled. I will get back to it later. 2 - Blockade of France by Royal Navy 3 - Every coalitions were raised by Great Britain and few countries, and backed up by financial from GB themselves. Napoleon had no choice to fight again and again. Known as Golden Cavalry of St George. Funded Austria \u00a31.5m in 1793, and adjusted for inflation which was \u00a3273,000,000 in 2011. 4 - Linked to third point, Great Britain was so wealthy and robust financial system. GB can take very large debt, and ability to pay it off hundred years later. In 1815, debt of GB was \u00a31 billion and pay it off after World War I. France financial system was very poor by compared that they would imposed heavy tax on countries they conquered. For example, they took Portugal and imposed 100 million francs on population. 5 - It is linked to first point and ultimately, his downfall. As I said, Napoleon was annoyed with Europe traded with GB free at will and decided introduce Continental System. In effective, he banned European to trade with GB. Lots of countries ignored him, for example\u2026 Sweden had stage fake war with Great Britain and still trade with them! Portugal was and is, oldest ally of GB and refused to bend down to his demand. He was then invaded Portugal, set off Peninsular War which was drained his resource. Russia was too ignored him and still trade with GB and I am sure, you already know what happened after this\u2026 Napoleon invaded Russia! He was more annoyed with Great Britain, he can't touch them so tried hurt them with economic that had backfire on him. Continental System - Wikipedia ",
