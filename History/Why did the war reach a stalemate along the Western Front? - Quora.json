            "answer_text": "In essence, the technology and methods of defence outpaced the technology and methods of attack. Very simply: When you attack, you couldn\u2019t bring most of your heavy equipment with you. And you were attacking INTO the enemies heavy equipment. You charged their machine-guns, when they were in their defensive positions, and you didn\u2019t have the technology or training to really do so efficiently. When you attack, and even win, you have advanced out of the range of your own artillery, and closer to the enemies guns. Advantage, defender. You\u2019re also low on supplies, and the roads and communication lines haven\u2019t been established, while the enemy is fighting in their own front yard, and has all of those things avaliable. Secondly, organisation. People were still learning how to Modern War. Supplies, technology, organising attacks. And all of it with written messages, telegraphs, pigeons. Artillery were just starting to learn how to fire indirectly properly. Previously adequate rigid command styles were finding themselves failing in the face of a battlefield that had never moved faster. Counterattack was easy, attack not so much. Enemy reinforcement could arrive quickly via train, but your own train lines were many miles away. The average rifle company had no grenade launchers to clear enemy machine-gun nests, or even regular grenades, they had no smoke, they used bolt action rifles rather than assault rifles and machine guns. They didn\u2019t use mortars or rocket launchers or heavy machine-guns they could easily carry, or have radios to coordinate and communicate. They had no body armour, or even proper helmets. They had no armoured personnel carriers or tanks, so they had to walk everywhere, and their supplies were carrier by horse and by person, rather than by truck. In modern war, the rifle company has as much gear and equipment and firepower as half an army in the first world war. You wouldn\u2019t have a dozen machine-guns in the regiment, let alone the dozens of lightweight machine-guns the average rifle company carries. They didn\u2019t have high nutrition, field cookable MREs, and their medical technology was very primitive. In short, they were horribly equipped by modern standards. And in those circumstances, it\u2019s pretty easy to defend. A hole in the ground, and a machine-gun, across an open field, is very hard to attack properly if you\u2019re not equipped for it, trained for it, and have the proper support of an army. And they weren\u2019t, and didn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Mainly because the Germans overestimated the French military. Due to the events in Eastern Europe, France and Great Britain were on their toes and the French military was prepared for a possible German assault. The Germans initiated the Schlieffen Plan, which was a strategic plan to quickly move through Belgium and get around the French military to take Paris. However, many German officers and generals expected the French to crumble under the might of the most advanced military in Europe like Belgium had. Sadly for the German forces, the French were already mobilized in the right places and managed to halt the advance before the Germans could reach Paris. In the first weeks of the war the Western Front was rather mobile, actual troop movement and urban combat occurred. By September 15th, 1914; the First Battle of the Marne began, this is when the first trenches were dug. This happened all across the Western Front, as battles drew to stalemates both sides dug trenches and thus, the Western Front came to be as we know it today. Once Great Britain and her colonies joined the war, and Germany focused most of its power on the Western Front, trench warfare was the norm. This was fully cemented until the United States joined the conflict, with the Americans bolstering the Allied numbers, they finally managed to break through the German lines. ",
