That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the \u201cmiracle of life.\u201d I would absolutely NOT advise any \u201cnatural\u201d abortion methods, as I can only imagine that\u2019s the underlying question here. So, can papaya leaves cause a miscarriage? Maybe. You\u2019d be better advised by a medical professional if you or someone you know is pregnant and does not wish to be. Please don\u2019t play games with your body and life and potentially that of an unborn child. Any number of horrific things can come from a botched abortion. ",

If you wish to terminate your pregnancy, contact your own gynecologist or contact a Planned Parenthood clinic and make an appointment to go in. You can still get a safe, legal medical abortion up to about your 23rd week of pregnancy in the US, depending on what state you live in. If you are less than 10 weeks pregnant, there is a prescription abortion pill that will induce an abortion, and if you are 10 weeks or more pregnant, you can have a D&C (a minor medical procedure) to terminate your pregnancy. If you are 23 weeks or more pregnant, then you will probably not be able to obtain a legal abortion unless you have the means to travel to Canada. Check out the Planned Parenthood website for more information about obtaining birth control to prevent pregnancy, and about abortion options. ",

You can also misoprostol on its own, although after 12 weeks, there is a higher chance of a complication and the medicines are used differently.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is safe to eat papaya during pregnancy, as long as it is ripe. A well ripened papaya is rich in vitamins C and E. It is also a good source of fibre and folic acid. Papaya helps to prevent and control constipation and heartburn. For these reasons, many experts recommend that pregnant women eat moderate amounts of ripe papaya. Some women make a tonic by blending portions of ripe papaya with milk and honey. This mixture is considered a rich source of nutrients for pregnant and nursing mums. However if the papaya is unripe, then no, it isn't safe. An unripe or semi-ripe papaya is rich in a substance called latex. Research shows that this concentrated form of latex may trigger uterine contractions. Also, papaya skin and seeds shouldn't be eaten. As a safety measure, many pregnant mums exclude papaya from their diets altogether. Despite the research, it is a traditional belief that eating papaya can cause miscarriage and stillbirth. https://www.babycenter.in/x1023025/is-it-safe-to-eat-papaya-ipapitai-during-pregnancy#ixzz53iQ7zw00 ",
