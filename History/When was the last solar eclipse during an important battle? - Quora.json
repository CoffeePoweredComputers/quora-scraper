By coincidence, an annular solar eclipse occurred around 2:30 p.m. at the tail end of the battle. The event would have been seen as a deep partial eclipse from the battlefield, and the reduction in sunlight would have been noticable. The name of the battle became known as \u201cIsandlwana\u201d which in Zulu means \u201cthe day of the dead moon.\u201d ",
