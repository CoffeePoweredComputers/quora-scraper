            "answer_text": "It is very difficult to judge a historic person by current societal norms. There's no way around it: Gandhi was a racist early in his life, according to Gandhi biographer Ramachandra Guha.  In 1903, when Gandhi was in South Africa, he wrote that white people there should be \"the predominating race.\" He also said black people \"are troublesome, very dirty, and live like animals.\" Gandhi as a young man went with the ideas of his culture and his time. He thought in his 20s that Europeans are the most civilized. Indians were almost as civilized, and Africans were uncivilized.  However, he outgrew his racism quite decisively, and for most of his life as a public figure, he was an anti-racist, talking for an end to discrimination of all kinds. That included gender discrimination. Gandhi championed women in politics; something unheard of then. The first prime minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru probably summed it up the best. In 1962, when British filmmaker Richard Attenborough began researching what would become his 1982 Gandhi film, he asked Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, how he should portray his late colleague. Nehru famously replied that Gandhi was \"a great man, but he had his weaknesses, his moods and his failings.\" He begged Attenborough not to turn Gandhi into a saint. He was \"much too human,\" Nehru said. Source: Gandhi Is Deeply Revered, But His Attitudes On Race And Sex Are Under Scrutiny ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely NO. He has worked in South Africa when he was very young. There may be instances during early 1900\u2019s when he may have compared blacks with savages due to his personal experiences in dealing with them. But over the time humans evolve and they make the impact on humanity. Gandhiji made one of the greatest impact by his practices of non violence and had influenced Martin Luther King jr and Nelson Mandela. Pls check the following quotes made by great black leaders: \"If humanity is to progress, Gandhi is inescapable. He lived, thought, and acted, inspired by the vision of humanity evolving toward a world of peace and harmony. We may ignore him at our own risk.\" ~ Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \"He was no ordinary leader. There are those who believe he was divinely inspired, and it is difficult not to believe with them\" ~ Nelson mandela ",
