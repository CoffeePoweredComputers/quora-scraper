            "answer_text": "Psalms are hymns. Many used to believe that they were all (or mostly) written by King David, but we know this to not be true. Although David can be credited with the largest number of them (about 70), the Psalms were written by a large variety of writers over a long period of time. When compiled into what we now know as the Book of Psalms, they weren\u2019t laid out in chronological order, either. The first one, chronologically, is believed to be written by Moses and is numbered as Psalm 90. The song he sung there very closely mirrors the one recorded in Deuteronomy 31 and 32. The last one, chronologically, is believed to be written by Ezra, and is numbered as 147. Ezra has a book of his own in the Old Testament, in addition to the belief that he wrote the books called the Chronicles (this isn\u2019t known for certain, but there is much evidence that points to this). Many other Psalms were \u201csigned\u201d by those that wrote them, such as Asaph, a musician who lived during the time of David. There were definitely more Psalms written during David\u2019s lifetime than at any other time. ",

            "answer_text": "Tradition has it that king David compiled the book of psalms: Moses gave [Israel] the five books of the Torah, and to correspond with them David gave them the Sefer Tehillim [the Psalms], in which also there are five books. (PSALMS - JewishEncyclopedia.com) Neither protestants (including evangelical Christians) nor Catholics seem to believe this anymore. They instead think of the Psalms as a compilation of psalms composed over a period of hundreds of years (maybe a millennium): Scholars also note that the psalms attributed to David may have originated or been associated with David but may have also included assistance from others. In total, at least eight authors are named, and other anonymous writers certainly would add to this total. Interestingly, the Psalms were written over nearly a 1,000-year period ranging from the lifetime of Moses in the wilderness (1440\u20141400 BC) to Ezra (fourth century BC). Most psalms were composed during the lifetimes of David and Solomon. (GotQuestions) Seventy-three Psalms are attributed to David, but there is no sure way of dating any Psalm. Some are preexilic (before 587), and others are postexilic (after 539), but not as late as the Maccabean period (ca. 165). The Psalms are the product of many individual collections (e.g., Songs of Ascents, Ps 120\u2013 134), which were eventually combined into the present work. (Catholic Study Bible) The common opinion is that one \u2013 or more \u2013 anonymous editor(s), who lived after the death of king David, compiled the current book of Psalms (Catholic Study Bible; GotQuestions; Kaisar, Einleitung in das Alte Testament, \u00a7 31). The compilation happened sometime after the Babylonian Captivity ended. ",
