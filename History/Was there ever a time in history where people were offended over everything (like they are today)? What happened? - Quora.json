            "answer_text": "Do you have any evidence to support your claims that \u201cpeople\u201d are \u201clooking for reasons to be offended over everything?\u201d \u201cEverything\u201d sounds rather hyperbolic \u2014 I have not met anyone whose feathers have been ruffled by breathing air or standing. Surely you may better qualify the premise of your question, since its purview is woefully vague and unhelpful. Yes, offense occurred in the past; it is a sentiment so pervasive in human history and so conducive to intellectual diatribes, as well as the more rebarbative plagues of war and genocide, that even beginning to recount examples of it would be a perfunctory and tedious endeavor. Let the Iliad be your guide to the antique expression of offense and the petty defense of honor for little practical gain. \u201cSing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another.\u201d It sounds pretty petty to have men\u2019s souls hurled down to Hades and have the Achaeans experience \u201ccountless ills\u201d on account of a wrathful man who accuses Agamemnon of being tyrannical and unfair. You should see Book IX! The entire epic is essential a counterpoint of petty bickering, grave human sacrifice, and acts of humanitarian compassion occurring amidst the context of a dreadful nine-year war. The Iliad is a concatenation of disagreement and offense, one which profoundly and overwhelmingly attests to the enduring power of pathos and pettiness in shaping the course of human events. Your question is not even wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of human history, we\u2019ve been thin-skinned about anyone who thinks, talks, looks, worships, trades, eats, drinks, dresses, smells, plans, hunts, farms, builds, etc. differently in even the slightest degree from ourselves. It\u2019s why most culture\u2019s word for \u201cStranger\u201d is the same word as \u201cEnemy.\u201d It\u2019s been a real curse to the human race making family and marriages much more difficult let alone neighborhoods, church congregations, businesses\u2019 dealing with customers/suppliers/employees/competitors/regulators/taxers, communities with each other, centers of government with everybody else, and nations with each other. Exacerbating and pointing out those differences has always been an easy way to protecting oneself and accessing more opportunities while the now dismayed are distracted, the Romans called the strategy \u201cDivide and Conquer\u201d. That built and sustained their empire for nearly 2,000 years (longer if you consider the Roman Catholic Church the surviving version of Rome\u2019s government.) Defining other groups as substantially less human beings than one\u2019s own group has always been an odd license to abuse them, enslave them, rob them, oppress them, and often to outright kill them. That probably goes back to the many thousands of years when there were 4 or 5 species of humans (Cro Magnon, Homo Habilis, Neanderthal, Denosovian, \u201cHobbits\u201d\u2026) directly competing, interbreeding, and inbreeding (to reinforce differentiating traits and selective adaptations to the local area\u2019s environment, called \u201cracial differences\u201d as another sly way to divide and conquer \u2018others\u2019.) Along with \u201crace\u201d, specifically how my group worships which gods compared to your group (and frequent splintering within my own group over this too) has been one of the endless areas of contention. It\u2019s less intense than it has been in millennia but ask Sunnis vs. Shia Muslims, Syrian Christians vs. Syrian Muslims (or the Bosnian war) and much of the Cold War was the Communists\u2019 direct rejection of religions in general (being a religion itself) that upset all of the other religions from Russian Orthodoxy to Southern Baptists. The current spate seems to be greatly amplified and obvious thanks to the new Social Media channels on the World Wide Web, replacing quiet muttering in person or over a telephone, letters, or mass media presentations to a passive audience. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s more intense or that people are more self-centered and oblivious than in the past (an unfortunate constant as well), it\u2019s just more obvious. ",
