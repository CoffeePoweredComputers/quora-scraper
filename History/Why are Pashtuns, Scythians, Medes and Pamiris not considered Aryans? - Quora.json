            "answer_text": "The Aryans were middle Bronze Age Indo-Iranians who migrated from the region where the Tazabagyab-Bactriana-Margiana Archaeological Complex is located into Eastern Iran, Northwestern India and Syria. The people that migrated to Northwestern India were the Rigvedic Aryans, the people who invaded Syria were the Mitanni Aryans and the people who remained in the region were the Avestan Aryans.  The Pashtuns, Scythians, Medes, Pamiris alongside other Neo-Iranian groups are late Bronze Age Indo-Iranians. They descend from the people of the Yaz I, II and III cultures. The people who migrated from the Tazabagyab site migrated to two locations: the site known as Yaz and the region of the Bactriana-Margiana Archaeological Complex. The people who migrated from the Tazabagyab site to the Bactriana-Margiana Archaeological Complex formed the people of the Tazabagyab-Bactriana-Margiana Archaeological Complex (Aryans.) From that region they migrated to Northwestern India and Syria. The Pashtuns, Scythians, Medes, Pamiris are descended from the people who migrated from Tazabagyab to Yaz. Yaz proliferated Yaz II, which then led to the migration of Indo-Iranian peoples to six regions to form six new Iranic peoples: the Medes, the Parthians, the Scythians, the Persians, The Bactrians and the Sogdians.   The Aryans were an older Indo-Iranian people and are simply the Rigvedic Aryans, Avestan people and Mitanni horse-chariotsmen. They shared a common culture, religion and language which these Iranian groups do not as they are late Indo-Iranians. In fact these Iranic peoples would go on to invade Aryan lands, ancient Sanskrit texts describe the wars and invasions fought in Northern India against foreign Iranic tribes. Sakas : ScythiansTusharas : BactriansParsus: PersiansPakthas: PashtunsHunas: HunsDasas: North IraniansAfter the Vedic Aryans settled in Northwestern India their religion, culture and language had become distinct from the other Iranian tribes. They were invaded many times by North Iranian tribes originating from the areas where the people of the Yaz II migration moved to. Their culture, religion and language was considered to have been much different from that of the Aryans who were flourishing in Northern India. In conclusion the Aryans are only the people of the Higher Hindu castes, the Parsis and Zoroastrians. As a final note Aryan doesn\u2019t refer to a superior race as Hitler discusses but merely a shared cultural heritage between the peoples of the Rigveda, the Avesta and the Mitanni. As all these peoples referred to themselves as the Arya (noble people.) Also the Aryans belong to same race as the Iranic peoples, as well as the rest of the Indo-European people, they all belong to the Caucasian race. ",
