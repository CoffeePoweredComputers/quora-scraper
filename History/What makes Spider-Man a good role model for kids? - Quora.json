            "answer_text": "The fact that Spider-Man is a reluctant hero and often feels overwhelmed by the huge responsibility he feels to help others makes him seem normal and relatable to kids. He lacks self-confidence and kids know exactly how that feels when they have to work through their own doubts to accomplish their ends. The idea of knowing the right thing to do and having to muster up the courage to act on it is one many kids can understand. In the end, Spider-Man steps up and saves the world, but it wasn\u2019t effortless and kids appreciate that concept. Kids experience similar (although, perhaps, not world-ending) situations in their everyday lives. The kids all know they should stop the playground bully from targeting that nerdy kid, but it takes some soul-searching for them to finally make their move against the bully. They aren\u2019t assured their efforts will be successful, but they, like Spider-Man, feel compelled to try. The most important thing kids can learn from Spider-Man is that you don\u2019t have to be an invincible Super Hero to make a difference. Ordinary, scared-out-of-their-minds people can, and do, successfully and, often in small ways, save the world, every single day. Spidey is my favorite! I want to bring him home, give him milk and cookies and welcome him into my \u201ctribe\u201d of grandsons! ",

            "answer_text": "Spider-Man is perhaps one of the most popular superheroes of all time, and for good reason.  Below, I\u2019m going to list why Spider-Man\u2019s a good role model (especially for children): Unlike most superheroes, Spider-Man was a teenager! This only helps to appeal to the younger audience.Not only was Peter Parker younger, but he was also a nerd! Most superheroes are cool people even when not saving lives, but Peter Parker is just a photographer.Peter Parker attends school, and struggles to earn money as a photographer. Again, not the ideal situation, making it easier to relate to ordinary life. Peter Parker indirectly gets his uncle murdered. I suppose this could teach kids how to cope with a lost (or look past guilt, and do great things), as Spider-Man essentially begins to help New York City afterwards.He became \u201cSpider-Man\u201d overnight. Most superheroes work in labs or were born with superpowers, but Parker over here just got bit by a spider! This essentially helps the idea of \u201cordinary people becoming super\u201d, allowing for children to dream about gaining powers.Parker lives with the line \u201cwith great power, comes great responsibility\u201d. His uncle says this soon before he passes away, and inspires Peter\u2019s to help other\u2019s widely. Peter Parker doesn\u2019t have parents visible, only uncle and aunts. This would perhaps appeal to orphans, or people who have a bad parent situation.You get to see Spider-Man learn how to use his abilities! It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re right there, learning along side him!The villains in Spider-Man are very awesome, but, little actual deaths occur when it comes to civilians. If you watch closely, the villains have a master plan, but never just kill people (unlike DC villains.)Almost contradicting the above point, the villains in Spider-Man are always clearly bad. It\u2019s always good versus evil, never any confusion of \u201chey, maybe the villain isn\u2019t so bad?\u201d(Yes, I suppose Sandman had a rather tragic story.)  Spider-Man earns little to no reward for helping people. In fact, the Daily Bugle accuses Spider-Man as being a menace. This teaches children to work without rewards.Spider-Man more or less, always tries to save everyone. He\u2019s pure of heart, and is one of the more innocent superheroes, especially in modern day stories. Hopefully I didn\u2019t miss too many other points! I think Spider-Man is a superhero designed for the youth, and ordinary people to enjoy. Regardless, I hope this answered your question. Thanks! ",
