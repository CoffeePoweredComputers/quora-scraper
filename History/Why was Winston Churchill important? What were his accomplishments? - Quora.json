            "answer_text": "Churchill is considered the greatest statesman in British history. He is most famous for leading the UK in WWII, the biggest crisis in the country\u2019s history. Churchill was alone among major British politicians in warning about the threat that Nazi Germany posed to Europe, and opposed Chamberlain\u2019s appeasement of Hitler. Churchill was validated when the war broke out, and the British turned to him. He became Prime Minister the day Germany invaded Western Europe. Hitler offered Churchill peace terms after France surrendered. Churchill convinced the War Cabinet to reject the terms, even though Germany was much more powerful than Britain. He did this because he believed he could build an alliance with the Soviet Union and the United States that would be strong enough to defeat Germany and liberate Europe. This is exactly what happened. Churchill is probably the single most important person in defeating Nazi Germany, which might be the most evil regime in modern history. Churchill had other important accomplishments. He was a beautiful writer and published more words than Shakespeare and Dickens combined. His Iron Curtain speech set the moral parameters of the Cold War. He also shaped British naval policy during WWI and was an advocate for Israel. Churchill also had failures. His WWI Gallipoli campaign was a disaster that almost ended his career. He is blamed (probably unfairly) for failing to respond to the Bengal Famine in India, which led to around three million people dying of starvation. He was a leading advocate for European colonialism, which is viewed on the wrong side of history from the 21st century. He also opposed Operation Overlord until shortly before it took place, which was the most important operation of WWII. ",

            "answer_text": "Churchill\u2019s greatest accomplishment was blocking Hitlers path to total victory in the west, by refusing to surrender in 1940, at a time when it seemed to everyone, and for good reason, that Hitler could not be stopped. Churchill\u2019s act of blocking Hitler, changed the course of the war. It bought for the world, a year of precious time to wake up to the danger & prepare for the titanic battle to stop Hitler from winning his war to dominate the world. Churchill\u2019s other accomplishments, like bringing the Americans onside, were important too, but thereafter, his contributions to the direction of the war, were fairly patchy, sometimes controversial amongst the allied leaders, & gradually overshadowed by American involvement.
