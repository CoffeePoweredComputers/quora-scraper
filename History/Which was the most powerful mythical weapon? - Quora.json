            "answer_text": "The Indian mythological texts mention weapons like Brahmastra and Pashupatastra, both of which are described as WMDs. While these things are rarely clear, it is evident that these weapons [called Divyastra or divine weapons] were supposed to cause widespread destruction and even bring about the end of times. Of course, there\u2019s no proof that ancient Indians had figured out nuclear fission or radioactivity or chain reactions; however these remain the most destructive mythological weapons I know of. ",
