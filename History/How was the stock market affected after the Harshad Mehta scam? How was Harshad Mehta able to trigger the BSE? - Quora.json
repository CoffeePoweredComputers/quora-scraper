            "answer_text": "The Biggest impact was initially triggered by Harshad Mehta. The immediate impact of the scam was a sharp fall in the share prices. The index fell from 4500 to 2500 representing a loss of Rs. 100,000 crores in market capitalisation. Though one may be tempted to blame the steep decline in prices on the scam, we think that the reason for this fall was not scam directly. Purely technically speaking, scam just resulted in withdrawal of about Rs. 3,500 crores from the market, which for a market of the size of Rs. 250,000 crores (at an index level of 4500) is a very small amount, and therefore should have little impact on the prices. There were however two major reasons for the fall, both related to the government's knee jerk response to the scam. First was the phenomenon of tainted shares which created panic in the market and second was the perceived slow down of the reform process which destroyed the very foundation on which the boom was based. We now take a look at both these factors. The government set up a special court and promulgated an ordinance with several draconian provisions to deal with the scam. Sections (3) and (4) of the ordinance attached the properties of all individuals accused in the scam and also voided all transactions that had at any stage been routed through them after March 31, 1991.Since the accused were active brokers in the stock markets, the number of shares which had passed through their hands in the last one year was colossal. All these shares became \"tainted\" shares, and overnight they became worthless pieces of paper as they could not be delivered in the market. Genuine investors who had bought these shares well before the scam came to light and even got them registered in their names found themselves being robbed by the government.This resulted in a chaotic situation in the market since no one was certain as to which shares were tainted and which were not.The government's liberalisation policies came under severe criticism after the scam, with Harshad Mehta and others being described as the products of these policies. Bowing to the political pressures and the bad press it received during the scam, the liberalisation policies were put on hold for a while by the government. The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) postponed sanctioning of private sector mutual funds. Implementation of some aspects of the Narasimham Committee recommendations on the banking system were also delayed. Some question marks arose regarding privatisation as the chairman of the committee looking into this ended up in jail on charges of involvement in the scam. The much talked about entry of foreign pension funds and mutual funds became more remote than ever.The Euro-issues planned by several Indian companies were delayed since the ability of Indian companies to raise equity capital in world markets was severely compromised.",

            "answer_text": "I am trying to summarize in simple and short way : The stock transfer mechanism was manual at the time of Harshad Mehta. When a bank has to transfer shares to other banks, it was done via bank receipts that the list of securities. It took time in the transfer. as a share broker, Harshad had this time to use the bank receipts for his own use in buying the shares to increase the prices, then selling to get out of the market and then returning the money and shares to the banks. So, he could do it successfully, till one day, his idea didn\u2019t work and he lost money in big way. he could not return the money to bank and all chain reactions got triggered. ",
