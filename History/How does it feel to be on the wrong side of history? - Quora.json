            "answer_text": "Can you give me an example of somebody who woke up one morning and said, \"I'm on the wrong side of history!\" I can't imagine this happening.  History isn't a given; it's a story that is written long after the moment by historians, all of whom have a point of view. It doesn't emerge until most of the protagonists are long dead.  History doesn't have a right side and a wrong side; it is multifaceted. And it changes constantly as time passes and new people write about what happened. You don't like today's history? Wait a few years; the opposite view will likely come into vogue.  I'm going to make a rash statement: The only people who think history has a right and a wrong side are those with extreme political viewpoints, who strongly believe in the rightness of their own views, and who believe those who think differently are wrong, or dupes, or evil.  Kind of sounds like Washington these days, doesn't it? ",
