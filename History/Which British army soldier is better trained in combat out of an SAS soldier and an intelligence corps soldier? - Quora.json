I assume you\u2019re the same individual who\u2019s been spamming Quora with all manner of silly questions about the Int Corps; for the avoidance of doubt, the Corps does an interesting and vital job (just as the rest of the Army does), but no-one would ever claim it as a hotbed of underwater knife fighting ninjas. The Int Corps role is not close combat. ",
