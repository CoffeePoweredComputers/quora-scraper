            "answer_text": "We The People elected Reagan in his 1st landslide election because Jimmy Carter allowed the Iran hostage crisis to destroy his presidency and his legacy. America was in search of a strong leader. Reagan promised to fill that role and most agree he made good on this promise. President Reagan is known mostly for restoring pride and confidence in America after America's failures of the Vietnam War, Watergate, and Jimmy Carter's disastrous presidency via Iran hostage crisis and economic \u201cmalaise\u201d. Contrary to what the Democrat body politic haters say, Reagan's supply-side economics and \u201ctrickle-down\u201d approach were successful, exponentially more so than Carter's economic plan. Reagan's greatest achievement, by far, is that he brought down the Iron Curtain and won the Cold War without ever even firing a shot. Young people don't understand what a menace the Red Menace was. His peace through strength military approach is transcendent and revolutionary. Even today, leaders all over the world respect him for that. On the down side, late in his presidency, Reagan overstepped his executive power and got mired in the Iran Contra mess. Also in 1983, 241 marines died in the Beirut Barracks bombing. Liberal democrats have always tried to undermine the Reagan economic legacy by saying that the income gap between rich and poor increased which is true but I see that as a natural sequence of the American experience. Income redistribution is not the responsibility of the government\u2014laws guarantee equal opportunity, not equal outcomes. Here is a link to an apolitical website that gives a good summary of the Reagan 80s: The Reagan Era Reagan wasn't perfect but he was the best president since Lincoln. I make a motion that we carve his likeness into Mount Rushmore ",

            "answer_text": "Reagan was the last century\u2019s greatest con-artist. He motivated the most uneducated voters of that generation to come out and vote because he convinced them that if we turn millionaires into billionaires, their obscene wealth will turn them into saints and they will immediately want to give you a job by allowing you to clean their toilets or serve them drinks. No\u2026they won\u2019t buy more vacation homes in southern France or a larger yacht or have more champagne parties or build a factory in China\u2026they will want to give you a job. It took and still takes some serious dumb to vote for anyone that touts Reagan as a good President. Reagan\u2019s trickle-down economics has been America\u2019s greatest failure since 80% of all new jobs are actually created by a $15,000 to $20,000 working-class savings account\u2026a mom and pop restaurant, flower shop, real estate office etc\u2026and not by billionaires\u2026who have lost their incentive to innovate and create. The goal of the rich is to preserve their wealth and monopolies without innovation or hard-work. The government creates 10% of all new jobs and the rich create the last 10%. And the rich use public stock (your retirement account) when they do create any jobs, so they take zero risk and your stock portfolio loses when they bankrupt that company. Since Reagan, income inequality is the worst since the Great Depression or even the Gilded Age. USA upward mobility is now worse than Brazil. Reagan\u2019s (and the GOP) trickle-down and destruction of unions has given American workers\u2026the people who actually create the wealth\u2026an AVERAGE $16 an hour wage for 25 years STRAIGHT (at most a 1% increase) while the owners multiplied their incomes by FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT. Even today\u2026people still believe his scam and vote for people like Trump who is a trickle-downer on steroids. ",
