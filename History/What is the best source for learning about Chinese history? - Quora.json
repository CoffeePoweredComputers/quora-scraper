            "answer_text": "Follow these instructions exactly and you will find what you seek. Part I: Language acquisition.  1.) Spend 2 years learning the Chinese language 8 hours per day 6 days per week. Once you have achieved proficiency advance to step 2. 2.) Begin educating yourself in classical Chinese(that is the literary language of China during the Imperial era). This step is critical if you hope to decipher anything written before the modern era. Since classical Chinese itself evolved over its several thousand year history you will also need to make sure to learn each period\u2019s version of it. 3.) Teach yourself no less than 8 East and Central Asian languages including the following: Manchu, Cantonese, Uyghur, Tibetan(preferably ancient varieties), Mongolian(including preclassical, classical, and modern Mongolian), and Korean(especially ancient Korean) among other languages. After you spend the first half of your life acquiring the literary comprehension skills required to begin deciphering many articles of Chinese history, congrats! You can probably read a good amount of premodern Chinese materials. Part II: Archaeological digs  1.) Raise money to go on an expedition to uncover China\u2019s past. Go to universities like Oxford, Harvard, Cambridge, Yale, etc, and also try to hit up big donors like Mark Zuckerburg(who likes China), Jack Ma, and others who have some interest in China and are also wealthy enough to finance you. 2.) Get on the side of the Chinese government. The Chinese government is very restrictive of foreign professionals coming to China, especially if you are going to discover their history. The government will probably tell you that Chinese archaeologists are better suited for the job. At this point you show them that you know many of the languages of China and demonstrate proficiency in modern Mandarin Chinese. Send them a check for several million dollars, financed by your donors, and then promise to keep all of the artifacts in China. After all you are someone in search of knowledge correct? Not a treasure hunter. 3.) Hire a team of the brightest minds in the world to help you. You will need people who specialize in paleontology, zoology, ancient Chinese civilizations, radiocarbon dating, Chinese military history, you will probably need at least one botanist, and in addition to your linguistic skill levels you will probably need multiple other translators, because realistically are you going to have time to translate everything? Probably not. You will also need a network of thousands of archaeologists around the world in the event that you discover something unexplainable. If you discover a premodern Chinese cannon for instance, you might want someone who specializes in ancient gunpowder weapons to come take a look at it. 4.) Once you have assembled your team you all need to actually go to China and start sweeping the entire country for archaeological evidence of the past. Every once in a while in China you have normal farmers and kids find remarkable pieces of history, as evidenced in the article below. You want to find as many of these type situations as possible. Chinese boy stumbles across 3,000-year-old bronze sword after he put his hands in a river to wash them 5.) Every time you discover something remarkable start a dig in that region for more things. The terracotta army was discovered by chance when a farmer stumbled upon a small piece of it. There could be other great wonders like this hidden below the surface, so every time you find something you must be sure there isn\u2019t more to it. 6.) Record everything with exact precision. You need to have multiple people translate a scroll or piece of pottery to ensure you are copying the right thing. You need a warehouse to store all of the materials in, and many scribes and bookkeepers to help you keep track of the scrolls and materials. Eventually after a while doing this, possibly hundreds or thousands of years, you will have uncovered everything about China and can comfortably talk about the topic whenever you want. Fortunately for you in this day and age normal people don\u2019t need to go through the above to understand Chinese history. There was a time where that was pretty much the only way to go about learning Chinese history, but today we have hundreds of years of archaeological digs to look back on. You can thank early modern archaeologists from both China and the West for their contributions to the puzzle of Chinese history, they have worked for hundreds of years to uncover Chinese history so you don\u2019t have to. Now I can present to you the culmination of hundreds of years of work. Below are several very good reads that draw on the past several hundred years of uncovering China\u2019s history. Reading all of these is a much more efficient and time saving way to understand Chinese history. These books aren\u2019t perfect and don\u2019t include the full history of China, but they are the culmination of hundreds of years of archaeological work in China. These books are essentially written with what information we have regarding China\u2019s history. We don\u2019t have everything, but a lot of people in the past have done the above steps and over years of archaeologists doing this we have reached the knowledge level that we have now.

Ropp: Books There are so many good reads on Chinese history that I can\u2019t list them all, but the above are some that I\u2019ve either heard good things about, or read myself. You could also just teach yourself Chinese like I did and read Chinese history books. If you want to get a Chinese perspective on the matter, that\u2019s probably the best thing you could do. Realistically though If you want to learn about China you must understand the Chinese language. There is no plausible way to even begin understanding China without learning Chinese and getting the Chinese perspective. Of course as I highlighted in another answer you will never understand everything about China or it\u2019s history. The country is just too vast and too diverse for one person to completely wrap their head around. John Garrison's answer to What is the best way to know China? ",

            "answer_text": "People who study history probably start out by reading history books by other people. Unfortunately for them, not all history books are accurate. Also, it has long been observed that it is the victors who write the histories of wars.  Every history has to be a work of interpretation. The alternative would be a massive compilation of all of the extant records from some period and some region of the world.  The study of Chinese history from original sources is, generally speaking, a very well-supplied field. From the earliest times, Chinese people in government have almost obsessively kept records, boiled the records down to summaries, etc. So if one really wants to know what was going on in 833 A.D., one could find lots of things to read about that one year and then read out from the margins to get a better idea of the general context that the yearly data fits into. On the other hand, if the people who were interested in recording things considered something you are interested in to be irrelevant, there may be no deliberately made records.  Then you may end up looking for clues in strange places.   ",
