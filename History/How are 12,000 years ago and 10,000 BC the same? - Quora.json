            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a relevant joke: Some tourists in the Museum of Natural History are marveling at some dinosaur bones. One of them asks the guard, \"Can you tell me how old the dinosaur bones are?\" The guard replies, \"They are 3 million, four years, and six months old.\" \"That's an awfully exact number,\" says the tourist. \"How do you know their age so precisely?\" The guard answers, \"Well, the dinosaur bones were three million years old when I started working here, and that was four and a half years ago.\" It\u2019s currently 2018 AD. 10,000 BC is 12,018 years ago, not 12,000 years ago. However, that\u2019s a difference of a fraction of a percent. And since we don\u2019t have anything vaguely resembling a calendar that old, and every date we have has a margin of error built in, saying that any specific event took place 12,000 years ago rather than 12,018 years ago is claiming a false precision like the one the museum guard above is using. We may as well use the round number. ",
