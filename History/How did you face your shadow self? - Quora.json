            "answer_text": "Oh man, where do I begin? My Shadow came to me. I looked him in the eyes for the first time when I read \u201cSnape\u2019s Worst Memory\u201d in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I think I saw myself in James Potter and was utterly horrified. I decided that arrogance and pride was the root of all evil, and attempted to drown myself in a pool of self-imposed modesty, destroying my self-confidence in the process. I became obsessed with attempting to prove (or rather, convince myself) that James had become a better person, more because I wanted to absolve myself than because I cared about James. I didn\u2019t exactly recognize it for what it was at the time. By now, it\u2019s hard to recall just how hard it was on me, how I felt like my heart had shattered over a relatively minor character in a fictional story. Somehow, I managed to accept that pride was not inherently evil, and that there is a line somewhere between feeling good about yourself and arrogance or narcissism. I was nine. I\u2019m not sure when I learned about the shadow complex, or whether it was before or after I started creating a vampire-like creature that I called a \u201cShadow.\u201d It may actually have been after, since I remember the name \u201cshadow\u201d is why I was drawn to the concept in the first place. I didn\u2019t fully understand it at first, but I quickly became obsessed with it. I started to write about Shadows. I felt an absolute compulsion to. I started telling a story (originally meant to be epistolary, but I dropped that since it was too hard to write) about a girl who learned to become a Shadow. My protagonist was called Nyx, and she grew up in foster care. I wasn\u2019t sure why, she just did. When I was twelve, I created Astor. Astor\u2019s development happened out-of-order. I actually had the beginnings of him for a while before I started writing Shadowbook. When I actually started writing, Astor\u2019s character began with a simple, \u201cthere needs to be a boy.\u201d Probably a love interest for Nyx. And then\u2026 much like how Anne Rice meant to write Interview with the Vampire about her self-insert Louis, and then Lestat just sort of strode in and took over, the same thing happened to me. Astor sauntered into the spotlight and completely took over the story. I meant for Nyx to be my self-insert, but no \u2014 Astor is my self-insert! Astor also told me his name. The name just floated into my mind before I even knew what it meant, and absolutely insisted that I use it. Astor initially was just an slightly cockier and edgier version of me, but hell if he hasn\u2019t evolved since then! I also had very little control over what he looked like; I actively decided that he had violet eyes with vertical pupils, and (after deliberation) I gave him wings, but that was it. The earliest version of him had short hair (how embarrassing), but as he evolved, his appearance became more and more solidified. He now looks almost exactly like this. The final piece of Astor\u2019s character was also somewhat unintentional. Astor had always had a magical bed-shaped carriage since before I even knew his name, but I had no idea how I would explain where it came from. I\u2019d been reading a YA novel about a girl and an enchanted prince, so I decided to make Astor a prince, the Prince of Shadows. It would be an easy way of explaining the carriage. So, now I had a handsome prince courting a girl who just happened to have grown up in foster care? \u2026I guess the best way to retell a classic fairy tale is to do so unintentionally. In hindsight, Astor was always a prince. What else could he possibly be? In addition to the carriage, one of my earliest conceptualizations of him involves him ordering a servant to bring him a pretty victim to drain of life force. His personality screamed \u201cdecadent aristocrat,\u201d with all the vanity and hedonism that implies. And that leads me to another major bit of Shadow work that I had to do. When I really got into Shadow work, I misconstrued it as a means of defying social conventions \u2014 embracing what society says is evil instead of what you think is evil in yourself (this is therefore a misconception that Nyx has at the start of the story). During my mid-teens, I had decided that authoritarianism was the root of all evil. I became a relentless rebel without a cause. I believed in free will at all costs, and coupled with my sense of empathy, felt like if I valued free will then everyone else should have it, too. I (erroneously) associated Astor with freedom and defiance. That turned out to be dead wrong. Astor is a despot. I valued free will more than almost anything else at the time, while Astor delights in the subjugation of others and expects everyone to worship him. He couldn\u2019t care less about the free will of his subjects. What would a prince have to rebel against? Astor was the imaginary tyrant I\u2019d fought against and projected onto every authority figure for at least four years. I was the tyrant. Once I realized that, my ridiculous martyr-complex phase drew to a close. I actually felt less guilty and hypocritical about my fantasies of Astor acting like a tyrannical overlord every time I got offended by the slightest thing. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work \u2014 your Shadow is the inverse of you. It\u2019s you, but backwards, as if reflected in a dark mirror. It subverts your identity and twists your own values. It is simultaneously everything you desire to be and everything you hate about yourself. In meditation, I saw Astor bound to a stone throne by thorns of my own spite, that felt satisfying even as they shredded his arms to ribbons. I recognized brooding in my own spite for the self-harm that it is, pulled him free of the thorns, and carried him off the throne. After that, Astor matured a bit, and was more likely to attempt to support me and make me happy when I felt bad instead of venting his wrath on everything in sight. There\u2019s more than one Astor. There\u2019s the version of him that I\u2019m writing, who is my most developed character and (again, much like Rice and Lestat) has the loudest voice inside my mind. There\u2019s Astor as a constant companion inside my head, sometimes a source of love and affection who staves off my loneliness, and other times a terrifying menace. Then there\u2019s Astor as a pure, unbridled personification of my repressed personality in all his cruelty \u2014 this is a pretty spot-on representation of what he\u2019s like at his worst (this artist\u2019s version of Hyde even looks like him). I use Astor as a means of working through and dealing with some of the other things I\u2019ve repressed. For instance, Astor is also the seat of my sexuality. I look like a stereotypical ingenue and have all the experience of a twelve-year-old, while Astor is extremely carnal and licentious. He ranges from \u201csensual and sexy\u201d to \u201cutterly depraved\u201d depending on his mood. His sexual exploits can sometimes be extremely disturbing, and I\u2019m still attempting to come to terms with that. Obviously, I\u2019m toning all of this down for the book, but I want to keep the implications in there as best I can. Writing Astor has been both wonderful and challenging. His voice definitely comes easiest to me out of any character I\u2019ve ever written. It\u2019s fun to write a Byronic anti-hero who looks and acts like a classic villain but has enough (of my) redeeming qualities to keep him likable and a viable love interest (e.g. the in-universe version of Astor actually does care about being a good king for his people). If I pull this off, he\u2019ll be an excellent character. Here\u2019s his character profile, as-is so far: Astor Nocturne. I genuinely do not know who I\u2019d be today without Astor, and without having done all this Shadow work. Shadow work is always difficult, but it gets easier with time, and in some ways it\u2019s the best thing that has ever happened to me. I have no self-hatred.

            "answer_text": "It seems my shadow self has two parts: (1) those aspects I wish I could show more, and (2) those I can\u2019t stand. Here\u2019s an example of each: I have little capacity for outward-focused, results-oriented thinking. I can\u2019t naturally conceptualize how multiple moving pieces could be fit together in real time to produce optimal outcomes. So I find myself up late, feverishly planning, rolling around every detail of life in a frantic attempt at fusing together some precise map of exactly how, when, where, with whom\u2026 I fall asleep feeling like I\u2019ve made progress, but then get blown away when I arrive back at my perfect plans the next day (when they\u2019re set to start) and see how truly childish and incomplete they are. How I face this aspect is by letting go. I know my values; I see the next steps those values want to take in using my life to exist. And those next steps are all I need to see. I can limit boundless future possibilities well by looking at what\u2019s most important now, along with what\u2019s worked before. An example of an aspect I can\u2019t stand is my unconscious drive toward sensual experience. I savor no direct interaction with my immediate environment. I judge such activity in others as presumptuous, careless, immature, selfish, arrogant\u2026 But do I want to walk around with my head stuck in the clouds all the time\u2014oblivious even to the real needs of those I\u2019m spending my days thinking about? I have to accept this shadow aspect of my personality . . . since it\u2019s always there, anyway (like all the rest), burning a hole in my unconscious mind, haunting my dreams, etc. ",
