            "answer_text": "The two subjects or areas of knowledge are quite similar in some ways, and yet different in so many other ways. History is the study of events which had occurred in the past and the time and places when they occurred, and it is based on written records of the events and the people involved. Anthropology, on the other hand, is the study of the people who lived at a particular time and place and how they interacted among themselves and also with their surroundings.Anthropology is often based on biological evidence like skeletons, or artifacts discovered in the particular location,rather than written information or records. It is based on written records but more emphasis is given to artifacts or other archaeological evidence about the particular group of people being studied. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=16&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjWiMm_pLDgAhXBOI8KHc9VB1YQwqsBMA96BAgAEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJ5aglbgTEig&usg=AOvVaw0QA05YlE5ja9dG1yJwmhQ- History is often taught at schools and colleges, and is a common subject in the junior years in school. But,anthropology isn\u2019t. It has to be taken as a subject in the Bachelor\u2019s or Honour\u2019s level or at the Master\u2019s level. It is not a compulsory subject at most schools. And people other than who study it have often difficulty in understanding it or appreciating it.History studies the time and place of particular events and particular groups of people,and why they did what they did.Anthropology focuses more on the particular group of people to study how they did what they did,and how they affected the events which took place.

            "answer_text": "Anthropology includes a kind of contextual cultural history of every group we study. We very much need history to explore anthropology because we need to understand the context of the current cultural climate. Anthropology is unique among other humanities and sciences via three different elements. Cultural Relativism: We try to judge a cultural by its own rules and standards as opposed to applying our own prejudices and ideas. This of course does not mean that anything goes, but it does mean that things we think are weird are strange are the product of our own cultural upbringingCross-Cultural Comparison: This means that we look at the similarities and differences across cultures. Are there things that all cultures do? If so, how do they manifest. A good example of this is that the first things humans must do to survive is economic. So we have to gather food, create shelter and other means to survive, but that is really too broad to have any deep understanding of culture, so we instead look at how these things manifest and what are the similarities and differences across culture.Holism: This is the major difference between Anthropology and other schools of thought. We look at culture as holistic. This means that every element of culture relates to every other element of culture. For example when you add new technology (i.e. smart phones) it impacts every other facet of culture. Family life (Kinship), Politics, Religion, Gender, Race, Class and everything else are impacted by the new technology to some degree.So when we look at the relationship of history, we look at it from a holistic lens and from a variety of cultural viewpoints. But history is absolutely important in anthropology and much of what I read and study relates to history. So while there is a direct relationship, Anthropology uses a different lens to interpret the world. ",
