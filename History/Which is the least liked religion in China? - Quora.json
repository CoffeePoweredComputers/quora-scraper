            "answer_text": "Islam.  I know a lot of people will say Christianity, but that actually comes in second. Others would point out that including the phrase Falun Gong in this answer would get all Quora banned in China, but Falun Going is a spiritual practice and not a religion by itself. The officially athiest Chinese Communist Party (CCP) requires it's members to renounce religion, although there are closet religious practices, but it does not outright forbid the existence of religions. It does heavily suppress religion by censoring religious books (including cringy-worthy editions to the Bible), restricting the symbols and profession of faiths in public, requiring all religious institutions and preachers to have government licenses, and so forth. Basically everything but outright killing other religions\u2026 Unless you're Falun Gong, then you are both dead and erased from history. Why Islam? Well, the Uyghurs of Xinjiang province are a people that have been part of China off and on for literally ages, and are mostly Muslims. There is a real saparatist movement going on in that region, although it is impossible to tell how prevalent it is due to extreme internal travel restrictions in China and heavy press sensorship. What is known is there have been several major terror attacks over the past two decades involving gangs of knife wielding Uyghurs. It is impossible to even know if these attacks are connected to each other or the separatists. Of course in all this, the CCP equates anyone who is Muslim and not following all the rules with terrorists. They have specially built jails where any Uyghur or Muslim who does something like say \u201cEast Turkmenistan\u201d in public will be sent to for a few years and beaten until they sing the CCP's praises (which I mean quite literally). Now being Muslim in China alone won't get you anything except a whole lot of security checks which you might expect from a nation having trouble with extremism. But when China is by far the biggest user of state executions by any measure, and all that is needed to be convicted of terrorism is A) be Muslim or Uyghur and B) tell the cops the bug off then you might understand the problem. There are also some soft power methods being used that to anyone outside China would seem strange. The aforementioned internal travel restrictions mean there are guardposts and passes needed to go between certain provinces and localities in China, but it varies from place to place and from time to time. For a Uyghur to move to anywhere else in China, he must go through background checks and interviews. For a Hans Chinese to move to Xinjiang\u2026 that's it, he's approved. There are also a number of job recruitment methods being used to get Chinese from the more loyal provinces to move into Xinjiang. Xinjiang also has many of the harshest anti-religious laws, and even restricts many indigenous cultural activities and sponsors Hans and/or Communist activities in their place. This is why the CCP will avoid talking about Xinjiang while everyone else will call it \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d Because they don't aim to kill people but any activities or behaviors not in line with the CCP. To what extent there is a real insurgency going on, not even the Chinese government knows because of their own censorship apparatus. ",

            "answer_text": "Christianity I assume. The reason I say Christianity is because Muslims hate it as well. There was once the proposal in 2008 to forge an alliance between the CCP and Muslims in China against Christianity, though this was declined due to the secular nature of the party. The majority of Muslims aren\u2019t trouble makers. The trouble mainly comes from the failure to deal with the imams imported from the Middle East. Muslims are also not interested in spreading out to intervene in others\u2019 lives due to historical traditions. Christians, except Orthodox and Catholic, are however known for being the trouble makers. For example, in just the recent HK protest, you probably already see the mentions of which some protesters singing \u201cHallelujah\u201d. One of the main leaders \u4f55\u97f5\u8bd7 is a known Christian celebrity who refuses to consider HK part of China and has the famous scandal of selling her albums by removing the funds of the churches.  This woman \u6bdb\u5b5f\u975c also organized the crowd and appeared on the CNN.  She is a Christian who was famous for a case that she criticized the representative in HK legislative committee for presenting in Mandarin while she believed only English and Cantonese are allowed. Ironically she even put English ahead of Cantonese. Of course, the lying Western media usually wouldn\u2019t report those nasty parts but wash those characters and only leave the \u201cdemocracy\u201d, \u201cfreedom\u201d to you.  HK\u2019s case is more complicated but in the Mainland, the same phenomenon remains. Once a Chinese is a Christian, it usually means he/she is saying goodbye to most of the ancient Chinese traditions, including spring festival, ancestor honoring and etc even in the cost of breaking up with their entire families. Not shitting on Chinese tradition and history would be the minimum requirement and even \u201cmerit\u201d for them. Not only that, many of them have openly broken up the law and constitution by preaching in the public space, converting people under 18 years old, spreading their agenda in schools and so on. They also largely targeted at and taking advantages at the vulnerable people, including the old people, children the ethnic minorities in which they merge into genocide the culture of the latter, divide their relationship with the Han but spread out all their own nonsenses to substitute. Many of which have also taken funds from the foreign NGOs and involved in spy activities. This information is from the locker room talk of China\u2019s officials.  (Slogan from a Christian cult: \u201cthe perfect God would save human beings in 2012. Only those who accept the call can be saved. If one man refuses God, God would make him in hell. If a country refuses God, God would make this country disappear from earth\u201d). All of what I said is common sense which you can also observe in many other third world countries wherever the Christians missionaries and their uncle Chen or Tom are active. If the majority in the country aren\u2019t Christians, then Christians there would have the tendency to lead to the divergence and isolationism from the current society. Wherever the Christians land, the local traditions and customs are suddenly full of problems and need to be saved by them and their Western lordship behind. No doubt I heard some sources saying that the CCP has taken certain actions to \u201chandle\u201d their activities. Without the presence of CCP or assume we are still in the political atmosphere of 50-80s, I assume the angry Chinese would have taken their actions against those Abrahamic cults. ",
