            "answer_text": "In 1687, Newton observed that apples always fell straight to the ground rather than sideways or upward which inspired him to eventually develop his famous law of universal gravitation. It helped to explain why planets stayed in their orbits, why the Earth did not fall into the Sun and how the moon orbits the earth. He calculated the moon's motion using his theory of gravity. He changed the way we understand the Universe by establishing an universal law for all scientists. He expanded and unified the work of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler to better define the relationship between energy and motion. His laws of motion and gravity lay the foundation for modern physics.In 1665, when English scientist Robert Hook looked at a sliver of cork through his microscope, he noticed some \"pores\" or \"cells\" in it and became the first person to use the word \"cell\" to identify microscopic structures. Although what he saw was actually the dead cell walls of plant cells, he was the first scientist to discover and name the term \u201ccell\u201d. His discovery of \u201ccell\u201d hastened the course of modern cell theory from seeing the living cells first to seeing the nucleus in plant cell to the formally set up of Theodor Schwann\u2019s cell theory. Since then, people have been engaging in the exploration of life until today.On September 3, 1928, Before Alexander Fleming left for a two-week vacation, he noticed something unusual in a petri dish containing a staphylococcus culture left on a lab bench and never placed in the incubator as intended. The zone immediately around the mold, which was later identified as a rare strain of Penicillium notatum, was clear, as if the mold had secreted something that inhibited and prevented the bacterial growth. The active substance was later named \u201cpenicillin\u201d which is capable of killing a wide range of harmful bacteria, such as streptococcus, meningococcus and the diphtheria bacillus. Penicillin uncovered the veil of the antibiotic age. Before the introduction of this antibiotics, there was no effective treatment for infections such as pneumonia, gonorrhea or rheumatic fever. It saved everyone\u2019s life.Thomas Edison invented light bulb in 1879. It is constructed of a wire filament heated to a high temperature by an electric wave with a glass bulb surrounding the wire. Since then, everyone has used light bulbs to illuminate in the dark when they can do anything including walking down the street at night. Without light bulbs, we cannot live life as we know it.Alexander Graham Bell came up with a simple receiver that could turn electricity into sound in 1875. He came to the U.S as a teacher of the deaf, and conceived the idea of \"electronic speech\" while visiting his hearing-impaired mother in Canada in 1870. While trying to perfect a method for carrying multiple messages on a single wire, he heard the sound of a plucked spring along 60 feet of wire in a Boston electrical shop. Finally he figured out how to transmit actual speech over a wire. Since then, telephone has replaced telegraphy as the main communication channel. It makes it possible for a global economy in which businesses connect with each other and a stronger network of customers have been built all over the world. We can make appointments and communicate with our friends through telephone instantly. The early telephone has evolved into our today\u2019s wireless telephone and cell phone uses.In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick first formulated an accurate description of the twisted-ladder double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Using cardboard cutouts representing the individual chemical components of the four bases (A. T, C, G) and each phosphate group, deoxyribose sugar and nitrogen-containing base, Watson and Crick shifted molecules around on their desktops, as though putting together a puzzle. This seemingly small event opened an era of modern molecular biology with ground-breaking insights into gene control of protein syntheses and life processes. Since then, recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, monoclonal antibodies and stem cell research have created today's multi-billion dollar biotechnology industry. It has greatly accelerated the processes of cancer investigations by identifying cancer at an early stage. It provides theoretical basis for medical research and applied treatments for human beings such as gene therapy. DNA fingerprinting has revolutionized forensic investigations by establishing a link between biological evidence and a suspect in a criminal investigation. It helps paternity testing by determining whether two individuals are biologically parent and child. The accomplishment of human genome project enables scientists to figure out how to use patterns in our DNA to study the course of human evolution and migration throughout history. DNA\u2019s stability and high information density capacity attracts computer scientists, geneticists, biochemists, and others to come together to develop it into an exciting long-term information storage material. It could be possible to store all of the world\u2019s digital data using about a kilogram of DNA!Sugar changed the world. Sugar started from a small event as being recognized as medicine in India in the 600s Common Era (CE). From Europe\u2019s middle ages of sugar plantations in Dominican Republic to Christopher Columbus\u2019s bringing the first sugar cane cutting to the America during his 1492 voyage to our daily usage as the condiments, sugar has been changing the world. It drove the bloody slave trade that brought millions of Africans to the Americas in middle passage beginning in the early 16th-century when manufactured goods from Europe were traded to the West African coast for slaves. The African slaves were shipped to sent to work on New World plantations of sugar colonies, and sugar, molasses, and rum were shipped from the islands back to Europe to be sold and other goods were brought to Africa to purchase more slaves to complete the \"Triangular Trade\". European powers such as Portugal, Britain, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Denmark\u2013Norway, Sweden, and Brandenburg, as well as traders from Brazil and North America, took part in this trade. Sugar cane shaped the history of every nation in the Caribbean, much of South America and parts of the Southern United States. Sugar boots the independence of America. Britain lost its 13 American colonies to independence in part because its military was busy protecting its sugar islands. The British planters lived in constant fear of revolt and demanded soldiers for protection between 1775 to 1783, resulting in the American victory of the Revolutionary War and colonists\u2019 independence from Great Britain. The United States of America began to form. How important was sugar cane in that time? In swapping sweet and profitable Guadeloupe for the barren, sugar-free wasteland of Canada, plus most of the land east of the Mississippi River, many Englishmen thought the King got a raw deal (10).Sources: Did an apple really fall on Isaac Newton\u2019s head?How Isaac Newton Changed the WorldBiography of Robert Hooke, the Man Who Discovered CellsCell Theory TimelineAlexander Fleming Discovery and Development of Penicillin - Landmark - American Chemical SocietyWas the lightbulb the greatest invention of all time?History of the Telephone and Communication with BusinessesThe Discovery of the Double Helix, 1951-1953Discovery of DNA Double Helix: Watson and Crick6 exciting ways that DNA is changing the world - HelixHow Sugar Changed the WorldSugar Changed the World Summary | SuperSummary",
