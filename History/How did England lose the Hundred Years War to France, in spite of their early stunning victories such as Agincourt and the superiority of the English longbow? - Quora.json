            "answer_text": "I'm not sure whether to answer the question as asked or critique it because I don't think England were ever in a position to win the war but France almost lost it. Firstly, France wasn't a united entity, consisting of Duchys only loosely aligned to the House of Valois, such as the Dukes of Burgundy, Brittany and Lorraine but also was supported by the Scottish King, Bohemia and crucially, Genoa, who held the purse strings for a lot of Europe at the time. At times, this was a fragile alliance and was subject to a French ruler who at times, made every possible mistake. But it's worth noting that France evolved over the course of the 116 year period of this conflict from a feudal state to a unified Kingdom. That led to them being able to come together as a single (ish) unit and finally see off the English challenge. England on the other hand was largely united against the French, if not entirely always supportive of its king, but simply didn't have the finances to fight the sustained war that was required. And I'm going to be really controversial and say that the longbow, while undoubtedly deadly, is overrated. Genoese crossbow men, protected by rows of Pavise shields, were just as deadly if used in the right way and the shield protected the crossbowmen from return fire.  (Figurine depicting Genoese Crossbowman and his Pavise shield) The long bow was fantastic as it could fire a bodkin arrow capable of piercing the plate armour of the French nobility, but its archers were generally laymen and over time, with changes in the economy in England and Wales (The longbow was as prevalent in Wales as in England) the number of archers capable of using a long bow declined. And as they weren't professional soldiers, this meant the long bow declined. And by the end of the war, guns were becoming more prevalent, changing the nature of siege warfare and surplanting arrows as the means of fear and mass destruction.  (Captured cannon from the Siege of Harfleur) And it also has to be said that while Agincourt was a famous victory, arguably THE victory that secured the long bows place in history, luck played a massive part. Had the weather held and the ploughed fields of Agincourt not turned to mud, and had the French attacked with all 3 armies at once and done so even a day earlier, the outcome would likely have been very different, long bows or not. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that the series of skirmishes and battles that made up the 100 years war never actually constituted a tipping point where it ever seemed likely that England would be victorious. And it's worth noting that while England was almost bankrupted following the war and went into a 30 year period of feudal decline until the establishment of the Tudor dynasty, France prospered and unified like never before.

            "answer_text": "Logistics were a big reason. The war was fought in France, but the supplies had to come from England. Every bow, arrow, horse, horseshoe, tunic, etc. had to be laboriously carted from its place of origin to an English port over roads that were for the most part mud tracks, hand loaded onto the comparatively small ships of the time, brought to a French port, hand unloaded onto other carts, then laboriously carted over dirt tracks to the English army, provided that the carters knew where the English army was, then unloaded. Of course, the English tried to subsist on the country. But as the vast majority of the ordinary soldiers did not speak French, and even the Anglo-French of the nobles had diverged from the dialects of the people, there was no way to talk to or persuade the locals to support the English king by voluntarily providing supplies. So the supplies were taken, if they could not be successfully hidden, and the local people stored up another grievance against the English. The English state was considered in that day to be one of the better-run in western Europe, but was barely up to the tasks involved in providing equipping, and (most of all) sustaining a large army on the other side of the Channel. Logistical and budget limitations constrained the size of the English army and shortened its fighting season. Battles are short and spectacular. Sustaining an army in an increasingly hostile country is long and boring. But if the English were going to win, that\u2019s what they had to do, and the mechanisms of the state available to them did not support the kind of effort needed. In essence, the English monarchs needed Roman roads, Roman methods of organization, and an army with Roman discipline to duplicate the feat of Caesar in taking what once had been Gaul. They did not have those things, and they failed. ",
