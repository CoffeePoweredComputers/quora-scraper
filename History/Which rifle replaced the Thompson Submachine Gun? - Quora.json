            "answer_text": "Other submachine guns, the M3 \u201cGrease Gun\u201d for suppressive fire and clearing buildings room by room but not the accurate semi-auto fire of the Thompson\u2019s wood stocks, longer barrel, and sights. The Reissig submachine gun was also used in quantity during the war. The Browning Automatic Rifle of 1918 and later Johnson select-fire rifle of 1941 may be what you\u2019re thinking of, both heavy to manage recoil and muzzle climb with the much longer range and more powerful .30\u201306 rifle cartridges. Thompsons were used up into the Vietnam era, users really liked them regardless of what armchair critics and cost accountants said about them. The Colt carbine version of the M-16, \u201cCAR\u201d (clever eh?) in the Vietnam era, mostly replaces submachine guns in combat as does the 6 pound M-16 itself and now the M4 carbine version. Some Special Forces, Embassy protection, and others used/use the Heckler & Koch series of submachine guns (M3, M5, M7). ",

            "answer_text": "Largely the M3 \u201cGrease Gun\u201d replaced the Thompson because of expenses in making the M1 Thompson. I heard Secret Service was carrying Uzis when President Reagan got shot. People looking for an SMG largely turn to the MP5 and it\u2019s still sort of the poster child of one. The MP7 is fairly popular as well. Now Secret Service uses the FN P90, a pistol caliber carbine dubbed a \u201cPDW\u201d(Personal/Personnel Defense Weapon) which seems to largely be firearms that would\u2019ve been considered SMGs not too long ago. This is based off what I heard so it may well be inaccurate now but it has merits and would serve well in defending the POTUS. Hope this helps ",
