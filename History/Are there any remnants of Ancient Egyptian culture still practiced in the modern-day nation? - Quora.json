            "answer_text": "Yes. Throughout Africa. Kemet (Ancient Egypt) was an African civilization. Therefore, when Africans are being themselves they have the closest aspects of culture related to the Remetch (people of Kemet). For example, this is an 18th Dynasty stela of an Asiatic man drinking beer. Now, how do they know this is beer? Well, because Africans still drink this type of beer using straws.   Which brings us to African pottery and the pottery of Kemet, it is exactly the same. The artifacts of Remetch pottery are the same types still made traditionally today throughout Africa.  Below Bambara/Bamana woman in front of a grinding stone (also a Kemetic artifact) with her clay pottery that is manufactured in the same fashion.  Hair extensions, afros, curls, locks are all still African as are the afro picks and curling sticks used to style African hair. Same tools and styles exist among Africans today. Maasai men wear braided hair extensions and/or braided wigs on various occasions. They are not the only Africans to do this. However, such braided styles for men and women existed in Kemet as well as still exists throughout Africa.   Man from the Congo of another ethnic group and his braided wig as he is paired with a Kemetic artifact of an older man with braided hair. Note the necklace is even the same.  Artifacts of braided hair bundles and a range of Kemetic hairstyles.   Jewelry. Much of the Jewelry of Kemet still exist as traditional African jewelry. This is a Xhosa necklace called Ingqosha that is familiar in Kemet.  This is not my collage but this emphasizes the above necklace is still African. Collage features a young Nelson Mandela in traditional Xhosa attire.  Boats. African boats in Kemet and now are the same.  A collage I made several years ago shows several African ethnic groups with reed boats that Thor Heyerdahl used as the basis to recreate his reed boats. The only non-African ethnic group producing such a boat are an indigenous population in Peru/Bolivia border area that Thor also consulted. However, in Africa, such boat making still exists from West Africa to East Africa.   These are only a few African connections but Kemet (Ancient Egypt) still most closely correlates to indigenous African culture and ethnicities throughout the continent as should be expected because it was an African civilization.

            "answer_text": "Pharaonic Egyptian culture was sharply modified by the Greeks and then the Romans, and then by pretty much everyone else who either invaded or simply immigrated in the past. (Egypt once had a thriving Jewish community who had no interest in living in Palestine; they were better off in Egypt. They invented double-entry bookkeeping.) The last surviving vestige of ancient Egypt is the Coptic Church, one of the earliest Christian churches to be founded. Its liturgical language, though written in Greek characters, is a descendant from the ancient Egyptian of the hieroglyphics. Coptic was instrumental in helping to decipher the hieroglyphs, and especially to know how they were pronounced. Copts still give their children the names of Egyptian gods. I once knew a man whose name was Osiris Gabriel (seriously). Copts also frequently work for the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, because of their connection to the past. But make no mistake, these are Christians, not worshippers of the ancient Egyptian religion. It's a little like the fact that we still use Greek and Roman names (Helen, Julius) and some people feel that ancient Greece or Rome are part of their heritage, but they don't actually live the way those peoples lived.

            "answer_text": "On a day to day level, parts of the language has loan words in modern Semitic Egyptian: Egyptian Arabic colloquial words from Coptic . Not sure how many were in use and pronounced the same way as was in the ancient days. Only two families still use it, but that may have been in part only Language revitalization - Wikipedia Coptic language's last survivors - Daily News Egypt \u201cI felt that Coptic was a worthless language to have my children speak, therefore I did not do so when they were young, said Zaki.\u201d \u201cMona Zaki is one of only a handful of people that continue to use the language in everyday conversation.\u201d \u201cwhen the members of the two families that speak the colloquial form of Coptic die, it will be the first language of the early Christian churches to become extinct.\u201d (the threatened Aramaic language - Wikipedia and Armenian are the other early people to adopt Christianity) Copts, like Palestinian, Syrian, Iraqi, and Lebanese Christians are leaving their homelands. Persecution of Copts - Wikipedia \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Also, the whole Ancient Egyptian language is still used in the Coptic Church. Sort of, as it changed considerably til the Arabs invaded in 642 AD, but far closer than modern day Egyptian, which is completely different derivative of Arabic from Saudi Arabia via conquest. Old Egyptian was Hamitic, and Arabic is Semitic . They are not as close as once thought and certainly are not intelligible between speakers. Old Egyptian and Coptic may have been intelligible, although there would never be any speakers of the two at the same era. Egyptian language \"Egyptian was spoken until the late 17th century AD in the form of Coptic. The national language of modern-day Egypt is Egyptian Arabic, which gradually replaced Coptic as the language of daily life in the centuries after the Muslim conquest of Egypt. Coptic is still used as the liturgical language of the Coptic Church. It has several hundred fluent speakers today\" Not sure if that qualifies as what you are looking for, but language is perhaps the most important part of culture in so many ways (e.g. the difference between French regions is small compared to the mile between France and Germany) Coptic \u2013 Living or Dead? \"So what is Coptic? The conventional answer is that it is the latest surviving form of the language of the ancient Egyptians, written using a modified Greek-based script; 20% of its vocabulary, apparently, consists of Greek loan-words. So it is at a distance from \u2018Demotic\u2019, the latest form of \u2018Ancient Egyptian\u2019, and it survives today only in the liturgy and literature of the Coptic Orthodox Church. However, as was realized by medieval Arabic scholars, and later by Athanasius Kircher among others, the (known) Coptic script expressed a language broadly similar to the (unknown) demotic and hieroglyphic scripts; and it was this insight which helped the decipherment of the Rosetta Stone.\" \"But to state that Coptic \u2018survives today only in the liturgy and literature of the Coptic Orthodox Church\u2019 is controversial. \u2018Copts\u2019 are today defined by their faith as Christians, and they seem to number anywhere between 5 million and 15 million in Egypt, with another 500,000 in the Sudan, and significant diasporas in the United States, Canada and Australia. \" \"However, of these, only a tiny number, estimated on this website http://www.copticassembly.org/showart.php?main_id=838 at under 300, actually speak the language as their day-to-day vernacular (probably a lesser number than the scholars worldwide who study it), and the same website seems to indicate that this revival is artificial to the extent that its proponent had to learn Coptic himself before teaching it to his family and descendants.\" Coptic alphabet  Not sure of the quality of this composite video, but seems to be close enough about showing current Coptic Egyptian, however misplaced the idea that Egyptian was a closely related language to points east:  ",
