            "answer_text": "I have not heard that anyone sent a personal copy of the Declaration of Independence to the king, but we know he read it a few months after its publication. An American expatriate was a witness: Benjamin West, the gifted American artist who had lived in London for more than a decade, happened to be painting the king\u2019s portrait when a courier brought in a copy of the Declaration of Independence. By West\u2019s account, George grew agitated, then silent before finally muttering, \u201cWell, if they cannot be happy under my government, I hope they may not change it for a worse.\u201d The cabinet had replied to Congress by hiring an Anglican deacon to write \u201cAn Answer to the Declaration,\u201d a windy, 132-page treatise of which eight thousand copies were printed and successively labeled as editions two through five \u201cto give the impression of widespread popularity.\u201d Atkinson, Rick.

            "answer_text": "Was one sent to George III? I imagine that a copy ended up with him, but it was mainly addressed by Americans to Americans justifying their actions. So it was sent to American newspapers and other outlets that would reach Americans. Copies may have been sent to garrison commanders in the 13 proto-states, with the implication that they would go up the line, and might well reach the king. But I doubt one was sent directly to him.
