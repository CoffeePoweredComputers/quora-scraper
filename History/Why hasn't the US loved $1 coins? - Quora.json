            "answer_text": "At one time they did love them and didn\u2019t trust paper money. Originally the dolar coins were overvalued and they were exported, so they stopped making them. but the spanish milled dollars were widely and eagerly accepted and used. Dollar coins were not a problem. In 1840 the silver dollar was once again made, and I believe that it was widely accepted because if you had to choose between a heavy silver dollar that you knew was good and was worth a dollar, or a paper dollar that was issued by some bank from who knows where that might be worth $1, or 90 cents, or 50 cents or even totally worthless, and which if worth something today might be worthless tomorrow which would you choose? The dollar coin obviously. You have to remember at that time there was no government paper money it was all \u201cprivate issues\u201d Then after the gold discoveries in California the value of silver rose and the dollar coins were now worth more as metal than as money. They got to the point where every time you used one you lost 4 to 8 cents in value. the weight of the smaller coins was reduced so you wouldn\u2019t lose money by using those so once again the dollar coin was shunned. If it was offered you would take it but you wouldn\u2019t use it. During the civil war the private paper money disappeared and federal paper was issued. All the gold and silver was hoarded so even though people didn\u2019t trust the paper money it was the only thing they had. After the war the value of the paper money as compared to gold and silver began to rise and by 1874 they were on par with each other. By this point the paper money was now trusted. this gave people three choices the tiny had to handle gold dollar, the big heavy silver dollar, or the light convenient paper dollar which they KNEW that at any time they wanted they could exchange at the bank for a gold or silver dollar. Well if you know you can get a \u201creal\u201d dollar for the paper whenever you want, why carry the inconvenient coins? Paper money took over. After all metal backing was taken away from the paper dollar you could still always exchange a paper dollar with no intrinsic value for coins of little to no intrinsic value, so the only consideration was that of convenience and the 1 gram paper dollar was a lot more convenient to carry and handle than the 22 gram or later 8 gram coin. So given a choice between the two people pick the paper note. The ONLY way to get people now to use a dollar coin, is to withdraw the note. the US government has tried to get them to co-circulate with no success since 1971. Most every other country has looked at out failure, introduced a small one unit coin and withdrawn the corresponding note, and everywhere it has been done it has been successful. It has consistently failed here because we keep trying to get both to circulate and they won\u2019t ",

            "answer_text": "Americans were more find of them in the past when coins (up to at least the $20 double eagles) were used for many transactions. By the time the large dollar coins (the last being Eisenhower dollars) were largely being phased out. Two dollar bills and actually using change were falling out of favor. When we tried to ressurect the use of one dollar coins, it wasn't done in a serious fashion. The government continued to print one dollar bills and only printed twos in small numbers. There was no reason for people to change their habits. ",
