            "answer_text": "At least as is recorded in the Bible, Jesus did not directly say anything about homosexuality. He did not need to, for He was ministering first to the Jews, who were well aware of God's stance on deviating from the opposite-sex context He gave for marriage. He ministered first to them as an observance of His Father's promise to Abraham, concerning the prosperity of his descendants. Yet God was not content with keeping the opportunity to covenant with Him, within the confines of Israelite lineage. This is why the Lord told His apostles to spread the ministry to the Gentiles / the nations. This is also why the apostles had to elaborate on homosexuality. The uninitiated Gentiles had to catch up on about 3,800 years of God's imparting His ways to His people of the old covenant. Yet they did not directly inherit Mosaic law, where every Jew and every Gentile/foreigner living among them had to stone offenders of \u2013 say \u2013 God's commandments against sexual immorality. The new covenant's believers' calling was unique. These believers were called to be more compassionate in their treatment of the sinner, yet even stricter in their treatment of the sin. That is, the believers of the new covenant were to stop fellowshipping with an unrepentant offender, rather than killing an offender regardless of repentance; though they were to do this also concerning impurities, and not just concerning immoralities. John 8:1-11 replaced Leviticus 20:13 as to the treatment of those who break Leviticus 18:22\u2026but the teaching of Lev. 18:22, and even the \"purge the evil from among you\"\u2020 commandment of Lev. 20:13, are still in effect. The apostles thus relied on God's Holy Spirit\u2014given to the original twelve at Pentecost, and thereafter to repentant disciples at the moment of baptism\u2014to expound upon the foundation of Christ for these believers. According to Jesus, both the Son (Himself) and the Father issue the Spirit: making what He the Spirit has written through the apostles, the Father's and the Son's words as well. This means that the canonical writings of these apostles on same-sex sexual relations must be treated as Jesus' words on them as well.  For those who wish to contend that Paul and Jude were not writing by the Spirit; or that they were always conveniently speaking about something else, we still have Jesus' direct teachings on the God-given context of marriage. Mark 10:1-12 (also in Matthew 19:1-9)\u2014 \u00b9Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. \u00b2Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, \u201cIs it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\u201d \u00b3\u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d he replied. \u2074They said, \u201cMoses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.\u201d \u2075\u201cIt was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,\u201d Jesus replied. \u2076\u201cBut at the beginning of creation God \u2018made them male and female.\u2019 [Genesis 1:27] \u2077\u2018For this reason a man will leave his father and mother (and be united to his wife), \u2078and the two will become one flesh.\u2019 [Gen. 2:27] So they are no longer two, but one flesh. \u2079Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\u201d \u00b9\u2070When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. \u00b9\u00b9He answered, \u201cAnyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. \u00b9\u00b2And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.\u201d As for Paul and Jude, the former made up a word from Greek stems just to drive home the point; while the latter described the sexual immorality of Sodom and Gomorrah as notable among the kinds of \"perversion\" they and their neighboring towns \"gave themselves up to\" (Jude 1:7). Though some debate the semantics of what aspect of Sodom and Gomorrah's attempted rape of the two angels sent to Lot was being referred to as sinful, their demands in Genesis 19:5 that refer to the angels as \"men\" indicates that they did not view them as angels. Their sexual immorality normally dealt with other men, and how God chose to manifest these angels to them accorded with their typical lusts. Similarly, people debate in which way ;\u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9;/;\u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2; (1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:10) meant \"(male) lyers with men.\" Was it all sex between men? Was it just anal sex? Why was sex between women unspecified? This kind of legalism Jesus detested, for the Pharisees and the teachers of the law used it to distort God commandments, by fabricating loopholes and then leaning on them. This kind of legalism is partly what made them a \u201cwicked\u201d or \u201cperverse generation.\u201d As stated before, God's people are called to follow the law beyond the mere letter\u2014and this calling is made all the more explicit in the new covenant in Christ. The method of sexual stimulation in male-on-male sex does not matter; and the wording in 1 Cor. 6:9 reflected active and passive / 'top' and 'bottom' dynamics because those were the only dynamics to such sex in that place and time. Also, intercrural sex, not anal penetration, was the socially mandated form of male-on-male sexual relations. Finally, the omission of women's sexually immoral pursuits was because the dowry system made it obviously counterproductive to their nubility, and thus to their continued sustenance and financial stability. Lesbian relations were simply not a popular vice in the Greco-Roman world, and are only mentioned in Romans 1:26 as a then normally unthinkable extent to this current deviance. Similarly, there were no non-hierarchical relations between men, at least that the Greek and Roman societies would have tolerated. Considering that even godly, one-man-and-one-woman marriages have a hierarchical structure of active (male) and passive (female)\u2021, the argument that God would simply ignore such a distinction if it were important, is flimsy and willfully tunnel-visioned.  I stress the folly of this lawyerly set of arguments not out of some apathetic vendetta against anyone who dares to challenge traditional interpretations; but because I, too, had once bought into these false arguments. I was taught by both of my (biological) parents that being against same-sex sexual and romantic relations automatically made one a hateful bigot. Ironically, though it made me want to be a 'straight ally' by most of the LGBTQIA+ community's very gatekept definition, this same tract is what kept me from recognizing I myself was queer and genderqueer. I could tell something was wrong about this way of thinking; about the rampant promiscuity, the encouragement of irreverence, the complete disregard for moral obligations to deal with one's sexual attractions and gender(s) appropriately. However, I could not put my finger on it, because I had been trained by the tone of this movement not to. The absence of prominent good role models for my bisexuality; my pansexuality; my (albeit mild) feelings of gender dysphoria kept me from being able to relate to their supposedly inclusive definitions. Only after I was willing to look at the truth of what God had to say on these matters, did He eventually bring me to a point where I was able to embrace these statuses, in the order mentioned. (I also identify as demisexual and demiromantic; but there was no closeting therein before I had heard of these classifications, and there is generally less aggression towards demi people from the same people who aggress better-known kinds of queerness or genderqueerness.) So, yes\u2014God made me to be sexually queer and genderqueer. How does that make my responsibility to adhere to Scripture any less than anyone else's? Moreover, the PRIDE movement was near powerless to help me come 'out'; and would have inadvertently kept me closeted all my life, had I kept refusing to surrender to God's pronouncements. That is not to say that it does not have some good insights amidst the bad: its prevailing social theories gave me names I could put to myself;homophobia, biphobia, aphobia, transphobia, intersexphobia, and other 'phobias' exist;too many hetero/cis people are content to avoid issues of LGBTQIA+ people's suffering, whether or not those people have been committing LGBTQI+\u2013specific sins;without non-binary activism, we may never have had the recent scientific studies equating trans-ness with intersex-ness of the brain (having both sexes' cells in it),etc. However, its gatekeeping of which LGBTQIA+ people the community will accept, and what forms of allyship or faith it will accept, is serving as a poison to the truer efforts towards the wellness of modern-day queer people. It is adulterating the good; and is obstinately keeping many straight people of faith from being allies, thus ensuring the persistence of the bad, more secular parts of heteronormativity. As a LGBTQIA+ disciple, I have a responsibility to stand up to both kinds of injustice; and to stick up for both Scriptural faith and empirical evidence, concerning how to treat different kinds of queerness. The militaristic approaches of indiscriminate heteronormatives and queer activists alike MUST. STOP. if they truly care for the spiritual welfare of LGBTQIA+ people.  EDIT: changed a sentence that seemed too tangential to the topic; chose more precise language \u2020\"You must purge the evil (person) from among you / from Israel\" does not appear in Lev. 20:13 itself; but is rather a recurring phrase in Deuteronomy (13:5; 17:7,12; 21:21; 22:21), referring many times to stoning and other capital punishments. There were also some offenses warranting banishment from God's community; though this phrase does not appear in their relevant commandments, the same moral theme applies. The latter sense specifically the apostle Paul cites in 1 Corinthians 5:13. \u2021I am not arguing that the husband always has to be active or 'top' in the marital bed, nor that the wife must always be passive or 'bottom.' Though the standard missionary position might be a good default way to observe this hierarchy, I believe that otherwise per vaginam and even per os sex can offer a holy variety to the opposite-sex married couple.

            "answer_text": "Firstly, we have no record of any word Jesus actually spoke. We only have the memories of those around him, probably recounted to others and these records, the Gospels, differ slightly and at times contradict each other. The gospels were written between thirty and seventy years after Jesus's death, which means that most likely they were not even written by eye witnesses of the actual events. Any holy book that is used as the foundation for a religion, must necessarily conform to the three main requirements for any successful religion i.e. any religion that survives through the ages. These are: a. it must provide an answer to three questions that permit of no rational answer: in the shortest form they are: where do I (the univers) come from, where will I (my deceased child, my husband who died before me) be after I die and, finally, what is the reason for my existence; b. it must have a set of seemingly unalterable commandments, that yet admit of adaptation and re-interpretation to relate to different times and different circumstances and it must not offer predictions that are verifiable; c. it cannot for a prolonged period of time be contrary to the interests of the ruling class. Whoever are in power will always adapt religion to their own purpose. Christianity is arguably the most successful religion ever. There are at this very moment, more Christians then ever before in history, there are more Christians than followers of any other religion and Christianity exists for nearly two thousand years. That means that the rules and commandments, exhortations, dogma\u2019s, teachings and catechisms must conform to the second requirement: the must appear to be immutable, yet flexible. In Christianity this is overly evident. From the same ground-book in ages past Christians have derived the justification of suppression of women and children, the killing even of women and children, holy wars, slavery and genocide. Yet, others have stressed love, charity and peace as the key values of christianity, with equal justification. The same goes for a sexual morale. Those opposed to homosexuality will mention the fact that Jesus, according to the Gospel, has said that he has not come to change the law, but to enforce it. That law was the Jewish set of laws as written in the Old Testament, the Jewish holy book. And they will turn to Paul\u2019s letter to the Romans to condemn homosexuality. Those words only pertain to male homosexuality, but can of course, at will be made applicable to women too. Those who do not feel the need to suppress the rights of homosexuals will stress the words attributed to Jesus to not judge, to love rather than to condemn. And, to directly answer your question, the word homosexuality, according to the Gospels, is never mentioned by Jesus. This dichotomy which is the unavoidable result of the requirements for a successful religion, is at the heart of all sexual morale derived from Scripture. It pertains to the position of women (the man is the head of the woman), divorce, birth control, the rights of children etc. If you look for unambiguous directions in a book that is necessarily ambiguous, you\u2019re on a quest that cannot be completed.
