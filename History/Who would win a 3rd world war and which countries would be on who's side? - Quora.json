            "answer_text": "It really depends on how the war starts. I\u2019ll assume a NATO-CSTO dispute somewhere. The map would look something like this:  The battle lines in Africa and Latin America are quite liquid, they could change quite easily. The countries in purple are the ones that could go either way, Turkey could defect to CSTO but they might part of NATO. The Philippines have in the past attempted to defect to China but their disputes in the South China sea stopped them, if the South China sea disputes are the cause of this war (which I think is quite likely) then the Philippines and the other nations around the Gulf of Thailand will side with America. Australia doesn\u2019t really like either side but does most of their trade with China, my guess is that they at least attempt to stay neutral. New Zealand will likely stay neutral either way but they might join one side or the other. Egypt, Palestine and Iraq are all coin tosses, either way Israel won\u2019t exactly have a fun time. Who would win isn\u2019t clear, the last big conventional war was ended by non-conventional weapons, the one before that was ended by one of the deadliest plagues ever and the one before that ended 203 years ago so isn\u2019t really comparable. There is effectively no end in sight for this war, only the smallest countries could ever be defeated and occupied. The Russo-European war would end with a slow, costly European advance into Russian territory, the Sino-Indian conflict would see small Indian gains into Myanmar ans slightly bigger gains in Pakistan while China makes small gains across the Northern border. South Korea could definitely beat North Korea by themselves but with the armies of China, the USA and Japan would need to help a lot. Taiwan would be alright for a number of reasons and huge naval battles would occur between the USA and China at the start of the war, towards the end the Americans would have achieved Naval and Aerial supremacy across in the East China, Yellow and Japanese seas. If South Korea is not taken within a few months, it never will. Africa would see movement only by Egypt into Sudan maybe and probably a guerrilla war in Kenya and Uganda. Latin America would see little fighting with the isolation of population centres and the many geographic challenges in between Argentina and anyone else. Nicaragua's Chinese funded Nicaragua canal would be the main source of competition for Panama\u2019s American funded Panama canal. Conflict would arise and the US may be able to take the canal zone. The Middle East is complicated, Iran can\u2019t be invaded but it also can\u2019t invade anyone else except Iraq (who will probably stay neutral). There would be other huge naval battles between the USA and Iran in the gulf. A lot of oil goes through here, mainly China\u2019s oil. So if the United States cuts off the supply, China will have to rely on Iranian and Russian reserves, a limited supply. Israel would by fighting a 2 front war at least, probably more. They would fare comparatively well and may retake the Suez. Turkey\u2019s choice would weaken whoever they didn\u2019t choose and if that\u2019s NATO we would probably see Syria be surrounded and invaded. This war would have casualties in the millions but would mostly end in a white peace. ",

            "answer_text": "Russia. At present there are wars going on and have been since the Second World war continuously. The main reason seems to be the US drive for control of World Rresources, certainly oil seems an obvious one in that sense. The political power of corporations and finance is so gratified at the prosperity acquired through US political and Military dominance that the process simply accelerates under the impetus of its own success. Eisenhower publicly warned against power falling into the hands of the post WWII phenomenon of the Military Industrial Complex that had been brought into being to win the war but was now held in private hands. Basically he said \u201cGod help us all if they get hold of political power.\u201d Well Dick Cheney was the head of Haliburton and that means the concern has certainly come to pass. War will therefore also be fought because it is directly profitable to these interests which are now in power. The trouble, therefore is that what was supposed to be the beacon of democracy has turned itself upside down to the extent that it destroys any foreign State, whether democracy or not, which stand in the way of its foreign policy and America has become the thing that is frightening, but is poweful enough to stop us thinking that way by demonising its target enemies by way of diversion. Russia and the USSR are simply not the same thing but you wouldn\u2019t know it from US Government rhetoric. The problem remains, though, that when it came to War inVietnam, for instance, though that was a proxy war against theUSSR, they lost and they knew they were going to lose a long time before the retreat happened what is more as we now know from the recently released records. In WWII we forget that 70% of the War was fought by the USSR and it was the victory in Stalingrad that won it, the rest was a violent but inevitable winding down of Germany. The combined might of The British Empire and the US were no match for the Nazis compared to Russia, barely winning 30% between them. The Russians pointedly refer to it as \u201cThe Great Patriotic War\u201d even to this day. I think posterity will show that despite all the propaganda the West and its ambitions have been the main aggressors globally, but in the end they don\u2019t win wars, just profit from them. How are they going to occupy Russia or China for instance, if they couldn\u2019t handle Vietnam despite dropping a greater explosive tonnage of bombs on them that were dropped anywhere throughout WWII including Big Boy and Fat Boy? They have lost in Afghanistan and Syria, but the oil is secure, which must be the point The best thing we can all do is demand that our politicians stop these dreadfully cynical games now before the disasters increase further; because there are plenty of madmen who would prefer to destroy the world than to die while others survive: and the only way for us to do that is by creating what democracy intended to be. A system that does the bidding of the peaceful majority. What we have is a terrible parody of that instead; a system that does the bidding of the violent minority: and it must be rectified for all our sakes. ",
