            "answer_text": "Amid threats, public health officials are leaving their posts Rachel Weiner, Ariana Eunjung Cha - The Washington Post - Monday, June 22, 2020 For Lauri Jones, the trouble began in early May. The director of a small public health department in western Washington State was working with a family under quarantine because of coronavirus exposure. When she heard one family member had been out in the community, Jones decided to check in. The routine phone call launched a nightmare. \u201c Someone posted on social media that we had violated their civil liberties [and] named me by name,\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cThey said, \u2018Let\u2019s post her address .\u2009.\u2009. Let\u2019s start shooting.\u2019 \u201d People from across the country began calling her personal phone with similar threats. \u201c We\u2019ve been doing the same thing in public health on a daily basis forever. But we are now the villains,\u201d said Jones, 64, who called the police and set up surveillance cameras at her home. Public health workers, already underfunded and understaffed, are confronting waves of protest at their homes and offices in addition to pressure from politicians who favor a faster reopening. Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said more than 20 health officials have been fired, resigned or have retired in recent weeks \u201cdue to conditions related to having to enforce and stand up for strong public health tactics during this pandemic.\u201d Although shutdown measures are broadly popular, a vocal minority opposes them vociferously. There have been attacks on officials\u2019 race, gender, sexual orientation and appearance. Freeman said some of the criticisms \u201cseem to be harsher for women.\u201d Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said attacks on health officials have been particularly awful in California, Colorado, Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. This month in California, Nichole Quick, Orange County\u2019s chief health officer, stepped down after she faced threats and protests at her home for requiring face coverings in many businesses as cases rose. The mandate, issued May 23, was softened to a recommendation a week later. Andrew Noymer, a professor of public health at the University of California at Irvine who is part of a county task force, said it was not the first time Quick had been undermined. On March 17, Quick issued a strict lockdown order; a day later it was amended to add exceptions. \u201c It was couched as a clarification, but it was a walk back,\u201d Noymer said, because of pressure from business leaders. Quick\u2019s departure is part of an exodus of public health officials across the country who have been blamed by both citizens and politicians for the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201c I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anybody resign for the kinds of reasons we\u2019ve seen recently,\u201d Plescia said. \u201cWe are very concerned that if it continues to get worse it\u2019s going to have major implications for who will be willing to have these jobs.\u201d Ohio\u2019s public health director, Amy Acton, shifted to an advisory role after enduring months of anger against the state\u2019s preventive measures, including armed protesters at her home bearing messages including anti-Semitic and sexist slurs. One Republican lawmaker linked Acton, who is Jewish, to Nazi Germany; another called her a dictator. Georgia\u2019s public health director said last month that she receives threats daily and now has an armed escort. Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of health, who is transgender, has come under fire for the state\u2019s handling of the pandemic, including from a county official who resigned after saying at a recent meeting that he was \u201ctired of listening to a guy dressed up as a woman.\u201d Four public health officials in Colorado have left their jobs recently. A day after telling political leaders in Weld County, Colo. that their insistence on a speedy reopening despite a high case rate and widespread transmission was giving him \u201cserious heartburn,\u201d Public Health Director Mark Wallace got a 7:30 p.m. email: He had until 9 a.m., it said, to weigh in on guidelines for reopening businesses \u2014 \u201cchurches, salons, restaurants, etc.\u201d They would go public an hour later. Wallace, who declined to comment for this article, retired soon after. Theresa Anselmo, executive director of the Colorado Association of Local Public Health Officials, said 80 percent of members had reported being threatened and more than that were at risk of termination or lost funding. \u201c It\u2019s exhausting to be contradicted and argued with and devalued and demoralized all the time, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing around the country,\u201d Anselmo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen from the top down the federal government is pitting public health against freedom, and to set up that false dichotomy is really a disservice to the men and women who have dedicated their lives .\u2009.\u2009. to helping people.\u201d Not everyone has left willingly. In Colorado\u2019s Rio Grande County, Emily Brown was fired, she says, after advocating a more cautious response to the virus. \u201c I think I just finally pushed too hard,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was resistance to taking steps as quickly as I felt they needed to be taken or move in directions I thought we needed to.\u201d She had been in her position for six years and valued being part of a close-knit rural community. But during the pandemic, she began getting threatening messages online from people she considered neighbors, including one Facebook post that referenced hanging. She became worried about who she might run into at the grocery store. \u201c I\u2019ve been surprised at who professes that vitriol so vocally on platforms like social media,\u201d she said. Derrick Neal, who runs the public health department in Round Rock, Texas, and is past president of the state public health workers\u2019 association, said given the virus\u2019s impact on daily life, public health was inevitably tied up in politics. \u201cBut a community has to be healthy in order to be economically solvent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been lost in the politics of all this.\u201d Public health workers in California have also been battered publicly by business groups, ordinary citizens and elected officials. Several have resigned. \u201c Half a dozen county health leaders are leaving their positions in the coming weeks. All of them have served with distinction and in the interest of public health,\u201d California Medical Association president Peter Bretan Jr. said in a statement. \u201cWe are deeply concerned that politics may be trumping public interest.\u201d After Los Angeles County health official Barbara Ferrer held a news conference on May 13 saying some stay-at-home restrictions may remain in place for three more months, a doctored photo of her with dark circles under her eyes made its way across social media. One tweet, liked or retweeted more than 100,000 times, called her \u201cthe most unhealthy looking person I have ever seen.\u201d In a full-page ad in the local newspaper, a business council accused Santa Clara County\u2019s public health officer, Sara Cody, of \u201ccratering our economy\u201d for being the first in the nation to impose a shelter-in-place order. The local sheriff is now investigating threats against her. People in the field worry that many of these vacant positions will be difficult to fill. \u201c This is the beginning of a wave of people leaving,\u201d Anselmo said. \u201cWho would want to go work as a director in a public health department when you have a target on your back?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Two of the biggest public health concerns at the moment that will only to continue to grow in the foreseeable future are Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and Mental Health. According to the World Health Organization there has been a sharp rise over the past decade in the number of deaths from diseases related to one\u2019s \u201clifestyle\u201d such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and various forms of cancer[1]. Sadly, economically depressed countries in the developing world have been hardest hit as millions attempt to copy a Western style diet and lifestyle. Likewise, metal health issues such as dementia have been steadily on the rise globally[2] . The overall increase in the number of elderly across the globe as people live longer is partly responsible, but it also stems from factors such as the shrinking of extended families, the continued mass migration to cities, and social isolation and stress that comes with these transitions[3] . Unlike tangible conditions such as obesity and cancer, mental health often remains hidden under a veil of secrecy and stigma. These two categories of disease alone pose major financial and social burdens on governments everywhere and will be the major health issues of this century. Footnotes[1] New WHO report: deaths from noncommunicable diseases on the rise, with developing world hit hardest[2] Mental disorders affect one in four people[3] Assessing the economic impact of stress[mdash ]The modern day hidden epidemic",

            "answer_text": "Opiates/prescription painkiller use and abuse is a big US problem - not sure about elsewhere. It\u2019s a problem because although people are abusing them, there are also many chronic pain patients who really need them and cannot get them because of the severe restrictions on them due to fear of addiction, political pressures, and lastly the actual abusers. These pain patients are suffering greatly - and may end up turning to heroin or street drugs in an attempt to get relief, which helps the problem not at all. And once you\u2019re hooked, whether due to a real need or recreational use, getting off both legal and illegal opiates is extremely difficult, overdosing becomes likely and some supposed rehab clinics are suspect these days for \u201crecycling\u201d their patients in an attempt to make more money! The whole situation is a real public health clusterfuck, please excuse my language. ",
