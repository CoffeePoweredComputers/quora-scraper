            "answer_text": "\u201cBasically all\u201d civilizations? No civilization that didn\u2019t arise in the Mediterranean basin considered gold fundamental currency. China, classical India and Persia all used silver, and China didn\u2019t accept gold as money until Europeans forced them to at gunpoint in the 19th century. The Aztecs and Incas had tons of gold and used it for decorative purposes only - Aztecs seem to have used cocoa as the basis for a currency and the Incas appear to have had a surprisingly abstract accounting system that was tied to potato harvests if it was tied to anything concrete at all. Silver was the original basis of Egypt\u2019s trade, shifting only to gold after extensive contact with other Mediterranean civilizations. The Roman Republic used silver, with gold coins formally introduced and standardized by Julius Caesar. Gold is malleable, has a low melting point, and doesn\u2019t tarnish at all, which are useful things for coinage. But not so useful that it became a universal choice. In all likelihood, trade in gold became one accepted norm in the Mediterranean because the Phoenicians liked it, and the Phoenicians did most of the sailing about and trading. Its use by the Roman Empire made all of Rome\u2019s successor states, which is most states today, inclined to use it. But I\u2019m not aware of any state that can\u2019t trace its lineage back to Rome using gold as money; silver has been far more widespread and popular. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s an interesting one. Ancient Egypt\u2019s economy wasn\u2019t based on a gold standard. it was based on grain. Overlords were paid in grain, which they made into bee and bread to feed their slaves. The good thing about this is, it encourages spending, rather than hoarding, so it circulates in the community, rather than being concentrated in a few hands. Yes, there were rich people and poor people, but the poor people were paid in food for their labor. In fact, even skilled workers could be paid in bread, receiving hundreds of loaves, which they would then need to distribute in order to receive value from them, since storing them until they went state would diminish their worth. This meant that wealth circulated more freely in the community. The bad thing, of course, is that grain is subject to predation from rats, mice and insects, so it was difficult to accumulate it over time. They also used a barter system, based on common goods, and before the introduction of standardized coinage, they used a system based on the weights of various precious metals, although silver and copper were more used than gold.
