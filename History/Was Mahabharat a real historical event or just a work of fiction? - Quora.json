            "answer_text": "If there be a word for the most incredible tale ever told \u2013 then it is the story of the Mahabharat. There is a great debate about whether there is any historical accuracy in the story of Mahabharata. This narrative is so remarkable that it has made numerous people speculate - \u2018Did it really happen? Let\u2019s find some answers\u2026 The country is named Bhaarat after the king Bharat (son of Dushyant & Shakuntala). What country would be named after the hero of a novel! Maurya, Gupta and Indo-Greek dynasties, are also recorded in our Puraanas. These dynasties are accepted only because they are also recorded by Greek historians. What about the dynasties that existed before the Greek historians? More than thirty-five sites in North India have yielded archaeological evidence and have been identified as ancient cities described in the Mahabharatha. Copper utensils, iron, seals, gold & silver ornaments, terracotta discs and painted grey ware pottery have all been found in these sites. Scientific dating of these artifacts corresponds to the non-aryan-invasion model of Indian antiquity. All places mentioned in Mahabharata are real places, all are identified as real places. For instance, Hastinapur is in UP. Indraprastha is the present day Delhi. Dwarka is located in Gujarat coast. Moreover, Mahabharata cities are not limited to present day India because Mahabharata referred Indian subcontinent as Bharata. For example, Gandhar could be present day Kandhar. Among the extensive and deep underwater discoveries were the massive Dwarka city wall, a large door socket and a bastion from the fort wall, natural harbour, two rock-cut slipways of different width and sizes extending from the beach to the inter tidal zone and numerous old stone ship anchors were excavated\u2026 European scholars brought the nomadic Aryan tribes, into India after 1500 BC. How could these Aryans create Sanskrit language, gain so much knowledge and write all these texts before 700 BC? Great Indian thinkers including Lokmanya Tilak, Sri Arbindo, and Dyanand Sarasvati rejected the European theory. The Indian Epics, especially the MAHABHARATA, pick up the thread of the tale of devastation and destruction. Sanskrit scholars could not comprehend what was being described in the Epics until the dropping of the first atomic bombs on Japan. The architect of modern atomic bomb who was in charge of the Manhattan project was asked by a student after the Manhattan explosion, \u201cHow do you feel after having exploded the first atomic bomb on earth\u201d. Oppenheimer\u2019s reply for the question was, \u201cnot first atomic bomb, but first atomic bomb in modern times\u201d. He strongly believed that nukes were used in ancient India. ",

That\u2019s how faith works, enough of us beleive it to be history and not just a story. and beyond that, the presence of the underground river right where the story states and several incidents like the solar eclipse etc prove that it either happened or was written with some other true story as a background.
