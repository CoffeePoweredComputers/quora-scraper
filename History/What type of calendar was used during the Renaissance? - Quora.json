            "answer_text": "The Julian calendar was used in Christian Europe. The islamic part of Spain was probably using the Islamic moon based calendar that is still in use for the Islamic Holy month and the islamic celebrations. The people living in what is now Mexico, and the countries south of Mexico used a calendar developed by their mathematicians. I do not know what calendars were used by the people in India, China, Japan, Korea and in other civilisations. Some civilisations do not use calendars. ",
