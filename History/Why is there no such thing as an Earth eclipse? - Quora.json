            "answer_text": "The closest equivalent of a solar eclipse, but with the earth being blocked from view, requires FOUR bodies all in a line (from left to right: the sun for light, the earth to be blocked, a 3rd object to block our view of earth, and then a fourth \u2014 you \u2014 at just the right distance so they all line up perfectly). And the sun, earth, and blocking body all have to have the right relative sizes and distances so that the diameter/(distance-to-you) ratio is the same for each. But there is NO such \u201cblocker body\u201d in space. In the picture below**, you would have to be at the (unseen, farther to the right) tip of the cone showing the earth\u2019s shadow, and the moon would have to be further to the right to where it exactly fits the cone: nearly three times farther from the Earth than it is now, with you being about nearly as far behind the moon as the moon is now from the earth. Alternatively, the equivalent of a lunar eclipse would require some object to pass between the earth and sun, and leave the earth in it\u2019s shadow. But that means the object would have to be larger than the earth \u2014 and there is no such object in the inner solar system, let alone close enough to earth to make this work. ** Note that this picture is NOT realistic, in the sense that it is not even close to being to scale: the diameters are not to scale, nor the distances, nor the ratios between diameter and distance. But the conceptual idea is correct.  ",

            "answer_text": "I vote that there certainly are \u201cEarth eclipses\u201d Let\u2019s look at the other types of eclipses we see: A \u201csolar\u201d eclipse is a shadow falling on the earth due to the moon blocking the sun from earthly observers. A \u201clunar\u201d eclipse is a shadow falling on the moon due to the earth blocking the sun. There are no \u201cobservers\u201d on the moon at the moment to tell us what they call it. Many orbiting satellites have eclipses with every orbit \u2026 the sun disappears behind the mass of the earth. Finally\u2026 there\u2019s the earthly observers\u2019 experience every night \u2026 the sun disappears behind the mass of the earth. For the next number of hours, those observers are in the shadow of the earth! So every night you\u2019re experiencing an earth eclipse. Hold up your hand. See that it\u2019s in the earth\u2019s shadow! My second suggestion is that a \u201clunar eclipse\u201d is really mis-named. The moon is experiencing an \u201cEarth Eclipse\u201d \u2026 with the added feature of a thin ring of red light surrounding the planet as the sun refracts through our atmosphere. ",
