            "answer_text": "Nothing has hurt me yet. I still have a job, my home was not blown over by Hurricane Irma so I have not needed any Federal Support. I am not a former miner or near any industrial or mining environmental disaster waiting to happen, and my drinking water has been ok straight from the Tap. I have not had to use any of my Co-pay or deductables or indeed anything of the $400 or so that I pay monthly for medical insurance with my employer, who kicks in another $800 on top of that for me. I am Caucasian, and non-Hispanic so I have not been harassed by law enforcement of any kind, and no lone wolf crazy gun man or radicalized Islamist has troubled me or anyone close to me so far. No extreme right wing racist speaker has tried to set up a public event on the college campus next to me, and there are no Civil War monuments featuring leaders from the Southern Confederacy states so no Neo - Nazi or KKK marches with the attention of Antifa and both sides spoiling for a fight. What has happened is almost inured now to the chaos that is the Trump Administration, a bad content but high ratings reality reality show, although the main characters have an ability to re-define or create alternate realities and facts as they see fit, even contradicting their own utterances and showing their bigotry. So what was great is becoming a grate of sorts, with poor grammar, spelling, 6th grade language to dumb down facts to the Republican Trump base. Donald Trump Jr. cannot tell the difference between \u2018too\u2019 and \u2018to\u2019 so I guess his daughter would not need it if there is a continuation of the trend of something that looks like incest or at least a bit over the line in father/daughter relationships. His Father continues to invent alternative facts, such as the Healthcare Ads that blame the Democrats for not letting a majority republican house and senate do anything about the Affordable Care act, and whilst rigging the system against success by reducing overall support of the system, blaming others for the impact that raising health insurance premiums are bringing. The divisive hiatus of no adult supervision in Government hopefully will not last more than another 3 years, and a truly integrative and non-divisive era will follow to repair the chaos and anarchy that it seems was the plan by Russia all along, to reduce the status of the USA globally. Thank you for the A2A, Sam. ",

            "answer_text": "What\u2019s changed in my world (living in CA): Due to Trump\u2019s tax changes we cap out and can no longer deduct our house property tax ($8000/yr) so our tax returns went from getting a refund of $1800 under Obama to owing $6400 under Trump.Cost of food is skyrocketing, we (two of us) used to budget $120/week for groceries, that no longer gets us sufficient food for the week, we\u2019ve had to increase that budget to $180/week. This is a direct result of Trump\u2019s tariffs and excessive crack down on illegals.Politics under Trump seems to be above the law, there is no accountability, unqualified people are being placed into government positions simply because they are Trump friendly. Political corruption has increased significantly. Public schools are now worse than they were before as Trump has cut funding even more, so if your a parent that wants to get your kid a good education, you\u2019ll have to invest heavily in private schooling which increase most US citizen expenses to $1500/mo just to get their kid educated thru High School, not even started on college funding yet.Trade concerns and the massive increase in the deficit has my retirement investments all over the place with huge fluctuations making me extremely nervous. After Trumps 21% tax cut for corporations and the 1% richest people in and out of America, the stock market got a bump to about 25000 and is now stuck fluctuating between 23000 - 26000 and hasn\u2019t seen any stable positive trend/growth. So much for the so called corporate world \u201cre-investing\u201d in America, they just took the tax cut money and built more factories in Asia.Trump is now targeting Social Security as the next program to cut \u2026 what\u2019s going to happen to the all the money I\u2019ve paid into Soc Sec over the past 35 years, will it be there when I need it? I\u2019ve paid A LOT of money into Soc Sec. Trump has just added more stress to my world.These are the REAL affects of Trump\u2019s changes on our lives. ",

            "answer_text": "The USA has changed less than you\u2019d think since Donald Trump\u2019s election. The sun still rises and sets. People still sleep, eat, work, and learn. The roads still roll, the power still runs, and the cold water is still cold. As for how it\u2019s changed? Well, the economy has kept humming along, still generally on or a little below Obama\u2019s trendline. Trump is disrupting this\u2014but I\u2019ll get back to that. Socially it\u2019s mixed. Racism and homophobia are more overt again, but the backlash against sexism a la Trump is finally bringing more shreds of social equality to women. Institutionally we\u2019re in trouble. The GOP has been trash-talking government for decades, and right now too many Republicans are willing to undermine too many long-standing pillars of society, from law enforcement to the courts to our independent press to many portions of the Constitution. Internationally we\u2019re in trouble too. Trump has made our word next to worthless, what with pulling out of treaties and accords for either bad reasons or trumped-up reasons. He scorns and undercuts diplomacy while worshiping the cult of war\u2014war for other people to fight, not him and his family. When the US withdraws, it does not lead. We are rapidly abandoning our leadership role globally, and our still-new trade war is leading to other countries cutting us out of the commerce equation. That means shocks for our economy. Right now the primary hope for the country is a solid repudiation of Trump. We need to rebuke his mean-spiritedness, his divisiveness, and his incompetence. We need to expose, debunk and reverse his demagogic, anti-populist, anti-Christian, anti-Constitutional platform that\u2019s wrapped up in a cloak of flag-hugging, Christianist, propagandist gaslights. I wish I could say that I\u2019m hopeful. ",

            "answer_text": "It hasn\u2019t changed, just more stuff is out there in the open. Context: The last 10 years have been very volatile in the U.S.There have been multiple movements aimed at shaking things up since the financial crisis:The Tea Party MovementOccupy Wall Street MovementThe Intersectionality Movement (or Modern PC Movement)Trumpism (Populism)The ResistanceThe Progressive Movement (Bernie Bros)Alt-Right MovementThese movements have all been a product of changes in the United States, ranging from economic to political issues that haven\u2019t really been addressed by the 2 parties.On the right, Trumpism was a product of the failure of the Tea Party movement to a. get rid of Obamacare and b. force Obama out of office during the 2012 election. The base thought Republicans weren\u2019t fighting the Dems hard enough on issues, and started referring to weak Republicans as \u201ccuckservatives.\u201d Trump came about due to the strong demand for an unprincipled brawler, who could offer what the Tea Party failed to offer and more.4 out of the 5 movements on the left are still active. All somewhat represent the total triumph of the New Left coalition from the 1970\u2019s over the Labor/Socialist/Welfarism segment of the Left going all the way back to the 1930\u2019s, who ultimately achieved nothing during the OWS Movement. The politics of the left is increasingly focused on identity issues.The Alt-Right Movement, differs somewhat from Trumpism and is already on the decline, but as a movement, it is still important. It\u2019s really the first movement on the right to see some sort of usefulness of identity politics. It\u2019s dying mostly because identity politics, by its nature doesn\u2019t unite, but rather balkanizes people.The Intersectionality Movement is in competition with the Resistance for attempting to unite the left or better yet to develop somekind of structure around identity politics. The Intersectionality movement is trying to provide a hierarchical structure for the Left so that it can prioritize the needs of it\u2019s diverse base (the more oppressed you are, the more your political needs matter and should be prioritized.) The Resistance is more a left-wing version of the Tea Party that is aimed at getting rid of Trump, but doesn\u2019t really have anything to offer besides that.Lastly, the New Progressive Movement, is a product of the Dems realization after watching Trump, that the country is a lot more open to government intervention in the economy (despite the failure of this branch of the left to get anything done during OWS). It\u2019s also a product of the realization that millennials are much more open to some socialism since they are convinced that they will not have the same quality of life as their parents.In other words, both parties are still trying to deal with the crash of 2008 and it\u2019s cultural impact that led to an increasing frustration with the institutions of the U.S. Trumpism has managed to distract his base and the GOP from this, by going all out on the Culture war and fights over Tariffs, whereas the Democrats are still trying to figure out how to manage all the diverse interest groups that make up their coalition, and how to deal with the conflicts of interest. Their division is what enabled Trump to win the last election. ",

            "answer_text": "All the corruption in politics and government has come more to the surface. Finally the Deep State monster was partially exposed. Livelyhood-politicians are seen for what they are - corrupt money- & power-grabbing narcissists. Its no longer business as usual - at the expense of the producers. Trump is clearly not from the swamp. The MSMs strong inclination towards socialism & a dishonest reporting has become clear. Fake Media is at its peak, long after Pulitzer inspired all journalists to sell paper based on Fake News. The cultural differences between the conservatives and regressive, marxist left has become clearer. Especially in matters like the border, university leftist politics, leftist discrimination and hate towards anyone disagreeing, an open border policy, total disregard for US citizens(letting illegal aliens go free after rape, rather then giving them to ICE for deportation, etc), etc. The most scary thing for me is who will come after Trump in 2024 and will there still be an american, open democracy, after the left has done all it can to tear it down, show total disregard for the american peoples vote? Our culture is coming apart in the seems, because we never killed off socialism after the war, like we did nazism. Today its cool to be a socialist again, but for some reason its not as cool to be a nazi, even if the two are twins. We should have joined Hitler in destroying marxism first and THEN killed off nazism - both would be gone forever. Trump still has 5 more years, and in those years Europe will crash under all the socialist promises not fulfilled, so atleast americans will have more knowledge about socialism and how destructive it always was and still is, before they go to the ballots in 2024. That is my hope for the american democracy. It looks like the democratic party will be divided before 2024 and its a great thing they fall apart. We can say that Trump divided it and therefore won 2020 and conquered the democracy for the people. Then its up to the people again. PS: Joe Bidens corruption with his son and the spin from the left goes to show that even if the left turns reality upside down, people will still believe. For me it means only one thing. People are sort of brainwashed and will believe what ever they believe, just like a religious person. People obviously needs to believe in something far away from reality to be happy in their everyday life. Good luck, America! ",

            "answer_text": "Trump\u2019s importance can be overstated. I have plenty of friends, very educated friends, stateside who really don\u2019t pay much attention to him. I have to make sure that I don\u2019t raise him in my conversations with them, for fear of coming across as a bore or a crank! They seem to have (or \u201cseem to have had\u201d - I haven\u2019t spoken to them since before the Shutdown, just humorous exchanges on a WhatsApp thread) a general perception that he is not good for America but really only talk about it when something big breaks the headlines - (Putin, Trump & Helsinki) did that for them. You have to remember that 50% of the States don\u2019t bother to vote. I am sure that at least most of my friends do - but I guess they work off general principles, rather than personalities. I think the impact he is having now is the drama of a reality TV show. If, like me (sadly and much to my own bemusement), you are the kind of person that will race home to make sure you don\u2019t miss an episode and perhaps set your recorder just in case you run late or something else happens to make you miss a bit - or you just want to rewatch! - then Trump will feel to you as if deep changes to the fabric of American and global life are being made. In practice, the wrinkles - and some deep creases and the odd tear - that Trump has made in the Constitution will begin being ironed out from January 21st 2021 and by November 2025 there will still be stuff to do and some echoes to damp down, but generally Trump\u2019s significance will have been reduced to a road bump and that will wear down further over time as well. He is just not an able enough politician to make lasting changes to America. He is all personality and no substance. There is of course an \u2018unknown\u2019: Will GOP continue chasing the Alt-Right for votes? If so, the lasting legacy of 2016 - 2020 may be the radicalisation of GOP and the fracturing of the 250-year GOP/Dem binary Constitution. If that happens - the US Government will move more central in terms of politics (a little closer to western Europeans - bear in mind that the majority of Americans who vote, vote Dem and that the majority is urban) and the current form of right-wing politician will be out of power for a very long time to come. ALTERNATIVELY - America moves even further right until the current Alt-right becomes a US version of ISIS! DISCUSS! ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of liberal vehemence. Who knew the kind, inclusive party was so hate-filled? That was quite revealing to me. Democrats expend all their energies trying to make the conservative government fail, without all sorts of elaborate hoaxes and propaganda lies to require power. I\u2019m extremely grateful people who would rather destroy the nation than lose power; aren\u2019t in power. The corruption in the deep state was far worse than anyone suspected, and that\u2019s gotten cleaned up to a degree, a definite positive result. Lots of very positive common sense policies that focus on results rather concepts that sound good, but don\u2019t work. Democrats are still raging over farmers being able to plant where water puddles form in the winter, and stock ponds being treated for invasive plants and bacteria to make it safe for cows to drink. Odd.. And very upset that coal plants are allowed to install pollution control equipment. They wanted them shut down, but failed to wave the magic wand to conjure new plants to replace them. Sort of a glaring oversight. I had no idea these otherwise intelligent people were brain washed into blatant irrationality. Bizarre, really. Great progress on drug pricing with companies like GoodRx. Hospitals forced to publish pricing for the first time. Only a first step, but rationalizing hospital pricing could save a ton of money in paperwork and efficiency. If you can charge a lot, you can hire a ton of administrators, and pretty soon it\u2019s breathtakingly expensive and an only a fraction goes into treatment. Trump will solve that in 4 more years if Democrats can find enough of their souls to want good things, just for a few minutes here and there. The absurdity of the race scam has been revealed. They plan to eliminate racism by making everything about race. Can you get any more absurd? It\u2019s like raping to achieve virginity. People who claim to be race blind thing of nothing else. You wouldn\u2019t humans had any other qualities than skin tone to listen to them. Great tax reform. Local companies that provide jobs are taxed at the world norm, while overseas companies that provide no jobs and pay no tax pay tariff taxes. The logic is quite compelling. Works too. The mad rush to China has slowed to a trickle. Ordinary folk no longer had to pay local taxes for the rich. That cost me a bit, but I\u2019m Ok with it because it\u2019s the right thing to do. ",

            "answer_text": "A Party Gone Mad \u2013 Today\u2019s Republicans are Yesterday\u2019s Fascists by Hrafnkell Haraldsson Growing up, I always wondered how an entire nation could go mad. I was thinking about Nazi Germany, and millions of good, decent Germans, seeming to lose their minds for Hitler and National Socialism and its repressive brutality.es not understand the character of the nation, its history or its aspirations. But in the USA we can also suffer xenophobia and see thing the world in a dim and confused light blaming all sorts of things that don\u2019t really exist. Then along comes Trump to prove my point. He exhilarates the negative with a fourth rate mind and fifth rate disposition and the worst temperament for the job ever. He has an intense need to be loved and will attack anyone who doesn't or criticizes him. He is a completely deplorable ignorant miserable character. Yet he got elected by a base of angry and fearful negative thinking Americans who like his rants and tweets and can't think critically. They are his base of angry white evangelicals with axes to grind and they are angry their agenda or hurts are not being addressed. And they represent about 26% - 33% of the USA population and they love him. Hell, 81% of the evangelicals voted for him and to them he is still a saint. Since the American right wing now has the emotional temperament of a spoiled three year old with crabs, they've decided that if they can't have all the toys, they'll take a hammer to everything instead. But let's be clear, this goes beyond tribalism. Trump's support is more than \"I support Republicans.\" Trump is not really a Republican. He's not even really a conservative. He represent people with tons of xenophobia who are white Nationalists. If he could raise taxes on the rich (but not himself), he'd do it in a heartbeat. He doesn't care about banning abortion or ending LGBT rights other than inflicting pain on his liberal social values and globalist enemies. ",

What I see is a change in attitudes as Trump's lying and propaganda has become so pervasive that it seems to glide over the media and the citizens. I have conscious memories of every president since JFK and could not imagine any of them getting away before congress or the senate with what is a daily occurence with Trump. I remember Nixon and Clinton getting caught out and facing impeachment but this were more about single issue events. If Bill Clinton's consensual sex with an intern became such a big deal, he is a choirboy compared to Trump. And I am only talking about lying and not past sexual pecadilos! I also cannot understand how the Christian right can embrace a man like Trump who appears to have no morals and is proud enough of thiss to boast about it. He certainly doesn't exhibit any overt signs of being a believer unless I have missed something and golf is an acceptable form of worship. So I think the Trump presidency has had a profound negative influence on American society, from which any recovery will be generational. ",

They didn\u2019t seem to be much of a national menace nor did they command constant media attention. As such, most of us knew about them but didn\u2019t consider their various groups to be major threats. But then, starting in 2015, mostly at Trump rallies, the haters in our society slithered out of the shadows and became well known through the antics and endorsements of one Donald John Trump. Then, other shabby persons suddenly appeared and gained some degree of prominence, again through the shameless belittling of minorities and the disabled. Feigning a belief in Christian values and telling his shouting and boisterous supporters that he would end abortion, a substantial number of Christian evangelical cast aside their principles and joined the Trump bandwagon. In effect, Trump exposed some of the vilest members of the American society and gave then the cover they had longed for. Now, somewhere around 30% to 40% of Americans agree with this despicable, hateful, and loathsome person. While there are some decent and occasionally honorable people who adhere to the Republican Party and its platform, most are anything but that. They typically fit into one of three categories: Haters - Racists, bigots, anti government extremists, neo-nazis, white supremacists.Hypocrites - The greediest among us - ",

We are divided as a nation, the police is bad, ICE is bad, the Border patrol is bad, the Left has become intolerant of other people's views because they can't accept the election results, they're talking about Socialism, want to take our guns, attacking anyone who doesn't agree with them, men and women want to be each other, transgender men are competing in women's sports and beating them, they want open borders, they want free healthcare for illegal immigrants, some states has sanctuary cities, California is a sess pool, New York is falling apart because the mayor hates cops, and many stuff to mention. Yes America has changed under President Trump but unfortunately its because of the unamerican Left who hate him so much that they are praising the ISIS leader as a scholar and Jamie Lee Curtis said he suffered. Isn't this guy responsible for thousands of deaths. That's sad and pathetic. ",

With Trump, patriotism is defined as strict allegiance to an incoherent perception. You can\u2019t win, and even if you do win his approval momentarily, tomorrow presents its own perils. George Bush redefined the legal boundaries of the presidency, and exploited them. Trump continues to exploit and expand them, just look at how he is re-shaping the Supreme Court. The horrors of conservatism don\u2019t end with Gorsuch. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sides with the expansion of executive power as well. ",

            "answer_text": "The USA has developed a policy of \u2018America first\u2019, which implies selfishness and a nation no longer interested in being a world provider, leader, or peacemaker. It is no longer interested in preserving the environment or rendering aid to others. The stories coming from the USA are truly terrifying, and implies a desire from a Republic to Facism. The signs have indeed already started-calling free press the enemy, no interest in preserving the security of elections, and locking up children in cages, of course. Despite Trump\u2019s intentions, this was likely one media disaster which he probably wanted to avoid. Individual cities are losing millions in tourism because America is no longer \u2018the land of the free\u2019, but the land where homeland security will want to check your papers and every goddam thing you wrote on the internet prior to entry. Everyone\u2019s too terrified of the US to try and book a vacation. I live in Canada, and Trump calls us a \u2018National Threat\u2019. Think I\u2019m going to visit there? Nooope. From an outsider\u2019s international point of view, his allies view as a joke at best and dangerous at worst. His real estate worked on a practice of bullying his competition by saying he wants to do things HIS WAY and if anyone disagrees he will sue them into defeat. Unfortunately, his NATO allies have plenty of money and aren\u2019t intimidated in the slightest. So when he says he wants to do things his way and tries to bully another nation with trade tarrifs, it only ends up wrecking both economies. This will likely impact the US more when other nations decide to simply trade between themselves and cut out the US entirely. This was all done in some attempt for the poor and middle class of America to earn more money. But whatever small \u2018bonus\u2019 they received from the tax law will be small and insignificant compared to the economic disaster about to hit them from the tarrifs alone. Let\u2019s see, what else? The LGBTQ crowd now has more to fear as for all of Trump\u2019s promises to support them he is instead opening the door to discriminate against them with Sessions\u2019 \u2018religious hit squad\u2019. Trump has lowered all sorts of regulations for food and safety which somehow he tries to pass off as a good thing. All I can say is be careful what you put in your mouth going forward. The education system is currently run by a woman who has her own yacht, values private education over public, and whose family earned money locking up kids. Abortion rights have taken a hit, and racism is on the rise. Really, the only reason why things seem kind of normalish for some is because there are centuries of laws that prevent Trump from causing a lot of short-term damage. But long term? I suppose that really depends on what America wants to be in the future. Does it want to try and be it\u2019s own silo, disconnected from the world and only caring about itself? Or does it want to be connected to the world again, with ideals that do not include racism and discrimination? ",

That said, I think Mr. Trump is a fish almost out of water. I suggest he needs some brilliant economic advice from genius level people to get us out of this. He needs to ask the right questions and he needs to act on that advice before this comes to a head and we all suffer. After you ask the right questions shut up and listen very carefully. Then if you are confused ask questions to clarify what has been said. The policies and laws he has set up will probably cause the biggest stock market crash in modern history. This is not just me talking. David Stockman is predicting this based on facts not fantasy. I respect Mr. Stockman\u2019s views. To be fair, I think this has come about over the last 10 or so years. It is a no win situation and no matter who is in charge without expert help they are going to fall into a trap that effects all of us. In other words he needs to shut up and ask the right questions from people that are masters of their professions. The trap is to think you know it all. No one person knows it all. Then he needs to follow the recommendations given him. Mr. Trump does go with it is my way or the highway. That will hurt him. ",

Politicians traditionally try not to offend minority groups. If they are bigoted, as Nixon was, they don\u2019t express it in public. Trump openly expresses his bigotry and racism and encourages his followers to do the same. Mosques have been burned and Jewish cemeteries desecrated. There is even a Republican running for Senate in California who seeks to expel all Jews from this country. In over six decades of observing the American political scene I have never seen anything like this! In terms of the decline of the American middle class and the increasingly unbalanced distribution of wealth, America has been in a downward trajectory for a long time. Donald Trump\u2019s policies are exacerbating this slide. Tax cuts for the wealthy, abolishing regulations that restrain bankers and real estate brokers from cheating their customers, abolishing regulations that protect our air, water and food supply, abolishing subsidies for health insurance and cutting medicaid and food stamps all make life a more difficult struggle for Americans. It is ironic that many of the people who will suffer the most are Donald Trump\u2019s biggest fans. I have never seen this country so utterly and bitterly divided. ",

The States are democracies and run by the We the People [1] who elect Representatives and Senators to go to Washington DC and speak for their interests. Amendment X[2] The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Trump has little if any power in any State, just ask California or Washington. He can\u2019t do anything unless the Constitution allows it and that is very limited. The Federals handle external affairs, provide a defense, and make sure things are smooth between the States under the overarching US Constitution. There is always a feeding frenzy going on about Trump doing this, saying that, or what ever scares the hell out of, or outrages, the MSM\u2019s audience.[3] Why not? It is their job to make as much money as possible and fear, terror, and drama sell; especially in the 127 cities that hold about 1/4 of the population.[4]  The politics of those cities are noted below in the election of 2016 map.[5]   The MSM has created a perception that the culture of the 1/4 in the brown spots (urban, their supporting suburbs, and universities/colleges) represents the other 3/4, which it doesn\u2019t) The cultures and views of the others are varied and hardly in lock step. Trump was elected by the States[6]and not directly. About 61.4%[7] the people eligible voted, so the myth of overwhelming support for Trumps adversary is put to rest)  Perhaps there is no change going on other than there are other voices being heard. Trump is just someone the States hired as President. He provided a plan with objectives. He seems to be accomplishing those objectives. That is a fairly amazing performance for a President, who are usually long on promises and short on delivery. He isn\u2019t changing the dream, he is simply doing what he was hired to do. To put the US sovereignty and interests first, work fairly with US allies, and trade on a level playing field. Some people seem to find his style irritating and he offends their sense of aesthetics. They mourn a loss of world status and leadership that was never there. The world has never cared for, or supported US interests. They are imbued with a rational self interest and that is all there is. If the US supports them, they make nice, if not they object. Now that the US wants them to pay their way, they object. This is not objectionable to those that hired him. Those that seem to think that US allies and such are leaving the country that controls 25% of the world\u2019s GDP (China is in 2nd place at 15%) are mistaken. The country grows and that is all there really is to that. Ciao.

Some control is finally being brought to the southern border. Our military strength is slowly improving after Obama tried to destroy it \u201cto level the playing field,\u201d with all other countries. The fine for not enrolling into Obama \u201cCare\" was cancelled. Trade policies which favored foreign countries have, and are being re-negoated, i.e. we were charging a 5% tariff on Chinese products. The Chinese were charging 25% to 40% tariffs on American product. Obama was okay with that, Trump isn't. Our standing in the world has improved now that Trump is President because Obama had been thought to be untrustworthy. This was demonstrated when Obama visited China. There were a few Chinese dignitaries waiting to meet him as he deplaned out of the bottom door of Air Force One. No special event given Obama. When Trimp visited China. He literally got the red carpet treatment with a military honor guard and military band. In our country the unemployment rate is at a 49 year low. Blacks and Hispanic employment is at a historical high. The GNP is twice as high than under Obama, and so is the Stock Market. Companies which Obama claimed would never returned have returned. Obama once said, \u201cWhat's he (Trump) going to do, wave a magic wand? Those companies will never return. You'll have to accept that.\u201d Trump's magic wand are his logical business policies which Obama lacked. So yes, things have changed for the better since Trump was elected, but don't expect the lies and smear against Trump to end. That's all the democrats and the left wing \u201cnews\" media have as they attempt to remove him from office. The democrats have done nothing to benefit this country, so to maintain political power all they can do is obstruct, smear, and lie about Trump. ",

            "answer_text": "The USA as a people and a constitutional government have not changed, the political spectrum, decorum and media fractionalization has. A populist was elected, defeating multiple viable candidates in his own party (a field that frankly did not have a candidate that could overcome populism) and then having an opponent so disdained by the populace, they were left with little choice and he won. He reflects the populace in this \u201cmedia now\u201d world. When I say \u201cmedia now\u201d, I mean putting news out in order to get ratings rather than being factual. The fractionalized media is not objective. National media outlets rarely report the news but spin it toward their audience in order to maintain viewership, it\u2019s a matter of viewership and advertising revenue regardless of harm. To maintain their market, they become divisive and it is reflected in social media. People repeat what they\u2019ve heard in their media of choice. He also reflects the decorum of the \u201chide behind the firewall\u201d and hurl insults crowd. So do many of our elected officials now, it is disturbing and childish. It is demonstrated daily in comment columns under news and sports stories for all to see under some pseudonym to hide the true identity. I would challenge any presidential candidate to promise to stay off of social media if elected\u2026wow, wouldn\u2019t that be refreshing? A word of advice to Democrats, a Progressive Socialist leaning candidate will go down to defeat. Give the country what it needs now, a strong leader, nominate someone who can unite the centrists and become a wiser alternative. Provide a fiscally sound platform, fix immigration and provide for a fair tax system that encourages economic prosperity. Get us out of the Middle East quagmire. A Bloomberg or somebody like him would be a good start. Biden may also be a viable candidate, but personally, I think Bloomberg would be a better fit as a leader and for reaching those independents, libertarians and embarrassed Republicans who know we can do better as a country. To my Democrat friends, help us help you! ",

He is finally enforcing some of the Immigration laws that have been in effect for YEARS, but no other President has enforced.

Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats stated, mere MINUTES after being sworn in, that their ONLY goal is to impeach him. They aren't even TRYING to work with him. If they spent even HALF the time on actual ISSUES, that they spend trying to discredit him, maybe America would be even better. ",

Unemployment has dropped to the lowest levels since the 1960s, while wages increased by 3.1 percent, a decade\u2019s record. There are about a million more job openings than there are people who are considered unemployed. For more clarity of the topic watch my video  The economy grew at an annual pace of 3.5 percent in the third quarter, after the blockbuster 4.2 percent in the second quarter. Only twice since 2006 has the gross domestic product increased faster over half a year. The optimistic record is stained somewhat by a dramatic slump in the stock market at the end of the year, which Trump blamed on the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates too fast. ",

Lowering the capital gains tax on businesses corporations enabling them to bring billions of money overseas back to America for reinvestment in our country. Lowering taxes for 90% of America. Creating 5.2 trillion dollars worth of wealth by removing the over regulation, and over taxation of the Obama era, which has led to the lowest unemployment rate for women in 18 years, and the lowest unemployment rate EVER for blacks. Allowing the generals to fight ISIS without micro managing them, which has led to the decimation of them He has shook up the status quo in currupt Washington, and is moving the government back to the people by transparency. Removing us from the Paris agreement, which did nothing for climate change, but rather was a grab of Americans hard earned money through higher utilitybills, which is the ultimate poor man's tax. Addressing the UNs misuse of our money, and, enforcing countries to pay their fair share, rather then overburdening America, and thus the tax payer. Has done a great deal of work towards making us energy independent. Addressing a armed and nuclear N. Korea, that the last 3 presidents chose to ignore. (Which is why we have a nuclear Korea) Addressing the many faults of the Iranian deal, so we don't end up with a nuclear Iran, also. Addressing the open Southern border, so we can control drug traffickers, snd illegal immigration into our country ONCE AND FOR ALL. Handing the illegal DACA agreement, created by Obama, back to congress to be resolved, which is where it should of been all along. Is working rowards fixing our broken education system, rather then just throwimg more federal dollars at it, and working towards putting control back in the hands of parents. Working with communities across America with the Opied crisis. Restoring hope, pride, and relief for millions of Americans, of all races, and gender, through a improved economic climate (65% of Americans believe our economy is excellent) Our president has accomplished all of this for America, despite the 98% of negative reporting, including the misrepresentation of being called a racist, a bigot, collusion with Russia\u2026 There's A lot of facts here.

Loss of relationships with all democratic allies in the world (client states don\u2019t count).

Our countries reputation has changed from world leadership to world pariah, shamed and disgraced before all of the world. We have become an enemy of world peace and a laughing stock of anti civilized behavior. Lies have become truths to millions of Americans. Honesty, compassion, Christian style values (whether or not religious) and civility have died in our country. The American distortion of Christianity has become the opposite of what the New Testament taught. Our education system, infrastructure and health care system is deteriorating even while a bloated, imperial military continues to steal the money needed for far more important things. Positive changes; Due to the promises kept on lower taxes and less regulation, the largest stock rally in our lifetime has occurred. Perhaps for the wrong reasons, but as an avid investor, I admit I didn\u2019t turn the money down.

            "answer_text": "Morgan, I should think that the Trump policies, while controversial in tone, are directing our county to address matters long ignored. Economically, the country is experiencing a turn around as I am sure you can see from growth figures published today. Most Americans see economic improvement in their daily living now freer that it was before. Mechanisms driving growth are sound and sustainable. This supply side growth is the only approach I know of if the country is to avoid national bankruptcy through deficient spending. (Maybe you know of someone who otherwise knows or even understands how to address the 20 trillion deficit and unfunded future entitlements. Truly, I don\u2019t.) Immigration, long ignored, is now at the forefront of policy making and enforcement; it is subject to redefinition to fit the country in need of a labor force suited to this new technological age. The answer will not be based in sentiment; it will be painful. American foreign policy is now addressing and restructuring a global system in need of many fixes. Those on the job know what they are doing and why they are doing it. And, it is working. Culturally, we are in the midst of a great divide. The country is in need of prayer and common sense to restore egalitarian government. The country is finding itself, a good thing if we do not lose sight of what America was conceived to be, but if we loose our moorings I doubt this country will long endure. ",

Anything significant happened in November and December, when he finally did ONE piece of legislation: the Tax Reform. I am looking at my taxes changing effectively nothing this year and the next. But, I am going to start paying for it later thanks to how the system is set up. With the individual mandate for the ACA repealed, my brother\u2019s health insurance goes up. It also doesn\u2019t help that the FCC blatently went against the people it was supposed to protect and voted in favor of the ISPs, so I am probably going to see my internet getting more expensive for the same shit I get. So, basically, a whole lot of nothing but some idiot in the Oval Office just talking shit for the most of the year, and then managed to fuck us over before Christmas. Thanks Trump. ",

I am not a Trump fan, but I would have to say he is doing exactly what he said he would do when he was running for President. He promised to roll back the Obama era rules and regulations that were largely done by Executive Order. His mistake, of course is that by using this method, he too might see his EO\u2019s reversed by the next President. I believe his foreign policy people are capable and sober minded individuals that understand America\u2019s place in the world. That team will buffer Trump\u2019s knee jerk approach to policy decisions, which is not to say Trump won\u2019t continue tweeting, but for \u201cknowing\u201d people those tweets will be largely ignored. Only the media seem to think it important on an hourly basis and keep the most lame tweets alive long past their expiration dates. Finally, no matter what happens under the Trump watch, America will survive. Of that I am certain. ",

What will happen is the left will be focusing on who to anoint as the person they want to beat Trump in 2020 and the Mueller Probe will die a quiet death now that they got their face saving convictions of some low hanging fruit.

Things that people have been saying and thinking for decades are now said out loud because Trump has no filter and suddenly people are shocked. WTF. Hes now told foreign countries what they can do with their international treaties, trade agreements etc. 11 countries signed up to TPP and are working without the US. I read that Trump is working to get back into it and try to negotiate Americas participation. Most will now tell Trump to take a hike. Long term America will be FAR worse off when they realise how much they are disadvantaged by not working with other countries and treating people with respect and dignity. ",

The underlying economic reality of deficit spending, skyrocketing health care costs, an education system that produces students with skills that don\u2019t match those required by business hasn\u2019t changed. The US military is still involved abroad, although with looser rules of engagement. US relaxes rules of engagement to help troops in Afghanistan defeat Taliban Illegal immigrants still arrive and some get deported, although fewer than under the Obama administration. U.S. deportations down in 2017 but immigration arrests up What has changed is the Left no longer controls the White House. Since the Left does control the mainstream media for the most part, its whining has been amplified. The Right similarly whined during the Obama administration, but since it wasn\u2019t amplified through Left-wing media outlets, there was less noise from the masses during that administration than the current. But the basic policies of America haven\u2019t changed nor are they likely to thanks to the division of power built into its government institutions. ",

Trump lit a fire under NATO and got the other countries to grow up. The new trade deal with Europe is much better than what we had. Mexico seems ready to deal more even too. The US led the world in reduction of CO2 last year without the government interference of the Paris mess. Yes the rich are still getting much richer but now the rest have a chance too. And finally we have a president making progress with North Korea. Obama would not even do the traditional meeting with Russia. He sent Hillary and she botched it so big. ",

You could see this in the 80s with the Reagan Revolution, the 90s with New Gingrich\u2019s Contract with America, the 0ties with the Blue Wave in 06 and Obama\u2019s election, and the Tea Party wave in 2010 and 2014. Generally, parties can only have two consecutive terms in power, with the only example otherwise since Roosevelt is Reagan and Bushes 12 years. Mix these factors with a global climate favoring the far right and the push to the right by TEA Party types and White Nationalists, and you mix up the perfect cocktail for getting someone like Cruz, Trump, and Carson winning. Although his sexual assaults and general stupidity almost cost him the election, she was unable to draw support in the upper Midwest due to the faulty polling and lack of polling in the area leading her to assume she had it in the bag, and her instead working on building infrastructure for future campaigns in Arizona and Georgia, which she had little chance of winning without a landslide.

But the the republican party has been taken over by the tea party people who are in fact racist, bigots, and so on. In fact 72% of the domestic terrorism is done by the extreme right and less than 3% on the left despite the right\u2019s constant propaganda. In the USa the republicans have managed to gerrymander, prevent voting, and many other things to maintain power. In fact they refuse to impeach Trump despite the clear evidence that he has literally broken the law multiple times. You have to look though at the core root of all this evil. Money. The corporations and people who have lots of money literally buy our government, democrat and republican. this is why Sanders and Warren are so popular now. People are tired of it and not being represented. Honestly, this is the republicans \u201clast gasp\u201d and the racists and bigots with them. In the mid term their popularity dropped and they lost the house. They will continue to lose the presidency and the senate if they do not change their attitude. Keep in mind Trump only won by like 78,000 votes in key states. The people he promised they would have jobs, now are sadly losing their jobs, coal, GM just closed a plant, soy bean farmers have rotting crops they can not sell, etc\u2026 Under the current administration, yeah the US is giving everyone a big \u201cFuck You\u201d, but the majority of the people are not that way. I would say we just had a run of bad luck in the USA. Wait for another year. things will get better. ",

As has been said many times, he is a symptom more than a disease. These white supremacists, nationalists, sexists and economic gamblers have always been part of the US society. Before Trump it was the so- called Tea Party movement that paved the way. The biggest change DT has brought about is that these horrible, simplistic people have lost the shame of coming out and letting everyone share their bullshit. Because he shows them it can be done, also having no shame at all for letting everyone know what kind of a..hole he is. He has brought to the light of day the horrors that have always been buried in the US society. Truly the symptom, not the plague. ",

Under Trump, we became stronger in the world, however, the divisions that were exasperated by Obama, were opened even further. In short, every president changes us. We can chose if we like the change or not. Which means every election is a referendum. Which means, the referendums that occurred in 1980, 1994, 2000, 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2016, were clear indications of desires to change the previous paths we were on!

BTW, I am not blaming any one person or political party. I think the extremists from both sides are helping to create this environment. ",

We will soon be at starvation levels. In the old Soviet Union the government controlled the people by limiting the amount of food in supply, while the elites wined and dined in luxury. ",

People who hate have been given permission to attack , either verbally or physically. Ugliness has replaced civility. Being civil is not political correct. Even the word civilization contains \u201ccivility.\u201d A nation cannot prosper when hatred runs amok; it cannot grow, it cannot prosper. Consider the black firefighter doing his job yet a homeowner calls police because of his color. Or the woman resting after hours of study in a well respected university who has to explain to police why she is in a common area of her dorm. A white woman felt a black woman wasn\u2019t capable of being a student. Or another student who was working with a professor who was eating her lunch but a white student objected to her being on campus. America is at risk of losing all civility, allowing people to behave like animals. (My apologies to all animals for that.) ",

And while our economy may appear great, it is built on deficit spending and could collapse on a moment's notice. The only group that has really benefitted by Trump being in office is the top 1%. But the country is so ignorant and uneducated that they don't realize any of this. Trump is flushing the USA down the toilet. ",
