            "answer_text": "Gladiators were always slaves at some point but if a gladiator could earn enough favor with the crowds and become a champion, he could be granted his freedom and citizenship by imperial decree. As far as gladiators being saved by crowds, there's a pretty good chance it didnt happen very often. The purpose of the Roman games were to enjoy the slaughter and bloodshed. It would take a gladiator with lots and lots of favorable fights and crowd-pleasing antics to have a crowd not call for him to be killed. Not saying it was impossible, but not exactly the best chances in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Despite what Hollywood wants us to think, in the late republican period, very few gladiators fought to the death. Contracts for renting gladiators usually included language calling for extra payment if the fihgter was killed or permanently injured. The games were often paid for by low level politicians trying to make a name for himself. He was called the editor and made the final life/death decision. So every time he had to decide, in the back of his mind was the question, \u201cCan I afford to let this guy die?\u201d The answer was usually no. Few gladiator fights ended in death. In fact, some people sold themselves into slavery to a gladiator school, invested the money, and lived off the earnings when they retired \u2014 usually after five or six years. ",
