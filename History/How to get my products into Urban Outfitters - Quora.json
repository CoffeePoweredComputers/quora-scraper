            "answer_text": "I used to be a buyer at Urban Outfitters. The good news is that buyers are young and have a lot of autonomy to try new things for the store and website. And they try a lot of things. When the buyer tries a new item they will order 10\u2013500 units depending on a range of factors and where they would like to test it. (Website, select stores, etc) The bad news is there are some requirements that make it difficult for inexperienced designers to get their ideas tested. These were the problems that caused most new products to get a NO from me. The production costs were too high.The minimum order requirements were too high.The lead time was too long.If the product sold well, it would take too long to get 1000\u201310000 more units in stock.Make sure you know how you are going to get these things work for Urban before you get a meeting, or you will get a no. If you have a bad first meeting, it's very hard to get a second one. ",

            "answer_text": "As with any product it is important to get it in front of buyers Your best resource may be the company itself. Ask when it's buyers and product managers hold buying meetings And ask how you can either present a sample of your product or perhaps present your product to buyers in person. Be prepared to do this several times and perhaps never get an answer ; buyers see countless products every cycle and yours will likely be treated like all others. in past consumer goods marketing positions I taught my sales force to get our brands in front of product managers using less than direct sales techniques. It is harder to quantify but it is my belief that it helped us close the sale. ",
