            "answer_text": "As a Scandinavian myself (Norwegian), I can attest to that no, not every Scandinavian is blonde, blue-eyed, slender and good looking. The Scandinavian countries are quite genetically diverse in fact, due to the Viking age. What do I mean about that? Well, the vikings didn\u2019t just plunder and trade around the world, they also had their way with the women, which often resulted in children. But the vikings were gentlemen, so they often took the pregnant women back home, resulting in much (obviously thinned out) African, Iberian, Slavic, Baltic, and maybe a little Greek genes in the population. Also, this goes both ways. There occasionally, though very rarely, pops up a blue-eyed baby in North Africa for example. So, what does all this mean? The Scandinavian people are just as much brown-haired as they are blonde and just as much brown-eyed as they are blue-eyed. The exact numbers I do not know, but my point is, there is a lot of both. I, for example, have brown-grey-ish hair, and blue eyes. My skin is a little pale, but can get very tan. It has been described as olive skin. This means that my skin is able to produce much melanin, a southern trait, as melanin is only relevant in more sunny areas, whilst it is not beneficial in less sunny areas. Obviously, this all doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll find black people in the Scandinavian population who aren\u2019t immigrants or the progeny of immigrants. But you will find people with brown hair, brown eyes and tan, golden or olive skin. The skin part isn\u2019t as common as the others things, but it still happens. As for the slender part, a lot of it has to do with height. Scandinavian people are at their core a Germanic people, even though they are riddled with southern and eastern genes from the Viking age and even later immigration. Now, the Germanic preset is blond, blue-eyed and tall, indeed. And it is the tall genes in Scandinavians that make them slender. Obviously, there are shorter Scandinavians due to all the other genes in the mix, but the preset is tall. Just look at the people of Netherlands. Another point to add is that the Scandinavian preset might not be just blonde. You see, Scandinavian genes are within the Germanic ethnicity, but yet they have their little quirks that make them a distinct subgroup. One of these traits might be ginger hair. This is theoretical, but it has a lot of evidence to back it up. Scientists believe the ginger gene might have originated in the Scandinavian ethnicity, or at least influenced it heavily. Now, one of the countries with the most ginger people is Ireland. Before, scientists believed this gene was a Celtic trait, but that might not be true. The highest density of ginger people in Ireland is in Dublin, which was one of the biggest viking colonies. Also, there is a spot in Russia with a relatively great ginger density, a spot that was also colonized by vikings. Actually, the viking colonization, plunder and trade map coincides quite well with a map of ginger gene density. So, the ginger gene might have started in Scandinavia, and have been brought around the world by Vikings, the most influenced place being Ireland. Another point strengthening this theory is Norse Mythology. In Norse Mythology, one of the main gods, Thor, is described as having red hair and a red beard. Now, the Norse Mythology predates the Viking era, which means Norsemen knew about ginger hair before they ventured into the big, wide world. This means that there is a high probability that many ginger Norsemen lived in ancient Scandinavia. So, what was my point with this? Well, that the Scandinavian preset might not just be blonde, but maybe also ginger. ",

            "answer_text": "I can speak for Norway, as I\u2019ve spent considerable time there, and am currently dating a Norwegian. Most Norwegian girls are naturally blonde, especially in their youth. Their hair goes from white or flaxen in their childhood, to golden blonde in their twenties. As far as eye color, blue eyes are definitely the norm, but it should be noted that it\u2019s a very different \u201cblue\u201d than what we Americans are used to. My girlfriend\u2019s eyes are actually a very pale blue-gray, like the color of storm clouds. This color seems to be very common amongst Northern Europeans, while it is extremely rare where I live (Pennsylvania). Regarding \u201cslender\u201d build, I don\u2019t think that accurately describes them. I\u2019ve noticed that while the girls there are generally tall, they are also firmly built, having dense legs and hard stomachs, thick behinds and large chests. Basically, the bodies that American girls aspire to have after months of working out and packing on the protein, Norwegian girls have naturally. There are many slender girls there, but they tend to be vegan, Instagram model-types, and shouldn\u2019t be regarded as an archetypal representation. While it certainly goes to subjective opinion, I think it is fair to say that Nordic girls tend to be more \u201cattractive\u201d in their features than women anywhere else. Narrow foreheads, small noses, fair skin, high cheekbones, chiseled bone structure, and defined jawlines make them all look like Grecian sculptures. The Vikings can be thanked for this; centuries of selective breeding with attractive females, combined with killing off or abandoning of the uglier ones, has made for a very beautiful race of people. Sorry for focusing mainly on females, but I wasn\u2019t really studying the men while I was over there. Haha  Norwegian model Frida Aasen, ( from the same town as my gf actually). Perfect example of Nordic facial features. Notice how the eyes are more of a pale grey than a blue. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people are not blond, blue-eyed, slender AND good-looking. But most people here are at least one or more of these things.I also think that there\u2019s a higher percentage of these people in Scandinavian countries than other countries, now why is that? Why do the Scandinavians meet the beauty standard more than the rest?#1. It could have something to do with white people winning the race to dominate big parts of the industrialized world and therefore setting the white standard for beauty.  #2. And maybe it has something to do with the vikings taking a lot of slaves from other European countries, and ofc they would take the pretty ladies instead of the ugly ones\u2026. So the genetic pool in Scandinavia got better and better. #3. Blond and blue-eyed is linked to fair skin, which is great for survival purposes up here and therefore those genes have been carried on for generations. It just so happens that most of the world\u2019s population is in warmer climates where this is a disadvantage, and so it\u2019s seem as rare and special. #4. It could be that we have a lot of features seen at both beautiful AND healthy. As you might know the climate is harsh up here, so back in the day, only the best of the best would survive. There\u2019s very few of us still, but those that are alive now are strong and beautiful. #5. The slender part goes against number 4 in the sense that storing fat for winter would be considered good survival genes. BUT we do have a high level of education, living standard and low unemployment rates, which is proven to be related to people choosing healthier foods and lifestyles which prevents obesity and diseases. Now, of course not everyone in Norway fulfils all these criteria, there\u2019s an epidemic going on, people are getting fatter and sicker because of overeating and lack of exercise. But the increase in Norway is slower than in the US because of these factors. ",

            "answer_text": "Winter and Darkness are two things all Scandinavians have to survive. Walking in snow and surviving a winter until the 1900 was a hard task. Roads often had to be walked or plowed by hand, in areas where the snow is going as high as your hips. This would theoretically lead to longer lengs and a more \u201cslender\u201d look. activities related to snow are still a big part of Norwegian culture. For example cross country skiing. This could explain some of it. The fact that we are so white comes from the fact that we need to absorb more sunlight over a shorter period of time in the winter to help our bodies produce D vitamins and C vitamin. In fact white skincolor absorbs around 6 times more sunlight than black skinned people from the equator line. Just as alot of winter animals in Scandinavia has blue eyes also people have a higher percentage of blue eyes. This could point to the fact that the color spectrum in the north is different than along the equator. this because of the tilting of the earth compared to its circle around the sun.The fact that there is also a dimmer morning and night light. There is also a higher change in daytime lenght the further north you go up to the point where summers have 24 hours of daytime and winters have 24 hours of darkness.Blonde hair could also have a connection to these circumstances. The fact pointed out earlier that the vikings brought women who where pretty home as slaves would not guarantee pretty children. But if you consider the problems of isolation many of the vikings living in Northern Europe had and the problems of inbreeding resulting of this. It is not hard to imagine the benefits they had when they created a trade network going from the edges of West Europe down to Marocco,Malta into the Mediterranean and from Istanbul to Afghanistan trough Russia and back home to Scandinavia.From this route of trade and raiding over more than 200 years there is a high possibility that Norway had a high influx of fresh genes again resulting in fitter and better suited babies.Though what most people look at as \u201cscandinavians\u201d that are blonde and white is of \u201cgermanic\u201d ancestry. The real inhabitants of Norway over the longest time is the sami people of northern Norway,russian ,sweden and finnland. These people where reeindeer herders and hunters and still exist today.They are the original \u201cscandinavians\u201d and have a look more of a mix beetween European and Asian\\mongol looks. Or as Inuits or other north american natives. My two cents and ps! No we are not more \u201cpretty\u201d than other countries but if you compare health in Scandinavian compared to the rest of the world, we are some of the most Long living( People living to their 90s and 100s is not uncommon) and also No hunger and barely anyone living in poverty. Healthy people are most often seen as a more fit partner.Scandinavians if seen in a global view are a healthy population measured in almost any way. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, lets take that from the end; Blonde - well, most kids in DK are blonde or even whitehaired but with dark eyebrows (I was that way). When they get older, hair gets darker and the men start going bald. No hard humbers, but I think the percentage of bald men (I\u2019m looking like Walter White now) are higher in DK than in more southern countries. NO and SE got a higher percentage of blonds than DK, I believe it\u2019s SE that got the highest. Blue-eyed, well, there a a lot. Of course, I\u2019m a brown-eyed, as are most of my family, but my grand parents were blue eyed. I guess in DK its less than 50 percent that are blueeyed. Percentage goes up the farther north you go too. slender, ahh, that\u2019s not really genetics, but lifestyle. We do turn fat, but most people are actually quite active, esp. compared to people in US. Walking, biking etc. The height part of being slender, well, at 188 cm (6\u20192\u201d) I\u2019ve been considered stunted and answered to the name Shorty by whole life\u2026 or not. In 1864 DK and GE went to war (Danish stupidity, basically) and army records show, that the average height for a danish soldier was about 165 cm (5\u20194\u201d). In 1975 a man of about 175 was considered average height - now I believe it\u2019s about 180\u2013182 (6\u2019). So, foods more than genetics, I guess. Good-looking? Hm, last I was in Greece, this bunch of weird people in togas kept trying to get me up some mountain called Olympia, but\u2026 Actually, \u2018good looking\u2019 are culture based, and I really cant say if DK, NO, SE people are better looking than average. A fun fact is, that viking age graves from DK shows men and woman craniums being mostly alike; men were more femine and woman more masculine 1000 years ago. So, people change, And today we might average closer to a current ideal, but both people and culture might shift again ;) ",

            "answer_text": "I was once working for a Restaurant-Catering Service.  We had an event in Rishon-le-Tsion near the outskirts of Tel Aviv. We were setting up the tables when the guests started arriving. There were about a 100 of them. They were mostly blond, blue-eyes, fine-looking, of intelligent mien, men, women, and children.  I remember thinking they must all be the children of Jews from Germany. This surprised me since the Jews from Germany I was familiar with though often fair were not as blondish as all that. It turned out that these were indeed the children of Jewish immigrants but from Iraq not Germany. The Jews of Iraq are usually of Mediterranean type appearance sometimes fair and sometimes darkish. Some are very fair. This particular group apparently belonged to one large family. Since Sephardic Jews used to prefer intermarrying mainly with their cousins I guess it stayed in the family. Before that I had had a similar experience with Jews from Tunis. About 20% of the Jews of Tunis (who are often blond) believed they descend from the Tribe of Zebulon. Zebulon was exiled with the Ten Tribes and lost with them. Nevertheless, small minority groups from each tribe did re-attach themselves to Judah as explained by Nachmanides (\u201cSafer Ha-Gaulah\u201d). Incidentally the idea existed in works on race from ca. the 1920s that the Mediterranean race though usually tanned in color would spontaneously bring forth blond hair specimens at the rate of ca. 15%.

            "answer_text": "It's true that we all have blue eyes. This gene is very strong. My family is 100% Scandinavian, and even when my family members have married Hispanic or brown eyed men, their children have always had bright blue eyes. While all of us tend to have bright blonde hair when we're young, it doesn't stay this way as we get older. Some of my cousins have red hair, mine turned into a dirty blonde as I got older, and my parents both have brown hair. Finns and Norwegians have more predominantly blonde hair, but Swedes tend to have darker hair. Scandinavians are not that slender. In fact, we are husky people. Years of feasting on potatoes and Viking breeding have given us broad shoulders, thick mid-sections, muscular thighs and butts, and a generally large bone structure. We are heavier in general. With girls with the same height and body fat percentage as me, I am always heavier because our bone structure is built heavier. We are large people. I do not have a single male relative under 6 feet tall. My shortest female relative is 5\u20325\u2033 but we average around 5\u20328\u2033. I am 6 feet tall. I've not found Scandinavians to be better looking in general. Some are incredibly good looking, some are just average, others are quite homely. But Scandinavians tend to be tall, have strong bone structures, blue eyes, and large lips which are considered attractive in this time. My family is 50% Norwegian and 50% Swedish. Here's a picture of me and my dad. He's 6\u20324 and I'm 6\u20320. (I'm in heels)  And here's my mom and sisters too!  Here I am in Thailand for comparison to non-Scandinavians haha! As you can see, we're not small people.  ",

Most have light brown hair like Pewdiepie, which is not considered blond in Scandinavia but is considered blonde in most other parts of the world. Most infants are born bald here and their hair as children is almost white. But the hair darkens when they get older. Light brown is most common, then dirty blonde, then normal brown, then light yellow hair, then red hair, and then almost white hair like infants. Dark brown and black hair is something I have never seen a Scandinavian person have. Most adult Scandinavians are not slender, but the young people are. The average height for an 18 year old is 179 cm, which is basically the same as the adult average (180cm), and the average weight is 64kg which is very skinny. But the average weight for an adult man is 83kg. That's pretty big. But that's mostly because people in their 40s get very fat and don't stay lean. I don't think they have long legs either. They're longer than East Asians, but shorter than Africans Most Scandinavians have narrow hips (even the women) and wide shoulders and if they are fat most of the fat gets stored in the gut or the legs. This makes females less attractive in my opinion. Add to that a very strong chin which can look kinda witch-like, and that is why I don't think Scandinavians are very good looking. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually most are, but not all. There were the paleolithic hunter gatherers in the Iron age before the IndoEuropeans came. Most came through Finland although a friend of mine were researching and one tribe, the Sudoni, came up the shore and eventually took ship for Sweden. Still most of the new population pressure was coming from the east, pushing west the original inhabitants. I\u2019ve been told the western fishermen of Norway are often fairly dark, with brown eyes and dark hair. And they are hard to understand by normal Norwegians. Still you are going to find a lot of blue eyes. They are not an accident. As people came north from Africa, they had less sunlight. And less Vit D. Now they didn\u2019t know this, but the paler your skin, the more Vit D you got and the better hunter, warrior, gatherer, etc. that you were. It appears the first blue eyes showed up with a mutation \u2018SAXX something\u2019 that dumped a lot of melanin which is what colors all our skins. Its just how much. Now the production of melanin by melanocytes often takes awhile to get going. This is why babies are born with blue eyes and then they turn (usually brown). The brown eyes are created by melanin, just like brown skin. Be aware though the Norse took slaves from all over and frequently married many of the female slaves. It was illegal for a woman to marry a male slave. So the DNA base of Norsefolk is very diverse. All the way down to Byzantium and the Swedes traded in Russia and China. And no doubt brought back many wives. Unlike the legends, the Vikings in fact couldn\u2019t care less about race. They even fought among each other and took slaves of the losers. In fact Russia is called that because it was taken over by a Swedish clan, the Rus. ",

            "answer_text": "Funny the ratio of Scandinavians to non-Scandinavians (Americans of Scandinavian descent are not Scandinavian) answering this question. As for people who've actually lived in Scandinavia their entire life, if they're being honest they'll tell you that the vast majority of the adult population are not naturally blond (kids are a different story), but rather various shades of brown. Light eyes are more common than dark eyes but the latter are commonplace as well. As for the good-looking part, that's subjective of course but in general we're no better looking than any other Europeans. Even with regards to height, if you look at height charts you'll see Scandinavians are about as tall as any other Northern/Central European (about 1.80 cm for men and 1.66 for women), so nothing special there either. Personally, I think most of these stereotypes are results of confirmation bias, probably dating back to Nordicist and Nazi theories about the Nordic master race. Even some of the answers on this notoriously PC site seem to credit vikings for practicing some kind of eugenic selective breeding, which is completely absurd and unfounded. ",

            "answer_text": "Not all blonde, blue or light eyed people are good-looking. It's not considered an asset where it's common among the majority population. Highlight the words majority population \u2014 we've always had ethnic minorities in Fennoscandia such as the Saami and the Roma populations for example. We were never homogenous. Hailing from the land of the palest of the pale I see little to no connection between coloration and attractiveness. Many, like myself, dye their naturally blonde hair dark or whatever they're into at the moment. I feel like I'm a blank canvas in my natural state: no visible eye brows or lashes and the hair color blending to the tone of my skin. It's much the same across the pond in Sweden. It's true that Scandinavians are tall. At 5'4\" or 165 cm I'm about an average height woman in Finland. (My mother has some Lappish ancestry and is just 5 foot tall. The people with Scandinavian ancestry are the tallest in Finland.) Standing in a crowded metro in Oslo I feel like there are a lot of butts at my eye level! I suspect that the Dutch, however, are the tallest in Europe. It's easier to hide a couple extra pounds in a large frame and therefore appear slender even if you aren't clinically speaking. Body weight is closely linked to lifestyle and eating habits. Such a generalisation cannot be made today. Height is also linked to eating habits and living standards \u2014 over generations. ",

If you consider tall, blonde and blue eyes better then brown hair and eyes, medium height then you should think of where your ideal is coming frome. Sure there's a large representation of genetically predisposed persons with light hair and blue eyes in the northern parts of Europe but when you start to look what really matters these superficial traits are not what counts. Besides that the only time you actually notice any difference is when you go abroad and are surrounded with \u201cnon blondes\u201d. Then you get the exotism thing going and people tend to stay on your surface instead of hwo you are. Perhaps flattering at first but just as annoying as any racist behavior. The benefits? Never ever being subjected to any form of controls at borders, peapol questioning your motives or your actions, police allways treats you nicely since you are perceived as honest and forthright. The negative, being on the upper parts of a scale is just as bad as being on the lower side. ",

Slender: yes For the most part. At least in Denmark, there is an unwritten rule that to get hired/promoted in work, you have to be in shape. How can you take care of the company if you can\u2019t take care of yourself? Also, they walk and bike everywhere. Good-looking: Hellyes/Hellja My friend who is a girl texted me and asked if everyone was tall\u2014because I recently visited the Netherlands where there\u2019s the tallest people on earth\u2014and I responded \u201cno\u201d. Everyone is good looking. Objectively yes and subjectively yes. For the most part, majority wins. ",

He did not know where the street I was looking for was located so he called his colleagues. They came to help us. It was incredible - five light blond men, all taller than myself (I am 6\u20323 / 190 cm). Of course, not everybody is blond and tall in Denmark. But many people are. The earlier experience was at Solovki, an island in the White Sea in the North of Russia.  I participated in the Solovki archeological expedition in 2001. Three archeologists directed the expedition. Others included few grown-up volunteers from Moscow and the nearby city of Arkhangelsk and about twenty high school students from Arkhangelsk. These high school students (90% of them girls) were all very light blond, and quite slender. So I guess there are many such people in Arkhangelsk. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know about the truth behind this stereotype, but I do know that it is a stereotype even young German men indulge in. About ten years ago, I was living in an intentional community that periodically had young German men come to volunteer in lieu of military conscription. The community drew many people from around the world who were interested in some aspect of Anthroposophy, whether Waldorf education, biodynamic farming, eurythmy, or medicine, etc. (I was there because of an interest in biodynamic farming myself.) So these young German men heard that we were expecting two Swedish girls to come volunteer for a few weeks, and they got very excited at the prospect. However, after the girls arrived, they essentially ignored them. When I asked why, after they\u2019d been so excited, they grumbled that the girl\u2019s didn\u2019t look Swedish. They weren\u2019t blonde or blue-eyed, or slender. Both Malin and Ilona were brown-eyed brunettes who happened to be curvaceous. Malin was fairskinned, while Ilona had Ethiopian ancestry. But, in my estimation, they were both beautiful, and Ilona was the sweetest person I met in my year there. The experience only reinforced my indulgence in the stereotype that teenage boys are idiots.

            "answer_text": "I have lived in Finland for a while now and have traveled throughout the Nordics. Compared to other countries with \u201cwhite\u201d people, there are a lot more people who are very light-skinned, blonde and blue-eyed. People are taller on average than in the more southern countries. As an aside, it is interesting to see that in Finland (which is technically a a Nordic country and not Scandinavia per se) there seem to be a section of the population of people who are very short as well as a population of people who are very tall. But in general, the younger people in Finland tend to be taller than the older people due to improvements in nutrition and healthcare. As for most of them being slender and good-looking, that is very subjective I suppose. My spouse is Finnish and she is very good-looking to me :). I do not personally think that they are any more good-looking in Scandinavia than anywhere else but maybe because tall, slim blondes (real and fake) are literally a dime a dozen in Helsinki/Stockholm/Oslo/Copenhagen etc.. so they are nothing special for me. Probably, if you are from the south, then it might seem something special (We had some Southern European colleagues visit here while back and they could not stop talking about how attractive the men/women were).

For slimness, obesity isn\u2019t perhaps as common as some other countries, but Scandinavians tend to be solidly built, so don\u2019t expect twiggish human beings. The nordic people tend to have good bone structure and muscle mass. As for handsome, that would depend on the individual, and the beholder\u2019s taste in features. Funny story about that. I grew up in an area of Canada with a lot of Northern Europeans, Germanics, Dutch, Swedish, and such. My sister and I travelled to Los Angeles California, home of the Hollywood blonde. But for us, it felt like the opposite. Far more dark hair, eyes, and skin. Most everyone was darker than we were, and we were taller too, despite being average at home. More pale too; Californians and Americans in general tend to be more tanned. So that was neat, and unexpected. ",

            "answer_text": "It is hard to estimate how many Scandinavians are blond, because the definition of blond is kind of vague and blonds have interbred with redheads and brunes for centuries, and some black-haired people as well, although black hair (and also dark skin) has grown more common just lately with increased immigration. But yes, Scandinavia and especially western Finland has the most blonds in the world by far. Nordic people also tend to be tall (although not quite as tall as the Dutch) which make them look slender despite having normal weight. In recent years overweight is becoming more common even here, especially among the working class men. So the Nordic countries is your best chance at finding tall, slender blonds in this world. But they are not a compact majority by any means, just fairly common. Let\u2019s say this is a place where people won\u2019t react seeing that kind of people. They are not remarkable or memorable here. ",

Those are averages. I know men that are 160 as well as 200. Good-looking is a matter of perspective. I don\u2019t find light eyes or hair to be more attractive than dark eyes and hair myself. ",

It always manages to amuse me how people can be deceived by hair dye. Most Scando girls use hair bleach. In fact every Swedish/Norwegian girl I know uses yellow/platinum blonde hair dye. You can see it in the roots just as you can see it in most of the girls pictured above in other people\u2019s answers. Most of my English friends who go to Scandinavia often comment on how \u2018they thought girls would be blonder and not so fake looking\u2019. And it is true. Without hair dye, Scandinavian people would be just as dark haired as everybody else in Western Europe. I would also like to point out that a lot of these called traits Scandos have picked up from Vikings, other races share the same traits. The Vikings were not more special than anyone else. Regarding blue eyes, I actually notice people from Ireland to be overall more Blue eyed than Scandos. Just my opinion though from travelling. Ps my wife is Norwegian and has red hair. Real red hair.

Aside from facial features, northern European women are not affectionate. They are serious, cold and distant IMO. They also prefer to date their own race in my experience. I think they are a bit overrated honestly. They also usually age much faster and have more wrinkles than african, asians and Latina women. ",

Helsinki is considered world capital of blondes, with almost half the population with some shade of blond. But most people in northern Finland actually are black haired. The country where I personally found almost everybody blond was Iceland. Now, good looking is relative and subjective impression. One observation: outside of Denmark I hardly ever see an obese or even overweight person in Scandinavia. Most are slender shaped. Most Norwegians (outside of Oslo) actualy look athletic and very fit and healthy. And in Finland I observe many pretty girls with very handsome features. While many Norwegian girls remind me of Vikings, when sporting broad shoulders and very impressive handshakes. ",

We\u2019re not all blue eyed blondes. (In fact, I was once told I couldn\u2019t possibly be natural brown-haired and blue-eyed because that sort of combination just didn\u2019t exist. It does, but it should tell you something about brown eyes being relatively common as well considering that this person had never met a Dane with naturally brown hair and blue eyes - and I was definitely not the first person they met.)

Not necessarily slender, but some are. Some may be simply healthy and well-built. They tend to have regular features and high cheekbones, which are appealing. They tan easily and love the sun. I think they tend to be tall now, like Americans have become, but generations ago that was not the case so much. I make this comment primarily from observing the Danes in the Danish church where I sing. There really is a preponderance of very pretty women. The men vary in attractiveness, but I would say none are homely. I only know one Swede and indeed she\u2019s a pretty blonde with blue eyes. I personally am 1/4 Danish and 1/4 Norwegian. I met some of on my third cousins (up the Sorenson line) in Denmark and they are quite attractive. My Norwegian cousins are attractive as well, although not all blonde. ",

Those traits are much more prevalent in Scandinavia than in most other places, but the majority have brownish hair, and I\u2019d say blue eyes are about 50%. In Sweden, only a few, sparsely populated areas have more than 50% blonde and blue-eyed. In addition, the gene for blue eyes is recessive, so that percentage is bound to go down a bit through the next century or so, maybe to 40%. (After that, I\u2019m not going to speculate!) ",

The primary facial structure, the body types, eyes, mouth, ears, hair, everything, everything seem to look \u201cideal\u201d. Their primary behaviour is even more attractive. All those models you see on Instagram? They are most likely Swedes. Even if a person is only half Swedish, their looks are just more \u201cexotic\u201d but still have the swedish beauty. It is truly a bless and I actually am smiling more when I am sorrounded by such beautiful females and males while walking in town. Thanks ",
