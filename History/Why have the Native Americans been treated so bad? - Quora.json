            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give an unpopular answer and say, they were not treated bad at first and in fact helped build the United States of America and supported us. Spanish Catholic folklore have sort of altered the original stories, because Christopher Columbus did in fact enslave and mistreat natives. Many people have been misinformed about why we celebrate Thanksgiving, and the correct history of Pilgrim Fathers in the 13 colonies. so buckle up for another history lesson while I provide factual information with trusted sources. In The Beginning: To start off I think we need to understand who the \u201cpilgrims\u201d were. \u201cpilgrim\u201d was a modern term coined by catholics in the 19th century, after the wave of Irish and Italian Catholic immigration in the 19th century. Who were they actually?  They were actually called \u201cseparatists\u201d, because they separated from the church. They also didn't wear roman nun outfits like is depicted in our history books today. They wore colorful handmade clothing. They were extremely poor. The were peasants that were be persecuted in England by King George III for refusing to accept the Church Of England. They were orthodox protestants or now called anglo-saxon protestants. They refused to celebrate Christmas or Easter, they only celebrated one holiday and I will get to that holiday in a moment. When Americans banned Christmas So these peasants convinced George III to fund a trip on the Mayflower to set up colonies in North America, because it was a military strategy. I will get to that later, but he allowed them go leave this land but that they would have to endure a brutal ship ride over with little food to eat. The protestants were desperate for religious freedom and to leave the chains of the Church Of England. So they boarded the Mayflower and set their sights on hope and freedom in a brave new world.  Let\u2019s understand how difficult and scary that had to have been. There was no understanding of trees in England as King George ordered all trees within his kingdom to be cut down for lumber. You step onto a foreign land where you see nothing but trees. The ecosystem is entirely different. You don\u2019t know how to farm or hunt, you don\u2019t know what you can eat. 44% of the original colonists of 104 would die after the first winter from disease and starvation. King George was about to give up. Does that mean 104 peasants were able to commit genocide against the estimated 20 million natives living in North America in those times? Let us make this clear. The United States exists today because the indigenous natives built the 13 colonies. Do you really believe we built the 13 colonies all by ourselves when we couldn\u2019t even farm. This is where the story of Thanksgiving comes into play, let us go down that path. Indigenous influence of the 13 colonies have been whitewashed from history books, but that is the very reason why we celebrate Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is the only modern holiday that is also celebrated by natives across the country. It represents the story of the Wampanoag tribe. The Wampanoag tribe was the first tribe the \u201cpilgrims\u201d came in contact with when they made their first settlement in Massachusetts. The Wampanoags and Patuxet tribe saw that the settlers were dying in great numbers, so they traded knowledge for clothing made from our wives. Ever play Oregon Trail? That is accurate.  Uncovering the True History of Thanksgiving The Thanksgiving feast we celebrated today represents the first Thanksgiving, after the signing of the 1621 treaty. In the story of Tisquantum (Squanto) teaching the first colonies how to farm corn and fish on the new land and they understood English. Why? He was already a slave owned by the Spanish Empire. I will get to that after I continue the story of Thanksgiving. Squanto: The True Story Of The Native American Behind The First Thanksgiving The Thanksgiving Tale Is a Harmful Lie. As a Native American, I\u2019ve Found a Better Way to Celebrate \u201dSquanto taught the Pilgrims how to cultivate crops that would help them to get through the next winter. The Pilgrims were delighted to find that the corn and squash were easy to grow in the Massachusetts climate.\u201d \u201dPeople forget they had just landed here and this coastline looked very different from what it looks like now. And their culture\u2014new foods, they were afraid to eat a lot of things. In the true history of Thanksgiving, they were very vulnerable and we did protect them, not just support them, we protected them. You can see throughout their journals that they were always nervous and, unfortunately, when they were nervous they were very aggressive.\u201d  He was later disavowed by the Waopananauh Confederacy for doing this and going against his slave masters, so he became a refugee of the English settlers and we liberated and protected him from death. The popular story of today that settlers arrived and started committing mass genocide is a very inaccurate falsehood. The fact of the matter is, almost all indigenous deaths during this time period that can be attributed to English settlers was from foreign pathogens. Thanksgiving guilt trip: How warlike were Native Americans before Europeans showed up? Reject the Lie of White \"Genocide\" Against Native Americans American History Myths Debunked: The Indians Weren\u2019t Defeated by White Settlers https://www.cracked.com/article_19864_6-ridiculous-lies-you-believe-about-founding-america.html Building The United States: Now we move on to the creation of the 13 colonies. We need to make clear. The English had a strategic reason militarily to set up colonies in North America. The English were by far from the first settlers in North America, and it wasn\u2019t the \u201cNative Americans\u201d like you are told. When the pilgrims arrived, most every native tribe was already enslaved and owned by the Spanish Empire and France. This is what has been whitewashed from your history books. The Italian and Spanish conquistadors owned almost all of North and South America. It belonged to them going all the way back to the 13th century, after Christopher Columbus discovered North America. Spanish Empire - Wikipedia  These native ingenious tribes that you saw, were in fact elements of the Spanish Empire that were forced to perform hard labor such as build confederacies and cities across North America. These were spanish cities with spanish symbolism from European settlers and South America. Conquistadors made it a point to mate with ingenious people to spread their heritage and bloodline across North America. They were called the \u201cM\u00e9tis\u201d and not the only mixed group. They were responsible for almost wiping out the buffalo population in the midwest with \u201chunting parties\u201d before english settlers even got there. M\u00e9tis - Wikipedia When the English arrived and started building the 13 colonies, we were engaging in warfare against the Spanish Catholic Empire. That is why when the 13 colonies fought for independence from England, they allied with the French because France was at war with the Spanish. If France helped us, we helped them which would allow us to liberate North American ingenious tribes from Spain and gain us access to more land by treaty. This is why in 1792 the United States put in the first amendment that the government cannot establish a religion, because we had fought religious persecution from the Spanish and English. We were liberating the west from the Catholic and English Empire. It was the shot heard around the world that inspired what was called the War Of The Pyrenees, or better known as the \u201cFrench Revolution\u201d. War of the Pyrenees - Wikipedia Second Treaty of San Ildefonso - Wikipedia  It was in 1800 when France defeated the Spanish in North America by signing the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso, which gave North America back to the France. Who in turn sold it to us during the Louisiana Purchase for being allies during the Revolutionary War. The native tribes in Louisiana that were relocated by Andrew Jackson were already enslaved. We were relocating them because we won the war and freed the slaves that were already being mistreated by Spain. The Indian Removal Act Of 1830 was relocating them farther west where they were freed. It may have been a gruesome long walk, but it puts it into historical perspective. We again didn\u2019t just arrive in North America, there were many others there before us committing atrocities. There was no mass genocide of tribes committed by the United States of America. We know this because of what happened after the Civil War. Keep reading and you will find out. After The Civil War: At the 19th century, ingenious people are more powerful and more liberated than ever before. We know this because by the mid 19th century not only did natives across the United States own land that was honored by treaty in reservations, they even had their own strong political party in the Congress and Senate. Know Nothing - Wikipedia  Mockingly referred to as the \u201cKnow-Nothings\u201d, they were actually the Native American Party. Ingenious tribes teamed up with anglo-saxon protestants in the Democratic Party to stop a new wave of Irish Catholic immigrants that were looking to settle out west. They feared that Catholics were going to enslave their own people again and remove their land.  George Copway - Wikipedia Indigenous writer George Copeway joined the movement, which eventually convinced many ingenious tribes of the South to join the confederacy because they wanted to retain their rights to own slaves. Not only that, but to avoid Irish immigration and losing their land that Lincoln threatened to take away after the war was won. So the Confederacy signed additional treaties with hundreds of tribes across the United States adding increased federal protections for tribal lands. The confederacy naturally favored sovereignty, and many natives tribes favored a weaker federal government. Confederacy signs treaties with Native Americans Lincoln and the Irish, the untold story revealed for the first time Lincoln and the Sioux Did Abraham Lincoln Order the Execution of 38 Dakota Fighters? Abraham Lincoln and Native Americans  Slavery was abolished as the Confederacy was defeated, but their worst fears came true. What followed by the Lincoln and Grant administrations would completely destroy the mutual respect and relationship the United States had with indigenous tribes going forward. https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/lincoln-and-the-sioux/?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=21E22C41453148DA53FE6B9B2981A25F&gwt=pay&assetType=REGIWALL In 1871 President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Indian Appropriations Act, which withdrew federal recognition from Indian Tribes and their land as political entities, which could be contracted by treaties with the United States. This was the beginning of the end for Indian sovereignty. In 1887 President Grover Cleveland signed the Dawes Act (General Allotment), which provided for the sale of \"surplus\" indigenous lands that were now no longer federally respected. This paved way for thousands of new Catholic immigrants to relocate Indian tribes to small federally operated reservations, now that their treaties were no longer protected. It was the federal buyout of Indian land.  In 1901 President Teddy Roosevelt used the now emptied land to create the United States Forest Service (USFS), establishing 150 national forests, 51 federal bird reserves, 4 national game preserves, 5 national parks, and 18 national monuments. In 1902, Commissioner of Indian Affairs William Atkinson Jones sent an order to all reservations that superintendents must cut their long hair and forced them to adopt Christianity. Their identity would be whitewashed. The Infamous Government Order Mandating Forced Haircuts For Native Americans The 1906 American Antiquities Act added an additional approximately 230 million acres of public land that further relocated native tribes. This would all happen within a 30 year timeframe. The entire western half of the United States before Lincoln was considered \u201cIndian homeland\u201d. Interactive Time-Lapse Map Shows How the U.S. Took More Than 1.5 Billion Acres From Native Americans Modern Ages: Today indigenous tribes of America are federally recognized, which means they are not independent or sovereign in nature. They do not own their own land or have their own government or economy. This is a phenomenon of the 20th century. Before the 20th century we respected and honored 386 treaties that we signed from 1776 to 1868.  This led to the American Indian Movement in the 1970\u2019s. Tribes started to understand that the federal government after the Civil War had decimated their lands and were being mistreated by the Catholic Church once again. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/01/20/catholic-churchs-shameful-history-native-american-abuses/%3foutputType=amp Death by Civilization  So In 1978, President Jimmy Carter setup a federal land claims commission in Congress where tribes visited to map out land stolen during the creation of our National Parks. They would be offered financial reimbursement in years followed. Map of Judicially Established Indian Land   Notice the similarities between the two maps, and notice that the Eastern half of the United States is blank. Why? The eastern half of the United States has honored treaties, and in particular in Massachusetts. It\u2018s called the Treaty Of Watertown. It was the first treaty written by the United States in 1776, and it is still honored to this day. That\u2019s why people living in Nova Scotia can join the United States armed forces. Treaty of Watertown - Wikipedia https://www.watertown-ma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/861/Treaty-of-Watertown---1776?bidId=  Today there are a few tribes that have held out like Mi'kmaq citizens. They are called \u201cunrecognized tribes\u201d, because they refuse to participate in gambling as a means of recognition. They refuse to agree to economic terms set by federal laws. Federally recognized tribes are more economically powerful than at any point in history, only we have to ask where does the money go? Greed, Corruption and Indian Country\u2019s New Welfare States Some \u201cUnrecognized\u201d Tribes Still Waiting After 130 Years As Native American Casinos Proliferate, The Social Costs Of The Gambling Boom Are Ignored FBI PROBES MAFIA, NATIVE AMERICAN GAMING LINKS Tribes Discover The Two Sides Of Gambling Coin Corruption Following Prosperity's Footstep Onto Reservations It\u2019s important we realize this because ingenuous tribes were not being mistreated in the past, they are being mistreated right now. Suicide rates are 1.5 times higher on tribal lands. The health expectancy on a reservation is 20 years less on average than outside of reservations. Very few politicians are willing to bring up these facts. These atrocities are being committed by their own people, as the saying goes too many chiefs and not enough indians.  5 Ways The Government Keeps Native Americans In Poverty Native Americans Feel Invisible In U.S. Health Care System What People Get Wrong About Suicides On Tribal Lands Conclusion: History books and modern curriculum are leaving out the virtues of Christopher Columbus, because it has become popular to say that Americans committed genocide against ingenious people. When you look at the actual facts and look at older history books that actually go over Christopher Columbus, you realize this can\u2019t be farther from the truth. How could Americans have conquered land already conquered by Spain? Do you realize why South America and Mexico and many parts of the United States speak Spanish? Has any other country in the world treated their natives any better, or give them more financial support than we currently do today? Don\u2019t Be Fooled: Latino = Indigenous I have been so passionate about this topic, because the genocide story is used to attack American culture and heritage, ignoring the amazing things we did.

            "answer_text": "Why has mankind been treated so badly? Because every society in the world prior to 1776 was based on tribalism, that grew into a clan, that eventually became or was subject to some kind of a \u201cstrongman\u201d dictatorship. This was the case on every continent and by every people or race. They treated anybody that wasn\u2019t \u201cthem\u201d rather badly. Before Columbus, North America had about 12 million people in over 1000 tribes speaking more than 500 languages and dialects. Land ownership was determined by who could take and hold the land, and warfare, genocide, slavery, and every form of human savagery was practiced in the Americas the same as it was in Europe, Asia, etc. So what colonialism did was introduce the concept of land ownership and of right to real and personal property, which did not exist in America. But that made the hunter, gatherer, raider lifestyle of many Native tribes incompatible with \u201ccivilization.\u201d Some tribes were agrarian settlers who lived in the same village for generations, some were nomads who ranged across the land with the seasons, or by following a herd. Some of these tribes tried to get along with others, and some would kill anybody that got in their way, and there was a wide spectrum of behaviors between those two. So we aren\u2019t talking about sweet children of nature, but humans who behaved like humans did at that time. So let\u2019s fast forward, past all the Colonial and United States Indian Wars to when the US Government finally conquered the tribes and provided them with their own lands defined by boundaries. By 1890 the country had arrived at the modern reservation system (with still a lot of \u201ckinks\u201d to work out). These generally worked well for agrarian tribes of Puebloans, or villagers and but was difficult for the former nomadic hunter, raider, warrior tribes. Among things the government learned is that giving the Indians land, often ended with them being cheated out of it, so the reservations are Indian Land, but may not be sold, and is actually held in trust for the tribe by the government. Earlier the government wanted to have the Indians assimilate into American society, they took children from reservations and sent them to boarding schools where they were not only education but trained in the American Culture. This was not popular with the tribes, and the idea of assimilation was dropped. So where they ended up by about 1920 was with the tribes having and operating their own government with assistance from the US Bureau of Indian Affairs. This allowed the Tribes to continue with their own culture and lifestyle, which is what the did, including having day-schools on the reservation that their children attended like any other children. The downside of this is they continued to live in primitive homes as they always had, to practice their tribal medical traditions, and live in their own way, so compared with the rest of society they were impoverished. But it was the way they wanted to live, and they were most unhappy when \u201cWhite men\u201d tried to force change on them. Today the reservations, with the help of money earned at Indian casinos, have various enterprises that provide direct income to the tribes, and employment to tribal members. They have a middle-class income. They now have their own high schools and community colleges. They live in houses with plumbing, electricity, heating and cooling, phones, TV, internet, and pretty much all the modern conveniences. The problem with how bad Natives are treated is it depends on what you mean by bad. Natives have terrible social statistics, school drop-out rates, drug and alcohol use, crime, out of wedlock births, obesity, diabetes, heart problems, and suicide rates are very high among them. But who is being bad? They don\u2019t want the government telling them what to do, they are solving their own problems, and actually making good progress with it.
