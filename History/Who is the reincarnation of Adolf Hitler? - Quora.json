            "answer_text": "I look at this a bit different. A reincarnated soul, may not display the same behavior, frame of mind, etc., as that soul was in its previous life. After we died, we are questioned by the masters how we view now our past life. I believe after a review, we all learn that we could have done many things differently. Therefore, if Hitler would one day reincarnate, he may become a priest, or a great humanist. ",
