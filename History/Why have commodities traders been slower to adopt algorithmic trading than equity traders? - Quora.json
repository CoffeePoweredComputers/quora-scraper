            "answer_text": "Euan Sinclair'answer is spot on but I'd like to add something. Things, within the commodity space, are changing quickly and not all commodities \"run\" at the same speed. The energy sector in particular tends to move a lot more quickly than other markets like cattle or some illiquid agriculturals. Statistics and quant analysis are becoming key factors as far as commodity trading is concerned. Nevertheless, it's very difficult you are going to consistently make money trading commods if you don't know the whole fundamental procedures [shipping procedures, routes, storage, taxes, potential bans on specific producers, seasonality, geopolitical risks,etc] so being fast will not provide you any edge if you don't know what you are doing. IMHO, commodities are a lot more fascinating than equities and there are less frauds  [insider trading within the equity space is almost a daily practice even if it's difficult to prove and people are rarely punished]. Also, the nature of commodity markets is entirely different because many commodity firms are there only for hedging purposes and they tend to trade in the back of the curve because they want to hedge market risk on an order of, say, jet fuel oil which will be delivered 4 months from now and clearly in the 4th front months liquidity will be lower. Consequentially, the focus is on different deliveries whose risk needs to be mitigated in X, Y, Z months from now. Hence, trades and liquidity are more spread out and tend to be less concentrated because each delivery is a standalone market and each delivery point or hub is a different market with specific prices so HFT is not really an advantage in such environment. Stocks are totally different and have less regionalised markets. All in all, things are changing and quant analysis/trading will become more and more crucial within commodity industries. As far as traders are concerned, Euan has correctly put it: commodity traders tend to focus on 1-2 markets, because the knowledge required is really vast and the factors to monitor are a lot, so the degree of automation needed is lower. My 2 cents ",

            "answer_text": "There are several reasons.  First, and I think most fundamental, is that equity trading tends to be driven by statistics and commodity trading tends to be about knowledge. A lot of equity trading is driven by statistical arbitrage strategies which trade the statistical inter-relationships between hundreds or thousands of stocks. Not only can these be executed and monitored by computers, they have to be. Commodities aren't really like this. Most commodity traders trade only one or two things. To trade commodities you need to understand fundamentals such as crop conditions, weather effects, transport bottlenecks etc. These are different for each commodity. Even thing that might seem similar to an outsider (for example, beans and corn) are totally different in this regard. If you are only trading one thing, you don't need to be automated at all. Second, there is the issue of the exchanges. The SEC currently recognizes 18 equity exchanges. A number of high frequency strategies involve arbitrage and spreading between these exchanges. This needs to be totally computerized as speed is really the only factor in whether these strategies will be successful. In contrast, most commodities are listed on only one or two exchanges, so inter-exchange trading is not such a big deal. Finally, there is the size of the markets. Most commodities have an insignificant market share when compared to the equity market. So a lot of commodity traders are independent or very small companies. These operations can't really invest in technology even if they wanted to. Oh, and the average age of a cattle trader at the CME has to be nearly 60. To these guys a computer is a TV with a typewriter attached to it. ",
