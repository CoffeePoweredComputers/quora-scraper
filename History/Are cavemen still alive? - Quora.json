To know that you would need to search in places where only people who have inherited their introgressed genes can function normally, such as the Sherpa lands of the Himalayas. We would need to bulldoze most of the Amazon, Papua New Guinea, the Congo, and the 1/3 of North America that we can\u2019t field explore. But probably so. If you consider Australopithecus to be a caveman, we\u2019ve already found some. They\u2019re called Bili Apes, and they\u2019re only slightly more related to Chimps and Bonobos than we are. ",
