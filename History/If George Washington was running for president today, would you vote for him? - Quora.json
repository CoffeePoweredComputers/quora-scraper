            "answer_text": "No. Like many others, I don\u2019t like the fact that Washington owned slaves. He seemed to detest slavery. Yet, he owned quite a few. I don\u2019t have much of a stomach for hypocrisy. From what I\u2019ve read about him, he seemed like a decent and level-headed guy. He was the head of the Continental army, but the book I\u2019m currently reading paints him as an okay general, at best. This book, Ron Chernow\u2019s Alexander Hamilton, describes Hamilton as the man behind the scenes. His skill with a quill was vital to Washington during the Revolutionary War and during Washington\u2019s tenure as president. And that\u2019s just one of the ways he was helpful to Washington. Washington didn\u2019t even want to give him command of a battalion because he so strongly believed that he needed Hamilton. Without Hamilton, or at least someone else to help him, I feel as though Washington would appear to be less impressive than how he\u2019s viewed today. So, what exactly qualified a man like Washington to lead a country? The only thing I\u2019m getting from this book is that a lot of people united behind him, which is good for a nation in its infancy. But that doesn\u2019t automatically make a person fit to lead said nation. ",
