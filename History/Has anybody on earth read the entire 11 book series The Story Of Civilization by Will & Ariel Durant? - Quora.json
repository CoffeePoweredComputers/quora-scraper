            "answer_text": "I'm sure there are many people who have. Since Stefan Rudnicki started narrating them for Blackstone Audio, downloadable through Audible, I'm sure many more have picked them up\u2014people who didn't like the earlier narrations by Grover Gardner or Robin Field. I started off reading them in print (my parents had a copy) and read Audible, try it free - 30 day audiobooks free trial from Audible, Our Oriental Heritage and The Age of Faith\u2014that is, volumes I and IV\u2014but after they started coming out on Audible read by the magnetic Mr. Rudnicki I got irredeemably hooked, and have now, in one form or another, read all of them except the last third of the The Age of Napoleon, The Renaissance, and The Age of Voltaire. So I'm now nine-and-two-thirds out of 11. Not bad!  UPDATE: I've changed my mind on Grover Gardner, who I actually think is quite excellent, and his reading of The Age of Voltaire was tremendously good. I realize I also omitted one that I hadn't read\u2014The Age of Reason Begins\u2014but that's next. And finally I'll read and/or listen to The Renaissance which will mean I'll be done with all 11 hopefully before the year is out. ",

In the meantime I have done a fair amount of living. The first reading helped me understand what was going on in the world and what I saw in the world helps me understand the volumes better. Still Hobbes remarked that \u201cIf I had read as much as other men, I should have knoown as little.\u201d He was wrong, but it\u2019s amusing to mention it here. ",
