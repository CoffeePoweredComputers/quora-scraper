            "answer_text": "Kallar community of Tamil nadu was erroneously classified as Kutra Parambarai ( hereditary criminals ) by the British. They knew nothing about the ancient political history of the Sangam period Tamils . KALLARS were a selected group of brave Tamil warriors to whom the duty of bringing the cattle of the enemy kingdom stealthily,entrusted , before the war begins.. The main intention of the king was that cattle should not be killed during war time .If cattle are killed ,agricultural operations will come to an end .Though the king wins in the battle he will be a loser without getting any income as a result of poverty .This was the warfare technique of the Tamils .Ancient Tamil grammarian Tholkaappiyar ( 865 BCE) has also mentioned it as AA KOL \u0b86\u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb3\u0bcd . During Mahabaaratha period it was known as \u201cmaadu pidi candai \u201c ( cattle catching war ) .Innocent Kallar community was degraded and accused for no fault of its own . English proverb reminds us \u201c Ignorance of History will make the people Slaves for ever. No one has written the true history of the ancient Tamils properly. ",
