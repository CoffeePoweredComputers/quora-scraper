            "answer_text": " Luxor, Egypt. It was established as Waset in 3,200 BCE as the capital of Waset, the fourth Upper Egyptian district during the Old Kingdom. At that time it was a little trading town near the Nubian border. During parts of Middle Kingdom (2,040 to 1,750 BCE) and the New Kingdom (1,550 to 1,070 BCE) it was the capital of Egypt. During the Amarna Period (1353-1336 BCE) Thebes was the world's largest city with a population at around 80,000 people. Ramesses II moved the capital from Thebes to the newly built city of Pi-Ramesses (now the town of Avaris city), but remained a site of spirituality until about AD 500. Waset was destroyed many times. Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (667 BCE), who made the Egyptians rebuild the city as a compensation for their resistance to his rule. The city gradually recovered. It received its Greek name \u2014 Thebes \u2014 when Alexander the Great visited the place in 332. In 185 BCE, the city joined a Nubian uprising against Egypt, which was quickly suppressed by Ptolemy V. 50 years later the city joined a failed coup d\u2019etat to replace Ptolemy VIII. During the Roman occupation (30 BC-349 AD), the remaining communities clustered around the pylon of the Luxor temple. Thebes became part of the Roman province of Thebais, later split into Thebais Superior, centred at the city, and Thebais Inferior. A Roman legion was headquartered in Thebes at the time of Roman campaigns in Nubia. Its decline continued. According to Strabo, the Thebes was relegated to a village by the first century CE. According to Christian legends, the Theban Legion, a Roman legion garrisoned in Thebes converted to Christianity en masse and were martyred together, in 286 CE. A see was established at Thebes probably before 325 and the Council of Nicaea. Many churches were built into the ruined ancient temples. Paphnutius, a disciple of Saint Anthony the Great, was the bishop of Thebes in the 4th century. His contemporary Paul of Thebes, known as Amba Bola or the First Hermit, lived in the Theban deserts. Coptic monks made the majority of Thebes\u2019 population for the following centuries. By the 8th century Egypt came under the Umayyad Caliphate, and the little village that was Thebes came to be known to Arabs as the village of Djeme. During the Abbasid Caliphate, fortification or al-Uqsur were built around the village, from which evolved its modern name Luxor. A mosque was built for the local sheikh Abu al-Haggag in the 12th century. Much of the ancient city was reclaimed by the desert. When Napoleon arrived in 1798 to look for the ancient glory of Egypt, Luxor was a little village in stagnation. But, his discoveries in Luxor turned the tide of its misfortune. By 1869, when Thomas Cook brought his first group of tourists to Egypt, Luxor was already one of the highlights for tourists in Egypt. The town kept growing with number of tourists. Now it is a town of 500,000 people. It will cost you some $1,400 for a normal apartment as monthly rent if you decide to live there, along with some $300 in utility bills. That\u2019s 90% cheaper than NY, but hey, there is very little to do in Luxor apart from looking at \u201cworld\u2019s largest open air museum\u201d. Check out Georgina Lusby\u2019s answer to know more about living in Luxor today here.  Note: Quite a number of writers have proposed Damascus, Jericho or some other Levantine city to be the oldest. They may be older, but there is no evidence of their continuous inhabitation through history. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably Damascus in Syria. A city was clearly established there in the second millennium BC, and there\u2019s been a city there ever since. That said, it depends a bit on how you want to define your terms. The regions in which a number of cities exist have been inhabited for a long time, with permanent settlements rising and falling in those bounds over time. For example, the core of the city of Cairo (that is, the urban center which was originally named Cairo) only dates back to the tenth century. However, the region encompassed by the modern city of Cairo has continuously contained urban centers and suburban regions dating back many thousands of years. The modern city of Cairo has had cities on it since something like 3000 BC, but in the form of a number of different smaller cities over time. ",
