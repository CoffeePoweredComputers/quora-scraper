            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t make the first mistake. Play solid in the opening and not overly aggressive. Try to gain a small advantage in the middle game and wait for your opponent to create a weakness in his position. While waiting, make solid moves that do not weaken your pawn structure, centralize your pieces and bring them to strong controlling squares, and ensure your King is safe and well protected. Almost always, when your opponent faces this type of style, he will think you are weak and begin attacking you while weakening the pawns in front of his King and overall pawn structure (because most people hate a \u2018boring\u2019 chess game). By using this element of human psychology and exploiting the need for a dopamine-response in your opponent, he will start advancing his pieces and pawns. By now your pieces should be well placed. Start by finding the single weakness in his position (such as a weak pawn) and now start making very forceful moves. You are quickly changing your style from passive to aggressive which will catch your opponent off-guard. Make sure to practice lots of chess puzzles on LiChess.org, by signing up and clicking \u2018puzzles\u2019 and play 10\u201320 puzzles per day. When faced with your counter-attack, your opponent will often make a tactical error (such as a bad move which drops a pawn or a piece). This is the CRITICAL step.. once he blunders by making a bad move you MUST be able to recognize it and take advantage of it completely as you might only get 1 chance the entire game. As mentioned, if your chess tactics are sharp by constantly practicing chess puzzles you will find the correct move here. Now that you are up material (such as a pawn or piece), force a simplification/trade of pieces to reduce the chance you will make an error. Go back to the \u2018boring\u2019 yet strong and overly-conservative style of chess while minimalising all your potential errors by making sure your King and other pieces are very safe. Seek to make the position as simple as possible to reduce blunders. Now once the pieces are traded, you are up material, and you haven\u2019t made a mistake, go for the checkmate! ",

            "answer_text": "If chess was easy when you are matched against a similarly rated player then finding tricks, tactics and strategic moves which require serious thinking in order to refute or find replies would render the game quite boring as the basis for the game is knowing how to out fox your opponent. While playing online you have no way of knowing 100% that your opponent is sitting using a site that provides the moves which is the chance you take with this format. I have been playing on Zynga Chess with Friends and have played someone who told me they\u2019d been playing for a year and the quality of moves belied someone of much greater playing experience - you may never know if they are genuinely playing or if they are using a chess engine to provide the moves. Playing Blitz or any real-time form of chess you may also find this to be the case and only by serving a complaint to the site operator can you try to seek re-dress.  White\u2019s King side advance is opening the door to Black\u2019s Queen and an early termination of the game. ",
