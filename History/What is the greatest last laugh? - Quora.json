            "answer_text": "You must be knowing who this guy is  In case your parents had suprresed you under a mountain since your birth, this guy is Steves Jobs. Yeah, the Apple guy.  Well he had a very close friend, Wozniak. Literally, very close, you won\u2019t get it (no, he was hetro!). And he was a total geek and crazy about electronics stuff. He made this board and started to work on creating a well fuctioning software. Then, Jobs gave him the idea of starting a new company.  Yeah, Woz is actually the founder and Jobs is \u201cco-founder\u201d\u2026.. BUT techically Jobs found Apple! You better digest that! So back to the story, April 1976 \u2014 wait, is that first April?  Holy cow, that explains a lot. Well, anyways, they started the company in their dad\u2019s garage. They had the proper courage, talent, knowledge, determination and the motivation much needed. Fast forwarding to 1984 (cos that\u2019s the only point of this answer) when his company had flourished and appeared as a multi million dollar company, he got kicked out of his own DAMN company, Apple. John Sculley was the CEO at the time. And this guy was EXTREMELY jealous of Jobs\u2019s existence. They didn\u2019t even talked to each other, seriously. So Jobs started to convince top directors and executives of the company that Sculley must resign. However it seemed like the entire board was against him. They got biased towards Sculley. A few days later Sculley reorganized a meeting where Jobs got devoid of all the powers \u2014 he had no operational duties whatsover \u2014 he was only to remain chairman of the board. Steve was broken to atoms. Apple was his whole life. He got kicked out of his own company. Imagine that\u2026. Over NeXT years he didn\u2019t remain calm but founded two more companies consecutively and guess what \u2014 they both went successful. Former was NeXT and later Pixar (yes, he created that company too).  Fast forwarding his success again; Apple faced crisis on the release of Windows 95 whereas NeXT actually went a lot more successfull than expected till the extent that Apple had to buy that company (this was December 1996). Plus, Apple spend a whopping $400 millions to buy it. Jobs was back at the company he founded  The crisis went to the extent that in the first quater of 1997 Apple lost $700 million. The CEO got kicked off. Jobs was put in charge and he totally got rid of the old board. Savage comeback, sir. Moreover, in September he accepted to become Apple\u2019s interim CEO. He also appointed the executives he brought from NeXT. In just three years Jobs managed to bring back Apple to its status of cool tech icon.  Just adding this picture cos of the quote, iPod, therefore I am.   Source: Google Images Best example for the last lauph in my opinion. Vs ",

            "answer_text": " Ken Dodd has last laugh in smart tax move Ken Dodd, one of Britain\u2019s best known comedians sadly died last weekend. He will be remembered as one of the greatest variety performers. Before he died Ken may have had the last laugh at the expense of the tax man. Ken had not always had a happy relationship with HMRC. In 1989 he stood trial at Liverpool Crown Court on eight charges of tax fraud. HMRC alleged that the fraud had taken place over a 15 year period and involved \u00a3825,000. Apparently, \u00a3336,000 cash was hidden in wardrobes, cupboards and under stairs. In addition, it was stated he had a total of 20 bank accounts in Jersey and the Isle of Man where he would take \u201ccash and carry\u201d flights to deposit money the tax man knew nothing about. Ken was acquitted but faced a \u00a32 million bill for legal fees and tax he had owed.  Ken had been with his partner, Ann Jones, for forty years but they had never married. The rules surrounding inheritance mean that Ken could only leave \u00a3325,000 of his estate to her free of Inheritance Tax if they were unmarried at the date he died. However, they married shortly before the comedian\u2019s death so by tying the knot any money he left to Ann would be free of tax regardless of the amount. So for example, if Ken had left his estate valued at \u00a32 million to Ann and died before they married, \u00a3670,000 Inheritance Tax would have been payable. Following their marriage no tax would be payable. Although Ken\u2019s motive for getting married was no doubt the love and affection he felt for Ann the reduction in the amount of Inheritance Tax now payable on his estate may have brought a smile to his face.
