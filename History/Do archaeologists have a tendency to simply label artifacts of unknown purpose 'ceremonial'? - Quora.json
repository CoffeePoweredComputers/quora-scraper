            "answer_text": "Yes and no. You throw up a few questions - what exactly makes a ritual or ceremonial object, and is that a valid interpretation? And why does so much archaeological news seem to consist of these objects? I\u2019ll try to address both. Calling something \u2018ritual\u2019 is a sort of a joke amongst archaeologists. It\u2019s a quick way of describing a behaviour, feature or object that can\u2019t be easily given a functional explanation. Archaeology, particularly prehistory, is rife with \u2018ritual\u2019 phenomena and is not limited to \u2018mysterious\u2019 objects or monumental structures. Ditches comprising enclosures or field systems, structural foundations like post-holes or beam slots, walls, wells and storage pits are all pretty understandable features; they serve a purpose we can understand. Ceramic pots, metal brooches, coins and butchered animal bones are all similarly functional in nature. Finding large broken sherds of pot and animal bones in the bottom of a pit is an example of finding a functional behaviour. We can interpret the deposition of these artefacts as being the primary discard of rubbish - pots that have broken, butchered bones, thrown into a pit to be gotten rid of.  An Iron Age loom weight, recycled from a broken pot base. But finding a complete, unbroken pot in a pit or at the bottom of a ditch, or a complete animal grave of a cow or pig, could be examples of ritual deposition, because there\u2019s no functional reason you\u2019d want to do that, at least to our modern-day minds and sensibilities.  Teracotta votive bodyparts.  A votive amphora from sussex. Deposition of votive offerings is a practice found across the world throughout history. The Romans deposited miniature objects and curse tablets (rolled-up lead inscriptions) into sacred springs, wells and pits. The vikings cast \u2018ritually killed\u2019 swords into bogs. Prehistoric people were buried with grave goods including food, jewellery and other objects.  A reconstruction of the Amesbury Archer grave. There are objects and practices which are unambigiously ritual. Structures like Stonehenge, the Pyramids and causewayed enclosures are all held up as ritual monuments, because they serve no functional purpose such as for shelter or storage. It is a matter of semantics whether you consider the feasting and celebration that occurred at places like Stonehenge to be important functional requirements for prehistoric societies. One of the great debates in archaeology is whether past people were rational. This just means they reacted in rational ways to their environment and always took the best-fit solution to problems such as how to expend their labour or build their settlements. We\u2019ve largely moved past this simplistic, purely processual view, and tend to understand that if people don\u2019t always act in the most rational way today, there\u2019s no reason they would back then. Just because we don\u2019t see a \u2018logical\u2019 interpretation for something we find, doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not valid. A wise piece of advice I was given when I first entered archaeology was \u2018Don\u2019t seek to fathom the wisdom of the ancients\u2019 - strange given that\u2019s all archaeologists try to do, but it just means that because something doesn\u2019t make \u2018sense\u2019, doesn\u2019t mean that isn\u2019t what it is. When I\u2019ve found things like a square pit lined with re-used Roman roof tiles and filled with rubble and bone gaming tokens, I think \u2018Don\u2019t seek to fathom the wisdom of the ancients\u2019. On to the second question - why is such a big deal made of ritual objects and sites? Why are they the big-ticket items that make the news? The simple answer is that they\u2019re sexy. They are, by-and-large, what the general public wants to read about, so that\u2019s what the news caters to. They may be three hundred archaeological sites being excavated in the UK on any day of the week. Some of them will find things that are interesting.. to other archaeologists. Occasionally they find things that are interesting to non-archaeologists.  An Anglo-Saxon plank-lined grave in the news recently. Remains of this sort and level of preservation are very rare. A big deal was made out of one of the coffins on this site being a hollowed-out tree trunk. Do you think that is a ritual behaviour? These sites tend to be photogenic, involve mosaics or human remains, and the people that find them have strong media instincts. The more remote something is from our present-day understanding or way of life, the more \u2018mysterious\u2019 an object is.. well.. the better news it makes. ",
