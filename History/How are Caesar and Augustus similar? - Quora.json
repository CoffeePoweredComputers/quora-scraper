            "answer_text": "They were both major Roman leaders of the first century BCE.  They came (at least nominally) from the same family, Iulii Caesares, so they shared a name.  They both had complete control of Rome (Caesar only briefly).  They were both brilliant (although in different ways).  They were both holders of the chief priesthood, pontifex maximus,  as well as a number of other dignities, such as consul multiple times, etc. They both commanded large armies (although Augustus only nominally most of the time). Apparently, both were generous and well-regarded by most commoners. Both were deified after death. ",
