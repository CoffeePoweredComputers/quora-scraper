            "answer_text": "Ironically, relatively little. See, a good deal of the nobility got out of France before things got really bad. The majority of nobles who stayed were of the liberal nobility. Now, practically all of these nobles were arrested following the Law of Suspects, which was the beginning of the Terror. However, not all of these were executed as the Terror was run according to pre-industrial technology. Hilariously, in a dark sort of way, of the 35,000\u201345,000 people killed in the Terror, 85% were of the Third Estate, according to Georges Lefebvre. This is still a disproportionately high amount of nobles, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the Terror was ultimately less a class genocide and more a general suppression of dissent or as Robespierre termed it a purification of French virtue.

            "answer_text": "Over approximately 300 000 nobles, 18 000-19 000 were killed which is around 6% of the whole noble population, which isn't a lot compared to the rest of the other social classes (most nobles fled to Switzerland or hid during the massacres). What really massacred the French nobility was the 1st world war where 20-25% of nobles were killed due to the fact that the French army used to be a monarchist nest in the French society. ",
