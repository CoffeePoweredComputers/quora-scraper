            "answer_text": "I'm not an expert and this is just what I remember from history class but I'm pretty sure it's because of the bad planning of the English and the rebellion of the Irish. Let me explain. I'm not sure about the Normans but a one tactic that was used multiple times by the English were plantations. This was when they would take the land from the Irish Catholics and give it to English Protestants in an attempt to make Ireland more English, however not many people really wanted to go over at the time. Among the many rules that the English had to follow when receiving land in Ireland, was the rule that no Irish Catholics were to work on the land they were given. This rule in particular caused a lot of problems, as there was not enough English workers to work the land. In the end this rule was ignored as the land owners needed more people to do labor for them. Another problem with these plantations was their size. Because they were so large it was very hard to protect all of the land and Irish clans would often raid the lands and attack the English. Sometimes they would take valuables in exchange for the promise that they would leave the English alone and then attack them anyway. This frightened a lot of English into leaving. Although a lot of plantations failed not all of them did. The Ulster plantation was somewhat successful. Learning from previous failures the size of the land was reduced, special stone houses were built for protection and new towns were built. Eventually, over the centuries, a large population in Ulster had become Protestant and this would in turn become the reason why it was Ulster and not any other part of Ireland that stayed as part of England. While this was going on, laws called penal laws were also introduced. These laws were meant to punish Catholics in hopes that they would convert to Protestantism. These laws caused a lot of dissatisfaction in the Catholics which eventually lead to many rebellions against the English. A major rebellion was the 1916 Easter Rising which later went on to inspire the rebellion that led to the independence of Ireland. All of the plantations that failed and all of the rebellions that had to be fought back caused a lot of difficulties to the English and certainly cost a lot as well. Not sure if this is what you're looking for but I did the best I could. Again this may not be 100% accurate as this is just what I remember from history class and there are definitely a lot more details to this that I do not remember. ",

            "answer_text": "Ireland, outside the area round Dublin (called \u2018The Pale) was, like northern Scotland and much of Wales, a fairly wild place that was not \u2018conquered\u2019 or really incorporated into any kingdom until sometime after 1700. Just to point out that \u2018England\u2019 never conquered Ireland in any way. It is great that you specify the Normans earlier (although later they came to be called the Old English in Ireland). Elizabeth claimed to be Queen of Ireland and a few English soldiers were sent to Ireland to fight various recalcitrant local war-lords (Desmond, Tyrone, Tyconnel, etc), some staying, some returning. James 1 put loads of Scots in the North but the maximum number of English was 2,200 (men), most forced to go the kings Londonderry project and there is good evidence that the vast majority returned as soon as they could. Cromwell\u2019s army was largely English but also had a lot of Irish protestants. It did defeat, the mostly Irish, Catholic armies in Ireland but the English soldiers did not remain there any more than they remained in Scotland when the war came to an end there. The army that beat James II was headed by a General called Godert de Ginkel reporting to his Dutch boss, Willem of Orange. It did have some English amongst the Irish, Scots and Dutch soldiers. Ireland remained and independent kingdon until 1900/01 when by a vote on both the Irish and British parliaments they were merged to form the United Kingdom. The later split of Ireland from the UK was held up by decades by the unwillingness of many of those living in Ireland to be ruled from Dublin, not British or English reluctance - although there was that as well.
