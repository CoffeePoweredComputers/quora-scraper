            "answer_text": "To have children outside of marriage. (Not including Adoptions). This is Intentionally getting Pregnant Without the Benefit of Marriage/Husband and Legal Father for the Child that is born. This is Very Destabilizing for a society in that the Family Unit is Destroyed. Women decide to marry Mr. Government instead. Then, The Men who Are the Biological Fathers are Displaced/\u2018Thrown Out\u2019 (as it were). Children (especially male children), are \u2018semi-raised\u2019 right into the government\u2019s criminal system. Without strong, male adult guidance, the child grows into a barbarian-ruthless, caring Only for his Own needs. Going into making\u2019fast\u2019 money (drugs/stealing/murder, etc.)for all the \u2018glitter and glam\u2019 that he \u2018thinks\u2019 makes him a \u2018real man\u2019. This behavior then spreads out like a cancer to destabilize communities, cities, and then the country. The female children are left to \u2018mimic mommy\u2019. Not finishing school, because of teenage pregnancy. She is left to \u2018follow in mommy\u2019s footsteps\u2019: Marry Mr. Government. Where she is plied with her monthly government check (for herself and her \u2018illegitimate\u2019 child\u2019). She takes this check out of the sweat/work of taxpayers who pay into this Huge scam for hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Year after year, with absolutely No thought for a Better future for herself and the \u2018children\u2019 (from many fathers) she bears. Low rent housing where crime is rampant. Drug and alcohol use, prostitution is common. And women are denigrated to that of \u2018breeders\u2019 in the eyes of many people. No church/spiritual guidance forms the backbone of these women\u2019s lives. No structure forms their days. And they are Easily brainwashed into Believing that a mythical \u2018racism\u2019 walls up their lives. When it is their Beliefs and Behavior that form the troubled roots of their lives. The unwillingness and strength to look in the mirror and blame Themselves for their lot in Life. And the Lack of Inner Strength to Change their lives (and their children\u2019s lives), for a Better Future. ",

            "answer_text": "Women having sex before marriage. It is very normal now, but for thousands of years in the past it was a taboo. In most antient high cultures and in Europe and many other developed countries up to the middle of the 20th century women were not allowed to have sex before marriage. And any woman who broke this strict rule had a choice to either try to hide this fact from everyone, even her closest friends and family, to ensure nobody ever found that out or (expecially if the premarital sex produced a child and there was no way to hide it anymore) to face open condemnation and even exclusion from their family and community, such a woman could never hope to marry within her social group and was treated very poorly even by her family her whole life. The actual practical reason for this stance in society was that property could only belong to men and passed exclusively through the male line, and forbidding women to have sex with anyone but their husbands was the only way people knew to ensure that any children they produced would be undoubtedly their husbands\u2019 and could inherit their property. Men having sex before marriage also wasn\u2019t viewed favourably, but most men, especially those with high social standing, had sex before marriage and the society didn\u2019t openly condemn it as it was the case with women guilty of the same sin. Men could have premarital sex with prostitutes as well as their slaves and servants (who came from lower social classes and were in a very dependant position either being serfs in the middle ages who had to obey their masters whatever they demanded or needing a job to feed themselves and their family so badly they had to put up with anything). Many of those sex encounters would be called rape today, but for many centuries powerful men could rape any woman from a lower social class and never had to suffer any consequences for this crime. Now you understand where the Women\u2019s Rights\u2019 Movement is coming from. ",
