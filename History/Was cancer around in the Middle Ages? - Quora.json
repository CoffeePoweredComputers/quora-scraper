            "answer_text": "Yes, and it was invariably fatal unless it could be surgically operated. Some forms of cancer (like lung cancer) which are common today, were rare in the Middle Ages; some, which are less common today (like skin cancer) were much more common in the Middle Ages. The name \u201ccancer\u201d is Latin and means \u201ccrab\u201d. Greek medic Hippocrates was the first to describe it. He described the tumours with the increased vascularization to resemble crabs within the endocrine. He used the Greek word \u201ckarkinos\u201d, from which the name \u201ccarcinoma\u201d is derived, for a malignant tumour. In many languages cancer is called with the corresponding name of crab, such as Swedish kr\u00e4ftan, German Krebs or Estonian v\u00e4hk. The Finnish word sy\u00f6p\u00e4 (\u201cconsumer\u201d, \u201ceater\u201d or \u201cdevourer\u201d) is very old, and describes the way cancer consumes the patient away. The only remedies available were surgery and birchwood ash. It actually may be helpful: it is highly alkalic, and contains a high proportion of potash. Potash is known to destroy tumours. ",
