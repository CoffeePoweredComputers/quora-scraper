            "answer_text": "To Michael McKean\u2019s excellent answer, some additional detail may be of interest. The Vikings, as popularly defined since the 18th century as Scandinavian sea raiders, conducted indiscriminate raids in the British Isles and in Northern Europe for about a hundred years, dating from the infamous Lindisfarne raid in 793 to the early 900s. That time-frame, motivated primarily by plunder, is the piratical phase of the so-called Viking Age and characterizes what we usually think of when we think of bloodthirsty plunderers, murderers and slavers. After that, Norse colonial expansion occurred, not unlike what the Europeans would do in the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries. Can these Norse invasions that resulted in large settlements, towns, farms and the spread of Norse peoples be classified properly as \u201cViking\u201d? Scholars are not in complete agreement on this. If we are as generous with the term \u201cViking,\u201d as many would like to be, and apply it to all the Norse Conquests as well as the period of piracy, then it\u2019s accurate to include the Norman invasion of Britain in 1066 with those Norse Conquests since the Normans were primarily of Scandinavian origin and their name \u201cNorman,\u201d meant \u201cNorth men.\u201d William the Conqueror was directly descended from the famed and feared Rollo (depicted in fine form in the recent Vikings series). So while the Battle of Hastings in 1066 was between Normans and Anglo Saxons, much of the rest of the conquest of Britain was basically a Norse civil conflict. Below is a map of the \u201cViking\u201d conquests up to the reign of the Danish King Cnut in 1028.  Following the Norman Conquest of Britain, other Normans, feeling restless and aggressive, and being possibly the greatest fighting force in the world\u2014basically Vikings on horseback\u2014conquered Sicily, parts of Southern Italy and eventually spearheaded the First Crusade in the Middle East, establishing a principality in Antioch that lasted until 1254. The map below shows the Norse expansion through 1130.  The last recorded battle involving Norse attackers and locals occurred in 1263 in the Hebrides of Scotland, where the outer islands had been in dispute for some time. The victors spoils went to the Scots, thanks to a tempest that destroyed the Norwegian fleet. Some would like to argue that the Viking/Norse Age is ongoing, given the expansion of the English and Spanish into the New World of the Americas, but that\u2019s a little harder sell than the Normans may be. The influence of the Norse cultures is, however, undeniable. Maps and other material for this answer come from a variety of sources, but do check on 13 Centuries of the Nordic Peoples and a webpage called Viking Attacks. ",

            "answer_text": "Thats extremely controversial among scholars. I\u2019m going to take the liberty of interpreting Viking as \u201cpirate\u201d (vs. Norse, which could be any inhabitant of Scandinavia). Before the Norse began raiding, they were already trading. In fact, the monks at Lindisfarne \u2014 one of the first recorded raids \u2014 thought the Vikings were coming ashore to trade. That\u2019s how commonly the Norse were seen as traders (and not raiders). Many modern day historians seem to lean towards the idea that the Viking raids were spurred on by greed. Swimming against the tide, I disagree. I tend to think their raids were initially triggered by economic desperation, but then turned into an industry later on. Meaning they got good at raiding, liked the wealth and kept doing it when they no longer had to. The Norse had lots of great skills and resources that they fully exploited to make sure that their raids were succcessful. Technical skills - like the other poster noted - in woodworking, shipbuilding, iron forging, and navigation played a crucial role. Their lightning raids reduced the likelihood they would get hurt. Theatrics like impaling babies on swords \u2014 designed to shock and terrorize their victims \u2014 made their legend grow. This, in turn, made their victims less apt to resist, which in turn lowered the risk the Vikings would get killed. I suspect the Vikings did lots of strategic planning in those long cold Norse winters before they ever launched their first raid. They made good use of all that time indoors by the fire. ",

They became dairy farmers and as the land was difficult they never developed a feudal system but relied on a clan system and fought each other. One particularly cold winter they were forced to trade and raid and found by then life in the cold north had made them tough and they made a fortune going through Russia and down to Constantinople where they were seen as red necks, only the trip was awful and dangerous. Eventually they took over Kiev and united areas of Russia. Then they made a fortune invading to the west, England and France and this at least at first was easier. They stuck close to the coasts and did short quick raids not armed battles. Eventually they took over part of both England and France. They stayed where ever the land was better than at home and eventually intermarried. ",

            "answer_text": "The Viking Age took place between the Fimbul Winter and the Medieval Warm Period. And it was the last phase of the Nordic Battle Axe and Boat Culture, which started 1.600BC. With trading of amber, fur and slaves bringing back copper from Greece and tin from Cornwall. In the Iron Age climate got colder, and over time Germanic tribes left Scandinavia for Germania and Roman lands. And some brought back Roman coins and the Runic alphabet. When Scandinavian mixed farming collapsed 536\u2013540CE, Angles and Saxons left and the Norse moved in over Jutland. They formed a strong Odin cult and rebuilt farming to maximum until 800CE. Though only the oldest son inherited land, so the other sons would have to go elsewhere. The ones who went East along rivers were called Varangians, and those who went to the West via the North Sea were Vikings. When Charlemagne and the Anglian mission christianised and beheaded continental Saxons by Hedeby, the Norse started raiding Anglian and Frankish monasteries. The term Viking was born, and some of them became Norman crusaders. Iceland, Faeroe islands, Shetland and other places were settled, and there was slave trading around Dublin. When climate got warmer and the ploughs got better, the christianised Norse could develop farming at home, and they turned to crusading Finland and the Baltics instead. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, they weren\u2019t really a new thing. You see, people had been migrating from Scandinavia to greener pastures for centuries before that, mostly for the same reasons that the Vikings went on their journeys. Why?   A significant amount of Norway and Sweden look like this. Where do you want to put a wheat field? In a time when a region\u2019s wealth mostly depended on it\u2019s fertility, Scandinavia was one of the hardest places in the world to cultivate crops. This meant that it was one of the poorest places, with little time for figuring out technological innovations (except of course for shipbuilding, but I\u2019ll get to that later) Most Norsemen in the Viking Age were farmers desperately trying to get some food out of their limited lands, but usually without much luck. Usually, the men of the family would also go fishing. You know how the North Sea looks during a storm?  And do you know how Scandinavian fishing boats looked?  You can imagine that this was a rather dangerous endeavor. Perhaps so dangerous, that it wasn\u2019t much more of a risk to sail to England and raid a few villages? So when your local chieftain, king or jarl gathers your community together and asks you to go on a raid for him, while your crops are growing (he promises that you\u2019ll be back to harvest them in time), what do you do? Well, you: pick up the axe you\u2019re already using to chop wood (axes were the most common weapon for Vikings)jump in the clinker built (a very advanced Norse innovation necessary for sailing the North Sea) ship you\u2019re already using to fish or tradePlunder a couple of villages along with your matesBring home some English silver to purchase foods, new jewelry for a better social status and even a few slaves to work your fields instead of your wife and kidsSounds like an appealing offer wouldn\u2019t you say? This is incidentally also why many Vikings ultimately decided to just stay in the Danelaw or Normandy, where the land was more fertile. After all, they were just farmers and fishermen trying to make a living. Edit: one should also keep in mind the culture of the Norsemen, which appreciated manly traits like skill and courage in battle and stigmatized negative traits like cowardice Hope this helped :)) ",

So I take it short\u2026 From the Bronze age and on people in Scandinavia has moved elsewhere when things hasn\u2019t gone their way. Overpopulation is the major reasons why the Goths, Heruls, Vandals, etc. left in the 1\u20132st century and famine why the Anglo-Saxons/Scandinavians in the 4\u20136thcentury populated Britain, and overpopulation again in Viking era. Note the periods of 300 years between. The south of Scandinavia is a really frugal country which has been farmed for 5000 years, but it is divided by forests and sea and the lands can only provide for a certain amount of people. From around 600\u20131350 AD there was a warm climate period and the population in Scandinavia grew more then it had ever done before. The lands could no longer be divided among all siblings as is the Nordic custom. The land didn\u2019t provide enough. The followers of Rollo in Normandie told stories about the how the eldest sons lost heritage and had to provide for themselfs. The oldest sons of Tancred de Hauteville got the same treatment in the late 10th century and invaded Sicily\u2026 This is why there suddenly was so many unemployed young men looking for fame and fortune and not being occupied with farming. This is also why they settled and didn\u2019t just took what they wanted and went home. At the end of the Viking era the plow was introduced in Scandinavia and the lands could suddenly provide more from less areal. Kings and Christianity took power and people was commanded to colonize Finland, Norrland instead. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the Rus and the Turks were allies against the Hunnic invasions. Arabic sources: the Mujmal al-Tawarikh calls Khazars and Rus' \"brothers\"; later, Muhammad al-Idrisi, Al-Qazwini, and Ibn Khaldun all identified the Rus' as a sub-group of the Turks. Perhaps they could be part of an empire. It could be because the Turks have had 16 different empires around the area. They had a Hunnic Empire in Asia from 220 BC going through phases to the \u2018White Hunnic Empire\u2019 which lasted up til the 8th century. In old Germanic oral tradition Huns appear as a contemporary tribe to that of Vikings and as a natural enemy of the latter. For example, in the Hl\u00f6\u00f0skvi\u00f0a or The Battle of the Goths and Huns (13th century). So, if the Rus must pay some tribute -I\u2019m not sure if there were part of an actual empire or no-, but they don\u2019t have the riches themselves or they won\u2019t give of their own men and women, they would set sail to find that somewhere else, either through robbery, piracy, kidnapping.. The chosen ones would often be at the service of a lord who perhaps promised them great riches for their feat. ",
