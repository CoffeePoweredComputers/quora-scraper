            "answer_text": "Ashwasena (\u0905\u0936\u094d\u200d\u0935\u0938\u0947\u0928) was son of Naga Takshaka, whose mother Arjuna had slain. He was saved by Indra, while Khandavavana was put into flame by Pandavas. Once, when Krishna and Arjuna were staying on the banks of the Yamuna in summer, Agni requested them to help him consume the Khandava forest. Arjuna agreed to help him, and Agni gave him the Gandiva, a white horse and several divine weapons. When Agni started consuming the forest, it began raining, at Indra\u2019s command. Arjuna made a layer of arrows to block the rain. Ashwasena tried to escape but was blocked by Arjuna\u2019s arrow. Ashwasena\u2019s mother swallowed him and helped him escape the fire, but Arjuna\u2019s arrrow beheaded her. Indra then tried to save Ashwasena by sending a fresh burst of wind and rains. Arjuna fell unconscious in that onslaught and Ashwasena managed to escape. During the Mahabharata war, when Arjuna fought Karna, the Naga King Ashwasena desirous of avenging the death of his mother from Arjuna, in that battle quietly slips into the quiver of Karna in the guise of an Arrow. It is this Arrow that had almost killed Arjuna had it not been for Krishna who by pressing his feet on the chariot sank it one cubit deep into the earth hence the arrow missing its aim. Ashwasena | Origins Ashwasena - Jatland Wiki But, the Astra that Karna was shooting at Arjuna was a Nagastra and Ashwasena was at the tip of the weapon. Whether Ashwasena was on the tip or not, the celestial weapon would have destroyed Arjuna. This was why Krishna deliberately sunk the chariot into the ground - to save Arjuna from The Nagastra and not from Ashwasena. ",
