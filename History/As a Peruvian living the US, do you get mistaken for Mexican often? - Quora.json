As an American born Peruvian with Indian and Spanish ancestry, I am most frequently mistaken for Filipino although people who have visited Peru do not seem to make that mistake and guess correctly that my ancestry is from some South American country. Since Peru has had successive waves of immigration for over 100 years, some Peruvians are African, Asian and European in features. Those Peruvians are respectively mistaken for their regional ancestral background, but are very Peruvian in language and culture. There are some rural parts of the US that have very little exposure to the world. In those cases, yes, I have very frequently been mistaken for Mexican. ",
