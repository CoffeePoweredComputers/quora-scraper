Traitors in the Shadows. 2>The Last Mughal, The Fall of a Dynasty, Delhi 1857 is a 2006 historical book by William Dalrymple. Details: For a Normal Reader Interested to Know Mughal Empire , i would Highly Recommend Alex Rutherford Series...The Empire of Mughal...this is the Most Fascinating Stuff i have read on Mughals & you would be stuck with books until you read them all...Once you pick them..it ie very difficult to Stop Completing the Whole Series.. Insight : Empire of the Moghul The epic story of the rise and fall of one of the most powerful and opulent dynasties in history. Alex Rutherford has Written his work in Six Volumes...Covering Start of Mughal Empire to Pinnacle of Mughal Empire in India...Each Dedicated to a King...So it starts from : 1>Book1: Raiders from the north: This is About Life of Babur(Babur) who laid the foundation on Mughal Empire in India from a Prince of Ferghana in present Uzbekistan.This has references to Biography of Babur work - Baburnama. Written by his Sister - Khanzada & this certainly is most fascinating..thrilling & inspriing stories you have ever read... How Babur from a being mere raiders (After he lost this throne from fergana to his cousin) on plains of Central Asia with a less army defeated greater Army of Ibrahim Lodhi of Lodhi Dyanasty with help of his friend Baburi & Carved Out one of Power Dynasty in History - The Mughals , Empire None less than that of Persians whose Shah once Mocked Babur on his lands. 2>Book2: Brothers at War: This is About Life of Humayun(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu...) , Second of Mughal King, Son of Babur...Again Many references from his Biography ...Himayunama...He was kind of Mystic Kings who was interested in astronomy ..looking at starts & moon to predict about his life & kingdome..he was absorbed in opium & wine until Babur sister Khanzada rained upon her to preserve mughal dynasty for which Babur spent his life .His Kingship went in doldrums when Sher Shah Suri..a General from Bengal defeated him & Himayun was again pushed back to peshawar...a short period of time...after death of Sher Shah Suri in an Accident ...Himayon once again captured Delhi Sultante with help of persians logitics & Mughal Dyanasty Continued. 3>Book3: Ruler of the World : This is About Life of Akbar(Akbar), third of Mughal King..Son of Himayun..He is Known as best Mughal Ruler because he gave space to many religion in his court...Priest from Different religion would come to his courts & he was interested to know about all religions..he married a Rajput princess to make a deep bonding with native rules like Rajputs..Nawabs..Rajas those who have declares Mughals as there overlord.Akbar Tried to Create his own religion Din-e Ilahi & professed same in his kingdom. Akbar had grand Monument created for his father Himayon(Humayun's Tomb) ..still present in present delhi. 4>Book4: Tainted throne: This is About life of Salim...Better known as Jahangir (Conqueror of World - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja...) & famous for tale of his illicit relationship with the Mughal courtesan, Anarkali. In The end of his life it is know that her wife https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu... wielded much power in Dyansty using Jahangir favorable understanding towards her. 5>Books5 :The Serpent's Tooth: This about Life of Khurram...better known as Shah_Jahan(Ruler of the world - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh...). He is Known for his Affection for Mumtaj & then creating one of world Wonder & Symbol of Love - The Taj Mahal (a Tomb for her Wife Mumtaj). Mughals Successfully Ruled for Five Generations having Common practice of Alliances with Local Hindu Kings...Rajput Generals in Mughal Army...Inter Religious Marriages...Interfaith Relationships in Mughal Court...freedom of Religious Expression but that changed drastically With Sixth Generation Ruler - Aurangzeb & Sixth book is About him . 6>Book6 : Traitors in the Shadows: This Book Cover's Reign of Aurangzeb. He came to power After Imprisoning his Father (Jahaghir) & killing his Brother - Dara.He was Fanatical & has different views on other Religion Except islam. One of Main Reasons attributes to this physcology was the mentor ship of Distorted Mullahs who reasoned Aurangzeb to think that his mother - Mumtaz died early since people are not following Islam practices in Kingdom & god has laid wrath on Mughals. As Soon as he Acceded to power ..there was no freedom to native religions...he insulted rajputs generals which formed backbone of Mughal army in Subcontinent...Started Conquest in South Against Marathas...Annexed lands from Hindu Rulers which were earlier kept as Vassals in Mughal Dynasty.At this Point of time due to ruthlessness & Conquests Mughal Dynasty was in Peak Power But due to his Policies against natives...it started downfall of Mughal Empire & slow Disintegration started after his death. -------------------------------------------------------------------Seventh Book - The Last Mughal by William Dalrymple After Reading this Series ...you would like to know then how Mughal Dynasty Finally ended...Well for that you have to read one more interesting work of Renowned Historian William Dalrymple - The Last Mughal(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th...) . I would highly recommend this book as it reflects upon Mindseht of last Mughal Ruler - Bahadur Shah Zafar at time where power of Mughals were limited to Red Fort at Delhi.Bahadur Shah Zafar was not a type of Marshal prowess as earlier mughals were...he has more poets & artist at his courts than any other...it was time of famous poets - Zauq & Ghalib...Bahadur Shah Zafar was himself a good poet.In Revolt of 1857..the Mutineers from Meerut Cantoment after pushing English from Delhi declared Bahadur shah Zafar as Natural King of Subcontinent & massacred many Englishmen on streets...when English Came back with greater force ...they killed Prince, Sons of Bahadur Shah Zafar outside Tomb of Himayon & deported Bahadur Shah Zafar to Rangoon Therefore Bringing the end of Mughal Dynasity in India. Summary: Alex Rutherford(Empire of Moghuls) may not be very Scholarly but it gives a great insight with Interesting narration that you will find hard to put book down..i bought the whole bunch from flip-kart & i remember completing within week...it was like a roller coaster ride :)Nobody can Comment on Writings of William Dalrymple...Most Simply i can say you can pick any book of him blindly...He is Master of Narrating Stories & Actually relating it back to Historical empirical Evidence in Biblography...A Scholars delight Must Say :) I tried to write summary of all books so that it generates little kind of Interest...which is most important before picking any book..Hope that helps.
