            "answer_text": "Maybe it\u2019s better to talk about what role Yakuza did not play in WW2. Most historians claim that many rich people of post war Japan made their fortunes by trading in black market. Even Soviet politburo and their close friend -businessmen were ready for post Soviet era before Soviets collapsed....They became capitalists overnight. Well, what about Yakuza? Who controlled the black market in Japan during WW2? Who were the people bought land from poor and hungry Japanese for food and even for bags of rice? I think during WW2 Yakuza already invested for post war Japan. \u2018\u2019 Black market has a strong connection with the Japanese underworld and this generally has been considered to be \u201coff limits\u201d to the scholarly community. The yakuza have been known to threaten anyone, even foreigners, who publish books or articles that are critical of the Japanese underworld. In 2009, Jake Adelstein published a book entitled, Tokyo Vice: An American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan. He soon received death threats from yakuza who were not pleased with his attitude about organized crime in Japan.\u2019\u2019 Source of the selected quote: https://scholar.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi article=1012&context=hist_gradetds \u2018\u2019 On July 18, 1946, The New York Times published an article stating that Army fiscal offices had \u201ctransferred to the United States $35,000,000 more than the entire occupation [had] been paid.\u201d GHQ quickly discovered that U.S. soldiers were actively involved in selling American goods on the black market and sending their profits home. Although SCAP implemented a number of policies to discourage U.S. soldiers from illegally selling American goods, these policies failed to eliminate black marketeering during the Occupation of Japan (1945-1952)\u2019\u2019 Source: https://scholar.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=hist_gradetds Even after the war \u2018\u2019 SCAP failed to crack down aggressively on the organized crime syndicates that ran the black markets in Japan. Second, a black market culture had developed throughout Japan and the high demand for American goods coupled with the GI\u2019s willingness to sell these goods to Japanese civilians made it difficult for SCAP to stop black marketeering. \u2018\u2019 Source: https://scholar.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=hist_gradetds Original source of the article below: Tokyo \"Black Markets\", 1945. Tokyo \u201cBlack Markets\u201d, 1945.  Ueno Hirokoji black market, c. 1945, looking north toward Ueno Park (top) and Ueno Station (top-right). \u201cThis is Tokyo\u2019s Ueno, the most pugnacious part of town, where tempers and nostrils flare, and every inch of territory \u2013 even the space under a train trestle \u2013 is guarded jealously. Yes, it is just the sort of place where, not so very long ago, there was a bloody row in which the locals took on the gendarmes of the law. \u201cIt is also what comes in the wake of war and its fire: a city in ruins, the burnt-out shell of a metropolis. Its creatures have hatched out of the debris, and now they survive by the sheer tenacity with which they came in to the world and by which they cling to life. \u201c\u2026 For the denizens of the marketplace are as ready as eer to reach into the crowd and sink their teeth into a potential customer. Indeed they have so devised the business of selling food that they need only to rattle a plate to make the cheapest yen notes fly forth from someone\u2019s tired pocket. It is like a trap or a clever springlike device in which the clatter of dishes sets up a hollow sound that echoes all the way down to the pit of the empty stomach of every customer and makes him or her want to eat.\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe Jesus of the Ruins\u201d, Ishikawa Jun, 1946  Tokyo residents line up at curbside yami ichi (black markets) at Ginza Crossing, c. late 1945 at the onset of the Occupation. Looking northwest toward Kyobashi, with the Dai-ichi Sogo building in the distance, the Wako department store is at left, and would be repaired for use as the Tokyo PX by Occupation forces; the burned-out shell of the Mitsukoshi Ginza department store is to the right. The Ginza retail and commercial district had been firebombed in a May 1945 raid by American B-29 bombers. \u201cJapan lay prostrate. Industrial output [in 1945] had fallen to mere 10 per cent of the prewar level, and as late as 1946, more than 13 million remained unemployed. Nearly 40 per cent of Japan\u2019s urban areas had been turned to rubble, and some 9 million people were homeless. \u201c\u2026 Shantytowns built of scrap wood, rusted metal and scavenged odss and ends sprang up everywhere, resembling junk yards. The poorest searched smouldering refuse heaps for castoff items that might somehow be bartered for a scrap to eat or something to wear. \u201cBlack markets (yami\u2019ichi, lit. \u2018dark market\u2019) run by Japanese, Koreans and Formosans mushroomed to replace collapse distribution channels and cash in on inflated prices. Tokyo became \u2018a world of scarcity in which every nail, every rag, and even atangerine peel [had a] market value.\u2019 \u201cBlack market yami goods fetched prices more than 30 times higher than those for officially controlled commodities. Such markets also were awash with food stores, clothing and industrial equipment pilfered from military stockpiles by corrupt industrialists, bureaucrats and former military officers, whose illegal activities made black marketeering a low-risk, high-growth industry.\u201d \u2013 Inside GHQ: The Allied Occupation of Japan and Its Legacy, by Takemae Eiji, 2002  Nichigeki Theater customers (left) & Sukiyabashi black market crowds lining the street toward Ginza in the distance, 1945. \u2018\u2019 Urgent notice to enterprises, factories and those manufacturers in the process of shifting from wartime production to peacetime production. Your product will be bought in large quantities at a suitable price. Those who wish to sell should come with samples and estimates of production cost to the following address: Shinjuku Market, 1-8-54, Tsunohazu,Yodobashiku, Shinjuku Tokyo. Kanto Ozu GumiAugust 18, 1945 \u2018\u2019 \u201cIt was surely some kind of record for speed. Three days after the end of the war\u2014and a full ten before the first American soldier set foot in Japan\u2014the above newspaper advertisement appeared for what would be the nation\u2019s first postwar black market. One of the very few paid announcements in print at the time, it was a call to commerce hardly anyone expected so quickly, given the wretched, bomb-ravaged condition of Tokyo. \u201cFor most of Tokyo\u2019s inhabitants existence was a living hell. Homeless, numbering in the millions, lived in jerry-built huts of chicken wire, rocks, and cardboard, occupied subway stations and air raid shelters, or camped out in large bomb craters in the street. There was so little available food that people would travel hours to the countryside to trade expensive heirlooms for a tiny share of a farmer\u2019s crop. Yet, by August 20, only five days after Japan had officially conceded defeat, the Ozu open-air market was ready to roll. \u201cLocated at the main entrance of the western commuter hub Shinjuku Station\u2014or what was left of it\u2014it boasted a startling array of goods. Displayed on wooden crates were pots, pans, kettles, plates, silverware, cooking oil, tea, rice, leather, electrical goods and geta (wooden clogs), along with vast quantities of military equipment and clothing. Most of the wares for the market, which bore the romantic-sounding name Hikari Wa Shinjuku Yori (The Light Shines forth from Shinjuku), had been stolen from a secret supply of provisions for a ghost army of 4 million men that was to have been mobilized in the event of an American invasion of the mainland. \u201cThe outdoor black markets were, incidentally, Japan\u2019s first experiment in democracy. Japanese society had for hundreds of years been divided into castes, socially and legally \u2026 In the Ozu and other markets, however, social rank no longer mattered. No questions were asked of applicants about their status, family origin, educational background, or nationality. Everyone was welcome, from high-ranking military officers to lowly privates, landed nobles to tenant farmers, college professors to unemployed gamblers. They all started out equally, spreading a mat on the street or setting up shop on top of a box to sell their goods. They all wore the same ragged clothes, lived in similar jury-rigged barracks of corrugated tin, and bathed out of the same oil drums. As historian Kenji Ino later wrote, \u2018For a feudal country like Japan which had a long history of class and ethnic discrimination, this was indeed an unprecedented event.'\u201d \u2013 Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan, by Robert Whiting, 1999 Source of the full article: Tokyo \"Black Markets\", 1945.
