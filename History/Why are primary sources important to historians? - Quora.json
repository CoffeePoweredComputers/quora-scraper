            "answer_text": "There are a few good answers here, but a couple of aspects of primary sources have not been mentioned. Those aspects speak to reliability, and they speak to unreliability. The King Arthur myth (yes, I consider it a myth) became popular in the late eighth or early ninth century. The only reliable (i.e., primary) sources before that time do not mention a King Arthur. Gildas, a monk in Brittany, wrote a polemic entitled De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain). He states that he was born in Britain in the same year as the battle of Badon Hill (a.k.a. Mount Badon, Mons Badonicus in his Latin text). Gildas never mentions any King Arthur, nor does he name the commander of the British in that battle. Subsequent sources, such as Bede, do not mention any King Arthur. He doesn\u2019t show up until the Historia Brittonum by a ninth century Welsh monk, probably Nennius. Even Nennius doesn\u2019t mention any King Arthur in his initial account. However, he subsequently wrote a sort of an appendix of the twelve great victories of Arthur. This was when the King Arthur myth was starting to really take off, and his creation of a narrative of these battles is suspect. Gildas is not just a reliable source, he was considered a reliable source in his own lifetime. We can\u2019t even be sure that Nennius wrote the History of Britain, nor even that he existed. In a case such as that, you go with the primary source because he was both known and considered reliable by other sources in his own lifetime, and because his account is not contradicted until centuries later, when monks in scriptoria had begun promoting their work to attract trade. Geoffrey of Monmouth, the cleric most responsible for the King Arthur hooraw is so obviously unreliable that anyone should be embarrassed to take his account at face value. Apart from writing his magnum opus in the twelfth century, more than six hundred years after the battle of Badon Hill probably took place, the contents of his narrative are too fantastic to credit. Primary sources, however, can be unreliable, too, which is why sound historiography is necessary when attempting to establish the reliability of sources. A good example of this is Jean Froissart. The Chronicles of Jean Froissart are the single, comprehensive source for the first half of what we call the Hundred Years War. Froissart was born in the same year that Edward III of England claimed the French throne, and began that war. Froissart was born in Hainault, the western-most county of the Holy Roman Empire. When he was about 20 or 21, he was employed in the household of Philippa of Hainault, who was the wife and queen of Edward III. His accounts are somewhat suspect because his sources were all from Englishmen (of the Anglo-Norman variety), and he doesn\u2019t have a critical thing to say about the conduct of the war. Well, you wouldn\u2019t if that were your situation. There is a Latin term used in jurisprudence, which is also used in historiography\u2014cui bono. It means who benefits. Obviously, a man employed in the household of the Queen of England would only benefit from telling tales of heroic daring do on the part of the English. His accounts are to be taken with several grains of salt. Even so, they tell us a great deal about how the people of the late 14th century saw themselves, how they wished to be portrayed. But one needs to look for other sources, other accounts, to compile a full and reliable account. Finally, some accounts aren\u2019t really primary sources, they are just the first accounts available, and often show it in their dubious reliability. For example, the Leifr Eiriksson Saga, the \u201cLeif Ericsson Story,\u201d recounts events at the end of the tenth century. But it was an oral tradition, it was recounted by skalds until it was first written down by Icelandic monks some time in the 11th century. That obviously removes from it the cachet of a primary account. Just as is the case with someone such as Geoffrey of Monmouth, it can sometimes be almost embarrassing how unreliable the text obviously is. When Leif departs from Greenland on the voyage which takes him to his \u201cVinland,\u201d the written account says that he sailed into the south south-west for two days. That would have left him wallowing in the Labrador Sea, hundreds of miles from any land. Very likely, a copying error accounts for that silliness. (In Westviking: The Ancient Norse in Greenland and North America, Farley Mowat speculates that a copyist mistook \u201cU\u201d for \u201cII.\u201d Even as late as the thirteenth century, there was no distinction made between \u201cU\u201d and \u201cV.\u201d As a numeral, \u201cV\u201d means five, and you could sail south south-west from Cape Farewell in Greenland and reach Newfoundland in five days.) This sort of thing happens all the time. The copies of these sagas, for example, date from the 13th or 14th century\u2014they were written down in the late 11th century. Two or three hundred years is long enough for a host of errors to creep in, especially from monks who have never been to sea in their lives. Primary sources are important, but no source is to be automatically considered reliable on the face of it. ",

            "answer_text": "What else would be used to construct history? History doesn't write itself down nor does it write itself up and publish it so others can read and learn from it.Our best grasp at history lies in the primary sources. If we use secondary sources, we're not going to the source... and we're just echoing what someone else already wrote. The error that new students of history can often make is to assume that primary sources are just dusty documents. Not true. Everything can be a primary source. Archeologists who are themselves historians use 'stuff' as their primary sources. If you write a book on Changing Hairstyles of 18th Century France As They Reflect Rising Republican Values - you'd use diaries, paintings, letters and some stuff - the tools used to 'dress' hair would be a valid primary source on changing hair styles. In science they do experiments to uncover new knowledge. What are the primary sources of science? Living creatures if it's biology, vials and chemicals if it's chemistry, photons and neutrons if it's physics. Those are incredible simplifications of course but it makes the point. The sciences don't often use the term 'primary sources' but they do use primary sources for their research. Historians do experiments as well. They don't use vials or living creatures - usually - their primary sources tend to be written sources but in history anything can be used as a primary source if it fits the topic. ",
