            "answer_text": "What did Aristotle teach Alexander the Great?  The division between the sciences as we know them today did not exist in the time of Aristotle and Alexander. Aristotle was partially responsible for the division of the sciences as we have come to know them since his time. Aristotle\u2019s works, and how they were titled and distributed after his death, gives a clue as to how Aristotle would have structured his curriculum. Aristotle wrote at least five treatises on biological subjects, and Aristotle himself was a careful observer of nature, as we can gather from these texts. I suspect that these natural science topics were likely prominent in Alexander\u2019s education by the philosopher. After Alexander departed Aristotle\u2019s tutelage and went off the conquer the world, he sent back plant and animal curiosities to Aristotle as he encountered them in his travels, which implies an appreciation of Aristotle\u2019s interests in biology, which he likely passed along, if only in part, to his pupil. Aristotle also wrote several treatises on moral and political subjects. Given that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato, and Plato emphasized the moral education of youth, and speculated on the best possible state, Aristotle might have harbored Platonic ambitions when given the opportunity to educate the son of Philip of Macedon. If he did, there is little indication that this made as much impression upon the young Alexander as did Aristotle\u2019s interest in biology. Alexander is a study in the absence of impulse control, which often made him an effective military commander, but also resulted in the death of several friends, the burning of Persepolis, and probably his own early death at Babylon. Aristotle was probably wise enough not to attempt to teach much metaphysics to a boisterous young pupil, but no doubt he touched on a number of topics in physics and cosmology, on which Aristotle also wrote extensively. However, I may be wrong about this, as Plutarch has this to say in his Life of Alexander: Well, then, as a place where master and pupil could labour and study, he assigned them the precinct of the nymphs near Mieza, where to this day the visitor is shown the stone seats and shady walks of Aristotle. It would appear, moreover, that Alexander not only received from his master his ethical and political doctrines, but also participated in those secret and more profound teachings which philosophers designate by the special terms \u201cacroamatic\u201d and \u201cepoptic,\u201d and do not impart to many. For after he had already crossed into Asia, and when he learned that certain treatises on these recondite matters had been published in books by Aristotle, he wrote him a letter on behalf of philosophy, and put it in plain language. And this is a copy of the letter. \u201cAlexander, to Aristotle, greeting. Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men\u2019s common property? But I had rather excel in my acquaintance with the best things than in my power. Farewell.\u201d Accordingly, in defending himself, Aristotle encourages this ambition of Alexander by saying that the doctrines of which he spoke were both published and not published; for in truth his treatise on metaphysics is of no use for those who would either teach or learn the science, but is written as a memorandum for those already trained therein. So perhaps Alexander was taught a little metaphysics and some of the philosopher\u2019s \u201cunwritten doctrines,\u201d but I suspect that Alexander\u2019s young age probably magnified in his own mind the esoteric doctrines he received from Aristotle. Here is more from Plutarch\u2019s Life of Alexander: Moreover, in my opinion Alexander\u2019s love of the art of healing was inculcated in him by Aristotle preeminently. For he was not only fond of the theory of medicine, but actually came to the aid of his friends when they were sick, and prescribed for them certain treatments and regimens, as one can gather from his letters. He was also by nature a lover of learning and a lover of reading. And since he thought and called the Iliad a viaticum of the military art, he took with him Aristotle\u2019s recension of the poem, called the Iliad of the Casket, and always kept it lying with his dagger under his pillow, as Onesicritus informs us; and when he could find no other books in the interior of Asia, he ordered Harpalus to send him some. So Harpalus sent him the books of Philistus, a great many of the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus, and the dithyrambic poems of Telestes and Philoxenus. Aristotle he admired at the first, and loved him, as he himself used to say, more than he did his father, for that the one had given him life, but the other had taught him a noble life; later, however, he held him in more or less of suspicion, not to the extent of doing him any harm, but his kindly attentions lacked their former ardour and affection towards him, and this was proof of estrangement. However, that eager yearning for philosophy which was imbedded in his nature and which ever grew with his growth, did not subside from his soul, as is testified by the honour in which he held Anaxarchus, by his gift of fifty talents to Xenocrates, and by the attentions which he so lavishly bestowed upon Dandamis and Calanus. The other historical accounts of Alexander the Great\u2014notably by Quintus Curtius Rufus and Flavius Arianus\u2014begin later in Alexander\u2019s life, when Alexander\u2019s father had died and he had come into power, and his education was effectively over.

            "answer_text": "In 342 BCE and interesting fact happens: Philosopher Aristotle is called in the realm of Pella, to teach the future emperor Alexander III of Macedonia. Aristotle tutors him for three years, until the 18-year-old student Alexander begins to fight alongside his dad Philip II. Plutarch describes Alexander as a brilliant student in his Parallel Lives; so high-performing that he is introduced to the acroamatic (\u201cfor hearing only\u201d) and to the esoteric doctrines (\u201cbelonging to an inner circle\u201d) - originally referred to the secret teachings of Greek philosophers-. Those two doctrines are the core of the Aristotelian philosophy and the highest knowledge precepts at that time. Plutarch himself cites Alexander\u2019s feedback of Aristotle\u2019s \u201cMetaphysics\u201dbook: I\u2019d rather to distinguish myself for broaden knowledge than for my fighting skills Aristotle replies asserting that the book doesn\u2019t include any utilities neither in teaching nor in auto-didactic study of this subject but it delivers a guideline to those who have been educated according to the theories exposed in this book. We can already notice their dialectic relationship, which is exempt from ideological criticisms. They develop mutual respect and admiration, similarly to the typical relationship between fathers and sons. Alexander\u2019s formation follows the Classic Hellenic education, revolving around the ideals of kalos (\u201chandsome\u201d) and agathos (\u2018good\u2019) on the basis of Iliad readings, whose Aristotle writes down notes for his personal lessons. Alexander carries around this ad hoc edition all the time. He is described to be a books ravenous character; for instance, he orders philosophers to send him several major dramatic books and Greek poetry works. Therefore, historians claim that he also read the Iliad before conducting the army to Gaugamela. He, in fact, admired Achilles and was determined to emulate his attitude.  ",
