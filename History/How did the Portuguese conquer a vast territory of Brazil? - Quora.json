            "answer_text": "Firstly Portugal started to colonize the coast and trade with the natives, extracting Brazil wood mostly after 1530 then we started to colonize the south coast including Rio de Janeiro because of the French threath in that zone. After the Iberian Union and with the independence restoration, Portugal recovered his global power and with more population, started to colonize through the jungle mostly because of the gold and diamonds demand, so with the Colonial Brazil population growing and the Portuguese too and with more or less 1 million people moving from Portugal to Colonial Brazil in the entire XVIII century, giving more population to colonize that vast land mass and according the borders with Spain.
