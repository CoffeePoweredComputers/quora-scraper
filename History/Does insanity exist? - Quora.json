            "answer_text": "Insanity is a label based on individual beliefs and actions and based strictly on the environmental and social norms of a given society and not inherent within the person in any way. Placing said individual in another environment more accepting of their behavior and beliefs makes the definition meaningless as a descriptive term. This would apply to viewpoints both outside the society the individual is in, and from within a person\u2019s own experience.  Due to the relativity of its definition, \"insanity\" as an objective term within one\u2019s own experience, does not exist. ",
