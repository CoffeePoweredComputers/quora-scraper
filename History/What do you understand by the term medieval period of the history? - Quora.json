            "answer_text": "What do you understand by the term medieval period of the history? European History is normally divided into three periods: Classical, Mediaeval, and Modern. Mediaeval is derived from the latin medium aeval and means \u201cmiddle ages\u201d; it refers to the period of time between the collapse of the Western Roman Empire (476AD) and the beginning of the High Renaissance (c. 1500 AD). Some people argue that we ought to end the Mediaeval period at the beginning of the Renaissance, around 1300AD. I disagree with this purely on the basis that it cuts out almost the entire period that people actually think of when they say mediaeval. Knights in shining armour would no longer be a mediaeval phenomenon. The Middle Ages are generally divided into the Early, High, and Late mediaeval periods. The early begins with the migration period, the Anglo-Saxon invasion of England etc., and progresses through the Viking age up to around 1000AD. The end of the Viking age and the beginning of the Norman invasion of England kick off the High Middle Ages, characterised by the development of feudalism and manorialism, and the launching of the Crusades. The Late Middle Ages is generally held to last from around 1250 - 1500AD, and includes the development of plate armour and eventually the discovery of gunpowder, the Hundred Years War between England and France, and a renewed interest in classical texts and philosophy.

            "answer_text": "The medieval period spans across a much wider time frame than most originally consider. It can be sectioned into Early - Middle - Late periods. Beginning ; if we must have a time line marker, with the withdrawal of Roman military and government from England & Western Europe. The cultural change from the mid 400s is often marked by the emergency of the cultural impact & influence of Christianity. It continues in a strong trajectory until the birth of the ideas of the Renaissance in the early 1400s. My Medieval university professor would not teach past 1350.  ",
