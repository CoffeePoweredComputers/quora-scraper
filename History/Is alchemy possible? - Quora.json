            "answer_text": "Well, anything is possible. If you are referring to the tansmutation of elements, then biology appears to already does this. We yet have a lot to learn from non-manmade phenomenon. Science depends on the human brain which, by nature, needs to format a fairly simple presentation of the world. 99% of incoming information every second needs to be filtered out, just for survival. Science represents another large percentage of signal removal. It shines a small spotlight on the possible. Many discoveries are pure accident. Is this alchemy? If you are asking about lead to gold, then science breaks down mainly because it is too intentionally directed. That is, the intentions of science short-circuit the process. Besides, turning lead to gold is about greed, not alchemy. The two do not mix. Traditionally, alchemy is a spiritual process of unification. It was intended as a mental means to create oneself into better person in a humanistic sense. The chemical aspect was symbolic. Gold is seen as a spiritual goal. The process takes dedication. Once you have achieved your desire to be a better person, then you can start on trying to do it chemically. Start here for example: The Theory and Practice of Alchemy Alchemy fell into disrepute due to all the charlatans who tried to make a quick buck off a gullible public. For this reason, the physical claims were banned in England and other countries. It was these charlatan\u2019s that created the myth about alchemy being all about physically turning lead into gold. Snake oil is always popular. Just go to a new age healing convention! This misinformation concerning alchemy is still popular these days. After all who wouldn\u2019t want to turn lead into gold? That is what gambling is all about. Who amongst us wouldn\u2019t have liked to have invested in Apple and now be a multimillionaire? The lottery system is based on turning lead into gold. Turning one dollar into a billion is pure physical alchemy. Yet many people believe in it. That kind of alchemy is alive and well. In 2014 Americans apparently spent $70 billion on lottery tickets. Yes, alchemy is alive and well! Many people seriously believe it is possible. Money speaks. Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, you can turn lead into gold.  But it takes so much energy and money to run the machine to do so that it will never, ever be economically worth it.Fact or Fiction?: Lead Can Be Turned into Gold But what of the fabled transmutation of lead to gold? It is indeed possible\u2014all you need is a particle accelerator, a vast supply of energy and an extremely low expectation of how much gold you will end up with. More than 30 years ago nuclear scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in California succeeded in producing very small amounts of gold from bismuth, a metallic element adjacent to lead on the periodic table. The same process would work for lead, but isolating the gold at the end of the reaction would prove much more difficult, says David J. Morrissey, now of Michigan State University, one of the scientists who conducted the research. \u201cWe could have used lead in the experiments, but we used bismuth because it has only one stable isotope,\u201d Morrissey says. The element\u2019s homogeneous nature means it is easier to separate gold from bismuth than it is to separate gold from lead, which has four stable isotopic identities. And as for the price? In 1980, when the bismuth-to-gold experiment was carried out, running particle beams through the Bevalac cost about $5,000 an hour, \u201cand we probably used about a day of beam time,\u201d recalls Oregon State University nuclear chemist Walter Loveland, one of the researchers on the project. Glenn Seaborg, who shared the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work with heavy elements and who died in 1999, was the senior author on the resulting study. \u201cIt would cost more than one quadrillion dollars per ounce to produce gold by this experiment,\" Seaborg told the Associated Press that year. The going rate for an ounce of gold at the time? About $560. What would it take to make it worth it? Dirt cheap particle accelerators, and energy so cheap that a factory wouldn't have to worry about power bills ever. ",
