            "answer_text": "There are many beautiful countries in their own way. There is really not a most beautiful country in the world. But what I can say is that Greece is absolutely an incredibly beautiful country one of the most beautiful in the world. Greece has a magical combination that is very rare in this world. Greece has 80% vast mountains, of which 20% of all of Europe\u2019s Ultra peak mountains lies in Greece (Ultra peak mountains are mountains that rise more than 1500m above it\u2019s lowest surrounding area). 16.000km of the most crystal clear coastlines, 6000 islands each unique, breathtaking natural beauties and so on. Then Greece has 32% forests which gives a perfect blend with it\u2019s fantastic landscapes/mountains throughout the country and the seas/coastlines/islands, resulting in a rich tapestry of colors. Greece is also one of the most natural hot spring rich countries in the world with 800 natural hot-springs. Incredibly picturesque towns and villages dotting the land. Perfect climate. Then Greece\u2019s incredible culture and unparalleled history, the heavenly food, and the very warmhearted hospitality of the Greeks that is famous throughout. From snow-capped mountains all the way to the only natural palm forests in Europe. From virgin forested lands/islands all the way to volcano\u2019s and volcanic islands. and from the richest biodiversity in Europe and a dream for botanists to an incredible country for mountain hiking. The combination of all of these elements combined is very rare in the world. And what makes it even more rare is that in Greece you can do all of it in a single day. Among the very few countries countries that have mountains or sea or other elements mentioned that Greece has, one needs to travel 2000 km to visit the sea, or 1200 km to visit the first mountains. In Greece you could swim in the morning and be in the mountains during the day, hiking and visiting even archaeological sites of thousands of years old of which you didn\u2019t knew they exist nor found in your Lonely planet book. And at the end of the day you could be in a gorgeous town/village and eat angels on your tongue. That combination is magical and that is exceptionally rare to find anywhere This is one answer that I wrote about the immense diversity of stunning beauties in Greece that shows what I mean: Anthony Mulder's answer to What does Greece look like?

            "answer_text": "Greece is certainly beautiful, but I was once told that the most reproduced view in the world is pictures of the Geiranger Fjord in Norway (unconfirmed) I have seen posters and framed examples in many places all over the world during my travels, something that I always found surprising so the statement above might be true. Anyway beauty is in the eye of the beholder and for me personally a place where snow clad mountains meet the sea is spot on.   ",
