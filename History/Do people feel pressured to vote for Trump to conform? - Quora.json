            "answer_text": "Do people feel pressured to vote for Trump to conform? You can\u2019t be serious! Conform to what???? Lunacy, idiocy, debauchery, corruption, lies, deceit??? Thank God people are waking up from the stupor that this country has been in!!! People are FINALLY recognizing the true harm he has done to our country. 100,000 people dead and what does the country get out of him this Memorial Day? Golf and foul-mouthed and insulting tweets. NOT A THING SAID ABOUT ALL OF THE DEAD THAT LIE AT HIS FEET - BECAUSE OF HIM!!! He is a total fake, a fraud, a liar, a thief, a conman, a narcissist AND HE DOESN\u2019T GIVE A F**K ABOUT THE PEOPLE HE KILLED!!! THANK GOD AMERICA IS GOING TO BE HEADING ON THE RIGHT PATH - AWAY FROM HIM. HE HAS NEVER CARED ABOUT THIS COUNTRY OR ITS PEOPLE. Our country needs to heal! He has divided us, pitted us against one another, instilled an \u2018US VS THEM\u2019 mentality. We need to realize that we are ALL AMERICANS and we are in such a terrible state THAT HE PUT US IN. His words, \u2018drain the swamp,\u2019 is an outrage! The swamp is now totally filled and solid. Solid with republicans that gave trump a blank check to do whatever he wanted to our country! Ignored all of the times he walked all over the constitution; gave him a free ride to break laws. They were the ones that failed to hold him accountable during the senate impeachment. They were the ones that let him use his position to seek his personal revenge and vendetta afterwords. He has turned our country into his personal playground for him and those with wealth and power. Trump, his admin and the Washington republicans need to go in November and it certainly looks like it is heading that way. He does not deserve another 4 years - otherwise, we will not have a country left! Joe Biden worked with Obama to bring our economy back from the worst recession our country had seen since the Great Depression so he knows what needs to be done. Republicans do not deserve another chance. They have betrayed us for their own personal gains and agenda. Biden is a man of integrity, which this country desperately needs. He has laid out his plans for bringing the virus under control with testing and tracing. After 8 years as Vice President with Obama, he can hit the ground running. This November, Americans will only have 2 parties to vote, democratic and republican. I used to consider myself an independent but that is not a possible vote in this election. On Quora, I have have read much of the democrats being accused and condemned and I am not saying that some of that is rightly being said. However, this election is different. Nowhere in the history of our country has a political party so betrayed their oaths of office, the constitution and the law as the republican party has done! There is absolutely no way to compare the damage that the republican party has done to America under trump compared to the democrats at any point in time. Our country needs multiple political parties but the republican party has shown they no longer care for their constituents or the country. With only 2 choices in November, the republicans WILL NOT be doing anything for average Americans. People may not like the democrats, but they were the ones that put together an initial plan when the coronavirus struck. The republicans did NOTHING! The democrats were the ones that fought for the individual stimulus checks to people. They were the ones to fight for the SBA loans (which the republicans corrupted with big corporations.) Federal reserve chairman Jerome Powell stated that more stimulus funds will be needed for people and they are fighting for that now as the republicans are already fighting against longer unemployment.s If average Americans are going to be helped during this catastrophe, it will be through the democrats. They are fighting to halt foreclosures and evictions during this time. They are fighting for people to have their utilities remain on throughout this. The republicans are starting to say their usual \u201cit will cost too much.\u201d During the robust economy we just had, trump did not apply a single dime to the deficit; in fact, he increased it drastically. THIS IS THE TIME THAT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA HAVE TO COME FIRST!!! WE ARE THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA AND UNLESS WE ARE ON OUR FEET, AMERICA WILL NOT BE ON IT\u2019S FEET!!! COME NOVEMBER, VOTE TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS OUT OF OFFICE AND INTO EXTINCTION. Trump and the republicans need to be swept to the gutter, where they belong. ",

            "answer_text": "Conform to what? To whom? Every Trump voter I know voted for Trump because we don't believe in the Democratic Party. We didn't like Trump but we knew that no Democrat would stand up for what we believe in. Furthermore, we will vote for him again because the Democratic Party is even farther from us than before. The ultimate reason for me was the SCOTUS and how hostile the Democrats are to the Constitution. I've since come to have even less faith in the Democratic Party in the wake of CA AB5, the PRO And various legislation that they've cooked up for the country. I voted for Trump because I personally am not interested in the Fundamental Transformation of the United States of America. I figured that out all by myself without any help of anyone who I'm supposed to be conforming to. And if I'm taking the tone of your question correctly, it's your attempt to make me conform to polite society and vote Democrat. No thank you. Try this on. I've never been shamed into voting for a Republican but there are constant attempts to shame me for voting for Trump. Try this on as well, if you'd be so kind. Even the first five minutes.  ",
