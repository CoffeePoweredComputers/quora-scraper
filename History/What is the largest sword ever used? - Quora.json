            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \u201cused\u201d. There have been a lot of novelty-sized swords made over the years. And while most of these couldn\u2019t be wielded properly, that doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t ever used. Largest sword ever made was used by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Hamad to get into the Guinness Book of World Records. Lol. Like that\u2019s really the largest sword ever made. Anyway, does that count? If you mean something more particular, like the largest sword ever wielded by a human to inflict lethal injury on another human, then it\u2019s probably one of those big suckers that were more like metal lances with sharp edges that they experimented with back in ancient China. Ridiculous things, why make the whole thing out of metal rather than just the tip like a proper lance? I guess someone thought it would be \u2018better\u2019 as a sword. It certainly was more expensive. And way heavier. Sure, you could kill a dude with that. One dude. But good luck using it again in the same battle. It\u2019s possible that someone else was dumb enough to make an even bigger one and even try it in combat (or just test it on some hapless victim as a form of execution). There are limits to what a human can wield, but you might have to get particular about precisely what counts. After all, that big sword Bin Hamad used to get into the Guinness could be pushed over and kill someone (after unbolting it from the mounting). And I wouldn\u2019t bet against that eventually happening, either. It\u2019s got to have occurred to more people than just me. Nobody\u2019s done it yet, with that particular sword, but I know things like that have been done in the past, so does that actually count? It does count as using the sword, but so does getting into Guinness with it. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u014ddachi was often used on the battlefield during the Nanboku-ch\u014d period, which lasted for much of the fourteenth century, but was certainly built as early as the 5th century AD.During this period the \u014ddachis often exceeded the meter in length, were used by the infantry against the cavalry, and it is hypothesized to hurt the legs of the horses or to unsaddle the rider.Beyond this historical period, the use of this type of weapon fell into disuse and the main reason being that it was not a very practical sword to use in battles. This is an extreme example  I think generally the CLAYMORE fits, although there are likely others and perhaps lager but not common to their *type* ~ The largest sword (also called Claymore) used by man in times of war, was a disproportionate sword and that to be tamed, a large force was needed. The handling of this sword, required no special technique. It is known that the largest sword used came to measure up to 2.24 meters and weigh up to 10 kilos. ~ \u2694\ufe0f Medieval-Shop \u2694\ufe0f  ",
