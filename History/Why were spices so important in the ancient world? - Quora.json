            "answer_text": "Spices were a rarity, depending on where you lived, and the level of rarity controlled the price; some of which came from thousands of miles away. They were essential for cooking and in some cases, for medicine (the most valuable \u201cspice\u201d if you will was, of course salt, which was often used as a preservative as well as for flavoring and even in medicines, which was worth its weight in gold. Workers were sometimes even paid in salt instead of silver or gold). Spices were also used in making perfumes and incense (heavily used not just by the churches, by the nobles to help cover the smell of open sewers like moats, and \u201cwater closets\u201d (or restrooms). and the castle in general.
