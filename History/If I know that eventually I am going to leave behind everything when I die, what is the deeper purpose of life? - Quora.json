            "answer_text": "Many people, over the centuries, have rejected the idea that life has any purpose at all. They are called nihilists. They believe that, for every individual, at the point of death everything winks out. No more consciousness, no continuity. It is in some ways an appealing notion. Complete absence of anything, any awareness, any sound or light or feeling, is the ultimate peace. Reaching that peace may be the purpose of all life. Everything else \u2014 reproduction, building, accumulation, improving the earth, helping others and cooperating so as to do more than an individual could do \u2014 they believe is secondary. Just something to do while we are waiting to die. For most people, that is not a very satisfying view. They feel that the pain, the effort, the conflicts, the stresses, the sufferings of life must have \u2014 ought to have, should have == some kind of purpose. Something that justifies the sacrifices we make to survive and to advance in our lives. You want someone to tell you what is that purpose. Not unusual. Billions of people have wanted that, over the centuries. A very large number have devoted their working lifetimes to discovering, or to formulating, a statement of the purpose of life. To a large extent, it is the reason why religions were developed. You are not going to learn that purpose from a posting on Quora. None of us here knows that, although many will tell you something that satisfies them as a purpose for their existence. Yet those statements vary among people, and there is no reason to accept one idea as more right or more true or more inspired than any other. However, all of these people who will try to advise you have come one step closer to defining the purpose of life. It is a recognition that the purpose of life may well be whatever you find satisfying for yourself, as a sense or direction of purpose for life. Hence, service to others, suits some people. Self-understanding suits others. Sustained worship of an unseen deity suits others. Carnal pleasure suits others. Power or material wealth gives others their purpose. And so on. Defining a purpose for life, which you believe in, is an adequate answer for many. Personally, I think there may be an even higher purpose, but I greatly doubt that it is knowable during our lifetimes. Probably if we knew it, that would defeat the purpose itself. The absence of knowing what we are expected to accomplish, is what makes us able to accomplish it. I am one of those who believes there is something beyond this life, some kind of continuation of existence, but of a nature we cannot possibly imagine. I suspect that this life provides us an opportunity for preparedness, to become ready to become part of an enormously superior kind of existence. Here is an analogy. A baby inside a womb has, at the later stages of development, some ability to think \u2014 though just barely. It can be aware of shocks, it can feel pain, it can sense certain inputs from the outside world such as music, it can learn and remember, and so on. But the baby has no concept of an air environment, of breathing, of eating, of seeing, of other beings, of cold, and so on. Its entire existence in the womb is one of preparation (mainly involuntary, of course) for birth and for participating in a type of life it cannot even conceive of. In my personal estimation, preparation is why we are here. We have the opportunity for a future existence which is unimaginably greater than anything this earth can offer. We prepare ourselves for this by learning, by how we interact with the earth and our environment, and by how we interact with other people. The last of these may be the most important. How well we develop cooperation, empathy, compassion, self-sacrifice, service, generosity, selflessness, honesty and integrity, restraint and self-control, tolerance, and other uniquely human characteristics may be the control of where we will fit and what we can do in our forthcoming existence. Conversely, those whose lives focus on greed, self-indulgence, isolation and rejection and the of others, selfishness, physical pleasures, destruction, and personal pleasure may be hindering their own access or diminishing their own position in whatever new existence awaits us. Perhaps. Or this may be idle fantasizing. It just happens to be my viewpoint, not something you should adopt. What you should do \u2014 indeed, what I think you must do \u2014 is to develop for yourself an idea of what you feel should be the purpose for your life. And then purse that. In the end, we all will have to look back upon our lifetimes, and decide whether we actually accomplished anything much in the area of the purposes we chose for ourselves. If we did, then we can die happy and fulfilled, regardless of what (if anything) awaits us next. ",

            "answer_text": "Ah! First of all congratulations that at least you came to this point. Even if you are able to appreciate it intellectually, it's not less than a feat because most of us don't even appreciate this intellectually. We get so disturbed by the pimple on our face and linkup of that famous actress that we just forget to ask ourselves, like, what's the point? WHY? What am I really doing? Am I sure that this is how life is to be lived? And then, we stumble upon this millennia old question of purpose of life. \u2018What is the purpose of life?\u2019 However intellectual or sophisticated this question might look, once you really dig deep into it, you are able to see the stupidity behind it. Purpose. Profit. Goal. Point. Did these words had any meaning for us before trade started? Do these words have any meaning for animals, birds, plants or just granules of sand? One species out of the millions present on this planet which is located in one of the billions of planetary systems which is located in one of the billions star cluster which is located in one of the billions of galaxies is seeking some purpose for itself. This must have been a good question in the platonic era, but the kind of scientific and technological development we have reached, this is just lame. To make things more clear, have a look at \u2018the pale blue dot', and read what Carl Sagan has to say about it:  [The above is an image taken by Voyager I space probe in 1990 from a distance of 40.5 AU (AU= Distance between the Earth and the Sun, and trust me this is too small on the cosmic scale.)] \u201cLook again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.\u201d There is no deeper purpose as such. It makes no difference to the existence that you are spending your life. It just affects you. Even if you want to attribute a purpose to it. It is just about you. Nobody has to do anything with it. Just chill!  At last, I would like to quote Acharya Prashant (\u0906\u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0936\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924) \u201cWhat is the purpose of life? To come to a point where you can see the stupidity of this question\u201d ",
