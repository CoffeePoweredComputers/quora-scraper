            "answer_text": "Yes, skeptic. However, I doubt such a human exists, because our societies are to some degree funded on things for which there is no evidence. A true skeptic would likely not survive in today\u2019s world. Too much of what we rely on is based on belief. For example, countries and money are conventions. There is nothing inherently about a piece of paper that makes it worth anything. We agree to believe that a $5 bill has purchasing value and can be traded for commodities, and the very foundation of our economic system is that collective belief. Even if you actually doubt that $5 bill has any value, because indeed there is nothing about it that gives it value except that a lot of people agree it has value, you don\u2019t quite get to opt out of the system. There is also nothing inherently about different north American regions that make some of it the United States, some of it Canada, or some of it Mexico. We agree to believe in a border, and put some guys that also agree to it to guard it, but this all indeed is based on conventions, or collective beliefs. Nothing about the physical properties of the land make it a country or another. If you cross the imaginary boundary without permission, you might get shot and killed, even if you don\u2019t believe there are such things as nations because the laws of physics can\u2019t prove there is such a thing. The same can be said about laws, and a whole lot of other things that we have to believe in order to organize and cooperate in large societies. Religions and gods are part of these ideas that organized societies. In fact, until just a few centuries ago religion was pretty much synonymous with the law; you didn\u2019t get to just not believe in it because there was no evidence and opt out, unless you were keen on being burned alive. It would be comparable to not believing in the law today. Whether you believe in it or not, if you act like you don\u2019t you may struggle to survive in a society. Indeed, the very existence and survival of several entities is based solely on people believing in them. There are countless gods, religions, nations, and currencies that no longer exist because people stopped believing in them. The survival of several of these entities requires continuous reinforcement of belief. So, to some degree humans believe in some bullshit just because it enables cooperation in large societies, not because it is true or can be proven with the scientific method. ",

            "answer_text": "Such a person could actually be considered a fool. Why? Simply because no one owns the corner market on Truth and Reality. The wise skeptic is skeptical of his own skepticism. Evidence itself is metaphysicallyl/philosophically contentious. Evidence itself is interpreted by minds and minds are metaphysical by nature. There is no authority in philosophy and we all play the part of the Metaphysical High-Priest and beat our own philosophical tom-toms pontificating on the actual Truth of things. We bring all things to the Supreme Court of Mind as though we are the authority for the actual Truth of things and the true state of affairs. But the reality is that evidentialism has been debunked all the way around the philosophical dial. It was in the 1960's when the United States Supreme Court realized that Science could prove nothing and made it law that one must be found guilty beyond a \u201creasonable\u201d doubt. Now what exactly is \u201creasonable\u201d concerning the nature of reality itself and to whom's logic and epistemology do we subscribe? I knew a man personally who spent 38 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. The evidence against him was interpreted so as to gain a conviction but he was ultimately exonerated 38 years after the fact. By way of analogy, many evidentialists actually murder Truth and Reality by presupposing they actually KNOW truth and reality. They have no clue of Metaphysics in general and they take their own dogmatic conjecture as the actual Truth of things and the true state of affairs concerning reality itself. There is much more to this but you would do well to contemplate it for yourself. ",
