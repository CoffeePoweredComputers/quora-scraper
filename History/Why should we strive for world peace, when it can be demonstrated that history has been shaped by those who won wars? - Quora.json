            "answer_text": "Everyone wants peace. I, for one, would like to stay alive and well for as along as I possibly can. Wars would only come in the way, wouldn't they?   History is not just a sequence of wars. It is a lot more than that. History is defined by how the people of different times lived and conducted themselves. We can learn history through the eyes of culture, economics, trade and literature as well. These are things that build over time and are of a more peaceful nature. These are the ones that decide how people live and what they did during their lives. For example:  Shakespeare wouldn't have written plays if he had to fight the Spanish Armada. Gandhi was able to change history by not raising a hand in violence. More recently, Didier Drogba ended a civil war in his country.Peaceful accomplishments can put you in history books just as easily. War, on the other hand, is a rather dramatic occurrence that changes the life of people suddenly and with great force. This pushes it to prominence and we read about it in history books, though it is not the only way we can study history. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you are wrong. The world is getting more peaceful and we are not going back (but does fluctuate like stock market, and just like stock market \u2026. long term trend is getting better). The reason I say this trend will stay is, my theory, that the trend is due to the improvement of communication between people. At prehistoric time, effective communication can reach only within a tribe (with spoken languages), but not beyond a tribe. War happened between tribes. As technologies (written language and better transportation) improves, effective communication could reach within a city and nearby area, as \u201ccity states\u201d. War occurred at a level of cities or small regions. War also broke out between people naturally divided by mountain ranges, waters, languages or races. (Different races or languages is a good indication, and the results, of lacking communication.) As time goes on, effective communication (newspaper, radio and TV) could reach larger and larger area, \u201cwar unit\u201d also gets larger and larger, even beyond the country level (e.g. WWW I and II). As the power of internet coming, we should be able to communicate anywhere in the world with ease. However, this doesn\u2019t guarantee of peace, just doesn\u2019t make sense for WWIII. Within the war unit, people can mostly communicate to solve conflicts to avoid destructive violence. In earlier days, loyalty is the process to keep peace while information were concentrated at the top of the hierarchy. Everyone listens to the king\u2019s order. After the newspaper became available, people at bottom could also receive information and demanded for power. Democratic system has become very successful in the last 200+ years. Democracy is more peaceful then monarchy and come with human rights and etc to give you the desire of compassion and tolerance, which were not exist/popular in the monarchy time. So far, all developed/rich/modern countries are all democratic. (although democratic countries don\u2019t always developed/rich/modern.) I believe that communication tools (newspaper, radio, and TV) are behind this long term trend. If you think the above make sense, then internet will push this peace trend even further in general. This peace trend does mean less killing and wars, but the world will be more fast paced, more changes and less predictable. People will be more interdependent which does help for less wars. e.g. US and China are highly dependent on each other in terms of economy. In summary, I don\u2019t see communication capability will decrease in the future and people will increasingly learn how to live together better in the long term. ",
