            "answer_text": "any assertion about the prowess of a group or military can never be taken seriously unless you know the capabilities of the enemy they are up against. had the Vikings/Norse been so good at warfare why didn\u2019t they conquer and dominate Europe the way the Romans did? in part the answer is Vikings were in the main wreckers and looters all about the smash and grab. when the Vikings did go up against capable militaries they generally lost. raiders like the Huns, Vikings, Mongols or the Barbary Pirates are not driven by a religious agenda or political manifesto. for them it\u2019s all about the loot. once their adversaries can field competent armies the looters collapse into insignificance. when was the last time anyone worried about attacks coming out of Scandinavia or Mongolia? those supposed places of superior warriors were one trick ponies who often faced weak or inept opponents. why wasn\u2019t Norway or Mongolia ever able to launch attacks against their old victims or field a potent military say in 1786, 1859 or 1939? Germany was beaten up twice by the world in WW1 and WW2 yet still can field a formidable military today. ",
