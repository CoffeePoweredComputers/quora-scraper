            "answer_text": "Lack of a sustained insurrection and war. While historically there were hundreds of attempted rebellions and revolutions only Haiti and Cuba were successful against modern, past 200 years, regime of America. All people who have had a great war or rebellion against oppression have won respect, freedom though not always prosperity. African Americans have traded material prosperity, comparatively speaking compared to abject slavery and sharecropping, for minor to medium abundance. Which is why the distorted mythology of \"get the money, that gives you power and then you'll be respected\" runs so deep in African Americans. Let's say at the ending point of the Civil War instead of simply migration north or waiting on plantations we killed every single motherfucker lighter than a brown paper bag in our immediate vicinity....you got a lil' nervous at that thought, right?....no matter the cost. We could've snatched the South from its wounded by the North jaw and then negotiated back as the New Integrated South with the North. The North weakened by war would have to negotiated. Slit your masters throat when he's wounded. Haiti was able to defeat the French, Dutch, Spanish and British empires, Napoleon even!, because they had distance from the power sources and they struck mercilessly. They've paid by being blackballed for centuries but that's particularly due to no comparable free Black nation near Haiti. Most importantly they struck between the American and French revolutions, when the masters were weakened and preoccupied. Cuba, viva la revolution, ousting of Batista occurred because of the ability to leverage communist support, build peasant army and retain all properties and wealth hidden in Cuba by US, mob, etc.. Again slitting masters throat but this time snatching his wallet away as he tries to deal with bleeding. African Americans have treated injustice as a moral issue rather than a humanistic one. We allow ourselves to be designated Black and then try to find value and pride in that. That's similar to calling a woman cunt and her taking it as her first name. Even if she wears it proudly, it's still something SOMEONE else designate her. Liberation comes from self nomination. Now if I'm just another human like you and not a subcategory you've designated I depower your oppressive concept by equating us at the baseline. I do tho not for your acceptance but for history and future story...I do this to infect the minds of your children and my children with a new ideology that will be taught over and over. Black, racist injustice stands because race is a social construct and the people designated as Black have never made it dangerous for White people to perpetuate the construct through a hot war, weapons-blood-mayhem and a cold one, ideology-laws/morality-science based refuting logic. We keep arguing about the pride, history and efficacy of being cunts....so folk follow our leaf and treat us like people who are cool not only with being labeled but simplistically foolish enough to rename and reimage ourselves into the cunt designation. So, today, with a war, how do we unravel this?Play to the future, to my children and yours on two levels, genetic and ideological. Its hard to kill family. People of color must consciously integrate and make Dem swirl babies. Creating a new free racialized category will give those children two cultures to bridge, access, love and champion....this allows us to also perform ideological inception thru them back into their Whiter kin. Were going to have to forsake pure Blackness to dilute Whiteness. We must then play the genetic card by refusing to align racially in systems like the government. No more checking off anything but Mixed and Other. What they gonna do if I do it, its true and by legal biological processes, true? Hegemony is only subverted by inception not construction aligned to the system, the more Black I nominate myself the more Black you can make me in form and rules. Exploitation of the racial sexual taboos to gain access and then become co-heirs to the power structure. Ask yourself how many Jews are integrated this way into society? Even Ivanka Trump and Chelsea Clinton are married to Jewish men, imagine if they were married to Black men? But part of the eugenic race war will mean we Blacks, men and women, will have to get into the schools, clubs, businesses where the fertile, horny White chilluns is. We must educate for access to the utilize The Power of the P...fill in the genitalia appropriate to your sex-Ing. Gasp! Fuck for your freedom, baby. Genetic inception has occurred in a negative way in rapings around the world as part of destroying the genetic history and future story of whole countries, we have to see that as brutalized inception towards obliteration and instead practice inception to transformational integration. Then we can start negotiations on cultural differences because we'll all be at the dinner table....cause we're obviously and directly related. If your family pictures lack \"racial\" by that I mean melaninated folk or non-melinated folk, you're a passive supporter of racism.\"We're not racists, we just don't have any folk of other colors in our immediate family or even extended at Thanksgiving....\" That has to change in ALL families to eradicate injustice against...humans based on \"race\".
