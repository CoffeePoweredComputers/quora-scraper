            "answer_text": "Some historians suggest that in only the THIRD ELECTION, 1796, Thomas Jefferson was probably favored by more voters than John Adams, but Adams won anyway. However, in those days, many states still had legislatures select the presidential electors rather than let voters decide\u2026 therefore, it is difficult to say what the popular vote really was in 1796. At any rate, the Jeffersonians swept elections in 1800\u2026 but the original design of the Electoral College was so badly botched that Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied (even though Burr was supposed to be the VP candidate) and the election was thrown into the House of Representatives for many, many deadlocked ballots. It was nearly a Constitutional crisis brought on by the botched design of the E.C. Later, Andrew Jackson did receive more \u201cpopular\u201d votes than John Quincy Adams, but again the election was thrown into the House of Representatives\u2026 in which the Congressmen chose Adams rather than Jackson. J. Q. Adams probably won that election because he was better connected to men in Congress. Jackson cried foul, but everyone was stuck with a weird system. Andrew Jackson beat J. Q. Adams at the next election. ",

            "answer_text": "Andrew Jackson got the biggest portion of the popular vote in 1824, but John Quincy Adams became president. This was the first and I think the only election that was actually decided by the House of Representatives because no candidate got an absolute majority of the electoral vote, which is what is required to win the presidential election without a vote in Congress.
