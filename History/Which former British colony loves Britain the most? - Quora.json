            "answer_text": "British Guiana or \u201cBooker\u2019s Guiana\u201d. After 1966, British Guiana became Guyana. Guiana is an Amerindian Aboriginal word that means \u201cland of many waters\u201d. Guyana\u2019s location is North East South America. Compared to other parts of South America it is the only country that has English (or creole) as it\u2019s prime language. When the British left they left a thriving working economy with a sound infrastructure. The main employer was Bookers (-McConnell), hence \u201cBooker\u2019s Guiana\u201d, and they controlled a number of areas from Sugar Production, Retail Stores (Booker), motor vehicles, agricultural machinery, hardware and electrical goods, pharmaceuticals, office equipment, etc.. Booker was an excellent route to train the young population and in a lot of ways to move them up the value chain. Note that Booker is associated with the Booker literary prize. In a lot of ways, had the momentum been maintained, today, Guyana would have been the Singapore, the South Korea or the Hong Hong (China) of South America. Although Oil has been discovered we will see another example of a country that is plagued with the \u201cresource curse\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Australian here. I don't know if we love Britain the most, but there is definitely a love and sense that they are the mother country, from where our culture and language is derived. We're very adamant that we follow British spelling and language usage from U.K. English, not U.S. English. We still have lots of staunch monarchists although they're thinning out a bit now. And after all most of us have UK and Irish heritage, even if our ancestors were often cast out as convicts. I think we share a common mindset in many ways, although we lean towards informality and egalitarianism over formality, manners and class structures. It's pretty easy for Brits to settle in Australia and vice-versa in a cultural sense. We've probably grown more like each other over time. We certainly share self-deprecating and sarcastic humour, and \u2018taking the piss\u2019. Mostly they're better at it than we are. I'm sure everything I've written here could apply just as well for Kiwis (except the convict bit). ",
