            "answer_text": "Depends what do you compare. Estonia has nothing like the multimillion metropoli of Moscow and St.Petersburg, so there is not point to compare Estonia to them. Apples and oranges. There is also little point to compare Estonia to Russia\u2019s rich oil-producing regions, Estonia\u2019s mineral wealth is barely worth the costs to mine it up, definitely not something to create massive national wealth. The most appropriate is to compare Estonia to Russia\u2019s provincial towns in European part of Russia with little valuable resources, there the contrast is very stark in development.  Estonian GDP PPP in 2013 was 19 000$. While the data is 5 years old, you can clearly see here that there are very few rich regions in European part of Russia that are not part of huge metropoli or don\u2019t have huge mineral wealth. Samara oblast is a rare positive example of development on same level as Estonia, Samara achieved it\u2019s wealth from high-tech industry. For other rich regions: Murmansk has huge nickel reserves, Belgorod has 40% of Russian iron ore reserves. Komi has oil, Arhangelsk Oblast has oil, gold and titanium. The vast majority of regions without mineral wealth are much less developed, right next to Estonia is Pskov oblast where income by PPP is more than two times less than in Estonia. As a whole, Russia and Estonia are similarly developed, however in Russia, the development is much more unevenly distributed and is very dependant on population density and mineral wealth. Since Estonia doesn\u2019t have it well with either, you could say that Estonia is much more developed now than it could possibly be if it had been a part of Russia. One should also keep in mind that not all of that development of Estonia was self made. Estonia receives about 13% of it\u2019s GDP in subsidies from EU, while paying back only 4% of GDP to EU. ",

Estonia is the country of the future.Everything in Estonia is digitalized, for example their ID-Card hold all of their Information, from your Graduation Certificate to your driver\u2019s license, all in one card. At birth you get your own 11-digit identifier. Since 2000 Estonia is the first country to declare Internet access a basic human right and children learn in computer programming at school and kindergarten. There are examples of people who created a company in 20minutes without going anywhere ( CEO of Funderbeam ). The process to create a company in a non-digital country would take weeks, to get all the papers, moving from Social Security Agency to the Tax board and so on. All of the tax-files of Estonia are online and literally everything is online in Estonia.The Prime Minister said :\u201d I never signed any Law physically \u2026 Never\u201d. Estonia is without a doubt THE country of the future and shows how other countries will turn out in a few decades. Other countries which are on the same way : Singapur, Japan and India, though those countries are in the initial steps and nowhere near Estonia. ",
