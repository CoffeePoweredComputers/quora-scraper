            "answer_text": "Peru has the second largest population of Japanese people in Latin America after Brazil and the largest population of Chinese people in Latin America. Source But since the economic rise of China and the rest of SE Asia, the immigration of Asian people to South America has mostly halted and in Peru in particular is reversing with nikkei (people descended of Asian immigrants) returning back to Asia searching for better jobs due to the booming economies there. Meanwhile most of the Asian descended population in Peru has mostly assimilated to their new country due to the huge differences between language, culture and religion between Peru and Asia, which makes it harder to keep in touch with their Asian roots when so much of the local idiosyncrasy is Western-based.
