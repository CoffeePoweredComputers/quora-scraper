            "answer_text": "In the short term, maybe yes but in the long term, definitely no. Easier answer first: definitely no in the long term because we have seen no historical precedent for the same. If I rephrase your question, you ask if inflation always leads to increasing inflation. Thus, it is enough if I prove inflation does not lead to increasing inflation with at least one counter example. I will do even better since all economies across the world across history are counter examples. We definitely know that no economy has seen only rising inflation (though some economies seem to be more prone to inflationary tendencies). Uncontrolled rising inflation ends with some dislocation, most likely in the exchange rate (more below). In the short term, inflation could precede higher inflation. It could even lead to the same i.e., causation and not just correlation. Let us see why. Back to the basics: inflation, = increasing prices, is a situation where demand (of goods or services) is more than supply. Under normal situations, when demand of a good or service is increased more than supply, we see a supply-side response i.e., producers increase capacity and supply for the good or service. This usually takes some time because of the lead time in setting up a factory or increasing labour force. During this time inflation may continue to rise. Eventually, supply matches, and usually exceeds, demand. At that point, disinflationary tendencies set in = prices start increasing at a slower rate. This cycle is often called the business cycle or short-term debt cycle. Inflation usually leads to uncontrolled higher inflation (often called hyperinflation) when part of the demand is speculative or demand that has been advanced earlier than normal, most likely due to very high inflationary expectations (you expect prices to rise a lot and hence buy earlier than you would to save the difference). Thus inflation keeps increasing (as demands keeps increasing) and leads to spiraling hyperinflation. However, even hyperinflation ends at some point, usually with a marked devaluation of the currency causing demand for much costlier imports to plummet.  Zimbabwe and more recently Venezuala are good Work-In-Progress examples of this phenomenon I think. I think the error in your logic supporting your question is the application of the \"multiplier\" effect of money. It is far better to think of demand for any good/service to be based on cash and credit demand. This will help clarify how to think about the business cycle and more. In this context, I would recommend learning about Ray Dalio's model of How the Economic Machine works. Bonus:  if you consider a side question, when can a good or service exhibit only increasing inflation? The answer is when demand growth keeps increasing faster than supply growth. I do not believe we have yet encountered such a good or service. ",

            "answer_text": "Inflation may lead to more inflation depending on how aggregate supply and demand are behaving, and how much confidence investors have in the economy. If you increase interest rates and investors trust that your currency, once hobbled by inflation, is healing, then increasing demand for the currency may stabilize and cap inflation--you may enter a phase of disinflation.  If you have \"fake growth\" happening on the back of gimmicks like quantitative easing and spurring price gains, then nothing guarantees that inflation will become embedded.  Inflation might fall as the central bank begins tapering accomodative lending. Heck, central banks are affraid of increasing interest rates in many countries that seem to suffer from secular stagnation because they don't trust that the inflation they are creating will stick.  Your question is more relevant however in countries where inflation is rampant. In that case yes inflation may suck an economy in a nasty downward spiral and cause high inflation to become customary. When high inflation settles in, several structural reforms will be needed to help the ailing economy, and a country that manages to fall in the inflation trap in the first place may be poorly equipped to escape it. But to answer your question,nothing guarantees that inflation leads to more inflation. ",

Once the prices stabilise to their elevated levels (and unless the central bank keeps injecting liquidity), people cannot keep on demanding more goods since they start to see the new price as normal.
