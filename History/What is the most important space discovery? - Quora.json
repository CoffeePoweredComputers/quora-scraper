The crowded nature of the galaxy\u2019s centre has previously made it difficult to analyse. However, new research of around 10,000 Sun-like stars is now thought to have shed light on the unknown past of the bulge. Annalisa Calamida, from the Space Telescope Science Institute, said: \u201cThere are many theories describing the formation of our galaxy and central bulge. \u201cSome say the bulge formed when the galaxy first formed about 13 billion years ago. \u201cIn this case, all bulge stars should be old and share a similar motion. In this scenario, some of the stars in the bulge might be younger, with their chemical composition enriched in heavier elements expelled from the death of previous generations of stars, and they should show a different motion compared to the older stars.\u201d In an important discovery the new research, based on nine years' worth of archival data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, has found that aspects of both schools of thought are true. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 This analysis can help us in understanding the bulge\u2019s origin.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u201cHubble gave us a narrow, pencil-beam view of the galaxy\u2019s core, but we are seeing thousands more stars than those spotted in earlier studies. \u201cWe next plan to extend our analysis to do additional observations along different sight-lines, which will allow us to make a three-dimensional probe of the rich complexity of the populations in the bulge.\u201d ",
