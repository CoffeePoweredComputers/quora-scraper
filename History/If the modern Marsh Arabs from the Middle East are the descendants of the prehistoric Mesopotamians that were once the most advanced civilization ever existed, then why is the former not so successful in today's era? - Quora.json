            "answer_text": "There is no concrete and objective evidence to state that modern Marsh Arabs are the most direct and primordial descendants of the pre-historic Mesopotamians. It\u2019s just an assumption based on some aspects of their culture (which may be simply a preservation of a way of life that disappeared elsewhere due to climate changes, societal developments, more cosmopolitan and foreign-influenced urban centers, new economic needs etc.). There is literally zero ancient DNA samples from southern and central Mesopotamia at this moment, so the only objective and trustworthy way to really confirm Marsh Arabs are any closer to the ancient Mesopotamians than other Iraqis or even people outside Iraq in the current era. It isn\u2019t yet certain if Mesopotamians south of Assyria (North Iraq) were similar to Northern Mesopotamians or not, or if they were more like ancient North Levantines or South Levantines.  In any case, if they were one of those 3 things, it seems unlikely that the Marsh Arabs are really the closest to the Ancient Mesopotamians, who were in fact a mishmash of several ethnicities that settled in the same land and/or became part of the same and increasingly bigger polities in different periods and quantities (Sumerians, Akkadians, Chaldeans, Kassites, Gutians, Amorites, Persians etc.). So, what ancient Mesopotamians were genetically in 3,000 B.C. was probably a bit different from what they were in 1,500 B.C. and certainly different from what they were in 1 A.D. Marsh Arabs have a prominence of J1-P58, a clade of haplogroup J1 that is deeply tied to the expansion of Semitic languages, so it was probably not a marker of the first civilized people of Mesopotamia (and the world), the Sumerians. Also, they seem to be genetically and phenoypically pretty close to the people of Arabia (where J1-P58 also peaks in frequency). See: (PDF) In search of the genetic footprints of Sumerians: A survey of Y-chromosome and mtDNA variation in the Marsh Arabs of Iraq Large-scale migrations of Arab tribes to what is now Iraq during the Middle Ages are indeed documented, particularly after Mesopotamia became partially depopulated due to the overwhelmingly destructive Mongol invasions there, which may have indirectly caused an eventual permanent genetic change in the entire region. So, it may be that Marsh Arabs are simply Arabians from further south that migrated to Southern Iraq, mixed with locals and adopted their lifestyle and many of their customs. Indeed, the extremely large frequency of one only specific clade of a major haplogroup among them, J1-P58 (~73%), in a region that was historically cosmopolitan and a sort of crossroad between the East and the West seems to point to either a strong local effect (suggesting a more recent expansion from an original tiny population) or a mostly Arabian origin at least on the paternal side of their ancestry. Other alternative explanation is that J1-P58, which is a very ancient clade (time of the most recent common ancestor of that lineage goes up to 9,100 years ago), was not spread just by Semitic speakers, instead it was also or perhaps even mostly linked, in its origins, to Sumerians and peoples related to them that were periodically absorbed by Semitic language and culture and expanded together with them. However, the genetic evidence that the J1-P58 in Marsh Arabs has a remarkably lower variance than in other Middle Eastern and even African and Southern European populations seems to be indicating that there was a (historically) recent expansion among Marsh Arabs, at least on the paternal lineage. Anyway, the best answer is that, right now, there is no way to determine accurately how much Marsh Arabs descend from ancient Mesopotamians, let alone if they descend from the specific Mesopotamian subpopulations that built large cities and developed complex civilizations in that region (for it is clear that at any time in Antiquity, especially in the Near East, which had a profound gap between cities and the remote deserts and grasslands, many areas close to or amidst advanced civilizations were still fully or almost fully agrarian and occupied by poor peasants and herders). When ancient DNA from all of ancient Mesopotamia finally gets extracted and analyzed, we\u2019ll be able to make a better assessment. ",
