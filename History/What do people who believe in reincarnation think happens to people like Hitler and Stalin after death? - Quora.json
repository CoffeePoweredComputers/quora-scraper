Also, I think you have to distinguish between someone his Stalin, who was a brutal dictator, and Hitler, who tried to wipe out an entire race of people. Hitler would probably have to go someplace where he could think about what he did in his previous lifetime. It wouldn't necessary be a place of eternal torment like the Christians believe, but he would definitely need a long time-out. Once he had done that, he would probably be reborn into a life where he could further learn the lessons he needed to learn. He might come back as an immigrant or a member of a minority someplace where those kinds of people are despised, so he would learn first-hand what it feels like to be hated. ",

Six US Presidents Have Destroyed Iraq by Chris Ernesto Posted onJuly 04, 2014 It doesn\u2019t take a PhD in Sociology to conclude that Iraq was better off with Saddam Hussein than it is today. It\u2019s not that Saddam was a great leader without blood on his hands. It\u2019s just that what six US presidents have done to Iraq over the past 35 years has been much worse than anything Saddam ever did to the people of Iraq.
