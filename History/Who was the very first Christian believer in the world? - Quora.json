            "answer_text": "There wasn\u2019t really one, single \u201cvery first Christian\u201d. The Church, as an entity, came into being at Pentecost, after Jesus\u2019 ascension when his disciples were waiting for a sign to begin their ministry. The Holy Spirit descended on them, and that was the birth of the Church. Being as the Church didn\u2019t exist up until that point, I think it would only be fair to say that neither did Christianity, as the Church\u2014by definition\u2014consists of the global community of believers in Christ. Before that point, many theologians consider Christ\u2019s following to be a unique branch within Judaism, but not a distinct religion itself. Now, one could argue that belief in Jesus\u2014rather than being a part of the New Testament era Church\u2014would be the standard by which we define who the \u201cvery first Christian believer\u201d was. In that case, it would probably have been either Adam or Eve. The first reference to the work Christ would do is found in Genesis 3:15 (called the protoevangelion, or the \u201cfirst good news\u201d) as a future hope built into the consequences of Adam and Eve\u2019s original sin.

That's a modern term for a modern religion. Back then it was Jesus, Messenger of God, speaking to those few who could receive his Message. He taught forgiveness, compassion, and the reality of the Holy Spirit. There were no rituals, no churches. No convoluted doctrines. If you want to learn more about the real relationship between Jesus, God, and Christianity you should read the New Message from God. Here is one of the relevant Revelations: Who is Jesus? - The New Message from God ",
