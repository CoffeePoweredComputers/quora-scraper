            "answer_text": "First off, who was Cleopatra?  She was of royal blood. Not only that, but her family was associated with Alexander the Great, a figure that many Romans admired and some even worshiped. Cleopatra was said to be charming and attractive. Of course, she wasn\u2019t a great beauty, but she certainly wasn\u2019t ugly and managed to attract two of the most powerful and desirable men of her age. Let\u2019s see why. Look the people she attracted. The two most famous examples are Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony, both men that desired power and influence. Cleopatra forged political alliances with both, as she was a woman and thus, not the first-in-line for the throne. She was married to her brother, Ptolemy, who was to be the ruling pharaoh of Egypt. Caesar was a ladies man that had a large number of mistresses, including women from notable families. Cleopatra was just one of them. He probably desired to have the ruler of Egypt be loyal to him, personally, rather than to just be a successor, like Ptolemy was. It\u2019s also possible Caesar disliked Ptolemy due to the death of Pompey Magnus. Here, we reach a strange fork in the road. Caesar was in his 50s when he died. We can\u2019t know what his plans were. Would he create the Roman empire in the same way Augustus did or simply retire, like Sulla? Maybe being the de-facto ruler of Egypt would be a good retirement plan. Caesar\u2019s child with Cleopatra could prove to be a good heir, the rightful heir to both the throne of Egypt and Caesar\u2019s fortune and position in Roman society. Mark Anthony was a different beast. With Octavian being the heir to Caesar\u2019s fortune and name, Mark Anthony\u2019s future was left uncertain. He fled to Egypt and made an alliance with Cleopatra, who by then had Caesar\u2019s biological son. The civil war between Octavian and Anthony couldn\u2019t have been won without the support of Egypt. It\u2019s important to note that a big chunk of the Senate supported Mark Anthony over Octavian. Anthony was a proven general and a more experienced man, but no match for Octavian and Agrippa. Also, Anthony claimed Octavian was not the legitimate heir to Caesar\u2019s name or fortune, naming Cleopatra\u2019s son with Caesar the actual heir. That didn\u2019t please Octavian, but it certainly pleased Cleopatra. If Anthony won, he would be the step-father of Caesar\u2019s heir and the most powerful man in Rome, which would make Cleopatra not only the queen of Egypt, but potentially the empress of all Rome. Not bad when you think about it and certainly enough of a reason to make Anthony desire a relationship with her. In the end, both Cleopatra and her son were killed by Octavian, who became the first Roman emperor. ",

            "answer_text": "What made Cleopatra so desirable? Let\u2019s cut the Politically Correct crap and discuss a topic like it\u2019s the 1970\u2019s. There is an advantage to being old enough where I was reading stuff before the age of politic correctness and horse ship pumps at girl power for the sake of it. There\u2019s even some nonsense that she was black or Egyptian making her exotic to the Romans and that she was such a good conversationalist that men found her interesting and charming, men like Marc Anthony and Julius Caesar. Nope, she was what we\u2019d consider a Mediterranean European. Here\u2019s reality. Cleo was ethnically Hellenic Greek, from when the Macedonians took over Egypt and they began running the place. Online: Cleopatra was a pretty much straight line descendant of the original Ptolemy, with no known admixture of native Egyptian blood. She wasn\u2019t black, Arab, Egyptian, or anything else other than Macedonian. If pressed she would have described herself as Hellenic, which had the meaning of \u201cGreek\u201d to us. The Romans knew bright, intelligent and gifted conversationalist women in Rome, and Greeks were hardly exotic to them. So we\u2019ve taken out exotic, we can simply skip the powerful as Caesar and Marc Antony knew powerful women, and we knoiw she wasn\u2019t beautiful, so, What made Cleopatra so desirable? As a high priestess of Aset, As such, Cleopatra knew things about sex that no courtesan of the French Court, no Sultan\u2019s favorite, No Chinese Emperor\u2019s concubine and no seasoned porn star would ever knew. Someone into phallus worship, she could do fellatio with complete, and utter control, at a level lost to the ages. She could arouse someone with impotence and cause a viral man to be ready again in seconds for multi shots a night. She was better than a thou a night escort. [Clean image but it\u2019s hinted at in an old film.]  Julius Caesar   ",
