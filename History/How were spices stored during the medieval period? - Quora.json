            "answer_text": "Spices will stay fresh for up to 4 years (ground spices last from 3\u20134 years and dried leaves last from 2\u20133 years). Different spices are prepared differently, but most would be sun-dried and wrapped into tight rods to minimize the water content and exposure to moisture. They are certainly resilient goods, which is why they were among the few things that were being transported over long distances at the time. The quality of the spice will deteriorate over time, but they would still not spoil or rot quickly (like bread or fruit). In addition, Asian and African spices transported to Europe were being used primarily for medicinal, spiritual and aromatic purposes rather than for flavoring food. If the spices were not absolutely fresh, the customer probably would not even notice.  Spices and other foods transported over long distances have been kept fresh using hessian sacks (burlap sacks) for hundred of years now. They are breathable and resistant to condensation and erosion. I know that they were in use in India since ancient times, however I\u2019m not certain whether they were in use in Europe before the 17th century. If not, the traders probably had something similar. Spice trading long predates the Middle ages and was actually incredibly prominent during the era of the Roman Empire  (the red arrows are the spice routes) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends which part of the medieval period. In the early middle ages, people often didn\u2019t have spices (unless, you lived in Asia or the Middle-East and/or grew them) because trade was minimal, especially in Europe - trade was dangerous. In the late middle ages, I think that is something along what they did, yes. Though I think they\u2019d use crates rather than jars (you can store more in crates, after all) and even then, I doubt they went over sea in Europe. It was dangerous (due to pirate-like ships, Vikings and storms) and long, with a lot of stops in between for food and probably necessary fixing. And boats were hard to build. They probably travelled more by land, with more possibility to stop for food (and trading their spices!) in smaller (or larger) towns and cities. Overall, going over land was much more popular due to the markets they\u2019d come across and it was more easy and affordable. (My answer is not completely reliable - I have NOT studied history enough to know for sure, but this is my best guess based on common sense and knowledge. I hope I helped, but if you want a more reliable answer, I suggest to either do more research yourself or wait for someone to come who has more experience on the matter) ",
