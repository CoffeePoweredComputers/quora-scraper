            "answer_text": "A very simple example of transfer pricing is as follows: Parentco, a fictional U.S. based pen company, manufactures pens in the U.S. at the cost of 10 cents per pen.Parentco's Canadian subsidiary, Subco, sells the pens to Canadian customers for $1 (or 100 cents) per pen and spends 10 cents per pen in distribution and marketing costs.The group's total profit on the sale of each pen is 80 cents (revenue of 100 cents, less cost of 20 cents).Transfer price is the price charged by Parentco to Subco and is likely to somewhere between 20 cents (which will leave all of the profit in Canada) and 80 cents (which will leave all of the profit in the US).Absent any transfer pricing regulations, a profit-maximizing multinational group will look at where the tax rates are lower and seek to put more profit there. In this example, the US tax rate is higher than the Canadian tax rate. Therefore, absent any rules, the multinational is likely to assign the lowest possible transfer price to the sale of pens from Parentco to Subco. Most countries have transfer pricing rules that require that an \"arm's length price\" be charged. An arm's length price is a price that you would expect if Parentco and Subco were not related to each other and actually negotiated. This price is arrived at by looking at market data--either by directly observing the market price charged by manufacturers of pens to distributors of pens, or by looking at margins earned by either the manufacturers or the distributors, taking into account the functions, risks and assets of both parties to the transaction.

            "answer_text": "In technical terms (i.e., IRC 482 and OECD guidelines), transfer pricing is defined as \"...a comparable transaction conducted between two unrelated parties in an uncontrolled environment.\"  In practical terms, the 'transfer price' is the price charged between a parent and a subsidiary for the subsidiary's involvement in getting the product or service to market. The 'transfer price' charged between the two parties is substantiated by the transfer pricing agreement, each entity must have its own agreement as there is no 'one size fits all' for all the circumstances in the parent/subsidiary environment. There are many drivers to creating a TP agreement:1.  Type of services performed by the subsidiary.2.  Legal entity risk distribution3.  Comparable transactions in an uncontrolled environment between two unrelated parties (i.e., related parties arms length transaction)4.  Stage of the contemporaneous documentation in parent and subsidiary. Creating transfer pricing agreements is not an easy task and it depends on both the country in question and their system of law.  For example, in the US we are governed by Common Law whereas on parts of Europe they are governed by Civil Codes of Justice.  The point is, certain TP agreements and the underlying methodology applied are acceptable for one code of law but not another. An example of transfer pricing is a parent company in the US that manufacturers a semi-finished good (\"SFG\") and 'sells' the SFG to a subsidiary in another country where they complete the sales cycle by engaging in defined value added activities to get the product ready for final sale.  The parent charges a mark up on cost and the subsidiary sells to end customer using the marked up value as their cost of inventory. You can examine the regulations (i.e., IRC 482 and OECD guidelines), Wiley publishing has several great texts on international tax (i.e., transfer pricing) such as \"Transfer Pricing Methods\"; \"Transfer Pricing International-Country by Country guide\"; and \"Transfer Pricing International\" all by Robert Feinschreiber. Baker and McKenzie publish a significant amount of material on the topic, the Big Four all have tax departments and teams just dying to jump to your aid for a fee.... ",
