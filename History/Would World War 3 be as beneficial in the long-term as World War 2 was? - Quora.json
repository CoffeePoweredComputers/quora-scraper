            "answer_text": "First, define WWIII. Some people think WWIII is already underway, and it\u2019s only helping the rich and the powerful. If you\u2019re talking about an all-out war between the U.S. and Russia (fat chance) or China (much more likely), then it would probably be far more destructive than WWII. Just think of all the technological advances we\u2019ve made over the past seventy years and all the weapons that are stockpiled around the world. Of course, it\u2019s possible that such a war could be aborted rather quickly. Maybe China would chicken out after losing a couple ships, or the U.S. might sue for peace if China blows up a few hundred bridges and dams and knocks out some computers. Ironically, I personally think WWIII is just about our only hope. The World is going to H*ll, and I don\u2019t know what else is going to break the power of \u201cGlobal Elitists.\u201d I just hope we can survive to pick up the pieces. On a side note, how was WWII \u201cbeneficial\u201d? Over 50 million people died. It was a lucky break for the U.S., because Europe and Japan were bombed into ruins, destroying economic competitors in the process. But it sure wasn\u2019t good for most countries. And how is the U.S. different from Nazi Germany? ",
