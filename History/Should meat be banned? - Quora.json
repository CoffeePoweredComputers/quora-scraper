            "answer_text": "Q:\u201dShould meat be banned?\u201d Meat is the edible, raw or processed muscle tissue of an animal. Technically, the muscle bands of a fish\u2019s lateral sides are meat and even the inner workings of caterpillars are mostly meat. Without the existence of meat, little to no organisms will be able to exist. Those that have evolved to use muscle to their advantage (locomotion, processing it as food, etc.) would die off. Heterotrophs could not move around and would be unable to decompose dead meat from other organisms. Plants, protists, and bacteria that rely on the survival of a meat-bearing creature to survive will die off as well, furthering the destruction of Earth\u2019s food web. Without meat in a human body, they could not survive for long without constant medical assistance. That, of course, will not be possible if we are all just muscle-lacking organs, bones, nerves, and tendons. Banning of meat in the content of banning its consumption is an irrational decision. True, humans partially rely on the consumption of meat from non-human animals to stay alive. We are adaptable, though\u2014some people have developed the technology to give us all of the (known) required nutrients to function properly through IV fluids. However, IV fluid cannot be created or administered by a human without the ability to move themselves around, so our chances of living would drop sharply if meat was banned from existing entirely. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but it should be eaten in moderation. Most people eat far too much meat, which is unhealthy and puts a giant pressure on the earths resources. I am in favor of the meat prices going up. That way, people start eating less meat. Provided that the price difference actually ends up with the farmers and not with the brokering, it would mean they would need to produce less meat and still keep the same income. If less meat is eaten, our footprint on the environment is being reduced significantly. As a bonus, there is room for the farmers to give their animals a better treatment. The only way to achieve this is by government regulation. The government should enforce how much meat is allowed to be produced in order to prevent farmers from flooding the market which would cause prices to drop. We don\u2019t want prices to drop, they should be high in order to discourage meat consumption. Also, the government should implement a system to ensure most of the meat price ends up with the farmers. The market can\u2019t be trusted on that. ",
