            "answer_text": "No! There is no way to measure an \u201coldest\u201d language because all languages[*] are the same age, at least as far as we know. Languages change gradually over time and eventually become unrecognizable, but this is roughly similar (perhaps a slightly different rate) for all languages. They all change. They are all old, because they have histories. Most linguists generally assume that all human languages go back to a single ancestor, but even if language developed multiple times in multiple places, it would have been so far back in prehistory that we probably will never have the evidence to figure it out, and certainly much farther back than \u201cEnglish\u201d and \u201cFrench\u201d are relevant. To track the history of these two languages specifically, French is a Romance language related to Spanish, Italian, Romanian, etc., descended from spoken Latin, and English is a Germanic language related to Dutch, German, Swedish, etc. We don\u2019t have any documents from the ancestor of the Germanic languages, so we refer to it as Proto-Germanic. But going one step further, it turns out that Latin (actually a little farther back, Proto-Italic) and Proto-Germanic were related. They descended from a common ancestor Proto-Indo-European, spoken somewhere in central Eurasia about 6,000\u20139,000 years ago. Now that we\u2019ve established that, you can see how English and French are exactly the same age. We don\u2019t have any clear evidence about what happened before Proto-Indo-European (it probably descended from some other even bigger grouping of ancient languages in Eurasia), and around that time is the earliest we can reconstruct histories for any languages. So Chinese is just as old as French and English too. Another question you might ask is how long these languages have been spoken where they are, or how long they have been called by those names, but those are easily answered by looking up some historical facts. Calling a language \u201cold\u201d in itself is meaningless. It must be qualified in some sense, with some way to determine a year from which to count. Aside from sounding exciting, a general answer to \u201chow old is this language?\u201d is essentially meaningless. [*Some languages actually can be said to be young, because we know when they began. These include some signed languages and many pidgins or creoles (which form as mixtures of other languages), and these are generally not considered to descend directly from any earlier language so they are \u201cnew\u201d and therefore not \u201cold\u201d. Many have clear documented histories. One of the best known and \u201cnewest\u201d is Nicaraguan Sign Language that formed over the last few generations of students at deaf schools in Nicaragua.

            "answer_text": "Is the English language older than the French language? It depends on how you define \u201cFrench.\u201d The history of English begins with the arrival of a Germanic-speaking tribe in an area that spoke a Celtic language. According to Old English - Wikipedia, Old English \u201cwas brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers probably in the mid-5th century, and the first Old English literary works date from the mid-7th century.\u201d According to History of French - Wikipedia, \u201cBefore the Roman conquest of what is now France by Julius Caesar (58\u201352 BC), much of present France was inhabited by Celtic-speaking people referred to by the Romans as Gauls and Belgae.\u201d Then, \u201cFrom the 3rd century on, Western Europe was invaded by Germanic tribes from the north and east, and some of these groups settled in Gaul\u2026. The Frankish language had a profound influence on the Latin spoken in their respective regions\u2026.\u201d However, according to Old French - Wikipedia, \u201cOld French \u2026 was the language spoken in Northern France from the 8th century to the 14th century.\u201d If you count from the first time the parent language was established in the region, French is older. If you count from the first occurrence of a language with the name \u201cEnglish\u201d or \u201cFrench,\u201d English is older. ",
