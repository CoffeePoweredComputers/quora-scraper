            "answer_text": "Yes. The retreat of the Alpine troops during the disastrous Russian campaign was a series of winning disengagement battles: 25, to be precise - the last one at Nikolajewka - to free themselves from the surrounding Russian troops.  The 26th of January 1943, under the lead of General Reverberi (One Gold and three Silver Medals for Military Prowess), the \u201cTridentina\u201d attacks the position of the Russian troops, and breaks out of the encirclement while getting extreme losses (a striking result, and more striking still if we count on the fact that it was obtained by using inferior equipment and against superior odds). There is also a legend about a communiqu\u00e9 of the Russian High Command, stating that the Alpini of the Tridentina have been the only unbeaten military corps in Russia during World War II. Its authenticity is - though - dubious. But still, even if this is only a myth, the retreat of the \u201cTridentina\u201d is one of the biggest military feats of the Italian Army during WWII - even if the concept of a \u201cvictory\u201d during a retreat could strike as something odd. Edit: It has been questioned if this was an \u201cimportant\u201d battle (or series of battles). Please, define \u201cimportant\u201d: the answer comes from your definition. I define it by looking at the facts and numbers. In my humble opinion, winning 25 battles against a superior enemy which is encircling your positions, using inferior arms and equipment, while retreating towards your front, and saving 40.000 soldiers (mostly Italian, Romenian and Hungarian) from capture and imprisonment WAS quite an important feat, and should be noteworthy for any serious WWII military historian/aficionado. Also, do you consider it \u201cwinning\u201d, when your forces were retreating after the Stalingrad defeat? (Stalingrad was probably THE battle that changed the sorts of WWII in Europe). I think that the difference here lies in the outlook you have when considering it. It has been a series of 25 tactical wins under an Italian command, while retreating after a huge strategic loss under German command, in which the absurd directives of Hitler himself played a major part - so, a much smaller scale of engagement. It is your choice. Mine is: was it winning? Yes. Was it important? Yes. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know of any Italian victory's and have tried searching but found nothing. The Italian army was poorly led ill equipped and let down by their leadership. So moral was very low not surprisingly. Mussolini like Stalin had purged his military of competent Generals because he felt they were a threat to his leadership. And filled positions with incompetent yes men. There.s a saying in English Don\u2019t know there ass from there elbow. For those who really haven't a clue. Properly led and equipped there is no reason why the Italian army wouldn't be as good as any other. If not better. POOR LEADERSHIP  Graziani: the butcher of Ethiopia Of all the major military forces involved at the start of World War II, Italy had the by far the least competent high command. Mussolini filled the officer positions with men whose only \"qualification\" was loyalty to Il Duce. Before the start of hostilities, Italy did have some capable generals - especially those who experienced the mistakes made during the First World War. However, things would change once Mussolini attempted to militarize Italy as he would purge the country of anyone whose allegiance was questioned. Many men from titled families, whose ancestors had been fighting for centuries were considered more loyal to the King, and so stripped of their status and given menial positions. Anyone unlucky enough to be more out-spokenly against Mussolini would be sent to the confino and exiled to wastelands like Italy's holdings in Somalia to suffer in the heat. What was left were a group of military commanders short on any talent or innovation, but long on loyalty to Mussolini's long term fascist goals. The Italian navy, with a limited number of fighting ships was handcuffed by extremely conservative approach by its admiralty. Conversely, men like Rodolfo Graziani, the \"Butcher of Ethiopia\" were loyal to Mussolini until the end and would throw his men into fights he knew that they could not win. It would not take long to prove how poorly the high command would lead Italy's troops, and unfairly put into question their bravery. When the poorly led Italian troops were used in conjunction with, or under German forces, they fought considerably better. The Italian forcesthat participated in Hitler's invasion of Russia were known to have fought particularly well, despite facing vastly superior numbers of Soviet troops and harsh weather. In fact, the bravery of the Italian Alpini (mountain troops) and Voloire (horse artillery) regiments during Operation Barbarossa was legendary. Even when the entire offensive started to fail, Radio Moscow was heard to say \"Only the Italian Alpini Corps is to be considered unbeaten on the Russian Front.\" On several occasions these brave men were surrounded by enemy forces, only to successfully battle back to their own lines. Italy's attempt to take over Greece was a complete disaster; Italy was beaten back by the much weaker Greeks into Albania. Once Germany took over the Greece campaign, the Italian forces under their command fought much more effectively than under their own generals, whom they regarded as little more than Mussolini's butchers. POOR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT  The British Army in Italy, in 1944 In truth, Italy seemed uninterested in war from the start. The announcement of Italy's entrance in the War was not met with enthusiasm, but despair. It seemed that only Mussolini and his Fascist cronies were interested in fighting, and so in 1940 Italy started out on the attempt to conquer the Mediterranean with troops that had no faith in their commanders or a desire to fight. The botched attempt to take over Greece was met with a fierce resistance from men fighting for their lives and homeland: the Greeks were ready to die for their freedom; the Italians barely knew what they truly fought for. A willingness to fight and/or a desire to protect your homeland are two factors in warfare that should never be underestimated. History has countless examples of how these factors have turned the tide against vastly superior foes, such as Ancient Greeks defeating the mighty Persian Empire. More recently, it has been shown that modern leaders often do not learn from the past, but are instead doomed to repeat these military blunders. The Soviet defeat in Afghanistan by the Mujahideen, the defeats in Vietnam for both France and the United States and the 2000s war in Iraq are all testaments to how a determined force, willing to fight and die, can often turn the table on what is considered the more powerful force. CONCLUSION  1st armored division passes through ruins of a town south of Bologna, Italy In retrospect, it almost seems that the Italian military was doomed to failure from the start and was thrown into a war that they were not equipped for, nor willing to fight for Mussolini's cronies. The very fact that Italy became an aggressor during the war was solely to appease the arrogance of Mussolini, without a thought to the preparation of the country. The military lacked leadership and modern weapons, yet it was still thrust into battle. When ill-equipped forces of disheartened men were defeated, Il Duce could not see his own mistakes and simply labeled his men as cowards. However, it has been shown that while under command of competent German leadership, Italian troops fought very well - contributing to the final defeat of Greece and acts of great bravery on the Russian front. In conclusion, it was these factors and not cowardice that lead to Italy's poor performance during World War II. The thoughts of one veteran seem to sum up th \"The Italians were smart enough to see that it was a lost cause, in the end Germany would dominate anyway, so why get killed for nothing? It was brains, not cowardice.\" By Justin Demetri ",

            "answer_text": "Greeks Were Annihilated During 2nd Spring Offensive On 12 April 1941, after the failure of the Yugoslav-Greek offensive (Plan R-41) to expel the Italian Army in Albania, the Greek Army attempted to retreat from Albania. At the time, General Ugo Cavallero had launched his Second Spring Offensive. There were not many route options that ran between Albania and Greece to stage a large-scale military retreat. As a result, the bulk of the 14 Greek divisions deployed months earlier to seize Albania were now crowded along the few highways that lead out of the country and into Greece\u2014the main one being on the P\u00ebrmeti-Perati mountain pass. Bersaglieri and Alpini spearheads near P\u00ebrmet soon reported that the Greeks were packing up, and Albanian civilians told Italian commanders that their their countrymen were not be among the traffic leaving. So, the Regia Aeronautica felt it could engage freely, with the Royal Air Force also having ceased contesting control of Albanian airspace. Then the Italian Stukas\u2014nicknamed 'Picchiatello' in Italian service\u2014reported solid intelligence. What appeared on their gun cameras confirmed a huge enemy convoy traveling south, leaving P\u00ebrmet City and heading toward Perati Bridge, situated in Greece\u2019s northern border with Albania. All available fighter and bomber squadrons were ordered towards the three several miles long convoy of armor, trucks, buses and stolen civilian vehicles. The weather was an issue at the time, and visibility was made worse by the hundreds of mountain-top heavy machinegun positions set by the Greek units during their retreat. Sparviero bombers that were patrolling the Albaniani coastline were first on the scene and armed ideally for the grim job at hand. The Sparvieros aimed at the front and rear of the convoy retreating from Porto Palermo. Flights of Picchiatello dive-bombers were especially deadly, flying below the weather and expending all their bombs and cannon ammunition during multiple attack runs. The stretch of the P\u00ebrmeti-Perati highway was worked over by Italian Stukas for seven days straight. Hundreds of vehicles, including some of the 130 Italian tankettes and armored cars in Greek service, were pummeled into unrecognizable heaps of mangled steel. In the meantime, Bersaglieri and Alpini units were busy rolling up Greek Army rearguards via the mountain route, although not in such a spectacularly successful way as the Italian divisions near the Albanian coastline. In all, at least many hundreds but possibly thousands of Greeks were killed during the Italian blitzkrieg, and hundreds or thousands of vehicles were destroyed or abandoned as well, not including Greek casualties in the ground fighting. Bentio Mussolini stated the following about the Second Spring Offensive/Battle of Perati Bridge a week after it occurred: \u201cAfter six months of most sharp fighting, the enemy has laid down his arms. The victory consecrates your bloody sacrfices, especially severe for the land forces, and illuminates your flags with new glory. The fatherland is proud of you as never before.\u201d It is widely known that the battle that occurred on the \u201cHighway of Death\u201d was a major factor in General George Tsolakoglou ending all Greek resistance on 21 April, while the bulk of the Greek Army was still trapped in Albania. Today the Second Spring Offensive remains one of the most powerful examples of Italian Army prowess and good application of air power on the part of the Regia Aeronautica. It also remains one of the bloodiest Italian victories in World War II that some foolish armchair generals would argue did not take place.  ",

The Italians were unable to successfully invade and hold Ethiopia. Ethiopians with almost no modern Weaponry of any kind, repeled them repeatedly. This was enough proof to Hitler that Mussolini's men were by no means a consistent Ally to be used in many future endeavors. The truth is the Italians could have majorly helped in many areas where the Germans were lacking. Not having them in those positions helped the Allies win the war. They could have served in the same capacity as some of the local militia in the Napoleonic Wars and slowed down many Allied invasions giving the Germans time to regroup. ",

            "answer_text": "The Italian navy was very good, crippled more by lack of fuel than lack of spirit or skill. In terms of \u201cbattles\u201d, notably, they stopped the HARPOON/VIGOROUS convoy getting through to Malta in early 1942. This involved a squadron-sized naval battle with Italian cruisers beating the British Royal Navy and getting through the escort to sink several merchant ships. This created a huge supply crisis, and destroyed the ability of the island to operate as an offensive base, enabling the Afrika Korps to push deep into Egypt. It\u2019s also worth noting that a huge amount of Rommel\u2019s troops in africa were Italian, and despite the unfair historiography, deserve an equal share in most of the \u201cGerman\u201d desert victories.
