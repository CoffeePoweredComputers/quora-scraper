            "answer_text": "How was society structured in ancient India before Shewetaketu invented the institution of marriage? In ancient India, the institution of marriage was not in vogue. In procuring a partner for connubial union man demonstrated the same behavioral activity which is adopted by the animal class. This psychology of the ancient society brought in uncertainty about the paternity of children. sooner or later man\u2019s quest for paternity of children went on and this sowed the seed of marriage as an institution. Indian mythology maintains that svetaketu, son of the sage Uddalak, was the first man to introduce the institution of marriage. A legend goes, as to how the institution of marriage was created. There was a sage called Uddalaka. He had a son called Swetaketu. Swetaketu was a small boy aged about eight or 10 years. Uddalaka was making morning oblations to the Sun God. His wife was supplying water to him. While the oblations were continuing, another Brahmin came and made a proposition to the lady that they should go together for sexual intercourse and the lady readily agreed. The boy was taken aback and Swetaketu told his father: \"How is it that you have allowed my mother to go with another man?\" The father, Uddalaka says: \"Boy, that is the rule of the land.\" But Swetaketu did not agree. At a later stage, he became a great sage. He wrote an Upanishad also and he propounded the first theory of Uddalaka-Swetaketu principles wherein adultery was prohibited. As can be seen from above, that an adulterous woman, was what prompted the creation of the institute of marriage. Also, it was initiated by a son, who wanted his parents to stay with him. However, when he drafted the laws, he didn't get prejudiced and made the law gender-neutral, i.e. he forbade adultery by both the husband and wife. ",
