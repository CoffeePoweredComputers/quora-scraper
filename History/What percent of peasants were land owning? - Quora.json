            "answer_text": "With the usual caveats about the Middle Ages lasting a thousand years and the term referring to entities as different as Iceland and Sicily, the Hansa Cities and the Italian Communes: None. In feudal societies there was no capitalist concept of land ownership at all. Barons, lords and knights did not own the land either. They held it in fief from the king. Renowned French historian Regine Pernoud points out in her book Those Terrible Middle Ages: Debunking the Myths (Ignatius, 1977, p.88): It was this intimate connection between man and the soil on which he lived that constituted serfdom, for, in all other respects, the serf had all the rights of a free man: he could marry, establish a family, his land, as well as the goods he was able to acquire, would pass to his children at his death. The lord, let us note, had, although on a totally different scale, the same obligations as the serf, for he could neither sell nor give up his land nor desert it. If your question is about the average size of a peasant holding, that depends entirely on the region (Iceland? Poland? Sicily? Hungary? Cyprus? Aragon?) and the period (what part of that one thousand years of history we call the Middle Ages) you are talking about. ",
