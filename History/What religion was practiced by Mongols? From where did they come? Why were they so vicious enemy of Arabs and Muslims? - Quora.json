            "answer_text": "The most typical religion of the Mongols was Tengrism, a shamanic faith, however they were relatively tolerant of other beliefs, as Tengrism wasn\u2019t particularly interested in proselytizing. There were many within the Mongol empire, both subjects and other Mongols, that were Christian, Buddhist, and Muslim. As the name suggests, they were originally from Mongolia, Basically North of China. The Mongols primary beef with the Arabs and Muslims was after Genghis Khan, having come into contact with the Sunni Muslim, Khwarezmian Empire in Persia, tried to send a merchant contingent to the Sultan to expand Silk road trading that way. His previous conquests had mostly focused on the Steppes and China, and he was interested in trade to help fuel his growing empire. The Shah, having heard of the Mongol\u2019s conquests, thought that the merchants were actually a cover to prepare to invade his land and had his governor arrest them. Genghis sent envoys to try and smooth things over, but the Shah had them executed, along with the merchants. Genghis Khan responded by invading the Khwarezmian Empire, completely annihilating many of their cities. Once they had a foothold in the area, they basically just started doing the same thing they did previously, sending their armies hither and yon and demanding the local rulers to submit and give tribute or be destroyed. The Abbasid Caliphate was one of those that were destroyed. They basically just continued doing that until they actually started losing against the Mamluks in Egypt and Syria, effectively ending their conquests in the Middle East. It should be noted however that the Il-Khanate that established itself around Mongol rule in the Middle East was actually made up of Muslim Mongols. So I wouldn\u2019t say there was any particular enmity they felt towards the locals, at least not compared to any of the other peoples they massacred ",

            "answer_text": "The Mongols practiced Tengrism and Shamanism and they originally came from Mongolia, North of China.  They weren\u2019t particularly vicious to Arabs and Muslims because of their ethnicity or religion. They were vicious to anyone who refused to submit. Equally, if a city accepted Mongol rule, they would be left alone as long as they paid their taxes, troop levy and swore vassalage. The Mongol practise of making pyramids or walls out of the skulls of their victims was not in order to punish, but meant as a warning to those who may be thinking of resisting Mongol rule. ",
