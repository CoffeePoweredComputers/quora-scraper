            "answer_text": "A few can if your lucky. .44 mag has taken many Grizzly\u2019s, but you\u2019d be a fool to hunt one with a .44 mag. More than a couple people have died trying to take out a Grizzly with a .44 mag or fatally wounded the Grizzly before the Grizzly fatally wounded them. A .50 mag would fare a little better than a .44 mag. The 50 AE is really similar to the .44 mag in ballistics and should be a reasonable weapon against a Grizzly. Though I\u2019m unaware of this actually happening yet. The 454 Casull is another solid choice as a back up gun against a Grizzly. The next tier down would be .357 mag, .41 mag and 10 mm. These can with excellent shot placement or luck kill a grizzly but the odds are against you. However at least you stand a chance. The next tier down is you MIGHT kill the bear while it\u2019s chewing on you but your not stopping it with this gun. The .45 acp, .40 S&W and .357 sig fall into this category. Anything less than that you want to try to shoot the bear\u2019s eyes and nose out and run. The only way your killing a bear with a 9mm is if they choke on it. A .38 special if your lucky you scare the bear away with the sound, or as the FB meme goes, an angry bear will kill you faster. Even in +P with 9mm or .38 special you will not penetrate bone or deep enough into soft tissue to kill the bear. Your only real choice is point blank into the mouth up into the brain and trying to make a shot like that while the bear is batting you around and chewing on you is rather unlikely. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. The .44 Magnum was originally designed for bear hunting, and has been an excellent choice for this purpose. Many hunters have successfully one shot dropped bear with cartridges like the .44 Magnum out of 6\u2033 barrel or longer revolvers, like the N Frame Smith and Wesson! Edit: I also strongly suggest you study the anatomy of a bear, any animal really, before you decide to hunt one. It doesn't matter if you use a .22lr or a .600 nitro Express, shot placement is everything! A .22lr to the temple may just kill a bear if it zings around in its noggin enough, but an elephant gun hitting it in the leg is just going to give you a very angry, scared, wounded animal! ",

But the smallest caliber I would be comfortable with would be a .45\u201370, and I\u2019d strongly prefer a .375 magnum rifle with a 300gr bullet. ",
