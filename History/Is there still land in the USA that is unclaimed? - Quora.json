            "answer_text": "Once upon a time there was land. It belonged to everyone and no one. Then we got people, and they began to claim the land, even from those who used to previously. Then we go government who regulated taking the land, including taking land itself. Once there was enough people and enough government, all the land was gone and since no more new land is being created, there is no more free land. Still, once upon a time, people who took land sometimes, abandoned the land. This abandoned land was free for the taking, until government decided that abandoned land was valuable and therefore they would take it. Still some abandoned land can be obtained from the government, but really there isn't much of it. So no Virginia, there is no more free land. There is a minor amount of free land left in the world. Mostly places no one wants. Marie Byrd Land and Bir Tawil Triangle are the only two land areas on Earth not claimed by any country. Marie Byrd Land is in Antarctica and Bir Tawil is near Sudan. It is possible that there is an undiscovered land mass in our oceans - possible but not likely. It is also possible that new land could be created in the ocean as a result of volcanic activity. Finally, claiming land would be the easy part. Getting the rest of the world and the UN to recognize the claim is another matter. Lack of recognition is like peeing your pants while wearing a dark suit. It gives you a warm feeling inside, but no one notices. ",

            "answer_text": "Under provisions of the Mining Act of 1872, it is still possible to obtain a patent on a commercially viable mining claim staked on land under the jurisdiction of the BLM.  I believe this applies to land managed by the USFS as well, but of that I am not certain. Patents are not as easily obtained today as in the past but are still theoretically possible.  Older patents were 10.66 acres in size and these parcels account for most of the remote home and cabin sites found throughout the Rocky Mountains and the Sierras. Once a patent is obtained the owner is allowed to use the land as they see fit. So yes, there is still land that is unclaimed in the USA, and obviously there are still homesteading opportunities in Alaska for those who are truly capable of surviving and thriving in a wilderness setting.
