            "answer_text": "The British Empire in India was created when the prime minister Robert Disraeli announced Queen Victoria as Empress of India on the 1st May 1876. Therefore Queen Victoria would be the founder. However, if you wanted to know who is responsible for consolidating a British hold over India then that would be Lord Robert Clive whose victory at the Battle of Plassey on the 27th June 1757 won the British East India company a foothold which allowed them to slowly gain control of the whole nation over the next 100 years. A final answer would be that the British empire in India was founded in August 1858 with the passing of the government of India act which abolished the EIC and established British Governmental rule throughout the Indian territories.
