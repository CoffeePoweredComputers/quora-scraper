            "answer_text": "At least in the U.S. military, you can\u2019t have already served in a foreign military to serve. It\u2019s a policy you find out about with a little bit of research before joining. You also can\u2019t have been part of the Peace Corps, either. Not sure if these are waiverable requirements, however. I imagine the U.S. would still want to recruit anyone that has valuable skills if they can also be proven trustworthy and physically/mentally qualified, but really, if you know someone high enough you could probably get away with just about anything.

Usually that have to have lived in the UK for 5 years before applying but these rules occasionally get bent. We don\u2019t take people from the middle bit of that continent though. ",
