            "answer_text": "Flippant answers are very tempting here, such as the action of a bullet on a cranium, etc. but I will avoid that as in bad taste\u2026 To understand why there was a conspiracy against Lincoln, it\u2019s helpful to keep in mind that almost to the end of his life and his presidency, Lincoln was considered a gangly, rustic, poorly educated country bumpkin of the times, who had assumed great powers far beyond his reach. As shown in Spielberg\u2019s movie (based on Doris Kearn Goodwin\u2019s Team of Rivals), Lincoln was very much self-educated, but he had not been to any of the great universities, such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, or indeed any university at all. He won the Republican convention not on the first ballot, but through a fluke, as he emerged as a kind of second-choice compromise while Henry Seward\u2019s star faded. And if Lincoln was so disliked by many Northerners, imagine how he was regarded in the South! Lincoln, after all, was a complex figure. I accept he absolutely believed in what he said, about \u201cgovernment for the people, by the people, of the people\u2026\u201d but in protecting his concept of democracy and republican government, he had to temporarily stretch the Constitution to the breaking point. He suspended habeas corpus on his own authority. He imposed martial law throughout the South. Above all, the Emancipation Proclamation \u2014 although we today see it as his greatest act \u2014 was seen as a tyrannical act by die-hard supporters of the Confederate States. Although the 13th Amendment was duly passed, eventually, the Emancipation Proclamation was seen as the single handed act of a \u201ctyrant,\u201d a military dictator who imposed his will on the South through the power of Commander in Chief. It\u2019s how people like John Wilkes Booth saw him. And consider John Wilkes Booth himself. He came from America\u2019s leading theatrical family. He never became a great interpreter of the role of Hamlet, like his brother\u2026 so he instead sought to seek fame on the stage of history that had eluded him on the legitimate stage. The result was tragic for both Booth and for President Lincoln. ",

            "answer_text": "Assassins were motivated by the white supremacist belief that slavery was part of the natural order of things. It was considered that slavery was the southern way of life. They believed that drastic action must be taken if slavery was to be preserved. So, Abraham Lincoln, the then President of the Union was assassinated. In 1865 the United States had been struggling through four violent years of civil war, ever since eleven Southern states had decided to secede and form the Confederacy in an effort to preserve the practice of slavery. For four bloody years, Confederate and Union forces had been engaged in brutal combat, while the Union president, Abraham Lincoln, continued to hold on to his hopes for reunification. That April, Lincoln\u2019s hopes seemed about to come true; an end to the bloodshed was finally in sight. However, the end of the Civil War was the beginning of the assassination plots against Abraham Lincoln. There were so many angry Southerners that some people believed it was only a matter of when, not if, the president would be assassinated. One such Southerner was John Wilkes Booth. In Washington, there was indeed cause for celebration, but Abraham Lincoln knew that a great challenge lay ahead: to heal the wounded nation and bring the Southern states back into the Union. This was nearly as great a challenge for Lincoln as the war had been. The Northerners wanted some form of retributive justice, and the Southerners directed more anger and resentment toward Lincoln than any president had ever received before. But this was nothing new for Lincoln, who\u2019d been receiving death threats since his first days as president. Some assassination attempts came in the form of fruit baskets that had been sent to the White House. There was a significant attempt in 1861, known as the Baltimore plot. The conspirators came from a group called the Knights of the Golden Circle, and their plan was to shoot Lincoln before his first inauguration. In April of 1865, there were at least four different conspiracies involving the president. Two groups were hatching plots to kidnap Lincoln, one group wanted to infect one of the president\u2019s dress shirts with yellow fever and the fourth plot was to kill him by planting a bomb in the White House. John Wilkes Booth was originally part of a kidnapping conspiracy, but after two failed attempts to capture the president, he was now part of a new plan to shoot the man dead. Finally, John Wilkes Booth assassinated Lincoln at the Ford\u2019s Theater on April 14, 1865. At 7:21 the next morning, Lincoln took his last breath.  ",
