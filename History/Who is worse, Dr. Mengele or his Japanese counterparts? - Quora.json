            "answer_text": "Thanks for the request. Although both are equally just awful I would say the Japanese with Unit 731 was worse. Mengele\u2019's research was very, very twisted but he had the excuse that it was for \u2018science\u2019. Mengele managed to maim and mutilate over 2,000 twins and countless more individuals in such experiments. This included poisoning, dye in the eyes, missing limbs, left outside in the Polish cold naked (hypothermia experiment), heat lamps and his general presence in the camps. This didn't include his involvement in selections which could be thousands of people a day. These all sound awful but compared to Unit 731 it's nothing. Unit 731 was led under the command of Shir\u014d Ishii that focused on human experimentation in the biological sense as well as chemical warfare. From 1935\u20131945 it is estimated that 3,000 lives were taken. Diseases were deliberately infected to people like the Plague, hyperthermia experiments were done, people were dissected whilst alive and were treated like dogs, explosives were used on people, humans were pushed to the physical limits in pressure chambers until eyes were popped and so, so many more. WARNING! GRAPHIC CONTENT AHEAD! This will show a few images of what was created from these atrocities. Josef Mengele      Shir\u014d Ishii      These two men have one thing in common. They never faced trial, they escaped. Mengele was on the run to Argentina under an alias where he died from a stroke whilst swimming in 1979. For Ishii? OH BOY! Ishii and his colleagues were given immunity by the Soviets in exchange for the information on his experiments. This was almost a copy cat of America\u2019s immunity plan called Operation Paperclip that granted Nazi members immunity if they provided the US with information for their weapons. Ishii even went to the US. He too escaped prosecution as he died of throat cancer in 1959. Fun fact: Mengele managed to go into Germany during the 1950s UNDER HIS REAL NAME. ",

            "answer_text": "That is an interesting question. Mengele is probably the most famous psychopathic doctor in the history of the world. But i don\u2019t believe he was the most psychopathic doctor in history. That dubious honor goes to Dr. Shiro Ishi, Commander of Unit 731. They are almost unknown in history, Japan only officially admitted their existence in 1981, but they were history\u2019s greatest collection of Psycopath\u2019s. Imagine if you will an entire unit staffed by several hundred Mengele-type doctors, and you will start to understand the horror that was Unit 731. Everything from torture, to human experimentation, to testing of biological and chemical weapons was done. Dr. Ishi could give lessons to Mengele. So without question, Unit 731 was much worse than Mengele. ",
