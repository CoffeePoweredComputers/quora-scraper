The traditional punishment was decimation. Then they had to sleep outside the camp. Then they were fed barley instead of wheat. Poor Roman citizens got an alimentum of wheat. ",

            "answer_text": "I have read that the staple of their diet often consisted of barley. This was often made into a thick soup and provided the high calorie content necessary for a fighting man. These men were built for survival and were often in good condition and even on the heavy side. The better conditioned fighter lived longer at their trade; this being beneficial to both fighter (duh!) and empire cost wise. Barley was also a relatively cheap commodity being grown locally and making beef a luxury to most fighting men. ",
