            "answer_text": "TLDR: To control the population they kept guns, but restricted their use. Samurai alone kept swords. So, here\u2019s a quick and dirty answer from memory, as I don\u2019t have the time to delve into facts to pad out my answer. Mid 16th century, Japanese acquire matchlock firearms (arquebus/hackbut) from Portuguese and Dutch merchants. Japan is a fractured country in perpetual internal war at that time. It is quickly realised that any peasant can be trained to fire a matchlock in short order, although their use is considered \u2018dishonourable\u2019 as they don\u2019t require as much face-to-face bravery and skill as traditional hand weapons. However, peasants have no honour, so, meh. Thousands of guns are made in Japanese armouries, to simplified, uniquely Japanese designs based on the imported European models. Thousands of peasants and samurai are taught how to fire them. During the wars, several families grow stronger and cement their power through inter-clan marriages and adoption. It is possible for a peasant soldier to become a great general through vassalage to a powerful family. One peasant-turned-general rises to rule the whole nation, and in order to secure his power, he disarms the peasantry (to be fair, this had also been done by the previous ruler, mostly targeting religious mobs - it seems to be par for the course as a newly installed and somewhat paranoid leader). With the end of the civil wars, there were a good deal of unemployed samurai and former peasant soldiers wandering around causing trouble. He sent many of the former off to try to conquer Korea (for which guns were a war-winning wonder weapon), and disarmed any of the latter who stayed behind. Turn of the century, the generalissimo dies and a new dynasty is triumphant, uniting Japan under their clan\u2019s lord, who acts as the de-facto ruler (shogun), with the emperor reduced to a largely impotent figurehead. The previous sword-hunt edicts remain, and during his rule, and that of his descendants, the classes are fixed and codified to prevent the kind of social mobility that created the conditions for low-born individuals to rise to power. Swords (and various pole-arms) are now the sole right of Samurai to bear. Japan closes its doors to the outside world and no longer needs large armies, a navy, or indeed modern weapons. Guns remain an expensive hand-made curiosity for wealthy Samurai, and arsenals no longer mass-manufacture them now that there are no wars to fight. 150 years ago, Japan was forced to open up to the West, and realising how far they\u2019d been left behind since the 1600s, they underwent an express industrial revolution and quickly developed a modern, Western-trained military, complete with guns and everything. The military government was replaced by a parliamentary government and to emasculate the Samurai class, and nip rebellion in the bud, they were forbidden from carrying swords (except as officers in the military, and even then the swords were styled after Western sabres).
