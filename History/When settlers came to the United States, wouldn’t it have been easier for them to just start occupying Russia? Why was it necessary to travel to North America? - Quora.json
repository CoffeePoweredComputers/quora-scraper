            "answer_text": "Er, that\u2019s exactly what happened. Russia expanded eastwards into Siberia and Central Asia at more or less the same time Western Europeans started to colonise North America, and with similar techniques of colonial settlement and subversion/resettlement of native tribes. And the Russians invited and allowed Central Europeans, particularly Germans, to settle in Russian territory, so you got Mennonites in Pennsylvania, and settled on the Volga for example. One of the great unreported horrors at the end of WW2 was the forced \u201crepatriation\u201d of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, people who hadn\u2019t actually lived in Germany for hundreds of years. For Western Europeans, a sea voyage to America was less of an ordeal than a land/river voyage to the Russian Steppe, and with far less cultural acclimatization involved. ",

            "answer_text": "Russia almost always was known for harsh winters and lack of infrastructures. The European part was more or less civilized thanks to Peter the Great but the rest was really wild and uneducated. Even if today someone will be offered free land in far east I think he or she will pass. US however was created mainly based on European laws (municipal at least) and East coast was not much different from Europe itself. Conquering the west was different story, called gold rush. People in search of free land with gold in mind conquered the West coast. If you look at California\u2019s nature and weather it is very close to perfect (for me at least). ",

Hard work in Russia only got you more hard work, oppression from the Tsarist Okhrana (secret police). If you were Jewish, there were periodic pogroms.
