            "answer_text": "War in the East was officially announced to be the \u201cVernichtungskrieg\u201d, i.e. \u201cWar of annihilation\u201d by Hitler, who demanded Germans to fight with never before seen cruelty. Hitler wanted lands and not the people. Hitler threw 6.5\u20137million troops out 9.5 million strong armies he had under his command in a nasty surprise attack against yet unmobilized Red Army which had only 2 million troops stretched along 2000km of border.. Despite Stalin and Soviet command being in full steam preparation mode to imminent invasion USSR was strategically disadvantaged because Germany was at war already and had the excuse to keep a large mobilized battle ready army. Any Soviet knee jerk mobilization could result in USA taking the opposing side. So Wehrmacht advances to Moscow, banks of Volga and Caucasus. Kicking them out with 20% of available pre war industrial might and half the population still under Soviet control is both a mission impossible and a must do. At this point Axis population was 145 million people, and population remaining under Soviet control only 105 out of 190million of pre war population. Besides Germans had entire Europe and half of USSR working for him sparing extra soldier for draft. (extra 500 million people or so).. so by 1942 we have maybe up to 600 million Axis vs 105 million remaining Soviets. Suddenly Red Army starts kicking ass.. before Lend-lease, second front or any significant contribution from the allies. Up to this point USA not willing to anger winning Germans, have become cautious of winning Soviets and finally Lend-lease kicks in and Invasion from the Atlantic doesn\u2019t seem impossible, since Wehrmacht is throwing itself under Red steam roller. In warfare you throw resources into plugging gaps and Soviet front draws a lot more resources. German divisions get relocated from the western front to eastern front to slow down Soviet advance. German soldiers had a pretty good idea on the scale of the crimes they had in USSR and were scared of retribution. Thus US advance was actually a good thing. Not that they didn\u2019t fight to negotiate, but still. ",

            "answer_text": "The sheer size of the theater demanded enormous armies which were then locked in a  war of savage extermination. On the Soviet side, there was no regard for the lives of their own soldiers. Stalin understood that manpower was the one area in which the Red Army had a decisive advantage over the highly professional German Wehrmacht, and he didn't hesitate to leverage that advantage. German commanders were less careless with the lives of their soldiers but, even so, by the end of the war 4 out of every 5 German soldiers killed during WWII died on the Eastern Front. The war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was unprecedented in both geographic scale and human suffering. ",
