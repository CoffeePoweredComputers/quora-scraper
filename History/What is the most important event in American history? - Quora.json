            "answer_text": "The Battle of Antietam September 4, 1862, the American Civil War has been raging for a little over a year and Robert E. Lee has launched his invasion of Maryland. He was appointed commander of the Army of Northern Virginia three months prior and the newspaper had labeled him Granny Lee thinking he would be timid not attack the Union. In that time he defend the Confederacy\u2019s capital of Richmond, defeated George McClellan, Commanding General of the Union Army, at Seven Days Battles, and John Pope at the Second Battle of Bull Run or Manassas removing the Union from Virginia, his home state.  Robert Edward Lee in 1864 Lee\u2019s goals were to bring the war out of Virginia and to achieve a decisive victory over the North in hopes that the already demoralized Union will lose the will to fight. Others believed that a victory would cause European nations to recognize the Confederacy, but Lee did not see Europe being the cause for Southern victory. If he were to stay in Virginia the Union army could reorganize with their superior numbers and supplies and attack the war exhausted state again. He would have to response to their moves where as going on the offense they would have to instead. He also hoped that the Border States, Maryland being one of them, would join the Confederacy if his campaign was successful and with the Congressional Elections, having more pro-peace Democrats elected. It was just as much a political move as a military one.  Confederate sympathizers engaging Massachusetts militia during the Baltimore Riots of 1861. Crossing the Potomac River with 55,000 men, who were in desperate need of food and supplies, Lee advanced unopposed to Fredrick, Maryland. When news hit Washington DC that a rebel army had invaded things turned chaotic. Pope\u2019s failure at Bull Run cost him command and his forces were places under George McClellan, despite his other failures as a commander, was good at training and organizing soldiers. Lincoln gave him command over the fortifications of Washington DC to the horror of his Cabinet who signed a petition declaring, \"our deliberate opinion that, at this time, it is not safe to entrust to Major General McClellan the command of any Army of the United States\u201d. Lincoln knew there was no other man who could do it, his soldiers adored him and would fight for him, the problem was he was too cautious to ever order them to. If Lincoln were to dispose of McClellan, the moral of the army would plummet and he was a Democrat who had friends in Congress who\u2019s support Lincoln needed.  George McClellan in 1861 Lee\u2019s hopes that Maryland would join the Southern cause were never fulfilled, some even took up arms against the invaders. Lee also assumed that garrisons at Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry, where he put down John Brown\u2019s raid just three years ago, would be abandoned, but they were ordered to remain at their post, isolated. Knowing McCellan would move slowly, Lee decided to divide his forces into four parts and sent Stonewall Jackson to attack Harpers Ferry while the rest of his forces moved to Boonsboro. On September 12, McClellan had made it to Fredrick. He had no idea what Lee\u2019s intentions were and even believed that his army reached 120,000 men strong. However, the next day Union picked up one of the most important piece of paper I believe in American history that decide the fate of this nation, that allowed an overly cautious general to defeat one of the greatest military minds from the US. Special Order 191, was written by Lee for his subordinates detailing his campaign strategy. When McClellan got hold of it he exclaimed, \u201c\"Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I will be willing to go home.\u201d  Special Order 191 However, even with this information McClellan delayed any action for almost a day. Knowing the danger that Harpers Ferry faced, he marched his army to relieve them. Surprised by McClellan\u2019s aggressive actions, Lee ordered men to defend the three passes of South Mountain, Crampton's, Turner's, and Fox\u2019s Gaps, that he would have to pass to get to Harpers Ferry. McClellan was victorious on September 14, but did little the next day leaving Harpers Ferry to fall to Jackson. Lee, who believed that his campaign had failed before news of Jackson\u2019s victory, regrouped his forces at Sharpsburg, west of the Antietam Creek.  Thomas Jonathan \"Stonewall\" Jackson in 1863 On September 17, 1862 from first light at 5:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon, two armies , 87,000 Union and 38,000 Confederate, clashed. What resulted was the bloodiest single day in US history, with more than 22,000 causalities. Lee\u2019s forces would have be destroyed if not for reinforcements from Harpers Ferry and McClellan not using his entire army. This left the battle in a standstill, but Lee retreated the following day. McClellan followed slowing and did not cross the Potomac to fight Lee and his Maryland Campaign ended September 20, a Union victory. His defeat at Antietam led to several events that would cause a Union victory for the entire war. Given several opportunities to destroy Lee\u2019s army, but proving to cautious to do so, McClellan was relieved of command on November 7, though it would be some time before Lincoln could find the right general, McClellan\u2019s removal was needed. The war would drag on for almost three more year. Lincoln had drafted a document that would call for the freedom of all slaves in the states in rebellion, but he was advised that he had to do after a victory or it would seem as an act of desperation. On September 22, Lincoln announced his plan and the next year, January 1, 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation came into effect. Lee\u2019s defeat and the issue of slavery being brought into the war officially ruined any hopes of Britain or France recognizing the nation.

            "answer_text": "I'm not sure that this qualifies as a significant event but in the mid 1700's much of the United States was owned by France. Please refer to the map below.

It was done in part to end the seven years war with the French and the natives which had help from Spain.  Exchange of territories During the war, Britain had conquered the French colonies of Canada, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Lucia, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago, the French \"factories\" (trading posts) in India, the slave-trading station at Gor\u00e9e, the S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River and its settlements, and the Spanish colonies of Manila (in the Philippines) and Havana (in Cuba). France had captured Minorca and British trading posts in Sumatra, while Spain had captured the border fortress of Almeida in Portugal, and Colonia del Sacramento in South America. In the treaty, most of these territories were restored to their original owners. Britain however made considerable gains.[3]  France and Spain restored all their conquests to Britain and Portugal. Britain restored Manila and Havana to Spain, and Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Lucia, Gor\u00e9e, and the Indian factories to France. In return, France ceded Canada, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago to Britain. France also ceded the eastern half of French Louisiana to Britain; that is, the area from the Mississippi River to the Appalachian Mountains.[4]  Spain ceded Florida to Britain. France had already secretly given Louisiana to Spain in the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762). In addition, while France regained its factories in India, France recognized British clients as the rulers of key Indian native states, and pledged not to send troops to Bengal. Britain agreed to demolish its fortifications in British Honduras (now Belize), but retained a logwood-cutting colony there. Britain confirmed the right of its new subjects to practice the Catholic religion.[5] France ceded almost all of its territory in mainland North America, but retained fishing rights off Newfoundland and the two small islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, where it could dry that fish. In turn France gained the return of its sugar colony, Guadeloupe, which it considered more valuable than Canada.[6] Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763) Louis XV preferred to keep La Guadeloupe which was known for its spices rather than keep the territories in La Nouvelle France. It is rumoured that he is quoted as saying: \" Je ne me batterai pas pour des bancs de neige.\" Translated in English, it means: \"I will not fight for snow banks.\" Here is what I believe to be a good source but it is in French.  http://www.herodote.net/histoire/evenement.php?jour=17630210 Then in 1803 there was the Louisiana Purchase.   France controlled this vast area from 1699 until 1762, the year it gave the territory to its ally Spain. Under Napoleon Bonaparte, France took back the territory in 1800 in the hope of building an empire in North America. A slave revolt in Haiti and an impending war with England, however, led France to abandon these plans and sell the entire territory to the United States who had originally intended only to seek the purchase of New Orleans and its adjacent lands.The purchase of the territory of Louisiana took place during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. At the time, the purchase faced domestic opposition because it was thought that it was unconstitutional. Although he agreed that the U.S. Constitution did not contain provisions for acquiring territory, Jefferson decided to go ahead with the purchase anyway in order to remove France's presence in the region and to protect both U.S. trade access to the port of New Orleans and free passage on the Mississippi River. Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase   The above map is the modern day United States with the Louisiana Purchase overlay (in green).  I sometimes try to imagine what would have happened if Louis XV would have preferred to keep La Nouvelle France and trade off La  Guadeloupe instead. I also try to imagine how things would be today if the Louisiana Purchase did not happen. I simply find this part of North America's history fascinating. ",
