Take a look, and you will know what I mean. Certainly, if a political cartoon does raise a laugh by, for example, portraying a politician or a situation as ridiculous, that's a bonus. Similarly, rather too much is passed off as 'satire' these days when it is anything but. Usually it is simple lampooning. Satire has essentially a moral imperative and is used to highlight the immoral, and it, too, is not primarily intended to raise a laugh, although it often does. The word 'cartoon' didn't originally mean to convey humour or laughing at something. It's just that's how the word has since developed. ",

            "answer_text": "The debate over whether a good editorial cartoon is pointed or funny has been raging among editorial cartoonist as long as I have been alive. I think the general consensus is, funny is nice, but pointed is more important and if you can't do both, do the latter. Most editorial cartoonists \u2013 and I know pretty much all of them \u2013 believe that a good cartoon it makes its readers think about things in a new way. Most admire cartoonists who are willing to take a risk, challenging conventional wisdom, whether that means making fun of political leaders from their own party, criticizing a powerful religious authority, or daring to mock sacred cows. But everyone, no matter how serious, understands the value of humor in political commentary. It is the sugar that helps the medicine go down. That said, there are a number of political cartoonists who don't seem to have much interest in serious social commentary, and seem happy with cranking out a series of jokes and puns about the news. You see a lot of those cartoons in America newspapers. But the smarter stuff tends to do better in alternative newsweeklies and on the Internet. Bottom line: everyone enjoys funny political cartoons, and what constitutes funny is completely subjective. ",

            "answer_text": "The elements \u2014 the tools, if you will \u2014 of humor are used, but the intended effect is to provoke thought. Even if the intent is to ridicule, that\u2019s useful, too. Autocrats of all stripes demand worship, and they detest not being taken seriously. Use humor to make \u2018em think. A laugh is a bonus. As for why they\u2019re not clever, I blame the litigious and fearful environment in which newspapers, cartoons and everything else exist today. An editorial cartoon by its nature is open to interpretation and editors like things bland and/or unambiguous, and certainly not provocative. Which is why editorial cartoons of yore were rife with labels and the modern crop is just walls o\u2019words crowding out indifferent art. If I only worry about my readers \u201cgetting\u201d my cartoon, I can be as clever as I like. By and large, my readers don\u2019t let me down. But if I have to explain a cartoon to an editor, well \u2026 Here\u2019s a joke a cartoonist friend of mine delighted in telling me, probably because I was also an editor: \u201cThere was once an editor so stupid, the other editors noticed.\u201d ",

Satire is not always belly laughs and may often just be a knowing nod, but that is humour just the same. Some of my cartoons are meant simply to be slapstick such as this one for last Monday's London Times - Labour Leadership cartoon - Gary Barker Illustrator or to make a point through dark satire such as this one for this week's Tribune Magazine -   Cameron extremism cartoon - Gary Barker Illustrator Both cartoons must be viewed in context and without a knowledge of the original story the humour will be hard to see in many political cartoons, but that doesn't mean it isn't there.
