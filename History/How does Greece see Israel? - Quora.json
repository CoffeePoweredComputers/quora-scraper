            "answer_text": "How does Greece see Israel? Supposed that by \u201cGreece\u201d is meant the State Hellas, the one you call \u201cGreece\u201d. The answer is: A State cannot have any feelings about any other. A State has only interests. Therefore Hellas [Greece] sees Israel as possible partner in many projects. This is a point of view emerged recently due to common energy interests for both parties. This was not the same some years ago due to 2 main reasons: (1) Hellas voted negative for Israel State foundation at UN General Assemply 1947. Of course to do so there were many excuses, such as many Lebanese, Syrian, Saudi Arabian, and Gulf Emirates investments in Hellenic industry could cause damage to public economy, but mainly there was a black mail from Egyptian Authorities to the Greek government that if Hellas vote positive for Israel foundation Egypt will expel the quite big and rich Hellenic communities from Cairo and Alexandria. The United Nations votes to partition Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. Zionist leaders agree to the plan, but the leaders of several Arab countries and of the Palestinian Arab community reject it, leading to intercommunal clashes that ultimately develop into a full-blown civil war. David Ben-Gurion proclaims the establishment of Israel in a ceremony in Tel Aviv on the day the British officially end their rule in Palestine. The following day, Israel is invaded by the armies of five Arab states, beginning the War of Independence.It was a painful decision because there were at that time very strong Israeli communities in the country mainly in Athens and Thessaloniki with significant influence on Hellenic Authorities. However the above action caused a long term reaction of Israelis who were anti-Hellenic by all means and in all circumstances, which generated a vicious circle of contracts in both sides. (2) Hellenic merchants predicted strong antagonism by capable Israeli merchants, so the most wealthy merchants urged Greek government to vote anti-Israeli.2. If by the term \u201cGreece\u201d is meant the people Hellenes [Greeks], you are to the point. People have feelings which mainly drive their behavior. For example many Hellenes feel solidarity for Palestinians but those having relations with Israeli communities in Athens and Thessaloniki feel solidarity for Israelis. On the other hand the Orthodox Church in Hellas was (and still is) very powerful expressing very big influence to the people. The majority of Bishops and priests do believe that Israeli people are forever responsible for Jesus Christ Crussification, and for this reason should be hated ?????? (what can I say? It is nazzistic behavior carried by Christians, and it is a shame), oh Yes it is a reality for many people. On contrary a megalothymus generosity of simple Orthodox Christian Hellenes showed up during German barbarian occupation of Hellas 1941-1944,  when many of them protected Israelis against German apanthropous terrorism and torture, putting their own life in danger. There are too many executions of Hellenes for that reason.  A member of the Palestinian terrorist group which seized members of the Israeli Olympic team, left, and the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches who were killed,  The Six Day War begins. In the course of the war, in which the Jewish state\u2019s survival is threatened by forces of five Arab armies, Israel vastly expands the territory under its control, seizing the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel also reunifies Jerusalem after capturing the city\u2019s eastern half and the West Bank from Jordan. An other real fact I would like to draw attention is the following. In September 9, 1972 George Papadopoulos leader of Colonels Junda declared a 7 day National Mist, to honor the Israeli victims of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre. He was a dictator, he was the same man who refused to offer Suda Naval base Crete to support American fleet during 6 day Arabo-Israeli war.  And the reaction to philo-Israeli behavior was vote against Cyprus in favor of Turkey in UN General Assembly 1974 !!!!! Having into consideration the above real facts : \u201cHow does feel the person asking the question for Israel?\u201d Personal Conclusion: I don\u2019t think that Hellenes and Israelis should be enemies. Both people have too much to win through a healthy antagonism in all human activities. On the other hand many facts from the past have caused heavy injuries to good weal. Therefore it will take a lot of time to restore reciprocal solidarity. The recovery maybe: UNDERSTANDING & COMMUNICATION,  and then friendship should be realized. ",

            "answer_text": "I should start with how Greece used to see Israel in the past (which is significantly different from today) and end up with how we see it today In the past, I would say that Israel was seen in a very negative way. The main reason I see behind it, is that Greece is a country that was created in early 1800\u2019s after a revolution, rather than a traditional colonial big power of Europe like UK or France were. As a result, Greeks used to feel sympathy and show solidarity to all nations that were seen as \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d, and tried to gain independence, and in that case Palestinians were seen as \u201cFreedom fighters\u201d. And of course it\u2019s not only Greece with that attitude, but all countries with similar history. Notice that in every humanitarian aid towards Palestinians during the last decades, Ireland was among the most active countries/nations. The socialistic goverment of 1981 strengthened these attitudes in society, for example the populist leader Andreas papandreou welcomed Arafat as if he was the head of a Palestinian state. Far left, conspiracy theories, \u201cwhite power\u201d far right activists etc also strenghtened an \u201cantisionistic\u201d (which in rare cases trully was anstisemitic) attitude in society and pro-palestinian attitudes. There was even a funny theory (but such theories were known only to conspiracist and small parts of Greek society) that Palestinians were relatives of Greeks, as descendants of Philistines who were supposed to be originated from Crete.. Well even if such a thing is true, Philistines would be Minoans, and Minoans were not Greek, they lived in the island of Crete before Greeks come, and in ALL Genetic studies that have taken place to this day, Jews are the third closest population to Greeks after South-central Italians and some southeast European nations, meanwhile no autosomal genetic affinity is ever seen between Greeks and Palestinians in particular, as it can be seen in this pca:  That was the situation back in 1980\u20132000. Today, during the last 20 years, attitudes dowards Israel are much more positive than in the past, and the more time passes, the more Greeks see Israel in a positive way, and this can be attributed to many reasons: Political, economic and military collaborations between the two countries, the extremely pro-Arab populist governments in Greece belong to the pastGreece is lately one of the 4 most Islamophobic countries of Europe, along with Poland, Italy and Hungary, and if islam is seen as an enemy, the \u201cenemy\u2019s enemy\u201d is seen as a friendconsipracy theories are getting less and less popular in Greek society, as people see that no such theories are confirmed.Greeks realize (and that has to do with Islamophobia as well) that they have overwhelmingly more in common in terms of society, way of life and attitudes with Jews than with any, at least non-Christian nation of the middle eastlately the neonazi party didn\u2019t even enter the parliamentOne third reason that I didn\u2019t mention earlier, and which was suggested by Olga Gorun in a comment bellow: \u201cI thought the change may also be relevant to changes in Israel-Turkey relationships. While they were good, Israel-Greece relationships were low. When Erdogan changed the situation making Turkey much more religious and Palestinians-oriented, Greece relationship with Israel became better. \u201cEnemy of my enemy\u201d one more time.\u201dBut in a weird way things have dramatically changed and the two nations/countries have come extremely closer (I guess they will come even closer in the near future) in the last 2 years, since 2018 (not even 2017) and foreign policy has played a major role on that.
