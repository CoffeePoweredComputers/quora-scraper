Ranged against the migratory tribes of the Cimbri under Boiorix  and the Teutoni were two Roman armies, commanded by the proconsul  Quintus Servilius Caepio and consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus. Roman losses  are described as being up to 80,000 troops, as well as another 40,000  auxiliary troops (allies) and servants and camp followers --- virtually  all of their participants in the battle. All deaths attributed to  weapons prior to the invention of gunpowder.\" Basically, one very large  knife fight. http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-bloodiest-battles-of-world-war-i.php  http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/topten/index.htmlWaterlooMore than 26,000 French were killed or wounded     and another 9,000 captured at Waterloo.

            "answer_text": "Wikipedia cites the losses for the first day of the Somme: British: 20,000 killedFrench: 7,000 killedGerman: 8,000 killedTotal: 35,000 killedMy guess was Antietam, which was 23,000 on both sides. Teutoberg seems to be 20,000+, but Wikipedia is completely unclear on the number of German casualties. Could be anywhere from 30,000-50,000 The Napoleonic battle of Borodino blows these out of the water, with 70,000 casualties, though it's unclear how many of these casualties were deaths. On the other hand, with the rudimentary state of medicine, it's possible that a large fraction died, possibly over 50%, making a higher death count than the first day of the Somme. If you consider strategic bombing of civilians to be a battle, then, here's Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki, all according to Wikipedia: Dresden (firebombing, night of 13/14 March, 1944): 25,000Tokyo (firebombing, 9/10 March, 1945): 90,000 - 125,000Hiroshima: 80,000Nagasaki: 70,000",
