            "answer_text": "Yes! Free your mind first! Let the concept of zero be a thought experiment and assume there is no single theory on how time is (for instance, is the time linear, circular, spiral, divided, relative, subjective, objective, not measurable\u2026?) A year starts always on zero. The first year starts on zero, the second year starts on zero.. the 2018th year starts on zero\u2026 etc). The year 0 marks that the first year is starting on 0. Therefore there must be a definitive year zero, otherwise year 0 can be all the years starting points, the starting points of circulation around the sun every time with not the very exact same ending time, a normally neglected difference from year to year. A day was less than a hour shorter 600 million years ago, but this has stabilized to 24 hrs plus a correction. That a Earth year always begins on zero makes more sense in space, but not in very small spirals. Then, zero makes no sense. Do not forget about separate time due to relativity/differences in travelling speeds. At this point, a zero of time is more meaningful in the thought experiments. The year zero marked the start of multiple parallell starts. What about winter solstice or Mithra as the romans believed in (incorrectly)? Year zero could have been started with a vast number of weather types. A vast range of wind speeds. Even every 24 clock hours around the earth if timezones existed. Night and dark. Rain, clouded or sunny? There is no way to tell time in one way. The year zero could have marked birth of Christ, although that is very unlikely, even in 1 CE, because the calendar was adjusted used by monks very much later based on early Roman ideas about Rome, before Christianity had any real influence. The Emperors did. There was not much science behind a monk in the 6th century either. There is a zero between 1 BCE and 1 CE, but you will not notice it at all. Zero is a concept. ",

There are clearly billions of arguments about when did the millennium began. 3 examples People in the end of 1799 thought it was the end of the 18th century. When 1800 arrived to the world, people thought the 19th century began. People in the end of 1899 thought it was the end of the 19th century. When 1900 arrived to the world, people thought the 20th century began. People in the end of 1999 thought it was the end of the 20th century, & 2nd millennium. When 2000 arrived to the world, people thought the 21st century, & 3rd millennium began, & also the Y2K bug was expected around the world since it was about computers shutting down, & lights going out. Usually I say it\u2019s weird that 2001 was the start of the millennium since that stupid monk never invented 0 as 753 AUC since BC means \u201cBefore Christ\u201d & AD means in a Latin term \u201cAnno Domini\u201d translates \u201cIn the year of our lord\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter anyways since we are almost into the new decade, the 2020s ",
