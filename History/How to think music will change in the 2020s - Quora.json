            "answer_text": "Music is deeply intertwined with society and technology. The kind of music that would permeate through the cultural consciousness is largely built on some informal cultural consensus, with technology being the medium that can distribute music. TLDR; Better tech, more opportunities, more diversity in music With the rise of 5G, streaming services, and increasing ease of music publication, I would expect the kind of music from 2020 onward to be really diverse. Independent musicians will eventually become the norm as more services online begin to unbundle the benefits a traditional label provides. Traditional media like radio, on-air TV shows, will eventually lose their prominence and there will be a tilt towards on-demand streaming services. This has already happened, what we can expect is an increase in intensity of this shift. This will spark a shift in expectations of how we should be consuming music. The advances in communication technology and collaboration maybe through AR/VR will give rise to new kinds of opportunities and new kinds of workflow that will enable global collaboration. With a growing and affluent middle-class in Asia, there will be a non-negligible chance that musicians from the West will need to target Asia as a growing market. With this mix, more cross-cultural influences will start to pervade the musical consciousness. Musical culture will become increasingly decentralized as multiple cultural hubs around the world would emerge. An example of this recent shift is the rise of Kpop around the world. The experience of music is not merely tied to sound alone but through visuals. With AR/VR/MR, there will be radically new ways of experiencing music. It\u2019s still nascent, but should the adoption of AR/VR technology improves, it would provide artists a cost effective way of hosting concerts with global reach. While not as immersive, at the moment a starting point for this movement would be the live streaming platforms available online. Through these technologies, the gap of music business tools between an established musician vs a hobby musician will start to diminish. The real differentiation is really purely musical expression and ideas. A largely ignored aspect of music making is funding. Instruments cost money or time to build, however, the costs has been largely diminished due to the prevalence of digital instruments that can be emulated on a computer. Funds will largely be required for promotional campaigns or tours. With royalty investment and artist investment platforms, artists can find new way of raising funds by securitizing some kind of collateral in their possession. This possibility is largely provided through the use of blockchain and smart contracts. However, there are legal challenges in this area that will impede widespread adoption of such fundraising opportunities. There maybe a possible rise of black-market/grey-market funding systems. Patreon or patronship models, will still be a substantial way for creators and musicians to monetize their audiences in order to pursue music as a full-time career. Until streaming income really improves for the average artist, most artists will either have to pursue music part-time or find alternative revenue. However, alternative revenues can only be made possible only if you have an audience. The last aspect I can think of is regarding music promotion, music discovery, and audience building. Building an audience is a crucial aspect of being a creator online. It is really the death chasm that decides whether being a musician is viable at all. The kinds of musicians that can transcend this death chasm sets the bounds on the kind of music that you will eventually consume. A pivotal tool for music promotion and social music discovery at the moment would have to be TikTok. It allows people to remix music with creative videos, challenges, and provide renditions to a track that they hear. With in-built virality, this is one way a nobody musician can rise to superstardom, all through the power of memes and short funny videos. Lil Nas X is one such marketing genius. With a large gen z + gen alpha audience (born 1995\u20132010), TikTok is likely going to pervade cultural consciousness in this decade. Memes and music will become more and more intertwined as musicians would need to be ever more culturally relevant. Deeply embedded in this system of music discovery are recommendation algorithms. For the average user, discovery algorithms are good enough, however, there appears to be a gap for power users who would like to have more autonomy over the musicians they discover. Musicians, on the flip-side, are really at the mercy of discovery algorithms. While it is true that the algorithms optimize for engagement, not all musical works are designed for maximum engagement. Music will paradoxically be more sterile if engaging music is all there is. To transcend algorithms, musicians would then need other guerilla promotion strategies. Music promotion is largely guarded by a gatekeeper class (music blogs, playlists) or have restrictive costs for the emerging musician (social media ads). Traditional word-of-mouth means of promoting music will remain a fundamental aspect of music. With the rise of the independent musician, there will be an increasing need for more avenues of music promotion to gain an organic audience. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve listened to a lot of music and observed societal trends, and I can tell you with a fair amount of confidence that nothing is set in stone. There\u2019s no telling! But I do have a theory I like. Culture moves in rough 30-year cycles. 60s nostalgia hit its peak in the 90s, helped a lot by the release of Austin Powers and the subsequent return of 60s fashion (I saw this happen in high school, girls in bell bottoms, etc.). 70s nostalgia hit its peak in the 2000s (think TV shows like \u201cLife on Mars\u201d, platform shoes and so on). This decade, though a lot of people are loathe to admit it, the 80s are back! Artists like HAIM and Taylor Swift have recorded very 80s-sounding material, the TMNT were a big deal, need I go on? But many people will insist that the 80s sucked and people were unhappy largely because Republicans were in office and it\u2019s kind of a closet political bias. So 30 years ago we had Ronald, now we have Donald\u2026what comes next? If this is an 80s redux, it\u2019s important to note that the 80s were known for excess and artifice. Keyboards (and keytars) were all the rage, as was the drum reverb effect discovered by accident by Phil Collins. Hair metal was big, loud, glitzy and as in-your-face as can be, and many people felt that music culture on the whole was too shallow and superficial. The early 90s saw a strong rebuke in the form of alternative music. Nirvana hit it big with Nevermind, and in the wake of that album, grunge took off, and all at once all the excesses of the 80s melted away to leave a stripped-down husk of the sound that had been dominant, albeit with better production. Even the vocals were delivered in a muddy manner. Many people think of 1993 as a really bad year for metal, and metal was indeed on its knees for a brief moment. People wanted authenticity\u2014though as a metal fan, I won\u2019t say metal is inauthentic, but a lot of hair bands certainly seemed so. Music culture changed and only very slowly started creeping back toward using all the tools at its disposal to reach for perfection once again. I expect to see this pattern repeat itself. The 2010s are all about the accessibility of home production and independent releases, which invites anyone who wants to to produce music entirely on their computer. And both indie and famous artists have leaned heavily on autotune to fix their most trifling mistakes and produce singing that isn\u2019t even human anymore. A lot of people are bothered by this, plenty of others don\u2019t care! But don\u2019t be surprised if there is a strong backlash in the 2020s where people decide to do away with artificial sounds and pick up real instruments, and sing badly, or else dirty up what their software puts out. We\u2019ll see some kind of rock revival, albeit a strange-sounding new form of it, perhaps where the artist sounds horrible and out of tune on purpose, and we\u2019ll also get lo-fi, discordant, offbeat techno reminiscent of Goth music, but different. Rap will probably go underground and continue to thrive there, dying off much like hair metal did (it\u2019s already had a much longer heyday, unless you think of hair metal as the culmination of rock and roll). New genres will come along, country might see an extreme makeover and go back to its roots (or effectively get swallowed up) and world music will have greater reach (think hits in Spanish, Korean, Chinese and Arabic). Also, I bet we\u2019ll have at least one trans superstar, depressing though that might be, and this person will, of course, be a sex symbol. ",
