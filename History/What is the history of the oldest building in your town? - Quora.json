            "answer_text": " I live in Pavia, in Italy, where the oldest constructions are actually underground, and they are the old Roman sewer network, over 2,000 years old. They criss-cross the city in a grid pattern, and most of them still effectively carry rain-water down to the river Ticino today. In the 14th century, a local historian writing a Latin book about the city, said that some of the sewers are so big that it\u2019s possible to ride down them on horseback. In the 20th century, a university student named Carlamaria Tomaselli decided to see if this was true, and with her hard hat on she went down into the ancient tunnels, Indian Jones style, and found it really was the truth. Today you can see a section of sewer in the market beneath the main square of town.  ",
