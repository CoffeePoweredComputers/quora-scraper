            "answer_text": "I will never give up & that's not with all things, I dont believe it has to be, I just see what the majority of my personality brings to the value of my life morally speaking. I don't know what it means to give up on everything entirely or to state that in general I'd be giving up, the sense of the term doesn't click rightly. Having said that I wont give up and no one should (generally speaking) on what matters the most to them, no matter how much problems seems to worsen and multiply in life let me tell you nothing is not capable of change in your mind. Best way to realise your lowest point to your highest point is by self belief & honesty to yourself as a person. Dont pity yourself or give in to failure because that there is you losing a fight before you have even begun. The real fight is the problems you encounter, use the drive that everyone has in them & when you get down you get back up stronger. ",
