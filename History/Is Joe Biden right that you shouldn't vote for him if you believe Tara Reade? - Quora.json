            "answer_text": "No. If you believe Tara Reade then you should also believe the several women who have accused Donald Trump (they\u2019re a lot more credible and illustrate a trend, rather than being non-credible and an isolated claim). If you believe both candidates have committed sexual assault then that shouldn\u2019t be your decision-driver. But, let\u2019s assume it *is* your decision driver, and you want to see justice done. Both men should then be in court, right? Now there are only two outcomes to the race: Joe is President, or Donald is President. Withholding your vote won\u2019t change that. So, you should ask, which arrangement is more likely to see *both* men hauled up on investigations and charges \u2026 which man is more likely, if elected President, to finagle some delay and to seek immunity for himself, attempt to destroy the reputation of his accuser(s), enlist the DOJ as to quash and defend state-level charges against himself, and so forth? The one who has already done those things and would feel even more empowered if (re)elected; or, the guy with no history of doing such things? If you think Tara Reade is believable, and you want justice for her and for Donald\u2019s victims, then history shows you should vote for Biden. ",

            "answer_text": "On some level, Biden is in a bit of a no-win situation here. He knows that there are people out there that simply because of the allegation will not vote for him. He claims he did not do it and there\u2019s not a whole lot of evidence to indicate that he did, given the\u2026 elastic nature of his accusers history on this subject. I think he\u2019s basically trying to give those people that will not want to vote for him now an out. He doesn\u2019t want to do an \u2018what-aboutism\u2019, and even said he\u2019d not vote for himself if he believed the accusation. That will buy him leeway with women\u2019s groups who may be having a hard time with this, along with publicly supporting an investigation into it. Reade is the first person to actually accuse Biden of assault, not harassment or touchy-feely general creepiness. After having such a long career in politics, to have one allegation and have the accuser be so spotty on this I can\u2019t imagine many women who would be inclined to support Biden anyways (or simply want Trump out) are not going to cast their vote in his favor, even if they have to plug their nose while doing it.
