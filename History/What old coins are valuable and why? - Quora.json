            "answer_text": "This is too general a question to which there is no easy answer! This is like asking the question \u201cHow long is a piece of String?\u201d Just because a Coin may be Old or even Ancient does not guarantee that it is valuable. As already stated, value may be determined by Rarity and not Age. Preservation is most important when considering this question. A very worn Ancient Coin may have very little value due to the lack of surface detail. Many people are under the false apprehension that just because a Coin is Roman it therefore must be valuable; nothing could be further from the truth! Many Ancient Coins are discovered each year and most may be in a dreadful state of preservation. To truly determine the value of an Old Coin it is important to consider many factors. As I have already mentioned Age is not one of them. Some Collectors will spend many thousands of pounds/dollars in the false belief that they have purchased something truly valuable. I say a Fool and his Money are soon parted! In this scenario preservation is all important and a badly worn Coin has nothing to offer the Numismatic Scholar as opposed to the often naive Coin Collector. There are far too many people whom place more emphasis on \u201cintrinsic value\u201d than is properly placed on Historical importance which is of far more value to the Numismatic Scholar. To show how this may be viewed in context, a while back a supposedly Rare Coin was offered in a Numismatic Auction in Belgium. The Coin in question was a small Silver Dirhem of the Mongol Great Khans and issued during the Regency of the Widow of Ogadai Khan, one of the successors to the Mongol throne and son of GENGHIS KHAN. The overall preservation/grade was very poor and little if any of the Original Design remained. However, this particular Coin bore the Name of a previously Unknown City Mint! This piece was of some interest to me but nothing beyond that point therefore my Bid was fairly low as was the estimated value of the Coin in question. Later I was to learn that this particular Coin sold for the princely sum of \u20ac800 + buyers premium of 18%. To be perfectly honest I was shocked at this outcome because in my opinion this was a lot of money for what I believed to be a virtually worthless Coin! The only significant factor here is that it bore the name of a previously Unknown Mint and that is all. Most of the original identifying features had been lost, which included the Date and most of the Legend (Inscription). Just because this amount was paid for the aforementioned Coin does in no way imply that this was its true value. \u00a7 Lucie Lou Snowfall \u00a7 / 2019.  SELJUKS OF RUM AR Dirham of the Boy King Qilij Arslan IV A.D. 1248. This being similar in Style to the Coins of the Great Mongols during this Period. The obvious main difference being that on the Mongol Issue of Queen Turakina/Turazina the Horseman is drawing his Bow while facing backward and the Horse is in full Gallop! L.L.S. ",

            "answer_text": "That is a complicated question. What old coins are valuable depends on a LOT of factors. Things like: where in the world you are (your numismatics market may be very different from mine), where and when the coins were minted, what material were they made of, what is their historical significance, and most importantly, what will someone pay to buy them. Why are they valuable is the easier part. Old, collectible coins are valuable because there are people who want to own them and so, there is a market for them. Depending on how plentiful or scarce the coins are, the market raises or lowers their value. Thanks for the A2A Hallie :) ",
