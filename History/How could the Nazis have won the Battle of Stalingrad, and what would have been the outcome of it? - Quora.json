The original purpose and aim of the Stalingrad campaign was simply to cover the northern flank of the main objective to capture the oil fields of the Caucuses. Capturing the city itself wasn't considered necessary to do this, merely isolating it would prove sufficient. However, the mere fact that Stalingrad had Stalin's name in it turned the covering action into a personal vanity project for Hitler. As it turned out, that vanity project was the worst possible decision. The southern objectives were unattainable because they didn't have sufficient forces, and it wouldn't have mattered, because the Soviets trashed the well heads. Meanwhile, the vanity project allowed the Soviets to create a perfect trap, destroying one of Hitler's best armies, and turning the tide on the Eastern front. ",
