            "answer_text": "Pick One: Jakob Fugger 1459\u20131525 (66 years) 400 [4] German merchant, mining entrepreneur and banker. He expanded Fugger family's assets by spreading their operations across Europe. At one point, Fugger & family had an almost monopolistic hold on the European copper market. [10] At his death, Jakob Fugger bequeathed to his nephew Anton Fugger company assets totaling 2,032,652 guilders. [11] Referred to as \"Fugger the Rich\". John D. Rockefeller 1839\u20131937 (97 years) 336 [3] On September 29, 1916, Rockefeller became the first person ever to reach a nominal personal fortune of US$1 billion (equivalent to US$16 billion in 2018). [12] Rockefeller amassed his fortune from the Standard Oil company, of which he was a founder, chairman and major shareholder. By the time of his death in 1937, estimates place his net worth in the range of US$300 billion to US$400 billion in adjusted dollars for the late 2000s (decade). When considering the real value of his wealth, Rockefeller is widely held to have been the wealthiest American, as well as the richest person in modern history. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Andrew Carnegie 1835\u20131919 (84 years) 310 [3] Carnegie founded the Carnegie Steel Company, which was the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations in the United States; in 1901, Carnegie sold his company for US$480 million to J.P. Morgan, who then merged his company into U.S. Steel. [19] Capitalized at US$1.4 billion at the time, U.S. Steel was the first billion dollar company in the world. In his final years, Carnegie's net worth was US$475 million, but by the time of his death in 1919 he had donated most of his wealth to charities and other philanthropic endeavors and had only US$30 million left to his personal fortune. Carnegie's hundreds of millions accounted for about 0.60% of the U.S. annual GDP and has a real value estimated at about US$75 billion adjusted for the late 2000s (decade). [13] [14] Nicholas II of Russia 1868\u20131918 (50 years) 250\u2013300 Emperor of All Russia from 1894 to 1917. Estimates of the wealth of Nicholas II remain wildly speculative. As emperor, and an autocrat, the resources under Nicholas II's command were virtually incalculable. However, the vast majority of this was officially owned by the State as Crown property. From this, supplemented by an annuity from the Treasury, he derived an annual income of 24 million roubles, from which he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings. [20] \"Before the end of the year, the Tsar was usually penniless; sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn.\" [20] According to the Grand Marshall of the Court, Count Paul Benckendorff, his personal wealth only amounted to between 12.5 and 17.5 million roubles. [21] Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII 1886\u20131967 (81 years) 210 The last Nizam of Hyderabad State in British India. Regarded as the wealthiest person in the world during his lifetime, his portrait was on the cover of Time magazine in 1937. [22] As a semi-autonomous monarch, he had his own mint, printing his own currency, the Hyderabadi rupee, and had a private treasury that was said to contain \u00a3100m in gold and silver bullion, and a further \u00a3400m of jewels (in 2008 terms). The major source of his wealth was the Golconda mines, the only supplier of diamonds in the world at that time. [23] [24] Among them was the Jacob Diamond, valued at some \u00a350m (in 2008 terms), [25] [26] [27] and used by the Nizam as a paperweight. [28] Henry Ford 1863\u20131947 (84 years) 188\u2013199 Henry Ford was an American automotive engineer, entrepreneur, and founder of the Ford Motor Company. By designing the Model T Ford with mass production in mind and employing the assembly line method of rapid production, he was able to radically lower the base price of his automobiles and reach a wider market. As production increased, Ford further reduced prices and increased salaries to reduce worker turnover. This resulted in a rapid increase in output, with Ford production rising from roughly 18,000 cars in 1909 to over 1 million cars in 1920. Despite Ford stating that his focus was increasing Ford Motor Company's benefit to society and to its employees, even at one point being sued by the Dodge brothers based on this premise, his company was massively profitable. His highest earnings were recorded at age 57 and he died at the age of 83 in 1947 at a net worth of US$188.1 billion (inflation-adjusted value in 2008 dollars). John Jacob Astor 1763\u20131848 (85 years) 120\u2013138 [29] American businessman, merchant, opium smuggler, fur trader, and investor. In 1801, Astor's nominal wealth was some US$250,000, and by the time of his death in 1848 his fortune had grown to US$20 million, making him America's first multi-millionaire. [13] [14] [15] Cornelius Vanderbilt 1794\u20131877 (83 years) 105 [30] \u2013205 [29] American business magnate and philanthropist who built his wealth in railroads and shipping. Stephen Girard 1750\u20131831 (81 years) 105 [31] \u2013120 [29] French-born American banker. Before becoming a banker, he was a merchant and owned a fleet of trading ships. William Henry Vanderbilt 1821\u20131885 (64 years) 52\u2013239 [32] Railroad owner. Inherited much of his wealth from his father, Cornelius Vanderbilt, [31] who initiated the Vanderbilt family's involvement in railroad and shipping business. He doubled his father's fortune, to an amount estimated between $52 billion and $239 billion. [32] Middle Ages[edit] Absolute rulers or conquerors are sometimes listed for the territory they controlled rather than for their immediate personal wealth (Davidson (2015) for TIME Homepage listed Akbar I, Genghis Khanand Emperor Shenzong of Song for their imperial possessions, while Alan Rufus is listed for his immediate possessions within the feudal system of Norman England). [3] Name Lifetime Description Musa I of Mali c. 1280 \u2013 c. 1337 Mansa Musa, or Musa I of Mali is considered one of the richest people ever. Musa was the tenth emperor of the Mali Empire, one of the prosperous Sahelian kingdoms that developed along the Saharan slave trade routes in the later medieval period. Mansa Musa made his fortune by exploiting his country's salt and gold production. [3] [33] [34] Musa is said to have brought several tonnes of gold to Mecca when he made a pilgrimage there in 1324, deflating the value of gold across much, if not all, of North Africa. Reported as being inconceivably rich by contemporaries, \"There\u2019s really no way to put an accurate number on his wealth.\" [35] William the Conqueror c. 1028\u20131087 William the Conqueror became personally enormously wealthy from spoils of war during the Norman Conquest of England. [36] Basil II 958\u20131025 Byzantine emperor from 960 to 1025 at the time of the Eastern Roman Empire's greatest medieval territorial extent, also a time of considerable prosperity for the Empire. Alan Rufus c. 1040\u20131093 Alan Rufus, 1st Lord of Richmond, was a relative and companion of William the Conqueror (Duke William II of Normandy) during the Norman Conquest of England. By 1086 he had become one of the richest and most powerful men of England. [36] William de Warenne,\n1st Earl of Surrey d. 1088 Fought alongside William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings and was rewarded with considerable land holdings in England. [31] [36] [37] Richard FitzAlan,\n10th Earl of Arundel c. 1306\u20131376 English nobleman and admiral. Succeeded to the Earldom of Surrey in 1347. John of Gaunt 1340\u20131399 Third son of King Edward III of England. Duke of Lancaster. Owned land in almost every county in England, with a household comparable to that of a monarch. [38] Antiquity[edit] For Classical Antiquity, even more than for the High Middle Ages, the definition of personal wealth becomes difficult to compare with the modern period; especially in the case of divine kings, where an entire empire might be considered the personal property of a deified emperor. Name Lifetime Description Marcus Licinius Crassus c. 115 BC \u2013 53 BC Crassus inherited a fortune of 7 million sesterces after the death in 87 BC of his father, Publius Licinius Crassus Dives. After several years of exile, Crassus was able to rebuild his family fortune by seizing the property of executed convicts for himself. [39] Crassus also expanded his wealth by trading in slaves and by purchasing whole neighborhoods of Rome as they burned, for drastically less than market value. Crassus was known in Rome as Dives, meaning \"The Rich\". It is believed that Crassus expanded his personal fortune to 170 million sesterces, while Pliny the Elder surmised his fortune to be valued even higher, at 200 million sesterces. This would place Crassus's net worth equal to the total annual budget of the Roman treasury. Crassus has often been listed among the \"wealthiest individuals in history\", although depending on the estimate of the \"adjusted value\" of a Roman sesterce, his net worth may also be placed in the range of US$200 million to US$20 billion. [40] Augustus Caesar 63 BC \u2013 AD 14 Listed by Time Magazine with \"$4.6 trillion\" because he \"personally owned all of Egypt\". [3] Croesus died c. 546 BC The name of Croesus, a historical king of Lydia, was proverbial for wealth already in antiquity; this is probably due to his being the first ruler to issue true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation and not necessarily for his personal wealth. This does not include an empire\u2019s wealth as the personal wealth of the emperor, king, etc. If that is done, your answer is Genghis Khan. ",

            "answer_text": " Genghis KhanA. Dagli\u2014De Agostini/Getty Images 10. Genghis Khan Lived: 1162-1227 Country: Mongolian Empire Wealth: Lots of land, not much else Genghis Khan is undoubtedly one of the most successful military leaders of all time. As leader of the Mongol Empire, which at its height stretched from China to Europe, he controlled the largest contiguous empire in history. However, despite his great power, scholars say Genghis never hoarded his wealth. On the contrary, the Khan\u2019s generosity was key to his influence. \u201cOne of the basis of his success is sharing the spoils with his soldiers and other commanders,\u201d says Morris Rossabi, a distinguished professor of history at CUNY\u2019s Queens College. Jack Weatherford, author of Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World, explains that Mongol soldiers, unlike many pre-modern armies, were banned from taking personal loot. After an area was conquered, every item taken was inventoried by official clerks and then later distributed amongst the military and their families. Genghis still received a share of the spoils, but that hardly made him rich. \u201cHe built no palace for himself or family, no temple, no tomb, and not even a house,\u201d says Weatherford. \u201cHe was born in a wool ger [yurt] and he died in a wool ger. At death he was wrapped in felt, like any common person, and then buried. \u201d  Bill GatesEdgar Su\u2014Reuters 9. Bill Gates Lived: 1955-present Country: United States Wealth: $78.9 billion As the richest living person, Bill Gates\u2019 wealth is refreshingly easy to determine. As of this year, Forbes estimates the Microsoft founder\u2019s net worth at $78.9 billion. That\u2019s about $8 billion more than Zara co-founder Amancio Ortega, the second-richest person in the world.  Bodleian Library Oxford\u2014The Art Archive 8. Alan Rufus (a.k.a. Alan the Red) Lived: 1040\u20131093 Country: England Wealth: $194 billion The nephew of William the Conqueror, Rufus joined his uncle in the Norman conquest. He died with \u00a311,000, according to Philip Beresford and Bill Rubinstein, authors of The Richest of the Rich, which they say . That would amount to $194 billion in 2014 dollars.  John D. Rockefeller Sr.Seattle Times/JR Partners\u2014Getty Images 7. John D. Rockefeller Lived: 1839\u20131937 Country: United States Wealth: $341 billion Rockefeller began investing in the petroleum industry in 1863 and by 1880 his Standard Oil company controlled . According to his New York Times obituary, Rockefeller was valued at about $1.5 billion based on a 1918 federal income tax return and estimates of his overall fortune\u2014the equivalent of almost 2% of U.S. economic output that year according to data compiled by MeasuringWorth (the U.S. did not keep official records on national income until 1932). The same economic share in 2014 would be equivalent to $341 billion.  Andrew Carnegie standing on the steps of his estate, circa 1910s.Corbis 6. Andrew Carnegie Lived: 1835\u20131919 Country: United States Wealth: $372 billion Rockefeller gets all the press, but Andrew Carnegie may be the richest American of all time. The Scottish immigrant sold his company, U.S. Steel, to J.P. Morgan for $480 million in 1901. That sum equates to about slightly over 2.1% of U.S. GDP at the time, giving Carnegie economic power equivalent to $372 billion in 2014.  Ullstein Bild\u2014Getty Images 5. Joseph Stalin Lived: 1878\u20131953 Country: USSR Wealth: Complete control of a nation with 9.6% of global GDP Stalin is an uncommon figure in modern economic history: a dictator with absolute power who also controlled one of the largest economies in the world. While it is virtually impossible to separate Stalin\u2019s wealth from the wealth of the Soviet Union, his unique combination of economic might and complete control of the USSR lead multiple economists to nominate him as one of the richest people of all time. You can easily see their logic. Data from the OECD shows that in 1950, three years before Stalin\u2019s death, the USSR made up roughly 9.5% of global economic output. As of 2014, that level of production would be equivalent to nearly $7.5 trillion dollars. While that money didn\u2019t belong directly to Stalin, he had the ability to leverage Soviet economic might for any reason he chose. \u201cHe had enormous power, and through his power he could have anything he wanted,\u201d says George O. Liber, a professor of history at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \u201cHe controlled 1/6th of the land surface of the planet without any checks or balances.\u201d Does that make Stalin rich in the traditional sense? Liber isn\u2019t so sure. \u201cWas he among the wealthiest men?\u201d the professor wonders. \u201cI suppose if you want to stretch the definition of wealth, but it was not his wealth. He controlled the wealth of the country.\u201d Even so, it\u2019s hard not to include Stalin on a list of the most economically powerful people in history. His wealth might be uncertain, but there\u2019s no question the premier\u2019s personal economic influence is unrivaled in recent history.  The Great AkbarPeter Newark Pictures\u2014Bridgeman Images 4. Akbar I Lived: 1542\u20131605 Country: India Wealth: Ruled empire with 25% of global GDP The greatest emperor of India\u2019s Mughal dynasty, Akbar controlled an empire that accounted for about one-fourth of global economic output. Fortune\u2019s Chris Matthews cites the late economic historian Angus Maddison, who speculates India\u2019s GDP per capita under Akbar was comparable to Elizabethan England, but with \u201ca ruling class whose extravagant lifestyle surpassed that of the European society.\u201d That assertion that India\u2019s elite class was wealthier than their counterparts to the west is backed up by data from economist Branko Milanovic, whose researchshows the Mughal Dynasty was one of the most effective empires of all time at extracting wealth from the population.  Emperor ShenzongPictures from History\u2014Bridgeman Images 3. Emperor Shenzong Lived: 1048\u20131085 Country: China Wealth: Ruled empire with 25% to 30% of global GDP China\u2019s Song Dynasty (960 \u2013 1279) was one of the most economically powerful empires of all time. According to Prof. Ronald A. Edwards, a Chinese economic historian of the Song Dynasty at Tamkang University, the nation accounted for between 25% and 30% of the world\u2019s economic output during its peak. The empire\u2019s wealth came from both its technological innovations and extreme skill at tax collection, which Edwards says was hundreds of years ahead of European governments. The professor also noted the Song Dynasty\u2019s government was highly centralized, meaning the emperor held enormous control over the economy.  Augustus CaesarHoberman Collection\u2014UIG via Getty Images 2. Augustus Caesar Lived: 63 BC\u201314 AD Country: Rome Wealth: $4.6 trillion Not only was Augustus Caesar in charge of an empire that accounted for 25% to 30% of the world\u2019s economic output, but according to Stanford history professor Ian Morris, Augustus at one point held personal wealth equivalent to one-fifth of his empire\u2019s economy. That fortune would be the equivalent of about $4.6 trillion in 2014. \u201cFor a while,\u201d Morris adds, Augustus \u201cpersonally owned all of Egypt.\u201d That\u2019s hard to top.  Mansa MusaAbraham Cresques\u2014Getty Images/The Bridgeman Art Library 1. Mansa Musa Year: 1280\u20131337 Country: Mali Wealth: Richer than anyone could describe Mansa Musa, the king of Timbuktu, is often referred to as the wealthiest person in history. According to Ferrum College history professor Richard Smith, Musa\u2019s west African kingdom was likely the largest producer of gold in the world\u2014at a time which gold was in especially high demand. Just how rich was Musa? There\u2019s really no way to put an accurate number on his wealth. Records are scarce, if non-existent, and contemporary sources describe the king\u2019s riches in terms that are impossible for the time. Some tales of his famous pilgrimage to Mecca\u2014during which Musa\u2019s spending was so lavish that it caused a currency crisis in Egypt\u2014mention dozens of camels each carrying hundreds of pounds of gold. (Smith says one year of Malian gold production probably generated about a ton.) Others said Musa\u2019s army consisted of 200,000 men, including 40,000 archers\u2014troop numbers even modern superpowers would have a difficult time bringing to the field. But to get caught up in the king\u2019s exact wealth is to miss the point. As Rudolph Ware, an associate professor of history at the University of Michigan, explains, Musa\u2019s riches were so immense that people struggled to describe them. \u201cThis is the richest guy anyone has ever seen, that\u2019s the point,\u201d says Ware. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to find words to explain that. There are pictures of him holding a scepter of gold on a throne of gold holding a cup of gold with a golden crown on his head. Imagine as much gold as you think a human being could possess and double it, that\u2019s what all the accounts are trying to communicate.\u201d Thanks\u2026\u2026\u2026 Source : The 10 Richest People of All Time ",
