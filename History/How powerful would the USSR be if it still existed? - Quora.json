            "answer_text": "The USSR - if went the way of Vietnam or China and stabilised instead of falling apart- would have been very powerful. The USSR fell apart due to a multitude of reasons, but the two main reasons would be a severely weakened economy and a destabilised political scene. Au contraire to what the United States often tout, dictatorships and one-party states can still survive, even thrive, if its economy is stably developing and there aren't too much change in politics. Case in point - China or Vietnam, but also Singapore (a very successful benevolent dictatorship), or Equatorial Guinea, Brunei or United Arab Emirates. I would take China and Vietnam as the model, and scale it up to the USSR. The reason for this is the very similar beginnings (single-party state, socialist/communist state, large number of ethnicity but with one ethnic group standing out more than 3/4, decent landmass and resources.) So, what would the USSR be like? Imagine if the Afghan war never happened, and instead of pulling the wrong move of expanding its influence outwards to try and quell the problem within, the Politburo faces inwards and makes small steps towards stabilising life within the union as well as opening markets. Continuing what both the USSR and the US had been doing at the time, thawing the frigid Cold War, deescalating arms (slowly), showing that the two superpowers can work together in programs like Soyuz-Apollo, the USSR would be able to start working on a more open-market from within. Play the cards like China and accept the position of being a close second to the United States instead of being outright in-your-face would be a better ploy, for it would lessen the threat and letting the USSR the somewhat-freedom to focus within. The slow privatisation would prove to the US that the Communist party doesn't seem too much like a threat, and more like an opportunity. On one hand, the USSR slowly opens the market for some consumer-goods from the US to flow in, while carefully allowing private companies to spring up, then slowly privatising the public sector. One of the reasons why the oligarchs are such a powerful and fetid influence in the CIS right now is due to Boris Yeltsin's overzealousness in opening and privatising everything. Instead of slowly opening and giving everyone a chance, only those with massive connections (from Soviet times) and savings can snatch up important industries, turning them into powerful oligarchs. If went the way of China and Vietnam, the USSR would have retained considerable control on the fledgling market, while not expanding the income inequality too quickly. More freedom in the market inevitably leads to inequality, but without control that inequality will destabilise everything. The USSR would have stayed largely the same size-wise, with somewhat more autonomy for the republics within the union. It will be a big player in energy, but much more so than Russia is today - the USSR is large enough to sustain much commerce within itself akin to present-day China, yet command an aggregate energy output of all the socialist republics in the union. There will be no struggle to balance relations between Ukraine and Russia, there will only be Soviet. The USSR would also be, just as Russia is right now, a major player in space industry, as well as having a much greater influence in technology and education. Unlike the US, the USSR is largely devoid of religious nonsense (thus the \"godless reds\" scares in the 60s), and in the long run a more technocratic society will be stronger. There will be less freedom, and freedom of speech will never be a thing so as to protect the sole position of the Communist Party, but instead of large, sweeping reforms that destabilised politics like the ones Gorbachev made, incremental but no less important changes will be made continually, slowly opening the market. The geopolitical influence of the USSR will be immense, and while the US will probably still hold sway in Western Europe, much of Asia will be friendly to the USSR, especially South, East and South East Asia. Due to sheer size, eventually, the USSR would be on top or at least on par with the US in terms of soft power, and eventually in technology and economy. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on a lot of unknown variables. If Gorbachev had been successfully deposed by hardline communist party members, the old USSR might have held on long enough to begin reaping the money from Russian oil. Hard currency (or the lack thereof) played a big role in the collapse of the USSR. Oil and gas exploitation might have bought them some more time. Even with a \"planned economy\" as deeply flawed and riddled with corruption as the USSR, the tremendous influx of money from oil and natural gas might have helped to stablize the sinking Soviet economy.  The geopolitical consequences of an Empire like the USSR hanging on by its fingernails could have had a big effect on the U.S. strategy in the Middle East. I'm relatively certain that there would have been no Iraq invasion. Osama Bin Laden and his happy little band would likely have never become the influence they are today. Without the openness born of Glasnost, a lot of what we know about Soviet military strength would have remained secret. Thus the forces of the U.S. and Europe would likely be nuclear weapon centric. I can't imagine the comprehensive test ban ever going into effect. The U.S. and Soviet military machines would still be on hair trigger alert. However, the Internet would be having a big effect on the culture of the Soviet people. It's likely that some form of economic reform would gain traction. It would be slow and incremental. Without the tremendous impact of the USSR collapse on Soviet finances, it's likely the global economy would have grown in a more sustainable way. The Arab Spring, and China boom would likely have looked very different. In short, the greatest \"power\" of the USSR, would have been the counterbalance it would have provided to the U.S. political, military, and economic empire. Would that have been so bad?  ",
