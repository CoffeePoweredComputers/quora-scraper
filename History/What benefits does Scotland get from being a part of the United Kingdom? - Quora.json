            "answer_text": "I am not sure there is a positive case. There is certainly an arguable negative case that Scottish independence would be economically uncertain and that splitting the UK would be hugely complex after 300+ years of Union. On the first point, I take the view that if Scotland is an economic basket case, despite its natural resources, then that is down to Westminster\u2019s stewardship. On the second, very little good is achieved without some cost and it will be in the interests of both countries to minimise disruption. We want to run our own affairs, not end friendships or be bad neighbours. ",

We get whatever government England votes for and can guarantee to be outvoted in the Westminster Parliament. We get promises that Scotland will be treated as an equal but the promises never materialise into anything. When we ask for another referendum to redress the broken promises we get told that the last referendum was \u201conce in a generation\u201d even though there is no such stipulation in the Edinburgh Agreement setting up the referendum. We were told that the only way that Scotland could stay in the EU was by staying in the UK but when England wants to leave the EU we have to leave along with them. We got to watch the Tories destroy British manufacturing industry and use Scottish revenues to pay redundancies instead of using the wealth to create new industries or to set up an oil wealth fund like Norway did\u2026 ",
