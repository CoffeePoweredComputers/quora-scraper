            "answer_text": "You have the answer in, for example, Why do Sami people have blue eyes and blonde hair? Blue eyes and Blonde hair are generally considered recessive genes although there are major controversies concerning the inheritance of such genes and sub gene. Let's just say that the theoretical models don\u2019t fit the data very well except in first stage inheritance - nature appears to manufacture a lot more natural blondes than genetic theory predicts. For recessive genes to take a grip on a major population, some degree of Inbreeding at some point in time is necessary, or a particular genetic trait so to say develops at the same time for many persons or remains in a place whereas competing traits go away (for example if a disease killed all persons not having blue eyes, or if blondes were considered cursed in Germany and therefore had to move to Denmark to live happily, etc). Generally among Scandinavians, \u201csuper blondes\u201d (meaning almost white-haired blondes) appear to be more common in isolated places such as village areas inland or island areas such as Gotland or \u00d6land, whereas red-haired blondes appear to be more common in the Sm\u00e5land area and \u00c5land island.

            "answer_text": "Blonde hair and blue eyes are not that common among scandinavs. What is common is lighter eyes and hair but most people look like me: hair = the colour of a dead rat, eyes - wishywashy greyish. But some women have very light blond hair and clear blue eyes and it is fairly irresistible. Cute but rare  Even rares among adults  The Scandinavian and Sami populations are distinctly different and have large variations within them. None of us are related to the knotted ware people who were the first hunter gatherer population of Scandinavia, a people who came from present days Southern France and had dark skin and blue eyes. We Scandinavs are northern germanic and our genetics show that we have had much more contact with surrounding countries in the south while northern swedes are more distinctly germanic. The sami are much more complicated. Genetics indicate that three different groups of them came from Siberia but their language is closely related to Finnish. They tend to be dark haired and brown eyed and have different looks from the finns that they are culturally related to. This is sami rapper Maxida M\u00e4rak  Lastly, the Finns. Genetically different from other Scandinavs and from Sami and speaking an uralic language. Also they tend to be blonder and more blue-eyed than us germanic scandinav. They also drive very fast  And lastly a pure swede, Jimmie \u00c5kesson, leader of the right wing semi-racist SD party.  ",
