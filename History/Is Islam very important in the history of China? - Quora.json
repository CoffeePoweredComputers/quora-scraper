            "answer_text": "Yes...one of the greatest empires which historians try to exclude from contemporary education is the Uighur Empire of Present-day Chine/Mongolia.  Most westerners haven't a clue that the Uyghurs ever had an empire. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_people After the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, Transoxiana and Kashgar became the domain of his second son, Chagatai Khan. The Chagatai Khanate split into two in the 1340s, and the area of the Chagatai Khanate where the modern Uyghurs live became part of Moghulistan, which meant \"land of the Mongols\". In the 14th century, ***a Chagatayid khan Tughluq Tem\u00fcr converted to Islam***.  His son Khizr Khoja conquered Qocho and Turfan (the core of Uyghuristan) in the 1390s, and the Uyghurs there became largely Muslim by the beginning of the 16th century.  After being converted to Islam, the descendants of the previously Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" (Dzungars) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area. This is from wikipedia:  \"The Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate were part of a Turkic confederation called the Tiele, who lived in the valleys south of Lake Baikal and around the Yenisei River. They overthrew the Turkic Khaganate and established the Uyghur Khaganate. The Uyghur Khaganate stretched from the Caspian Sea to Manchuria and lasted from 744 to 840.  It was administered from the imperial capital Ordu-Baliq, one of the biggest ancient cities built in Mongolia. In 840, following a famine and civil war, the Uyghur Khaganate was overrun by the Yenisei Kirghiz, another Turkic people. As a result, the majority of tribal groups formerly under Uyghur control dispersed and moved out of Mongolia.\"  The majority of modern Uyghurs are Sunnis, although conflicts exist between Sufi and non-Sufi religious orders.  While modern Uyghurs consider Islam to be part of their identity, religious observance varies between different regions. In general, Muslims in the southern region, Kashgar in particular, are more conservative.  For example, women wearing Burqa (brown cloth covering the head completely) are more common in Kashgar but may not be found in some other cities.  There is also a general split between the Uyghurs and the Hui Muslims in Xinjiang, and they normally worship in different mosques. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the answer is NO.      First,in the long history of China,no religions are very important,including Islam,Buddhism,or even Daojiao originated in China.Almost all the emperors or kings obsessed in the religions(and in most cases,it is Buddism or Daojiao,not Islam) are blamed for the rediculious behaviour in the history books.From this ,we can conclude the official attitude to the religion.It can be habit in personal life,but it mustn't be the mainstream culture in socioty.      On the other hand,though Islam is important in present Xinjiang and other proxinces , these areas are not the core areas in ancient China,so it has no influence for the rulers thousands of kilometers for away.As mentioned in another answer,there may be a emperor in Urgur,but at that time,this is the age of Song Dynasty,whose capital is Linan(Hangzhou)far away from there.
