            "answer_text": "There was a community of several hundred Chinese in Greenville, Mississippi through most of the 20th century. Until the end of World War 2 Chinese children were only allowed to attend the public schools that Black students attended. At some point in the mid 1940\u2032s Hodding Carter, Jr., editor of Greenville's newspaper, the Delta Democrat Times, led an effort to allow the Chinese children to attend White public schools. That occurred shortly afterwards. It would be another twenty years before Black children would attend public schools with White children in Greenville. ",

            "answer_text": "The people who cared about such things almost always applied the \u201cone drop rule\u201d. The official standard was that if you had even \u201cone drop\u201d of black blood, you were black. So if you had even one black ancestor, you were black no matter how white you looked or acted. Of course, many people who had partial black ancestry were successfully able to hide that fact. Many fair-skinned people were able to \u201cpass\u201d for white, and did so for their whole lives. But if they were ever found out, they would be immediately reclassified as \u201cblack\u201d and would be punished in a variety of legal and extra-legal ways for having dared to try to fool the white people.
