            "answer_text": "Doctrine is a belief system or unsubstantiated belief. Indoctrination refers to the uncritical acceptance of doctrine. Ideology in contrast is a science of values based on objective evidence and argument. Indoctrination tends to imply nefarious or disingenuous persuasion; but a great deal of indoctrination arises from good intentions or the perception of helping the recipients, or being for the greater good. In truth, there could not be construed to be \u2018a good divorced from the valuer\u2019, unless we are obliging a valuer to suspend the importance of their own life for others.
