            "answer_text": "Yes. The Roman Republic had two Consuls. Each could veto the other's decisions.San Marino today has two Captains-General, modelled on the Roman Consuls. Once powerful, their role today is mostly ceremonial.Northern Ireland has a Chief Minister and a Deputy Chief Minister. Their roles are identical, except that the Chief Minister has a bit more prestige.Andorra has two Co-Princes : the President of France and the Bishop of Urgel. Their role today is mostly ceremonial.Cambodia had two Co-Prime Ministers in the early 1990s. It broke down when one of the co-Prime Ministers, Hun Sen, decided that he disliked sharing power with his fellow co-Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranaridh, and got the army to carry out a coup for him. Almost 30 years later, he's still running the show.Cyprus, prior to the upheaval of the 1970s,had a President and Vice President who were practically equal. They could veto each other's decisions.Switzerland has a seven-member Council of State. Its members are all equal. There is a President, who serves for one year, but - apart from prestige - (s)he is just a member of the Council and does not have any powers that his or her fellow-Councillors do not have.",

            "answer_text": "Andorra has two co-princes. The President of France and the local Spanish bishops take the jobs. San Marino elects two Captains-General for six month terms. Both of those countries operate as more or less traditional parliamentary states these days and the two co-heads of state have little power. In Northern Ireland, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister are in many ways co-heads of government. The devolved government cannot function unless there is support from both the Unionist and Nationalist communities, as represented in the Assembly, for appointing a pair that must work together. ",
