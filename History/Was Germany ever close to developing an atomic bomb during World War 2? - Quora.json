They thought there was no way to amass enough fissionable material for a bomb. After that the project was scaled back and refocused on trying to develop nuclear power generation. When the German scientists, including Heisenberg, who were captured and transported to the UK after Germany's surrender, were allowed to learn about the US dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, they were flabbergasted. When they learned of the second bomb, they were dumbfounded. The only thing several of them agreed on after learning of these events was that it was good thing they had failed so badly. Most of them were quietly horrified at the thought of what Hitler might have done if they had succeeded. ",

If the USSR has not suffered such an extensive destruction they would have had their first atomic bomb perhaps already in 1947 or even before. ",
