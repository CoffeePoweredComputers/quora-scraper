            "answer_text": "Essentially those brought up to believe it was a good thing. And those who have tribal allegiances. This is not hard to understand. This will include not just far right individuals like Nigel Farage, Tommy Robinson, or Katie Hopkins, but many others who'd like to believe it so. And of course for Britain it was a good thing while it lasted. Not so for others. But sadly those who believe so don't realise that this hangover from the past is now a millstone round the neck that holds Britain back on mostly every front. The illusions, delusions and confusions it has conferred on the British are that millstone. For example, a Quora user called Colin Riegels has written his answer by stating that Niall Ferguson provides a well balanced explanation of why the Empire was also rather good in certain ways and made the modern world for the better. Reigels writes of Ferguson's book \u201cIt really is a fascinating book. I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough.\u201d He neglects to mention a few important points - which maybe of less interest to him than to others, but remain crucial nonetheless: But as Pankaj Mishra reminded us in his LRB Review of the book, Ferguson is hardly a disinterested observer: \u201c\u2019Let me come clean,\u2019 Ferguson wrote in the New York Times Magazine in April 2003, a few weeks after the shock-and-awe campaign began in Iraq, \u2018I am a fully paid-up member of the neoimperialist gang.\u2018\u201d Hold that thought. A fully paid up member of the neo imperialist gang\u2026 So who would find his books on British Empire and history balanced and helpful? Certainly not those who aren't fully paid up members of the neoimperialist gang\u2026 And see this is exactly what was wrong about Britain's imperial past then, and its imperial justifications now. I do understand that it's hard to let go - but Britain must, for its own sake, rather than simply to please others. So what's my issue with Ferguson's perspectives? Primarily that he is not deep enough to be able to see issues from different points of view and come to a synthesis. This forces him to write from one side only - and then apply his reflexive bias and agenda. He just lacks higher understanding. Plus he is a third rate opportunist who belatedly lays claims to ideas he hasn't come up with - nor has much capacity to begin to understand. His writing on financial markets is therefore essentially shallow and borrowed. But I see he laid claim to understanding nonlinear effects in financial markets\u2026. though of course he understands nothing. I wonder where he was in 2004, 2007 and 2008 when I have gave the first such talks on nonlinearity in finance at the Global Derivatives Conferences. Why did he latch on to it well after 2010? And how could he even begin to understand? So an opportunist - full of ego, and one sided pictures. Hence a massive supporter of the Iraq War and a proud neo-conservative. And when a real talent like Pankaj Mishra took him to the cleaners in a book review on LRB, Ferguson got riled up. But what goes for Ferguson, which I must grant him, is that he is forceful speaker for his tribe. An Ayotallah of the Right\u2026of imperialism, right wing extremism, and justifications, whether reasonable or contrived. Here is Mishra's thoughtful review of the book mentioned above: Pankaj Mishra \u00b7 Watch this man: Niall Ferguson\u2019s Burden \u00b7 LRB 3 November 2011 I've never written a book review but after reading that piece of one sided tripe Ferguson penned, I had started writing along the lines of what Mishra wrote. Thankfully Mishra's review meant that I didn't need to continue. Mishra's reference to the not so bright thoughts of the superior acting but intellectually and morally limited character called Tom Buchanan in the The Great Gatsby couldn't have been more apt. That's exactly the thought that came into my head when I read what Ferguson wrote. F Scott Fitzgerald saw through the shallow thoughts of his created character a hundred years ago. But a hundred years later we still invoke those same shallow thoughts to justify much that was no good. I shall leave the final word about current justifications for the British Imperial past to F Scott Fitzgerald, penned about the general human condition: \u201cSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\u201d British imperialism is in the past: it was hugely unsavoury for many then, and it continues to hold Britain back, no matter how useful it was then.  Unlike Colin Riegel's exclusive focus on just Niall Ferguson's book, I shall include two other books that made much recent impact: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company: Amazon.co.uk: Dalrymple, William: 9781408864371: BooksWhat the British Did to India: Amazon.co.uk: Tharoor, Shashi: 9780141987149: BooksHow Britain Made the Modern World: Amazon.co.uk: Ferguson, Niall: 9780141987910: BooksThe first book is written by a British writer living in India, and the second by an Indian politician and historian. Both of them are riveting reads - especially the first. It's written by a highly gifted writer, with an inherent sense of fairplay, and much empathy for the human condition - independent of tribal allegiances. ",

            "answer_text": "As a French Anglophile, I have lived in two English-speaking Countries: England and the USA and I loved it. Compared to France where I was born and raised, I can see that the British Empire was a good thing because today as one of my former French teacher told us students, wherever the British went, they set up democratic government.Neither the French, Spanish, Portuguese, Belgian, Dutch, Russian, Chinese or German ever set up such systems of government wherever they went.I spent ten years in England and I have been in the USA for 32 years. I love both countries a lot more than my own native land: France.I also love Canada and Australia and New Zealand, which are great. The more time goes the more Canada is more proud of being Canadian. Quebec\u2019s desire of independence is going down and after two referendum, this is great. What is unique about Canada is that it is working in spite of issues. It is a democratic country where each province has so much power that the Federal Government looks very small in comparison but yet still big enough to keep the country together. Australia is great, too. It is a Commonwealth. Each state decided to unite as the American States did. Australia is the only continent that is occupied by one country. That is great because there will be no war there against another country. And it is an island, in fact the only island continent in the world. I love it.New Zealand has created a system where the Maori are the best represented Native people of any New Countries: USA, Canada and Australia.India is a democracy and they adopted the British political system. When I was growing up so many countries that just became independent were so weak that they would fall into the hands of communists. But not India. After independence, India was able to feed the whole population of the sub-continent\u2014name for india\u2014 and now it is a economic miracle when one observes that it is growing so fast. And the population went from 600 million in the 1960s to a Billion 300 Million. Wow! and it is still democratic. Very smart people. They did not have a real language to unite the People of India. Hindi was more of a regional language found in most INdian states. So when they made English the Neutral International Language, they united the people even more and this has contributed to elevate India to a higher level. ",

            "answer_text": "Like anything, there were pros and cons to the British empire, we all know the cons as they are constantly posted on Quora by Americans and nationalists from India. All of the bad things can be explained by historical context. The good things: Peace. Pax Brittanica. We came to lands were warfare had been the way of life for millennia, India and Africa, for example were places of continuous war. And the British stopped it. Britain made the world into the most peaceful place it had ever been, far more peaceful than it is today.Rule of Law. Most places we arrived had no rule of law. Might was right. We put in the British legal system which gave the vast majority of people far more human rights than they had ever had before.Trade. Critics claim that Empire was exploitative and merely extracted the wealth of other nations. This is a lie. Empire was all about trade, creating markets for British goods around the world whilst creating markets for global goods in Britain. And huge trade between all the different parts of Empire. This massively advanced the economy of the whole world.Infrastructure. We established and maintained the world\u2019s shipping routes, road systems everywhere we went, and railways including the world\u2019s biggest system, in India. Our plumbing was famous and on the Mediterranean islands we ran, Cyprus, Malta, Rhodes, Corfu, Menorca etc it is safe to drink the tap water!Education. In many nations we brought literacy for the first time and created widespread educational reform. When we found intellectual superstars we often brought them back to Britain to receive the world\u2019s best education. Look up Srinivasa Ramanujan.The English language. The world\u2019s language upon which so much of man\u2019s development has been built. English is the language of trade, the language of science, the language of entertainment, the English language also evolved as a result of empire, new English words were created coming from India, for example, this is why the English language has remained the universal business language of the world.A middle class. Not only businessmen and traders, Empire created a global middle class of doctors, dentists, lawyers, journalists and all the other professions necessary for an advanced civilisation.Technology. The industrial revolution happened in Britain, we invented and developed most of the technology that makes the modern world possible. And we exported much of this out to the Empire. From printing presses to steel works. Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) was established by Dorabji Tata, India in 1907.Sport. The world\u2019s sports, from football, through golf to tennis are the British sports. Empire achieved this.Slavery. The British led the world in trying to get rid of this. The Slave Trade Act of 1807 made the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire, the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 made slavery totally illegal. Between 1808 and 1860, the Royal Navy\u2019s West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard, this was against the wishes of both Portugal and Spain and the Americans.When Empire ended it was often not replaced by liberal democracy, instead a venal, avaricious ruling class took over and treated whole countries as personal fiefdoms. Very many countries went backwards and lots of people in the world would have preferred to have the Empire back. Right wing politicians have continuously blamed the empire for their own failings, it is an easy way out for a failed politician, unfortunately, many of these politicians are in nations where politics is held dear, India, with the world\u2019s best biggest democracy, is a prime example, every election, there is some right wing fundamentalist whom tries to blame imperialism for the failures of successive governments from 1947.

            "answer_text": "How about the opinion of a person who is not in England? Professor Niall Ferguson of Harvard University wrote a particularly interesting book about the British Empire called (slightly unimaginatively) Empire - How Britain Made the Modern World. In it he takes several hundred years of the British Empire and weighs the good against the bad. I can\u2019t possibly repeat all of the different aspects that his book discusses, but one of the more interesting ones is that critiques of the British Empire tend to assume that it was either the British Empire or independence. But truthfully, the choice was between being part of the British Empire or another empire. And one of the things that he paints with dreadful clarity is that of the various Empires that you could be under the control of, the British Empire was by some distance the most benign. That is not to say that the British Empire was without fault - not by any means. But those faults should be weighed in context against the counterfactual alternatives if the British Empire hadn\u2019t been there. It really is a fascinating book. I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough if the ethics and merits of the British Empire are of interest to you. ",

Well, some people in England are all too happy to claim the credit for anything good the United Kingdom did. (Any failures we can always blame the Welsh or Scots for.) And then, on dispassionate analysis there were a lot of people within the bounds of the Empire who derived a lot of benefit from its existence, although there were many whose experience was diametrically opposite. And finally, even if the Empire had been an unmitigated disaster there would still be people who, against all evidence, claimed the opposite. Just as there are still people who deny the Holocaust and even some who claim that Donald Trump is President Perfect. So without saying whether or not I think the British Empire was a good thing, I think that explains how people in England can make the claim. ",

Why do so many just accept toxic Anglo-hating and claim that the British Empire was all bad? Many people liked the Empire and many still do, not just in England. You try to make it sound like just a few people in England supported it, implying that no one in any former colonies liked it and that is a lie. The main problem was that trade expanded too much and they got over-extended as I see it. There are always many problems and things to complain about, whichever time period it is or whatever empire seems to be in charge. I find it odd that many like to complain about the British empire but not about other empires. I guess it takes a lot of heat because it was more recent and so expansive. Getting rid of the British Empire didn\u2019t suddenly make former colonies safer or happier, usually far from it as far as I can tell. ",

Perhaps the British should have left the Dutch, French, Germans and Belgians to it. You seriously think India should have remained a series of princely states? The last two world wars were won thanks to that Empire. Would we all be better off with a Nazi, or Imperial Japanese victory? I grew up in that Empire and liked the idea that much of the world was open to me. I hate how the twentieth century is a history of closed borders, continuing with Brexit.

Its Pax Britannica, built on peace, financial stability, democracy and trade, continues today in nearly all its forms, via the USA. Its Empire is now home to many of the best working democracies. It has won more Nobel Prizes per head than any other country. Intelllectually it is No.1, and culturally no other power comes close in film, literature, comedy, theatre, museums and the arts. Our Universities and science base continue to be equally first with the US in terms of innovation and enterprise. London is the No.1 international city, the No.1 city in Europe, and most of the world\u2019s meaningful international assets are located between Marble Arch and Tower Bridge. The British Empire crushed the West African and East-African/Arabian slave trades, starting 200 years ago - campaigns that not only cost the lives of 40,000 Royal Navy sailors - they also far exceeded the total revenues Great Britain made from the slave trade, yes really. India, its infrastructure, politics, borders, language, transport, its army and legal system, are solidly built on British institutional foundations. When the British left its African colonies it left behind fully working civil and political systems - and Pax Britannica. Conflicts that engulfed the continent were post-empire tribal wars and rivalries that had gone on for centuries before the Europeans arrived - and revived in earnest after the latter had left. Very many Africans lament the departure of the British Empire. ",

Of course, children don\u2019t learn about every attrocity that the imperialists committed, but that isn\u2019t surprising given just how awful the empire was and the limited time available in the school programme for history. When it comes to teaching the horrors of the empire to school children, the focus is often on India, with other parts of the empire being neglected, relatively speaking. I think the UK has examined its past and, until recently, I thought many lessons had been learnt. With the racist arguments advanced by some to support Brexit, I am no longer confident that the UK has changed from a vicious imperialist state to a truly civilised country. ",
