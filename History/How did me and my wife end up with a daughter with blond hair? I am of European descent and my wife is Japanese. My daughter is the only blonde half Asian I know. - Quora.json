In your case, your wife bore the baby so unless she took another woman\u2019s egg, the daughter \u201cis\u201d clearly hers. Your daughter has that blond hair, so very likely you are the father.

            "answer_text": "Probably the blonde hair gene is passed down from any of your ancestors. For you the blond hair gene was hidden but it became the prominent genome factor for your daughter. And that's how she became the blonde half asian. It's the reason based on biology. and no offense but the case might be your wife cheated on you with someone with natural blonde hair. But you should probably get the DNA test and don't accuse anyone without any evidence. ",
