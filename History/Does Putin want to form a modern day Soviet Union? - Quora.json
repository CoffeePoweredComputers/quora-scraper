            "answer_text": "Definitely not. The Soviet Union was a non-commercial project of revolutionary transformation of society along the Marxist ideas of abolition of private property. It was enormously costly\u2014both in terms of human lives and wasted wealth\u2014and effectively bankrupted the third generation of Soviet rulers. President Putin is a very commercially-aware politician and a professed anti-Communist. He knows the modern Russia can\u2019t possibly afford a re-run of the Soviet project. He sees no reason to even contemplate it. Besides, the history of the Soviet demise in the 1980s, early 1990s shows that ethnic nationalism in the former non-Russian Soviet republics is an unsurmountable force for even trying to corral them back into the rigid hierarchical system of Russian governance. Cartoon below: in the Soviet satirical tradition, ethnic nationalists enjoyed the ugliest visual palette of all, comparable maybe only to Nazis and Trostkyists. This cartoon, titled \u201cFamily portrait. One flesh\u201d, presents American Imperialism nurturing the most dangerous sort of nationalists (as seen through the Soviet lens). To the left, a Ukrainian, with a German WW2 gun, swastikas for ethnic decoration on his Vyshiv\u00e1nka shirt and a studio mike signed \u201cRadio Liberty\u201d. To the right, a Zionist in a snazzy dress with Tora-styled \u201cPlans of Aggression\u201d and a sack of ample American aid. The bomb the American is sitting on is a Neutron bomb, wickedly effective at killing people, but sparing inanimate objects.  ",
