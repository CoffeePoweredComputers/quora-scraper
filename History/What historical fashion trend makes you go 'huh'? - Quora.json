            "answer_text": "Crinolines:[1] Crinolines were a huge fashion statement in the 19th century and early 20th century and worn by every social class. They were designed to replace the heavy petticoats of earlier periods with a more lightweight alternative, making it more comfortable for the wearer and providing more mobility, and removing the need for tight corsets. They look beautiful (aside from looking like anyone wearing them would have to pass sideways through narrow doors) but however, crinolines were actually quite dangerous. For example, there are several reports of women\u2019s crinolines being caught inside the spokes of carriage wheels, therefore allowing them to be dragged through the streets. They were also incredibly flammable, in a time when kitchen fires were common. One such example is the 14-year-old Margaret Davey, whose dress, enlarged by a crinoline, caught fire as she stood on the fender of the fireplace in order to get some spoons, and the flames eventually consumed her. Of the 3,000 crinoline-related deaths that occurred during its era of peak popularity, which was around the 1850\u2019s and 1860\u2019s, the vast majority of them had to do with fires.  Chopines:[2] If you thought those heels you wore at the last formal party you attended were quite the struggle, than you probably can\u2019t imagine having your feet in these! The unusual-looking platform shoes known as chopines were fashionable in 16th-century Venice among patrician and courtesan women. They were initially designed to help the wearer\u2019s feet cross muddy and damp streets without getting wet, and the tallest chopines suggested that the wearer was one of very great wealth and social status \u2014 in fact, some surviving chopines came to be about 20 inches (50 cm) high! Sometimes one needed an attendant to keep her from falling down due to the soaring height of the shoes. In fact, there\u2019s also a quote from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, poking fun at the trend: \u201cYour ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine\u201d \u2014 implying that the character had grown a whole lot since the last time he saw her.  Radium-based cosmetics: During the 1920\u2019s and 30\u2019s, radium was all the rage as the discovery of that element by the Curie\u2019s had generated considerable scientific interest. Radium was used in a variety of products, and cosmetics were no exceptions. For a while it was thought that the rays that radium would give off had an invigorating and energizing effect on the skin. The French company Tho-Radia produced a booklet containing the following quote: It stimulates cellular vitality, activates circulation, firms skin, eliminates fats, stops enlarged pores forming, stops and cures boils, pimples, redness, pigmentation, protects from the elements, stops ageing and gets rid of wrinkles, conserves the freshness and brightness of the complexion. [3] Eventually the desire for radium waned as we found out that it caused drastic health effects such as cataracts, anemia, cancer and death.  Footnotes[1] Rebecca N.

            "answer_text": "18th Century Makeup For hundreds of years in Europe, it was fashionable to have pale skin, to prove you were wealthy enough to stay indoors and not have to work outside. In the 18th century, this look became far more exaggerated when men and women started to use makeup to further whiten their skin and cover up any blemishes. .  Picture source: Morley Makeup Artistry This look was achieved in the following ways: WHITE SKIN Many different types of creams, ointments, and \u2018chemical washes\u2019 were sold that promised to bleach and lighten the skin, removing and hiding all blemishes in the process. White makeup was also used - a very thick foundation that was liberally applied to the face and chest area. Women often painted blue veins onto their bosoms to further enhance the \u2018pale and interesting\u2019 look. Some foundations contained pretty harmless ingredients but the most popular foundations contained lead as they gave a more desirable look. One interesting recipe for lead face powder goes as follows: Steep the lead in the pot of vinegar, and rest it in a bed of manure for at least three weeks. When the lead finally softens to the point where it can be pounded into a flaky white powder (a chemical reaction between vinegar and lead causes lead to turn white), grind to a fine powder. Mix with water, and let dry in the sun. After the powder is dry, mix with the appropriate amount of perfume and tinting dye.[1] People knew that using lead face powder was poisonous but shockingly still continued to use it. In fact, several English socialites actually died from its use, including Maria Gunning, Countess of Coventry who died aged 27 in 1760. . .ROUGED CHEEKS Like the white makeup, there was a variety of rouge mixtures made from harmless ingredients out there. The fashion, however, was to have brilliant red cheeks, and again to achieve this, the best recipe was made from toxic ingredients. One very popular rouge had a vermilion base \u2014 vermilion is made from the mineral cinnabar, also known as mercury sulfide. A quote from 1760 The Art of Beauty advising against vermilion-based rouge: \u2018it is very dangerous; for by using it frequently they may lose their teeth, acquire a stinking breath, and excite a copious salivation\u2019 . .EYEBROWS The \u2018perfect\u2019 eyebrow was seen to be thin and tapered, in a half-moon shape, and drawn anywhere. Frequently darkened, lead, soot, and burnt cork amongst other things could be used. If eyebrow plucking had gone overboard \u2014 well, a fancy new pair made from mouse skin was stuck on instead. Attractive. A famous quote by Jonathan Swift describes a woman\u2019s \u2018eyebrows from a mouse\u2019s hide, stuck on with art on either side\u2019. . So the historical fashion trend for me that makes me go \u2018huh\u2019 is toxic makeup \u2014 because they knew it was toxic. If it didn\u2019t kill you, it caused a receding hairline, skin discolouration, rotten teeth, abdominal pain, and constipation among others. Dying in vain! Footnotes[1] Lead Face Powder",
