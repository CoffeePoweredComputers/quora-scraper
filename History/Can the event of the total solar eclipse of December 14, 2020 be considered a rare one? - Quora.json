Solar eclipses happen all the time - just that total eclipses near where you live are pretty uncommon. There\u2019s 2 solar eclipses this year. The one on Dec 14 will be a total eclipse, as opposed to June 21\u2019s annular eclipse. You\u2019re going to need to be on a cruise ship or in Chile or Argentina to see totality in December, however. ",
