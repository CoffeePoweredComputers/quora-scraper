            "answer_text": "This is because there was a huge difference in the Italian effort made to take Ethiopia between the 1st and 2nd wars. The first Italian Ethiopian war was basically a small Italian army of 15,000 men whose commander made a the blunder of splitting his forces and putting them out in the open against a force of Ethiopians that outnumbered the Italians perhaps 5 to 1. The separated Italians in the open were destroyed as was the other half which went to the rescue. So there you go. In the first war the force sent in was too small and abysmally led. Now for the second Italian Ethiopian war. This one was much bigger and bloodier and this time the Italians and their native allies invaded Ethiopia with a modern army over 250,000 men strong. They had tanks and complete air supremacy. The Ethiopian armies, who did still have more men, had pretty much nothing else. They had ancient weapons, very few modern rifles, no tanks, and no air force. They could not hope to stop the Italians the way they did in 1896. Their armies were destroyed one after another on the ground and constantly harassed from the air as the Italian army pressed further and further into Ethiopia finally taking its capital and causing its emperor to flee. In about 6 months and costing relatively light Italian casualties they had taken Ethiopia. The differences in the first war and second are obvious. The first one with merely 15,000 men and not much else. Poorly led, engulfed, and annihilated. The second war saw Mussolini's military in action and he was taking no chances on anything but victory. 250,000 troops, numerous tanks, the Italian air force controlled the skies (and dropped gas on the fleeing tribesmen just to increase their casualties. They were adequately led as well. This gave Ethiopia, the last free African nation at that time, no chance for victory against the technologically superior Italians who were employing all the weapons of modern warfare against the brave but barefooted Ethiopian tribesmen who had spears and at best had rifles from the turn of the century. So the difference was simply a far larger and better equipped army. Modern weapons like tanks, artillery, and airplanes. The Ethiopians were slaughtered with figures of up to 275,000 military men dead and 500,000 civilians. That's in comparison to about 10,000 Italian soldiers lost. ",

            "answer_text": "That was a battle, not \u201cthe war\u201d. Catholics wanted Ethiopia to submit to the Pope, because they knew/know that, Hercules, Leonidas the Spartan, Xerxes the Babylonian, and Alexander the Macedonian all descended from Andromeda the Ethiopian. Also, they know that Troy belonged to the family of Laomedon (Priam was the last king, but Memnon was the eldest brother of Priam, and Memnon ruled in Ethiopia). Also they\u2019re afraid of Homer\u2019s account of Hades. Homer described men being granted immortality, men being raised from death, men\u2019s souls being simultaneously in Mt. Olympus and in Hades, and men traveling in and out of Hades without dying. Memnon was one such who died in the Trojan War, but was raised from death, and given immortality, and brought to Mt. Olympus. He also was a son of a goddess. For example, Odysseus travelled while still alive into Hades, and returned home safely. Achilles died in the war and went to Hades and remains there. Also they\u2019re afraid of Ancient Adulis, because there used to be Ethiopians who really worshipped Ares, Zeus, and Poseidon. In the Iliad and the Odyssey it is clear that those gods favor most the Ethiopians, even though the word is used infrequent. There was a king of Adulis in the 3rd c. BCE who claimed to be a son of Ares, the god of war. Shoot, even the Buddha lived in India when India and Ethiopia were one kingdom, according to Esther the Jew, and it is clear that Kharosthi and Brahmi subjects travelled the Red Sea around the time of Christ. In Islam, an Ethiopian entered Allah\u2019s paradise before Prophet Muhammad, even in Ancient Akele Guzai, it is clear that there was a Mukarrib king in the 10th c. BCE who ruled over both Sabians and Ge\u2019ez subjects, and when South Arabia was a colony of a renegade Aksumite governor in the 6th c. CE, he had knowledge of it. In Judaism, YHWH allowed Solomon\u2019s temple to be destroyed in Jerusalem because of what the Hebrews did to Prophet Jeremiah, whereas YHWH promised Ebed-Melech salvation. In Christianity, the Jewish Ethiopian Eunuch was sent for by the Lamb of God to accept baptism, before Saul converted to Christianity, or became the apostle to gentiles. In Tewahedo Christianity, a copy of a manuscript written in the 13th c. AD described that the Byzantines and Aksum would divide the world into two kingdoms and two kings in the Apocalypse when Christ returns, and reign with Jesus. Solomon himself was anointed king of Judah and Israel in Ethiopia according ecumenically, the queen of Sheba visited him, Moses wrote that there was a grandson of Ethiopia named Sheba, and Tewahedo Christianity recorded the whole story. A Zagwe Christian king built a New Jerusalem in Lalibela circa 10th-13th c. AD (the Aksumite dark age) and indeed Abyssinia/Ethiopia has never been conquered since. For example America has military bases all over the world, and doesn\u2019t have control. The President has DEFCOM measures in place if D.C. is taken, and Selassie was killed by want to be socialist-turned-tyrant military commanders. Tigrinya Tigrayan Ethiopians, not Mussolini. Prophet Muhammad said that Prophet Enoch was the first man to ever write, fragments of identical copies of the Book of Enoch were found at the Qumran Cave Dead Sea Scrolls and in Ethiopia, whereas Ethiopia only has a full manuscript. Moses wrote that Nimrod was a king in Ancient Mesopotamia, whereas Moses wrote that YHWH provided a ram instead of Isaac, whereas Daniel wrote that the Ram were the Persians and Medes, whereas Jesus wrote that a wicked generation seeks a sign, whereas Muhammad said that al-qiyamah will not come until the Muslims fight the Turks; and indeed Kurdistan is a war zone; indeed ISIL is destroying Ancient Ethiopian temples in Nineveh, where cuneiform was used. The Amhara/Tigrinyan dispute also goes back to the Rashidun Caliphate ie. 8th c. AD, but not further. Ezekiel wrote that the Suez Canal would be reopened in the days of Gog and Magog, and indeed, WWIII is next. The archangel Gabriel came to Daniel swiftly and in weariness to explain to him the vision of the Jewish Messiah and told Daniel that wars were decreed to the end, and another global flood, and indeed the ice caps are melting.
