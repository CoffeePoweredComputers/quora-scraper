            "answer_text": "Alex, Good question, actually during the later 20\u2019s the German economy was growing at a nice rapid pace, and Hitler was losing votes at the poll. The concept of a democracy was very new and uncomfortable to most Germans because they were use to a monarchy. Well 1929 the collapse of the stock market made Hitler look real good because he somewhat predicted it would happen in Mein Kampf and his popularity started to rise again. If the market had not fallen and things went on smoothly around the world it\u2019s possible the Weimar Republic could have survived, but also throw into the mix, Japan and their ambitions for a greater East Asian co prosperity sphere, wow the possibilities are endless. Who\u2019s to say what could\u2019ve been, but a good question . ",

            "answer_text": "While this question sounds academic, it is perhaps the most profound question now facing the world\u2019s democracies. And the answer is no, Weimar almost certainly was doomed from the start. The reason? Republics require (small \u2019r\u2019) republicans. Democracy requires (small \u2019d\u2019) democrats. Weimar lacked the essential core of citizens willing to work defending relevant institutions. Absent that commitment, a republic withers and does. ",
