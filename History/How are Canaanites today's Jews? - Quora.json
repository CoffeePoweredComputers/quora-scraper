            "answer_text": "Canaanites are today\u2019s Jews; the original Canaanites were not Arab. The Canaanites, including the original Jebusites and the invading Philistines, adopted the Hebrew belief under a peace treaty with King David. Many Philistines and Non-Hebrew Canaanites acquired prominent positions in David\u2019s armies. In the 8th century BCE, all of the peoples of the Northern Kingdom became exiled in the Assyrian invasion and constitute the Lost Tribes of Israel. Thereby, all Canaanites and Philistines in the aftermath of battles that culminated in King David\u2019s victory and establishment of the Kingdom of Israel in 1002 BCE, constitute today\u2019s surviving Jews. There are no historical imprints of the Arab group yet existing in King David\u2019s time. [10]. Refs. \u201cThey (the Philistines) met with a severe defeat, however, early in the reign of David (2 Samuel 5:20), he succeeded in reducing them to a state of vassalage (2 Samuel 8:1). In the year of the fall of Samaria (721 B.C.) they became vassals of Sargon. After the time of the Assyrians the Philistines cease to be mentioned by this name. In the ebb and flow of warring nations over this land it is more than probable that they were gradually absorbed and lost their identity. \u2013 [The Catholic Encyl.). / The Philistine cities lost their independence to Assyria, and revolts in following years were all crushed. [Myers 1997, p. 313.] / The theory of the \u201cLost Ten Tribes\u201d calls for (1) all inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom of Hoshea to be deported by Shalmaneser and Sargon, 722-718 B.C [Hearyhim, Weebly, Armstrongism] / They (the Canaanites) were indeed assimilated into the Israelite nation. When the Assyrians overran the Kingdom of Israel, they did not leave any Canaanite aside, as they had all become Israelites by that time. Therefore, the only people that can trace back a lineage to the ancient Canaanites are the Jews. The Canaanites did not exist any longer after the 8th century b.c.e. and they were not annihilated but assimilated into the Jewish people. \u2013 [The True Identity of the So-called Palestinians, imninalu] / The Bible describes the Philistines as remaining \u201csubdued\u201d during David\u2019s reign [Philistine; New World Enycl.]/ Josephus, Antiquities, Book 11, Ch.1] & [Esdras 13:39] \u201cPhilistine-To-Palestine\u201d https://www.amazon.com/Philistine\u2014Palestine-Exposing-Biggest-Deception-ebook/dp/B01B9B482Y/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8 ",

            "answer_text": "Biblically, this may be hard to determine. \u201cJews\u201d refer to the lineage of Judah (one of Jacob\u2019s twelve sons). In Genesis chapter 38, we first learn of Judah begetting his children (\u201cJews\u201d). Judah marries a Canaanite woman, and they have three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah. As the firstborn comes to age, Judah marries his son Er to Tamar. Tamar\u2019s ethnicity is undisclosed. (Note: this ambiguity may be of importance, because she is not identified as a Canaanite, such as Judah\u2019s wife is\u2014and thus Judah\u2019s offspring through her also are Canaanite.) Before Er might beget children, God found him to be wicked; Er died, and Tamar was left childless. (Tamar did not produce any Canaanite children.) According to old custom, if a wife be widowed and left childless, her brother-in-law is obligated to provide seed as substitute for her deceased husband; to secure her with an inheritance by way of producing children through his brother\u2019s name. Next in line was the brother Onan whose purpose was to beget Er\u2019s children through Tamar. While acting on his duty, he had second thoughts, and spilled his seed on the ground. Once again, Tamar was without child, and Onan died too. (Tamar did not produce any Canaanite children a second time.) Now Judah had only one son remaining. Fearing that his daughter-in-law was a curse unto his lineage, he withheld Shelah from Tamar. And about this time Judah\u2019s Canaanite wife died. As time went by, and Tamar understood that her father-in-law was keeping his last son from fulfilling his duty, she disguised herself as a harlot, and enticed Judah by the wayside. She was veiled and her father-in-law did not recognize her. Judah (who was not a Canaanite) begot Zerah and Perez by his daughter-in-law Tamar (who was never identified as a Canaanite). ",
