            "answer_text": "The Gregory of the Gregorian calendar was Pope Gregory XIII. The calendar was adopted throughout Roman Catholic countries in Europe in October, 1582. Protestant England was, at that time, ruled by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth I. England was not about to heed this papal decree, even if it fixed the accumulated error in the Julian calendar relative to the seasons. No, England would not conform for nearly 200 years. The change, for England and its colonies, was made in October, 1752. The removal of the eleven days was needed because there were too many leap years (and hence too many extra days) in the Julian calendar. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the British had to adopt a new calendar named Gregorian calendar. By 1 January 1752, they were still stuck in Julius Caesar\u2019s creation. They had been 170 years late from others. But, if not now, then when? By 1752, there was 11-day difference between those two. So, to catch up with the Greogorian club, the British and her colonies had to leap through 3 to 13 September 1752. So, when Londoners went to sleep at night of 2 September 1752, they would wake up in the morning of 14 September 1752. These men had become time traveler overnight, just by sleeping.
