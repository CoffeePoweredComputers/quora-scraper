            "answer_text": "The Bible does not use the term \u201ccaveman\u201d or \u201cNeanderthals,\u201d and according to the Bible there is no such thing as \u201cprehistoric\u201d man. The term \u201cprehistoric\u201d means \u201cbelonging to the era before recorded history.\u201d It presupposes that the biblical account is merely a fabrication, because the book of Genesis records events which precede the creation of man (namely, the first five days of creation\u2014man was created on the sixth day). The Bible is clear that Adam and Eve were perfect humans from the time of their creation and did not evolve from lower life forms. With that said, the Bible does describe a period of traumatic upheaval upon the earth\u2014the flood (Genesis 6-9), during which time civilization was utterly destroyed except for eight people. Humanity was forced to start over. It is in this historical context that some scholars believe men lived in caves and made use of stone tools. These men were not primitive; they were simply destitute. And they certainly were not half ape. The fossil evidence is quite clear: cavemen were human\u2014men who lived in caves. There are some fossilized ape remains which Darwinian paleo-anthropologists interpret as being some sort of transition between ape and men. Most people seem to think of these interpretations when they imagine cavemen. They picture furry half-men, half-ape creatures crouched in a cave next to a fire, drawing on the walls with their newly developed stone tools. This is a common misconception. And as far as Darwinian paleo-anthropology goes, we should keep in mind that these interpretations reflect a peculiar worldview and are not the result of the evidence. In fact, not only is there major opposition to these interpretations within the academic community, the Darwinists themselves do not entirely agree with each other on the details. Unfortunately, the popular mainstream view promotes this idea that man and ape both evolved from the same ancestor, but this is certainly not the only plausible interpretation of the available evidence. In fact, the evidence in favor of this particular interpretation is lacking. When God created Adam and Eve, they were fully developed human beings, capable of communication, society, and development (Genesis 2:19-25; 3:1-20; 4:1-12). It is almost entertaining to consider the lengths evolutionary scientists go to prove the existence of prehistoric cavemen. They find a misshapen tooth in a cave and from that create a misshapen human being who lived in a cave, hunched over like an ape. There is no way that science can prove the existence of cavemen by a fossil. Evolutionary scientists simply have a theory, and then they force the evidence to fit the theory. Adam and Eve were the first human beings ever created and were fully-formed, intelligent, and upright. What does the Bible say about cavemen, prehistoric men, neanderthals? ",

Do you think God would exclude someone from heaven based on where they live? No! But of course the question is referring to cavemen from the past, such as Neandertals. These people were descendants of Adam and Eve. They had a sin nature the same as you and I. If they trusted in Jesus Christ as their Savior, they are brothers and sisters in the Lord, who will be with us in eternity. ",

When mankind began to build dwellings is not mentioned in the Bible, so there may very well have been many generations of cave-dwellers in Hebrew prehistory. But then again, ancient Hebrews didn\u2019t believe in heaven or hell, and we still have no evidence these places actually exist. ",
