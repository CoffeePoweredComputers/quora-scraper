            "answer_text": "Other commenters have mentioned some advantages that made the Aztecs the most powerful people in Mesoamerica before the Spanish conquest in 1519. But they neglected to highlight the one huge basic advantage the Aztecs and their three-city alliance had over other major kingdoms and tribes in Mesoamerica\u2014food production. If one goes back for a good 1,500 years before the Spanish conquest, one sees a recurring pattern in Central Mexican civilizations\u2014the most powerful political entities were almost always centered in or near the Valley of Mexico. Teotihuacan, which grew to be an enormous city of 250,000 people, culturally (and possibly politically?) dominating kingdoms and regions all the way to modern-day Honduras (Copan) and Belize (Caracol) nearly 900 miles away, was in the northern Valley of Mexico, close to the Aztec Triple-Alliance city of Texcoco. It had an iron grip on the region from around 0 CE to around 500 CE. The same with the Toltecs\u2014Tula, their grand capital, was just north of the Valley of Mexico. They were as long-lived as Teotihuacan, controlling the region from around 600 CE to 1000 CE, and were not as powerful as the Aztecs. But they still held the very valuable agricultural lands of the Valley of Mexico. And then came the Aztecs, who settled right in the middle of the valley, which was the opposite of what the Teotihuacanos and Toltecs, who settled on the valley sides, had done. Suffice to say, the base for Aztec power, and the power of the Toltecs and Teotihuacanos before them, was control over the Valley of Mexico. And the Valley of Mexico was very valuable because it could produce vast amounts of food relative to other similarly-sized regions in Mexico. The fertility of the valley was renown\u2014the Aztecs (and very likely the Toltecs and Teotihuacanos before them) practiced the intensive agricultural method of chinampas, which were \u201cfloating gardens\u201d of extremely high fertility that were built in the marshy fringes of Lake Texcoco in the middle of the valley. The Aztecs took these chinampas and build them out much more aggressively than any previous civilization. This produced consistent huge harvests, which fed their people. The fine temperate climate of the valley, along with its rich, thick volcanic soils and a huge lake that provided freshwater for crops year-round, meant that the growing season was perennial. This was unlike in the tropical lowlands where the other major Mesoamerican civilizations were located (like the Maya). There the soils were naturally thin, the dry seasons did not permit the growing of much food for part of the year, and the sources of water were more erratic since they depended too much on seasonal rainfall. More food obviously meant a population explosion, and the more Aztec warriors there were, the easier it was for them to conquer their neighbors and then to expand out into the rest of Mexico. It\u2019s been estimated that on the eve of the Spanish conquest there were around 10 to 15 million people in Mexico, and that around 2 to 4 million clustered in the Valley of Mexico, on tiny plots of land, with Tenochtitlan in the middle of the vast agricultural complex, a city of 200,000 to 300,000 people. Even today, the fertility of the Valley of Mexico has made a deep impact on modern-day Mexico\u2014Mexico City, which now fills up most of the valley, represents 25% of the Mexican economy and has close to 20% of Mexico\u2019s total population. Mexico City became by far and away the most dominant city under Spanish colonial rule because the fertility of the soils around it allowed it to grow food surpluses to support the large population required to dominate the other regions of Mexico.

            "answer_text": "The Aztecs had a highly developed system of government centered in the capital city of Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City) with a powerful emperor who was worshipped as a god. The city council in the capital also acted as a governmental body similar to the Roman Senate and headed by the emperor. Along with Tenochtitlan, a Triple Alliance was formed with the powerful cities of Texcoco and Tlacopan. Together they ruled a system of conquered city-states that paid tribute to the three cities of the alliance and the emperor. These vassal cities maintained a high degree of autonomy provided that tribute was paid each year. The cities were divided into regions (or families in the countryside) known as calpulli. The leaders of the calpulli would, in turn, form city council who were responsible for governing the city and seeing to its administration, ie providing schools and collecting taxes. The city councils were also charged with mustering forces during military campaigns lead by the emperor. In addition, they would lead attacks on surrounding areas to take captives to be sacrificed in religious ceremonies. In return for their loyalty, the conquered cities benefited through steady, reliable trade and good infrastructure. The complex and efficient governmental system of the empire was one of the primary factors that lead to their becoming the dominant force in the Valley of Mexico, ruling over a population of more than a million people. Other groups in the region were far less organized and far smaller than the Aztec Empire which left them susceptible to conquest. ",
