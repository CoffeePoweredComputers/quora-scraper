            "answer_text": "I think this is a huge question which demand a far more detailed answer than could be given in a brief Quoran answer. Let us assume that the questioner is actually asking about the Western Roman Empire in order to further simplify the potential answer. I believe that the western empire fell for a number of reasons. I would suggest that the later political instability was a symptom rather than a fundamental cause of the failure. The empire, like any other empire, or indeed nation requires a coherent internal logic to support its continued existence. This means that it has to be in the interests of the constituent parts to remain united and therefore occasionally sacrifice their own perceived interests for the greater good. As soon as economic pressures emerge at such a level to disrupt this commonweal approach, local political representation withdraws its support from the central government. I think economic and hence political pressures prevented the continuation of a unified state. These pressure could almost certainly not have been prevented. Like all states for a large proportion of human history, the Empire depended on the successful creation of an agricultural surplus largely sustained by a slave economy. Rome\u2019s initial success derived from its ability to sustain a standing professional army ready to put down rebellion, defend the borders and ensure a steady supply of slaves. But all this came at a substantial cost and therefore entailed an effective taxation system applied to the enhanced trade facilitated especially in the Mediterranean. The division of the Empire into two main parts was probably a consequence of the fundamental differences that became apparent between the Western Latin dialect speakers and the Eastern Greek dialect speakers. This strain had probably always been present but, under strain, the split became almost inevitable. The strain seems to have originated in a problem similar to that which we face today viz. climate adversity. It seems that a continued period of poor climatic conditions as far away as Central Asia had led to the movement of peoples in search of better conditions. This naturally implied war and the consequent movement westward of other peoples and tribes. Pressure therefore built up on the borders of the Western Empire. Hence we see continued attempts by peoples such as Goths and Huns to move inside the imperial border. Unfortunately, the western empire had been fundamentally weakened by the loss of the resources of the Eastern Empire as well as being adversely affected by the climate change conditions. Although there were initial attempts by the East to support the West, eventually these attempts could not be sustained given that the East also faced border challenges. It seems likely that the continued dilution of the army with forces that primarily owed their allegiance elsewhere would have led to less cultural and political loyalty to the empire. Certainly, it could be theorised that continuation of a single empire could have allowed more effective \u2018policing\u2019 of the borders by facilitating cross-subsidy of resource to the defences in North Africa and along the Rhine-Danube. However, the inability to sustain a significant agricultural surplus would have meant that taxation available to support the standing army was reduced. It has been argued that inflation, inadequate supply of slaves, intensive bureaucracy and corruption exacerbated the situation and these may all have played a part but I would suggest that is primarily economic factors which facilitate the creation of empires and when the climate made life more difficult across the empire as well as the continent, then the redirection of resources to more local structures became irresistible. I hope the above has not been too superficial and I would be most interested in other views. ",

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of ways that the fall of the Roman Empire could have been avoided. I would say that the principle factors that made the fall of the Roman Empire certain were: The Sack of Constantinople in 1204, the loss of Anatolia to the Ottoman Turks, and the Second Palaiologian Civil War. The Sack of 1204 was a truly horrific blow; Supposed allies took the capital city by assault, subjected it to rape and plunder, stole a millennium of accumulated wealth, destroyed libraries, barracks, technological codices and more besides, and then they took over the rule of the city for themselves, and through 62 years of incompetent mismanagement these Robber-Barrons reduced the city\u2019s population by something like 70%, utterly destroyed the economy of Constantinople and the surrounding regions, and forever ended the possibility of the Romans becoming a pre-eminent power once again. This event could, realistically, be avoided by either the assassination of the pretender to the Imperial Purple who was the pretext for the attack, by the Romans themselves refraining from engaging in racist and nationalist attacks on the Italian trading companies, or by the Angelus family never becoming the Imperial house in the first place; such was the immense malignancy of their incompetent rule. The loss of Anatolia resulted in the wealthiest and most populous remaining parts of the Empire forever leaving Imperial control. This one really is very easy to prevent. All the Romans need to do is win the Battle of Pelekanon which really was little more than a minor skirmish going by the numbers; even this late in it\u2019s history the 2,000 men the Emperor Andronikos devoted to the campaign was a small part of the full Roman military. And seriously? Whilst the Romans were quite heavily outnumbered, they were still amongst the best soldiers in Europe at that time; They were well armed and armoured, well trained, and had thousands of years of military knowledge backing them up. But thanks to the vagaries of battle, the common men mistakenly thought the Emperor had been killed and fled. The real problem was the consequences for Roman morale; After this they gave up on reconquering their lost territories, and the last major city of Bythinia under Roman control, Nikomedia, was lost to the Turks shortly afterwards. All that needs to happen is that the Emperor Andronikos remains visible throughout the battle and the Turks are defeated. The Second Palaiologian Civil War happened shortly after the death of Andronikos some ten or so years later. Factions rose up around the Empress-Dowager and the Co-Emperor-and-Grand-Domestic (Prime minister) who engaged in a completely ruinous war for control of the child-emperor. In this time the Romans lost almost all of Greece to the Serbs, most of Thrace to the Bulgarians, and then all three lost all of that to the Turks in very short order. And the Black Death also happened. Which is not a trivial thing. This one is most absolutely the event that changed the Roman Empire from \u201csomething that could still survive to the modern day\u201d to \u201csomething that will certainly cease to exist within the next century\u201d, which it did, just over a century later if I am being accurate, on the 29th of May 1453. It is much more difficult to find a way around this event if the preceding two happen as historically. Ideally either the Empress-Dowager or Co-Emperor need to find some way to die within a month or so of the death of Andronikos III. Achieve this and the factions probably disperse for the most part whilst the remaining potentate educates the young Ioannes III Palaiologos. In this way the Serbians are prevented from conquering Greece and the Turks remain in Anatolia. This gives the Roman Empire some breathing space, and gives it some potential to survive in to modern times as a larger and somewhat wealthier \u201cGreece\u201d. ",
