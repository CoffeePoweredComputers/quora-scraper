            "answer_text": "Aisha, you ask a wonderfully complicated question. Here is how it gets complicated. Hinduism is not one unified religion like some branches of Christians, Islam, or others. We have many books which are sacred and some are being written right now. Whilst it is is true they accord with the Vedas, this is not necessarily always the truth. There are lots of similarities between Hindus such as rituals, utsavs, and more, know that between all the Hindus in he world vast oceans of belief and philosophy may exist. With my friends, we have never talked religion except for one friend who had a similar mindset as myself. Traditions exist in many places and this is one of the many jewels of the Hindu religion. On a basic level, a Hindu must accept the Vedas as authoritative. Some will argue this, but again traditions are being expressed at that point. There is one God,but many expressions of that One God. Brahman is the eternal, ultimate reality. All souls are part of this eternal, ultimate reality. We try to live our dharma (spiritual path) according to what life has given us. Reincarnation and moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirths), karma too. The live stages, or purusharthas are important, artha (work for the attainment of livelihood), and yoga is important. All Hindus follow these eternal duties: honesty, refraining from injuring living beings, patience, forbearance, self-restraint, and compassion. There are others. I hope this helps you, Aisha. ",

            "answer_text": "For a start Hinduism is not a religion. Hindus actually are the people who live by the Indus valley and later came to known as Hindus. But talking about their religion, Vedantists and Puranists in the sense, I find it surprising how hindus in todays world have manipulated the teachings (like all other major religions) for their own benefits. Hinduism (lets call it that way to understand) has a few major beliefs which ties to almost all the major religions. Commoners i will say: There is One GODBut that GOD has forms (Avatars)God resides in all the things he created (Like Muslims, Allah\u2019s mercy resides in his creation)God is in every human being (This is my fav)Hindus Worship these avatars as they think it takes them closer to GodHindus have a very different concept of afterlife, basically reincarnation until you reach the Mokhsa (Salvation) Roughly 7 reincarnations.These are few mentioned who i think are the most interesting and important beliefs of Hinduism as a religion today. But I believe every religion is a branch, and it goes to one tree. The GOD that made us all.. Peace! ",
