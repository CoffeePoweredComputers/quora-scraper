            "answer_text": "Louis XVI reminds me of Tsar Nicholas II. A person of average ability, who was born into a position that he wasn\u2019t really able to handle, at a time that even a person of extraordinary ability would have found challenging. Louis was not hated in the way his wife was hated. Marie Antoinette was truly despised. When the royal couple were captured and brought to the Tuileries, the crowd beheaded Marie Antionette\u2019s best friend, put her head on a pike, and banged the severed head agains the windows of the rooms where the royal couple was being held. They wanted her to suffer. Louis was not hated in this way, but he was seen as a weak ruler, at a time when people felt in crisis and wanted strong leadership. His indecisiveness was largely responsible for the failure of the royal couple\u2019s escape attempt in June of 1791. He dithered and kept postponing the escape, believing erroneously that he was beloved by the \u201csilent majority\u201d of peasants. When he did try to escape, he was caught, and the failed escape attempt added to the sense people had that the King wasn\u2019t really on their side. When the revolutionary French government went to war against Austria and Prussia, the Austrians and Prussians inadvertently made things worse for Louis by announcing their intention to restore Louis to his full power. Since Marie Antoinette was Austrian, this added to the sense that Louis\u2019 interests and France\u2019s interests were not aligned. But the real problem was the same problem that led to the death of the Romanovs in Russia in 1917. So long as the royal family existed, they were always going to be perceived as a threat to the new regime. And again, Louis was his own worst enemy. He was caught with correspondence with foreign leaders that suggested that he was indeed colluding with the enemy. That was the last straw. He faced his execution in the guillotine with grace, and was buried in a mass grave. There were some who lamented his passing, but in general he was not missed. He was the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. ",

He suddenly turned, yelling that he forgave his murderers and hoped that blood would not ever be spilled like this. He was cut short by the revolutionaries, tacitly signaling the nearby soldiers to beat their drums to drown out their sovereign\u2019s voice. The members of the assembly, when voting on Louis XVI\u2019s trial, decided that his sentence would be death. Most of the members, including Robespierre, as their were casting their vote on his execution, said that they were doing it with great sadness and regret. The French nobility and the rest of Europe was completely horrified and outraged. It only spurred on the war between Revolutionary France and the old Monarchies. ",

Louis XVI had in fact never been hated although he had been a frequent laughing stock for his apparent apathy, his stoutness and supposed penchant for hard drinking, among many other things. The French still retained a hint of respect for him and, therefore, he was treated accordingly on his last day. His wife was a whole other kettle of fish: she was carried to the scaffold in a cattle cart and insults were heaped on her throughout her journey. It took many decades, even centuries, to somewhat rehabilitate her as the person she truly was. ",
