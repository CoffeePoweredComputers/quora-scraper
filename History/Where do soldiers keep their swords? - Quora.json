At O4 you are expected to have a sword for those functions that warrant it. That being said, it\u2019s usually in your closet at home, maybe next to your golf clubs, or perhaps in the basement. You will undoubtable never need it if you bring it with you but if you chose to leave it home, you will get picked to do some dumb parade in a foreign port and get stuck needing it. I was told the sword was removed asa required uniform item at the start of WWII to conserve steel. This link below from the US NAVY history page seems to bear that out as well. Swords ",

Even as ceremonial items, they seem to be fading from the picture. I find it a bit ironic that the Navy resurrected the Chief Petty Officer's Cutlass some years after I retired.
