            "answer_text": "That should be a minimal charge if you bring the replacement sight with you to the gunshop. If not the gunsmith will likely charge you for the time & trouble to order one, plus the labor to install it. Installation requires simply removing the sight pin and pressing off the old sight. Then pressing on the new sight and reinstalling the sight pin. It is not usually a big problem and takes only a few minutes. Ordering one is another thing entirely. First he would have to spend the time finding & ordering one. Then there would be a minimum shipping charge and the delay in days or weeks while he has your gun in his shop before he could do it. It is not too difficult to do yourself, but normally a gunsmith will have the sight tool used to press the taper pin out. That can of course be done at home with the right sized brass punch. But you MUST punch it out from the small end of the pin if it has a solid pin. Some later issues used a roll pin that can come out either side. Then often the sight will not slide off easily, but you can drive it off using a soft mallet. Not something that you would want to try at home unless you are mechanically inclined. ",

            "answer_text": "I typically do not mark up more than 2% on part cost (depends on how long it took to find), labor would be for something like that 0.5 hrs. so for my shop $30 plus part+shipping. So maybe like $35\u201340 with the prices I am seeing on the sight blade. Every shop is a bit different I will let you bring in your own parts then typically work up a quote for you for the work. Once you sign off I perform the work then you pay when you pick it up. If you take more than 30 days to pick something up I may charge a storage fee or interest on any parts orders out of my pocket. Most of the time though folks will pay for the parts up front then labor once the repair is done. ",
