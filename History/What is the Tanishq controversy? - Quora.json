            "answer_text": " I think I can\u2019t afford this over priced TATA products because I feel the resale value of the jewellery is same as Tata cars. Since, I am not the TG they aren\u2019t targeting me therefore, the so called Ganga-Jamuni ads isn\u2019t going to change my decision. For me, jewelleries are still part of investment.  In the world of eyeball drawing business and recent clients brief - \u201cWe need viral videos\u201d agencies delivers it. I still remember P&G is champion of this narrative. Just recall, sharetheload, touchthepickle, Thankyoumom ads you can\u2019t find even a single frame that doesn\u2019t drives the purpose of advertising. Let me share one more example of ad that had rocked the world without touching the religious aspect.   Angel vs. Devil! In my opinion, the Tanishq ad is nothing but gimmick to garner few award or reach the Cannes podium. It has garnered huge backlash with scale (not business) of reach. I have read a term \u201cpurpose driven marketing\u201d is going to last longer but the purpose of the T ad was to create organic media that they did; you never know the PR agencies would\u2019ve hired Tweets to create backlash for \u2018earned media\u2019. The religious stereotype is an old and lazy work. This ad is a litmus test for all the religious groups to think; we need to teach our generations to respect others religion but not carried away on false equivalence being stoked by stereotypes only then we will be able to learn to address the bigger issues shown by UCB. Thanks for reading, above opinion aren\u2019t intended to hurt anyone opinion, belief. I respect, humanity, science, justice, nation and spirituality respective order. Religion is now a days a controversial component therefore, I keep it for my personal help. Stay Safe and healthy! ",

            "answer_text": "Tanishq adv preaches Ekatvam , the oneness that celebrates the coming together of people from different walks of life, local communities and families during these challenging times and celebrate the beauty of oneness. Why is celebrating Oneness a controversy ? It\u2019s about who celebrates with whom. Few have a disappointment that its love jihad where a hindu women is married to muslim fella. They claim why not its shown other way around. Option 1 : Perhaps now Tanishq should make an adv for diwali where the muslim husband goes to his hindu wife family house to celebrate diwali \u2026 Would that be a solution ?? No its not .. because its not the muslim women that\u2019s married to hindu family . Its still a hindu women married to a muslim guy . The controversy doesn\u2019t settle with logic Option 2 : So the other option would be , Tanishq makes an adv where a muslim girl gets married to a hindu guy and celebrates ganesh chathurthi \u2026 Would that be a solution?? No its not , because the muslim girl has converted religion . The controversy doesn\u2019t settle with logic Option 3 : Tanishq now makes an adv where muslim girl gets married to hindu guy and both become atheists\u2026. Would that be a solution ?? No its not , intercaste marriage removes religious faith in god. The controversy doesn\u2019t settle with logic . So the real controversy is that the adv speaks about communal harmony , feminism and oneness that\u2019s fictional and doesn\u2019t exists in New India Once we had this ,\u2026  And this \u2026.  And this \u2026.  But now we need to check Who owns the biscuit packet - a muslim or hindu ?Who gets biscuit from whom - the hindu offers to muslim or vice versaWho bites the biscuit first - the hindu or the muslimI don\u2019t think any of these were discussed when Krackjack made these adv few decades before. It becomes complicated to shoot an adv without concentrating on controversy now a days - and that\u2019s killing creativity and beauty of a splendid frame. ",
