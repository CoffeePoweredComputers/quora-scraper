            "answer_text": "It definitely is. I\u2019m currently playing it the first time, and have gotten about halfway into the main quest, or a bit farther (I think). While I\u2019m enjoying it immensely, I will be the first to admit that KC:D is not for everyone. I\u2019d expect it to gather a small but dedicated fanbase and remain largely ignored (or regarded as a curiosity only) by the general public. KC:D is a refreshingly atypical RPG in more than one aspect. First of all, it is set in a real world, real historical period and real place, and all of this is carefully recreated with great attention to detail. Many important NPCs (especially the noblemen) are real people who lived in 1403, every town and castle exist (or existed) in real world, and the whole Talmberk, Sassau and Rattay region is perfectly mirrored in the game down to every river and hill. Even some buildings (Uzhitz church for example) are located in the same place in the game and in real life. Secondly, the game is devoid of any fantastical motifs - there are no elves, dwarves, dragons, no spells or magic items. Sure, the alchemy skill gives a possibility of producing some potions, but their effects are more or less of the realistic variety, mostly acting as stimulants or poisons. This gets me to the most important point: all this realism makes the game hard, particularly for players used to standard RPG fare. Combat, skills and levelling are realistic as well. Here is a few examples: your character can\u2019t read and needs to find someone who will teach him; reading is a skill to be unlocked and levelled, and until your characters is good at it, most of the in-game texts will be riddled with spelling errors, rendering them unreadableif you want to do alchemy and brew potions, there is no quick \u201cbrew potion\u201d menu like in Skyrim or Witcher 3 - instead you need to carefully read the recipe (if you can), and then perform all the steps (grinding ingredients with a mortar, boiling them in a cauldron for correct number of hourglass turns etc.); make one mistake and the whole potion failscombat is complicated, and depends on player\u2019s skills as much (or more) as on the character\u2019s skills and stats; furthermore, every weapon has its own fighting style, and you have to learn all this along with your character. I have spent many in-game hours training practice weapons combat with a guard captain before my character was capable enough to enter a tourney or even face a group of bandits on the roadskills are leveled by using them, and there are no generic XPs (this is somewhat similar to the Elder Scrolls series); that means no more \u201cgo kill 1000 boars and become a master locksmith\u201d thing. In this game, killing 1000 boars will make you a master huntsman only.All this means that in order to progress in KC:D, you need to devote a lot of time for it. It is immensely satisfying, but only for certain people. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Highly recommend. It tries to focus on accuracy to the time period, and as such you have to focus on a lot more immersive things such as food intake, rest management, and your health such as not eating spoiled food, but does not make it boring or cumbersome. You aren't the Dohvakiin, able to slay dragons and punk the Empire's soldiers at lvl 1. If you try and fight anything but half starved bandits at lvl 1 you will get your shit pushed in. And leveling up is difficult, as enemies have a tendency to swarm you. But if you persevere, each achievement feels earned, and most importantly, as you level up, damage is increased, but you only damage your opponent if you land a hit, which means you have to get good at using the fighting mechanics to actually win. It's a true test of skill, not of tenacity. ",
