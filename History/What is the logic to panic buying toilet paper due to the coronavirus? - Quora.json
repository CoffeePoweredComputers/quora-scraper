            "answer_text": "Ah! Good O\u2019l Logic! OK. Now the problem here has its genesis in what psychologist Steven Taylor calls \u201cThe Psychology of Pandemics,\u201d I've spent years studying the psychology of pandemics. This is what you need to know about Covid-19 He even wrote a book on the subject if you\u2019re interested. The Psychology of Pandemics The issue at the heart of toilet paper begins with mixed messages. From the story I linked to, above: \"On the one hand, [the response is] understandable, but on the other hand it's excessive,\" Taylor, a professor and clinical psychologist at the University of British Columbia, told CNN. \"We can prepare without panicking.\" The novel coronavirus scares people because it's new, and there's a lot about it that's still unknown. When people hear conflicting messages about the risk it poses and how seriously they should prepare for it, they tend to resort to the extreme, Taylor said. \"When people are told something dangerous is coming, but all you need to do is wash your hands, the action doesn't seem proportionate to the threat,\" he said. \"Special danger needs special precautions.\" So people don\u2019t know, and are left to guess at probabilities. \u201cWhat am I going to need?\u201d Here, Taylor nails what happens next: Panic buying begets panic buying. The VAST majority of people buying toilet paper aren\u2019t buying it because they think they will need it for the upcoming crisis caused by the epidemic. They are buying it because everyone else is, and they are afraid they will not be able to get it if they don\u2019t buy it when they see it available for purchase. Images of empty shelves and shopping carts piled high with supplies have inundated news reports and social feeds. People see images of panic buyers, assume there's a reason to panic and buy up supplies, too, Taylor said \"People, being social creatures, we look to each other for cues for what is safe and what is dangerous,\" he said. \"And when you see someone in the store, panic buying, that can cause a fear contagion effect.\" All those photos of empty shelves may lead people to believe that they must rush out and grab toilet paper while they still can. And what started as perceived scarcity becomes actual scarcity, Taylor said. Social media is a huge player in novel coronavirus fear-mongering, Taylor said. Misinformation spreads with ease, and open platforms amplify voices of panic. Think about it yourself. If I see toilet paper on the shelf right now, I\u2019m GOING to buy it. I have plenty in my linen closet for probably about a month, or at least a few weeks. But the logic persists\u2026If all these other idiots keep buying it, what if I run out? Same thing with hand soap, although, that makes more sense. So, in this case, because of the idiots running around buying up all the toilet paper, I feel like I need to stock up. Come on, admit it\u2026Don\u2019t you? ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s amazing how many people here are answering without knowing the answer. Firstly: People are preparing for an extended quarantine/lockdown type event - they are stocking up on all essential items. The reason does not really matter that much - the symptoms of coronavirus are not highly relevant to this. Some people may be hoarding and overbuying, but there\u2019s also a lot of people who have realised their pants are down all at the same time, and they are not prepared for any eventualities. If all of them buy only moderate amounts, that\u2019s still a lot of extra demand in the short term. Secondly: The thing that makes toilet paper different, at least in Australia where the hysteria is at its highest, is that toilet paper packs are very bulky and can only be held in limited quantities in a supermarket. This means they sell out far faster than other products that people are stockpiling, and can\u2019t be immediately replenished. Thirdly: Add in the typical panic buying mentality. Most people will buy (but not necessarily overbuy) more essentials if they believe they might not be able to get them easily. Once people starting seeing toilet paper shelves empty, assumptions were made, and they got even emptier - it spread across Australia, and it\u2019s now spreading across the world. So there you have it - general stockpiling, combined with limited stocks at supermarkets, created a problem that was at its biggest for toilet paper, and then panic buying magnified the effect. With any luck, every house will be full of toilet paper, rice and Spam soon, and the panic buying will die down before the virus gets a chance to hit huge groups of people. There\u2019s nothing wrong with making sensible preparations, only with being selfish and taking more than you genuinely need. ",
