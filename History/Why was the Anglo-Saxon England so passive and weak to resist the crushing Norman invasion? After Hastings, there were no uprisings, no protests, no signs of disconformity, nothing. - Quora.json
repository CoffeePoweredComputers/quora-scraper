            "answer_text": "May I suggest you start by looking at the Wiki entry for \u201cHarrying of the North\u201d, here is an extract \u201cThe Harrying of the North was a series of campaigns waged by William the Conqueror in the winter of 1069\u201370 to subjugate northern England. The presence of the last Wessex claimant, Edgar Atheling, had encouraged Anglo-Danish rebellions. William paid the Danes to go home, but the remaining rebels refused to meet him in battle, and he decided to starve them out by laying waste to the northern shires, especially the city of York, before installing a Norman aristocracy throughout the region. Contemporary chronicles vividly record the savagery of the campaign, the huge scale of the destruction and the widespread famine caused by looting, burning and slaughtering. Some have labelled the campaigns as genocide. Some present-day scholars have begun to doubt whether William could have assembled enough troops to inflict so much damage and have concluded that the records may have been partly misinterpreted or exaggerated.\u201d \u201cThe King stopped at nothing to hunt his enemies. He cut down many people and destroyed homes and land. Nowhere else had he shown such cruelty. This made a real change. To his shame, William made no effort to control his fury, punishing the innocent with the guilty. He ordered that crops and herds, tools and food be burned to ashes. More than 100,000 people perished of starvation.I have often praised William in this book, but I can say nothing good about this brutal slaughter. God will punish him.\u201d \u201cThe land was ravaged on either side of William's route north from the River Aire. His army destroyed crops and settlements and forced rebels into hiding. In the New Year of 1070 he split his army into smaller units and sent them out to burn, loot, and terrify. Florence of Worcester said that from the Humber to the Tees, William's men burnt whole villages and slaughtered the inhabitants. Food stores and livestock were destroyed so that anyone surviving the initial massacre would succumb to starvation over the winter. The survivors were reduced to cannibalism\u201d There were years of resistance and the North East of England took generations to recover. The Norman Invasion was brutal and resisted with vigour. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t disagree with many of the comments here but I think an important point is that the Norman monarchs were largely administrative rather than legislative. They accepted, for the most part, the system in place. One of William\u2019s first acts was to confirm the Laws of England (albeit with some \u201cadditions\u201d that favoured the Norman hegemony). This is reiterated under Henry I who, after the disasterous reign of Rufus, promises to return to pre-Conquest law but with \u201cthose improvements whereby my father improved it with the counsel fo his barons\u201d. Where there were uprisings, they were brutally suppressed to the extent that the savagery seems almost genocidal. However, in many cases, the replacement of Anglo-Saxon overlords with the Norman ones made less difference to the daily life of a commoner than we like to think. Life was governed by the agricultural cycle, social divisions are largely unchanged. Society was divided into the three estates (those who pray, those who fight and those who work) and the last into the freeholders and the villeins or serfs\u00b6. Lease tenure is a later concept. All through the Norman period, there were uprisings from time to time. Some of that was a response to circumstances (bad harvests, overly harsh dealings by lords, and so on) and some to what we might now call identity politics. Social distinctions were reinforced by language and ethnicity and, consequently, created inertia in social movement. Periodisation is difficult. We could argue that it is not until after the anarchy and the beginning of a new dynasty (the Plantagenets) that the resistance begins to subside. It may be that the child of Maud, who was descended from West-Saxon royalty, became a force of social cohesion especially after the lawlessness of the anarchy. That would suggest a \u201cNorman\u201d period of sixty years or so. But it may be that the greater use of common language across society eradicated social distinctions and more people had a stake in the political establishment. If so, we would have to date that to the end of the 14th century and so the process may have taken 300 years. YMMV \u00b6Serfdom was not eradicated by the Normans, as some claim, but as part of ongoing legal reforms that some date to 1272 (the accession of Edward I) although the process is still continuing as part of the reaction to the vicissitudes of the Black Death and the consequent Peasant\u2019s Revolt, i.e. 100 years later. One of the stated targets of the Peasant\u2019s revolt was the eradication of serfdom. It should be noted that the \u201cpeasants\u201d in the Peasant\u2019s revolt were relatively wealthy freeholders not serfs. Chattel slavery was outlawed by the Normans in William I\u2019s laws and hence the confusion. I think those laws were promulgated a little after 1066. 1080 is the date of the Forest law. ",
