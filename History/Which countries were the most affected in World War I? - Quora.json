            "answer_text": "France - France lost over 4% of their population [1] to the war, with most of the deaths in the demographic of 18-35 year old men.  After the war, the birth rate of France was abysmal (only in four specific years did France register over a +2 natural change in the population, out of 28 years) and did not recover until after WWII [2].  The French economy was in ruins, and was desperately dependent on German reparation payments.Germany - Germany lost nearly 2.5 million of their population [3].  The harsh terms of the Versailles treaty made sure that the German economy was unable to recover, as most of their revenue went to paying off reparations, which resulted in hyperinflation.  Oh, and it eventually led the Nazi party rise to power and start WWII.Russia - Tsar Nicolas II's bungling of both domestic policy (widespread food shortages) and the Eastern Front resulted in massive riots and his abdication, resulting in a power vacuum that Lenin (sent by the Germans) filled, thus starting the Russian Civil War and the eventual formation of the Soviet Union.[1] - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_casualties[2] - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_France#1800_to_20th_century[3] - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_casualties ",

            "answer_text": "Of course we'd have to clarify what you mean by \"countries,\" but to add some top-of-mind thoughts to what's already been written below, Serbia lost about 16% or almost a fifth of its population in the war, through battles, brutal conditions during the occupation period, as well as famine and disease. The retreat of the defeated Serbian Army through southern Serbia, Kosovo and Albania to the Adriatic coast was epic (and is largely unknown in the Anglophone West.) The war also saw the legitimization of \"population exchanges\" - i.e., ethnic cleansing - as Greece forced defeated Bulgaria to accept the expulsion of tens of thousands of Bulgarians from Macedonia and Thrace to ensure these lands conquered in 1913 in the Second Balkan War, and as well Greece (after losing a war in 1919-1922 to nationalists in Turkey), also negotiated the expulsion of half a million Turks from Greek Thrace to compensate for the 1.2 million Greeks who had fled from the Anatolian (Turkish) coast. These expulsions would radicalize and destabilize the Balkans for much of the 20th century.  Poland and Ukraine, neither of which were independent countries during the war, both served as the front line for many Eastern Front battles (provoking an exodus of millions of refugees during the war) and both also contributed more than a million soldiers each to various armies (on both sides), which meant that after the war, both had experienced combat veterans to help establish their independence. (Sadly, Ukraine's independence was short-lived as Lenin and his Bolsheviks managed to re-occupy it.)  John Bennett-Wheeler's famous 1938 study Brest-Litovsk, the Forgotten Peace is seen as seminal, claiming that the treaty was a watershed in German diplomacy during which Germany's leaders (by 1918, a virtual dictatorship by Hindenburg and Ludendorf), had crossed a Rubicon of sorts from fighting the war on defensive principals, claiming that Germany was surrounded by enemies and needed to act to defend itself, to a more imperialistic phase - with success on the Eastern Front, Germany could build an empire in Eastern Europe. However, Bennett-Wheeler concentrates on the Great Power implications and misses the impact of this treaty on many of the peoples living in the Russian Empire at the time - the Baltic peoples, Ukraine, Poland, Georgia, Armenia, etc. - who experienced for the first time in a century or more life outside of Russia. The impact of this treaty would drive nationalist movements in these countries throughout the 20th century. ",
