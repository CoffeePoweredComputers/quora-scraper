            "answer_text": "He didn\u2019t. The catholic cult ADDED books that were never considered Scripture. the 7 books support Roman Catholicism. The remaining 66 contradict Roman Catholicism. They are not, and have never been, in the Jewish canon. Josephus explicitly excluded them from his list. Philo (20 B.C.-50 A.D.) neither mentions or quotes them. They were never quoted or alluded to by Jesus Christ or any of the apostles. The sermapocryphal events. Jewish scholars meeting at the Council of Jabneh did not recognize them. Most Church Fathers in fact rejected them. None of the Apocrypha claim inspiration or divine authority. Many of the Apocryphal books contain historical, geographical, and chronological errors. Many of the Apocryphal books teach heresy, contrary to the Word of God. Their literary style is legendary and fantasy. Some stories are grotesque and demonic. They lack the power and distinctive elements of the Word of God. The sermons in the Book of Acts, which outline Jewish history, do not include apocryphal events. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, St. Jerome was hesitant to include most of the apocryphal books in the canon, due to numerous errors. Even after he did concede to include them (in the fourth century), they were not decreed to be inspired scripture until April 8, 1546 at the Council of Trent. So for 1100 years, they were part of the canon, but not officially scripture. The reason for this is again, because of the numerous errors. It appears they were ultimately accepted at Trent, because without doing so, the Catholic Church had no scripture upon which to base the doctrine of purgatory, invocation and intercession of the saints, the worship of angels, the redemption of souls after death, etc. In fact, if you'll look at the Catholic Encyclopedia, you'll find discussion of \"problems\" or \"errors\" with most of the apocryphal books. Judith falsely states that Nebuchadnezzar reigns over the Assyrians,whereas he ruled Babylon instead.Torbit could not have witnessed the division of Israel into the northern and southern kingdoms in 931BC(Tor1:4),and have been deported 200 years later in 734BC(Tor1:10). Tobit 4:11 and Tobit 12:9 state that giving money forgives sins. This contradicts Christs' work on the cross. Jesus and the apostles quote 260 times from the 35 out of 39 OT books, yet they NEVER quoted the apocrypha. Neither their authors nor the circumstances of their writings are known.The Jews nor the early Christians accepted them as inspired scripture.The books themselves dont claim inspiration.There's no \"Thus saith the Lord\"'s . Although the N.T has 263 direct quotes from and 370 allusions to the O.T, there's not a single reference to the books of the apocrypha. It was at Trent on April 8th 1546, that the pope declared tradition+the apocrypha to be canonical and authoritative. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite simply Martin Luther, a Catholic monk at the time, took exception to the Pope selling indulgences. His complaints had merit, but so went way to far. Why because Catholic Dogma no longer matched \u201chis\u201d theology, never mind that the Catholic theology had been accepted for 1500 plus years. Christ, the Apostles and the Church\u2019s earliest Disciples accepted it. Was the Pope wrong for what he did? Sure he was, but the Church teachings were not, including the 7 Deuterocanonical Books that Luther threw out. Why did he want those Books out of his Bible? the same Book that had always been in the Torah/the Old Testament is because several of them disproved what Luther was espousing. Plus Luther wanted to marry and the Roman Church forbade him fro doing so. The Torah still contains the Books that you are asking about. Plus in the late 1940\u2019s/50\u2019s parts of the Dead Sea Scrolls were found. Guess what some of the 7 Books were in that discovery. In fact in 1611 when the original KJV of the Bible came out, they contained the 7 Books. don't let any Protestant or pastor tell you that the Catholic Church added them to the Bible, it was Luther who took them out. The very first Greek to English Bible, the Vulgate, came out in 383AD. Ask yourself how can one man, Luther, be so much smarter than the Apostles, the Early Church Fathers and early church councils? He couldn\u2019t be. Also the Bible say we are saved by faith alone. Guess what Luther took it on himself to \u201cinsert\u201d the word \u201calone\u201d. I could go on and on but if you are serious about fining the whole truth about Christianity, Goggle Catholic Answers . com and type in why did Luther remove the books from the Bible. As a former Protestant that used to ask this same question, you might learn something that you didn't know. Then if you have doubts, you can vet it yourself. ",
