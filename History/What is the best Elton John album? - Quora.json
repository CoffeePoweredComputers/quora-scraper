            "answer_text": " CAPTAIN FANTASTIC AND THE BROWN DIRT COWBOY. It's the autobiographical tale of Elton (The Captain) and lyricist Bernie Taupin (The Kid/Cowboy): their meeting and their shared struggles up the showbiz ladder, culminating in the recording of their first album, 1969's EMPTY SKY. The brilliant title track - the lyrical poetry of which puts it in my top five EJ songs of all time - marks their humble and humdrum beginnings, uncertain about the path they\u2019ve chosen to take. With \u201cTower Of Babel\u201d and \u201cBitter Fingers,\u201d Bernie and Elton warn of the snakes and demons in the music business, professionally and personally, respectively. \u201cTell Me When The Whistle Blows\u201d is Bernie\u2019s theme, about the big city being too much for him and wanting to get back home to Lincolnshire. (This thread goes back to previous songs like \u201cHonky Cat\u201d and \u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road.\u201d) \u201cWhistle\u201d\u2019s partner, \u201cSomeone Saved My Life Tonight,\u201d is Elton\u2019s theme, literally about the pianist\u2019s suicide attempt in the late 60s.  Despite it being the only single released from the album (#4 in the U.S., #22 U.K.,) I suggest not listening to it on any greatest hits or best-of comps, as the song has more power in the context of its sister songs. \u201c(Gotta Get A) Meal Ticket\u201d finds our heroes jealous about not making it while others have, and it distinguishes itself by the being the only rocker on the album. They find, however, that, though they\u2019re struggling, life isn\u2019t so bad\u2026if you can\u2019t handle a little adversity, you\u2019re \u201cBetter Off Dead!\u201d (In Gilbert and Sullivan fashion!) \u201cWriting\u201d speaks for itself: \u201cWill we still be writing in approaching years?\u201d Well, fifty+ years on, gents! You\u2019ve made your points! This leaves the devastating closers, \u201cWe All Fall In Love Sometimes\u201d and \u201cCurtains.\u201d The former, an acknowledgement of their love and respect for each other, the latter, Bernie officially saying goodbye to the farm life he grew up with, as Elton lum-de-lums us into gorgeous infinity. GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD is usually touted as the best EJ disc, and indeed, it remains his best seller. Others point to the ELTON JOHN album, which housed the classic \u201cYour Song\u201d; some go for TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION or HONKY CHATEAU. Diehards point to later albums such as TOO LOW FOR ZERO (which is my second favourite), THE ONE, MADE IN ENGLAND or SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST. The Captain and the Kid even made a sequel to the album in 2006 called, appropriately, THE CAPTAIN AND THE KID, which, though it couldn't match the heights of its predecessor, was also a five-star affair. Still nothing matches the depth and scope of the original CAPTAIN FANTASTIC. I always say true fans of Elton John point to this disc as his creative apex. Indeed, Bernie, producer Gus Dudgeon, bassist Dee Murray, drummer Nigel Olsson, guitarist Davey Johnstone, percussionist Ray Cooper and Elton are firing on all cylinders here in terms of music, words and execution. This isn\u2019t just my favourite Elton John album, it\u2019s my favourite album PERIOD. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, which is in NO WAY fact because I started listening to him like last December or something like that, here are the top 5 best albums by Elton John and why I believe they are the best. Honorable Mention - Elton John - If nothing else, just because \u201cYour Song\u201d is on there and I really, really, really love that song. 5: Don\u2019t Shoot Me I\u2019m Only the Piano Player - This one is one of his more \u201cpop-ish\u201d albums but I feel like it\u2019s really one of his best. Popular tracks include \u201cDaniel\u201d and \u201cCrocodile Rock\u201d but some of my favorites are \u201cMidnight Creeper\u201d, \u201cElderberry Wine\u201d and \u201cBlues for Baby and Me\u201d. 4: Honky Chateau - This is an interesting album that provokes an emotion that I can\u2019t quite describe. It has some upbeat songs and some slower, sadder songs. The only \u201chit\u201d that I can think of off the top of my head is \u201cRocket Man\u201d, and my favorites from the album are \u201cMona Lisas and Mad Hatters\u201d (my favorite song of all time), \u201cSalvation\u201d and \u201cI Think I\u2019m Going to Kill Myself\u201d. 3: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - This was the first album of his that I bought, which isn\u2019t that big of an accomplishment because I am 17 years old and it was on sale at Barnes and Noble, and I honestly just needed something new to listen to. It\u2019s definitely one of his more \u201cclassic\u201d albums with a lot of hits. Three that I can think of are \u201cBennie and the Jets\u201d, \u201cSaturday Night\u2019s Alright for Fighting\u201d, and, of course, \u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\u201d. My favorites are \u201cSocial Disease\u201d, \u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\u201d, and \u201cGrey Seal\u201d. If you\u2019re just starting out, this is the one to listen to, honestly. I\u2019m glad that I did! 2: Rock of the Westies - It was almost impossible for me to pick between this one and my first choice, that\u2019s how good this album is. It\u2019s kinda short, and some of the songs have strange titles/meanings, but it\u2019s fantastic regardless. I don\u2019t know if there were any hits from this album, to be completely honest. I wasn\u2019t alive during the 70s, when it came out. I do know that there are so many songs that should have been hits, including, but definitely not limited to \u201cHard Luck Story\u201d, \u201cDan Dare (Pilot of the Future)\u201d, \u201cBilly Bones and the White Bird\u201d, and \u201cGrow Some Funk of Your Own\u201d. There are a lot of different sounds that combine on the album, which makes it that much better in my opinion. 1: Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy - I could talk for hours about Captain Fantastic and that\u2019s why I ultimately had to make it my first choice. It\u2019s a biographical album about the early lives of Elton John and his lyricist, Bernie Taupin. There are so many emotions that you feel while listening to the songs. Each one is different, but somehow they all have the same sound, and that ties them together. It makes me so happy to hear anyone say anything positive about this album because it deserves all the love in the world and more. Once again, I don\u2019t know if there were many hits from this album: the only one that I can think of is \u201cSomeone Saved My Life Tonight\u201d, which is beautiful. I have a lot of favorites from this album, which means that it\u2019s basically the entire album because it\u2019s only 10 songs long, but I will narrow it down to five. The order is interchangeable in terms of how much I love them, so I will do it in order of appearance on the album: \u201cCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\u201d, \u201cBitter Fingers\u201d, \u201cBetter off Dead\u201d, \u201cWriting\u201d, and \u201cWe All Fall in Love Sometimes\u201d. I have so much love for this album and how well the songs go together and for the friendship between Elton and Bernie and for Elton John\u2019s voice to begin with! Once again, these are just my opinions which, reading through some of the other answers, I\u2019m noticing aren\u2019t the popular ones. I really just wanted to talk about how much I love these albums. ",
