            "answer_text": " African Americans freed in 1865 could not go back to Africa, with very rare exceptions, because: They were thoroughly Christian Americans and no longer \u201cAfrican people.\u201d They had lost almost all knowledge of their ancestors\u2019 culture, tribes, languages, religions, relatives, customs, environments, skills and ways of life. Almost no Americans were able to tell them the details of African life in 1865. Most of Africa was still a mysterious and uncharted place to rest of the world (see 1865 map above).Few ex-slaves had any desire to go to Africa. There was no prospect of being able to support themselves or survive in Africa, and Africa was not as healthy as it is today. All people have a natural fear of the unknown and prefer the land where they were born, raised and worked.Newly freed slaves could not afford the expensive sea voyage to Africa, nor did many volunteer to pay to send them to Africa. The West Coast of Africa has few ports. The freed slaves would not have known where in Africa to go.For more information concerning the plight of newly freed slaves, please read Prison & Slavery - A Surprising Comparison: John Dewar Gleissner: 9781432753832: Amazon.com: Books.

            "answer_text": "Some did , North Americans to Liberia and some British to Serra Leone but neither nations have been that successful. How ever back in the day there was no popular maps of the African interior and no maps of African cultural (tribal groups or languages) no Google and no reverse sea service back to points of slave auctions or slave raids, so how do you go home? Most slaves born in Africa knew their culture and region but not how to get there from the Americas. Even if they knew all of that they did not have the money or literacy to make the journey. Most slaves by the abolition of slavery were of mixed back ground, Africa is not a country and being black does not make you African. So you could have a grandmother from Ghana, a Grandmother from Angola and Grand father from Equitorial Guinea and a Grand father from Congo, as a freed black slave of African back ground where would you go? you don\u2019t speak any of the languages, you have no Gold, land or cattle and your skills might not be appropriate to that African culture you chose to return to. Going home or sending people back is usually an argument put by racists, in the modern era people say Israeli Jews should go home or be sent back to where they came from and Israel abolished, its crap most Israeli people have a mixed heritage and many came from nations that don\u2019t even exist any more, so how can that be? Going back to Africa is a beautiful pastoral dream but not really achievable at any time since 1878 let alone 1778 or 1968. ",
