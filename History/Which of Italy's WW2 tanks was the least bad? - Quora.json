            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re willing to stay with a rather strict definition of tank, and stay with Italian designs, there isn\u2019t really any competition; the Ansaldo P26/40 is easily the best.  The P26/40 is an Italian medium/heavy tank (heavy according to the Italian military, which classed it as a \u201cCarro Pesante\u201d, but medium to the rest of the world\u2019s standards) which enterred production in 1943. It actually had a pretty long design process; the first circulars requesting the production of an heavy dated dated as far back as late 1938, and requested a 20-tons design that would be armed with a 47/32 47mm main gun and three machine-guns. In July of 1940, following Italy\u2019s entrance in WW2, new requirements were given to engineers from Mussolini himself, requesting an heavier (up to 25 tons) design that would incorporate a 75mm or 90mm gun instead of the 47/32, that was already used in the new M13/40 medium tank. The first design, called P75, was a fairly primitive-looking one, not too different from what an heavy tank of the 30\u2019s would have looked like; its gun was the short-barelled 75/18 mountain howitzer, and in addition to a main turret sporting that weapon aswell as a coaxial machine-gun, a rear-facing turret armed with another machine-gun and a hull-mounted machine-gun were also planned. Judging from the plans, that hull machine-gun was actually planned to be a 13.2mm Breda, while the two others would be 8mm Breda modello 38 machine-guns.  Original, July of 1940 plans for the P75. The rear turret was quickly dropped and the hull redesigned to incorporate a single turret (leading to the hull being lowered) and a larger engine. Around that time, plans started to show a planned 20/35 Breda coaxial autocannon that would never appear on serial-produced models. The 75/18 was also dropped for the longer 75/32, which had an higher (but still pretty low) muzzle velocity of 624 m/s instead of 425. The hull also included two machine-guns. A mockup of that design was built Further down the design process, the two machine-guns were coupled on the right side of the hull, in a configuration similar to the M13/40 and its derivates the M14/41 and M15/42. The turret was also modified, with a smaller commander cupola and overall lower shape.  The two mockups; first one on the left, second on the right. While the first one was known to have the P75 designation, the second one\u2019s is uncertain. The first running prototype was completed in December of 1941. It actually still had the old 75/18 gun, and did not mount a 20mm autocannon, nor a commander cupola. That same prototype would be refitted with a 75/32 gun during the same month.  The first Carro Pesante prototype during mobility trials.  Here compared with an M14/41, 14-tons medium tank.  Refitted with the longer 75/32 gun. At that point, the prototype was quite similar to the final tank. The suspensions it used were leaf spring suspensions, as used on the M13/40 and its derivates; that suspension was a proven model, and while it did not enable the highest speeds, particularly when off-roading. A 420hp petrol engine was planned to be used, but as it was not available by that date (it would never actually be produced), a 330hp V-12 SPA diesel engine was used instead. This gave the tank a power-to-weight ratio of 11.5hp/ton, which, while it may not sound that incredible, was actually higher than a tank like a M14/41 which had about 10hp/ton. That gave the P26/40 a maximum speed of about 40 km/h on a good road. That being said, the 1941 design would still undertake significant changes before reaching the production lines: during the same year, the Regio Esercito (Royal Army) had been engaged alongside its German army against the Soviet Union, and had encountered, and even captured, T-34s tank, which notably had a sloped frontal plate. That feature significantly improved the effective armor of the tank, and Ansaldo\u2019s engineers decided to replicate it on the P26/40, while also thickening the vehicle\u2019s armor (going from 40 to 50mm at the front, with a 45 degrees angling, and 30 to 45mm on the sides). That being said, the sloped frontal plate prevented the use of the dual machine-guns, and the final P26/40 would only feature a single, coaxial machine-gun. The sightly longer 75/34 gun replaced the original 75/32.  A P26/40 with the thickness of various plates, and their angle. The first production-model P26/40 would only be completed around the summer of 1943, following delays both because of development and of \u201ccomplications\u201d (The SPA factory of Turin, notably, was bombed in September of 1942, hampering engine production). By that point, the new Italian tank was barely up to date with most other tanks; when looking purely at numbers, the vehicle was fairly comparable to an early Sherman or a T-34\u201376, both in terms of armor and of firepower; however, the Italian vehicle had a number of flaws that would have decreased its performances agaisnt foreign equivalents: it notably still used riveted armor, instead of welded armor plates, meaning the structural strenght of the vehicle was far inferior to a T-34 or Sherman, and armor plates could resist less than ones of similar thickness but assembled via welding. The vehicle also lacked a commander cupola that reduced the visibility, and thus situationnal awareness of the crew. Last but not least, the vehicle had a four-man crew, with just two men in the turret, meaning the commander had to act as gunner aswell; five-men crew designs like the Sherman or Panzer IV had the advantage of reducing multi-tasking for some crew members, which could bring notable improvements in terms of rate-of-fire or situationnal awareness. That being said, the P26/40 was still vastly superior to the \u201csecond\u201d Italian tank, the M15/42, which was vastly inferior to a Sherman or T-34.  P26/40 tanks awaiting delivery in an Ansaldo factory. The P26/40 barely even served the Regio Esercito anyway, as in September of 1943, while the first examples were leaving the production lines, the Kingdom of Italy signed an armistice with the allies, resulting in Germany invading the country from the North to secure its Southern flank. This led to most Italian military factories, located in the northern half of the country, to be seized by the Reich. They were put back to use, this time to supply German troops fighting the allies on the Italian front. About a hundred P26/40 would finally be produced, with almost all of them being used by the Wehrmacht. A good number weren\u2019t even complete tanks, being lacking an engine, and were simply used as fortifications on the Gustav and Gothic defensive lines.  P26/40, or Panzerkampfwagen P40 737(i), in service with the Polizei-Panzer-Kompanie 10, 1945.  That being said, if you are willing to stretch the definition of \u201ctank\u201d little more to include more combat armored vehicles, I would say a series of Italian vehicles could arguably outclass the P26/40. Those are the Semoventes. Semovente is a term which describes all tank destroyer used by the Regio Esercito, but I will exclude the open-topped 47/32 and 90/53 here, to focus on the closed-casemate vehicles. The development of those was a lot shorther than the P26/40; following the success of the small number of StuG III self-propelled guns in the Campaign of France, members of the Italian military, and notably the designer of the 75/18 howitzer, Colonel Sergio Berlegese, suggested that a similar self-propelled gun based on a medium tank\u2019s hull could be adopted by the Italian military, both elements needed for its construction - a medium tank hull, the M13/40\u2019s, and a suitable gun, the 75/18, being available to Italy. A first prototype was assembled as early as February of 1941, using the M13/40\u2019s hull (and its rather poor 125hp engine), but replacing the turret and double machine-guns with a casemate (42mm thick at the front using two conjointed 21mm-thick plates, 25 on at the sides and rear) in which a 75/18 howitzer was fitted, with 44 rounds stored inside the tank. The vehicle\u2019s crew was reduced to just three instead of four, with a commander that also acted as a gunner, a loader that also acted as a radio operator, and a driver. The prototype was judged satisfying enough to justify an order of 60 serial-produced vehicles.  Semovente da 75/18 in El-Alamein, 1942. The 60 examples were shipped to North Africa in early 1942, while, in Italy, production continued on the hull of the M14/41, which notably featured a more powerful 145hp engine. The Semovente was originally meant as a pure self-propelled gun, meant for artillery support only, but it would quickly end up being used as both a self-propelled gun and a tank destroyer; the Effetto Pronto shell (a type of shells that were quite similar to HESH) could penetrate about 70mm of armor at 500m, which was a lot better than the 47/32 gun used on M13/40 and M14/41, and would soon prove the only reliable way Italian armored vehicles ahd to deal with M3 Lee/Grant and M4 Shermans tank the British started to field in 1942. 60 Semovente 75/18 would be built on M13/40 hulls, 162 on M14/41 hulls, and a fairly low but unknown number on M15/42 hulls.  The command version of the Semovente, replacing the 75mm gun with a 13.2mm machine-gun and additionnal radio equipment. The roof 8mm machine-gun was actually a theorically standard equipment, but wasn\u2019t systematically fitted on the Semoventes in practice. In late 1942, a new type started production, the Semovente da 75/34, which was almost identical to the 75/18 except for the use of a new gun, the longer 75/34 that offered better antitank capacities, and the replacement of the two conjointed 21mm plates with a signle 42mm one. None would be shipped to North Africa before the loss of Tunisia in May of 1943, though, and it appears none were ready for the Sicilian campaign either. About sixty had been finished before the Italian armistice, and the first combat in which those involved was actually the failed defence of Rome by troops loyal to the Kingdom of Italy against invading German forces.  While the had been at least a 75/32 prototype, production models all featured the 75/34 gun. Most of the sixty examples produced before the armistice were seized by the Germans, alongside about 130 Semovente da 75/18. 81 Semovente da 75/34 would be produced under German control following the armistice. Another Semovente model that was introduced just before the armistice was the new Semovente da 105/25 Bassotto, which, unlike the 75/34, included truly significant changes in the series\u2019s design, despite being based on the same M15/42 hull. As its name suggest, it was fitted with the larger 105/25 gun, which significantly improved both the antitank and fire-support capacities of the vehicle (though it was fairly lacking in terms of muzzle velocity, with just 510 m/s) . The hull was lowered and widened, and the casemate was redesigned; its frontal thickness was raised to 75mm, which was fairly respectable for the era. The shell capacity, surprisingly enough, was raised from 44 to 48 despite the larger rounds, and the weight of the Semovente only went from 15 to 15.8 tons, making the 105/25 still able to reach about 35 km/h Just twelve 105/25 were finished before the Italian armistice, and as the 75/34, was used in the failed defence of Rome by the armored division Ariete II. The vehicle was particularly high-regarded by the German occupiers, being comparable to their StuH in combat capacities, while being significantly lower (1.75m against 2.16). Production continued in Italian factories, with about 90 being produced until the end of the war, including a number comprised between 23 and 29 which were fitted with the 75/34 gun, mainly because of the lack of available 105/25.  A captured Semovente da 105/25/StuG M43 mit 105/25 853 (i). The Semovente da 105/25, despite having just a three-men crew and being a little cramped, was still a very decent design, and one that, unlike the P26/40, was fairly comparable to foreign productions of the same era.  One of the examples which was fitted with the 75/34 gun. The last model of Semovente, unlike the previous one, was one that was only manufactured under German control. It was based on the 105/25, but replaced the 105mm gun with the 75/46 (a gun which, unlike the 75/32 and 75/34, was based on an anti-aircraft gun, and not a field gun; it was notably able of a better muzzle velocity of about 750 m/s, and an armor penetration of about 90mm at 500m), which required a new gun mount. The casemate was partially redesigned; while it kept the same thickness of 75mm, it now featured a slight slope that raised the effective thickness of the vehicle\u2019s armor. Only twelve of that 75/46 model were produced in 1944 and 1945, and operated by the Wehrmacht in northern Italy. Several Semoventes of all types, including 75/46, were captured by Italian partisans in May of 1945, when a general insurrection in Northern Italy coupled with an offensive of the allies managed to kick the Germans and their puppet Social Republic of Italy regime out of the peninsula.  A Semovente da 75/46 captured in Milan, May of 1945. The vehicle was most likely captured in the Ansaldo factory which produced them, and was located in Milan.  So that\u2019s my take on the \u201cleast bad\u201d Italian tanks of WW2. While if you only want to count actual tanks, the P26/40 was the best one, I was wishing to include the Semovente aswell, because, unlike the P26/40, they had more combat service, and, in their last versions, were actually fairly modern and efficient vehicles, unlike what most people imagine when they think about armored vehicles that Italy produced during the Second World War.
