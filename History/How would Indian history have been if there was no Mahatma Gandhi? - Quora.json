            "answer_text": "Those who are reading this answer please read it upto end I request you as a Indian and Desh Bhakt. And Do let me know If I am wrong some where and please forgive me If I have said anything wrong by mistakenly. JAI HIND ! JAI BAHART ! JAI HINDUSTAN ! VANDE MATRAM ! BHARAT MATA KI JAI ! Meri aan Tirangaa Hai ! Meri Shaan Tirangaa hai! Meri Jaan Tirangaa hai!  If there was no Gandhi in India then we won\u2019t get the Independence becuase he has also made his huge contribution with other great revolutionaries.Gandhi's purpose was to fight for the freedom of India from Great Britain using non-violence. He also wanted to advance the idea of satyagraha, or passive resistance, to help oppressed people. Gandhi has done good for this country but he has done some bad too. And if there was no Gandhi then Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar and Shivram Rajguru would have seen the India as a Independent Country and Subash Chandra Bose would have made his INA with all of them. With the help of Gandhi our all revolutionaries had sacrifice thier life in World War I and would have shaheed in World War II as well. With the help of Gandhi only we are getting affected with reservation of SC, ST as well. Take a look at Gandhi's major Freedom movements viz Non-Cooperation (NCP) , Civil Disobedience (CD) and Quit India (QI). All these movements gathered masses and momentum before suddenly petering out. The simple tactic which the British followed was to arrest the major leaders and the crowd, due to the lack of direction, eventually petered out. So attributing the independence of India to Gandhi(as well as INC) is a bit unfair as the independence struggle involved so many other people over a period of time. Gandhi took non-violence to a whole new level. He was strongly against violence even if it was for self-defense. His argument that the Jews should have submitted themselves to Hitler instead of resisting him during Holocaust provoked widespread criticism. This is the exact quote: \u201cHitler killed five million Jews. It is the greatest crime of our time. But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher\u2019s knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs.\u201d ~ George Orwell\u2019s \u201cReflections on Gandhi,\u201d Partisan Review, Jan. 1949 Gandhi is the only person who has given the Prime Minister like Jawahar Lal Nehru who has given the power of the country to Lord MountBatten after he has announced the independence to the country.Just because he hadn\u2019t ruled before and he don\u2019t know about that how to rule.And person like Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel become First Deputy Prime Minister of India as he was the first choice of all commrades of congress to elect as prime minister. Last but not the least Pakistan the cruel gift given by him to the beautiful world.Whole world his getting effected by it.Just because of him Indo-Pak war 1965Indo-pak war 1971Kargil war in 1999By Beating them we have proved that one Quote \u201cDon\u2019t tell your father how to make babies\u201d And we all have proved that \u201cBaap Baap Hota Hai Aur Beta Beta Hota Hai\u201d Gandhi is the only person who had helped our brave soldiers to think about the Dream like to get Param Vir Chakra. Complete List of Param Vir Chakra Winners  If there was no Gandhi then this list would be empty I guess only 3 Param Vir Chakra we would have seen in this list that we had got in the war with China. In 198, he was shot and killed by a Nathuram Godse. Nathuram Godse, the killer of Gandhi to read his own confession in the court.However the Indian government had banned the \u200b\u200bconfession of Nathuram.Nathuram\u2019s brother Gopal Godse fought a 60 years legal battle after which the Supreme Court removed the ban. Nathuram had given 150 reasons for killing Gandhi; some of which are as follows: 1. In 1919, people of India wanted General Dyer to be tried for the Massacre of innocent people at Jalianwalla Baugh .Gandhi refused to support this demand.2. Whole of India wanted Gandhi to intervene and save Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev from the Gallows.Gandhi stubbornly refused on the grounds that they were misguided freedom fighters, and theirs was an act of violence.3. On 6th May 1946 on public platform, Gandhi asked Hindus to sacrifice and not fight the members of Muslim league.In Kerala Muslim league members killed over 1500 Hindus and converted 2000 to Islam. Instead of protesting, Gandhi expressed that it was a brave act of Allah\u2019s followers.4. On several occasions Gandhi called Shivaji, Maha Rana pratap and Guru Govind Singh as misguided nationalists.5. Gandhi advised Raja Harisingh of Kashmir to abdicate as Kashmir had Muslim majority, and settle down in Kashi.Raja Harisingh on the other hand he supported the Nizam (Osman Ali Khan) of Hyderabad to join Pakistan , even though the state of Hyderabad (Andhra, Telangana,Karnataka and Berar) had Hindumajority.Nizam Osman Ali KhanSardar Vallabh bhai Patel however over ruled Gandhi. When Nehru heard of Patel\u2019s police action in Hyderabad (operation POLO) he disconnected his telephone with Patel.Nizam surrendering to Patel6. In 1931 the congress committee on designing of Indian flag suggested that the flag be only in saffron. Gandhi insisted changed it to a tri-colour flag.7. During the Tripura congress, Subhash Chandra Bose was elected as president with majority, however Gandhi supported Pattabhai Sitaramayya forcing Bose to resign.8. On 15th June 1947 during congress conclave it was decided to resist the partition of India but Gandhi went to the meeting at the last minute and supported the partition. In fact it was Gandhi who had declared earlier that partition will take place only over my dead body.Patel and Nehru9. Sardar Patel was elected by majority as the first Prime Minister but Gandhi insisted on Nehru .10. Nehru government had decided to reconstruct Somnath Mandir at its cost but Gandhi without even being a member of the ministry forced the Govt. to reject this proposal .At the same time on 13th January 1948 he went on a fast to allow Muslims to repair the mosque in Delhi at govt\u2019s cost.11. When Hindus refugees returned to India after partition, some of them took shelter in some mosques temporarily. When Muslims objected, Gandhi forced all such Hindus children, ladies and the old to leave the mosque and live on the streets.12. In October 1947 Pakistan attacked Kashmir, Gandhi went on a fast and forced the Indian Govt. to pay Pakistan a compensation of Rs.55 crore.Gandhi did not mind hurting Hindu feelings to win over the Indian Muslims.Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were hanged on 15th November 1949 in the Ambala Jail in Punjab.

            "answer_text": "What if there was no Gandhi in India ? Can't say what would have happened if there would have been no Gandhi in India . Persons / personalities who had /have Surname of Gandhi . M. K Gandhi (some people call him Mahatma Gandhi while many criticize him and his role ) . It's upon you what do you think about him . But do you understand why each and every foreign dignitaries pay homage on his grave ? It's not with congress governments . It happened during Vajpayee government and still in the present Modi Government . Why ? Why every government follow him /his policies or thoughts . Next popular surname Indira Gandhi Popular but controversial Popular because India defeated Pakistan and devided into two countries . But she imposed emergency also . It's upon you what do you think about her . Then came Rajeev Gandhi who came into politics as a fresh air ,brought new ideas about computer ,science and technology . His ideas about computer were opposed by every popular leader of that time . Mr. Vajpayee opposed his ideas vehemently and who is called a leader of vision and most popular and genuine leader . I don't understand why people praise Mr. Vajpayee and criticize Rajeev Gandhi ??Today the field of computer and information technology is no. 1 position in giving quality jobs to average Indian engineer . And strange that almost every software engineer is writing against Gandhi . Last Gandhi Rahul Gandhi I can't predict about him . Each and every educted person is insulting him and making joke on him . They believe in each and every fabricated and fake news against him eg Potato (\u0906\u0932\u0942) episode in which his video was cut and edited to tarnish his image later complete video came but people especially highly educted believe in that fabricated video and make fun of him on base of the fabricated video .It's hate of every high cast Hindu that it's congress that is responsible for their wooes and worries because thay have to bow before their inferior people (based upon the theory of caste system ) because of congress . It's upon the thinking of public what they think about the surname of Gandhi .Some see positive points in them while there are many people who hate this name and criticize them for every weakness of India . I think contribution of this surname is supreme . Out of 4 Gandhis 3 lost their lives for India -Mahatma Gandhi ,Indira Gandhi and Rajeev Gandhi . When we search on Google Top 10 , 5 or 3 leaders in the world ,you will find Mahatma Gandhi in every list . What is this ? There are people who perfer Godse still they bow before the grave of Gandhi ? Why this double standred ????? ",
