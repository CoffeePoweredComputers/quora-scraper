            "answer_text": "Slavery was not necessary, nor was it isolated to the United States. The Spanish and Portuguese brought more slaves to the New World than did the English. History inexplicably continues to blame the English for creating a system of \"American\" plantation slavery when the system is documented to have existed before the New World was discovered and more than a century before the English set foot in any colony of their own. Arab and Muslim traders began the African slave trade in the fifteenth century, and the Portuguese adapted slavery to their immensely profitable sugar plantations in the islands of the eastern Atlantic before the discovery of the New World. Three-quarters of all the Africans brought to the New World were imported by either Spain or Portugal. Slavery in England was abolished by a general charter of emancipation in 1381, but the status of villeinage continued in England, slowly decaying, until the last villein died in the early 17th century. However, the initial opposition of the courts of England to the status of slavery began to change with the rising importance of the African slave trade. An extensive traffic in black slaves from Africa began in the 17th century, primarily to supply labor for the sugar and tobacco plantations in British colonies abroad. Initially, the courts held that blacks as a race were chattels, and it was reasoned on these grounds \u2014 really an overdone legal fiction \u2014 that they were infidels rather than slaves, and lacked the rights enjoyed by Christians. In 1700 there was no extensive use of slave labor in England as there was in the colonies. African \u201cservants\u201d were common as status symbols, but their treatment was not comparable to that of plantation slaves in the colonies. Unfortunately, the early history of slavery in North America is poorly documented and inconclusive. It seems certain that none of the founders of the first English colonies anticipated a dependence on black slaves. While the first Negroes brought to the English colonies were formerly thought to have been exclusively slaves, recent research suggests that many of them were actually indentured servants or free craftsmen. It is equally clear, however, that there were distinctions made between black and white laborers and servants in even the earliest English colonies; but in a society where whites were often degraded and treated as brutally as slaves, social distinctions often proved more important than racial ones. The distinction between free blacks, black indentured servants, and black slaves quickly blurred. [i] By the beginning of the eighteenth century, race-based slavery firmly established itself in English North America in place of indentured service. Historians have been hard pressed to explain the sudden shift from white indentured labor to black slavery, as indentured servants were less expensive to maintain and generally more tractable workers. One theory suggests that whites became unwilling to undergo the physical hardships required of work on another man's plantation, opting instead to hack out a living for themselves on the frontier. The absurd theory that the black race was better suited to the hot climate of the South than the white was put to rest by John Quincy Adams: \"Europeans cultivate the land in Greece and in Sicily; why should they not do so in Virginia or the Carolinas? It is not hotter there.\"[ii] In 1729 various slave owners obtained the Yorke\u2013Talbot slavery opinion made by the Crown's principal law officers. Many prominent lawyers felt that it was better to recognize slavery, and to impose regulation on the slave trade rather than to withdraw from it and allow the less enlightened nations to reap the benefits of abolition and the slaves to suffer the consequences. The \"infidel\" argument for maintaining African slaves as chattels was abandoned in the middle of the 18th century, since by then many slaves had been converted to Christianity without gaining de facto freedom. These opinions cited no authorities, and set out no legal rationale for the views expressed in them, but they was widely published and relied upon. Hence a status as a slave evolved from a condition among persons to a condition based on race. The common law, ultimately, would go no further. A decision of 1772 (The Crown v James Somersett) was widely misunderstood as freeing slaves in England, and while not legally accurate, this perception was fueled by the growing abolitionist movement. Slavery did not, like villeinage, die naturally from adverse public opinion, because vested mercantile interests were too valuable. With no sense of irony, slave owners were compensated for their loss at a cost of \u00a320 million paid from public funds in compensation to slave owners. The freed slaves themselves received no compensation for their forced labor. From 1 August 1834, all slaves in the British colonies were \"absolutely and forever manumitted.\" During the eighteenth century slave labor had proved profitable only on large-scale plantations that produced a cash crop. At the time only tobacco and sugar seemed to satisfy this requirement. Growing tobacco had saved the Virginia and Carolina colonies from extinction once the quest for gold and precious metals had been quelled by failure. Tobacco was used as cash, in lieu of cash payments, and as collateral for loans. Tobacco bonds, which encumbered the profits of future crops, were even accepted in lieu of taxes. But intensive tobacco farming was hard on the soil, stripping it of valuable nutrients that could not easily be replaced in an era before synthetic fertilizers. The production of sugar was particularly lucrative, but sugar cultivation was hard on the slaves, who suffered ghastly levels of mortality in the pest-infested humidity of the cane fields. If a large planter of tobacco or sugar were fortunate enough to have three good agricultural years in a row, he could become fabulously wealthy.[iii] Cotton saved the plantation system and breathed new life into slavery in the Antebellum Period. English and New England mill owners purchased the fiber to make cloth. As their mills expanded in number, purchases soared from 720,000 bales in 1830, to 2.85 million bales in 1850, to nearly 5 million in 1860. Ironically, these were the very places where antislavery sentiment was strongest. At the time, it was estimated by abolition proponents that slavery as an institution in America would collapse under its own weight by 1890.

            "answer_text": "Yes \u2014 the transatlantic trade in humans from Africa was totally unnecessary. Even Adam Smith said that it was better to pay people rather than enslave them. Remember \u2014 the poor didn't own slaves because slaves were expensive. One would require capital to buy a slave or something of comparable value to trade for a slave (hereafter referred to as \u201cwealthy\u201d for simplicity). The entire slave supply chain was expensive. From capture of black Africans in Africa, mostly via theft.To the trade or acquisition of an African in Africa.To the set up of a temporary location on the African shore (\u201ccamp\u201d).To the shipment to the Caribbean for repurposing (involving torture, rape, suicide, murder, etc.) via boat.To the \u201crepurposing\u201d in the Caribbean.To shipment to South and North American locations brokers for resale.To the preparation additional preparation and auction off and final shipment to the wealthy.Now, if you read enough of the right books, you see \u2014 here and there \u2014 the slaver class (the \u201cwealthy\u201d) allowing their human property to earn money from their labor (not without the slavers\u2019 share, but, to be fair, sometimes in the absence). There is strong indication, I believe, that slavery was unnecessary because in many respects and incidences, African slaves were lent out to others in the wealthy class and African slaves were receiving pay for their labor, which would technically mean they were under a person's employ or a conditional employee though temporary and highly controlled. If you have the startup capital to pay for a slave or pay a slave even temporarily, there's capital available in the system to pay wages and avoid a slave economic system. Core to the slave economic system (and its offspring, capitalism) is greed. ",
