            "answer_text": " Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto with his family and father Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was born into a politically active family and his father was knighted by British Crown for his services. His father was chief advisor to Governor Sindh during Raj and later on in 1947 he was Dewaan or Prime Minister of Junagadh state. Bhutto\u2019s father secured accession for the state of Junagadh for Pakistan but India was managed to annex the state as it shared no direct border but could have still been with Pakistan due to sea access. Bhutto studied in Berkley University of California and Oxford University and completed his law degrees. Politics was in Bhutto\u2019s blood so it didn\u2019t take him long to find a place in power corridors. He was appointed foreign minister of president Ayub Khan who had close relationship with Bhutto\u2019s father.  He used to call Ayub Khan \u201cdaddy\u201d publicly and he was in fact a groomed to be the next leader in military circles. This explains why he refused to accept Mujeeb ur Raham as sole power holder and asked for two prime minister solution. Bhutto also played key role in 1965 war advising President Ayub Khan to launch \u201cOperation Gibraltar\u201d as India wouldn\u2019t dare to attack international border post Nehru. We all know how that turned out.  Post 1965 War and Tashkent accord, Bhutto fell out with President and launched his own political party in 1967 called Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP). Infamous Elections of 1970 under President Yahya Khan PPP won majority in West Pakistan while Awami League swept East Pakistan. Both Mujeeb and Bhutto couldn\u2019t agree on power sharing while President Yahya Khan despite declaring Sheikh Mujeeb ur Rahman Prime Minister and also announced Joint Assembly session to be held in Dhaka couldn\u2019t transfer the power. Bhutto said to his elected members of PPP \u201cI will break legs of those who will go to Dhaka\u201d despite this few members went there but that was not good enough to transfer power.  President Z.A. Bhutto with Prime Minister Sheikh Mujeeb ur Rahman post split Pakistan was split and Yahya Khan transferred power to Bhutto on a piece of paper quietly and went into dark page of history. Bhutto became the 4th President of Pakistan and also imposed martial law becoming first civil martial law administrator. This was a short history of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and now to his achievements after the failures. Achievement Bhutto manage to free 43,600 POW and 5,000 square mile territory from India under Shimla agreement which earned him respect among military circles.He made the first constitution of Pakistan agreed by all factions called 1973 constitution which declared Pakistan a parliamentary democracy.He tilted Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Policy fully towards China and Saudi Arabia as he hated British and USA to some extent for not doing anything against India and Soviet Union as Pakistan was torn into two despite being an Cold War ally.He organised international Islamic Conference in Lahore with an ambition to form a formidable Islamic block to counter US and Soviet Union influence with a third oil rich power. Yasir Arafat, Mujeeb ur Rahman, Z.A. Bhutto and Colonel Qaddafi in Lahore for international Islamic Conference He started National ID card system with whole of Pakistan registered under family numbers.He wanted Pakistan to be a nuclear power so nuclear deterrence program was started in his tenure.Bhutto nationalised all the health, education and industrial units to align with socialism which causes economic stagnation. Bhutto argued that its just due to massive inequality among classes and economy will pick up soon.He made strong relations with Soviet Union and biggest steele mill of Asia was constructed in Karachi with soviet technology.Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) and Heavy industries were also part of his vision.Land reforms and bringing middle and lower middle class in bureaucracy to form a more balanced civil administration is also credited to him.Bhutto\u2019s legacy still carried by modern Pakistan and he is still debated. His death sentence is called judicial murder but truth is he ordered many killings and threatened his political opponents. Roedad Khan a former statesman who served under Bhutto, further wrote in his book, Pakistan\u2014A dream gone sour, that after 1971, Bhutto started extremely well, bringing the isolated, angered, apprehended, and dismembered nation back into her feet and gave the respectable place in the world, in a shortest period... With a gift of giving the nation a parliamentary system and furthermore the ambitious successful development of atomic nuclear programme in a record time, are his greatest achievements in his life, for Pakistan and her people, but sadly deteriorated at the end\" Bhutto\u2019s former law minister summed up him in one sentence: \u201cA great man but cruel\u201d Fun Fact  Z.A. Bhutto with his newly appointed Army Chief General Zia Ul Haq after bypassing 7 senior Generals to alleviate a 3 star general to the rank of 4 star general in an unprecedented move. Bhutto\u2019s reason was first Punjabi religious COAS who has no political ambitions compared to previous 4 Pashtoon COAS. General Zia Ul Haq made Butto fire a Tank while wearing military jacket stitched by his personal tailor to impress Prime Minister.  PM Nawaz Sharif with newly appointed COAS General Musharraf after bypassing two senior generals reason was first Muajir Army Chief with no political ambitions. General Musharraf showing Glock .19 to PM Nawaz Sharif asking him to hold and fire if you want Sir. Thanks for reading ",
