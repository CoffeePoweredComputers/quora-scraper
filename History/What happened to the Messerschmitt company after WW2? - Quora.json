            "answer_text": "Messerschmitt AG was a German share-ownership limited, aircraft corporation named after its chief designer Willy Messerschmitt from mid-July 1938 onward, and known primarily for its World War II fighter aircraft, in particular the Bf 109  and the Me 262  The company survived in the post-war era, undergoing a number of mergers and changing its name from Messerschmitt to Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm before being bought by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA, now part of Airbus) in 1989. The Messerschmitt KR200;  or Kabinenroller (Cabin Scooter), is a three-wheeled bubble car designed by the aircraft engineer Fritz Fend and produced in the factory of the German aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt from 1955 to 1964. Messerschmitt, temporarily not allowed to manufacture aircraft, had turned its resources to making other products. In 1952, Fend approached Messerschmitt with the idea of manufacturing small motor vehicles. These were based on his Fend Flitzer invalid carriage, the first of Fend's vehicles to enter production at Messerschmitt's Regensburg factory was the KR175.  The title Kabinenroller means \"scooter with cabin\".  FMR Tg500  While the Messerschmitt name and insignia were used on the car, a separate company, incorporated as Regensburger Stahl- und Metallbau GmbH, was created to manufacture and market the vehicle.

            "answer_text": "As you can read in the other answers, they started by building small cars (Kabinenroller) and returned to aircraft building as part of various consortiums from the mid-1950s. In 1969 Messerschmitt became part of MBB (Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm), a company best known for its helicopters such as the Bo 105, a common rescue helicopter.  The company had numerous other branches, for example an experimental maglev system:  Through its subsidiary Waggon- und Maschinenbau Donauw\u00f6rth it was also active in railways. In 1989 MBB was taken over by DASA (then a branch of the Daimler-Benz group), which later became part of EASA and then the Airbus group. A daughter company (MBB Industrieelektronik) was split off along with the rights to the MBB brand. Today\u2019s MBB SE is again a holding company of numerous subsidiaries. ",
