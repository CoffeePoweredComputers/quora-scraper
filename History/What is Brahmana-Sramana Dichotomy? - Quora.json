            "answer_text": "What is Brahmana - Shramana Dichotomy? Carmel, I would like to be very brief and to my best precise too. What we see term Brahmana is in reality not Brahmana as such but a deliberations on the already work done by those who had achieved knowledge of Brahma. They are invisibles and few are chosen visibles. When there remained nothing useful to be known, few had tried tried to fill the gap by innovations on the existing edifice and the masses were cut off due to the costly rituals which only rich and kings could afford. Around 700 BCE the two eminent personalities emeged from the Lichchavi and Shakya and they through the pennance realized the enlightenment and they elaborated in the simple communicable language the essence of the religeon. But the hitherto treated as most confidential had also been kept by those two Shramanas as confidential. Only the artificial cover which had been hanged around in the name of religeon has been removed by them. First is Jin, Mahavira who reached to the level of the Soul and he left rest upon the Soul to decide its further course of action. Second is Shakya Shraman The Buddha who even ventured beyond the soul tracing its further course of action and he found that there is nothing like soul at all. Lichchavi Shramana Mahavir Ji presrved the Atman hence it had received least attacks while Shakya Shraman Gautam Buddha who even saw the uselessness of Atman, had been assaulted by the existing Brahmanas. Between the Shramanas only difference appears to be allwance of the eating of meat. Both had prohibited the violence so as to make Karma for the cycle to start taking away the nirvana, but Buddhists when once allowed as exception by Gautama, carved out the permission to have meat all the time. It so happened that the piece of flesh was dropped from the claws of an eagle fell into the alms bowl of a monk and such alm should be used for consumption or be thrown away was put before Gautama and he ruled that since the monk is no where connected to the cause of violence and also the means to perpetuate the violence because the very food of the eagle being the flesh eating, the monk should eat that. Gautama realized that to make the monks happy the people started pouring meat in the alms bowl, then he ruled that monks should not be the cause of violence in any manner either in the name of alms or otherwise but the tradition of eating meet could not be stopped. In case of Lichchavi Shramana, the eating of meat by any means was prohibited and still no one ever take the meat. Mahatman used for Gautama by the Jains is frowned upon by the Buddhists but this is not appreciated by any one that Teerthankara and Arihanta is no better than Mahatman because Gautama transcended the very Atman. It is at liberty for any one to call once originator of faith and philosophy as Bhagvaan or not but once one realizes the status of Atman has to merge in the greater whole to be called as Bhagvaan. Thus both are Bhagvaan because both had achieved that level from where a vast limitless ocean starts. ",

            "answer_text": "Now, a truly unorthodox answer follows. I dare answering the question from a universal experiential perspective of human spirituality. In the discussion about the \u201eBrahmana-Sramana-Dichotomy \u201c, the issue is understanding the term Sramana. Sramana, in the ancient Vedic time, did not have anything common with asceticism, self-torment, and yoga special physical exercises. Yes, Sramana is a term for toil, hard work, sweat, exertion, strain, however, not having the connotations with the after-Vedic physical, supernatural-body-mind spirituality, resulted in Yoga and Yogic powers, sannyasins practices, tantric practices, etc. What is the issue? The ancient experiential spirituality was not a physical spirituality. It was not a supernatural body-mind game detached from the reality of normal life. It was not an artificial ascetic excess completely detached from the reality of life of individuals and society. The human practical spirituality was in the reality, of the reality and for the reality. The daily reality! Here is the point. To be responsible, to behave responsibly, to act responsibly, to think responsibly, and to do that everything based on the spiritual wisdom, is a heavy task. It is real toil, hard work, sweat, exertion, strain, much heavier than to be ascetic. Actually, we do not realize this fact. What was the main reason of the corruption of the ancient Vedic spirituality in its degradation into the sterile philosophizing and blind beliefs? It was the incapability to be responsible! Does it sound too simply? No. This kind of responsibility demands deep spiritual experiential wisdom. Deep! It does not demand breathing exercises, Yogic postures, visualizations, meditations with ascetic practices. It demands REAL ACTING IN DAILY LIFE for the goodness of society. As we know the history of several thousands of years, the responsibility and hard work for the goodness of society was not the missions of the spiritual or mundane systems. One of the reasons is that the human spirituality was completely detached from the reality of life either as a philosophy or as a religion. Both mundane and religious systems actually lead people from wisdom and spiritual experience to irresponsibility and servility towards the societal life. The reality that, actually, all and any after-Vedic scriptures, or explanations of Vedas, made their steps FROM the Vedas, is probably hardly precepted by Indian people. Sramana made its path from toil, hard work, sweat, exertion, strain to asceticism, self-torment, yoga special physical practices, tantras. By other words, it made its path from the real normal hard work for the goodness of society to extraordinary super-elite \u201cspiritual\u201d work for the \u201cbenefit\u201d of individual detached from the society. Please, understand me properly. This is an issue of all religions. However, not all cultures have the historical experience with the ancient experiential human spirituality embodied in scriptures (Vedas). ",
