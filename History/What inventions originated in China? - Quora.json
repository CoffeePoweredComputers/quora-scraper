            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by \u201coriginating\u201d. What's certainly true is that a lot of things were invented there first. But what's also true is that a lot of chinese inventions stayed there or were treated as mere curiosities. Take gunpowder and guns. Yup, the chinese did both. But the europeans, having seen those primitive beginnings, turned the pipe/powder/ball combination into the deadly force that dominates armed conflicts up to today.Take paper money. Yes, the chinese had it first. But it was European merchants who took it, in the form of bills of exchange and created first continent-, then planet-spanning markets for goods and services using paper and now virtual money.Take the compass. Who? China. But who did one expedition, then was bored and returned home? And who went on, discovered the world and made use of it? Yup.The problem was that some cultures are inherently creative, outward going and open, and others are inward, top-down and stagnant. That basically defines whether the occasional flash of individual brilliance fizzles out or becomes a roaring fire of progress. ",
