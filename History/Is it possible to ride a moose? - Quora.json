            "answer_text": "I suppose it would be possible to train a moose to accept a rider, but you would almost certainly have to start the training while the animal was still a calf. Adult moose are very temperamental and extremely powerful. That combination makes them less handleable than say, a horse or cow, and puts the trainer/rider in a very dangerous situation. People have been killed by moose and people have been severely injured by moose that were thought to be \"tame\" or to have accepted the presence of humans. If you have a lot of time to dedicate to training a mose from the time it is young and you succeed in getting it to accept a rider on its back, make sure you get lots of pictures and please post them here on Quora!

            "answer_text": "Perhaps. It would be difficult because you\u2019d have to take a young calf and train it from the beginning to accept humans, and taking a calf moose from its mother is NOT something I\u2019d want to attempt. Also, moose have unique dietary needs, so raising it and keeping it healthy would be a challenge. This might be of interest: DRAUGHT AND RIDING ANIMALS OTHER THAN HORSES (3); the first pictures are of wapiti, American elk, which are not, of course, moose, but do show that large ungulates can be trained to harness, and everyone knows of the Sami (Lapplanders) and their reindeer, which are the same thing as caribou.
