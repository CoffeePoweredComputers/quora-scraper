            "answer_text": "This depends on what you consider early and I assume you mean the Bow as its counterpart. Short answer the Bow remained superior to the Musket in many ways until the advent of the percussion cap in 1820. After that the bow became less relevant and was obsoleted by the 1860 Henry rifle. From the first crude Chinese guns through to the Mid 1800\u2019s the firearms technology did not change much. The variations were in the lock/striker mechanism but even those were idiosyncrasies more than technological improvements. From the first iterations of guns to the end of the muzzle loading era in the mid 1800\u2019s the practical fire rate of all muzzle loaders was the same 1\u20133 rounds a minute depending on how good you were at reloading. The contemporary of the muzzle loader was the Bow its mission was the same as the gun. Until cartridge firing breach loaders were invented a skilled archer would be at a serious advantage in terms of rate of fire, accuracy, and reliability. A muzzle loader with the early match/flint/wheel locks had about a 50\u201350 chance of actually firing on a sunny Sunday afternoon so you could not count on them. When it was raining your chances of actually getting the gun to fire dropped dramatically and it would be far better to just accept that you are holding a club. Most early guns were designed to be used primarily as war clubs or pseudo lances/pikes that had the potential for actually firing, not guns that could be forced into a melee role. Guns especially in volley fire were incredibly demoralizing to men in combat in a way that arrows just were not. And the type of military engagement typical of the time which was guys standing in a open field taking shots at each other made the gun superior for that specific type of war. A guerilla war (aka a smart war) takes the guns advantage away and it removes the advantage of superior discipline and training, and allows the bow/musket to be more effective and actually stand a chance against the modern military of its day. I am ignoring sequentially fired muzzle loaders with multiple locks and multiple loads in one barrel. They were technological dead ends and just as likely to chain fire or detonate than work properly. They were also incredibly complicated and expensive due to multiple lock mechanisms. In 1779 the Girandoni Air rifle had a 20+1 capacity of a .46 caliber ball at about 550 fps for about 125ft lbs of energy. Compare this to a modern .22lr pocket pistol load in terms of energy delivered the actual terminal effect would be much better than a .22lr because of the nature of round lead balls and their wounding mechanics. Lewis and Clark carried one on their expedition and used them for self defense and hunting. Yes that load could kill deer and elk, and if you had to a bear. That system was impervious to rain since it was an air rifle, it came with a portable \u201cbicycle pump\u201d and a few extra air tanks that could be pre charged and swapped out very quickly. A full charge with that would deliver 30 shots with slightly decreasing effect over time but still fast enough to be lethal. Until the 1860 Henry nothing else on the planet provided that kind of firepower and all weather capability. The Girandoni was amazing despite its relatively anemic load. That air rifle outperformed any other gun in every way except kinetic energy and would be better than a bow in a lot of situations. The first gun designs were match locks, they used a piece of burning hemp rope or other oil impregnated material that would burn slowly and so they have an ember that could be dropped into the priming pan of gunpowder or through a flash hole. They started out just doing this by hand then that evolved into a lever system that more closely relates to a trigger. These were problematic because they were so easy to put out in foul weather or just put out through careless handling. Also since the priming pan/flash hole typically was uncovered it was easy to dump your prime out or get it wet and render it inert. Flint Locks improved upon the design, instead of having a lever that controlled your burning match, you actually had something approaching a modern day trigger with a spring loaded hammer and sear surface. When you pulled the trigger the flint would be let free to fall under spring tension, this flint would strike a cover over the priming pan forcing it open and creating spark. That spark and subsequent flash of the pan would blind you and force you to close your eyes and then there was a delay from 1/10th of a second on a good day to nearly a whole second with lower quality or damp powder before the gun actually went off if it worked at all. Accurate fire is almost impossible with those systems especially under stress. That is why the Volley fire tactic was developed. Wheel locks used a spring loaded wheel not unlike a roller/striker on a lighter. When you pulled the trigger a flat coil spring would unwind like a watch spinning the wheel against a carbon steel striker and create a massive shower of sparks. These worked well but were incredibly cost prohibitive and since they still had the same issue with powder becoming wet the practical difference\u2019s between the wheel and flint locks were pretty much meaningless. The match lock was inferior to the flint lock in every way, the Flint lock was technically inferior to the wheel lock but the wheel lock was incredibly expensive and difficult to produce and did not take care of the single biggest issue with guns that use loose black powder and priming pans. Moisture was the enemy of all muzzle loaders using black powder. When percussion caps came on the scene in 1820 you now had a muzzle loader that would fire in pretty much any conditions as long as the powder you used when loading was not wet. The percussion cap sealed the back end of the gun up and could be carried around in a loaded condition that caused problems with earlier designs. Also the percussion cap greatly reduced the lock time between pulling the trigger and having the round leave the barrel. The percussion cap greatly improved the muzzle loaders reliability especially in the rain. This was a huge iterative step towards a reliable rifle and took a big bite out of the advantage a bow had. The percussion cap was a huge improvement but they were still problematic, mainly you had to put a tiny cap onto a tight fitting nipple in order to fire, under stress thats an issue, also they were a supply chain issue, you could reuse the caps provided you could make mercury fulminate and apply it to spent caps without blowing yourself up. You can find iron bearing flint stone pretty much anywhere, you cannot find percussion caps out on the frontier. The percussion cap also allowed the advent of the repeating handgun, percussion cap revolvers and multi barreled \u201cpepperbox\u201d guns that were the \u201chigh capacity\u201d tools of the day. 5\u20136 shots as fast as you could pull the trigger was huge, the Cavalry used them as primary CQB weapons, the rifles were for horses and men at range, up close the sword and pistol were king. But reloading the pistol took a long time and I would imagine the early single action percussion cap pistols had roughly the same effective rate of fire as a musket when you added the loading time of the revolvers. You could fire 5\u20136 shots as fast as you could work the action which was better than a single shot, but if it takes you 2 minutes to reload the cylinder you are still at about 2\u20133 rounds per minute. Obviously having 5\u20136 shots on tap is better than just one but its not really an improvement on sustained rates of fire. Even with the percussion cap advantage the rate of fire with a musket/pistol was still 3 rounds a minute if you were really really good. 1\u20132 was more likely. At this point a skilled archer would still have the upper hand as long as he could get within range. Closer than 50 yards a bow would be devastating compared to muzzle loaders someone with a bow who is more concerned with suppression than landing shots could rapid fire 20 arrows in a minute and that pressure makes loading a rifle very difficult which makes them essentially defenseless. With the advent of metallic cartridges we see the first real technological breakthrough and an evolution in firearms design since their inception. The percussion cap and the Minie ball both were important iterative steps but they were not really revolutionary in the same way the metallic case was. The percussion cap greatly improved the priming technology and the Minie ball improved ballistics with velocity and accuracy because of its conical shape and dished base that would expand and create a much tighter gas seal. The cartridge was a massive conceptual and technological breakthrough that took advantage of percussion cap priming technology and the enhanced ballistics of the Minie ball and crammed it into one self contained cartridge. In 1860 the Henry Rifle was released with a 13 round capacity of a big pistol cartridge that we still consider effective today, it is comparable to a modern .40 S&W. The loading system and its exposed follower were the Henry\u2019s main problems. The 1866 Winchester improved upon the design with an improved loading system which fixed the issues with the Henry and it was the first real repeating rifle made in massive numbers and its famous for winning the West because it was so far superior to anything else out there. The lever action specifically the 1866 Winchester should be considered the first \u201cassault rifle\u201d because it had the same practical effect and an even greater technological disparity between its contemporaries in battle as the STG-44 compared to bolt actions, the STG 44 was coined the first \u201cassualt rifle\u201d or \u201cstorm rifle\u201d by Hitler. Its interesting to note that you would be better served in a fight with a lever gun than any bolt action rifle from WW2. An 1866 Winchester is closer in terms of actual effect on the battlefield to the self loaders used in WW2 than to bolt actions that were universally adopted decades after the lever actions were introduced. A guy with an M1 Garand would not really have much on someone with an 1866 Winchester. Reloading is where the Garand would really win out. A guy with a Garand or an 1866 Winchester have a staggering advantage over someone with any WW2 bolt action rifle A guy with a Lever action in the 1800\u2019s had such a firepower and speed advantage over everything else that it was not only competitive with its military counterparts it remained superior to them until self loading rifles became the standard everyone used. Lever actions would have served incredibly well in place of the standard bolt action military rifle of WW1 and WW2. The rate of fire with a lever action is comparable to a self loader if you are reasonably practiced. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you\u2019re talking about medieval and Renaissance firearms in Europe. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re \u2026 both right and wrong that firearms were adopted slowly. Firearms existed contemporaneously with weapons such as trebuchets, longbows, and crossbows for centuries, sure. In that sense, you could argue that they were adopted \u201cslowly.\u201d At the same time, it\u2019s also true that firearms were rolled out into military and civilian life about as fast as the technology made it practical to do so, and people reorganized virtually all of warfare around firearms. In that sense, they were adopted as fast as humanly possible. You\u2019re certainly right that firearms had distinct limitations during these centuries. You\u2019re also right that they weren\u2019t without their critics - and I\u2019m talking about people arguing that the things were just too slow-firing or unreliable to be worth much. But on balance, people\u2019s reaction to firearms was more like, \u201cHoly shit, these things have so much potential.\u201d And they were willing to go to pretty drastic lengths to unlock that potential. Like, let\u2019s-reorganize-the-entire-army lengths. Or even more fundamentally, let\u2019s-redefine-the-very-concept-of-army. The French victory in the Hundred Years\u2019 War was largely a result of the fact that they reorganized their entire army to deploy artillery more efficiently than the English (or prior French) army. The death of the army-as-a-collection-of-feudal-warbands concept was due in significant part to the fact that that model didn\u2019t put enough guns in the field. Naval warfare underwent a similar tectonic shift, all centered around the goal of getting as many guns as possible pointed at the enemy. And pretty much any time a less industrialized people came into contact with firearms, they adopted them as fast as they could. One of the major reasons for this is that firearms really did tend to pack more of a punch than their nearest alternative weapon systems. Now, we shouldn\u2019t overstate that. For instance, it took about four hundred years for firearms to decisively win the battle against body armor; let\u2019s not have any nonsense about this  making this  obsolete overnight. At the same time, for pretty much any given year in the Middle Ages or Renaissance, the guns available at that time gave you a better chance of penetrating body armor with ranged weapons than any kind of contemporary archery. Even with the reliability and rate-of-fire issues. That\u2019s the sort of potential that made people sit up and take notice. It\u2019s also worth remembering that archery required quite a bit of finagling to make it really effective. For instance, as the English learned, if you really wanted to make longbows effective against armored attackers, you had to be able to pour it on at point-blank range for an extended period of time. That\u2019s not an easy circumstance to manufacture. At Agincourt it took muddy weather, terrain that channeled the attackers into a slot, and defensive stakes to achieve. Crossbows had significant rate-of-fire issues - so significant that it was standard doctrine for crossbowmen to fight only from behind fortifications, and essentially to carry portable breastworks with them in field battles.  So yeah, early shoulder arms were only effective when employed from natural or man-made fortifications, like the famous Hussite war wagons.  But in context, that\u2019s actually not that different from what it took to achieve effective longbow or crossbow shooting. Pistols have a similar story to tell. Where the pistol really came into its own was as a cavalry-on-cavalry weapon (as a cavalry-on-infantry weapon, it was significantly less successful for all the usual reasons).  Now, again, it\u2019s not as if pistol shot could just blast through plate armor like tissue paper. Not at all. But nothing blasted through plate armor like tissue paper, and certainly nothing that could be employed from horseback in a cavalry melee. And taking down a mounted opponent from horseback was always a difficult proposition, one that more or less required both combatants to agree to fight it out.  The pistol, for all its various flaws (reliability, inaccuracy, short range, single shot, no guarantee of penetration, etc.), changed that game pretty radically. With a pistol, you could ride right up to hand-to-hand range with your opponent, discharge your pistol at point blank (some manuals of the time advocate literally pressing the muzzle of your pistol into a weak spot in your opponent\u2019s armor, almost like a gunpowder-powered knife), and then ride away. Hit or miss, kill or not, a pistol meant you didn\u2019t have to agree to fight. That\u2019s huge - so huge that people changed the whole way they did cavalry combat just to take advantage of its hugeness. As for artillery \u2026 once the French figured out that batteries of small guns firing in coordination were actually far more effective than single ginormous guns  gunpowder artillery quickly became the dominating factor in siege warfare. They were the doomsday weapon that made earlier fortifications obsolete, and the weapon that designers of new fortifications spent all their time trying to figure out how to mitigate.  There was, of course, a back-and-forth in all of this. As guns got better, their potential could be utilized in less and less specialized situations. Firearm-equipped infantry could be brought out from behind the fortifications, say, and merely protected by friendly troops. As gunpowder improved, guns achieved greater penetration and range. Cannon eventually became so small that they could be deployed as field artillery, in an antipersonnel role. And likewise, defenses improved: new designs for fortifications, better body armor. The back-and-forth lasted for centuries, as I said - in fact, it outlasted both the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. So \u2026 yes, early firearms had significant limitations. But people were quick to see their immense potential, and they pretty much moved heaven and earth to maximize that potential and minimize the practical impact of the limitations. In that sense, they were rapidly adopted. At the same time, even with all that drive for innovation and adoption, you\u2019re right that gunpowder didn\u2019t become the dominant force on all aspects of the battlefield for centuries. In that sense, they were adopted slowly. ",
