            "answer_text": "Cowboys were much more teenagers and young men than the typically older ones shown in films, the John Wayne film \u201cThe Cowboys\u201d and the diverse, hard-scrabble crew in \u201cLonesome Dove\u201d are unusually accurate portrayals. It\u2019s some of the worst work in the West for pay, hours, danger, seasonal rather than year-round employment, living conditions, physical wear and tear on the cowboy\u2019s body and few personally-owned assets like his saddle, and put one near the bottom in social status so finding a wife was especially difficult or impossible. Perhaps a third of cowboys were former slaves, blacks and blends, with easily a fifth or more were Mexicans in pre-1836 or post-1836 heritage and more often the most experienced and skilled cowboys of all rather than the simple townsmen or farmer/peasants they\u2019re more often portrayed as (usually in comic relief and quite minor roles.) The Irish immigrants were often cowboys (along with every other dangerous and hard-to-fill job in America) coming from a cattle culture in Ireland and a quite discriminated against minority status as well, that\u2019s more often shown in the films but not as desperately poor, short and skinny from childhood malnutrition, unarmed, and sunburned as they really were. Cowboys aren\u2019t the same as gunmen although the films make them interchangeable just as most people who own a deer hunting rifle today aren\u2019t equivalent to trained combat infantrymen or military snipers, but in a western everyone has something of a fast draw and can point-shoot from the hip which takes more expensive ammunition than most had, let alone hundreds of hours of practice to be good at it. Cowboys are also a much smaller segment of the western communities\u2019 population and seen in town in small groups on payday or sent in for supplies with most of the crew (more often a handful or fewer than the 10\u201350 hired hands common in too many westerns) taking care of the livestock, cattle and horses plus often pigs and chickens, fences, etc.. The big crews of cowboys with nothing to do now were the cattle trailherders who\u2019d just sold the entire herd that did make the railroad towns with stockyards (Abilene, Hays, Dodge, Sedalia, etc. quite wild for a few years.)

            "answer_text": "What do Western Movies get wrong about cowboy behavior? The thoughtfulness of cowboys.. Cowboys in films are often portrayed as poet/philosophers in the saddle. But in reality, illiteracy in the US in 1880 was around 60%. Most \u201ccowboys\u201d in real life cowboy times have never read a book, could not read the local newspaper and could not write their name. Because this was a time before radio and print media was the predominant form of mass communication, they were likely politically, socially, scientifically and culturally ignorant. Hardly the wise mustachioed man on a horse. ",
