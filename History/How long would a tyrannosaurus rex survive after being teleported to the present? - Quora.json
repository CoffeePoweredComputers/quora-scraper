            "answer_text": "They lived right where I live now, a skull was found just 3 miles from here, but it was a vast inland saltwater sea and marshes then (the Northern Plains). So it would depend where you time traveled AND teleported the T Rex to. It\u2019d need to have firm enough footing for his weight yet enough plant foliage to keep lots of tasty herbivores around him. So a cattle, sheep, or bison ranch would be the most straightforward in the American West, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii, Florida, or Indonesia. The 1969 film about this, \u201cValley of the Gwangi\u201d has a lot of useful tips on how to do this other than the oddness of a thousand pound horse and 400 lb. test lariat rope somehow managing a many ton T-Rex\u2026oh that\u2019s right it was several horses, yeah that\u2019d work\u2026. Living on livestock, I\u2019d assume several cattle per day, would get very costly (sheep are pretty cheap though\u2026) and not even a bison ranch builds fencing that would deter a T-Rex. Maybe review \u201cKing Kong\u201d films for fence ideas since Kong deals with T-Rex\u2019s on Skull Island too so clearly there\u2019s been a learning curve by the natives on that topic. Texas ranches plagued by 3 million wild hogs would be a good fit too as dryland ranches are routinely tens of thousands of contiguous acres while the hogs might be too small and quick for the T Rex\u2019s arms and neck muscles to succeed with. Africa would have the widest wildlife buffet, hippos and Cape Buffalo would be particularly satisfying. On the other hand a rhino, especially a rhino herd, would probably be a fatal encounter for the T Rex, getting disemboweled by that huge horn. On many college campuses savvy faculty could keep it there, dining on students wandering across the quad oblivious to anything but their smart phone screens and easy to list as \u201cdropped out, reason unknown\u201d while campus\u2019s avoidance of \u201cnegative information\u201d would probably let it continue for years. If you were doing a dark comedy, this would fit well along the lines of \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors\u201d. ",
