            "answer_text": "For several reasons: \u2022 The disagreement of the European powers and the influence of the royal elite.The acting of the European elite. of the newly created modern European culture but each of them has its own national interest in influencing the other party. \u2022 Eternal Russian interest in access to the Adriatic and Aegean Seas, but as stated above, acting as cultural and modern European, the ultimate goal is hidden. \u2022 The influence of Austria-Hungary in the Balkans and secret plan of the collapse of the Hapsburg dynasty which includes France, Britain and Russia in that master piece. \u2022 The desires of the newly created Balkan states, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece to expand their territories. \u2022 A Balkan fool who will do something to be the reason for the already modern European culture to remove the mask from his face and show his rigidity, aggression and imposing influence. Why were the Balkans so important to the start of WWI? \u2022 The Balkans is a territory that is an economic crossroads (with sufficient natural resources, a sea ideal for military bases) and also a center of influence for Russia, Britain, France and Germany, and each of these has its own members who act for each of them. There are also peoples who in the 19th century were divided by the imposed new national consciousness, religiously divided (a process that began in the 17th century) with imposed linguistic difference, as well as the rest of the world, without primary schools, as the only education source was what the priest who would tell them to what national modern group they belong to. While all this sounds ridiculous and unrealistic, all sources for European royal internal division should be checked, including Russia. Who is behind Gavrilo Princip? A small country called Serbia? versus the Astro Hungarian Empire? To whom can the disintegration of Europe bring the greatest benefit? ",

            "answer_text": "It was a zone where interests collided. Russia wanted acces to the sea that would not be blocked by Ottomans. Austria wanted to spread its borders on account of declining Ottoman empire. Ottomans wanted to keep as much of the area as possible. The ethnic groups living here wanted to be self governed. Britain, France and Germany wanted to have influence over the area through influencing the newly founded states and also prevent Russian expansion. Italy wanted to control as much of the east Adriatic coast as possible. So - an area where borders were to be redefined, established state of affairs was disapearing and all major players had their interests. Ever since the Crimerian wars (when France and Britain helped Turkey against Russia) it was just a matter of when all hell would break loose. ",
