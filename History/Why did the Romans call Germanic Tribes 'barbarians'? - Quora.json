            "answer_text": "To cite a 16th century Frenchman named Montaigne (He is talking about Native Americans but what he says generally applies to many more cases) I find that there is nothing barbarous and savage in this nation, by anything that I can gather, excepting, that every one gives the title of barbarism to everything that is not in use in his own country. As, indeed, we have no other level of truth and reason than the example and idea of the opinions and customs of the place wherein we live: there is always the perfect religion, there the perfect government, there the most exact and accomplished usage of all things.  As for the Germanic tribes, you can read Germania by Tacitus to get an idea of how they lived during the first century AD. Unlike the Romans they lived in wooden houses, they did not spent a great deal of time on agriculture and economic pursuits. In terms of equipment you are mostly looking at shields and spears, swords were rarer and armor even more so. Though it should be noted that several German auxiliary units of the Roman Empire had roman equipment.   There were two major defeats the Germanic tribes inflicted on the Romans during the first century. One was the Revolt of the Batavi - Wikipedia, these were Germanic people forming part of the Roman army, as such I believe most of them would have been decked out in Roman armor. The other battles was the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest - Wikipedia, here too units of Germanic cavalry in Roman service helped the more traditional equipped Germans but they mostly got an advantage by ambushing the Romans. In most aspects the Romans were well ahead of the Germanic tribes of the first century AD. By the fifth century however there was very little if any difference between the soldiers of the Germanic tribes and those of the Roman empire. A late Roman general remarked that even in siege craft these barbarians of old now matched the Romans. But to get back to your original question: Yes to the Romans of the first century AD the German tribes would appear to be a bunch of backward savages who walked around half naked most of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "The term barbarian which comes from the Greek word \u0392\u0391\u03a1\u0392\u0391\u03a1\u039f\u03a3 - varvaros initially meant any non-Greek. Sometime in histroy there was a big gap between Greeks and others however. Greeks had more advanced civilization. Greeks weren\u2019t concerned only for survival and violence, they would pursue other things than warfare such as poetry, arts, science. On the contrary, most of the world around that time was far more oriented towards warfare, didn\u2019t have any good architecture and science was not even existant. So the barbarians, non-Greeks, were less sophisticated, uncivilized and violent. Thus the term barbarian became a synonym to \u201clower\u201d people who would only be concerned with war and were savages. Germanic tribes during that time were focused on war. It was their habit. I don\u2019t mean war as in politics, I mean their life was militaristic, as pretty much most of the world. They were barbarians. It doesn\u2019t mean that if you met a German of that time wouldn\u2019t talk to you and was evil, but they were kinda people of war and aggressive. ",
