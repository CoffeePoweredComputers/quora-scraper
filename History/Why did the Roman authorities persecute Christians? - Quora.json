            "answer_text": "The Romans were polytheistic. They believed in all sorts of gods. They picked up gods by the bucketful as they conquered new areas and were quite content. Then they ran into the Jews, who didn\u2019t believe in multiple gods. In the Roman mind this was atheism. The relationship between the Jews and the Romans gradually soured and there were wars and rebellions. Although troubling to the Romans, it wasn\u2019t too outlandish as there were lots of groups that gave them grief and they were an insular group and not that numerous. Then Jesus and his apostles came along and changed all that. Suddenly you had a Jewish sect that was growing like wildfire and spreading their atheistic nonsense and worse had this idea that slaves and freemen were equal before heir token God. This led to several areas of contention. They refused to acknowledge the Emperor as a god even to the point of death. This really messed with the Roman mind. In many accounts you literally had Roman officials begging the Christians (and Jews) to give up their atheism for even a token display and they chose death instead. That kind of devotion to duty was both impressive and baffling to them. Many Romans were very impressed and the Christian Way began gaining influence. Christians hated corruption and lawlessness as much as the heroes of the Roman Republic. They also had a tendency to boldly call out corruption in public officials. This resulted in them getting some ruthless enemies. Certain elites began a political smear campaign to blame all disasters on those atheistic Christians. The worst of these was probably Nero. He blamed and punished them for ridiculous things to the point that it became an ancient meme. Yet the Christian Way refused to disappear. For over 200 years the Roman view of Christians wavered between admiration and loathing. Then Constantine declared Christianity to be AN official religion of the empire and worked to get them to organize themselves, which calmed things down. In conclusion: This is a quick summary of the answer. The descriptions of this period cover many volumes and there are many many theories about it. This is my conclusion from my studies and others WILL disagree. Honest comments and disagreement is welcome. Trolling and rudeness is not. ",

            "answer_text": "For the most part, the Romans didn\u2019t CARE WHAT YOU BELIEVED UNLESS THEIR POCKETBOOKS WERE IMPACTED. It is what got St. Paul in trouble in the Acts of the Apostles. The silversmiths of Ephesus made their money selling statues of Artemis. No one will want out statues! Get rid of him! The owner of the slave women who prophesied was her owner\u2019s biggest money maker. Paul got charged with destruction of property. Sacrifice to the pagan gods was seen as patriotic and your civil duty, like paying your taxes. The meat went to the poor. Christianity started out as a version of Judaism. When the Romans tried to put a statue of the Emperor in the Temple, the Jews protested. The Romans said they would kill anyone who objected. The Jews dropped to their knees by the thousands, bared their necks and said go ahead, we would rather die than allow the Temple to be defiled. The Romans were shocked and impressed. Everyone other group welcomed the extra statue. They thought the Jews were nuts. Gods are something you bribe to line your pockets, not something you die for. The Romans valued harmony. Judaism was granted official Romans status. The Christians deliberately split from the \u201cMake Israel Great Again\u201d Jews when the Romans got sick of the Jewish uprisings and leveled the Temple. They needed to convince the Romans they also weren\u2019t planning to overthrow the government. Estimates put the Jews at 10% of the population of the Roman Empire and a good percentage were mercenaries in the Roman Army. Judaism was a popular fad among the Roman women. It was ANCIENT like the Egyptian gods and had a WRITTEN CODE. Both VERY impressive. The men wanted NOTHING to do with the required circumcision thing and didn\u2019t like the dietary requirements. (i.e You want me to do WHAT?! - No way Jose!) Christianity started as a women\u2019s movement. It was one of the insults in Roman society. It was considered a religion for women and other slaves. More men joined it as it didn\u2019t require the circumcision or dietary restrictions of Judaism. It got another big boost when the Christians stayed and nursed the plague victims. They survived and joined in gratitude. Then Constantine had his vision of winning control of the Empire with the help of the Christians. He became as much of a Christian as he understood and LOTS joined to impress the Emperor and line their pockets. Also Constantine WON with the help of this God. VERY Impressive. ",
