            "answer_text": "Anubis was the son of Nephthys, goddess of service, and either Seth, god of the desert; Osiris, god of the dead; or Ra; the sun god. The ancient Egyptians called him Inpu. His female counterpart was Anput, goddess of funerals, and was possibly the father of Ammut, the goddess of retribution, and Kebechet, goddess of embalming liquids. He was the god of mummification, orphans, dogs, the helpless, the poor, lost souls, funeral rites, death, embalming, protection, war, graveyards, tombs, and the afterlife. Anubis was depicted as man with a jackal\u2019s face and holding a flail. He was sometimes shown fully as a jackal (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Anubis_jackal.svg). Bastet was the goddess of cats, dance, music, joy, the sun, beauty, the home, the hearth, love, childbirth, protection, pregnancy, fertility, domestic life, sex, kindness, women, warfare, and secrets. She was the child of Ra and the mother goddess Isis, and was called Bast by the Greeks. She was the kind counterpart of Sekhmet, the warrior goddess; and was depicted as a lioness, a woman with a cat\u2019s head, or a black cat. With Ptah, the creator god, she was the mother of Maahes, god of protection and warfare. If Anubis was the son of Ra, then he and Bastet would be half-siblings. But their mothers were sisters, so they were first cousins. ",

            "answer_text": "Bastet and Anubis were ancient Egyptian gods. The Egyptians said Anubis was part of the constellation Canis Major, the Great Dog, in the sky. Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is part of Canis Major, and is called the \u2018dog star\u2019. In Egyptian myth, Anubis presided over the mummification and preservation of the body of the god Osiris, and so certain Egyptian priests dressed as Anubis and used an Anubis mask when presiding over mummification and burial of the dead.
