            "answer_text": "That it is a profession not a culture. Only a few of what are called \u201cvikings\u201d ever went viking. Vikings raided each other as much as they raided non-Scandinavians. Vikings were not unique. Piracy was endemic. Vikings just were better at it and told better stories when they got home. The Sagas were not compiled by Vikings. Not exactly. What we have comes from the 1200\u2019s when Iceland was a benign theocracy under a series of Bishops who ruled like Jarls and among their \u201cbloody deeds\u201d patronized artwork including the collection of Skaldic literature and carvings in Walrus Ivory (the book Ivory Vikings speculates that the Lewis Chessmen were made by the great Icelandic craftswoman Margaret the Adroit). They were probably written by skalds or rather copied and recopied (copyright was sketchy in those days), but the finishing touch of gathering them came long after when no one went Viking anymore (though many went trading and some fought for foreign rulers). At that some works are lost to us. The culture of Early Medieval Scandinavians is far more interesting than the fact that some of them went raiding. In fact it is a fascinating culture with great artwork and literature, as well as a talent for law. It is fashionable to say \u201cthey were done wrong; they were more than bloodthirsty barbarians.\u201d In fact they would have loved to be remembered as bloodthirsty barbarians and that sort of thing is what they focused on in their stories as well as the imaginative nicknames they gave every tool of war. But the fact is they WERE far more, and they were many things about them that were more interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "They generally undervalue their hybrid vigour as Proto-Germanics mixed with native Scandinavians some Baltic-Slavic, and others in their mix. Viking was more of a time period and approach to trading and also raiding. What came before needs to be understood and that is, R-L48 people taking over Scandinavia around 1,700 BCE, likely by invitation and a blending into coastal North Sea Germanic-Scandinavians. Also, the building up of power over time and of the eventual ship building, runes, metalsmithing, agriculture, trade, exploration, vast trade networks long before 789 CE when the Viking Age began with a raid on Dorset, South West England.
