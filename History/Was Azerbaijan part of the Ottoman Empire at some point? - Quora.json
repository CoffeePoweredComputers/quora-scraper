The most significant effect of this was that the constriction of Safavid territories forced them to set their capital in Isfahan to the south, and to carry out an extensive series of reforms under Abbas Shah the Great (r. 1588\u20131629) which had the effect of both providing Iran with a large, modern army complete with artillery and regular troops and divorcing the dynasty from its traditional tribal, Turkish constituents (which would be followed with a major turn to Armenians, Circassians and others as the major support of the state). This guaranteed the Ottoman conquest was soon followed by a much greater Iranian counterattack in the war of 1603\u201318, restoring the borders that mostly still hold to this day. ",

Since there were not nationalism on those eras, Azerbaijani origin shahs never gave up on their homeland and stroke back when Ottoman army returned to capital. So Ottoman only managed to took Azerbaijan temporary but failed to turn into part of it. ",
