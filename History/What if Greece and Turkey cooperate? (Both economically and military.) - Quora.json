            "answer_text": "This is not a new idea. It is called Hellenoturkism and it has been studied and promoted by several scholars mainly from Dimitri Kitsikis, a Greek professor living in Ottawa, Canada. But also people like Mikis Theodorakis have been attracted to the idea at a certain period of their life. Behind the concept lies the revival of the Byzantine Empire. The idea is not good: as I have written in other opprtunities the mentality difference between the two nations is vast. This becomes even deeper now with the islamic agenda of Erdogan. Furhermore the Greeks believe they are superior as a civilization and they would eventually absorbe the Turks but this is not going happen as it has not happened since the Turks arrived in the area 1.000 years ago. Should such project was about to materialize it would face terrible enemies: first the Russians who would be blocked from the Eastern Meditteranean. Second the Israelis, consequently the US. Third the Egyptians. But seriously, how to consider something that would be opposed by the super powers of the Globe? The only feasible implementation of such cooperation would be the incorporation of Turkey in EU which, notably, was promoted by Greece. However this clever Greek policy exposed the leading powers of EU which, up to then, were hidding behind the Greek-Turkish differences, but in reality had never the intention to invite Tukey in. ",

            "answer_text": "To COoperate both sides must seek for it. Both countries must apply the same rules. Greece applies the rules that the whole world accepts, turkey wants everybody to follow their rules that gives them all the powers. So it cant be done. Turkey has a casus beli against greece for 25 years now although we are both members of NATO. Although turkey says they want discussion and cooperation, they send military ships to places they acknowledge we both claim. What a kind of cooperation can fit there? ",
