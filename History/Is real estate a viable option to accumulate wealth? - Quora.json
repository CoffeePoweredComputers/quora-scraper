            "answer_text": "You become rich investing in Real Estate through two magical economic principals, Compound interest and Appreciation. Compound Interest: My first introduction to this principal was in my 7th grade math class, when my teacher wrote $10,000 on the board and asked us how we can turn this into $100,000 or even $1,000,000?! As a 12- year old whose only source of income was a crisp fiver every Saturday my neighbors lawn needed mowing, coming up with $90,000 seemed like a stretch. What i failed to see then was that time was the missing X in the equation that allowed $10,000 to turn into $100,000. The lesson was based around how a 6% increase in your money year after year can double your money in about as much time we all had been alive. He then gave us hypothetical situations like, what if you added $500 every month or something along those lines to show us how time is the true value of money.(For all my econ majors out there hope you liked that joke). This one lesson founded my first beliefs on saving/investing and would later become the very foundation for my career. So how does this principal of wealth growth apply back to real estate? The answer is one you've heard before, \u201cThe sooner you start the better its going to be, the longer you wait the bigger the headache.\u201d Do not take that last bit of advice and go invest your last dollar in a fix and flip project. In today's day and age there are many ways to begin investing in real estate for as low as $500! From REIT\u2019s to Syndication's to PE Firms, there are a ton of avenues that allow you to begin investing in Real Estate without you having to go out and purchase a property. Getting into the game early and often is how you will use time to your advantage. For those of you who are like myself and are fresh out of college, early twenties, make the early sacrifice to start a portfolio now and not down the road when your take home is better. I know at that phase in life starting an investment portfolio isn\u2019t \u201csexy\u201d, but it is how successful people being building their empire. And if i can just guess, you're looking at this Quora thread because you want to be like those successful people. For those of you reading this who aren\u2019t fresh out the womb like myself, you too can still benefit from time value of money. Being around the block means you know whats going to lose you money and whats going to make you money. Part of Time value being an effective concept is the insinuation that your money goes up in value each year. For people with less knowledge and lower risk aversion, the likelihood it increases each year is less than someone who know a thing or two about life. Appreciation: To make it simple Appreciation is the opposite of depreciation, where the assets increases in value as time goes on. For anyone whose bought/owned a car, you\u2019re very familiar with how depreciation works. The second that $30,000 car touches the road outside the dealership its worth no more than $26,999 because of depreciation. Appreciation, like i said, works in reverse to that principal. Here\u2019s and example: In 2002 my grandmother bought a dusty 4 bed 4 bath cabin in the rustic mountain town of Lake Arrowhead California. She purchased the home for $50,000 and has put in another $50,000 over the past 17 years making it livable, maintenance costs, and adding a deck to the second story. Today Zillow says that house is worth $260,000, meaning shes made $160,000 in 19 years just simply not letting that cabin erode from rat poop. That my friends is the power of appreciation live and well. Because of economic factors like inflation, housing shortages, and access to financing options, my grandmother made about $8,400 per year sitting on her butt. This is all while my family used that sweet cabin every summer and winter to the absolute fullest! Don\u2019t get it mistaken though, not every property appreciates or appreciates well. Some grow faster than the cabin example did, some lose value because people simply don\u2019t want to live in that area. This part of Real Estate investing is where the true skill comes into play. Being able to foresee the demand of an area years in advance takes years of practice. Some people are fortunate enough to walk into a good situation, but if you want to have prolonged success at real estate, knowing what makes a good market and a bad market is life or death. You could buy a house in a good city, but in a bad neighborhood and it will never take off how the surrounding area do. Real Estate is a proven Wealth creator that requires just as much of a commitment to time as it does to learning the game. I promise to you, if you take the time to get into Real Estate, and commit to it, you'll look back 10 years later and be angry you didn't start sooner. ",

            "answer_text": "Real Estate as a profession  is for people who have the \"staying power\". That's  the ability  to  continue  in the business  without  earning any income  for prolonged periods  of time. For that  you  need  to be fairly thick skinned. To become  an agent  is easy but  to make  it a life  time  career  is hard. However, it's not that bad if you you are able to take lots of rejections during  the first couple  of  years. Firstly you need to look businesslike  and presentable. You need a nice looking clean 4 door car that is less than say 7 years old.You need enough money to sustain  you for 6 months without  an income. You need to be well spoken and be a people  person  with indefatigable  energy. Now that we've  covered the basics  we need you to go on to the  second part. You need to get a system in place to bring you success. Always remember  that  buyers  are generally  liyers. Their expectations  are generally  higher than what they can afford. So they may want a 4 bedroom home but can only afford  a 2 or 3 bedroom home. They may want a 3 bathroom  home  but their budget  allows for only 1 and half bathroom. They may need to put down 20 to 25 % as a  down-payment  but they only have 5 to 10% down. They may want a single family home but can only qualify for a townhouse  or a condo.  So, work as little as possible  with  buyers.  Instead, learn how to be  a  successful  lister. Take some  courses  on How to list real estate. Check out  courses by Jerry Bresser, Mike Ferry, Tom Hopkins, Zig ZIGLER and Hank Thistle.  Learn to set annual, semi annual, quarterly, monthly, biweekly, weekly and daily goals and daily  action plans. Learn to give professional  market evaluation  presentations. Learn to solicit  business and farm areas. Get some knowledge  on creative financing, networking, overcoming  rejections and closing deals. There are many books on these subjects. I would  encourage  you  to become  an avid reader. Now that you know what to do, JUST DO IT ! It will all be trial and error initially  but if you hang in you'll  be okay. F.Y.I. I used to have an average of 72 deals a year in a bad year  and 96 deals in a good year.I used to generally  work  10 months  in a year. The key to Real Estate  success  is knowledge, the ability  to  be a master  lister, the utmost  sincere discipline . As one of my mentors put it \" With prayers for the soul, exercise for the body, and with good will and cooperation  in your mind, you will always  succeed. Good luck and hope my answer will be of some use to you. ",
