            "answer_text": "Art had a couple important functions: first, as a way of depicting religious imagery since the common man was illiterate, and secondly as a show of wealth through commissioned portraiture by well off men (which often showcased his wife of a good pedigree, her jewels, and lush clothing). Art was also closely tied to science. Take for example the many architectural sites shown in any art history books. Did you know many of the great painters you know of also sculpted, and designed and built massive buildings? Pretty impressive stuff. Art has always been a foundation to civilization. It is the keeper of our history in a way books can only dream. For the Medieval times, this was the same, but there was just a thicker history on which to build upon. ",
