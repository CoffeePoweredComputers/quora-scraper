            "answer_text": "LOL...a of these answers appear to be written by folks who spend too much time at the Renfest or playing with the Society for Creative Anachronism. Let's sum up the Medieval Ages and you can decide for yourself how depressing or not they might have been. First, the Medieval age covered a lot of time, 5th to the 15th Century, so around 1000 years. It began when the Roman Empire collapsed. Now, despite what you may have heard, Gaul and other Celtic areas of Europe \"conquered\" by the Romans were not undeveloped areas occupied by savages. The Celts had a well developed trade system between cities rather like the fortified cities we see in the Medieval period. THAT is why the Romans coveted the place. You don't go into an area and occupy it and have to pump a lot of money into it before you get a return if you can help it. It is much better to take over a rich, thriving area and get an immediate return on the cost of conquest. The Romans did it and the Muslims did it later.Okay so when Roman rule broke down, Europe descended back to the way it had been under the Celts, independent city states trading with one another. This led to fragmentation and later consolidation under the likes of Charlemagne and claimants to various thrones across Europe. Of course this led to frequent wars over control and of course religion. Let's not forget that nearly everyone was illiterate. Knowledge is power and so the monarchies and the church kept everyone dumb and stupid. It was in their best interest to retain power. They promoted superstition both religious and otherwise to instill fear and to further control the masses. Imagine the awe an illiterate peasant felt upon walking into a cathedral with all it's carefully contrived stain glass lighting, acoustics and pageantry. Surely they knew that they were in the house of god and all the iconography reinforced all the stories they had been taught about the apostles and such. It was great mind conditioning.Then you have feudalism itself, springing from the Monarchies and rule by divine right. People were bound to the land, because land was useless if you did not have virtual slaves to work it for you in order to pay taxes so that the royals and church didn't have to work. The Muslims during the Conquest found that out too. They had to forbid the Christians and Zoroastrians in the conquered territories to remain under threat of death, so that someone could pay taxes to maintain the infrastructure. Think of this, you have all these great cities in the Middle East and N. Africa. What is a city? A collection of merchants and craftsmen, administrators, and priests. But where does the \"stuff\" come from? Ah, yes, the countryside. The food, the ore, the wood, everything a city needs to be a city comes from without. So if the farmers, miners, and woodsmen flee, the city collapses into chaos. Taxes are needed to pay the royals, the administrators, and the military to keep the workers, the farmers in their place. It is a vicious cycle.All this was happening in the Middle ages. Now the average human produces 1.5 lbs of shit and day. So any sizable city has a sewage problem. A big city has a HUGE problem. A city of say 100,000 people produces 150,000 pound of shit a day, or 75 TONS of shit a day. Since there were no sewage systems, it is pretty obvious where it went. Some people might say that I am full of shit, that the people handled it. Well, New Orleans did not have a functioning city sewage system until 1898! People used out houses dug in the interior courtyards of their homes. Needless to say the ground water wells each home had were worthless and water had to be brought in by wagon from the Mississippi River. I just use this as an example. Just like in the Civil War, Medieval folks just shat where they were when nature called. Some of the waste might have been taken out to the fields but most of it went into the streets Or around the nearest bush where the people defecated.There is a reason women of breeding carried perfumed hankies, or flower bouquets, because the pervading smell of a town was of sewage. The Church and the rampant sewage that ran off into the nearest creek or river with the latest rain, caused most water courses to be unhealthy and disease ridden. The Medieval times proved the rule that \"only the strong survive\" when it came to resistance to disease. Sure people got used to it, but the populations were virgin territory to the likes of the Bubonic Plagues and other pathogens brought in from far away places by ship. Ones the pathogen was there it quickly spread. Why? Because no one had any concept of bacteria or virus. The Church said it was unhealthy to bathe, out of a well founded fear of the disease ridden water and a very virulent anti-sex attitude that gave root to prudery that is still a hallmark of the Christian faith today at least in America. So you have human shit everywhere, you have diseases picking off the weak or those with compromise immune systems due to age or injury. It took a while but the raw sewage coming out of London into the Thames killed off the huge oystery that existed there by the 1800's. It took a while longer for the same thing to happen in New York, one of the world's largest oysteries. Then you have livestock.Ah, yes, livestock. Since land was strictly controlled by the upper classes, the wear withal to own and care for a horse was strictly curtailed for the average person. This went back to Roman times where the Equestrian class while not royal, was seen just a notch below them. This carried over into the Medieval times, since having a horse was essentially advertising you were a person of some means. Since the land belonged to the Monarch or his vassals, barons, dukes and so on, if followed that only those in his favor would have holdings enough to have horses. Of course the Church had horses too because they had land as well. So if there were cattle or sheep, they usually belonged to the lord of the manor who in his turn was subject to the king or his proxy.That is why beef was a rarity on the commoner's table. Much like the Hindu, they knew that a cow can provide milk, cheese and butter for years, whereas If you kill it and eat it, it only provides food for a very limited time. It just didn't lead to cows becoming \"holy\" in Europe. Ducks, geese, pigs and goats were within the commoners grasp, since they did not need large holdings to raise and could roam the streets and help clean them up, so to speak, but also added their own waste to the city bouquet. I haven't even mentioned the effluent from the various trades: Butchers, tanners, wood workers, metallurgists, alchemists all added their own \"pollutants\" to the streets. In a city or town, things were very constrained. For instance, the baker ran his ovens nearly 24/7 and selling his wares could afford fuel. He made money on the side by taking in cooking from the city dwellers who could not afford fuel. It was still common into the late 1800's in London. Read Dickens. Game was strictly controlled by the Monarchs because they knew if the common people were allowed uncontrolled hunting rights all the big game would cease to exist. Small game, birds, rabbits and other rodents were \"fair game.\" That might actually be where the English term comes from. Food from the Seas was uncontrolled for those who had access to it. In a cook book I have called 700 Years of English Cooking, the author takes pains to point out that it represented not the common man's table fair but that of the wealthy or royal kitchens. So we have the smell of shit, the smell of unwashed bodies, filth, dirt and grime. How long did this persist? Well certainly for most of the Medieval age, when things started to get better into the 1400 and 1500s the whole chivalry thing was in vogue. The Church was at it's peak of power, but women still did not shave their legs or armpits. Hell in Germany and Norway in the 1970's they still didn't. I know I lived there and dated women from there and Italy as well. My Italian damsels had dark hairy legs and thick thatches of armpit hair. You don't even want to know about...well let's just say they did not know what a bikini wax was and a weed-wacker would have come in handy. Oh, dentistry. Yeah, a lot of rotten teeth. Here is a comparison. All the portraits throughout time show unsmiling people, because most had rotten or missing teeth. King Louis the Sun King of France had a perforated sinus due to his physician trying to treat an abscessed tooth with a hot poker...repeatedly. This was substantially after the Medieval period. G. Washington's famous dental problems occurred seven hundred years AFTER the Medieval period so you cannot tell me that dental health improved. Sure, sure there are a lot of battlefield skulls with great teeth, but those guys were in the prime of their lives and a fair number are missing teeth. Today, to hear dentists talk periodontal disease is still rampant, so, I imagine halitosis was a persistent problem in the Medieval period when tooth brushes and mouth wash were unheard of unless you had contacts in China. Warfare. How can to say that warfare wasn't brutal and repulsive when the methodology consisted of slicing, hacking, dismembering, puncturing or crushing the head, limbs or torso of your opponent?Considering the medical profession of the day, an immediate non fatal puncture wound of the torso meant a lingering death by putrefaction and sepsis. If you lost a limb and did not bleed out, then you might have survived. A crushing wound to the head or limb meant permanent in capacity or disfigurement. There were not many old folks homes for soldiers. They were in fact in the majority militia drawn from the farmer peasant class. Only a small number were professional soldiers. So if you lost a hand, arm, or foot and survived, it might well mean your family would starve if you could not work to provide for them. If all this was true how then did Europe pull itself out of the mire and rise to such heights? The way they always did, by having sex. There never seemed to be a lack of fresh bodies. Even after the Black Death killed off over 30% of the population of Europe, twice, the population bounced right back. After all, having sex is what people are good at. That is the REASON we exist, to have progeny. Just like Salmon we only exist to have the next generation of offspring and we strive mightily to see that we do it. So despite all the filth, death, poor diet, disease, religion, war and shit in the Medieval period, people were still having sex and still producing kids, lots and lots of kids. My grand parents in the 1940's on both sides had a total of 13 kids, which is small by comparison with Italian families which might have 24. My maternal grand mother had around 30 grand kids, I was the third oldest. I went to school in the 1970's with some \"good\" Catholic girls who came from families of 12 kids or more. Lucky for me, they weren't so good as their parents might have thought and were getting a head start practicing for having big families of their own. ",

            "answer_text": "Not even close. I appreciate that open-minded people like you ask questions like this, and it is unfortunate that the least-informed answers tend to be the ones that get pushed up if they are well-written and feature provocative images. I will outline only a few examples that refute the common misconception of the Middle Ages, and you can do your own further research. I recommend books and scholarly articles over movies and documentaries. For starters, Medieval warfare was less barbaric than even Roman rules of engagement. Rather than simply besieging the city and asking questions later, the general rule of Medieval warfare was this: The besieging noble would offer terms of surrender. If these were accepted, the whole city would be spared. If not, then the entire city, loot, lives, and all, was fair game. However, if surrender was accepted during the siege, the original terms would recommence. Moreover, knights generally held to some code of conduct, perhaps some form of chivalry, the conduct of their lord, or Crusading principles, such as temperance, chastity, and constraint. This made rape and other brutalities less common than in past periods. Medieval child rearing was far more civil than it had ever been before outside of Judaism. No longer could the family simply leave their female or deformed children exposed to the wilderness to die so that they would have fewer mouths to feed. Instead, based on biblical principles, the raising of children was seen as the purpose of life for the common person. Not only this, but the pervasiveness of Mariology allowed women to live on more equal footing with men than most other periods, certainly more so than during the Enlightenment. Feudalism was a far less oppressive system, even for the lowest serf, than Roman slavery. Medieval Europe was the only society to have in principle abolished slavery, certainly for as long as 500 years. Feudalism was a form of social contract between a vassal and his lord. If a king began to overstep, that would be a sure way to cause a revolt, thereby either ending his lordship or forcing him to sign a document like the Magna Carta. He was not an absolute dictator like those during the Early Modern Period, but, with his vassals, a \u201cfirst among equals.\u201d Because of these contractual agreements, i.e., military service for land, Medieval feudalism was the most effective way of protecting private property and personal rights than any system that had yet been conceived and among the best conceived since then, and this was done on purpose because of my next point. Though it is often unfortunately ignored, Medieval philosophy, which combined the ancients with Christian thought, progressed Western Civilization and laid the groundwork for Renaissance and Enlightenment thinkers more than the latter would have liked to admit. Before the late antiquity and Medieval thinkers, not one western philosopher had considered the idea that human beings were a good in themselves. However, Christian thinkers, after contemplating the sacrifice of Christ, and knowing that every human being was made in the image of God, realized that even the \u201cfarthest Mysian,\u201d as Aristotle put it, was worthy of love and justice, even if bringing that person justice would not be beneficial for one\u2019s self. Self-sacrificial love and the sovereignty of men have their foundations not in the Enlightenment, but in Medieval thinking. Only the mention of things like republicanism, the University, checks-and-balances, and *inventions still in use today, like mechanical clocks and glasses, will have one reconsider his perception of the period. And why should this be surprising? Christianity permeated the lives of these people; it was virtually inescapable. This in no way could possibly have made Medieval Europe more barbaric than any other period in history, and it in fact had the opposite effect. *If you are interested in other scientific advancements in thought and practice, I will make a brief mention of the 13th-century alchemist Roger Bacon, who formulated an early version of the scientific method, hypothesized that the speed of light was finite, may have created his own telescope, and, after experimenting with gunpowder, even predicted the invention of combustion engines and flying machines!
