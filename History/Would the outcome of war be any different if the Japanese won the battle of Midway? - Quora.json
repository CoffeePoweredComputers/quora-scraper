            "answer_text": "I will start this answer with the following statement. Some time ago, ten or more years ago, I read an article/ paper on this very question. I don\u2019t remember where I read this so I cannot reference the source. The article/paper stated that the US Navy had conducted a study or wargame (I don\u2019t remember) shortly after the war ended using all of the information available from both sides. It found that the war would have been extended by about six weeks with the same outcome as what actually happened, which is the surrendering of Japan. I was a little taken back by this finding and was intrigued. What follows is a reconstruction of that finding. First the sitting: we will assume that the US Navy (USN) suffered a total loss. That is all three carriers were sunk and none of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) carriers were sunk. The Japanese would still have suffered aircraft losses, though not total losses like what actually happened. Carrier on carrier battles in World War II were brutal on the air groups involved. The IJN lost the following number of aircraft in these battles: Battles of Coral Sea -lost 92 out of 127 aircraft (72% loss); Eastern Solomons - lost 75 out of 130 (57%) and at Santa Cruz -lost 99 out 199 (50%). This averages out to about a 60% loss. The losses were also concentrated on the torpedo and dive bomber aircraft. This makes sense as those aircraft deliberately entered the anti-aircraft defense zones of the very ships they (and escorts) were attacking. This means it is reasonable to expect that only 99 aircraft out of the original 248 aircraft committed to battle would still be available after the US carriers are sunk and most of them would be fighters. The one light carrier with the First Fleet Main task force (IJN Hosho) had only 8 aircraft and they were Yokosuka B4Y torpedo biplanes. In the Second Fleet Main task force, there was the light carrier Zuiho with an additional 12 A6M2 Zeke fighters and 12 Kate torpedo bombers. Despite losing all carriers, it is also reasonable to expect some of the US aircraft to land at Midway itself. In the actual battle, the US lost 150 aircraft out of 233 carrier based and 127 land based. A similar number would be available for the coming battle. If we only take half of the surviving carrier based aircraft making it to Midway after losing their carriers, that would mean there would be 40 Wildcat fighters, 54 Dauntless dive bombers and maybe 2 Devastator torpedo aircraft landing there. The island air group by this point had one Avenger torpedo bomber, one B-26 medium bomber , 17 B-17 heavy bombers, 19 Dauntless dive bombers, 15 Vindicator dive bombers, 8 Buffalo fighters and 5 Wildcats. This is a total of 150 or more aircraft. So in the air, the US would still a larger number of aircraft available that is until the IJN starting shelling the airfields. Also at this point in the battle, none of the 31 Catalina PBY aircraft had been lost. They would be valuable for the battle to come. The remaining surfaces vessels of the US task forces would withdraw back to Pearl Harbor and the IJN task forces would move forward and invest Midway. The submarines of Task Groups 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 would remain to attack and interdict the Japanese. They were composed of 18 submarines that would be ordered into battle. The US Navy was using a faulty torpedo (Mark 14) at this point in the war. It would suffer an 80% failure rate until late 1943. The impact they could have had is considerable though. Even with a faulty torpedo, US Submarine S-44 sank the IJN Heavy Cruiser Kako in September 1942 with a spread of four torpedoes. Japanese anti-submarine warfare capabilities were below average compared to other navies, particularly the Royal Navy. Their destroyers being equipped more for surface action and having poor quality sonar equipment. A high number of IJN destroyers fell victim to the very submarines they were supposed to be hunting. So the surviving surfaces vessels of the IJN move to invest Midway Island. What happens then is the Japanese land troops to take the island. These troops, after very possibly fierce fighting, are pushed back into the ocean. \u201cWhat?!?\u201d you are thinking! I will explain below why I think this is the most likely possibly. Historical Context #1 (Wake Island - 23 December 1941) First we have to go back six months before the Battle of Midway, to 23 December 1941 and the second invasion of Wake Island. Wake Island was defended by 450 Marines of the 1st Defense Battalion. A defense Battalion was a special unit designed and tasked with the defense of fixed coastal locations. The 1st Defense Battalion had three batteries of 5\u201d guns, four batteries of 3\u201d anti-aircraft guns, a SCR 268 fire control radar and a SCR 270B search radar. In addition, there were two machine gun companies each with twenty four M2 0.50-caliber machine guns and two beach protection companies, each with twenty-four 0.30-caliber machine guns However, one of the 3\u201d batteries was short its fire control equipment. In addition, attached radar sets for Wake were sitting on a dock in Pearl Harbor in 7 December and never arrived at Wake. The Marines had started arriving at Wake in August 1941 with the bulk of the unit in place by October and had only a few weeks in which to prepare defenses on the island before the start of the war. Construction of defenses was slow because the civilian work force was tasked with the naval air station first The Marines were assisted by about 200 civilians who were on the island constructing the facilities to expand operations before the war started. There were four Wildcat fighters providing air support of the original 12 Wildcats still flying. Eight of the original twelve Wildcats had been destroyed on the first day of the war in the Pacific. The map below shows the defensive layout of the US positions and Japanese landing beaches. As part of the defensive plan, caches of supplies were scattered around the three islands so defenders could resupply whenever they were in limited terms.  The first invasion had been turned away before the Japanese had landed any troops on 11 December. For the next 12 days before the 23 December landings, the Marine defenders had been under almost consist air attack. So much so, that Devereux later described \u201cthe foggy blur of days and nights when time stood still. The men\u2019s days blurred together in a dreary sameness of bombing and endless work and always that aching need for sleep. I have seen men standing with their eyes open, staring at nothing, and they did not hear me when I spoke to them.\u201d The second however saw the landing of 1,500 troops of the Japanese Maizuru Second Special Naval Landing Force landed on Wake Island and Wilkes Island in the Wake Atoll before dawn. Carrier aircraft from Soryu and Hiryu provided support by attacking targets on Wilkes, Peale, and Wake Islands. The Japanese landed 100 troops on Wilkes Island with the bulk on Wake itself. After the Japanese thought they had secured the Wilkes Island, the defenders counter-attacked and essentially wiped out the Japanese. Only two survived the battle. No Japanese troops had landed on Peale. The 5\u201d guns on that island had driven off IJN destroyers that had moved in to provide fire support on Wake. All of the 5\u201d guns positions were camouflaged prior to start of hostilities, so none of them were knocked out before the island surrendered. On Wake, the situation was far from hopeless. Battery A had been cut off but the Japanese had been stopped from advancing. A counter-attack by 55 men had temporarily forced the Japanese to retreat back to their landing zones. However, Lt Col. Devereux (the US Marine commander) was unaware of these positive developments. Communication between the islands was cut early in the battle. HE could only see what was going around him. By the afternoon of 23 December, he recommended to Cmdr. Cunningham (overall US Commander) that the situation was hopeless. They surrendered later that day. It is possible, if communications had not been cut, that Devereux could have reinforced Wake from Peale and Wilkes. With these forces, pushing the Japanese off the island could have been possible. The Japanese had only the single wave of forces which were all committed at this point. They had no second wave off shore that could be landed or supplies to aide those ashore. The ships off shore and aircraft overhead could not take the island without troops on shore. That was a battle of 1500 Japanese against 400 Marines (plus 200 civilians). Three to one odds, which is the generally excepted ratio for an attacker trying to take a defended position. The Japanese had lost almost 400 personnel, two ships and ten aircraft. US causalities were 49 Marines, three Navy personnel and 70 civilians. For 12 days before 23 December landings, the defenders had been under almost consist air attack. So much so, that Devereux later described \u201cthe foggy blur of days and nights when time stood still. The men\u2019s days blurred together in a dreary sameness of bombing and endless work and always that aching need for sleep. I have seen men standing with their eyes open, staring at nothing, and they did not hear me when I spoke to them.\u201d So, we have an understrength Marine Defense Unit that was underequipped in position for less than nine months. The attacking Japanese had a three to one advantage and were fought to virtual standstill. Midway would be very different and much worse for the Japanese. Midway Defenses First, the Marines on Midway starting arriving in May 1940, two years before the battle. This first party was a survey team to layout gun positions and other facilities required for the planned garrison. By September 1940, the first detachments of the 3rd Defense Battalion starting arriving and work commenced on defensive works. The complete battalion was in place by February 1941. By July 1942, there were three batteries of 5\u201d guns installed as well as three batteries of 3\u201d anti-aircraft guns. Communication and beach defense trenches had been dug. That month also saw the arrival of the 6th Defense Battalion to bolster the garrison\u2019s strength. In November 1941, the defenders at Midway had their defense bolstered by the addition of two batteries of 7\u201d guns and additional 3\u201d anti-aircraft guns. After the fall of Wake, the reinforcements (4th Defense Battalion detachment) intended for the Wake garrison were diverted to Midway. So the strength on Midway in May 1942 was as follows: - 3rd, 4th and 6th Marine Defense Battalions which numbers 141 officers and 2886 enlisted personnel. There were also small detachments of Army (407th Signal Company) and Navy personnel which numbered several hundred more. - Also two companies of the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion, a further 270 men. The defense of Midway included: four 7\u201d guns, six 5\u201d guns, twenty-four 3\u201d dual purpose guns, eight 37mm anti-aircraft guns, eighteen 20mm anti-aircraft guns, forty-two 0.50 caliber machine guns, thirty 0.30 machine guns and five M3 Stuart light tanks. There were eight motor torpedo boats located in the lagoon that would bolster the anti-aircraft defenses. Sand Island alone was ringed by a double ring of wire obstacles as well as other locations. Concrete bunkers had been constructed alone the beaches. Mine fields were emplaced in the water and on the beaches. The water laid mines consisted of sections of sewer pipe filled with explosives. Underwater obstacles were constructed to damage and sink landing craft. On the beaches, fragmentation mines were constructed from ammunition boxes filled with nails. They could be control detonated or triggered by rifle fire on their exposed sides. Anti-tank mines were improvised out of cigar boxes and Molotov cocktails were prepared at every position. All of the gun positions were camouflaged like those at Wake.  As you can see in the map of the Midway defenses, there are two avenues of approach to the islands of Midway: Seward Roads and Brooks Channel. The layout of the gun positions covers both. Reefs surround the Midway atoll and crossing over them in a landing craft was virtually impossible. In a way, this is very similar to the US landing at Tarawa in 1943 except the Japanese would not have tracked vehicles to cross the reefs in. Japanese Invasion Force The invasion force for Midway consisted of 1500 troops of the Special Naval Landing Force who would land on Sand Island. An additional 1000 Army troops of the Ikki Detachment would land on Eastern Island. They were in turn backed up by the 11th and 12th Construction Battalions. This amounted to almost 5000 troops landing against just over 3000 Marine defenders. Actually, the initial assault forces would be virtually one to one. Naval fire support was delegated to Cruiser Division 7 with the heavy cruisers Kumano, Mogami, Mikuma, Suzuya and escorting destroyer screen. The IJN did have battleships as part of the operation, included the battleship Yamato. However, the IJN did not have a doctrine for using capital ships for fire support. Neither did the US for the matter at this point in the war. The reefs and limited approaches were known by the Japanese prior to start of the operation. It was expected that the landing craft to be used would not be able to cross the reefs. Instead, the landing troops were expected to transfer to rubber boats and land using them. The extent and strength of the Marine defenses were not known. Assault on Midway The assault on Midway would probably by a slaughter for the Japanese. First, the radar units on Midway would see the IJN ships as they crossed the horizon. Even before this, the aircraft on Midway, particularly the PBY Catalina aircraft would be used to locate and track the IJN task forces as them moved towards Midway. The Japanese were not expecting to be facing the guns that were actually emplaced on Midway. Cruiser Division Seven would first attempt a pre-invasion bombardment of the Sand and eastern islands. However, they most likely would have been driven off by the guns on Midway, similar to what happened at Wake. Something else to consider at this point, the Japanese never really established a doctrine, units or procedures for naval fire support for troops ashore. The troops onshore did not have the capability to communication targeting information to ships off shore. Historical Context #2 (Guadalcanal) The IJN did try to knock out the airfield at Guadalcanal using capital ships (Haruna and Kongo). They fired over 970 high explosive rounds at Henderson Field on 14 October 1942. The damage inflected though did not knock the air group (the Cactus Air Force). Despite the damage to the airfield, a strike mission was still launched at dawn against the Japanese ships. So, even if the Japanese used their capital ships against targets at Midway, they couldn\u2019t significantly damage the defense let alone destroy them. So what would have happened? The pre-invasion bombardment would have been ineffective and the ships involved driven off by the guns of the defenders. The remaining Japanese aircraft at best would have fought the remaining US aircraft to a draw with neither establishing air superiority over the other side. The US would have air superiority over Midway, the Japanese over their task forces. The Japanese landing forces would start to approach their landing zones. Those that moved through the two clear approaches would be subjected to substantial fire from interlocking fields of fire from Marine positions. Those troops that had to transfer to rubber boats would do so under fire from Marine positions. If any troops survived this gallant of fire, they would land on a beach with wire obstacles and land mines. A significant number of troops would not make it this far. The initial assault wave would have an almost one to one attacker to defender ratio. A three to one is the lowest ratio commonly used for planning purposes. The experience of the US assaults in the Pacific from 1943 to 1945 showed that six to one was a better planning assumption for assaulting defended island positions. Even if the IJN used capital ships to bombard the island, it is unlikely the Marine defenders would surrender from this alone. The Japanese troops would be literally pushed back into the water and Midway would remain in US possession. The Japanese would now be in a difficult position. The entire IJN task force would have to withdraw back to support base, most likely Truk. Why? The IJN did not possess the resources to sustain a fleet at sea for lengthy periods of time. They never came close to what the US developed by 1944 at blue water operations at distant locations. So a week (two at most) after the initial air battle, the IJN has withdrawn and Midway is still in US possession. What next? The US would be reduced to three carriers total: USS Saratoga, Wasp and Ranger. USS Ranger was originally deemed to be too small and slow for operations in the Pacific which is why she spent the entire war in the Atlantic. Now however, she is most likely transferred to the Pacific. Any carrier is better than no carrier. The US would also not conduct the raids she had be conducting with her carriers since the start of the war. Guadalcanal would still have to be invaded in August 1942 because the threat of a Japanese base there could not be ignored. For the Japanese, the four carriers would have to withdraw back to Japan to rebuild their air groups. For context, the two surviving carriers from the Battle of Coral Sea (Zuikaku and Shokaku) required seven months to rebuild their air groups. Keep in mind, they lost 72% of their air groups in that battle which amounted to 90 aircraft. The Battle of Midway we are discussing here would have seen the Japanese lose almost 150 aircraft, spread across all four carriers. It is reasonable to expect that January 1943 is the earliest that the survivors of Midway could be expected to conduct operations again. This is because the training program for IJN pilots was long, slow and small. It did produce some of the best pilots before the war but once fighting started, it was never up the requirements wartime loses were incurring. Eventually, the program was reduced to speed up pilot training but this came at a cost in overall effectiveness. By 1945, they were receiving a fraction of flying hours compared to flying hours US pilots were receiving at that time. In the six months following the battle, the carrier strength of Japan would be higher the US: USS Saratoga (88 aircraft) and USS Wasp (76) vs Zuikaku (84), Shokaku (84), Ryujo (38) and Zuiho (30). The number of aircraft carried is the most that could be carried and in some cases they would actually be understrength. By June 1943, the US would have added USS Essex (82), USS Independence (33) and USS Princeton (33) and the IJN would have back its Kaga (90), Akagi (91), Soryu (71) and Hiryu (73). The ratio would 321 US aircraft to 561 Japanese aircraft. By the fall of 1943, the US has pulled ahead with Bunker Hill (91), Yorktown (91), Lexington II (91), Intrepid (91), Belleau Wood (33), Cowpens (33), Monterey (33), Langley (33) and Cabot (33). Notice, that aside from the survivors of Midway, the Japanese would add no new carriers. The first new carriers they would add would be Chiyoda (30) and Chitose (30) in 1944 at the earliest. So, by the fall of 1943, the US has not only equaled the Japanese carrier strength but pulled head. The numbers get worse after this for Japan. Part of the problem was the layout and method of shipbuilding in Japan. They were not ideally suited to expansion like US shipyards were. Following the Battle of Midway and loss of their carrier force, they did order the construction of new carriers and conversions of ships into carriers to make up for the shortfall they now had. They were hampered not only be limited shipyards but power plants as well. They could not make the required power plants for the new carriers fast enough. This is why some of the new carriers that were built were constructed using destroyer sized engines instead of the required cruiser sized engines originally planned. This resulted in lower top speeds and short operating ranges for these carriers. The Japanese planned building a 14 ship run of the Unryu class. These were smaller than the Essex class the US was building, carrying only 65 aircraft to the Essex 91. In addition, all of those new carriers would require escort groups. The Japanese planned on 2.5 destroyers and 1.2 cruiser per carrier. This was based on the number of escorts used for the first half of the war. This assumed that the IJN would not lose any of the existing escorts in the time being as well. Under the plan for the new carriers, they needed 30 new destroyers and 12 cruisers. In actuality, they constructed 30 destroyers in the entire war and only 5 light cruisers. This would not even counter wartime losses let alone form new escort groups. I already talked about the shortage of pilots they would suffer as the war went on. The Japanese had no hope of matching the industrial output of the US and planned for a short war. They planned on defeating the US in a decisive battle that would weaken US resolve and lay the ground work for a negotiated peace. This is what happened the last time the Japan had challenged a major power: Russia. In the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, a series of defeats by the Japanese had forced the Russian government to negotiate a settlement. However, the Japanese failed to account for the resolve of the US following the attack on Pearl Harbor and all of the feelings that stirred up. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope \u2026 it would have come out the same. I think you could even make a credible argument that Japan might have fallen faster. OK, OK, I know that sounds wild, but hear me out. The loss of US battleships at Pearl Harbor forced the US Navy to focus on aircraft carriers to a greater degree than they would have otherwise; this turned out to be a strategic advantage over the Japanese who still viewed the battleship as a decisive factor. Now, suppose the carriers were gone as well, what is left? Of course, submarines! The US would have had to focus all its immediate effort on unrestricted submarine warfare and, having the Germans as a model in both world wars, the USN would focus on shipping rather than naval forces. This change of emphasis has a few profound alterations on the US submarine fleet. US subs had problems with faulty torpedoes throughout the first half of the war as the weapons bureau refused to believe incoming reports and swept the matter under the rug. With submarines now receiving the bulk of scrutiny, it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that this situation would have been remedied earlier. Likewise, seniority would be less important to a sub skippers career \u2026 conservative officers would have been even more quickly weeded out in favor of those more aggressive souls who racked up enemy kills. This all-out unrestricted submarine warfare has the effect of depriving Japanese industry of critical materials needed to prosecute the war, starves the citizenry of the Home Islands and interrupts the flow of personnel and material to Japan\u2019s overseas forces. Their naval forces might not be sunk as rapidly as in our history, but it wouldn\u2019t be growing, either. There\u2019s no doubt that the carrier fleet would be rebuilt and the battleships salvaged to fight another day but, in the interim, it\u2019s possible the sub fleet would have been even more deadly than it already was.
