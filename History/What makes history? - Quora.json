            "answer_text": "History is time that has passed. Yesterday is History, an hour ago is History. Are you asking what makes some events more notable than others? I would suppose the events and what led up to them that caused pivotal change. Unless the Boston Tea Party had been catalytic in igniting the American Revolution it would have been overlooked as just some angry thugs destroying others property. In short a diary entry rather than the \u201chistoric\u201d event we are taught. Remember, it is the victors who write History. Always look at the other side as well to find the true picture of what was. ",

            "answer_text": "History is the study of mankind through the analysis of the content of written language, obviously in the past. Some of the history is written based on oral history, but only if some linguist, prior to reaching the hands of a historian, wrote it down. Events prior to written language are the realm of archaeologists, anthropologists, paleo-anthropologists, geologists, climatologists, etc., even cosmologists, but once they write it down, it will be gathered by the historians, who read what they have written, and try to put it all in place. like the history of prehistoric (meaning pre-written language) flint knapping, or the Neanderthals, for example. In short, historians write the great summary of all what has been written before, whether it is about science, mathematics, or Sumerian cuneiform. ",
