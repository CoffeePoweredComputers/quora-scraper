            "answer_text": "Not much is remembered about the A and N routes, which were predecessors to VOR routes. Even after VORs dominated the airways, A and N was required to be taught into the mid-1970s. The last route was decommissioned in about 1983. Like the VOR, the transmitting stations used highly directional antennas, which broadcast routes. Unlike VORs, the pilot could not select his inbound, or outbound radial. Typically, there were up to four routes available, but stations having only two or three were also common.  My crude diagram shows a typical A & N Airway. When inbound, the pilot would hear the mores code letter A (Alpha dit-dah) if left of course. If Right of course the mores code letter N (November (dah-dit) would be heard. Just as with the more modern VOR, the signal narrows as the airplane gets closer to the station. When the airplane\u2019s antenna is centered on course, the dit-dahs, and the dah-dits merge and form one single tone (back then it was a 1kc tone. Hertz was not used until 1969 - 1970). Station passage was signified by silence. The higher the airplane was, the longer would be the silence, as the null got wider with increased altitude. On the out bound leg, left of course and right of course switched. One disadvantage of this was that the pilot had to wear uncomfortable head phones, or have his radio turned up to hear the sound. During thunder storms and such, it would be difficult to hear the tones, and the signal was not always clear. Headphones used in modern aviation are super comfortable. But, those old ones were pure hell, and that is why most GA pilots did not wear them, and as a result lost some of their hearing. As VORs began coming on the scene, the pilot now had a visual aid that could be used for either VOR or A&N navigation. If you ever come across a very old VOR gauge, you may notice that one side has a blue arc and the other a yellow arc which represented right and left of course. Old IFR charts indicated A&N airways similarly to the depiction above. NDBs were available for use prior to WWII. These were not automatic, as the navigator would have to manually turn the antenna, usually by twisting a knob on the overhead of the cabin. The knob had an arrow attached which would point to a bearing on the outer ring of the dial. By tuning in two or more stations, the navigator could get a cross-fix of his position. After getting a cross-fix you could use your mag compass to determine if you were headed to the station or from the station. This method was also used on the ground to find spy radio transmitters. Two or more monitoring vans (trucks) would tune in a station, then orient their antennas to get a cross-fix in order to find the station. I forget the exact procedure, but by turning the airplane ninety-degrees to the station, and flying while the navigator turns his knob, then calculating the time, the navigator could determine the distance to the station. The advancement of the ADF made everything a lot easier. ",

            "answer_text": "Believe it or not, airliners do it the same way they used to do it before GPS. In addition to the systems that Tim Morgan mentions there is also the inertial reference system on bigger airplanes.  That system senses acceleration and uses it to derive velocity and in turn compute a position relative to an initial known position.  This used to be done with mechanical gyros requiring the aircraft to sit parked completely still at the gate while they spun up and initialized.  Now they are implemented with ring laser gyros.   IRS is extremely precise but has no accuracy in the sense that it does not have any absolute position awareness -- it only measures position relative to where it was.  So combining highly accurate GPS-derived positioning with highly precise IRS positioning gives modern jets an unbelievably accurate picture of their position. Having said all that, only VHF radios and certain installations of GPS are approved for primary means of navigation on bigger aircraft.  The GPS units installed in most airliners were not built to the same standard that so-called panel-mount IFR GPS receivers found in light airplanes were (TSO-C129A).   That is, the ones aboard airliners do not require augmentation from ground-based systems.  In the US, in order to use GPS as primary means, the system must use other systems (WAAS or GBAS), have certain buttons, and certain displays, all of which are incompatible with airline cockpits and implementations.  See GNSS Frequently Asked Questions - NAS Implementation for more information about GPS as primary means in the US. So technically speaking, airliners in the US cannot use GPS as a primary means of navigation -- they still have to use the VORs and NDBs.  Practically speaking, it doesn't matter, as the area navigation systems provided by the flight management system don't care where the positional information is sourced.  The fact remains that absent a special operational approval, the positional information must be sourced primarily from ground-based navigational aids, not GPS. ",

            "answer_text": "Not just jets, but pilots in general used a multitude of ways depending on the era. At first they did so using a map and compass. Later a stopwatch was added, along with an airspeed indicator. This allowed for dead-reckoning, that is keeping track of where you are by the direction, speed and time you had flown. In World War II long-range bombers had navigators trained to use sextants for celestial navigation. They even had a special bubble window on top of the plane to poke their head out for sitings. Later (1950s), radio navigation became common. Non-Directional Beacons (NDB) were ground based radios that pilots could use aircraft-mounted Direction Finders (DF and later Automatic Direction Finders- ADF) to locate and home in on. Then VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) came into use in the 1960s. It\u2019s a more advanced type of ground-based beacon that provides the pilot not jut with the direction to the beacon, but what their magnetic heading from the beacon is. This allows the pilot to fly inbound our outbound from the VOR along a specific radial. This was used to create the airway system still used for some IFR flights today. An addition to the VOR system was Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) which provides the range from the aircraft to a beacon. Often these beacons are co-located with VOR stations. If you know your distance and direction from a VOR/DME station, then you know where you are. Some aircraft also used systems like LORAN, but this was not very accurate, and mostly intended for use by ships. Still, airliners on trans-ocean routes would use it as there were no better options once you got 100 miles off-shore or so. EDIT: Thanks to Chris Habig for pointing out one other option I missed. Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) started showing up in Military Aircraft in the 1950s. They use gyroscopes and accelerometers to estimate the distance and direction the aircraft has moved from some initial position. So before the aircraft took off the INS would be aligned at some known point, then all navigation was done with reference to that point. These systems require no outside beacons or signals, so they can work far out to sea, but their error tends to grow the longer you fly. Some aircraft still use them as backups in case of a GPS failure. They can even be used in conjunction with GPS where the GPS signal is used to update the position constantly. That way the error that creeps in only begins to do so when the GPS signal is lost. ",

            "answer_text": "Prior to GPS, and when not in range of standard land based radio navigation aids, an inertial navigation system (INS) was utilized. There was a plethora of various INS systems based on a wide variety of different methods, as can be seen in this listing: http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/jetds/an-asn.html As a pilot in early model F-14As and before GPS, in addition to our standard tactical air navigation system (TACAN/DME ), we had an INS with a ring laser gyroscope . It was an ASN-130 (Airborne System Navigation \u2013 Model 130) Years earlier as a pilot in the F-4, we only had TACAN and DME for navigation, and no INS. Sometimes when on Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin, we flew from there to Naval Air Station Cubi Pt. in the Philippines, a distance of approximately 825 nautical miles/1528 km. Without an INS and no navigational aids en route we usually were required to fly on the wing of an A-7 or A-6 that did have an INS to navigate for us. One day I had to fly the route alone, and without navigation aids over the South China Sea, by inaccurate dead reckoning . [It was important to give the Paracel Islands a wide berth, because they would shoot at you if you were too close.) Nearing the last part of the flight I was happy to see up ahead, the high and towering white cloud formations up indicating there was likely land underneath them and not ocean. It meant I was still likely on course. About 130 miles from Cubi Pt. I finally picked up their TACAN signal and then navigated normally.

            "answer_text": "Mr. Pickard gave a great answer, and I just want to add a couple of things from a pilot\u2019s perspective. We are taught that there are 4 basic ways to navigate: pilotage, dead reckoning, celestial navigation, and use of radio aids. Pilotage means relying on visible landforms \u2014 roads or rivers, buildings or other landmarks, mountains or shorelines, either with or without the aid of a map and compass, to determine where you are. When walking from home to school or work, on a route they know well, even pedestrians are engaged in pilotage. The analytic database info you need for pilotage is \u201cin your head\u201d and the primary sensor for incoming data to compare to that database, is the Mark One Eyeball (or a pair of them, even better). Ships and boats also rely on pilotage when navigating harbors, rivers, and other constricted areas \u2014 which is why, even with a competent captain in charge, a large ship takes on a local pilot before entering a congested harbor, who can rely on his familiarity with the obstacles, docking locations, etc. to safely get the ship delivered to, or on its way out to sea from, its mooring or anchorage. That used to be the only way to get around, for anybody, by any type of transport. The slightly more sophisticated way to get around, on the open ocean or in the sea of air, is deduced (or \u201cded\u201d) reckoning, which most people spell \u201cdead\u201d reckoning. That involves pure mathematical calculation (\u201cdeduction\u201d) based on a combination of a known heading, and a known speed, and a known amount of passage of time, as of the last point where a precise fix on your moving vehicle\u2019s location could be obtained, to determine _approximately_ where you are in space. Inaccuracies are introduced not only because of the normal range of error inherent in the instrumentation (a magnetic compass, a speed indicator, and a clock), but, even when using the most refined and accurate instrumentation available, because of unknown and unpredictable factors such as wind drift, current drift (in water navigation), and even ever-so-slight deviations of the helmsman from the assigned and intended heading. Wind and current can also speed up or slow down the over-the-ground speed, also affecting the calculation of actual location. The upshot is, the longer the time a vessel continues to navigate using _only_ dead reckoning, the more inaccurate its position estimates become, because all of the introduced errors are cumulative. That\u2019s why an airplane pilot seeking to navigate by dead reckoning will still look out the window and follow his course using pilotage whenever possible, to help stay on course, and will plan a flight using relatively short dead-reckoning segments between known and visible location \u201cfixes\u201d on the ground, so that, upon passing his plane over that known marker, he can re-start the dead reckoning process all over again on the next leg, resetting to zero the accumulated error of the preceding leg. At sea, this may not be possible for days at a time, so, back in the day, that\u2019s one reason why every ship still needed a lookout, to spot land and resume visual pilotage as soon as possible even if the \u201cdead reckoning\u201d predicted you wouldn\u2019t reach land for another half a day or so (equally frequent, but less of a hazard unless you were running out of water and food, was if it would take _longer_ than predicted to reach land). Then, of course, once you _did_ spot land, you would have to resort to pilotage to figure out just how off course you were \u2014 is that bay we were heading for upwind, or downwind? Celestial navigation involves the taking of location and direction \u201cfixes,\u201d using a sextant, on two or three known celestial objects (stars or planets) whose location in the sky at any given point in time is known with great precision, and published in almanacs used by navigators for that purpose. Then the navigator draws lines leading to the known position of those celestial objects, on a map, and triangulates those positions to find where the vessel is. Doing this successfully takes a lot of training and knowledge, as well as precise optical and timekeeping equipment, charts, and almanacs, and is rarely used today due to availability of much easier-to-use methods for finding precisely where one is. Finally, radio aids. I won\u2019t elaborate on Mr. Pickard\u2019s very complete answer here, except to note that all of the methods he discussed are still in use at various locations on the globe, and that flight in instrument weather conditions (IFR) generally requires that properly operating radio aids to navigation (of the type intended to be used on that flight) must be aboard the airplane (and that the pilot be trained and experienced in their operation). But, one additional radio aid to navigation Mr. Pickard didn\u2019t mention is radar. In the event of failure of his own navigational radios, or if a non-navigationally-equpped plane accidentally wanders into instrument weather conditions, _or_ in an intentional ground-assisted instrument approach, the pilot can rely instead on ground-based radar operators, through communications radio contact, to report to him his location, and even to guide the pilot through a landing approach in IFR conditions by giving him directions to turn, climb, or descend until the pilot can see the runway and resume visual pilotage to complete the landing.

In reality, a lot of crews used the headings on the computer-driven flight plan,cross checked with the rather difficult to manage loran C\u2026it told you where you were a few minutes ago and could not be coupled effectively with the autopilot, ( but neither could the VOR effectively,)\u2026and things worked relatively well but seperation criteria gave a lot of room between airplanes. I still remember going to San Juan from New York and you'd see another contrail going in roughly the same direction but \u201cover there\" a bit. Then you'd see a contrail crossing ahead at a 45\u2070 angle and you'd start checking your own position and wondering, \u201cwhere where the heck are they going?\u201d When Omega showed up, traffic out over the ocean soon was pretty much lined up on course and visible to you. Pretty nifty. GPS really made navigation accurate and altimeter very accurate so seperation criteria has been reduced making needed room for more traffic. ",

Before that, Doppler radar and Loran (maybe Omega?) were probably the usual for 707s and DC-8s. I\u2019m guessing that by 1970 few airline flights carried a navigator, and after 1970 very few airline flights made any use of a sextant. (Even when it started flying across oceans in the 1930s, Pan Am knew celestial navigation wasn\u2019t that great \u2014 they just planned to use it until something better came along.) ",

            "answer_text": "One of the oldest and simplest forms of navigation employed by humans is known as pilotage. Pilotage is the act of using fixed points to approximate your location. If your friend asks for directions to your house and you say turn left at the billboard and go a mile past the red house, you're giving them directions using pilotage. Similarly, early pilots often used existing features such as roads, train tracks, radio and water towers, town or just about any prominent feature, natural or man-made that you can think of. The early airmail service across the western US perfected this form of navigation going so far as to construct a series of large concrete arrows in the ground and lighthouses to guide pilots in the early days of aviation.   Concrete arrow for navigational purposes.  Light tower for navigating at night. Obviously pilotage doesn't work too well over the open ocean where everything looks the same so the science of navigating via dead reckoning was perfected for aviation with navigators keeping very precise logs of their aircraft's speed and heading to determine location.

Remember that ships used to navigate around the globe much before aviation started and they too used the first four methods.  The methods when adopted to aviation, needed a bit more involvement and understanding because of the speeds involved. Before GPS was thought of, there was another system called OMEGA navigation system which had some 9 very low frequency transmitters located at fixed positions on the ground.  The VLF frequencies travelled almost half-way around the globe and helped the ship or aircraft to estimate position and plan the next course to go over to the desired waypoint, something like the current GPS.  That system had some inherent disadvantages due to which, it is obsolete now. ",

It is still used as the most basic form of aerial navigation and taught to all primary students. It is often referred to jokingly as IFR - I follow roads/rivers/railroads.Dead reckoning - Dead is short for deduced. This is navigation based on simple algebra and trigonometry using known or forecast data such as time, speed, distance, wind direction and velocity, etc. This is the second form of navigation taught to primary students. It is used mainly in visual conditions and usually combined with pilotage, making it a very precise method when performed properly.Celestial navigation - This was commonly used for long range navigation all the way into the beginning of the jet age. Pilots and navigators took \u201cstar shots\u201d and referred to an almanac to fix their position.Radio navigation - This came in many forms from the early four course (AN) ranges, DF (later ADF), LORAN, TACAN, VOR, DME, INS, etc. Some are still in use today in conjunction with GPS.",

Most modern aircraft you fly today had no GPS receivers 30 years ago. They had to be installed at a high price. A lot has changed since then. Many VOR\u2019s are being shut down. We fly RNAV (GPS) approaches in poor weather. Small airports are getting GPS approach capability. GPS is in your smart phone, your car and almost everywhere these days. ",
