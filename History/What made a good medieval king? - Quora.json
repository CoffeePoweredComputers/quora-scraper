            "answer_text": "Mostly, it was the intelligence to delegate to smart and loyal people, and the ability to deal with other people in a friendly way, that didn\u2019t antagonize them. Kings didn\u2019t really have time to micromanage anything. Antagonizing a powerful noble family could mean a civil war, or simply get you overthrown. Some British kings were so bad at dealing with others that they simply refused to ever call Parliament (didn\u2019t end well). Others outside of England also ran into problems if they couldn\u2019t secure the active support and cooperation of their subjects. For example, the Holy Roman Empire was reduced to a shell by successive kings who simply could not garner any substantial support and loyalty from their subject kingdoms, to the point where the constituent aristocracy just paid lip service to the office for centuries, while they warred against one another, essentially ignoring the Emperor. It didn\u2019t help that the office was supposed to be elected by the aristocracy, who obviously liked to put weak people into power. There were really just a few \u201cgreat\u201d emperors (The Ottonians for example) who managed to make that huge mess orbit around them and accrue that power for their own purposes, but it generally didn\u2019t outlast them in a meaningful way until another one like them came along.
