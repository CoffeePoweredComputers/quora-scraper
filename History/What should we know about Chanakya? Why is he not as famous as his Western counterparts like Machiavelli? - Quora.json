            "answer_text": "Some facts about the great scholar Chanakya[1] -  According to many historians, Chanakya was born in 350 BCE, and he had a very manipulative nature that helped in the formation of the Maurya Dynasty \u2013 one of the largest dynasties ever known in ancient India.Being a pioneer economist and a politician, he even achieved the knowledge of astronomy and medicine.Abhidhana-chintamani of Hemachandra gives one important verse on chankya,\u0935\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0903 \u0915\u094c\u091f\u0932\u094d\u092f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0923\u0915\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u091c\u0903 \u0964 \u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0932\u0903 \u092a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0932\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924\u094b\u0921\u0919\u094d\u0917\u0941\u0932\u0936\u094d\u091a\u091a \u0938\u0903\u0964\u096e\u096b\u0969\u0964 Chanaka's son Vatsasayana, Kautilya, Mallanaga, Dramila, Pakshilaswami, Visnugupta. Upper verse gives seven different names of chanakya.[2] Brhatkathakosh of harisena give tale no. 143 on chanakya named 'chanakya-muni-kathanaka. In this version chanakya's parents were Brahmin kapil and Devil\u0101. While chanakya's wife was Yasomati. According to the Jain account, Chanakya was born to two lay Jains (shravaka) named Chanin and Chaneshvari. His birthplace was the Chanaka village in Golla vishaya (region).[3]The identity of \"Golla\" is not certain, but Hemachandra states that Chanakya was a Dramila, implying that he was a native of South India.[4]Chanakya was born with a full set of teeth. According to the monks, this was a sign that he would become a king in the future. Chanin did not want his son to become haughty, so he broke Chanakya's teeth.The monks then prophesied that the baby would go on to become a power behind the throne.[5]After he felt insulted by King Nanda, Chanakya vowed to uproot Nanda and his entire establishment, like \"a great wind uproots a tree\".[6]While wandering, he did a favor for the pregnant daughter of a village chief, on the condition that her child would belong to him. Chandragupta was born to this lady.After Chandragupta grew up, Chanakya saw him playing \"king\" among a group of boys. To test him, Chanakya asked him for a donation. The boy told Chanakya to take the cows nearby, declaring that nobody would disobey his order. This display of power convinced Chanakya that Chandragupta was the one worthy of being a king.[7]And then there was the start of the great Mauryan empire.According to a popular legend mentioned in the Jain texts, Chanakya used to add small doses of poison to the food eaten by Emperor Chandragupta Maurya in order to make him immune to the poisoning attempts by the enemies.Unaware, Chandragupta once fed some of his food to his queen, Durdhara, who was seven days away from delivery. The queen, not immune to the poison, collapsed and died within a few minutes.In order to save the heir to the throne, Chanakya cut the queen's belly open and extracted the fetus just as she died. The baby was named Bindusara, because he was touched by a drop (bindu) of blood having poison.There are many legends which state that Chanakya actually maintained an army of females. These women were known as Vishakanyas.The girls were given poison until they reached puberty, and then they were used for secret assassination missions.Chanakya\u2019s views on women were may considered wise in ancient times, but in today\u2019s world they are obnoxious :According to him, women are not trustworthy, for they have a corrupt and vile nature.[8]According to him, a woman can attain purity only if she drinks the water that has been used for cleansing or washing the feet of her husband. She can never attain such purity by drinking holy water or observing fasts or even offering charity.Chanakya\u2019s thoughts on \u201cideal\u201d wife were not complimentary as well.[9]According to one legend, Chanakya retired to the jungle and starved himself to death.According to another legend mentioned by the Jain writer Hemachandra, Chanakya died as a result of a conspiracy by Subandhu, one of Bindusara's ministers.Subandhu, who did not like Chanakya, told Bindusara that Chanakya was responsible for the murder of his mother. Bindusara asked the nurses, who confirmed the story of his birth. Bindusara was horrified and enraged.When Chanakya, who was an old man by this time, learned that the King was angry with him, he decided to end his life. In accordance with the Jain tradition, he decided to starve himself to death.By this time, the King had found out the full story: Chanakya was not directly responsible for his mother's death, which was an accident. He asked Subandhu to convince Chanakya to give up his plan to kill himself. However, Subandhu, pretending to conduct a ceremony for Chanakya, burned Chanakya alive. Now the second part! Why isn\u2019t Chanakya as famous as his Western counterparts like Machiavelli? Chanakya is perhaps lesser known in world history compared to later political philosophers like Sun-Tzu and Niccol\u00f2 di Bernardo dei Machiavelli, but is definitely considered as the first genuine political theorist in Indian history. The very apt reason would be the ages when both were born and influences they have in the today\u2019s world. Chanakya was born around 2300 years ago, while Machiavelli was born around 550 years ago. This suggests that Chanakya\u2019s works Arthashastra and Chanakya Niti, also known as Chanakya Neeti-shastra, were not transported among the world at that period of time till today. Chanakya\u2019s work was limited to Indian civilization only.  While Machiavelli[10] is the only political thinker whose name has come into common use for designating a kind of politics, which exists and will continue to exist independently of his influence, a politics guided exclusively by considerations of expediency, which uses all means, fair or foul, iron or poison, for achieving its ends\u2014its end being the aggrandizement of one's country or fatherland\u2014but also using the fatherland in the service of the self-aggrandizement of the politician or statesman or one's party. If we compare both of them in terms of work, then no doubt Machiavelli is well known, as : Arthashastra and neeti shastra are the two known works of Chanakya.While works of Machiavelli are well spread from politics to fictional writings to history :The Prince.Discourse of Livy.Discorso sopra le cose di Pisa (1499)Del modo di trattare i popoli della Valdichiana ribellati (1502)Descrizione del modo tenuto dal Duca Valentino nello ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, il Signor Pagolo e il duca di Gravina Orsini (1502) \u2026and many more. Modern materialist philosophy developed in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, starting in the generations after Machiavelli. This philosophy tended to be republican, more in the original spirit of Machiavelli, but as with the Catholic authors Machiavelli's realism and encouragement of using innovation to try to control one's own fortune were more accepted than his emphasis upon war and politics. Not only was innovative economics and politics a result, but also modern science, leading some commentators to say that the 18th century enlightenment involved a \"humanitarian\" moderating of Machiavellianism.[11] Machiavelli indeed had a huge impact on the modern world. Machiavelli's ideas had a profound impact on political leaders throughout the modern west, helped by the new technology of the printing press hence describe his immense popularity. Major philosophers, such as Montaigne, Descartes, Hobbes, Locke, and Montesquieu were highly influenced by his work. The 20th-century Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci drew great inspiration from Machiavelli's writings on ethics, morals, and how they relate to the State and revolution in his writings on Passive Revolution, and how a society can be manipulated by controlling popular notions of morality. No doubt Machiavelli is more famous as he indeed has a stronger impact than Chanakya in today\u2019s world of politics!

            "answer_text": "Most of the answers are incomplete, and focused only on who was Chanakya, and gave unsatisfactory information about why he was not as famous as Machiavelli. Gunjan B. Yadav satisfactorily explained the first part but was incomplete in her second part. Answer to the first part:( The bread and butter things) Chanakya, who? : He was the advisor in the times of Chandragupta Maurya. During those times, it is unclear if Kautilya was a teacher, or a court manager. (Gowen, 1929) But it is clear that Kautilya educated Chandragupta in his early days and remained his mentor in the times of his reign. He was his key advisor on numerous aspects like war,fight,enemy, statecraft. This claim is often cited on 2 broad contours. Firstly, During Alexander invasion, He advised Chandragupta and killed the Greek Generals. Secondly, His policy on number of horses,standing army to be maintained was strict. The placement of the king would be decided on the basis of Army, population, wealth. (Sarkar, 1919). Moreover, Kautilya believed in the principle of expansion of territory and killing all immediate enemy in order to save the kingdom. Kautilya was astute, unethical but constantly strived for betterment of his people and expansion of the King Chandragupta. (Boesche, 2003)And further mentored Asoka. But he, however, chose the path of Dhamma and become a Buddhist after Kalinga war. (source: Aman Khanna on The Academic Blog)  Now answering the main question, why wasn\u2019t he as famous as Machiavelli. He was discovered late. As simple as it sounds.It was rediscovered in 1905 by R. Shamasastry, who published it in 1909. The first English translation was published in 1915. Hence it didn\u2019t reach the west until 20th century. On the other hand, \u201cThe Prince\u201d by Machiavelli was in hard copy in 1532 CE.Yes, Arthashastra was an ancient text written in 2 century BCE but only got reinvigorated by Shamasastry.He wasn\u2019t there in the Indian Foreign Services(IFS) curriculum in 2000,[1] and was only added somewhere around 2010. Better late than never.Eurocentric bias: This is a technical term which means all the foreign policy doctrines and international affairs are centred around in terms of European or Anglo-American values and experiences.Many research followed Machiavellian work. Yes, Machiavellian is a work but \u201cChanakyan\u201d or \u201cKautilyan\u201d isn\u2019t a word.So, there you have it.Indians only recently took Chanakya in their research papers.It is high time that Chanakya, who was ignored for many centuries, is given the recognition he rightly deserves.
