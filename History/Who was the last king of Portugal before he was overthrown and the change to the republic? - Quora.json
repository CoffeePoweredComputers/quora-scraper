On that day, while travelling in an open carriage across a Lisbon square, the royal family were attacked by two assassins. The king, Carlos I died instantly and crown prince Luis Filipe was mortally wounded.  A depiction of the regicide One of the reasons that have been given for the assassination was Carlos\u2019s interventions in Portuguese politics in the years leading up to 1908. This led Manuel II to declare that he would exclusively reign as a constitutional monarch and that he would not actively be involved in governing his realm. He tried to increase the monarchy\u2019s popularity by travelling around the country extensively. The young monarch was reasonably popular among the Portuguese people and the Portuguese Republican Party got only 9% of the vote at the August 1910 legislative elections, with the rest of the votes going to parties that had monarchist inclinations. However, those election results wouldn't really matter, because the Republicans had already decided beforehand that they would be taking control by force. On the morning of the 3rd of October 1910, after the murder of a prominent Republican, some elements of the Portuguese army and navy mutinied and took up arms against the government. While the government forces initially outnumbered the rebels ~7000 to ~2000, the mutinous sailors had taken control of three cruisers that lay at anchor in the Tagus.  NRP Adamastor, one of the cruisers taken over by the rebels The rebels now being able to bombard the city with impunity and a general reluctance of government troops to suppress the rebellion by force greatly reduced the government\u2019s effective fighting force. The king was forced to flee the city with the royal family and the next day, October 5th, left the country on the royal yacht to go into exile. On that same day, the Republicans, having succeeded at their coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, proclaimed the republic from the balcony of Lisbon City Hall.  The proclamation of the republic Manuel II lived out the rest of his live in exile. While there were several attempts to restore the monarchy by force, the former king insisted that he would only return if the people of Portugal had voted on it in a referendum. He died on the 2nd of July 1932 in his residence in London of suffocation by an abnormal swelling in the vocal folds of his larynx. He was 42 years of age.  The former king on the day of his death ",
