            "answer_text": "Answer simple! They all born as Muslims because they belong to Muslim parents. Since they born as Muslims, as they grow they are obliged to offer compulsory prayers and follow certain way in their lifestyle. They do that just because they are compelled. As they grow, they get used to it so much that, missing even a one time prayer a days starts hurting them, created a discom to their life. As they grow further, they will learn more about their prayer and now they start feeling kind of pleasure being religious and offering their prayers. Their day will be active if they get up early and start the day with early morning prayer. If they face any problem, they know that's temporary and the a life without death is hereafter. If they got deceived and could get justice, they know they will get justice in the court of Allah. Every difficulty is a test from Allah. Now you tell me, what more you wanted to be religious? When being religious gives them more happiness why not they opt to be so. Sync Islam ",

            "answer_text": "In the past, mainly medieval time, Islam and Christendom used to fight over themes or border cities and fortresses. The last two centuries witnessed something that didn\u2019t happen before; Western countries collaborated _either consciously or unconsciously_ in attacking and dividing the whole Islamic world. The heartland of Islam was _and still_ attacked viciously. This culminated in the abolishment of the Ottoman Caliphate. Nonetheless, attack is still ongoing. So the land of the Turks was divided to seven new countries, Arabian Peninsula to six countries, Levant to four, Al-Maghreb (i.e. North Africa) to six, and Egypt reduced significantly. And this state was told by Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) 1300 years before it happened. He said : \u201cThe nations are about to call each other and set upon you, just as the diners set upon food.\u201d It was said, \u2018Will it be because of our small number that day?\u2019 He said, \u201cRather, on that day you will be many, but you will be like foam, like the foam on the ocean. And Allah will remove the fear of you from the hearts of your enemies and will throw wahn (weakness) into your hearts.\u201d Someone said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah! What is wahn?\u2019 He said, \u201cLove of the world and hatred for death.\u201d [Source : Abu Daud (no. 4297), Ibn \u2019Asaakir in Taareekh Dimashq (2/97/8) and others This hadith explains the first form of weakness, which has befallen the Muslims in all corners of the world, as being a result of inclination to this world, love of it, and being pre-occupied with it, whilst turning away from the Hereafter, being distant from it and hatred for death. Hatred for death is a sign of loving this world, since the one who loves this world, hates death. Whereas the one who loves the Hereafter, loves death. Since, with death, comes the meeting with Allah the Most Perfect. Anyway, after the division Muslims started to realize the huge gap in science between the East and the West. They began to ask themselves; what went wrong? Many theories surfaced some of them urged people to follow democracy others to follow Capitalism, others to catch up with military innovations..etc but they all failed. And Muslims started feeling humiliated, so they tried to come up with some sort of resistance. The Arab League,for example, was one of them, it failed catastrophically as it appealed to nationalism between new nations who were recently one nation in essence. Then Western attacks became more blunt and obvious. Everyone in the Islamic world started to see that Arnold Toynbee was right, and the West is just a beautiful facade, with lots and lots of underlying problems. And not only the West, but all the Non-Muslim countries like the Soviet Union. We realized that we left a beautiful and perfect way of government and conduct, to pursue crippling and devious ways. The dichotomy between the Eastern and Western Camps ended in the fall of the Soviet Union, which was done by Muslims primarily and by CIA and MI6 partly. The invasion of Afghanistan proved to be costly, and the same thing with Chechenya. Both countries are Muslims, an the fighters \u201cMujahideen\u201d were natives and Muslims from the Arab world as well. During the last two centuries, Muslims fought against the odds in many wars, if not all. We found solace in religion, and discovered that we win only when we apply God\u2019s rules and commandments. Unfortunately, Media all over the world portray us as devils, terrorists and Misogynists. And generalizing the acts done by a few, painting the whole Muslim populations with a single brush stroke. You must understand that we support Jihad. And Jihad means struggle; struggle against oppression and occupation. We need to convey the message of Islam to the whole world. Again, not force people to convert or die, but to indicate to them that Islam is not what they were taught! So Muslims started to learn their religion the best way they can. It helps us to defeat the monstrous doctrines of ISIS and people like them. But to have a clear picture, if ISIS didn\u2019t kill captives, or enslave people or kill innocent population in Muslim and Western cities, we would have gladly supported them in their fight against US and European troops in Muslim lands. there are many hadiths that urge us to be closer to God, and be more religious : The Prophet (PBUH) said : \u201cWhen you enter into `Enah transactions, take hold of the tails of cattle, and are content with farming, and you forsake Jihad , Allah will cause humiliation to prevail over you and will not withdraw it until you return to your religion.\u201d(Source : Abu Daud, hadith no. 3464) ",
