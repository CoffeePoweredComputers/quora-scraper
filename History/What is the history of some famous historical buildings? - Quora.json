            "answer_text": "Le Louvre One of my favorite buildings, Le Louvre is known to have the most extensive collection of art in the world, attracting many tourists each year to marvel at the works inside and architecture outside. Here are some facts.  When the now famous Pyramid opened, many Parisians and French hated it as it stood in stark contrast to the Baroque buildings. Ironically, the pyramid is actually the least intrusive design chosen, specifically designed to minimize the blocking of the building behind it and with see through glass specially made to be translucent. 2. The palace is built ontop of old fortifications. Le Louvre was built by Phillip II to protect Paris from the English and Normans. Earliest signs of a fort go back to the viking raids on Paris.  3. There used to be a whole palace at the end of Le Louvre called the Tuilleries Palace. This was the preferred living quarters of Louis XVI and Napoleon during their residency in Le Louvre. It sadly burned down in 1871, being set on fire by the Paris Commune. This image above shows a rendering of what it would look like today, closing the East courtyards and blocking the view from the Centre of Le Louvre from seeing the Arc de Triomphe. The Tuilleries Jardins now sit on the site. Edit: The burning of the Tuilleries is a great loss in my opinion, as the rooms were some of the most opulent in the palace, ever surpassing Versailles as it was the most modern royal residence until burning down.

            "answer_text": "Due to cost cutting measures during construction, Citibank Building in Manhattan was found to be structurally unsound. Construction crews worked around the clock to fix it, but Hurricane Hell was on her way and would\u2019ve easy knocked over the building on to the New York Financial district. As a side note, is on four columns. And there was an old Lutheran Church on the property. The church allowed the building to be demolished if it was rebuilt and none of the columns could go through it. At the last minute Ellas veered off and saved the day. Now I\u2019m not saying the hurricane necessarily moved because of the church, but I understand. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup_Center#Engineering_crisis_of_1978 ",
