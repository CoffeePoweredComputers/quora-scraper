            "answer_text": "Descartes and Malebranche. In Discourse On Method, Descartes talks about freeing himself from past influences but in actuality he hardly does that. His borrows freely from the past and his philosophy is just scholastic philosophy molded in a geometrical order via his theory of Ideas and nothing else new. He came up with the absurd idea that we can prove the existence on God just on the basis of having an idea of God; his natural light of reason reveals to him exactly those metaphysical principles (many inspired by Ockham and Suarez) which would allow him to deduce the existence of God. Unlike scholastic philosophers he never justifies those principles but is cocksure about them because his natural light of reason cannot betray him. If you are indebted to past philosophers why not just accept the debt why the show of being innovative and of being cleansed of the past. Malebranche followed Descartes in being a highly dogmatic philosopher just like him. To anyone dissenting with his views his usual way to counter them is saying that they are enamored of what senses reveal them and ignore the light of reason found in eternal Ideas that are perceived in God. But are there any ideas? Malebranche says anyone in his right mind can never doubt that there are Ideas; eternal specimens that he locates in God. Uncharitable to opponents; specially to Foucher he was forced to acknowledge that existence of the world cannot be established but would hardly give the credit to Foucher for showing him his mistake; worst he continued to deride him.
