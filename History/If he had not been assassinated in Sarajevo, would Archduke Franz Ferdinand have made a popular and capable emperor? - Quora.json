            "answer_text": "I already answered much of this question. Would Francis Ferdinand's plans to reorganise Austria-Hungary have worked, or would he have ended up being Austria-Hungary's Gorbachev? Franz Ferdinand was quite capable and he had already shown this by trying to mediate between Czechs and German speakers..  The Biggest Problem would be to tackle Hungary. Most pressing was the Transsylvanian problem as some sort of autonomy AND rights for the Transsylvanian Romanians, Uniate and Greek Orthodox alike was strictly necessary. Both the Hungarian bigwigs and the Romanians knew this as his death was mourned in Transsylvania but less in Hungary proper.  The Lesser Problem would be to cut the ties between Croatia-Slavonia with Hungary and promote Croatia to a junior partner in Austria-Hungary-Croatia. If Hungary retained the port of Fiume/Rijeka with a railroad it could be done. And the Croatians would enjoy a fusion with Austrian Dalmatia of which 75 % was Croatian and Bosnia-Herzegowina with a Croatian minority..  The one but biggest problem would be the Czechs. Franz Ferdinand had the benefit of a Czech wife so he might become as popular as Emperor Ferdinand had been.  Enhancing the Autonomy of Austrian Galicia and Austrian Bukovina would not be that much of a problem. Actually some German speaking Austrians had lobbyed for the exclusion of Dalmatia, Galicia and the Bukovina from Austria to obtain a majority.. Yet i do not think much more was even possible and not all plans of Popovici could be realized.  Oddly enough during his lifetime Franz Ferdinand was mainly popular among minorities, especially Croatians and Transsylvanian Romanians who showed it. But after his death Franz Ferdinand was greatly mourned all over the Dual Empire, least in Hungary proper. Thus the Serbians and the French started to sketch him as a warmonger, which is a big fat lie!  No doubt his wife, Duchess Sophie of Hohenberg had a good influence on him and would try to form his harsh personality into a more popular one. ",

            "answer_text": "Franz Ferdinand was very popular among the minority ethnic groups of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He realized that the greatest problem facing the dual monarchy was that it consisted of about a dozen different ethnic groups, of which only two, the Germans and the Hungarians (who together accounted for about 44% of the total population), wielded any power or control. Also, the favoritism shown to the Hungarians in 1867 caused discontent on the part of other ethnic groups such as the Czechs and the Romanians. Franz Ferdinand surrounded himself with a group of scholars whose goal was to replace the anachronistic feudal empire with a federation of ethnically and linguistically dominated semi-autonomous \"states\" (based on the ethnic composition of the empire). Under this plan, language and cultural identification was encouraged, and the disproportionate balance of power would be corrected. This plan was set to encounter heavy opposition from the Hungarian part of the empire.  ",
