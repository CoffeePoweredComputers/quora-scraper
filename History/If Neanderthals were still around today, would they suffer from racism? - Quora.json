            "answer_text": "You have to be careful about terms. If Neanderthals had remained a subspecies instead of absorbing into the general species then they would in fact be a distinct race in a biologically meaningful way. If by \u201cracism\u201d you mean treating some groups as inferior in moral worth, or with lesser civil rights, or to be driven off or killed, then it would be no more justified with Neanderthals than with modern races today. But if \u201cracism\u201d means treating groups differently based on actual characteristics, racism would be justified for Neanderthals. There could be good reasons for things like different drinking ages or insurance rates or education policy. There would be no reason to want equal outcomes or equal representation in all fields. A lot of modern racism is based on treating socially-defined human races as biological subpopulations. There is too much similarity among modern humans, too much recent interbreeding for that to make sense, and the social categories are not optimal biological classifications. But if you had a genuine subpopulation, those types of racist attitudes would be reasonable. As a practical matter, I think Neanderthals would face a relatively benign form of discrimination. They had more robust bodies and would likely excel at sports involving strength and coordination. They had bigger brains, but they were less devoted to social reasoning than physical. As a result you would expect them to live in small groups in challenging physical environments. They would likely be admired for their toughness, independence and physical skills; but thought uncultured and rough. I\u2019d also expect the Neanderthals to manifest racism against modern humans. At the risk of being accused of racism myself, I might compare it to the way lowland English people used to think of highland Scots; or Spanish and French people thought of Basques. You would expect a lot of conflict, but not the sort of genocidal hatred the worst racists evidence. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you serious? Have you seen what our species does to EACH OTHER?  Anti-Semitism (The Holocaust)  Race based slavery (American Slavery)  Ethnic or tribal based genocide (Rwandian Genocide) Homo Sapiens have shown no gripe about exterminating or discriminating against other Homo Sapiens for things that don\u2019t matter like skin color, language, ethnic group, religion etc. Humans have fears of people who aren\u2019t like them which is why humans have persecuted minority groups who aren\u2019t exactly like them. They\u2019re a \u201cother\u201d and people in their primal feelings feel aversion and distrust, especially as groupthink affects them. Neanderthals would be outright slaves in some instances and the argument would be \u201cThey\u2019re not a part of our species\u201d but yes. Homo Sapiens would enslave, try to exterminate, and even rape homo Neanderthals if they existed with us long enough in history. Would we as a modern society treat them with respect ? I would hope as they are still humans just not our species of human. But you can bet that there would be people who view them as innately inferior, that is for sure. ",
