            "answer_text": "#Endsars protest in Nigeria may lead to unexpected outcomes. This protest have been initiated several times since 2017. All of those times, the government would swing into action, banning sars only for the same sars militia to surface again after few weeks and start killing again. But on 8th october, 2020, the youths staged another sars protest, as usual, the government swings into action, banning sars and promising to reform the police force. But the youths are not taking it this time. We don't trust the government, our government. Protest continued. Just as predicted, few days later the Inspector general of police anouced a new outfit to replace Sars. But the youths are not taking it. We have realised that we actually wanted a better Nigeria. Impunity is the canckerworm that have eaten deep into the system. Sars have been ended, but the protest have just began to grow. More millions of youths are coming out. The protest have spread all over the country. It is not stoping anytime soon. As it stands, young people have realised that we all want the same thing - a better Nigeria. We have no idea where we are headed with this protest but revolution is just one of the possible destination. ",

            "answer_text": "Revolution any where in the world as alway been stirred by either political, social or economic injustice. In some cases it's not plan at the initial stage ,it erupts. Though I do not yet see a Revolution out of the #endsard protest, this would be determine by government responds and protesters strength of will and focus. Historically, many revolutions have involved civil wars. Such great revolutions as the English Revolution of 1640 \u2013 1660 , French Revolution of 1789, the American Civil War of the Angolan civil war of 1974 - 1991 , to a large extent are civil wars that later morphed into revolutions. Beyond the ends sars ,police brutality protest ,my desire would be to see these movement a means to an end and that end will be 2023. ",
