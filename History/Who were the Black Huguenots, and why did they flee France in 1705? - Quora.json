But black Huguenots? I\u2019ve never heard of them. And why would they migrate to a territory where black people were generally slaves, & those who were free suffered legal discrimination? That was what they were trying to escape when they left France. ",

            "answer_text": "I have to say first hand that I have extreme doubts about Black Huguenots. Not because they are Blacks, but because they are Huguenots. The edict of Nantes having been removed in 1685, the only remaining stronghold of Protestantism (beyond Alsace, where the protestants were not prosecuted) were the mountainous regions of Southern France, where the presence of Blacks was beyond unlikely.
