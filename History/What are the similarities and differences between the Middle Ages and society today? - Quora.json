With no artificial light medieval life would of been governed more by night and day than you, and you live in far more luxury, but you'd be surprised how little the excence of life has changed. They'd of discussed weather like you, moaned like you, laughed like you, even with all those vegetables ( meat was for the wealthy) broke wind and laughed like you. The exsense of humans hasn't changed. A medieval person would of been far more insular and ignorent of affairs and the outside world, but not necessarily a bad thing. Life would of been hard, short and sweet and possibly not as violent as some might say. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you have any idea how long it would take to cover this subject? It would need a very large book. Just from the point of view of Britain and Europe, the Middle Ages covered the period from the fall of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, ie: 5th - 15th centuries. That\u2019s 1000 years. To put that in perspective, it\u2019s only been 500 years since the Renaissance. Pick a more specific timeframe, and maybe a constructive answer might be feasible. ",
