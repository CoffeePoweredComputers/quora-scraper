            "answer_text": "Considering the changing nature of the global economy, driven by technological advancements and globalization, it is now more important than ever to invest in human capital and ensure that everyone has the skills necessary to succeed. According to recent estimates, up to 2 billion of today\u2019s jobs are at risk of being replaced by automation by 2030. The UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report and the Education Commission\u2019s Learning Generation Report provide important evidence on the impact of education on individual\u2019s earnings and economic growth. Below are some of the most compelling data that illustrate these links. 1.Education reduces poverty 171 million people could be lifted out of extreme poverty if all children left school with basic reading skills. That\u2019s equivalent to a 12% drop in the world total.Absolute poverty could be reduced by 30% from learning improvements outlined by the Education Commission.2.Education increases individual earnings Education increases earnings by roughly 10% per each additional year of schooling.For each $1 invested in an additional year of schooling earnings increase by $5 in low-income countries and $2.5 in lower-middle income countries.3.Education reduces economic inequalities If workers from poor and rich backgrounds received the same education, disparity between the two in working poverty could decrease by 39%.4.Education promotes economic growth Educational attainment explains about half of the difference in growth rates between East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa between 1965 and 2010.In 2050, GDP per capita in low-income countries would be almost 70% lower than it would be if all children were learning.Increasing tertiary attainment by one year on average would increase sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s long-term GDP by 16%.5. Education helps save the planet* *What does that have to do with poverty? Hear us out\u2026 Overall climate change and the resulting increased frequency of natural disasters and reduced agricultural output could cast as many as 122 million people into poverty by 2030.The creation of green industries will rely on high-skilled, educated workers.Agriculture contributes 1/3 of all greenhouse gas emissions. Primary and secondary education can provide future farmers with critical knowledge about sustainability challenges in agriculture.By : Ernest Tetteh",

            "answer_text": "Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. And Education equality which is also known as educational equity is the study and achievement of fairness, justice, and impartiality(Equality) in education. The term equity means accomplishing and meeting the specific needs of specific individuals. This means ensuring that everyone's learning needs are met. Educational equity is based on the principles of fairness in distributing, resources, opportunities, treatment, and success for every student. Educational equality can decrease poverty by the following, Education can help fight inequality. Before giving people more opportunities to participate in society, we need to address some specific obstacles to participation. Often the most vulnerable communities aren\u2019t recognized as equals in their community. As a result, they lack representation, power, and status. But, at an individual level, education is a basic human right for all. One of the biggest inequalities that perpetuate the cycle of poverty is gender. When gender inequality in the classroom is addressed, this has a ripple effect on the way women are treated in their communities. When girls are welcomed into the classroom, they can build skills, gain knowledge, and socially grow during their formative years. This establishes a foundation for lifelong learning. And also education can also combat the underlying structures of poverty. Increased access to education can contribute to reducing poverty. Acquired basic skills such as reading, writing, and numeracy, have a documented positive effect on marginalized populations\u2019 incomes. It increases the rate of return on the economy. A newly published paper by UNESCO shows that education is critical to escape chronic poverty and to prevent the transmission of poverty between generations. The rate of return is higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. Primary education has a higher rate of return than secondary education. Education also enables those in paid formal employment to earn higher wages: One year of education is associated with a 10% increase in wages. Education also changes structures in food security. A study from 1980 that still is influential, analyzed the effects of primary education on agricultural production in 13 countries. It found that the average annual gain in production associated with four years of schooling was 8.7% (Lockheed, Jamison, and Lau, 1980). Education becomes a catalytic force contributing to the turn of the tide of eliminating extreme poverty \u2013 in a sustainable way. with all these said I think educational equality can decrease poverty.
