            "answer_text": "The Battle of the Bulge 1965 was a totally fanciful movie. It condensed the story. Even Eisenhower denounced it. It used Cold War US tanks to depict Tiger II Tanks and Sherman tanks. It was filmed in Spain. So it was missing the snow & trees. If I were the copyright holder I would CGI the right tanks, snow and trees. The worst part is they showed the Stg44 but didn't fire it. That's an atrocity!     ",
