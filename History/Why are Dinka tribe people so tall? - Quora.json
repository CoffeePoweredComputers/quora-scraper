            "answer_text": "Well, the question seems to have an answer in itself, as it takes for granted that the Dinka is the tallest tribe. Nevetheless, I do not agree with that. The Watusi tribe, a branch of the T\u00fatsi people, who lives in Rwanda, are considered since a long time ago, the tallest people on EARTH. As far as I know, Watusi men had an average height of 1,95 m and women had 1,78 m. These measures were taken a long time ago, perhaps in the beginning of the 20th century. I do not know the situation today, but probably we can say they managed to maintain their stature. The region in which they live was colonized by the Dutch who surely know a lot about them. I hope I have helped. Greetings. October 21, 2019. ",
