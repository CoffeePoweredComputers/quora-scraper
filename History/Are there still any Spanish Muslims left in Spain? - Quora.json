            "answer_text": "Of course! I\u2019m not sure I understand what prompted that question, but I\u2019ll try to elaborate: When Spain was \u2018reconquered\u2019 the new, catholic rulers did not kick out or eradicate every single muslim. It stands to reason that some families stayed for the long run, and you can see evidence of that in some people\u2019s heritage (though I would argue they rarely remained muslim due to the very long standing resentment against them way back then, and of course, there was some mingling with non-muslims too). Also, we have two autonomic communities that are in Africa, bordering with Morrocco (if you look at a map, they look like they\u2019re inside it). There\u2019re lots of muslims there, not to mention we have quite a bit of inmigration from northern Africa, where the religion is fairly widespread. Lastly, I would point out that their stay here forms a rich part of our heritage and culture (even if not as prevalent as our catholic roots). As a bit of a fun fact in that regard, the famous \u2018Spanish\u2019 guitar was invented by muslims! EDIT: I should also note that there are spanish muslims, obviously (and when I say spanish here, I\u2019m referring to the stereotypical caucasian/latino folk here). I know it\u2019s redundant to point out that religion is not a matter of race, but since back in the day most muslims were moors and most catholics spanish, I can see how my answer could make it sound like there is a distinction between the two.

While there are many descendants of those who chose to convert and stay they are not muslims anymore. Currently a bit over above 4% of the population of Spain is Muslim, almost 2,000,000 people, of which 40% hold Spanish citizenship, either by birth or naturalisation. Most of them are either immigrants from Muslim countries or their descendants born in Spain, though something over 20,000 are Spaniards who have converted to Islam. Islam in Spain - Wikipedia ",

The Spanish crown brutally supresed the rebelion, make the survivors full slaves and decreed their deportation from Spain between 1609 and 1616. Some regions of Spain lost up to one third of the population! That is one of the reasons there are so little north african and middle eastern genes in the modern spainsh population. There is a proposal to reinstate Spanish citiezenship to the descendants of those expelled. They often to have arab names with spanish surnames. But even is Spain today they are many arab surnames of arab origin like Almeida, Almodovar. ",
