Both Antoninus Pius and Septimius Severus ordered Roman campaigns into the Scottish highlands, but they were never able to subjugate the region\u2019s native Picts and Caledonians enough to have \u201cconquered\u201d it. They eventually stopped trying as there was really no point. Hadrian\u2019s Wall, the border between Roman-held Britain and uncontrolled territory (there is debate on the purpose of its construction) Persia. Marcus Crassus failed, Trajan succeeded in conquering Mesopotamia and Armenia but Hadrian decided to abandon the territories instead, and campaigns over the next couple centuries were usually never ones aimed at conquest. Roman legionaries being shot by hundreds of Persian arrows during the Battle of Carrhae Germania. The Romans were actually doing a decent job after Tiberius had led Roman legions to the Elbe in 6 CE, but Augustus had to pull 8 out of 11 legions out of Germania to deal with an Illyrian revolt, so Varus only had three legions to defend against Arminius\u2019 uprising, and that resulted in total annihilation of all the Roman forces at Teutoburg. The destruction of Varus\u2019 legions in the Teutoburg Forest These are the only three major examples that I can think of. Rome didn\u2019t expand without purpose, and they didn\u2019t see much purpose in occupying lands far beyond the Danube or Elbe Rivers, Africa, or Mesopotamia, as they were much less valuable than their already subjugated Mediterranean lands.

            "answer_text": "The Roman Empire was essentially an empire of the Mediterranean, and the Romans actually the Mediterranean Mare Nostrum, which means \"Our Sea.\" This boast has stood the test of time, as no other empire has ever managed to conquer the entire coast of the Med. The only long-term territory controlled by the Romans that was completely removed from the Med was England; otherwise, the Romans pretty much conquered the Med coast and some of the areas bordering those coastal territories. Wikipedia has a whole series of articles dedicated to areas with limited Roman presence. Most of the info below is from reading those articles. In the Northwest, the British launched a few campaigns to conquer Scotland, but they never quite got around to completely conquering the territory. It seems like they at least thought about conquering Ireland, but never got around to it. Rome doesn't seem to have seen any particular value in Scotland itself, but it was interested in ending raids from Pict tribes of the area. In the North, the German tribes presented one of the two great rivals of the Roman Empire. Early in the history of the Roman Empire, the empire appeared to have attempted to conquer present-day Germany and establish a long-term presence there. This ended in disaster for the Romans at the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest. However, it's not totally clear if the Romans were attempting to fully colonize the area, or simply trying to  In Eastern Europe, the Romans under Marcus Aurelius launched the Marcomannic Wars in an attempt to extend Roman control in modern Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. Aurelius's death brought these wars to a halt. In Africa (outside of East Africa), it appears that the Sahara limited the Southern expansion of the Roman Empire. The Romans did face raids from nomads, but allied with (and later conquered) the Garamantes. It doesn't seem like there was much remaining land worth conquering. In Northeast Africa, Rome went to war a few times with the people who inhabit what's now known as Sudan. Rome's Southern neighbors would often raid Egypt, while Rome would conduct punitive expeditions in retribution. Nero also sent an exploratory expedition that some think reached Lake Victoria; it may have been intended to be a prelude to an invasion. Whatever the case, Rome never got around to conquering the area, though they did trade quite a lot with the area. In Arabia, the Romans successfully conquered a province they called Arabia Petraea, which consisted only of Northwest Arabia. The Romans also found a loyal ally in the Ghassanids, who acted as a buffer against he nomadic tribes of the Arabian Desert. The Romans organized at least one expedition to Arabia Felix (Yemen) which, then and now, was a more populated area than most of the rest of Arabia. However, Rome doesn't seem to have ever attempted to have conquered all of the Arabian Peninsula. Finally, in the East, Rome clashed with the one empire on its borders: first the Parthians, and later their successors, the Sassanids (both empires are so). The two sides often clashed over Armenia and other territories near the Black Sea, with Armenia being a vassal state either of both empires or of the more powerful empire. Rome sacked their rivals' capital, Ctesiphon (near modern Baghdad), several times over the course of many wars. At the height of Roman power, Rome was able to annex modern Iraq and other territories. However, Rome was never able to fully defeat either empire, and the two sides clashed with each other for centuries.    A map of the Parthian Empire ",
