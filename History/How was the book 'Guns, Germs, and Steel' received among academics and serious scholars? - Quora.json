Those bespectacled, mild-mannered milksops are in actuality stern and rapacious when it comes to critiquing others\u2019 works. So take their condemnation with a good deal of salt. In general, anything that challenges the mainstream is in for a good lashing. And to be frank, Diamond\u2019s heady array of hypotheses and evidence is large but rather tenuous. Scholars can tell instantly that it\u2019s not aimed at them. Most scholars seem to have found it either simplistic or downright fraudulent. Some have been more measured. In Diamond\u2019s case, there is an additional layer of irritation that he ventured out of his narrow specialty and into the fields of history, sociology, and anthropology. Specialists don\u2019t like being poached. One writer described it as \u201cacademic porn\u201d. Real History versus Guns Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond A more thorough and reasonable review is here: Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not an academic and sure \u2018aint no scholar but I do dabble\u2026 Guns, Germs & Steel is one of my favorite books of all time. It\u2019s fairly dense but certainly readable but the astounding thing is, like only a few other authors I\u2019ve read, Diamond takes a mammoth & multidimensional topic and breaks it down into a few very understandable concepts. I mean if I asked you why did Western Civilization flourish and develop all this technology & come to dominate the world, how do you answer that? So many factors, interconnected, so many different paths to explore, so many disparate fields of science & history that all contribute to the answer. Personally, I\u2019d recommend it to anyone interested in learning a bit about the world and how we all came to be where we are today. Granted, in today\u2019s environment, many of the factors Diamond explores in his book are no longer as relavant because we are now truly a global society, interconnected by trade, commerce and communications BUT it is still a very important (in my opinion) book that really sheds light on our collective history.
