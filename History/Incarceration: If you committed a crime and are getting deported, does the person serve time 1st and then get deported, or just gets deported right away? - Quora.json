            "answer_text": "That's an interesting question. You would think \u201cWhy waste money on people that will get deported?\u201d It would be too easy. Someone commits a crime and the worst that can happen to him/her is getting deported.  In fact you have to do all your time (in federal it\u2019s at least 85% of your sentence) and get deported. It usually means they transfer you to an immigration prison (or county jail) to wait for the deportation procedures. In fact non-Americans do usually even more time than Americans because they can\u2019t get some programs like the drug program that subtracts one year on your sentence. They can\u2019t go in a halfway house etc. Prisons for non-Americans (private facilites) also have less services for inmates. And as a non-American they can incarcerate you anywhere, they don\u2019t care about where lives your family. Instead of paying 6 cents a minute for local calls we were paying 30 cents. When you get paid 12 cents/hour it means you have to work 2.5 hours to talk one minute on the phone. When you\u2019re an American you can work for the Industry (Unicor) and get time credit plus a good amount of money. You can have emails etc.  But some people get deported and come back. Coming back after being deported is a federal offense and I\u2019ve seen people do 5 years for that. 5 years because you wanted to come back to your family. That\u2019s hard. EDIT: I'm lucky because I'm from Canada and was living in Canada. I met so many people who would get deported with all their family living in the USA. For Christmas we would get a big bag of candy and junk and the week after I could see a lot of grown men send that big bag to their family. That was the only thing they could afford to give to their children for Christmas. They had to save for months just to pay for postage. I learned that even if I had a lot of problems, I'm still privileged. ",

            "answer_text": "In general they serve the time first and then get deported. However, there can be exceptions. Lucky Luciano, an organized crime figure, was deported in 1946 prior to serving out his full sentence. This was a reward for providing allegedly valuable information to assist the Allies during World War II. The deal wasn\u2019t entirely to Luciano\u2019s liking, as he wanted to stay in the US, but at least it got him out of prison. In the only plea bargain I\u2019ve seen involving possible deportation, the prison component of the sentence was to be served before deportation, but the probation component of the sentence would come after deportation. Remember that probation, when part of the sentence, is a key part of any sentence. The sentence was for three years of prison followed by two years of probation. The probation, if served in the USA, would have involved a lengthy list of conditions. However, if deported, the person would still technically be on probation, but there would be no conditions except having to remain outside the USA. So the person did essentially get a free pass on most of their probation conditions by being deported. ",
