            "answer_text": "This is quite a broad question but I will also give a broad answer: Knowing history allows a Filipino to understand the present of his country. Through reading historical records, eyewitness accounts and examining historical studies as well as visiting museums and historical sites, one may have a broad perspective why the Philippines is in its present state. Another source of history would be the newspapers, periodicals and magazines which contain a wealth of historical information. There are also books made by various authors which maybe used as a guide. For foreigners, knowing the history of the Philippines is an excellent way of understanding the people and their customs. History also allows them to know the origin of the people, their culture and way of life. By understanding history they will know that the Filipinos are a diverse people with a rich historical and cultural heritage. By knowing history, people can plan for the future and contemplate on what steps to take. As to the quality of history one must learn, it should be free of hagiographies, myths and fabrications. My advice is to ask where the history came from; is the source reliable or does it conceal an ulterior motive. There is no such thing such as objective history as everyone has his own biases. But history that is grounded on sources especially the primary ones should be read. And the next step is critically analyzing the information and interpreting it. The proper interpretation of history allows the person a sense of perspective, see the potentials and threats and prepare himself and his community for the future. ",
