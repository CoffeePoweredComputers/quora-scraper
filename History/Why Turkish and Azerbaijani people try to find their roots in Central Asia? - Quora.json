            "answer_text": "If it is true that there are Turkish and Azerbaijanis who do this, then it is perhaps because they originated from that region in the first place. The original Turks were first recorded in Sui-Tang Chinese history as the \u7a81\u53a5\u3002They were mixed but mostly East Asian. They spoke East Asian languages related to Mongolian, Korean, and North Chinese languages. They were from around the Altai-Mongolia-China region. And over time they became friends and allies with the Tang Chinese. After the Tang, many migrated into the west, forming the Seljuq and Mamluk empires, mixing more with the local populations. Then the Mongols came and once again Turks and East Asians belonged to the same country. After the Mongols, Ottomans entered Anatolia Turkey and mixed more with the natives. Over time, the Turks may have lost some of their original Eastern appearance, but not their language or genetics, which they still carry with them today. Turks nowadays have between 15\u201380% East Asian DNA, and as East Asia once again becomes the pre-eminent world power with the rise of countries like China, more Turks want to return to their more eastern roots. After all, the country Turkey imports the most from is China. Some Anatolian Turks are entranced by East Asian culture or even things like Kpop. Central Asian Turks are also collaborating more with East Asia on a renewed Belt and Road Initiative. Turkey (TUR) Exports, Imports, and Trade Partners During the Mongol Empire, this was the Silk Road that connected East and West. And more Turks want to be part of that former glorious golden age. It was partly because of the Mongols and Chinese, that the Turkic people and languages spread across the western world. The Turks are one of the people that stand to benefit the most from a renewed Silk Road and cooperation with China and East Asia. And this is why the western world including the USA is trying to spread so much lies and propaganda to interfere with stronger Turkic-East Asian ties. Just see how the USA backstabbed Turkey in the Syrian war or on matters relating to the Armenians; or how the EU rejected Turkey\u2019s entry. Now more Turkish people are seeking to develop stronger ties with the East, whether in Russia, China, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "I have found that some Turkish people, who perhaps lack an in depth knowledge of the history of Ancient Turks, fill in the blanks by themselves. For example, my father was Kirgiz. Consequently, I have more of a Central Asian look than the rest of my family. Recently, I was actually told by another Turk, that I looked like the Oghuz Turks. I did not respond, as I quickly realized that they were simply misusing the term \u201cOghuz\u201d. They were using it as a catch all phrase to mean original Turks. And, they had wrongly assumed that the Turks of Turkey were descended from Central Asians. I happen to be, by direct lineage. But, this is very different from the implied meaning in what he said. I don\u2019t mean to disparage people in Turkey who may have a more simple and general understanding of their roots. For the sake of fairness, a lot of what is now known is fairly recent discovery and would not have been part of the education of anyone over a certain age, unless it occurred at the University level. For centuries, Central Asia was known to Turks as Turkistan, literally meaning the \u201cland of the Turks\u201d. It is only natural, that unless it was actually studied in an academic setting, the presumption would be that Anatolian Turks came from Central Asians. This is the very same misunderstanding held by a majority of people the world over. What we know now - Turkic people are originally a West Asian people. Some migrated Eastward in and around the Bronze age and came into contact with East Asians. Over centuries, they admixed with these East Asians, but retained their original culture and language. Some may have migrated Westward thereafter. But, genetic studies done on the oldest found remains of Turkic people indicate a purely West Asian race with Caucasoid features. The Oghuz Turks, specifically do not seem to have taken part in that initial Eastern migration and maintained their original features. Other groups who initially migrated Westward though, were affected by Mongolians who later raided and entered their Western lands. This is most evident in the Kazakhs, and other Tatar groups who fell under the rule of Berke Han in the 13th century. As you can see, this can become confusing. The confusion is exacerbated by the fact that ALL these people somehow maintained a Turkic identity and language throughout all these centuries and across huge swaths of land. So Turkic people are extremely mixed racially, and acquired the DNA of those they mixed with. But the Oghuz Turks did not descend from the Eastern Turkic people. All these different groups descended from the same West Asian people, and acquired different characteristics based on their geography. I think at this point in history, the best examples of the original people can be found among some Oghuz Turks who avoided mixture. Specifically, the Oghuz who still maintain the same centuries old traditional, semi-nomadic life, and the Gaughaz who evaded the Mongols, Arabs, and Persians, and settled in the Balkans without ever entering Anatolia or Central Asia.
