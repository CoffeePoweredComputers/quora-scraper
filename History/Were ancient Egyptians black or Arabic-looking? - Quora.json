            "answer_text": "Ancient Egyptians came in two flavors those of the Southern/Old kingdom Dynasties were black resembling Nubians and Those of the North/New Kingdom Dynasties resembling Ancient Negroes therefore when these 2 kingdoms were united Egypt/Kemet or Mizrahim ran the full spectrum of Black and Negro skin tones from the darkest of black skin tones to the lightest of the Red-Brown=Reddish Brown skin tones of the Ancient Egyptians and Ancient Negroes. The Ancient Egyptians and Ancient Negros also may have looked like the Dark Arabs that originally populated the North Mediterranean coasts of Africa as far as Eithiopia and southward which became markedly phenotypically different from the Arabs of Eurasia evolving into the Tan/Brown/Olive complexions of north Africa and the Euro and Indo-European complexions associated with Eurasia=Middle East and that inhabit the North African Mediterranean regions of today Haplogroup A s the founding haplogroup of the entire Human race- It was founded in Africa and the skin color was black. (In as far as there was melanin content ) mainly eumelanin as opposed to pheomelanin. There is also neuromelonin, Eumelanin is what constitutes for brown pigments. Dark hair, brown eyes, tan or black skin. That\u2019s the expression of eumelanin, and probably the type of melanin you are most familiar with. Pheomelanin is what constitutes pink pigments. Red hair, light eyes, pasty and red-hued skin is the expression of a higher presence of pheomelanin. This is more common in people of Caucasian descent. *The above content was cited from a Quora article: Do White people have Melanin? wrotten by \nAaron Endelman, S.B., Physics, MIT, 1979. Because of the climate we can be certain that the original man (Adam) Haplogroup A Expressed the Dominant D Eumelanin trait as opposed to the Recessive R Pheomelanin trait\u2026 We know that the Pheomelanin male and female parents cannot produce offspring that is of a Eumelanin pigment\u2026(Two White Complexion/European-Indo European/*Caucasian-(Erroneous racial Term)- parents cannot produce a black child) This is why their will always be Two extremes of skin colors for human 100% Eumelanin expression or 100% Pheomelanin expression and all the other skin colors represented between these two extremes ie.. Black and White Note: Albinism= An aberration occurring in humans and other vertebrates, albinism is an absence of pigment in the eyes, skin, hair, scales, or feathers caused by a genetic defect. All forms of melanin hold their own advantages and disadvantages, which makes sense considering people adapted to their environments to ensure survival. We must also be cognizant that humans migrated out of Africa and colonized the world and adapted to their environments while doing so, as such also developing mutations or expressing other traits that helped them to adapt to their environments such as the production of Vitamin D particularly advantageous in Northern/Cold climates\u2026.remembering also it is the development of specific Mutations that eventually distinguish Haplogroups from each other Externally and also Unique Mutations that Classify, distinguish and identify the subclades within an individual Haplogroup best Exemplified by Haplogroup E via E1B1A & E1B1B Particularly in E1B1B where there is a pronounced division of subclades due to genetic mutation concerning adaptive/climatic Pheomelanin expression in a subclade of E1b1bb so that you have European looking descendants and Sub-Saharan looking descendants in the same subclade\u2026 E1b1b Negroes and *E1b1b German/Ashkenazi Jews. * Note this challenges and destroys those that advocate the Eurasian back migration theories which are based on the assertion that lighter skin complexions of Europeans/Indo-Europeans/, Arabic/Syrians- *Globally Eurasians migrated into north Africa when the truth is that Africa especially north Africa Produced light skinned Eumelanin pigments that simultaneously migrated and mutated out of Africa thus triggering genetic and adaptive/climatic Pheomelanin expression\u2026.meaning as Y-Dna Haplogroup subclade t\\moved out of Africa and mated with non Eumelanin carriers the lighter each generation of descendants became until they acquired the ancestral phenotype traits of the women they mated with and the genetic mutations and climatic adaptations that sustained those phenotypes. Thus Haplogroups A, B, C, DE- D, and E all originated in their ancient expression as Eumelanin phenotypes in Continental Africa So while they remained in Africa- and exclusively mated with women of the MtDna L Haplogroups in the continental African plate, they and their descendants maintained their Eumelanin expression and where black skinned generally lighter in the northern most Levantine/Natufian region growing darker as they infiltrated continental Africa westward and southward Note Africans were also ligt skinned in response to climate as well so South Africa had Light skinned Africans as well like the San people. Indigenous Africans carrying the Classic Dark Black African Phenotype today belong to Haplogroups A, B\u2026but Haplogroup C became what we consider Native Americans, and those that colonized current day Canada, North and South America via going through China, Russia and Alaska land root this haplogroup is a founder of Haplogroup Q\u2026.Haplogroup D and Haplogroup E founded the Asians and the Negroes Haplogroup DE is the Founder/Parental Haplogroup of E and D0 The authors support an African origin for DE (parent haplogroup of E) with E and D0 also originating in Africa, along with the migration out of Africa of the three lineages (C, D and FT) that now form the vast majority of non-African Y chromosomes. * Note that D migrated out of Africa via Eurasia and eventually became The Modern Asian populations Steppe and Eskimos. So the A\u2019s, B\u2019s and E\u2019s stayed in Africa the C\u2019s D\u2019s and F\u2019s moved out of Africa also mutating, adapting to their environments and mating with other humanoids picking up and assimilating Neaderthal and Denisovan and Humanoid X genetic mutations and variants Note Sub Saharan DNA is the Purest of all Human DNA, therefore the purest or most uncontaminated admixture content of all Human DNA is found among Sub Saharan Africans/Negroes. Negroes were scientifically described as medium brown to black in complexion but biblically described as Red/Brown Reddish-Brown in complexion so the skin tones of an Ancient Egyptian and an Ancient Negro-Haplogroup E especially the subclades of E1B1A were very much the same and were very distinct from the Ancient Nubian skin-tone more representative of Haplogroups A\u2019s and B\u2019s biblically Arabs are Negroes who originated as black\u2014brown but have mutated and adapted to be more tan than brown- Giving the Mediterranean phenotype even looking more European and Indo-European just as the E1B1B\u2019s do and for the same reasons The modern Arab Haplogroup is Haplogroup J which came from the DE split Haplogroup D= Afro Asian and Haplogroup E=Negroe Therefore J should genetically have inherited markers from D it\u2019s parent and also should have inherited common markers from DE -it\u2019s Afro Genetic Grandparent. So nearly out of Africa the Arabs would most likely develop the Mediterranean phenotype and completely out of Africa in Eurasia most likely develop the Erroneously characterized Caucasian/European/Indo European phenotype rather than maintain it\u2019s half African-maternal/half Negro phenotype The latest scientific studies are confirming that the Ancient Egyptians were black descended from Haplogroup B. With complexion differences in the inhabitants of the Northern and Southern Kingdoms the North looked like Negroes and the South looked liked Nubians thus the Arabs began to look like Hittites/Indo Europeans/Europeans also Ancient *Horites it simply became to hot for fair skin to stay in Africa due to their lack of eumelanin they were highly susceptible to skin cancer and like Arabs today who are not black they must completely cover their body from head to toe in order to protect against the sun, and the word Kemet means Land of the blacks (Cham-Et) Cham Km=black and Et =Land - KmEt= Black Land, (This is where the erroneous soil reference is derived) but the tru etymology of Kemet is as follows Kemet etymology Origin of the word Kemet. In the pre-history period of Egypt, and during the Old Kingdom, Egypt was referred to as Kemet, or simply Kmt, which means \"The Black Nation\" or \"The Black City\". The name for Egypt was originated by the Greeks, as Ae-gyp-t-os\u2026. Kemet was not refering to the color of the soil but a reference to the color of the inhabitants of the city/Nation and South of it=Egypt you have the Sudan= The word Sudan means country of the blacks\u2026so where is the soil reference there? So it is highly unlikely that Egypt was called Kemet in antiquity for the color of the black soil along the Nile but instead was named after the skin color of it\u2019s inhabitants just as Aethiopia=Ethiopia and Niger all describe territories where black people inhabited/lived in antiquity by their skin color sometimes globally encompassing all of Africa where all of the black skin types lived who are biblically recorded as the descendants of Ham and the descendants of Shem/Semites/Negroes. Their were 2 periods in Egypt\u2019s history where the Pharoahnic Dynasties were composed of conquering *Non indigenous African rulers the *Hittites and the *Greeks respectively but again these conquerors were non indigenous Africans and therefore could not be the founders of Ancient Egypt. *Note: Currently Examining the Origins of Y-Dna Haplogroup R and if their ids an Edomite link/Origin to E1b1b that leads to the Founders of Greece so that R1b1a and E1b1b may have attempted unsuccessful back migrations into Africa why is R1b1a Slavic/Russian/Scandinavian and R1b1b Afrikan? Did the Same type of Dynamic that Created E1b1a and E1b1b phenotypes appear much earlier and created the R1b1a and R1b1b phenotypes? ",

            "answer_text": "I won't say they were black because the Greeks who studied in Egypt never used the word black. The word used was \u201cMelanchroes\u201d. That's how Herodotus, Diodorus, Strabo and other greek historians described the ancient Egyptians. Many scholars argue that the Egyptians were not black because the Greeks used a different word to describe Sudanese people. The word was \u201cAethiopes\u201d meaning \u201cof the burnt face\u201d. So the word Melanchroe only suggests that the Egyptians were a people of color. Likely dark skinned but not as black as their southern relatives who were Cushites. Today there are many Hamitic people in India, South America, and even the horn of Africa who are dark skinned but not necessarily black. According to the Bible, Ham was the father of Cush (meaning \u201cblack\u201d. He fathered the Ethiopians/Sudanese people) The second son of Ham was the brother of Cush. His name was Mizraim meaning \u201ctwo lands\u201d or \u201cdouble straits\u201d. He was the father of the Egyptians, Philistines and other North African peoples. He had a son called \u201cLybsos\u201d. The Jewish historian Josephus flavius said that the name of this son was later given to the land we call Libya. The next son was Phut and the last was cursed with slavery. His name was Canaan. Ham is \u201cChamam\u201d in Arabic and \u201cKham\u201d in hebrew. It is the root word of the ancient name of Egypt (\u201cKhemet\u201d) and Cush was called \u201cKerma\u201d. The word Khem in Egyptian means \u201cblack\u201d. In hebrew the word Ham/ Kham means \u201chot\u201d. In Arabic the word Ham/Chamam means \u201cto be burnt\u201d or \u201cto be black\". So we can be at least sure that the Egyptians were swarthy by nature with or without exposure to sunlight. But their degree of swarthyness can only be determined by melanin testing on Mummies. I read UNESCO \u201cGeneral history of Africa\u201d and Diop conducted melanin dosage tests on Mummies in France. His conclusion was that they were black. That is not definite since we know that Egyptians were related to cushites and absorbed them into the state. There was always a heavy cushite presence in Egypt. It would have been conclusive with further testing, but at the Cairo symposium, Egyptian authorities did not allow any melanin dosage tests to be conducted on other mummies. My Final take: Jer 13:23 \u201cCan the Cushite change the color of his skin\u201d? If the Egyptians were black, why was the Cushite singled out in this verse. Why were Moses and Paul mistaken for Egyptians? The blackness of Egypt can only be resolved if we acknowledge the deep cultural, ethnic and historical interconnectedness between the Egyptians and their Cushite relatives. They fought battles together. They defended cities like Thebes together. And in the Bible, they were almost always mentioned together in prophecy after prophecy. This debate lives on because we have not yet reached a consensus as to how we should define blackness. Western view: Blacks are any group of people related to the the victims of the transatlantic traffic or who share their broader phenotype i.e Wooly hair, broad nose, thick lips, enlarge buttocks e.t.c Objective view: Blacks are people who have a black skin color regardless of their facial features, or the lands to which they are indigenous.
