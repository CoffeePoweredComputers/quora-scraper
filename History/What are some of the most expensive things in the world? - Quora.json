            "answer_text": "I won't be mentioning most expensive things like Cars/Jewelry/Art works etcAll of them collectively one can find at 25 Most Expensive Things In The World what attracts me more towards this question is the additional details that have been provided, the matter of my interest, the Antimatter  Some people think antimatter could possibly fuel spaceships to the planets, and maybe the stars, in the years to come.But for now it's too bad because Antimatter costs around $63.5 trillion per gram. (figures provided by NASA in 1999)Although some authorities think it may eventually come down to mere $5 billion per gram.There is absolutely No match for this most expensive element on earth.  Since there is no match for Antimatter on earth, here is another thing though it is violating the limits of the question a bit Scientists in 2004  discovered cosmic diamond, a chunk of crystallized carbon 50 light-years from the Earth in the constellation Centaurus, \u201cSome people refer to it as \u2018Lucy\u2019 in a tribute to the Beatles song \u2018Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.\u2019\u201dNow Cost of 1 carat of pure diamond in approximately $ 20,000 ,  Lucy is 2,500 miles across and weighs 5 million trillion trillion pounds, which translates to approximately 10 Decillion carats, So Lucy's price would be about  $0.2 Duodecillion i.e. 2 followed by 38 zeros.  Coming back to earth, dealing in a considerable range-few hundred thousands to millionsGold has been a precious metal for a very long time,it is status of wealth and prosperity, our currency backed by gold , well the precious Gold is cheapest here , it is ONLY $40 per gram  Plutonium , cost roughly around  $4,000 per gram , still cheap   Tritium costs $30,000 per gram - somewhat costly  Californium 252, one pound of Californium would cost 350 billion dollars , meaning 1 gram costs about $780 million.  Botulinum Toxin - quite familiar name but it is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth.  Is it expensive ? Yes, it costs only $139 Billion per gram (as per data by BBC) Lastly, since expensive is also a relative term we must know that 1 USD was also very expensive some time ago, atleast for country like Zimbabwe, On February 2013,  $1 was equivalent to  $92,233,720,368,547,760 Zimbabwe Dollars !! , Yeah, that's right. 1 U.S. dollar gets more than 92 quadrillion Zimbabwe dollars. Zimbabwe doesn't even use its own currency anymore; it now uses U.S. dollars for everyday transactions. This is what happens when a country lets inflation(hyper inflation) happen, becoming dependent on foreign currency instead of their own. That's it.Source : Internet, BBC, Wikipedia.",
