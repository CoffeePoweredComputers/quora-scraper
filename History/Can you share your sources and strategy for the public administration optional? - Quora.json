            "answer_text": "Public Administration as a subject has seen quite the fluctuation in terms of marks allotted in mains. But for the past 3 years the results have been encouraging. Full disclaimer - This is MY strategy and it worked for me, please take what works for you and leave the rest. Its not perfect, its not the best so keep that in mind! SOURCES- My sources were very minimal, but I have read these so many times now that I have lost count. If you feel that your conceptual clarity is not reached by these sources, then please go ahead and refer books suggested by other PA toppers. Vajiram and Ravi class notes Pavan Sir\u2019s class notes Prasad and Prasad (Thinkers) Aribam (both for paper 1 and paper 2) Newspaper (The Hindu) 2nd ARC (Most Important source for paper 2) New Vishal\u2019s publication topic wise trend analysis PYQs I did purchase Mohit Bhattacharya, Rumki Basu, Arora and Goyal. But I did not read any of these , the reason being that the subject has become very dynamic and writing static, theoretical answers are not fetching marks anymore. So honestly did not find these books useful. HOW TO READ- In my humble opinion the line separating Paper 1 and Paper 2 has completely blurred. So it becomes important to interlink and integrate the preparation of both the papers. Keep the syllabus handy.This is to be done to connect topics from both papers and apply thinkers to different aspects of Indian Administration. Example- Financial Administration from Paper 1 is to be read with Financial Management from Paper 2. While understanding audits and accounts and the role of CAG, also try to read the limitations of CAG in the Indian context, thus connecting theory with practical application. (My syllabus, just a pictorial representation of its extensive usage)  2. Previous year question papers.(PYQs) Very , Very Important. Cannot stress this enough. If you learn the art of deciphering PYQs , you will figure out that many are repeated almost every year. Only the language is changed, but the intent behind the question remains the same. In such cases it is crucial that you keep your answers for these questions prepared, complete with relevant examples. Check out question 1 and 17. Both are essentially talking about the expanding scope of the discipline, only the wordings are different.   Next check out question 2 and 4, LITERALLY the same question. This is what I call \u201cfree ke marks\u201d.   3. Hot Topics There are certain topics that UPSC loves, which are sure to feature atleast one question every year. Example- Budget as a political instrument, Changing role of District collector, Police Reforms, Mary Parker Follet as a bridge thinker etc. Again analysis of PYQs becomes critical to discern such patterns. Have a look at police reforms topic, repeated almost every year barring 2 in between.  TECHNIQUE TO READ- For Administrative thought and Administrative behavior, the simplest trick would be to read the theory then the criticism. After this align it with examples from Paper 2 and the newspaper. Example- While reading Participative Management (Likert, Agyris) , apply it to decentralized admin under Local Self Governments in India. You must quote 73rd, 74th Constituitional Amendment act. Then quote Gram Swaraj Abhiyan under which each Gram Panchayat was tasked with preparing their own development plan (GPDP). Similarly while reading Urban Development, we study the issue of multiplicity of agencies. Connect this with overlapping of functions as stated by FW Riggs.  and so on and so forth\u2026. Coming to how to read 2nd ARC, as Pub Ad students it becomes imperative to read all the 15 reports separately and not just the summary. The reason I say this is because answers to almost 60\u201365% of paper 2 questions can directly be lifted from the ARC. Here have a look at the reports and tally it with the paper 2 syllabus.  I rest my case! ANSWER WRITING- According to me THE most important factor for scoring well in the subject is this. I gained my conceptual clarity only after I started taking tests and finding out my faults. Reverse Engineering is the way to go. Check out previous year topper\u2019s answer sheets. Try to figure out - Structure of answersExamples usedInterlinking of the papersDiagrams and other tips and tricks (Simple diagrammatic explanation, saves time and space, also pleasing to the eyes) Once this is done, start with answer writing and get them evaluated from some teacher you trust. Unbiased, honest feedback is important to improve the score. Another pointer to keep in mind is that the optional subject requires in depth, detailed study and hence multiple iterations are necessary. Proficiency in answer writing is also a slow, gradual process. So patience becomes the key factor. Hope this brings some clarity. Drop your queries in the comments, I will be happy to help. Cheers!
