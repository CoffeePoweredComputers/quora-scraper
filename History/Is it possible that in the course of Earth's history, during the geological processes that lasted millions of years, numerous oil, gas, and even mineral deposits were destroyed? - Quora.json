            "answer_text": "It is not only possible, it is probable that hydrocarbon reservoirs were created and destroyed. The vast majority of oil and gas deposits are marine. This is because of the abundant and diverse biota on a planet where three quarters of the surface is covered by water. Organic material that settles to ocean bottoms is preserved from oxidation by burial under sediment. As the burial depth increases, the additional pressure and heat needed for the transformation of microscopic life into oil and gas begins. Ocean basins have been altered throughout time as tectonic plates moved about the globe.  Some reservoirs were preserved, while other reservoirs were undoubtedly destroyed. Many ancient sea beds were subducted along continental margins or lifted up and eroded away. In all likelihood, oil and gas repositories were created and destroyed over the course of Earth\u2019s history since life evolved. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course! Most of the oil ever formed probably escaped to the surface as oil and gas seeps. The La Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian oil sands are examples of huge oil seeps. Most placer ore deposits (like gold deposits on TV shows where miners filter ancient river gravel for tiny flakes of gold) are formed by erosion of the original ore. With more time, the placer deposits offshore would get subducted and recycled as new crust or incorporated into the mantle. ",
