            "answer_text": "I honestly\u2026honestly\u2026can\u2019t choose one. I have different favorites and they all remain my favorites through the years and decades. And even then I have a whole slew of bands that rest on the second tier of bands I love. And even then I have individual albums (Especially For You by the Smithereens or In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, by Neutral Milk Hotel, Tea for the Tillerman, What\u2019s Goin\u2019 On by Marvin Gaye, The Best of Leonard Cohen, Marquee Moon by Television, Crazy Rhythms by the Feelies all spring to mind but that barely scratches the surface) that I put as high as if not above the albums by my favorite artists. And there are artists that only engage me a little that nevertheless have individual songs that quite literally take my breath away. And other artists that I hear and I know that I could go down the rabbit hole with them if there were only more years in life. I like music so much I still pay for it. Sometimes. I can listen to almost anything and wring some enjoyment out of it: I don\u2019t listen to music looking for an excuse to put it down. Having said that I note that most of my favorite artists are made up of men. I don\u2019t like what that says about me, but I can\u2019t deny it. I\u2019m also pretty rock/pop oriented. I have several Brazilian jazz albums which I love, but I don\u2019t even know for sure who does them off the top of my head. Someday I\u2019d like to know as much about Classical or Jazz as I do pop and rock music. In my life the bands and artists that have meant the most to me have been: Prince. The Purple One. The pint-sized Minneapolis monarch of music.  I think his greatness took a nose-dive in the 90s, but I think that was mainly because he was suddenly allowed to put out everything he did. Being limited to one album per year, as he was in the 80s, did wonders for the quality of his music. Still, I think that every album he did from 1979\u20131987 \u2014 8 albums, two of them double-sets \u2014 are brilliant. If you were listening to music in the 80s USA you did not go a HOUR without hearing music that was obviously influenced by Prince. Beyond that his lyrics were funny, bold, naughty and touched on themes most artists still don\u2019t touch; his music always strove to break down cultural barriers: it incorporated so many styles I still don\u2019t know how to categorize half of it. And Middle-eastern tinged psychedelic sixties pastiche with a synth-funk break down right in the middle? A James Brown on acid with heavy metal guitar song? Straight up rock and roll, straight ahead pop-punk , synthesized disco, jazzy singer-songwriter, Laura Nyro and JOni Mitchell and Todd Rundgren and James Brown and George Clinton? The fact that he was virtuoso on keyboards and guitar and played bass and drums too was just icing on the funky cake.BEST ALBUM : Sign o\u2019 the Times, but all of his 80s stuff is worth it. Even Batman takes risks that nobody else took before or since. The Beatles: It took a few months\u2026but slowly but surely, I got drawn in. From 20 Greatest Hits to 1962\u20131966 to buying each and every album \u2014 in order of release, I listened to their music so many times that I can\u2019t even hear it anymore. I automatically tune them out. They\u2019ve worn a literal groove in my brain and I can play them in my head, note for note. I even like Revolution 9! I was totally one of these annoying Beatles fans who relate everything to them. They put out a lot of music in a little time. Their melodies, their harmonies, the way that art and commerce blend so perfectly in their narrative, their sense of humor, the way their different tastes and styles blended so perfectly\u2026and the fact that they were all so cool all the time.Best introduction: You\u2019ll want all the albums but you can start with 1962\u20131966 and 1967\u20131970 sets. I can\u2019t even choose a \u201cbest album\u201d Split Enz. Not only Split Enz. But all their various offshoots and associate solo acts: The Swingers, Tim Finn, Crowded House, Neil Finn, the Finn Brothers, Schnell Fenster. Oh, man. This was a rabbit hole that I fell down and I\u2019m still trying to get out. Do you know how long it took me to track down the albums of this obscure New Zealand band in America in the mid-ninties? SIX YEARS. I combed every used record store in North America!!! This was pre-Amazon days, folks. I had to settle for a hand-me-down cassette of Time and Tide, their best album! The thrill of the hunt makes you love a band all the more.This weird-ass prog rock group that morphs into a brother-fronted arty New Wave arty pop/rockgroup which morps into these other groups, which morph into\u2026Whatever. Best introduction: Spellbound by Split Enz is a good two disc set. Together Alone by Crowded House is my favorite album of 1993. I seriously think that Neil Finn is one of the greatest songwriters of our time: his relative obscurity, at least in the northern hemisphere, his relegation to one- or two-hit wonder status, is criminal. And his brother Tim Finn\u2019s music is almost just as good, particularly in the last twenty years and the first ten years. (He did go through a rough spot in the late 80s and nineties.) If you like first-rate songcraft or harmonies this is the music for you. And it\u2019s a little known fact that in the early nineties, Crowded House were the BEST LIVE ACT on planet Earth. The Clash. I think ultimately what makes the Clash so great for me is that they, like the Beatles, always seemed to fire on all four cylinders at all times. I always feel like they are all trying so hard, yet all together. If there was a tragedy in 80s music it was the break up of the Strummer-Jones partnership. As good as they were without each other (and they were) they were always so much better together. You shouldn\u2019t fuck with chemistry like that. Watch any of their youtube live clips: they are absolutely electrifying. But it\u2019s the songs they made: and their sense of arty experimentation that really set them apart from a lot of other R&B based bands (as they turned out, eventually, to kind of be.) R.E.M \u2014 to me R.E.M. in their 1981\u20131992 heyday represent a stream of Americana that I think has mostly vanished from the USA. I don\u2019t think any band of the 80s has as consistent a song-writing catalogue as these guys: they were pretty much came out of the gate with great songs. With R.E.M., you had the mid-sixties and the best of seventies rock and punk coming together to make a beautiful art-rock that was catchy and fun yet had a depth and drive to it.  They were also, within the context of their subculture, just as important and influential and just as good as the Beatles themselves, with all four members contibuting to an important, integrated, tight whole. And if they ended up getting old and not really half as cool as they were, well, it happens to the best of us. I have waxed eloquently about them else where.Best album: anything from 1981-1992, but Murmur will always be my favorite. The Beach Boys Here is the band that defies all conventions. The Beach Boys are a mess of contradiction: popular/underground, happy/sad, with a complex narrative that changes, depending on who is telling the story, they are an example of a band who simply never was able to balance the twin engines of commerce and artistry. Always too commercial or too arty, swinging back and forth violently between the poles from album to album and even song to song, The Beach Boys are both the greatest band and the worst band; no band ever reached such pinnacles of the eternal sublime, only to fall into the latrine of artistic bankruptcy they fell into in the late seventies. Despite the great music, they made the worst, most non-sensical business decisions any major artist has ever made, leaving dozens of their best songs unreleased for decades while releasing tracks that, frankly, suck, cultivating a bad, confrontational relationship with their record companies and veering right when they should have veered left. They\u2019re their own worst enemies. In the words of their 71\u201374 manager Jack Reilly, who managed their early seventies critical reconnaisance, only to bail out when the circus got too crazy: : \u201cTo sum it up, they blew it, they blew it consistently, they continue to blow it, it is tragic and this pathological problem caused The Beach Boys' greatest music to be so underrated by the general public.\u201dBut for all that they made great records, and that\u2019s all that matters to me.Best album: anything from 1964\u20131973, but skip the first live album, and the Christmas album. Perhaps Sounds of Summer and Warmth of the Sun companion collections are the best place to start. The first one is the big hits, the second includes many of the minor hits and arty strokes of genius.  Bob Dylan: Oh, man, how I worshipped Bob Dylan in college! Is there any subject he hasn\u2019t touched on? Is he not the Shakespeare of songwriting? Does he not single-handedly define American culture? Well, your mileage my vary. Suffice it to say he meant a lot to me. Best album: I think Blood on the Tracks is a good place to start; but anything he did in the sixties is great, and most of the stuff he did afterwards, too.  Beyond all this I have several groups that I put on a tier just a little below the above artists: The Cure, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, The Kinks, George Michael, Elvis Costello, Patti Smith, The Soft Boys/Robyn Hitchcock,Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Willie Nelson, Elvis Presley, the first 1980\u20131993 era U2\u2026the list goes on and on.

            "answer_text": "Chris cornell has been and always will be my favorite artist.   His distinct voice, mysterious vibe, and amazing songwriting abilities are unrivaled in a opinion. He also has a fairly large vocal range and knew how to use it. On top of that? He was a great guy, a family man, and a man of charity. Not a mention the fact that he was becoming popular/ well know in the mid to late 80\u2019s so basically he is one of the men responsible for sparking the Seattle scene & the grunge movement. If not for Chris, bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and even some alternative bands like Rage Against the Machine may not have existed or at least they may have sounded different. Sadly Cornell passed away this year on May 18th 2017\u2026 Chris you'll always be my favorite rest in peace If I had to list another Artist I'd pick Jack Johnson he's also an amazing guy (however he's totally different from the artists listed above)  Jack is more of a folky-surf music kind of sound. It's very chill, and usually contains deep meaning in his lyrics. Not to mention Jack does EVERYTHING he can to save the environment. His own. House is insulated with old blue jeans & I'm sure his house is environmentally friendly in many other ways. Whenever he tours, they do the best they can to use bio-diesel to reduce the carbon footprint. On top of that? Most or all of Jack's merchandise (vinyl record sleeves, tshirts, etc\u2026.) Are made from recycled materials. On top of ALL THAT?! The man donates a HUGE percent of his profit from his music to charity for children, the environment, and I'm sure many more things. Oh yea he's a good man alright There's alot more I can say however, I think it'd be best if you just looked into the artists yourself I promise you both artists are amazing. Edit: sorry for the lousy screenshots at the top didn't have time to edit them ",
