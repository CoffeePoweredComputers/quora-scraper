            "answer_text": "Were cowboys really gay? Some undoubtedly were. But probably only as much as the average 5%. It however depends a little on if you actually chose to be a cowboy or if you became a cowboy because your father was one. If the first there may have been slightly less gay people amongst cowboys than in the general population because of the above average discrimination against homosexuals in that job. If the second the percentage will have been pretty much exactly the same as in the global population. You must understand that there always have been 5% of the population who were gay, no matter when, no matter where, no matter the circumstances. It\u2019s just that up to the second half of the 20th century gay people were socially isolated, imprisoned, mutilated or executed if their homosexuality had been known. Therefore pretty much all of them were in the closet. That does not mean that there were no gay people, just that they had to hide their homosexuality. This is why some conservative people think that there suddenly are more gay people since you don\u2019t go to prison for being gay anymore and humankind will go extinct for sure now because everyone will turn gay. That\u2019s of cause moronic. The apparent percentage of gay people will only rise to the real percentage of gay people when we remove all discrimination against homosexuals from society. That includes gay people amongst cowboys by the way, although cowboys will most likely become an endangered species. In the future, if we can afford to eat meat at all, it will most likely come from the lab. Cheaper, cleaner, more ecological and easier to produce in high quantities. No need for giant herds of animals and with that for cowboys. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Were cowboys really gay? Of course they were\u2026and still are. As other answers have noted, roughly 5% of the population is strictly gay (Their sexual preference is within their own gender) It\u2019s easy to assume that another 10\u201315% are bisexual or will engage in same sex couplings if or when the situations present themselves. Those people often don\u2019t consider themselves to be \u201cgay\u201d; they simply resort to logical fallacies to prevent their activities from creating cognitive dissonance. Since cowboys would be away from built-up areas for weeks and months at a time, it\u2019s likely that while a minority were gay, there were also some who were \u201csituationally gay.\u201d By that I mean that they engaged in consensual sexual acts with other men (there were very few women on cattle drives or who worked as cowhands in the Old West) when the opportunity presented itself. Given the religious and social stigmas that homosexuality engendered at the time, these assignations were performed discreetly and their \u201cpractitioners\u201d were unlikely to brag about their activities. Any setting where same genders predominate, there are going to be gay people. Not just statistically, but because the attraction of such environments would nave its appeal to people who are gay. That includes militaries, abbeys, sports teams, etc. And, of course, it would include livestock handling and care roles in remote areas. Like cowboys. ",
