            "answer_text": "Top 10 Reasons why Education is Extremely Important 1. For a happy and stable life If you want to lead a happy life and enjoy the good things the world has to offer, you certainly need to get educated. A great job, a good social reputation are few of the many benefits of being an educated person. Education is a must for a promising and secure future and a stable life. 2. Money An educated person has more chances of landing up a good high paying job. Everybody wants a good life but the good life!. It may be called as the \u201croot of all evil\u201d but most people will agree that money is important for survival in today\u2019s world. The more educated you are, the better career options you have! 3. Equality If we want to see the world as a just and fair place where everyone is given equal opportunities, education is what we require. Education is a must if we want to do away with the existing differences between different social classes and genders. It opens a whole world of opportunities for the poor so that they may have an equal shot at well paying jobs. Education also plays a major role in women empowerment 4. Makes you self dependent Education is very important if you want to be a self dependent person. It helps you become financially independent but that is not all. Education also makes you wiser so that you can make your own decisions 5. Turns your dreams into reality What is your dream, your aim in life? Do you want to become rich? Do you want to be popular? Do you want to be an extremely successful person who is respected by people? Well, the key to all this is education. Of course there are exceptions, like sportsmen who don\u2019t really owe their success to their education. However in most cases, your degree is what helps you realize all your dreams. 6. Makes the world a safer and more peaceful place Education majorly affects our understanding of the difference between right and wrong. An educated person is well aware of the consequences of wrong/illegal actions and he is less likely to get influenced and do something which is not legally/morally right. Also, a number of uneducated people who live a poverty stricken life owning to lack of opportunities often turn to illegal ways such as theft and robbery to solve their problems. If you are educated, you are well aware of your rights, the law and your responsibilities towards the society. Hence, education is an important factor which contributes in social harmony and peace. 7. Makes you confident Your educational degree is considered as a proof of your knowledge by many. If you are educated you have more chances of being heard and taken seriously. Generally, an uneducated man will find it harder to express his views and opinions owning to lack of confidence. Even if he does so, people may not take him seriously. Education gives you the confidence to express your views and opinions. 8. Society We all live in a society which has its own set spoken/unspoken rules and one of them is education. The society expects you to go to school followed by college, get a job, settle down etc. In fact education helps you become a useful member of the society. An educated member certainly has a greater chance to contribute to his community. Education helps you become an active member of the society and participate in the ongoing changes and developments. 9. For economic growth of the nation Australia, USA and Japan are few countries with very high literacy rates. These countries are extremely prosperous and the citizens have a high per capita income. On the other hand, in underdeveloped and developing nations, where literacy rate is not as high, a number of people are still living below the poverty line. Education is vital for the economic prosperity of a nation! 10. Saves you from being fooled/cheated Education saves you from being exploited and fooled. We live in a country where we enjoy a number of rights and freedom. It is easier to take advantage of innocent and illiterate people. They may be trapped into signing false documents or be deprived of some right which they have because unlike an educated person they are not well aware of their rights and freedoms. ",

            "answer_text": "Education is indeed the route to more options in life, but let\u2019s be clear\u2014schooling is very rarely education. Here in the US, we are so far from offering a quality education to young people, we\u2019d be better off to shutter the schools. And that\u2019s not just financially better off but educationally too. We need an overhaul. ",
