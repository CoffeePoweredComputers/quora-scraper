            "answer_text": "Amateurs study tactics, armchair generals study strategy, professionals study logistics The problem with this question is that the basic answer is not just \u201cNone of them\u201d but \u201cWunderaffe are almost entirely about prioritising tactics over logistics and thus are fundamentally on the wrong path\u201d. Further the Nazis were in serious trouble in any war that wasn\u2019t won early because a big part of their ideology and reason for going to war, fighting for Lebensraum and to not let \u201cinferior people\u201d have their place, was inimical to good use of logistics. The very concept of a \u201cWunderwaffe\u201d or \u201cWonder Weapon\u201d is an idea that says that \u201cThis one thing will win the war\u201d. If we look at almost all the game changers that weren\u2019t simple iterations only one was an answer to what would win the war rather than an answer to the question \u201cHow can we work better together\u201d. That one, the only one that actually fit the Wunderwaffen model was something the Nazis didn\u2019t take seriously, in large part because it was based on \u201cJewish Science\u201d and the Jews were people the Nazis had no place for and actively tried to exterminate.  The Trinity test of the Manhattan Project - an actual Wonder Weapon / Public Domain On a sidenote if Germany had still been fighting seriously in August 1945 then at least one and probably both of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs would have been dropped on Germany. Wunderwaffen would have ended the war. I can think of a lot of projects and inventions that had a significant impact on the war - but almost all of them were answers to the question \u201cHow can we work together better\u201d. Wunderwaffe on the other hand answer the question \u201cWhat\u2019s the one magic bullet that will prove our superiority?\u201d And a magic bullet being expensive is a feature and not a bug if it\u2019s about proving superiority. For that matter being hard to maintain demonstrates it\u2019s complex - and makes people follow the Sunk Costs Fallacy; if they were the best and this is complex they wouldn\u2019t have authorised that nonsense. If we look at the actual game-changing technologies in the war they are almost all answers to the question \u201chow can we work together better\u201d - or better logistics.  \u201cFreeman\u2019s Folly\u201d - the wooden de Haviland Mosquito / Public Domain To illustrate the difference between an actually effective weapon and a Wunderwaffen we can compare the way the best engineers in Britain and Germany designed vehicles in the war would deliver about 1000kg of bombs to the other country fast enough to bypass most of the air defences. Representing Britain\u2019s engineers \"Freeman's Folly\u201d, the \u201cWooden Wonder\u201d, the \u201cTimber Terror\u201d, the de Havilland Mosquito (specifically the MkIV bomber) while representing the German Wunderwaffen was one of the few that actually got deployed and a precursor of the spacerace - the V-2 rocket. Cost: The Mosquito was literally made of wood and cost about 1/10 of a B-17 Flying Fortress. The V-2 cost as much as a high performance fighter - and the V-1 and V-2 project cost 50% more than the Manhattan Project. Advantage: MosquitoRange: Mk IV Mosquito: 3,780km. V-2: 320km. Advantage: Mosquito.Top Speed: Mosquito: 380mph. V-2: 3580mph. Advantage: V-2Payload: V-2: 1000kg (2200lbs). MK IV Mosquito: 4*500lb bombs or occasionally a less generally useful specialist variant carrying a 4000lb \u201cblockbuster\u201d bomb. Advantage: MosquitoAccuracy: Mosquito: WWII bomber, complete with Mk1 eyeballs to check if it hit its target. V-2: British counter-intelligence convinced Germany they were undershooting London by 10 miles so they retargeted 10 miles North. When they tried using the V-2 tactically to blow up a bridge actually in Germany 11 V-2s all missed, with misses ranging from 500 yards to 40 miles. Advantage: MosquitoSurvivability: The Mosquito was one of the safest bombers of the war - in large part because it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world when introduced, remained one of the fastest planes, and if it had to deal with a jet fighter, had a very low stall speed. Meanwhile the V-2 was on a one way trip - and is estimated to have killed more people building it than in the explosions where it hit. Advantage: Mosquito.What their enemies thought:\u201c... those of us who were seriously engaged in the war were very grateful to Wernher von Braun. \u2026 From our point of view, the V-2 program was almost as good as if Hitler had adopted a policy of unilateral disarmament.\u201d - Freeman Dyson\u201cIt makes me furious when I see the Mosquito. I turn green and yellow with envy. The British, who can afford aluminium better than we can, knock together a beautiful wooden aircraft that every piano factory over there is building, and they give it a speed which they have now increased yet again. What do you make of that? There is nothing the British do not have. They have the geniuses and we have the nincompoops.\u201d - Herman GoringWhich would you rather have had on your side in a war? The tactical answer to the question \u201cHow can we reliably penetrate the enemy air defences, no matter the cost?\u201d or the logistical answer to the question \u201cAluminium is a strategic resource? How good a plane can we make that uses wood instead?\u201d  The impact of a single V-2. Not seen: Any military benefit / Public Domain Other Wunderwaffe were no better, prioritising tactics over strategy. The 188t Panzer VIII Maus might have the rear armour a Tiger II had from the front but it wasn\u2019t going anywhere (or at least not without a ludicrous amount of fuel the Germans didn\u2019t have and not over any bridges). The \u201cwaterfall design\u201d of the Type XXI submarine would have solved a whole lot of tactical issues if it had been seaworthy - but as more than 95% of of the ones the Germans built weren\u2019t the only logistical issues it solved were \u201cHow can the allies destroy over 100 U-Boats for no losses and never even firing a shot?\u201d Even if they\u2019d worked sonar and depth charges already existed; they\u2019d have been a serious headache but weren\u2019t unbeatable. Probably best was the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter which was actually introduced in April 1944 and wasn\u2019t enough to save Germany - especially not with German fuel shortages. It wasn\u2019t even enough for Britain to bring the Gloster Meteor jet fighter, introduced two months later, out to play over the skies of Germany. Instead Britain used the Meteor to shoot down V-1 flying bombs, practice jet and anti-jet tactics, and occasionally to fly over allied territory and give the German jets a very nasty surprise.  Gloster Meteor being deployed in 1945 - not needed over Germany / Public Domain For war-changing and country saving projects we should look at the winning side and I\u2019m going to point out three (other than the actual Wonder Weapon - the Manhattan Project). The Russian T-34. As a tank actually designed in WWII the T-34 was, one on one, very mediocre by the standards of wartime designs although it made all pre-war designs (German, Russian, and British alike) obsolete and in need of refitting at a minimum. But despite major shortcomings the T-34 was good enough even for the late war, and unlike the German tanks it was pretty reliable. It also allowed really effective use of Russia\u2019s industry. It was a logistical triumph.The British Dowding System was the huge breakthrough. The Germans had Radar - but how do you get the intel from Radar into the hands of the pilots who need to use it? A system to first integrate the information provided by multiple Radar stations and the Royal Observer Corps and turning it into first a map and then something that could be sent to the pilots defending from the Luftwaffe. It\u2019s not flashy - but it means that the existing defensive airforce could be used much more effectively so the fighters always had a numerical advantage. Another triumph of logistics.Bletchley Park - the largely British codebreaking camp based on the back of Polish work. Being able to read your enemy\u2019s communications is huge. It\u2019s not a Wunderwaffe because it\u2019s not an actual weapon and of itself gets no one killed. But, even if you are concealing it and need plausible deniability, it is a massive game changer.I could have gone into more, especially to do with American industrial production, Liberty Ships, setting up a production line more than a mile long to build heavy bombers, and more. But that\u2019s all boring logistics - and it\u2019s a lot more fun for amateurs to study tactics. Logistically the Nazis were screwed, in large part because they were Nazis and enabling everyone to contribute and get the best information no matter their background was pretty much the opposite of what they were about.

            "answer_text": "None single one\u2026 but the existing technology of 1944 and 1945 in extreme large amounts with enough oil, supplies etc. would have made a huge difference, peace with the western allies and fighting against the soviets and their few allies (Mongolia etc?!), the areas they occupied (UK allowed that they occupy northern persia and create a land route south of the caspian sea from azerbaijan via persia to turkmenistan and use oil fields in this area, also it was the route for 30% of all goods send to the soviets, its just hard even in theory because of Japan and their war against western allies colonies, the US and China\u2026 but yea the soviets were lucky to get exactly what they needed, for germany that would have been for example fuel, special materials like wolfram to produce special anti-tank ammo with even higher penetration, engines and a motorized logistic, safe production at the \u201cHome front\u201d and not bombed day and night, as Eisenhower already said by 1941 \u201cWe will support the side which is losing, this means we support Russia at all costs\u2026\u201d (no exact quote, just the sense\u2026), many experts really were scared that the soviet defense could collapse and already by september first stuff which only started days after the invasion from Britain reached Murmansk port, with aircraft and UK pilots to train soviet pilots in these fighters (the best the UK had at this time, many more would come), also they flew missions to protect murmansk harbour which was the most important one for goods, especially in that early phase, Russians like to play down the role of allied support, yes they were bleeding, but the weapons to fight so that they could bleed often were brought to ivan by uncle sam, the British Empire which was in its last years, and I dont know how many humans alone the UK + commonwealth had? 25% of global population or even more? area was even better I think all allies and soviets together, the soviets had not a single diesel-electric train they produced, the US did deliver the trains and most of the diesel\u2026 this was very important to move ten thousand armored vehicles from deep siberia to location A and than from A to B (for example 1500km) pretty fast and so that the enemy didn\u2019t see it immediately (no smog like coal steam loks\u2026) I mean the so \u201cfeared\u201d Tiger and Tiger II was de facto not fighting US troops after D-Day in France, but almost every Panzer IV from a larger distance when it was dark was a tiger\u2026 the major negative effects in this case didn\u2019t play such a big role, but the Tiger I was produced only 78 times in 1942, 649 Tiger were produced in 1943 and I think in North Africa or Sicily the Allies/US troops made first contacts with the Tiger, if not even already in late 1942 but I think the priority was at the eastern front where these tanks really were needed much more, and than in 1944 before production was stopped to concentrate all ressources into the Tiger II (\u201cK\u00f6nigstiger\u201d) or incorrect translated as \u201cKing Tiger\u201d, the animals correct name is Royal Tiger afaik, in 1944 however another 623 were build\u2026 this makes for 1942 + 1944 = 701 + 649 = 1350. In July 1944 the production was 64 Tigers and in August another 6 before production was stopped. It was very rare compared to the enemies numbers\u2026 but the Tiger II was only produced 492 times between November 1943 and the last 30 \u201cKing Tigers\u201d were produced in March 1945. There are thousand reports alone from the US crews about Tigers, and the King Tiger with really not much tanks was seen during the Battle of the Bulge together with everything they had, but the fuel wasn\u2019t enough even to reach the first point (bridges) as the allied left not enough fuel for that beasts\u2026 The Tiger I and II had effects, psychological, and \u201cplaying\u201d a very realistic game like Hearts of Iron I wouldn\u2019t simply not build them, but in fact the Panther was the best if you check all 3 points (firepower, protection and mobility), it had a new and complex system for its tracks, I think something new and something electric\u2026 fixing this a bit and maybe even improving it, maybe adding here and there a bit armor and if possible a stronger engine if the Industry would be available\u2026 and maybe try to place the Tiger I\u2019s shorter 88mm gun into a new Panther generation? However much more panthers, fixing the problems you have with new vehicles using a new technique instead of sending them straight to the front like Hitler did at Kursk\u2026 Than the panther supported by some Tiger and other late-war tank-destroyers or assault guns (maybe replace the production of the StuG III and build more Jagdpanzer IV, the Skoda factories did build the Hetzer or Jagdpanzer 38(t) in the very late stage of the war, they build a lot and those fought well on the eastern front but were simply overwhelmed by numbers, stopping the whole Panzer III chassis (and all vehicles based on it) and only producing some more for some Jagdpanzer IV and than really build units of mobile panthers supported by assault guns and mobile AA-vehicles and ofc Tiger I and Tiger II for the very long range heavy armored enemies\u2026 In the air, improving the BMW Jumo 004 I think the engine was named as fast as possible, since the first (only?!) version only had a average liftime of 4 hours\u2026 improving this and stop hitlers crazy ideas of building Me 262 which is a fighter-design, and a good one, with jet propulsion it had a real advantage against turboprop enemies, but I think from 1200 build only a hand full was used in a single squadron from (Luftwaffe General) Galland who got promoted during the war but was a famous ace, his unit had almost only pilots which had the Knights Cross and there was a sarcastic inofficial name for that unit\u2026 because Galland annoyed Hitler I guess he allowed that fighter/interceptor unit, the number of fighter me 262 at once was so low during 1944, I have to correct even a total of 1433 aircraft of that type were build or another source is talking about 1368 of which 1039 were handed over to the Luftwaffe until 10th April 1945\u2026 some attacks of at least small groups of me 262 took place in the very last weeks before the luftwaffe collapsed completely (fuel etc), from early march until april groups between 26 and 37 of the Me 262 jets attacked US bombers, in one attack 26 of them attacked 1221 US-bombers escorted by 632 US-fighters, the Me 262 didnt had to be all fighter versions but without the bomb even these were a lot better than a usual turboprop fighter, in that one attack some of the 26 jets had up to 24 unguided air-to-air rockets and 13 bombers together with 6 escorts were shot down and 2 own Me 262 were lost. If you look at the number of ~1850 US-aircraft against a group of 26 jets\u2026 would all these aircraft had been build as fighter it would have been a bit harder over the skies of nazi germany in the 2nd half 1944 and 1945 I guess, if we think that in the \u201cbest\u201d case over 1000 of these reached the luftwaffe, now imagine what 5000 or 10000 with enough 100 octane fuel (an additional shortage of that fuel, the US/Allies had it) could have done\u2026 for the \u201cu-boots\u201d we have the same example, as many call it the \u201cfirst real submarine\u201d the Typ XXI was really a revolution, only 1 left in may as an official mission but ressources to build hundreds were \u201cwasted\u201d in 1944 already and later\u2026 it was the first submarine which was so fast under water compared to other submarines, that single submarine which went onto mission was hunted by 3 groups of submarine hunters but they always lost it, and hunted it and no group could explain why they lost the contact, they searched for it for at least 2 or 3 days each group with sonar, aircraft, dropping bombs just because a typical u-boot had to be somewhere in this area\u2026 not without reasons german scientists were wanted after the war and some of the technologies were the start of future great things like the space rockets based on V2 and build by the same person who constructed the rockets for the Nazis, he already as a child was dreaming of flying to the space, and he didn\u2019t care if it were nazis, communists or whatever, he could build it, during peace time no company or military would have allowed such a huge project, except later for the US in building better and better space rockets, the XXI submarine technology was the base for future allied submarines, added with nuclear power it was a perfect mix and still is, internet, phones, most \u201cnice\u201d things were made during war or at least for the military\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Better diplomacy. The more I read and learn about the history of both world wars, the more I think the weopon that Germany was missing between 1914\u20131945 was a better diplomatic instinct that understood that soft power can be as effective as hard power, particularly when they are used together. (Teddy Roosevelt understood this, which is why he chose to \u201cwalk softly but carry a big stick\u201c) In the first world war, Germany made so many mistakes from a diplomatic point of view. Their decision to invade France through Belgium brought the United Kingdom into the war, which meant the Royal Navy blockaded their ports and cut off their food supplies. This mistake led to the German decision to allow unlimited submarine warfare, in an effort to fight back against the British blockade, but this then caused friction with the United States. Then, to add insult to injury, the imperial German government made an even worse move, with their decision to send the Zimmerman telegram encouraging Mexico to take up arms against the United States. This brought the United States into the war. The German government was also terrible at mobilizing world opinion in their favor. The British naval blockade meant hunger and suffering in Germany, but the Germans were never able to get this message out to better support their need to have unlimited U Boat campaigns. Meanwhile, the allies took German atrocities in Belgium and made them into an international concern. In World War II, the Nazi war effort was hamstrung by a problem endemic to its nature, which was that weakness could never be acknowledged, and the winner will always be the one who projects the most strength (in their mind). Certainly, a weak leader can invite trouble by people who seek to take advantage of their weakness. But a leader who refuses to ever acknowledge mistakes or seek support risks alienating the people they wish to lead. For example, the Germans were not originally received poorly in places like the Ukraine, which had little love for their Soviet rulers. It was only after the Nazis insisted on treating the local population as subhuman that the people turned against them. In his diaries, Goebbels was aware that the Nazis were turning their conquered territories against Germany, but he didn\u2019t know what to do about it and the the Nazi philosophy of \u201cmight makes right\u201d didn\u2019t leave anyone much room to maneuver.

Zhukov Neither the USSR nor the UK stood a chance without access to massive quantities of US food, oil, aluminum, and other war materials. It\u2019s worth pointing out that the USSR couldn\u2019t feed itself in the 1930s during peacetime and the UK remained on food rationing until July, 1954. For additional background read Dima Vorobiev\u2019s answer to Would the Soviet Union have survived the German invasion without American military aid? That being said, once America entered the war, the only way Germany could win WW2 was to neutralize shipping coming from the USA. If in 1938/1939, the Kriegsmarine had prioritized the development of submarines that nullified Allied ASW the resulting \u201cWunderwaffens\u201d could have changed the outcome of the Battle Of The Atlantic. The Type 21 U-Boat had a streamlined hull, a nearly silent creep motor, an electric rapid torpedo-reloading system and 3 times the battery storage compared to standard U-boats. Its large batteries allowed it to travel underwater for 75 hours before needing a recharge. Had the Type 21 or something like it begun service in 1941/1942, Allied transports would have been defenseless. Most shipping between the USA and the UK/USSR would have been forced to stop. Without those ships, the UK and especially the Soviet Union wouldn\u2019t have lasted long. \u201cThe only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril.\u201d \u2014Winston Churchill ",

            "answer_text": "NONE. Yes, Germany had some truly innovative designs, and while it might have prolonged the end (and made it even bloodier) no wonder weapon would have changed the result. I\u2019ll debunk a few of the mentions Jet Fighters like the ME-262, HE-163 etc would have faced Allied Jets such as the Meteor, MiG-9, Yak-15 and P-80. Germany was not the only country to have jet fighters (that would be the American P-59), they were only the first to use them in combat but that lead would only last 6 months as Allied jet fighters were not that far behind. Modern Uboats like the XXI. First of all the type XXI was far from a perfect design. It was underpowered which limited it speed and increased battery charge times. Moreover The battle of the Atlantic was a constant struggle, first Germany was winning, then the allies, then Germany then finally the allies. I don\u2019t think anything would have changed, Germany would have sunk a lot more ships until the Allies developed a counter measure. It was quiet, but that was ineffective against active sonor systems. Wasserfall SAM\u2026suffered a major flaw, it had no proximity fuse so it was entirely guided by LOS by the operator on the ground. That means without good viability (at night, in cloud cover, or blinded by smoke) the weapon was basically useless. You couldn't just saturate an area with rockets like you can with AAA fire. The Wasserfall was simply too limited by the technology of the day. ",

            "answer_text": "One can conclude, even without considering their catastrophic performance during WW2, that the three most expensive Wonder weapons projects were the gravest waste of Germany's industrial potential. The data on economics and effectiveness are not easy to find by googling even on German sources. A lot of digging. But before going to weapons, let\u2019s take a look on their greatest doomed failure - the Atlantic Wall, \"Festung Europa\" - Fortress Europe. One may wonder why its idea came from from no other than Hitler, who approved Blitzkrieg tactics in France and Russia easily neutralizing Maginot and Stalin\u2019s line in Ukraine. The whole Atlantic Wall project was a massive undertaking - and considered folly by many. It cost Germany an estimated 3.7 billion Deutschmarks and used 17 million cubic meters of concrete and 1.2 million tons of steel. Whilst formidable, the fortifications did not prevent the Allies from landing on D-Day, although well located firing positions were responsible for many of the British, American and Canadian losses in the first few days of fighting. Results: 10.000 Allies losses and a couple day fight. At a cost of 100 \u2013200K per plane (1943\u20131940) 20.000 TO 40.000 U88 or Me-109 could be built and triple war production.  V1 and V-2 Rockets Only 30% reached their targets killing few London civilians and costing twice as much as the Manhattan project The V-1 according to Wiki (thanks to flyboy for gathering this data) cost was 5090 RM which equals $2044 US dollars during WW2, roughly $34,700 in todays dollars. It took 350 man hours to build so you could argue that each man hour is about 14 RM. British Response to V1 and V2 - The National Archives The people of Britain called the V1 missiles \u2018Buzz Bombs\u2019 or \u2018Doodlebugs\u2019. The first was dropped at Swanscombe in Kent on 13 June 1944 and the last one at Orpington in Kent on 27 March 1945. During that time, 6,725 were launched at Britain. Of these, 2,340 hit London, causing 5,475 deaths, with 16,000 injured. Three lines of defence were put in place against the missiles: fighter planes over the English coast, anti-aircraft batteries in Kent and barrage balloons around London. These were successful in destroying 3,500 V1 missiles. V2 rockets were first launched against England in September 1944. Over the next few months, nearly 1,400 struck London. They were less accurate than V1 missiles, but since they travelled at the speed of sound, and so made no warning noise before impact, it was almost impossible to defend against them.  Land Battles Fortunately the Maus tank project came too late and was aborted. It was an even more bizarre animal than the Char 2.   Char 2C: France's Super Heavy Tank (And Maybe the Biggest Ever)  Battleships.  German POWs from one of the battleships.  It was not only a military disaster. Let's next look at an economic effect, which is even more striking, by comparing it's cost with costs of airplanes and I boats. Construction and commissioning: Kriegsmarine Werft in Wilhelmshaven received a contract to build the battleship on June 14, 1936. The work on the hull construction began on October 24 and the ship was launched on April 1, 1939. During the launch ceremony the official name of the new battleship was finally revealed. The vessel was to be named after Gro\u00dfadmiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the father of the Imperial German Navy. The battleship was christened by the late Admiral\u2019s daughter, Frau von Hassel. Its projected cost in 1936 was 200M RMs or 15M man-hours at 14 DM tariff. Upon receiving Britain's approval in 1936 Hitler shrieked- \"It is the happiest day in my life\". 250 Meter lang und 36 Meter breit: Die \"Bismarck\" war ein gewaltiges Schiff \u201c250 meters long and 36 meters wide, the Bismarck was a huge ship\u201d  U-Boats The construction cost of a famous U 161 reached 6.448.000 Reichsmark, which gives a ratio of 30 to 1.  Airplanes The man-hour cost for the Messerschmitt Bf 109 dropped to 4000 with the 'G' model, slightly more than took for the Fw 190, to be produced. It gives us a striking ratio of 3600 Bfs (15.000 in 1944) for a single ship, or more than Germany\u2019s total airplane production in WW2. Me-262s were A-1a variants. So that doesn't tell us much about airframe production cost. I have historical cost data for Ju-88 airframe so we can use that for an example. RM 216,523. Production cost for Junkers built Ju-88A4 during 1940.RM 139,274. Production cost for Junkers built Ju-88A4 during 1943.Late production Ju-88 costs one third less then early production aircraft. Given the cheaper jet engines the Me 262 may even have been cheap Hence a Me 262 airframe ay RM87,400 must have been worth just under 6000 man hours. But it was too late to have any effect and its killing ratio was below cost ratio.  Generally, costs were sharply reduced towards 1944. Me 262 airframe was RM87,400 worth just under 6000 man hours. At the end Me 109K4 got down to 1000 hours per airframe but was closer to 2000 the year before. It also was around 6000 hours in 1940. There is not necessarily a direct relationship between man hours and costs as costs may factor in use of precious raw materials better or R+D costs that are being amortised.  Conclusion. Without quixotic projects brought about by Hitler, Germany could have at least doubled its conventional fighting arsenal. And this without mentioning that 90% of Manhattan project scientists were European Jews. But that is another story.  ",

This meant that while the allies could use materials from all over the world the Nazis were limited to using materials in Europe. All of the traditional Nazi Wunderwaffe (tanks, jets, missiles, submarines) needed to be mass produced and they needed high quality metals. The Nazis didn\u2019t have the raw resources to mass produce them. The most obvious manifestation of this issue was in jet aircraft. The British Meteor was more reliable than the Nazi ME262 because the Nazis didn\u2019t have access to the materials needed to make the alloys required for reliable jet engines. The British didn\u2019t have to use the Meteor against 262s since allied propeller aircraft like Mustangs and Spitfires already overwhelmed the 262 with sheer numbers. The Nazis only needed a few nuclear bombs to win the war. While they didn\u2019t have enough materials to build 10,000 jet fighters and 100 Type 21 submarines they could have built enough nukes to turn Southeast England, parts of Russia and large Allied troop concentrations to ash. Nuclear bombs would have crippled Britain and Russia and inflicted such huge casualties that even the USA could have easily been forced out of the war by public pressure. A single Nazi Type 21 sub could even have been loaded with a nuke and sent on a nuclear kamikaze mission against the US east coast. ",

The US became the worlds leading power because of brain drain, and the Nazis started to eliminate the brains.Also, the Nazis didn\u2019t invest in the next generation, or continuation, the young generation. Make enough enemies and the erosion of the power(s) one has over over, or influence on others, starts to diminish.This is what is presently happening with the US; not to late yet to turn the ship around but time is running out. The only thing that could have happened is delaying the inevitable: One can argue that much of what Nazi-Germany developed had a huge impact on the technological advancements in the later part of the century. When resources become scarce, what is commonly known as the \u201cAmerican Know-How,\u201d ingenuity arises. The Wunderwaffen was propaganda, but far more important were all the other, overlooked inventions, artificial rubber comes to mind. Some weaponry was functional, and if properly used, and/or selectively given more priority, could have become problematic for the Allies. However, time was running out to perfect them and/or some resources were not available. Biggest shortage of resource was the human capital, and given much was built using slave-labor, sabotaging played a huge role. What I heard growing up, was born in 1950, there were two weapons that could have been very problematic for the allies: The submarines. It was understood that unless the transatlantic shipping can stifled the war will be lost becasue of the might of the US industry. The U-boat captains stated over and over \u201cthey know were we are, they wait for us.\u201d Long story short: The German admiralty caused the progressive no-returns of the U-boats. The Me-262. It had the capability to make the bombing raids non-justifiable for the allied \u201cbrass.\u201d One can only loose so many aircrafts, and more importantly, airmen, before the questioning increases and the justifications loose out. On a side line: The bombing was a war crime, and I heard that effectively Churchil and his supporters in this should have been tried as war criminals for the fatalities on allied airmen.Here is the \u201csomething to think about, from the book \u201cHitler and his physicians.\u201d Hitler and his inner circle was shown a prototype of the M2\u2013262, to be given more resources to finalize it. This is what a physician said: \u201cHumans cannot survive the speed and maneuverability of the plane, they are lying. They want more resources that can be better spent on other programs.\u201d And this is what happened. ",

            "answer_text": "Cultural sensitivity trainings! Imagine a Germany that kept its universities intact and allowed Jewish physicists to feel patriotic rather than build nuclear weapons for the USA. A Germany that fought Stalin\u2019s Communism instead of raping and murdering and planning to displace Ukrainians and others \u2014 fighting Stalin with many people who felt conquered by Communism instead of cornering that population and getting fierce and consistent resistance. The US dominated the second half of the 20th century partly because we had a reputation for democracy and anti-colonialism (which we squelched, but that\u2019s another story) and got cooperation where people fought the Nazis like their lives and their families lives depended on it, obviously. Hate makes enemies. ### The Nazi path to power was to get Germans whose pride was hurting and felt shame to transform that shame into blame. That hate and blame of course consumed them. If you just gave the actual hate-filled blame-everyone Nazis a superweapon, even if space aliens handed them nuclear weapons in 1942, they would conquer, expand, and need to find someone new to hate: all that was in their future was civil war if they won. They ran up debts, built up hate, destroyed the amazing German universities full of liberal professors and Jewish professors who developed the science during the pre-Nazi period that just built weapons under Nazis \u2014 the \u201cwunderwaffen\u201d were one of many things where the Nazis were killing the goose that layed the golden eggs. Maybe in some alternate timeline some anti-Nazi hippy time-traveler got Hitler high on mushrooms and showed videos of other cultures, and it accidentally helped him win the war. ",

Germany never had a realistic chance of going toe to toe with Britain, the Free French, the Soviets and the Americans while relying on conventional or even qualitatively superior conventional weapons. The odds against Germany were roughly 10 to 1 and to even those one needs miracles and miracle weapons. Type XXI u-boats in their last configuration (faster underwater than above, beyond effect speed of an escort vessel using sonar, employing burst radio transmissions and auto-loading torpedo tubes) could have been available significantly sooner (1940 or 41) including most technology needed. And they would have made quite the difference in the Battle of the Atlantic. Same if Germany had had the 300 u-boats D\u00f6nitz wanted instead of the 30 he got. The V1 was quite effective though bombing England was a dead end compared to blocking it off. Some of the weapons coming only in 1944 and later, the StG 44, the Himmler Orgel, etc. could have had quite an impact if they had come sooner. And so on and on. ",

            "answer_text": "Their nuclear weapons program. MAYBE. It would depend on how early they got it going and how many they made, and of course it's yield. for example India's first atomic weapon was about 1/5th the power of the Hiroshima bomb. But one nuclear weapon set off in Paris, one v2 even if it didn't hit exactly where it was aimed in London, one dropped on Moscow in Russia really would have had a major effect and multiple could have ended the war in Europes western front quickly. Two caused Japan to surrender. With no idea what the treaty would be. And they were as locked in on fighting and dying until the last man as anyone. I'm not sure other nations would have a stronger fight when hit like that. There's a chance the allies wouldn't be able to form a 2nd front\u2026 which had to be geographically concentrated (D-Day) and a prime target. The big wild card of that scenario that I think might be there is Russia. Russia lost a LOT of men. And kept coming. And had a lot of space. But even with that I think you'd have the US to worry about who were building their own and with separation and possibly time to develop delivery, though germany would be working on the same. Germany though arming Japan's navy with nuclear weapons might change that quickly (aircraft carriers that could deliver nuclear ordinance would wreck the Pacific fleet and potentially slow delivery to US coastal cities). Or maybe a cold war, except instead of the communists stopped at eastern europe it's the Germans with all of it possibly\u2026 A LOT of what ifs there. But if one could, that's the one I see having the capability to change the outcome. Honestly there\u2019s not many right or wrong answers how that would have gone, just lots of conjecture. ",

There was simply far too many bombers and production of pilots and personnel to operate them could be kept for years. Type XXI submarines could make the battle for the Atlantic much more longer and costly but it would never be able to destroy the ever increasing allied shipping build up. Horten Brothers flying wings needed on board computers to be flyable and viable. V-1 rockets had a big psychological effects but the reality is that they couldn\u2019t produce a guidance system to achieve a direct hit against an specific target. Only in the era of GPS this could be done. V-2 rockets had the same issue, without in-flight correction capabilities a direct strategic hit couldn\u2019t be achieved. V-3 would never have worked without a computerized detonation system. Something that I don\u2019t think has ever been invented. Tanks such as the Standard series could have done the war much costlier, but they were heavy and engines would have had a hard time achieving the power and torque needed for them. The only way Germany could have won the war is having the capability of producing enough minerals and fuel to keep their forces supplied with good equipment and provisions. They did make breakthroughs in producing synthetic fuel. But it just wasn\u2019t enough, either primary materials or productive infrastructure. ",

You need trained crews to use those weapons, fuel to power them, parts to fix them, etc. Germany was losing a huge amount of manpower and resources. They had nowhere they could effectively build weapons before deploying them. Let\u2019s say they built all the Me-262s they wanted. They\u2019d already lost air superiority, where would they train pilots when most of the country was constantly traversed by Allied long-range fighter-bombers? Meanwhile, both the US and Russia have tons of available manpower, resources and safe areas for manufacturing. The US is able to supply both Russia and Britain via cheap, easy-to-build freighters called \u201cLiberty ships\u201d - my grandfather served on one of them - and even during the worst of the war was able to keep building more to replace their losses. Interestingly, even while we were at war with Japan, the Japanese navy didn\u2019t interfere with US supplying Russia, because they didn\u2019t want Russia entering the war against Japan! Meanwhile, the US is using Britain as the world\u2019s largest aircraft carrier, building a ton of supplies there that the Germans can no longer reach since they lost their offensive air power during the Battle of Britain. Maybe, just maybe, the way the Germans could have won the war would have been to put more resources into unrestricted submarine warfare earlier in the war - that\u2019s not really a \u201cWunderwaffen\u201d though, but just a reallocation of resources. But I kind of doubt it, and I don\u2019t know that they could have provided those resources even if they wanted to. Germany was just not that much of a naval power. ",

Looking at the other comments and seeing just what Germany and her allies were up against it seems amazing that they did as well as they did. And quite a few youtube videos suggest that Germany could have won the war. Everyone seems to focus on the Western allies, yet my understanding is that the war was lost for Germany in the East. What could Germany have done to win that war, the German/Soviet war of 1941\u20131945? Even with horse-drawn Infantry and supplies, not sufficient oil, Germany seems to have come close. Was the Soviet Union ready to crack? Hmmm. I read somewhere that both Churchill and FDR expected Germany to defeat the Soviet Union, but both would be so weaken so as to not be a problem. I think that because of the vast distances into the Soviet Union and fewer towns more widely spaced (?) that it is very difficult to attack Russia from the West. Distance and fewer cities also defeated Napoleon. I think it is easier attack to the West because of more cities closer together. Perhaps a wonder weapon against the Western Allies might have allowed Germany to concentrate on the East. I don\u2019t know that the East lent itself to a wonder weapon. Other than perhaps better intelligence. If Germany had a true read on the size of the Soviet manpower, saw large Soviet armies advancing like at Stalingrad and even earlier before Moscow, things might have been adjusted in time. I think the key lies in the East. ",

The British on the other hand had weaponized anthrax and had deadly plans for its use if the war had escalated just that extra bit. Why both sides refrained remains partially unknown: a notion of \u2018mutual assured destruction\u2019 avant la lettre might have played a role, so might have Hitlers personal confrontation with poison gas in WWI or simply the inability of the Wehrmacht to develop gas masks for their horses. Anyhow, my post should drive home the observation that WWII is not a good stage to have a radically different outcome depending on the introduction (or not) of a deus-ex-machina-wunderwaffe on either side: none of the combattants seem to have been already fully comitted, despite the rethoric about \u2018total war\u2019 etc. E.g. if the Germans would have had jet-engines sooner, then the British could have dropped their anthrax cakes in response and from there you have to theorize in a new reality where already more than 2 factors change at once, making it impossible to track who might have ended on top in such a more drawn-out, tragic conflict.

In early 1944 Germany was so to say \u201cspent\u201d in every relevant way resourceswise and logistically - winning the war was out of the question, even with an atomic bomb, surface to air missiles, air to surface sea missiles, remote controlled torpedoesm, night vision etc. Ok, if they could come up with 100 atom bombs and a 100 intercontinental ballistic missiles with kamikaze pilots and navigators I can see that they could create som problems for the allied. They would have bought time. And perhaps a peace treaty. But, that is not realistic in any way, the technology was not there as well as the resources for that were missing. I can see two clear indicators on Germany loosing the war. First, the launch of operation Overlord i mid -44 from the allied side, and second, from the internal German side - the 20 July 1944, Claus von Stauffenberg and other conspirators attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler and take over the central administration of Germany. These two events are clear signs that the war would eventually end in German defeat. The main question for the allied was more or less were to draw the line to Soviet union and what would happen to the poor countries behind that line that would face Stalins version of communism. ",
