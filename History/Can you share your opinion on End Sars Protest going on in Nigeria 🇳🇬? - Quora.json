            "answer_text": "I think it's an opportunity for the youths to show the government how determined we are to make our country work again.  Nigerian youths including myself are calling for an end to the Special Anti-Robbery squad Unit of the Nigerian police force. This call is due to the fact that a lot of Nigerian youths who were never armed, may have never robbed in their lives finally became the sole targets of officers of this police unit. The SARs or special Anti-Robbery squad is a unit of the Nigerian police force initiated to help curtail the activities of thieves in the country. They initially did this job perfectly but after a while the whole thing got to their head as they started harassing Nigerian youths.  Despite the section of Nigerian law making it clear that mobile phones and laptops or whatever gadgets you wield as aniherjan youth are totally yours and warrants no search from any member of the armed forces unless you're a reported person or reported to be carrying sensitive data that threatens national security. Men of the SARS unit have regularly harassed young men and children for no just cause and in recent times, some of these youths would end up getting shot and killed for a crime they never committed The #ENDSARS Hashtag took over the internet after the murder of another Nigerian in Delta State of Nigeria. This sparked the recent protest in Ughelli after which other youths in other metropolitan cities (Lagos, Abuja, Portharcourt, etc) took to the streets to make their voices loud enough for all to know the hurt and damage SARS has done to all. Aside making their voices heard, the protest would also serve the Government the opportunity to meet the demand of these people and make them happy for ones in a lifetime, however the reverse has been the case as majority of the protesters are often attacked by either thugs or policemen. Personally I think the protest should be a wake up call for any leader that has been looking for ways to make it up to the average Nigerian youth. All the while, they did all they could to provoke us, but we kept calm This time, we're out and we're fighting the good fight Things that makes the protest interesting\u2026 Over the past few days, Nigerians both home and abroad has donated over \u20a640 million and this has been used to povide food to protesters.We have a lot of legal practitioners offering legal services for arrested protesters and ensuring their release as quickly as possible.The governor of Anambra state has confirmed the sack of OC Nwafor. OC Nwafor is the former leader of SARS Akwuzu. A section of the SARS known for always killing any one it arrests even though the person is innocent of the charges.These protesters are actually neat. After their protest, they ensure the streets are kept clean by cleaning up every piece of dirt in the protest area.The protest has clearly shown that all the government claimed to have done with all the billions allocated to alleviate Covid19 induced poverty were actually false. According to a protester, the government claimed to have spent 60 Billion Naira feeding Nigerians during the pandemic but no one could come out to confirm receiving any thing from the Government.While protesting, it was observed that some armed youths actually came to oppress and disperse protesters but the #Endsars protesters in Lagos gathered funds and used same to hire private security men to guard them while protesting. This is a great move. Also, in Abuja metropolis, Hausa youths came out with sticks in an attempt to chase away protesters but these protesters caught these criminals and beat them almost to the point of death and handed them over to the police. What a time to be proud of my generationIts over 8 days now and the protest is still on going. This clearly shows that Nigerians have finally waken up and decided to make something work for them and the outcome is, we've seen a lot of moves by the government to try to quench the protest by first ending SARS and initiating another unit called SWAT. However, because of the fact that the new unit \u201cSWAT\u201d was initiated without proper training of the officers to meet international standard, Nigerian youths took the protest with a new hashtag \u201c#EndSWAT\u201d showing that they do not accept the recycling of officers form SARS into swat. It's all a good thing to behold. Personally I've never witnessed my fellow youths having a voice towards one goal. I'm happy I lived at these times and I believe these are times when Nigerian would become great again. Well, I must not forget the lady in the images below whose 3 brothers were murdered same day, dumped in a well to rotten by men of special anti robber squad  It must have been such a heart breaking moment for her to the point that she could fly her country flag but rather sat on a statue of lion with tears trickling down her eyes  Let's also not forget Aisha Yesufu who had actually used her voice to air every pain and needs of the average Nigerian youth. May Allah bless your soul ma'am. She's done her best best to ensure no level of intimidation could ever stop her from the protest  By this post, I therefore call on every nation in the world and Africa not to panic. Nigeria is going to be great again\u2026 The youths slumber no more If you're a Leader in Africa, expect more protest in your country because Nigerian has always being the pacesetter. If you've always done stuffs against the people or supported policies that hurt the people, be ready because Africans aren't like they used to be no more. Don't forget to learn about House Flipping? We shall take back out glory ",

            "answer_text": "It's going to be a long read, so please stay with me. First, I'd like to say what I think really doesn\u2019t matter and it's not as important as what the protest is all about and actually what it has brought on us as a nation. #EndSARS protest as we all know it, was primarily a reaction to the unprofessional and unethical conduct of a police unit that was created to deal with armed robbery. Now, this police unit whom I like to say went rogue brought so much pain and fear on the Nigerian youths so much that the fear and pain drove them to do what hitherto was never considered possible; protest. Everyone who knows the history of Nigeria will tell you protest, of any sort is almost impossible. Many times that people with names and clout have tried to organizea protest, it never succed. From Charly boy to Tuface, to Sowore etc. It has always been a flop and crowd never really identified with those. Now, come this group of young individuals, who have a common story about harassment, extortion and in some cases threat to their life, just by been young and trendy by an enforcement unit that was never meant to interface with the many hardworking NigerIan youths, whom most are self employed or students. For years prior, voices from victims of the supposed anti robbery squad, a unit that was designed as a cracked team to deal with the rising wave of hardcore criminal activities like bank robbery, kidnapping etc was echoing. Several attempts were made to publicly report their rogue activities both on social media and through protest, yet this victimized voices were never heard, especially by those in power like the police authorities, the lawmakers nor the executive arm of government. Like the say in the local Nigeria English language; everyday na for thief, but one day na for the owner of the house. (All day belong to the thief, but there comes a day for the one who owns the house). That day was to happen and the once ignored voice was heard, and heard loud and clear. Why was this once voiceless voice heard? It was heard because like we know of the devil; when he's taken over you, you'll lose the ability to recognize lines never to cross. These supposed unit of the Nigerian police force, who by now have become law by themselves, especially since they've witnessed all attempt to bring them to justice failed, started crossing lines that aren't supposed to be crossed by any sane enforcement mind. The victims of their rogue activities began to look like those who were supposed to be above police harassment or brutality. People who by virtue of the social status were known to have legitimate sources of income and in most cases celebrities. SARS, which stand for Special anti robbery squad started harassing and brutalizing entertainers like commedians, musicians and even footballers amongst other notable popular professionals. At this point, the voiceless victims realized that this was a good time and a wonderful opportunity to speak up again, and maybe their voices will be heard, since those with voice are now also victims and may likely want to identify with them. Nigerians woke up one morning in the early week of October 2020 and started hearing voices, both on social media and on the street of lagos crying again over this same brutal police unit rogue activities, only that this time, the once voiceless voice now appears to have found real legitimate voice like popular musician Davido, Wizkid, and other influential entertainers from the film and media industry. While we were still trying to analyze this event, the voice became louder, and started sounding from far countries and nations like the USA, UK, Germany etc. Fellow entertainers, sports personalities in show of solidarity and support for their own in profession and age began to speak loud and clear all over social media. Some on recorded videos, others via write ups. At this point the voices in Nigeria decided to take it beyound social media and conventional media to the street, especially to the places and people who were supposed to have heard them since they started crying. It started like something that was designed to make a point, send signal to the Nigerian authorities and the world about the brutality of the Nigerian police, then retreat to wait for an answer and maybe reaction as was always the case with very view protests in Nigeria, but alas the voices became not only louder as days rolls into weeks, but more authoritative and demanding. At this juncture those in power who were directly responsible to give the answers began to scamper for actions to pacify these new set of Nigerians never seen nor experienced before. While some like President Buhari scoffed and laughed at them, dismissing any report about the need to take the youngsters serious. The police IG quickly within few days announced the scrapping of SARS, then few days after followed that with an instruction that all the now scrapped SARS officers should report to the force headquarters Abuja for questioning and phycological evaluation to determine whether or not they were still fit to continue serving in the police force. He quickly announced the formation of another anti robbery unit code name SWART; Special weapon and robbery team, which according to some sources in Nigeria was already in existence but not operational. That move didn't go down well with many Nigerians who felt it was hastily done and smells of the old antics to get protesters to back down. The governor of Lagos state, Mr Babajide Sanwo Olu quickly went to meet with the protesters at the protest ground, in show of solidarity and support and even walked with them carrying placards, so where some other state governors. Yet this moves by the authorities did not yield any meaningful result nor did it offer the government the opportunity to negotiate with the protesters who we were told very often had no leader nor leaders. The form of leaderless protest made it difficult for negotiation by those in authorities and had its merits and demerits, some of which gave birth to the outcome of the protest as we know it today. On few occasions, certain known faces and individuals both from the political and entertainment sector tried to take the center stage and then represent the face of the protest, on each of those few instances the protesters rose in one voice and told these individuals point blank; you're not our leader and in fact in some instances, they were told they did not belong with them; they protesters. The benefit of not having a leader or leaders , even though some faces more prominent that the others were seen at different centers across the country leading the protest or making demands, is that unlike previous attempted protest, including the Tuface Idiabia segment, government can not harras/ arrest any one single individual or individuals as been in charge, nor leadership compromised. This method worked well for the essence of the protest for a while, yet worked against it at the end. Yes, no one individual or individuals were arrested, harassed or payed off by the government to compromise with the protest agenda, but having no leader made it impossible for the protesters to draw the line between protest and revolutionary movement. The endorsement from prominent religious and public individuals from within and outside outside the country who lauded them as the new face of Nigeria helped to start creating the picture of revolution in the mind of the larger crowd of protesters. With this picture created, every government attempt to pacify the protesters including alluding to some of their demands was seen as not enough, hence the need to put more pressure which include expanding the scope of demand, from an end to SARS rogue activities to police brutality, police reforms, to an end to bad governance, restructuring of the country and more specific demand like \u2018End Buhari\u2019. At the unfolding of this new developments, the state actors at different levels and locations began to panick, sensing that things might get out of hand and affect them in ways never imagined. News and rumors of state/politicians sponsored thugs starting to make rounds. This rumours and news were been fueled by viral videos of thugs emerging from government owned public transportation outfits in Lagos, to knife wielding individuals embarking from a supposed state intelligent outfit\u2019s SUV in Abuja etc. Immediately both the Lagos state government and the popular state kingpin MC Olomu accused of sending his boys came out to debunked the news , so did the federal government. Now, whether or not this rumours and news were true, those incident helped fired the protesters as they believe that the government and politicians are now afraid and have started feeling the heat of their presence, and that sooner or later they'll make a more grievous mistake, one that will expose the government corrupt ways and impunity to the outside world. And surely that happened on that faithful and now memorable 20/10/20. But before delving into a brief of the incident, let me quickly add at this juncture that some people, like myself were already calling for restrain on the side of the protesters. I personally tried to reach out by tweets, instagram post and watsap messages for the protesters to reconsider the street type of protest which was gradually been hijacked by miscreants, who at this point were blocking major roads preventing law abiding citizens access unless the pay their passage fees, and move to strategic government establishments and faculties. Stories of rape and harassment were also beginning to emerge. While this was ongoing, the police could no longer intervene and the streets were left in the hands of protesters, some of whom had other intentions other than what the peaceful protest was all about, and miscreants, popularly known as area boys in Lagos took charge of the streets. So, it was becoming increasingly clear to some of us who were observing the trend where the whole thing was leading to, especially given how quick the police authorities withdrew police from the street, while government did not fully replace them with either the civil defense or army, which was necessary at this point to maintain law and order. On late morning of that faithful 20/10/20, the Lagos state governor announced a 24hours curfew, which was said to begin by 4pm, though we later heard it was shifted to 7pm. With the lekki toll gate, which was the epicenter of the movement still crowded by the peaceful protesters, we know there was going to be a showdown, but not the magnitude of which became known today, especially on social media as \u201c lekki toll gate massacre\u201d, or Lekki genocide. A few hours after the deadline for lagosians to vacate the streets were given by the governor, pictures and videos of wounded and puported dead protesters started flooding the Internet. Prominent amongst them was the ones from a popular female DJ; DJ Switch who we were told was called or called BBC news and they had her live as the incident unfolds. Amongst the various images and videos being shared was the ones where some people in army uniform were seen shooting in the air, with so many gun shots heard even as they picture of the supposed army fades. Bloodstained hand and large Nigerian flags were seen everywhere, with echoes of the nigerian national anthem coming from the seated crowd. These images conjures in the mind of everyone who saw it, a heinous crime been perpetrated by an army against defenceless innocent youths, who were even trying to convey their loyalty by singing the Nigerian national anthem while seating helplessly on the floor of the toll plaza. Immediately news started flying on the social media of the incident, with different conspiracy theories. yours faithfully was one of those who started tweeting and demanding that the army defence headquarters through their twitter handle, which was very much alive that night through the wee hours of the next morning explain what happened. Like expected the army denied knowledge of the incident and insisted their men was never at the site of the supposed killing of innocent people. Nigerians were not buying that explanation, and were even infuriated the more when in the morning the governor of Lagos state denied that anybody died, while claiming he had no knowledge of who ordered solders at the place, even as he had no power to give such order. Regardless of who ordered solders at the scene, or the army denying those were not their men, one thing was certain, events that will follow the senseless killing or shooting in the dark at peaceful protesters who by this time had already become popular will alter for sure not just the fate of the police in Nigeria, but the entire Nigeria nation. By the next morning, nigerians all across different states in the country took to the street protesting, now in anger. Defying curfew or and executive directive against protest. The result as we know it today was very very disastrous, and I'm sure would've gotten those behind the army shooting at the lekki tool gate wondering if indeed it was worth their irrational actions. Many government structures, first starting with the lekki toll plaza and the sister in ikoyi link bridge were set ablaze and properties destroyed. Policemen were now victims as they became target of these angry protesters, and their reaction or in action saw the burning down to aches so many police stations across the country, especially in the southern part, while many innocent police officers lost their lives. Malls, shops and properties owned by both corporate and private individuals were set ablaze and goods looted. The effect can never be quantified in monetary terms, even though former Lagos governor who is now a minister said Lagos alone lost more than a trillion naira. A new phase of a once complacent nation, who never take on any government before in the face of poverty and hardship owing to corrupt and bad leadership was opened. Mobs started going to warehouses looking for foods stored from the covid-19 palliative, after a video went viral of people hustling food from a supposed warehouse rented or owned by the Lagos state government. Almost every state had mobs haunting and then carting away not just foods but household properties from warehouses and politicians houses. The videos and pictures of this scary mob invasion was both scary and pathetic. It clearly demostrated in a million ways the depth of deprivation and poverty in the land, which certainly is a fallout of many decades of corrupt and bad government. It was indeed a sad awakening moment for every Nigerian and I am sure one the political class will never forget in a hurry. That said, the #Endsars protest, which appeared to not have reached its destination per say, has actually brought upon Nigeria and Nigerians a new chapter. A chapter that every Nigerian would be happy to see unfolds, even though it was brought on the back of many deaths and destruction. Yet it is one everyone, except for the political class and the corrupt police officers will secretly be happy to have witnessed, and watch how it turns out. Today, there are no police officers or any other uniformed people on the road, except the military, and there's a general consensus that policing will never be the same again in Nigeria, it is also believed there be a high level of caution on the side of the political class with their once know impunity and penchant for corruption and total disregard of the law. In conclusion, I'd say, two things or maybe three things would've been done to avert the loss of human lives and properties. One, if government, had been smart enough to identify that even though the peaceful protest had no know leadership, there were faces or individuals whose faces and names carried enough influence to change the trajectory of the protest, at least to change the course. These are individuals who havery been known to speak for the people, mostly against the government, and some of whom formed the early protesters. Others were influential religious leaders who have lend their voices in support or solidarity of the cause. Either ways, words of encouragement or advice to restrategize would've have calmed the protesters and give government enough time and chance to step up on fulfilling some of the demands, that is if government was really sincere in dealing with the protesters demand. Two, yes, a curfew was necessary to checkmate the activities of hoodlums who at this time had started gradually to infiltrate the protesters and started creating problems, but government would've still allowed certain locations to serve as authorized protest ground, while negotiation will be intensified as protest continues at these legalized locations. Then under no circumstances should armed military be sent to the protest ground, much less to start shooting after the lights went out. It all looked like premeditated action on the part of government and will take more than denying or playing down the incident to change this narrative. Thirdly, if immediately after the lekki toll gate incident, President Buhari had addressed the nation, condemned the action of the army, promised to investigate and bring to book all those found guilty, while promising to adeqadequately compensate families of those who lost their lives, even as security officers were given instructions to deal with miscreants and thugs who have hijacked a once peaceful protest to unleash mayhem across our cities. A speach like that, other than the type the President gave two days after which rendered Nigerians speachless would've gone a long way to curtail the damages witnessed after the lekki tool gate incident. Yes, none of those I just suggested was to be or happened, so the deed was done, we are now left with the scares of failed and inept leadership, while secretly wondering if the protesters got more than they demanded or government was able to defuse and deactivate the already timed bomb, even though they may have done it using unconventional means. Whatever it is, only time will tell. But for now, let's just agree that you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs like French people say. Believing this is what it means to us as Nigerians, even as theere are moves by the peaceful protesters to regroup and restrategize. To every life lost, i say; rest in power. And to everyone or family who lost loved ones, i pray for strength to overcome the grief while trusting their sacrifices will never be in vain. Finally to businesses and individuals whose businesses and properties were destroyed, i pray you find strength and help to bounce back. To every Nigerian, I say; arise o compatriots, nigeria call, obey. ",
