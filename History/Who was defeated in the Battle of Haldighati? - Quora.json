            "answer_text": "You can call it a stalemate but a strategic and tactical victory of mewar led by maharana Pratap Singh. It is plain lie that he was defeated. At the end of the day both forces went back to original places. Mughals under maan Singh failed to achieve their objective of capturing maharana Pratap. Mewar army was in dominant postion until the rumours of akbars arrival was spread by some of their commanders to stop their soldiers running away as the initial attack of mewar army was so furious that the vanguard of mughals was routed and rest started retreating. Them rohmour was spread that Akbar is arriving in battlefield but he was nowhere near battlefield he was far away in ajmer. At this critical juncture maharana Pratap took a daring chance of attacking maan Singh and went through cutting enemy ranks and threw the spear towards maan Singh who was sitting on elephant but instead his mahout who was riding elephant was killed and maan Singh feel down from elephant and soldiers took him to base camp. But maharana was surrounded by mughals soliders and he was already wounded . Here one of the generals of mewar jhala man Singh or jhala beeda who looked identical like maharana took over Rana prataps royal insignia and mukut and asked him to retreat to mewar army base camp in koliyari to save him and fight again for lager benefit of mewar and rajputana. Rana agreed and jhala took over command of mewar army and distracted mughals. Rana Pratap reached base camp and mughals too went back to same position. But maharana Pratap has deployed a bhil tribal army in the mountains which attacked mughals camp covertly at night and mughals wen tto gogunda but here too maharana Pratap had ordered all his subjected to burn fields and farms and result was mughals were starving and they were forced to retreat even from gogunda . So it was a tactical and strategic victory of maharana pratap. Maan Singh was banished from Mughal court for brief time by Akbar for his failure.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well there is no case to say that Maharana Pratap was victorious because he had to flee from the battlefield. The story of one of his generals replacing him under the Umbrella and Maharana Pratap\u2019s horse Chetak saving him are quite famous. At best we can say that the battle ended in a stalemate: neither side won. Mughals & allies had marched all the way from Delhi/Agra/Jaipur to Haldighati to defeat the Rana. However, they could neither kill him or capture Rana. Mughals did not chase the Rana\u2019s army which escaped the battlefield of Haldighati as the Mughal army was several times the size of Rana\u2019s army. This suggests that Mughals also suffered significant losses and lost the will to fight further. So none of the Mughal battle objectives were achieved. Rana fled the battlefield. However, after the battle, he maintained his independence and continued opposition to Mughals. It would be correct to that this particular battle ended in a stalemate. ",
