            "answer_text": "There was No Word: Albanian Albania in the region before the 11th century. GREECE: The ancient Greeks lived in Illyria and Epirus thousands of years before Christ. The ancient Greeks lived in Illyria and Epirus thousands of years before Christ, before the Albanians appeared in these regions. (11th century A.D.) The Arvanitiki or Arvanitic language was spoken by Greek ancestors Pelasgoi thousands of years before the Albanians had their language. The provinces of Illyria and Epirus were integral parts of the ancient Greek world. Illyria was a province of Macedonia, where the Olympiad was descended from the mother of Alexander the Great, whom Albanians now call Albanian. (Here with the propaganda they made Alexander the great of Slavo will not make the Olympics Albanian?) The Greek cities of the region mentioned in them all the ancient writers, countless: Antigonia, Phoenicia, Amanttia (there is preserved ancient Greek Stadium of the 3rd century B.C.), Epidaurus ancient port, today Durres from where the Egnatia road began, Other Greek cities? Antivarys, Alesion, Kroia, Apollonia, Arkion (keep the city of Arkion because it is the spearhead), Avlona, Kandina, Oriko, Chimira (current Chimara). All These cities are ignored by propagandists historians?????? From the city of \u0391\u03c1\u03b2\u03ce\u03bd (Arvon), the inhabitants of the area were called: Arv\u03cenites=Arvonites (Assimilation of -\u03ce with - a) which is: Arvanites. That's what *Anna Komnene wrote. And also the historian and scholar Anna Komnene wrote that there was no word of Albania or Albanian in the area before the 11th century A.D. She wrote the Alexiad ( which it is an account of her father\u2019s reign during Byzantium reign.

These are all part of the main European haplogroups. The I2 and E1b1b are very old markers, being in Europe, mostly in the South, since Paleolitic and make 43% of the total. The Indo-European markers: R1b (Western), R1a (Eastern) and J2 (Southern) make 45% of the total. Considering the proportion being similar to the neighbouring people, Albanians are, more likely Illirians in a 90% proportion. Language could or could not reflect it, but that\u2019s to say about most European countries that have genes non-conform with the languages they speak. See French, Spanish, or Portuguese speaking Latin based languages while population is Celtic 80%. Same with English who speak a Germanic language. Austria is more similar to Balkanic countries (Thracians, Dacians and Illirians) and speak German. Even Southern part of Germany is more Celtic than Germanic (R1b much more than I1). Swedes are more Germanic, with higher proportions of I1. Italians are all different from North (Celtic R1b), to Middle (R1b and J2 Etruscan) to South (E1b1b Greek). ",

            "answer_text": "First of all i want to say that Communism in Europe unfortunately brought nationalism and racism. In some cases in the most extreme form. (Check all the former communist countries) So for all this mess i would blame the communist leaders and specifically Mr.Honxa as concerns Albania who instead of giving Albanians proper education , development and prosperity, he made them the poorest country in Europe and the only official Atheist state in Europe. He like Erdogan of Turkey gave the people myths instead of food, and cultivated the most extreme nationalism. Let's see first what Albanian Academics, professors, Albanologist Historians said: Dr. Kaplan Resuli : Albanologist, academic and Albanian historian- Once even Enver Hoxha was forced to admit that the albanian science lacks scientific objectivity. The albanian poet Mimoza Erebara in the Science Academy asked them directly what was the situation with my scientific discoveries. They had told her: \u201cWe know that very well even before Kaplan, but now is not the time for all of that to be told\u201d Since in the publication \u201cYLBERI\u201d (comes out since 1993, in Geneva) and especially through my albanological collection THE ILLYRIANS AND THE ALBANIANS I demonstrated in written form my points of view, the albanian academic Vincents Golleti, in the printed media stated: \u201cThe stances of Kaplan Burovikj about the albanological problems, especially on the problem of the origin of the Albanians, need to be greeted most warmly, while the studies which he publishes in relation with those problems should be propagated throughout the whole of the scholarly world\u201d. After him followed the albanian scholar Dr. Adrian Qosi who in the middle of Tirana openly opposed the hypothesis about the illyrian origin of the Albanians. With me agreed, via the printed media, several other younger scholars of whom I would especially mention Fatos Ljubonja, Prof. Adrian Vebiu and others. I can say that today appeared a group of new albanian scholars who do not agree with the false myths and courageously accept the scientific truth. I am proud that I lead this group and that they took up from me the necessary scholarly courage. Because, believe me, that is not easy at all, as the extreme albanian nationalists, chauvinists and racists led by Ismail Kadare, through the most severe forms of chicanery and satanising are attempting to silence us at any cost. The mentioned Dr Adrian Klosi when he stated that the hypothesis for the illyrian origin of the Albanians is unfounded, added: \u201cBut it is better not to talk about that because they will declare us anti Albanians\u201d. About the Albanians, Wilkes writes \"NOT MUCH RELIANCE SHOULD PERHAPS BE PLACED ON ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY AN ILLYRIAN ANTHROPOLOGICAL TYPE AS SHORT AND DARK SKINNED SIMMILAR TO MODERN ALBANIANS.\" Wilkes was proven CORRECT by science when the Human Genome Project's Y-chromosome study of European populations, confirmed that the vast majority of contemporary Albanians do not share an Illyrian or any Indo-European lineage. Quote: That's the way it is with our culture, which is mythomaniac, national-communist, romantic, self-glorifying. You can't say anything objective without people getting angry. The Albanians are a people who still dream. That is what they are like in their conversations, their literature...In light of Hoxha and 'pyramid schemes, Albanians are a people who still dream. That's just the way they are...\" Fatos Lubojia - Albanian historian Dr. Kaplan Resuli Commenting on so many ethnic names for the Albanians: That, as well, witnesses the ethnogenesis of the Albanians after their arrival on the Balkan and populating the northern albanian mountains. I have already mentioned about the Illyrians, but the second ethnonym to which they pretend, the Dardanians, it is known, were not Illyrians, but Thracians. Even if they (Dardanians) had been Illyrians, again they haven\u2019t any connection with the Albanians, because that kind of connection neither have the Illyrians themselves. Science has proven that very clearly. In respect of the Albanoi(an)s, they are a celtic tribe which on the territory of Albania, in the region Mat, arrives in the IV century BC. Today\u2019s Albanians, actually, only much, much later take over their name, as have done today\u2019s Bulgarians from the non slavic Bulgars of Asparuh, or today\u2019s French, from the old germanic Franks, deforming the old celtic name Arlbn/Arlbr. Arbanasi is the other name with which our ancestors the \u201cSlavs\u201d are naming them during the Middle Ages. Arnauts is the name which the Turks use for them. It should be known that not all Arnauts were at the same time Albanians, as well. Because the Arnauts (Albanians) got a reputation as good hired hands in the turkish empire, the other mercenaries were also called Arnauts. That means that there were Serbs, Montenegrins and Macedonians ARNAUTS, because some of them are also islamised, thus as muslims they serve under the turkish flag not only as common soldiers, but also as arnauts (mercenaries). Skiptar (or Shiptar and deformed Shiftar, all originate from the albanian appellative Shqipltar) is the current national name of the Albanians, spread amongst them in the XVII-XIX century, influenced by the name Osman, as the Turks were naming themselves. Namely, osman in turkish is \u201ceagle\u201d, while in albanian it is \u201cshquipe\u201d. Thus the Albanians of muslim faith wanted to relate themselves with the muslims Turks, which was also the aim of the Porte, even of the original platform of the Prizren League, which originally is not albanian at all, but pan islamic. And if its primary aims succeeded, most probably the Albanians would not exist today because all of them in the meantime would have become Turks. On the language issue Dr. Kaplan Resuli: - The language question in Albania is not settled even today. Although formally (and by force) Enver Hoxha established as a common, official language the Tosc dialect (until then it was the Gheg dialect), the Ghegs have not given up. They still continue to speak and write in their dialect, although they are persecuted and maltreated because of it. When in 1965 in Albania I published the novel \u201cTreason\u201d in the Gheg dialect the Albanians of northern Albania openly requested the language of this book to be declared as the literary and official language of Albania. That too was one of the reasons for my satanisation which still continues. You should know that the difference between the Tosc and the Gheg dialects is much bigger than the differences between some \u201cslavic\u201d languages, for example the macedonian and the serbian. From another side, more Albanians, about two thirds, speak in gheg, which is lexically richer, purer and also has much greater expressional opportunities. With the enforcement of the tosc dialect, which was of a pure political nature (motive), a crime has been perpetrated against the Albanians and their culture. Question: Recently from Tirana were launched some \u201cevidences\u201d about an existence of 14 million Albanians. Amongst the numerous \u201cAlbanians\u201d who had indebted the world civilisation was included, as well, Alexander of Macedonia!? Dr. Kaplan Resuli : Prof. Dr Skender Rizaj once even in his \u201cscientific\u201d works stated that, also all Serbs, Montenegrins, Macedonians, Bosnians and Herzegovians are, in reality, \u201cslavicised\u201d Albanians. By that method we should \u201cadmit\u201d that they are not only 14, but possibly even 140 millions. I have already published a study about the \u201cscientific\u201d work \u201cThe Illyrians spoke albanian \u2013 The Albanians speak illyrian\u201d published by Preloc Margiljaj. I would like to present for this suitable moment only a few short quotes which can also be found in other albanian historical-linguistic \u201cexperts\u201d: \u201cThe Albanians are one of the oldest nations (peoples) in Europe\u201d (page 438) \u201cit is clear that Crete is the first fireplace of culture and civilisation in the aegean region and in Europe. Crete from the forgotten times of the past was settled with the pelasgian, rather the illyrian or albanian people, thus in Crete ruled the albanian language, which in other words, is the starting point and the first source of the european culture and civilisation\u201d. (page296). Starting from this, this albanian \u201cscientist\u201d wants the albanian language to be taught in all schools around the world as a compulsory language because, according to him, without knowing that language it would not be possible to comprehend the world culture(!?). In respect of Alexander of Macedonia, even Enver Hoxha has written that he is an Albanian, expressing that also in one discussion with the indian ambassador in Tirana, as if personally he, Enver, had sent him to India, even as an ambassador to establish friendly relations between these two countries and peoples. These undoubtedly racist yearnings of the Albanians are certainly the result of their economic and cultural poverty, of their backwardness and late development in comparison with the other nations, amongst which are those of its neighbours, I would say of their frustration because of all of that. Constructed illyrian names in Albania The articles on albania and illyrians related history should all mention that names were constructed and added. They were added during the communist era and thats why they are unacceptable by historians. On the Albanian Claim that they have Illyrian names today ISBN 960-210-279-9 Miranda Vickers, The Albanians Chapter 9. \"Albania Isolates itself\" page 196 it is stated From time to time the state gave out lists with pagan ,supposed Illyrian or newly constructed names that would be proper for the new generation of revolutionaries.(see also Also Logoreci \"the Albanians\" page 157. Check also this article that supports Vickers and Logoreci Austrian Scholars Leave Albania Lost for Words | Balkan Insight The albanian language has thracian affinity . An ancient language of Southern Balkans, belonging to the Satem group of Indo-European. This language is the most likely ancestor of modern Albanian (which is also a Satem language), though the evidence is scanty. 1st Millennium BC - 500 AD. The illyrian languages are larglely unknown and many of the \"illyrian\" tribes spoke non illyrian languages.Veneti were not illyrian indeed they were italic tribes.Epirotes-Macedons were Greek.On illyrians and albanians once if ever the language gets discovered we may find out but up to then will still wander.Albanian nationalism demands to include non illyrians as illyrians(all ancient Hellenes) Linguists recognize an Indo-European Illyrian language, but it is almost entirely known from topographical and personal names. Among the known words are teuta, \"people\", sabaia, \"beer\",note and the name Deipaturus, which is identical to Latin Jupiter and Greek Zeus. So far, there are no Illyrian inscriptions and we have no idea about Illyrian literature. As a consequence, it is not even clear whether Illyrian was one single language or a group of languages. (Until the 1960s, the term was even used to refer to all non-Celtic languages on the western Balkan Peninsula.)

Illyrian or Messapic are just hypothesis that can not be proven.Anyone of course can believe whatever he or she wants.From Claudius Ptolemy, The Geographer to Michael Attaleiates to Anna Komnene we have a lot to say and write but it will take days, so it's better to stop here. Georg von Hahn and Demetrio Camarda prove the Greek origin of the Albanian language and the Greek origin of the Albanians.

            "answer_text": "On one hand, there's almost no evidence about how the ancient Illyrian language sounded like, no lexical remains from ancient writings of that language, so it's practically impossible to prove any direct connection between it and modern Albanian. On the other hand, professional linguists already established a strong connection between Albanian and Romanian, by observing that there's a great number of shared cognates between the two languages. Given that those cognates aren't of Latin origin, even though Romanian is a Romance language, they can only be of ancient Dacian origin (the Dacians lived in what's nowadays Romania, before the Roman conquest of those lands). So, Albanian is rather a half-Latinized Daco-Moesian dialect with a lot of loanwords from Greek, than a descendant of Illyrian. Accordingly, judging from a linguistical/cultural perspective, the Albanians seem to be the descendants of an ancient Daco-Moesian (south-western Dacian) tribe, which migrated to present-day Albania, where, indeed, it mixed with the indigenous Illyrians, who already underwent a process of Hellenization.

There are people playing dumb or making propaganda like Nora Malevolent!!! \u201cThe Arvanitiki or Arvanitic language was spoken by Greek ancestors Pelasgoi thousands of years before the Albanians had their language.\u201d Now listen who ever you are Nora something\u2026 Term: Ipe, Shqipe, Epirot, Shqiptar, Arnaut, Arbanas, Arberor\u00eb, Arbereshe, Arvanit, Arvantitc, Arnaud, Albanian, Dardan , ilir, Etrusc, Pellasg spoke the same language that ALBANIANS nowadays speak!!! I can understand any ancient \u201cGreek\u201d Gege terms by combining them with our subdialects. Current Greek Technical language has no meaning its like learning PHP or C++ or latest LUA programing language!!!

            "answer_text": "Problems with such claims is that romans were very efficient in assimilating conquered people. Illirians were conquered and romanized long time ago. Any trace of illirian language and customs would be lost. So any theory based on language and customs is false. That being said, there is no definitive origin of albanian people, but they do seem to be in balkan peninsula for a very long time. That means they are probably descended from some minor local tribe, illirian, thracian or helenic in origin. I mention \u201cminor\u201d because anything larger than few thousand people would be delt with by the romans. Look at modern romanians, they are desended, mostly, from dacians, an ancient balkan people. They are completely romanised, to the point that they call themselves \u201cromans\u201d, just like byzantine greeks have. ",

            "answer_text": "I love the Greek Antiquity, and knew nothing about the people that lived next to Greece, the Albanians, they have a unique language and share almost the same culture. (This is going to be a bit off topic but I think it\u2019s worth mentioning) I really liked the distinctive Greek ceremonial military uniform called Fustanella, thought it was an original Hellenic uniform but then I found similarities all over Albania, regardless of religion, from south to north with minor differences.  North (Gheg\u00eb) has black or white longer Fustanellas, considering the rough and alpine terrain, and south (Tosk\u00eb) shorter white ones.  (painting by Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me 1867) The word Fustanella used for this kind of kilt that is at least 3000 years old, translates only in today\u2019s Albanian language. Fustanella derives from the word Fustan or Fustani, meaning dress in modern Albanian. I think this is far from being sheer coincidence, and I\u2019m surprised that even historians don\u2019t talk about this. ( I urge everyone to do their own research and not to trust 100% online sources, I may be wrong, even though I traveled to these regions) ",

Anyone can claim anything that suits him/them, but without any proof, it is worthless rubbish. In this case, Albanians are doing this for political reasons, to have some justification for the project of \u201cGreat Albania\u201d. By the way, so what if it is true that they are Illiryan descedants? They lived on some places on Balkans, where now some other nations live. So what? Do Albanians have more rights on some land because of that theory? Serbs were majority on Kosovo for 13 centuries, now they are not. It looks that nobody bothers about that. ",

Now the Vlachs have no territory (they are not Romanians) & became cosmopolitan citizens of the world, assimilating in any state. Only RMacedonia recognises their ethnicity formally. In the Vlach dictionaries/texts, Epirus is considered Vlach \u2018territory\u2019 under Greek/Albanian possession. No political intention, just food for thought. Vlachs weren\u2019t nomads (rather merchants), but enforced to hide in higher/mountainous areas & be mobile. I found some text saying, when some Vlach were robbing rich caravans, they were not killing the Jews as they considered them as brothers (I guess because they were early Christianity adopters). ",
