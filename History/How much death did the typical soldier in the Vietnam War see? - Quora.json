            "answer_text": " CAUTION THE FOLLOWING PHOTOS ARE OF WAR AND DEATH      Above photos off Google We were a tank company with the 11th ACR, an armored cavalry outfit and we saw a lot of combat. We crunched a lot of jungle, did troop support, mine clearing, thunder runs, etc. I was just turning nineteen and I was a combat vet, an old timer. Thinking back, that is so fucking hard to believe. It seemed it was always us, D Co of the 1st Squadron that was called upon. Seemed like it. I remember our TC Maverick throwing his cap in the red dirt of BLACKHORSE Base Camp South of Xuan Loc when he was told to get ready, we were moving out tomorrow. \u201cIs there no other fuckin\u2019 tank company around here? Are we the only ones? My boys are tired, they need a rest for Christ sake! \u201c The LT told him to complain to Colonel Patton, our commander if he didn\u2019t like it. We saw a lot of death in III Corp, a lot. It seemed we were going out every week. Our tanks looked like derelicts. Rusty, worn hulks with dented, bent fenders, broken, missing rad fins, and crews that looked and felt like dead men walking. We only had each other. The only ones important in our little world were the boys we lived with in that steel beast. We were family. Tank warfare in Vietnam. It reminded me of the heavy bomber crews of WWII. Go out on a mission, get the shit shot out of you, come home, then go out and do it all over again. But how many times could you go out and do it before your number came up? We were all a very superstitious lot. Our engines, or packs as we called them, power packs were kept in tip top shape though, to get us into combat, and out of it. We were not. We became immune to dead soldiers, ours or there\u2019s. Ours, waxy, still figures with eyes partly open looking nothing like peaceful, sleeping men. They looked dead, they were dead, partly covered with blood stained ponchos. At first I was stunned by the sight and I could not stop from looking. After, when seeing our dead, my thought would be, \u2018I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not me laying there.\u2019 The enemy dead ripped and torn apart by tank canister and .50 cal machine guns where shredded, ugly, pieces of meat. Legs, torsos, heads, arms. Our tanks did that to them and our thoughts would be, \u2019Better dead than shooting at us.\u2019 We would have no feeling for them at all. They may well have been raccoons laying on the side of a highway. The only time you would experience feeling is if you knew the guy who was dead and laying there. Maybe you shared a smoke, talked about home, or played a prank on him. Now he lay dead and shattered. That hurt, you felt bad, but then you said, \u2019I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not me.\u2019 My mother must absolutely not know what her youngest child was going through here, never. My letters to her were always cheerful and full of lies. I was safe, no worries, my tank guarded the base camp and was not in combat. Sometimes I would cry for lying to my mother like that. But she must never know what her sweet son saw and did. Because she would not be able to take it. When I wrote to my dad, himself a WWII combat vet, I told the truth. I told him never to tell my mom, or my older twin sisters. We, as armored cavalry tankers saw a lot of death. The mind is a funny thing. It helps you, numbs you, spins you into a little cocoon. It protects you from the sights of war. War is a funny thing. One day you are a walking or driving death machine that has little feeling for death. The next day you are getting off a plane in the USA and going home. Wars a funny thing, but not really. ",

            "answer_text": "More than anyone needs to in a lifetime. The Army trains you to ignore death. You don\u2019t shoot someone, you \u201czap\u201d them. You don\u2019t burn men to death, you \u201ccrispy critter\u201d them. There\u2019s a dozen other phrases, but they are all made up to de-humanize the killing. I was in the artillery. The kill radius on a 155 HE shell is 50 meters, everyone within 50 meters is going to die, everyone within 100 meters is going to be adversely affected. I fired thousands of shells. We\u2019d sweep that area after, and do a body count. It was a war of attrition, we were simply trying to kill them all. I\u2019ve killed more men than you\u2019ll meet today. It just seemed like another day at the office. 50 years later, It\u2019s still with me. Every one of those shots happens again in my sleep. We\u2019d set barrels of Foo Gas, jellied gasoline, around our perimeter. Every barrel had an explosive charge under it. If we heard or saw motion at night, we\u2019d pop the Foo Gas and watch the VC dance, burn to death screaming in the flames. We\u2019d wake guys so that they could watch. It\u2019s amazing how small and light a body is after it\u2019s burned for an hour. 50 years ago I could drag one by the foot, laughing when I tried to spin it. Today I think about their souls. Did they have wives and children? How long were they conscious? It\u2019s like Hell itself, and you did it, again and again. I hear every scream and smell every smell over and over, and have for 50 years. Try to avoid such if you can. ",
