            "answer_text": "Hundreds, possibly thousands of Tudor descendants are alive today, including Queen Elizabeth II, her children, and grandchildren. They are related via Margaret Tudor's line. I'm sure there is a spitball figure of living Tudor descendants out there somewhere. The Tudor \u201cdynasty\u201d originated in Wales generations before Henry VII came to power and created the royal House of Tudor. I'd bet there are scores of people descended from the Welsh Tudors walking around today, totally unaware of their lineage. Of the Tudor monarchs, King Henry VII had 3 legitimate children who survived to become parents themselves, in addition to an historically accepted illegitimate son who lived to father children. The most famous of the royal Tudor children, Henry VIII, had 3 surviving legitimate Tudors; none of these produced royal offspring of their own. Henry VIII also formally recognized one illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy, by his mistress Bessie Blount. Sadly, Henry Fitzroy did not live long enough to father children of his own. It is suggested by some historians that Henry VIII fathered one or two illegitimate children with Mary Carey (ne\u00e9 Boleyn), the sister of his second wife Queen Anne Boleyn. Because we don't know with absolute certainty when Henry began or ended his affair with Mary, there is no way to know who fathered her kids. Could have been King Henry, who was as famously jealous and possessive of his mistresses as he was dismissive and cold later. They could have been fathered by her husband William Carey of course, as he had access to (if not the full affections of) his wife. Henry VIII did not recognize these children, (one of whom was male) and they were known by the surname Carey. It is possible Henry VIII felt he could not recognize them even if they were his because of his interest in and desire to marry their aunt Anne Boleyn. We do know that the Carey children grew to adulthood and enjoyed the love of their aunt/half-sister(?) Queen Elizabeth I. This is no firm indication of shared parentage; Elizabeth I was pretty decent to all of her Boleyn relatives. There are some contemporaneous accounts of people remarking on the physical resemblance between Mary Boleyn Carey's kids and Henry VIII, and at least one written account refers to the Carey's son as \u201cthe king's bastard\u201d. Whatever the case, Elizabeth I always referred to them both as cousins. The Carey children went on to have families themselves and were showered with titles, lands, and other signs of royal favor. Some say this is evidence Henry VIII & Elizabeth I knew they were royal bastards, but nobody knows for sure. Apart from the royal and recognized children of the two English Tudor monarchs who had them, it is possible Henry VII and VIII fathered other illegitimate offspring either unknown to or unrecognized by them. These children would not have carried the Tudor name though. In addition, there are some who theorize that Elizabeth I had a secret child who survived to marriage and motherhood, fathered by her youthful love Sir Robert Dudley. Rumor has it this daughter was spirited away in infancy to live a life of safety and normalcy. Hard evidence for this is scarce to non-existent; these are little more than Tudor fanfic type conspiracy theories IMHO. If it is true, the surname the child and her offspring carried forward is lost to history. At any rate, it is entirely possible that your coworker is related to the Tudor family. It is extremely unlikely that this person is a direct descendant of the infamous Henry VIII. ",

            "answer_text": "There are no Tudors of patrilineal descent anymore. That is to say, there are no Tudors who can be traced through the male line of the founder of the dynasty (in this case we\u2019ll start at Henry VII, the first Tudor King). The line of acknowledged Tudor children dies out with Elizabeth I. Henry VIII may have had a male bastard whose line carries on, but not one he recognised as such. However, if we are talking about matrilineal descendants as well then it gets more interesting. In order to form alliances, the Royal families of Europe often married into each other. It is through this that the most obvious descendants of the Tudors alive today would be our current Royal family. Yes, the line may not be the Tudor line, but Henry VIII\u2019s sister, Margeret Tudor married into the Scottish royal line, leading to the Stuarts (starting with James I/VI of Scotland). When the direct Stuart line died out, the throne was passed on to the Hanoverian line through their relation to the Stuarts through James I\u2019s great-grandson, George I. This line lead to Queen Victoria, who married her German cousin Albert, leading to the line of Saxe-Coburg-und -Gotha (name changed to Windsor in 1917). Queen Victoria\u2019s daughters also married into various European royal families, and thus the royal families of Norway, Denmark, Spain, Sweden can also trace their relationship back to the Tudors. Even the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg royal family don\u2019t escape - they\u2019re not Victoria\u2019s direct descendants, but they are the descendants of the Tudors through their relation to George II. Thus, not only are descendants of the Tudors still alive, all the current reigning kings and queens of Europe can trace their ancestry to them. ",
