            "answer_text": "Timbuktu is an ancient city in Mali, 20 km north of the Niger River, at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert in Africa. Historically, the city was a crossroads and an important market place. Timbuktu was metaphorically \u201cthe most distant place imaginable,\u201d as the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) puts it. Why do we know Timbuktu? Its first documented use in this sense is dated to 1863. Phrases that develop this idea include \u201cfrom here to Timbuktu\u201d when describing a very long journey, or \u201cfrom Timbuktu to Kalamazoo\u201d (a city in Michigan, US). Before it was discovered by Europeans in 1830, all documented mentions of Timbuktu are about the efforts to get there, says OED revision editor Richard Shapiro. Even today, when the world has become a much smaller place, it remains relatively remote.
