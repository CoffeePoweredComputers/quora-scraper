            "answer_text": "The most deaths and suffering are caused by tick-borne diseases. This is a very real concern and it is highly recommended to vaccinate yourself if you want to do any kind of outdoor activity off the pavement here.By far the most visibly dangerous animals in Eastern Europe are pet dogs. There are millions of them and the conditions they are kept in are not rigorously regulated nor the regulations enforced. It is the main reason why I stopped doing cycling hikes around my country as it\u2019s nearly impossible to drive 50km by bike in the countryside without being attacked by improperly fenced dogs.Wasps and bees. Not an issue for people who are not allergic to their stings, but a mortal threat to those who are. My friend in the local ER tells me they get quite a lot of stung people with dangerously swollen breathing paths in the summer.Animals infected by rabies. Not as widespread to justify vaccination, but incidents of rabies affected animals biting humans do happen sometimes. This is the only statistically realistic case when a wild large mammal would attack a human. Usually wild animals here have gotten their more adventurous genes bred out of them long ago through centuries of active hunting, the ones that are left rightly avoid humans at all costs.",

            "answer_text": "Wolves and brown bears are European predators that could easily kill humans but they usually avoid people. Wild boar can be very dangerous but they usually only attack when they feel threatened. The most dangerous animals are probably ticks, which can transmit various serious diseases when they bite you.
