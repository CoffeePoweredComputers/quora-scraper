            "answer_text": "Originally, American TDs were not fitted with turret roofs. I think the reasoning behind this was it was better for target acquisition and since the tank destroyer was thought of as a mobile anti-tank gun, a turret roof was not needed. However, this left the crew open to the weather as well as shell fragments from artillery. TD crewmen began improvising turret covers, some from canvas to give protection from weather only, and some fabricated steel roofs that provided some overhead cover from artillery. Eventually Ordnance issued turret roof kits.
