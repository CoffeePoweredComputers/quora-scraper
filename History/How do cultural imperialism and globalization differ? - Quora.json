            "answer_text": "Cultural imperialism? What is that exactly? Some flip side notion that nationalism is wrong and that pluralism and multi-cultural diversity is somehow better in the name of tolerance? And tolerance for what exactly? Maybe it\u2019s not meant that way. Here, we Americans understand one thing unequivocally: Best. That should win every time. And if that\u2019s imperialism. So be it. Best doesn\u2019t care what color you are or gender for that matter. And, if a person doesn\u201dt believe and follow and do the right things then they won\u2019t be the best anyway and so then it won\u2019t really matter anyway. That\u2019s American cultural imperialism at it\u2019s best. Oops said it again. Globalism: Neocolonialism by oligarchical plutocratic transnational forces that seek to turn nations into provincial political economic satrapies in order to further their agenda under the guise of world wide prosperity. But these \u201cprogressive\u201d god-men really have only one agenda which has been, is, and will always be the acquiring maintaining and the furtherance of their power through more and more centralized control. A seat at this table is a seat at this infernal game. A zero sum game where finally at the last there can only be one. Kinda like the movie Highlander. The lowest common denominator is always used and it is always dehumanizing and is always inhumane and is always done by the elites in the name of humanity. Population control anyone? Resource allocation management anyone? Bipedal herd driven rational animals. That is what they want. Call them globalists. Heck call them the matrix for all I care. And they use democratic socialism to placate us and lull us into thinking that we have a voice. And they are aided and abetted by their little scientific techno-mages who tell us that they are working SO HARD for ALL our lives to be better when all they really are doing is making our existences seem easier to us so that they can get control. And the \u201cman\u201d behind the curtain? Well that curtain is pride. And the entity that is on the other side? Well that ain\u2019t no man at all. \u201cLucifer thou art fallen.\u201d ",
