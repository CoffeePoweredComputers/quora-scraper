            "answer_text": "Nate White answered a very simila r question a few years ago. Here\u2019s what he said and he\u2019s spot on, hit the nail on the head, bullseye. This!: A few things spring to mind\u2026 Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace \u2013 all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed. So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump\u2019s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief. Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing \u2013 not once, ever. I don\u2019t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility \u2013 for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman. But with Trump, it\u2019s a fact. He doesn\u2019t even seem to understand what a joke is \u2013 his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty. Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers. And scarily, he doesn\u2019t just talk in crude, witless insults \u2013 he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness. There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It\u2019s all surface. Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront. Well, we don\u2019t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul. And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist. Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that. He\u2019s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat. He\u2019s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege. And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully. That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead. There are unspoken rules to this stuff \u2013 the Queensberry rules of basic decency \u2013 and he breaks them all. He punches downwards \u2013 which a gentleman should, would, could never do \u2013 and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless \u2013 and he kicks them when they are down. So the fact that a significant minority \u2013 perhaps a third \u2013 of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think \u2018Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy\u2019 is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that: Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are. You don\u2019t need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man. This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss. After all, it\u2019s impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; He is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum. God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart. In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws \u2013 he would make a Trump. And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish: \u2018My God\u2026 what\u2026 have\u2026 I\u2026 created?\u2019 If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.

I feel I should point out this marvellous critique of Trump is not my work, I wish it was, but the credit goes to a Nathan White, when I saw this question I immediately thought of Mr Whites words and so reposted it. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.
