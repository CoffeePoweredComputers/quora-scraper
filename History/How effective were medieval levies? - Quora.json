            "answer_text": "Well that depends on the time period, and location. Here are some 9th century Byzantine soldiers  And a viking from the same period  Already there is a huge difference here. The average viking did not wear much for armor. They usually had a metal helmet, a gambeson, a spear, and a shield that was it. He probably would not have a sword though assuming he is a peasant contrary to what this image may show. He would probably have a one-handed axe as his sidearm. Where as among Byzantine soldiers thanks to the wealth of the empire, more of them had access to mail, which was the best armor you could get at that time. And here are two 15th century Bohemian soldiers.  The medieval period was a long period of time, which covers a very diverse geographic location so it is difficult to speak in generalities. I could write an answer about each time period, and major location but that would be way too time consuming. So I will talk about the 15th century primarily western, and central Europe since I am a bit more knowledgeable about this period in the medieval era. Overall levies kind of varied in effectiveness. Their effectiveness would depend on where they came from. Did they come from a large city? A small village? A large castle? etc. I would say that they were generally more effective than levies of previous time periods for the sole reason that they were better equipped, and armored. Every soldier had a gambeson, mail, a helmet, and even some plate on their arms, and a metal gauntlet a lot of the time. Many also wore brigandines on top of this which is a poor man\u2019s plate cuirass. Basically a brigandine was a cuirass with segmented plate not a full plate like a knight\u2019s plate armor, and it had some padding. These were quite effective at stopping arrows, but could still be pierced, or damaged by blunt force weapons like maces, or polarms. Not quite as effective as a knight\u2019s armor but still very good. Levies by this point were starting to become more professional. They still were not trained much, so compared to a medieval knight, a man at arms, or a professional soldier they would still leave much to be desired with regards to fighting skill. With proper maneuvering, and tactics though levies can do very well since individual fighting skill is not as important as discipline, and maintaining your formation. And as I stated earlier it really does greatly depend on the location. Levies from Switzerland used pikes, and were a very potent force on the battlefield. Often times they could stop cavalry charges with relative ease, and the reach of the pike gives them a huge advantage over other infantry. Even if they are not particularly skilled fighters, as long as they maintain cohesion the advantage in weaponry would make up for it. There is a reason why all melee infantry eventually abandoned the spear in favor of pikes, and halberds. Again it depends, the thing to take away is that they were generally only taught the basics, even so levies were nothing to laugh at. They made up the majority of medieval armies, and they were effective enough to play their part on the battlefield. Without them you simply had no army just a couple thousand knights, and professional soldiers maybe if you are lucky. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How effective were medieval levies? Medieval troop levies varied in quality depending on their culture and time period. Levies from the Early Middle Ages (850\u20131066) were generally of poor quality in a feudal society where the upper class\u2014the future knightly class of mounted, armored professionals\u2014monopolized martial duties and often kept the peasantry unarmed because they feared uprisings. The levied troops would be armed with gardening tools, without training, and often poorly led. On the other hand, levies from \u201cbarbarian cultures\u201d would be better. They were be part of a warrior culture and expected to come to the defense of their lands and leaders, and would probably have at least a spear, shield, and helmet. Later in England, in Plantagenet times, all free men were obliged to report to their local sheriff armed at their own expense. The quality of arms depended on the man\u2019s annual incomes, with the truly impoverished being exempt. The poorest who were required to report had to have a spear, shield, and helm; the next level to have a leather cloth gambeson; and so on, up to the wealthy who had to come with a horse, armor, spear, sword. At first they were expected to go wherever the king ordered them, but eventually they were only required to report for defense of the realm. They also underwent training, and lists were kept by the sheriffs. Thus they would have been better than the earlier peasant levies, but not as good as experienced and well equipped mercenaries or retinues. Eventually most English free men were required to train regularly with the long bow. Many were drafted or volunteered for the army overseas, and when they returned would be experienced and effective members for the home defense. ",
