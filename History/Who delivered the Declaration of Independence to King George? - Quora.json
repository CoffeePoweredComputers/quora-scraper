            "answer_text": "No-one. The Declaration was never sent by the Congress to King George of England. He found out about it when printed broadsheets containing the text arrived with the news from the colonies. These were first printed in Belfast in August of 1776 and carried from there to London immediately afterwards. Of course, the British had many spies and sympathizers in the Congress and they undoubtedly knew of the whole progress of the Declaration which began in the spring of 1776. So, secretly George would have known of the text relatively quickly. ",
