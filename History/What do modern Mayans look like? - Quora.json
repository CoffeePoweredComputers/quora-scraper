            "answer_text": "I'm kind of the wrong person to ask because one of the other topics I write about is prosopagnosia (face blindness) because I can't recognize faces. So my skills at detecting differences in faces is suspect. Interestingly, when living among Mayans I didn't seem to suffer the \u201cother race\u201d effect. I learned to tell Mayans apart in the same amount of time using the same strategies as I do for CaucasIons But I digress. Some modern Mayans (or Maya) remind me very strongly of ancient depictions of Mayans. Some look more Latin or even Asian. Try googling \u201cMaya Kiche\u201d and looking at the images. ",
