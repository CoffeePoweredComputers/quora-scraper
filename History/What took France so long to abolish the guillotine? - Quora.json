            "answer_text": "La Guillotine wasn't abolished. The death penalty was. In 1981. The last execution took place in 1977, of a man who had tortured a young woman to death. To answer the question now, the death penalty was abolished in France for several reasons. First of all, it used to be public. The reasoning behind that was that people should see justice in action. That was changed because the public was a little bit too enthusiastic at watching real-life gore, up until the 1930s. Then it became for a while \u201csemi-public\u201d, in that the authorities would block the streets in front of the prison. My grandfather, who grew up in front of a prison, had to go to school the long way round when there was an execution. Little by little, the French public became wary of this, unsurprisingly after WW2 when the German occupiers executed a lot of people themselves. Capital punishment moved from for murder, to murder with barbarism. That means a heinous murder, with torture, or against a child. It was finally the \u201caffair of the red pullover\u201d that was the turning point. A man was condemned to be decapitated, but enough doubt existed that he might not be the guilty one. It occurred just before an election, and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand won. One of his promises was to end the death penalty. Despite the fact that a slight majority of the population was still in favour of it, it was abolished. It was a political promise that was kept. So the guillotine was abolished because the death penalty was, and that was abolished because enough people voted for a party that had abolishment in its manifesto. For those who wish to see the last used guillotine, it is in the Museum of Mediterrean and European Civilization (MuCEM) in Marseille. ",

            "answer_text": "The man who invented it was named Dr. Gillotine and he knew this was a far more humane way to execute people who were tried and sentenced by the state. The problem became that the state devolved into a small group of dissidents that hated Royalty, Catholics and Nobility and it was used on them with passion. The problem was they were show trials or really just accusations that got processed in under an hour ruling life and death with no legal mandate. The guillotine was used against every faction in power once the next govt took power and so even Maximillian Robespierre who oredered the deaths of up to 50,000 people was ordered to be put to death by the guillotine\u2026. The machine only does what those in power wanted that's the problem: power. Once they realized power corrupts and the mob is NOT justice, something Americans are learning now with their cancel culture - power does not make someone correct - the French ended the machine! Napoleon knew better and tried to use power against foreign powers instead of their own people and that became way more popular for France. In the end both powers were wrong, Trump is not right and CHAZ is not right and once America figures that out progress can be made\u2026 ",

However, just as it was being debated, there was a particularly gruesome rape and murder going through the courts. The perpetrator was found guilty, and was sentenced to death . If the bill had passed, he would have been spared. A particularly fierce campaign to retain the death penalty was started in newspapers by supporters of the death penalty because of this; it swayed public opinion and the votes of the Parliament, which then voted against the abolition by a majority of 100 votes.

Fifty-three countries around the world retain the death penalty on their statute books.

The guillotine was the means to ensure that all necks were cut the same way. Unlike \u201cuser dependent\u201d techniques such as decapitatoin by sword or axe, hanging, shooting, electric chair, or poisoning, the guillotine almost never fails. And decapitation death is, even if not painless, then at least quick with unconsciousness within ten or twenty seconds.  This is, of course, quite different from the American way, that uses ALL OTHER common means of execution, except decapitation. And except burning at the stake. Probably because the blood shooting out from the arteries of the severed neck is messy. ",

He recruited a couple of local people and asked if there was anyone in the Islands not loyal to the government? They guillotined him (a verb). That got everyone on the island afraid of him and turning in their neighbors. He chops off a few hundred heads and goes to the next island. He did this for years and had a regular circuit through the French held islands. Everyone was afraid that if they didn\u2019t turn in their neighbors, their neighbors would turn them in. In the end, he killed over 10,000 people. He was also sleeping with any woman that he wanted. If she didn\u2019t comply, their boyfriends or husbands would end up on the chopping block (literally). In the end, he died of old age (about 90) back in France. Mitchner tells it much better than I did, and he goes into a lot more detail if you are interested. ",
