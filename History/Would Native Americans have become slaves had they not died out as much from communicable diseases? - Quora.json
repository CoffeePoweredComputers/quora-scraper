            "answer_text": "Considering the extent to which they were enslaved before, during, and after the decimation of their populations by recently arrived diseases, the answer is absolutely yes. The only reason enslaved Africans were brought over is because the natives were dying too fast. Their knowledge of the local environment was also a deterrent, but that was easily solved by shipping them far way, like the Puritans did in the aftermath of King Philip\u2019s War in the 1670s. Any of the justifications for enslaving Africans came after the fact; the real reason was economic necessity. No one would have paid to ship people from the other side of the ocean if there were enough people there already. This is seen in the Spanish encomienda system, particularly in Mexico, where natives became, essential, serfs (somewhat oversimplified, but a closer approximation than chattel slavery as seen in the US).

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, yes. This is because, first, the Europeans needed labor. They couldn\u2019t go back home and ask who wants to do manual labor when the natives would be just as capable or even more because working in plantations and mining were such lowly jobs, that the native Americans who they viewed as inferior would do. Then, as it turns out, they have abismally low immunity to diseases from Europe, and therefore useless. But the Africans, who they can get from the slave trade very cheaply were immune, which they knew from experience. So the Africans were convenient for hard labor. ",
