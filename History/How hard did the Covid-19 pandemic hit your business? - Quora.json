            "answer_text": "As a small business owner in tier 3 city, the Corona pandemic has hit a jolt by hampering the cash flow as it is entirely dependent on day to day selling of goods and services. The total lockdown has hampered cash flow, and during 50+ days lockdown savings vanished. It also has vanquished the customer's willingness to buy goods for there nearing or future events, ceremonies, and celebrations in 2020. Uncertainty prevails for health threats in the covid19 situation and the number of people contaminated increasing rapidly has also created chaos in residents. Which is not going to end unless and until proper vaccination is not available of the corona. The overall influence of 70% to our YOY business figures is the impact during 2 months of unlocking months (adding the impact of 2 months of complete lockdown is devastating as well). Which is shocking and unable to compensate in the coming year 2020\u201321. Frankly, none of us are prepared for the pandemic and we shall overcome with permanent scars. It will be a blessing if we don't have to face a loss of life in the family. God bless India ",
