            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a great book which goes into some detail about this subject. Check out Genghis Khan, by John Man.  It can\u2019t be said that it was one particular thing that did it, nor a battle, or two. Infact, it was neither. To fully appreciate what happened you have to go back to the start and study the growth and expanse of both groups. When these forces of history finally came together they did so over a number of years, decades even, with and without incident. They traded goods with one another, learned each others tongues, and at times, lived and travelled together. It can seem, by not reading too much about it, as though it was some great unholy collision that took place, but the truth is, and almost always happens to be, far more dull. Yes, there were incidents and altercations, and there was blood. But we seem to make a bigger thing of that now than they did in those days. Things changed quicker then; land, chiefs, lords. Adapting was far more a way of life for them, as well as a way of surviving, then most of us have need for today. The history of what happened between the Mongols and Muslims is not one untold throught the ages, many times; warfare is costly, extremely costly. People get tired of fighting. Influences overide cultures, and new ways of thinking develop across borders. Often, but not always, the more established and enlightened way succeeds. But it did so organically. The mongols never ran from the Muslims defeated. The Muslims never surrendered to the invaiding Tartar hordes. Those incidents may have taken place, but sporadically, never thoroughly as successions of one completely over another. They merely happened here and there. Someone became overseer of an outskirt city or village and then things went back to normal. Then someone took it back, maybe. Inbetween, the farmer farmed, the breadmaker made bread, the mother suckled her young and the lamb leapt about in the field until it was time for dinner. Maybe you are looking for a hero? Perhaps you imagined some great warrior inspiring the faithfull to take arms against a sea of barbarians, and by opposing, ended them. There might have been a scuffle like that which took place. But it wouldn\u2019t be the wholesale answer you were after for your question. No, ultimately, the Mongols just calmed down, generally speaking, everywhere. And life went on, for everyone. Edit: with an extension to my answer from the author of the above book, Mr John Man. I emailed him to get his thoughts on my answer and he was kind enough to reply: The Muslims could not resist the invasion, and did nothing much to end Mongol rule. All they had to do was remain Muslim, and rely on the strength of their culture. The Mongols had no agenda other than their own survival - no religion, art, literature, or philosophy to share - and they just dissipated, like the remnants of a great explosion. Great guy. Great book. ",

            "answer_text": "Saying that Muslims stopped the Mongols is not quite true. The only one who stopped the Mongols were Memluks. Memluk Sultanate was a Turkic State founded by mostly Turks and some other nations. I didn\u2019t say all the nations because there were lots of nations in Memluk Army. They were great soldiers and they stopped Mongols twice. One on Elbistan and the other on Ayn Callut. First, they defeated them in 1260, Ayn Callut. They outnumbered the Mongols and they won the war. Second one was the Battle of Elbistan. Mongols were more than them but they defeated them and considering the relatively low casualties, it was a heroic victory. I have to say that their commander, Baybars was a great commander. Under his rule, Memluks were the strongest state on the Middle East. Now, let\u2019s talk about the reason why they defeated the Mongols while others can\u2019t. Mongols beat almost all the states they fought with and most of these victories thanks to Subutai, one of the best commanders the world had ever seen. He died in 1248 and were not involved in both these wars. On the other hand, Memluks had the best commander in their history in Battle of Elbistan. Memluk Army\u2019s commander was Seyfettin Kunduz(this is in Turkish, I don\u2019t know what others call him) , another great commander. You said Muslims but considering all other Muslim states, Mongols burned down almost all of them. They defeated the Anatolian Seljuks, Kharzem Shahs, Arabs. They even killed the Khalifa and his all sons but one. Considering these facts, saying that Muslims stopped the Mongols doesn\u2019t seem so true and I am telling this as a Muslim. I would like to say that Muslims defeated them , but they couldn\u2019t. ",
