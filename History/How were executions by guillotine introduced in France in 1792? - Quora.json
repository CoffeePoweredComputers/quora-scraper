            "answer_text": "It was, perhaps surprisingly, an aspect of the French Revolution\u2019s desire to be egalitarian. Under the monarchy, ordinary people were executed by hanging (usually quite slowly, by strangulation), while members of the nobility were beheaded with a sword - a kindness as it was much quicker. The revolutionaries decreed that all executions should be by decapitation - they didn\u2019t think nobles should get special treatment, and they didn\u2019t approve of making the condemned person suffer as an entertainment for the crowd. The public executioner then decided to have a guillotine built (the idea had been put forward some time before), partly because he felt it would be more reliable, but also because he felt that using a sword had too many connections to the nobility. After the first execution by guillotine (of a common criminal) the crowd apparently called for the gallows to be restored - they felt that they didn\u2019t get the amount of entertainment that expected: they preferred to see someone hang and suffer for a while, rather than a quick death.
