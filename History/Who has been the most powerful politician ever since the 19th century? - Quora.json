            "answer_text": "Oh dear!! Too tough question to answer. There are many I guess. But let me tell you one thing clearly. There will be as many people from the \"Third world\" as there are from the western countries in the list. This is because it was in the 19 th century that the \"Third world\" countries and its people realized how freedom and self rule was vital for their future generations. That is from where great leaders were born. And those were the people from whom few great politicians were carved out.  Let me give you a small list here mainly about the \"third world\" countries.Starting from the \"Che Guevera\" to the \"Nelsa Mandela\" (leader not a politician) to the \"Mahatma Gandhi\"(Once again a leader) to the \"Jawaharlal Nehru\" etc. I am sorry I dont remember many but I am sure there are many. Thanks for the A2A. ",
