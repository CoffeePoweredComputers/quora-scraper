            "answer_text": "::Why was Brazil made into an empire instead of a kingdom (independent of Portugal)?:: It was due to what could be described as a nomenclature issue. When the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil & Algarve was dissolved, Dom Pedro I took the title of Emperor to further disassociate the Brazilian Crown from the Portuguese one, which still used the title of King. And it may look silly to us, but back at the time, it was also fashionable to declare oneself Emperor, after Napoleon: it\u2019s not coincidence that the First Mexican Empire was proclaimed in 1821 and the Empire of Brazil in 1822.

            "answer_text": "The rational behind Brazil becoming an Empire and not a Kingdom under Dom Pedro I, was due to its vast territorial extension and to the huge number of different peoples that lived inside its boundaries. Even today, more than 180 languages are spoken in Brazil. Napoleon may have started the fad, but Brazil fitted the description of an Empire at the time. Was it pretentious? Yes! But not inaccurate.
