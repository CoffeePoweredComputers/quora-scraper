            "answer_text": "Why don't soldiers kill dictators? The same reason people don\u2019t kill presidents, priests, bank managers and others. Because they believe that it is not the right way to go. Because they believe that it would be murder and murder is wrong. Because they believe that it would set a bad precedent - what if everyone killed leaders they don\u2019t like? What if someone killed me because they didn\u2019t like me? Because they believe in the same values the dictator has. Because they believe the dictator is helping their people and country. Because they may believe that having a dictator is what is needed to counter certain hostile activity by another country and ideology. Because they have pledged to protect the dictator. Because they revere the dictator. What is a dictator anyway? It is an insult aimed at another country\u2019s leader that you\u2019re hostile with. You never call your friendly countries leaders \u201cdictators\u201d. It\u2019s the same as with the term oligarch. All Western Democracies tend to be ruled by an oligarchy - you need to join the exclusive ring of political and economic elite to have any chance to gain power since that ring holds all the power and is de facto oligarchy. Even oligarchs can be populist in that they can try to do things that they think people will support and want to have done. Same for dictators. A dictator can create jobs, can protect the people and offer health care, all sorts of nice that people will be happy with. A dictator can tackle drug problem, can help orphans. There\u2019s nothing saying that a dictator can\u2019t do these things. Furthermore, a dictator can punish capitalists that are being cruel to their workers, a dictator can punish criminals when there isn\u2019t sufficient evidence but everyone knows that they are the criminals. Think of a cartel leader - everyone knows a person is leading a drug cartel but courts cannot touch him - but the dictator can just send in a strike force to take him out or arrange a mock court hearing where the outcome is predetermined. Meanwhile a president of a democratic country can be democratically elected but can after elections betray all the promises made during elections, betraying the people who voted him. He can then be a tyrant for the remainder of his term doing whatever he pleases. Say, a president or prime minister promises that education and health care won\u2019t be cut - but as soon as is elected cuts them severely and instills social Darwinian policies he claimed to oppose. But that\u2019s not the full length of the story. Elected politicians we can change unless they seize the power and become dictators, refusing to step down. Dictators, we can\u2019t change them. If we have one dictator who is doing great things for his people we will not know who will succeed him. It could be his psychopathic spoiled sadist of a child who has radical extreme views on things and just wants to use power, regardless of consequences just to see himself using power. So whether you live in a democracy or in a dictatorship, you can be at the exact same position - unable to have any influence over the policies of your leaders or able to do so, with good or bad policies being applied from your perspective. Even living in a democratic country can mean that your political ideas can be repressed. For instance communist parties have been often forbidden in some democratic countries. Opposition to globalism could see that there are no politicians willing to drive anti-globalist cause and so on. Democracy itself can at worst be tyranny of the majority and the majority can sometimes be 55%. Simply, there is no black and white. We live in a complex world where it\u2019s difficult to see the possible outcomes of your actions. Some actions can have drastic unforeseen and unwanted consequences. ",

            "answer_text": "Dictator usually have 3 generals so what will happen: You are average soldier that decided to kill EVIL dictator. you get caught and tortured and raped and then killed. If you could escape you could have done it without killing dictator. Does country becomes better after your sacrifice? NO best case scenario one of 3 generals takes over and continues to do the same. Worst case scenario 3 generals start to fight civil war against each other meaning even more dead people. You are one of those generals and decided to kill general and take over his role. you have to kill other 2 generals to be sure they dont gather their army and attack you. You have to kill his body guards(special forces unit usually) because they are really loyal. Also there are regular units wanting to revenge or take your new spot. So in this case you cant just kill dictator. You must have small army loyal to you and it is hard to gather such force without anyone noticing. but it does happen.  So military coups do happen but by killing just one man it doesnt change anything. ",
