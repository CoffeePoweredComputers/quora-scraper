            "answer_text": "I am sure all the answers here are just fine. Perhaps, I could add that, although the Austro-Hungarian Alliance was eager to attack & punish Serbia, it didn\u2019t work out that way: the Serbs kicked their arrogant butts all over the Balkans, resulting in a humiliated Austrian force skulking home in a few months with greatly reduced numbers. This left Germany to fight on against \u2018the World\u2019, as Norm MacDonald so eloquently expresses it in his famous bit .  Ironically, if the Kaiser had allowed Austria-Hungary to sally forth without a guarantee of military support, it would have all been over in a few months and the world would be a vastly different place today.

            "answer_text": "It was an excuse for the Germanic Austro-Hungarian Empire to try and bring down the Slavic Serbian Kingdom and incorporate it and other Balkan States into its imperial structure. The Austro-Hungarians were backed by the German Empire, and the Serbs were backed by the Russian Empire. When Austro-Hungary declared war on Serbia the Russian\u2019s mobilized their reserves. This triggered the German Empire to mobilize their reserves. What the Kiser did not realize was this set in motion an automatic attack on Russia\u2019s ally, France, to knock it out before it could mobilize and attack Germany. The Archduke\u2019s assassination set a series of events in motion that triggered World War I. ",
