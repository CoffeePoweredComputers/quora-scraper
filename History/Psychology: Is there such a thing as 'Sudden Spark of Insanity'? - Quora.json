            "answer_text": "Let's look at the etymology of \"insanity\" first. According to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th Edition, insanity is defined as:   n. Mental illness or derangement. No longer in scientific use.n. Law Unsoundness of mind sufficient in the judgment of a civil court to render a person unfit to maintain a contractual or other legal relationship or to warrant commitment to a mental health facility.n. Law In most criminal jurisdictions, a degree of mental malfunctioning sufficient to relieve the accused of legal responsibility for the act committed.n. Extreme foolishness; folly.n. Something that is extremely foolish.What would cause calling someone \"insane\" in everyday life? There are only 2 main reasons in my view: A difference in intelligence between people, usually accompanied by a difference in education and knowledge.A Personality Disordered person or a small circle of PD people who are crazy-making others. More specifically, that disorder would be Narcissistic Personality Disorder.Each case in detail For statement no 1 It is usually the more stupid, ignorant and uneducated who call the more intelligent people insane. One reason is that those people do not even know what \"insane\" means, nor do they know of any other more specific words, terms, explanations, or even simple ways to describe this \"insanity\" they are talking about. If the more intelligent get into ad hominems, they will generally use the words stupid, ignorant, uneducated, foolish or idiots. But if you ask me, the line between stupididty and insanity is fine. In another definition by Albert Einstein, insanity is \"doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\". And if you study everyday life more closely, you will see that the world is full of people who do just that: repeating the same behaviours and actions again and again, while at the same time moaning about their (bad) results. How else could they be called other than ... ABSOLUTELY INSANE, TERMINALLY ILL MONKEYS IN HUMAN COSTUMES!!!  But I'd better get hold of myself... To a more important question Is there some scientific way to explain this phenomenon of incomprehension on a cognitive basis? Yes. 1. IQ difference Some research shows that friends and spouses have an average IQ difference of 12 points, that for IQ differences less than 20 points a reciprocal intellectual relationship is the rule, for IQ differences between 20-30 points the intellectual relationship tends to be one way, and that IQ differences greater than 30 points tend to create real barriers to communication. The latter is part of research by Leta Hollingworth, an American psychologist who conducted pioneering work in the early 20th century. As she writes in the book \"Children above 180 IQ\": A lesson which many gifted persons never learn as long as they live is that human beings in general are inherently very different from themselves in thought, in action, in general intention, and in interests. Many a reformer has died at the hands of a mob which he was trying to improve in the belief that other human beings can and should enjoy what he enjoys. This is one of the most painful and difficult lessons that each gifted child must learn, if personal development is to proceed successfully. It is more necessary that this be learned than that any school subject be mastered. Failure to learn how to tolerate in a reasonable fashion the foolishness of others leads to bitterness, disillusionment, and misanthropy. It should be noted however that this book is from 1942. Today there is a lot more information available as well as newer research being made, so that even the concept of IQ is challenged a lot. 2. The Dunning-Kruger effect The Dunning\u2013Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which relatively unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than it really is. Dunning and Kruger have postulated that the effect is the result of internal illusion in the unskilled, and external misperception in the skilled: \"The miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.\" To understand this in everyday life, simply imagine if one is discussing with another person, and that person constantly but incorrectly believes that they understand what they are talking about. Now think of this happening repeatedly in every single interaction. It will soon become obvious that the 2 will not be able to communicate with one another because they will have totally different understanding of events. For statement no 2 Narcisissts (and of psychopaths in some context) are the grandaddys of crazy-making, which they do either by directly telling others they are crazy, or from the effect of their inconsistent behaviour against them which makes them feel confused. But it is in fact the narcissists who are \"insane\", as NPD is indeed a mental illness.  And according to the latest study, the prevalence of NPD in the general population of the US is 6.2%. This basically means that 1 in 16 people are narcissists, which is much more than commonly assumed, and coming across a narcissist in everyday life happens more frequently than expected. There is a good article about crazy-making on Psychologytoday by Kimberly Key, past division president of the American Counseling Association and author of Ten Keys to Staying Empowered in a Power Struggle. If you are across people who either call you \"crazy\" or who either make you feel like you are \"crazy\" from the ways in which they behave, this is an article to read. How to Handle a Crazymaker  Anosognosia Moreover, there a condition called \"anosognosia\" which comes together with narcissism. Anosognosia is the impaired awareness of a person experiencing a psychiatric illness. Narcissists have limited self-awareness, and do not think there is anything wrong with them. In fact it is so bad that they reverse any kind of assumption of them being ill and blame others about their behaviour. Humoristically, the behaviour and partly the anosognosia of a narcissist can be seen in this scene from The Monty Pythons film \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\"   To conclude to the question, if OTHERS believe that you are insane, it is likely that one of the 2 is happening: You are more intelligent / or those others are idiots, depending on how one wants to word this ORThe others have a personality disorder, most likely NPDBut to be on the safe side: Do you feel like you are insane in any way? And I don't mean emotionally confused. And do you think that those others are may be a little insane as well? This is important to help you understand where you stand. The very fact of wondering if one is insane gives the most important clue about it: if one is aware of how they are, and thus do not suffer from anosognosia, they are well enough to be considered sane to a great extent.
