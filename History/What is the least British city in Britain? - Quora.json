            "answer_text": "Not entirely sure what your question means. The use of the word \u2018least\u2019 is a little imprecise. I\u2019m assuming you are thinking of a typical city as being a large urban centre so asking about cities which don\u2019t comply with that definition. The use of the term \u2018city\u2019 in the UK is a little more complex than elsewhere. Originally it meant a settlement which had a cathedral. Anywhere, whatever it\u2019s size that didn\u2019t have a cathedral was a town, not a city. What this has resulted in is a number of often very small places which are cities. Essentially they are places with cathedrals which have not grown since medieval times. Two good examples in Wales are St Davids and St.Asaph. Both are no more than villages with populations under 2000. In England there aren\u2019t cities that small but a number of places no bigger than small towns which are cities. Examples are Wells in Somerset, Ely in Cambridgeshire, Southwell in Nottinghamshire and Ripon in North Yorkshire. In other words size doesn\u2019t matter. It does result in some curios comparisons. A further complication is that, on the one hand, some large towns which don\u2019t have cathedrals have been granted city status while some towns which have had cathedrals established during the 20th century, such at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, have not been granted city status. This does result in some curious comparisons and much civic angst and jealousy. Norwich, in Norfolk, for instance has two cathedrals and has always been a city. Ipswich, in neighbouring Suffolk and the same size as Norwich has no cathedral and hasn\u2019t been granted city status so is merely a town! So it is rather complicated in a typical British way. I\u2019m not sure of the situation in Scotland but think it may be similar. The big difference in Scotland is that most of the medieval cathedrals were destroyed at the Reformation or even earlier.

            "answer_text": "Even though he may be a QPP contributor, the OP has managed to ask an interesting question. Those who ask; \u201cBut what do you mean by \u2018British\u2019\u201d (and stop there) surely miss the point - that any answer needs to address that aspect of the question, as well as considering things like the differing definitions of \u201ccity\u201d in the USA and in the UK, the inhabitants\u2019 nationality, ethnicity and culture, or the city\u2019s history and architecture. The UK, quite obviously, is a mixture which includes some places which are highly British but nevertheless unusual or even unique. There\u2019s only one London - in just the same way as there\u2019s only one Paris or Vienna. There aren\u2019t many in which you might hear Welsh spoken - but that doesn\u2019t make places in Wales any less British. Only one official city can be the largest. Or the smallest - whether by area or by population. Among the nominations, I favour Portmeirion, on the grounds that it\u2019s anything but an organic development. Milton Keynes, likewise - if less extreme. Or Slough which, when you drive through it, might appear to have been constructed to ape an American mid-western city from some Hollywood movie. The Prince of Wales\u2019s creations have a similar air about them, architecturally; places which didn\u2019t just grow, but have been created. Yet that\u2019s not as modern as you might think. Bedford Park (in Chiswick, West London) is claimed as the world's first garden suburb and dates from the Victorian era. Parts of Croydon - if you just observe from a bus - look like a transplant from South Asia or Africa. Other parts look like (in fact, are) large municipal housing estates - of typically British appearance. Others are composed of 1930s spec-built semis and bungalows - also quite typically British. There are even some leafy neighbourhoods in which the houses are hidden behind high hedges and gates - and you can tell how wealthy they are by the lack of cars parked on the street. (They have all the parking space they need inside those gates.) And, again, modern trams lend a continental flavour to a few streets. Right now, the centre of Croydon is being disfigured (many might say that\u2019s an impossibility) by enormous new tower blocks. (Let\u2019s hope the authorities that oversee building works and maintenance, and the fire services, have learned their lessons \u2026) All things considered, I\u2019d claim Croydon - on grounds of its diversity - as a most British city. Find a place where little or nothing has changed (or the nearest to that) and, maybe, it could be your least British city. ",
