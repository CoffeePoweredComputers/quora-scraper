            "answer_text": "I would not say that Hegel\u2019s philosophy is \u2018so popular\u2019 everywhere and all the time, as it has its ups and downs of popularity. If it is popular, like other schools and -isms for example Marxism, Wittgenstein, Phenomenology, etc, in certain areas and periods there are social and cultural reasons and explanations for it. The far reaching influence of Hegel is due in a measure to the undoubted vastness of the scheme of philosophical synthesis which he conceived and partly realized. A philosophy which undertook to organize under the single formula of triadic development every department of knowledge, from abstract logic up to the philosophy of history, has a great deal of attractiveness to those who are metaphysically inclined. But Hegel's influence is due in a still larger measure to two extrinsic circumstances. His philosophy is the highest expression of that spirit of collectivism which characterized the nineteenth century. In theology especially Hegel revolutionized the methods of inquiry. The application of his notion of development to Biblical criticism and to historical investigation is obvious to anyone who compares the spirit and purpose of contemporary theology with the spirit and purpose of the theological literature of the first half of the nineteenth century. In science, too, and in literature, the substitution of the category of becoming for the category of being is a very patent fact, and is due to the influence of Hegel's method. In political economy and political science the effect of Hegel's collectivistic conception of the State supplanted to a large extent the individualistic conception which was handed down from the eighteenth century to the nineteenth century. Hegelian schools Main articles: Hegelian Rightists and Young Hegelians Hegel's philosophy became known outside Germany from the 1820s onwards, and Hegelian schools developed in northern Europe, Italy, France, Eastern Europe, America and Britain. [3] These schools are collectively known as post-Hegelian philosophy, post-Hegelian idealism or simply post-Hegelianism. [4] In Germany Hegel's immediate followers in Germany are generally divided into the \"Right Hegelians\" and the \"Left Hegelians\" (the latter also referred to as the \"Young Hegelians\"). The Rightists developed his philosophy along lines which they considered to be in accordance with Christian theology. They included Johann Philipp Gabler, Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz, and Johann Eduard Erdmann. The Leftists accentuated the anti-Christian tendencies of Hegel's system and developed schools of materialism, socialism, rationalism, and pantheism. They included Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Bruno Bauer, and David Strauss. Max Stirner socialized with the left Hegelians but built his own philosophical system largely opposing that of these thinkers. Other nations See also: Neo-Hegelianism In Britain, Hegelianism was represented during the nineteenth century by, and largely overlapped the British Idealist school of James Hutchison Stirling, Thomas Hill Green, William Wallace, John Caird, Edward Caird, Richard Lewis Nettleship, F. H. Bradley, and J. M. E. McTaggart. In Denmark, Hegelianism was represented by Johan Ludvig Heiberg and Hans Lassen Martensen from the 1820s to the 1850s. In mid-19th century Italy, Hegelianism was represented by Bertrando Spaventa. Hegelianism in North America was represented by Friedrich August Rauch and William T. Harris, as well as the St. Louis Hegelians. In its most recent form it seems to take its inspiration from Thomas Hill Green, and whatever influence it exerts is opposed to the prevalent pragmatic tendency. In Poland, Hegelianism was represented by Karol Libelt, August Cieszkowski and J\u00f3zef Kremer. Benedetto Croce and \u00c9tienne Vacherot were the leading Hegelians towards the end of the nineteenth century in Italy and France, respectively. Among Catholic philosophers who were influenced by Hegel the most prominent were Georg Hermes and Anton G\u00fcnther. Hegelianism also inspired Giovanni Gentile's philosophy of actual idealism and fascism, the concept that people are motivated by ideas and that social change is brought by the leaders. Hegelianism spread to Imperial Russia through St. Petersburg in the 1840s, and was \u2013 as other intellectual waves were \u2013 considered an absolute truth amongst the intelligentsia, until the arrival of Darwinism in the 1860s. [5] Slavoj \u017di\u017eek is considered to be a contemporary post-Hegelian philosopher. [6] See also Dialectical phenomenologyHegelian MarxismPanlogism",

            "answer_text": "It is? Hegel is fantastically difficult. I taught a graduate seminar on the Phenomenology of Spirit once upon a time. We got about 120 pages in. He's great, but seriously Continental, as classified, and Anglo-American departments tend not to staff him seriously. The grad program where I got my PhD, one of the top 5 in US, did not have a Hegel scholar other Hegel scholars took seriously when I started, then hired one, who was mainly a Kant scholar, and fired her because she was a woman, black, did Hegel. At the grad program where I taught, I was the Hegel person, not my main thing. Marx is my main thing. They fired me too. ",
