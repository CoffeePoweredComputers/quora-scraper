            "answer_text": "The grand slam was a penetrator meant to explode underground or in the bowels of a ship it hit. The shockwave was used to create a mini-earthquake to destroy structures. MOAB is a surface explosive used for its blast/shock-wave and fireball to engulf its target. It works wonders when used against cave and building complexes ",

            "answer_text": "Massive Ordance Air Blast = GBU-43/B MOAB AIR Blast is the key difference. The MOAB detonates several hundred feet above the ground for maximum effect in a large diameter of surface area. Massive Ordnance Penetrator is the US modern version of the British Grand Slam of WWII. PENETRATOR is the key difference here as it does not detonate its large secondary explosive charge until its primary explosive charge has made a hole in the bunker, earth, rock, mountain, etc. ",
