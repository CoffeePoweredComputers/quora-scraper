            "answer_text": "Amerindians were no more unanimous in their methods of selecting leaders than Europeans were. \u201cChief\u201d was not an actual term or role in the vast majority of Amerindian societies. War leaders, discussion leaders, camp leaders and society leaders were the most outstanding individuals chosen by consensus. Voting did not take place; rather, those who disagreed with the group position or attitude were free to stand/sit aside or leave the band. Itinerant Plains tribes tended to have one type of organization for travelling, as they followed the game or migrated to displace other tribes. Warrior \u201csocieties\u201d existed with members chosen for courage and reliability which took turns acting as road guides, supervising the movement, chivvying stragglers, guarding against attacks, enforcing travel rules and hunting game for the journey. Other leaders would take over when settlements were established, until the next change of location. War leaders were warriors who could enlist sufficient followers to make a raid. Successful raids earned prestige, so more might join them the next time. Amerindians were unbelievably independent and headstrong. Raid organizers had the greatest difficulty persuading their recruits of the moment to cooperate in ambushes. Almost every time, some young buck would break the secrecy of the ambush with a premature attack so he could be the first to win the fame and glory of striking the initial blow. Group reputation that established whether others would respect and follow you was established by proven proficiency in a valued skill like warfare or hunting or oratory. Note that many early historians of Native Indian life who lived among bands for months at a time noted the \u201cun-European\u201d practices that prevailed. Women did all the camp work, while men laid about idly or jumped into frantic hard activity to hunt game or engage in a raid against a rival tribe. Camps were easily found by their foul smell, because Plains bands were not what we would call hygienic and would simply move when their camp grounds became too polluted to bear. As a general rule, some local band leader would be enticed (bribed) by offers of horses, weapons, medals, trinkets or other European products considered valuable to enter into a specific agreement. \u201cWhite men\u201d called them treaties and expected every member of the band or even tribe to adhere to that deal. But these were individual deals in all cases, never binding on anyone except the one person who made it! One leader might commit to respect a settler\u2019s right of passage over a temporary Amerindian hunting territory. When his friends decided to raid them, steal their horses, rape their women and kidnap their children (child mortality rates were very high and children were always sought), the guy who gave his word would abstain from the raid but saw no problem with his friends taking the opportunity to pillage. That was their way of life. And they never lied. There are many books on the topic, many concentrating on the ancient practices of specific tribes before they lost a lot of their unique cultural practices by the co-mingling with other tribes on secured government reservations where they absorbed different habits. Some of the practices specific to certain tribes (like wearing feathered headdresses) in the 18th Century were adopted by other tribes when they were forced to co-mingled in the latter part of the 19th Century.

            "answer_text": "After they were in negotiations with the American government, someone pliable and confused (often unable to speak English, let alone read the complex treaty documents) was often selected at the legitimate decision-maker by the Army or Bureau of Indian Affairs (\u201cchief\u201d is more of a European and American term/concept applied mostly incorrectly to the very fluid and far less authoritarian tribal governance.) In such negotiations it was typical to pick or anoint a low-level occasional and narrow function \u201cchief\u201d in the immediately handy or compliant band as able to contract for his entire tribe, like picking a junior County Commissioner you already had under control sign a major contract obligating his entire state (an illegal agreement in contract law.) The tribes mostly operated as extreme democracies which was crippling in fighting more decisive organizations whether the Aztecs, Iroquois Confederacy, Powhatan Confederacy, Five Civilized Tribes in the Southeast, Mississippians, Adena, Hopewell, etc. let alone the Spanish, British, or Americans (the British being the most organized, the Spanish more rogue bands of criminals often forgiven by the Spanish government, and the Americans chaotic with organization only appearing in looking back rather than at the time.) Chiefs or leaders were numerous in a band, much less a whole tribe of many scattered bands with a common culture, and temporary jobs elected formally and often just prior to the need for them, i.e. to lead an attack or raid, to move the camp or permanent village site from depleted farm fields or thinned out wild game and plants, to run annual large gatherings of the tribe, to handle spiritual matters, to head one of the many societies (much like a modern service club with many present in each band), or to negotiate with other tribes, bands, or Europeans. So a small band might well have 4\u20136 current \u201cchiefs\u201d, none with the overarching authority of a European King, and 8\u201315 men who\u2019d been a chief in the past and might be again or would be key advisors. A war chief, unlike an army general or colonel, was someone who came up with a vague or detailed plan (\u201clet\u2019s go attack those guys a hundred miles away, kill a few, and steal as many of their horses as we can or burn down their village and fields so they\u2019ll starve, depending on the opportunities\u201d) that drew enough volunteers among the teenagers and 20-something men to be sufficient to attempt. Men in their 30\u2019s were too old for raids or war parties, tasked with staying at home and guarding the village, unless they were a war leader or shaman (Sitting Bull was a shaman, medicine man, and not a war chief like Gall, Crazy Horse, Red Cloud, Rains In Face, etc.). Unlike European societies at the time, women had a much more visibly powerful role in most tribes too. Property like homes, horses, goods, and possibly farm fields-most Native Americans relied on sophisticated and diverse permanent farming more than hunting and gathering- was owned and passed down through the mothers rather than the fathers and it was very simple for a woman to divorce and dispossess her husband at any time for any reason. The women had their own societies and did the majority of the real work in camps (making and erecting housing, butchering, tanning, sewing, cooking, farming, food preservation, footwear, leather goods making, firewood and fuel gathering, wild plant gathering, healing, childcare, etc. while the men mostly talked, made and practiced with weapons, chopped down trees, managed the horses and dogs, defended from raiders, traded, and made raids for theft or war. So if the women didn\u2019t go along with a plan of action, it was unable to proceed usually. It\u2019s persuasion, ability to share a vision, how well their past plans had turned out in execution, personal popularity and charisma, rank in particular tribal societies like the Kit Fox, the Dogs, the Bear, etc., oratorical skills, family members present, etc. that determined who would be chief, much like elections now rather than formal appointments by a King, warlord, emperor, President etc. and that caused endless confusion with those who thought everyone was governed the same way.
