            "answer_text": "Spain always considered the Canaries integral parts of metropolitan Spain and not colonies (even though, clearly, they were colonized about a century before the Americas). I\u2019m not sure what the distance is where that happens: \u201cthis close is integral; that distance is a colony\u201d. France caught on early and incorporated a lot of her overseas territories decades ago. That\u2019s why Martinique and Reunion are essentially incorporated an integral parts of France (as if a part of mainland France). The Canaries operate like that. They are, in fact, two provinces. But that\u2019s just politics. The biggest reason is that migration to and from the Canaries to mainland Spain was always fluid and Spain moved quickly to incorporate them into the mother nation with all the rights of peninsulars (people from the peninsula). Spain has treated the Canaries as near overseas provinces from about 1600 onwards, which is important since that\u2019s when the Guanche people had been utterly vanquished and otherwise exterminated. What few remained, were quickly overwhelmed by the settlers who intermarried with them. People in the Canaries have a somewhat abrasive term for mainlanders: \u201cgodos\u201d (roughly \u201cgoth\u201d, but with none of the macabre connotation in English), from the term, \u201cgodilandia\u201d. It\u2019s a cognate of \u201cVisigodo\u201d (Visigoths, in English), the first independent kingdom that roughly equates what is Spain (and Portugal) today. There is a very, very mild movement in the Canaries to declare independence. I once lived with a family that wanted independence for them. I thought they were idiots. But that was just me. The movement has less traction than the Texas independence movement (which is to say: it\u2019s pretty small). Their flag looks like this:  ",
