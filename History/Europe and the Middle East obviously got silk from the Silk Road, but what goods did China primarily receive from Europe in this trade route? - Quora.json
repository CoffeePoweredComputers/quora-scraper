            "answer_text": "The term \u201cSilk Road\u201d was coined by a German scholar in the 19th Century. The land route SILK ROAD stretched from China\u2019s Xi\u2019an to the Mediterranean Sea for some 4000 miles (6437 KM). It started during the Han Dynasty (206 BC\u2014220 AD). In 138 BC, the great emperor Han Wudi sent imperial envoy Zhang Qian \u5f20\u9a9e on a trade route across the border to the west. Before the use of coal to fire bricks, rammed earth was used to build the Han Great Wall to protect the trade routes from nomadic raids. Camels and horses were used to transport silk from China coveted by Romans. Silk was cool and flowing; it absorbed dye for colorful designs on the fabric. China invented various equipment of weaving and looming to produce several kinds of silk called \u7eeb\u7e99\u7ef8\u7f0e. It was the high tech of ancient times. Silk was used as currency along the Silk Road. When it reached Rome, the price of silk increased 100 times--one pound of silk cost 12 ounces of gold. Julius Caesar led the fashion in silk himself. Camels and horses carried merchandise from Chang\u2019An (today\u2019s Xi\u2019an) westward over mountain passes and deserts to form a network of routes for trade in silk and tea in exchange for horses and spices as well as gold, precious metals, jade and ivory. Zheng He of Ming Dynasty led seven naval expeditions (1405\u20131433) to open the Silk Road of the sea to reach as far as Africa preceding Columbus by some 80 years. The expeditions were for trade and cultural exchange, not for invasion of colonies. Perhaps more significant than trade, cultural interaction flourished along the routes. The Tang Dynasty (618\u2014907) was a period of cultural achievements. The capital Chang\u2019an was an international metropolis teeming with thousands of foreigners: Turks, Iranians, Japanese, Koreans, Malays\u2026as students or merchants. China exported inventions like paper, printing, gun powder, paper money, porcelain, tea\u2026.and Chinese culture of philosophy, religion, poetry, art, calligraphy\u2026. (In China, gun powder was used for fireworks, not firearms. It was called gun powder after the West used it in weapons). China contributed in cultural exchange while importing material goods. The Chinese were known for their love of jade since ancient times. Yumen Guan (Gate of Jade) was established in the Han Dynasty to collect taxes on jade imports. ",

            "answer_text": "Not a lot from Europe made it all the way to China and vice versa. When we generalize \u201cthe Silk Road\u201d as a continent-spanning thing, we\u2019re really talking about a series of trade networks which move goods by relay\u2014say, England to Italy to the Levant to Persia to Bactria to the Tarim Basin to China\u2014rather than non-stop from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts. That said, Europe contributed a number of goods to the network, some of which eventually reached China: wool, glass, coral, amber, and furs. Europe even contributed certain categories of silk. Mediterranean murex dye, apparently, took exceptionally well to silk, so purple silk textiles were a notable high-prestige export of the Byzantine empire. ",
