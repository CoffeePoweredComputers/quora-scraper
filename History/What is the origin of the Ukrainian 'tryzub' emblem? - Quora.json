            "answer_text": " The Tryzub or 3 tooth is the manure fork (pitch fork) Ukrainian nationalists favored to dispatch their enemies and their children starting with Petliura\u2019s 1st attempt at setting up the nation. Ukrainian nationalists used to torture their enemies by pitching their small children over a wall with the pitchfork. It was and is the symbol of the Radical party which got its start in Petliura\u2019s day (1918\u20131918 1/2). Contrary to the propaganda, it is not a representation of a falcon (falcons don\u2019t have teeth) or anything else other than a simple farm implement commandeered to violent actions. Nationalist Ukraine has to be the only nation in history that is proud enough of a history like this to make a manure mover their national symbol. They inherited the symbol as well as the flag from the ultranationalist Canadian Diaspora. ",

            "answer_text": "Tryzub literally means \u201ctrident,\u201d a three-toothed thing, and not necessarily a forked weapon. The symbol is probably a stylized falcon diving at its prey. The coat of arms of Ukraine descends from the official seal of the dynasty of Volodymyr of Kyiv (also known as Saint Vladimir the Great), a medieval prince of Kyivan Rus from 980 to 1015. This Scandinavian kuningaz (kniaz, in Slavic languages) consolidated the lands of the East Slavic peoples under a single throne, officially accepted Orthodox Christianity from Byzantium in 988, and drove the Kyivans into the Dnipro to baptize them. The East Slavs\u2019 name for his foreign ruling class, the Rus, came to represent their own lands and their own identities in names like Ruthenia and Russia (through Latin), Rossiya (through Greek), and Belarus.
