            "answer_text": "As several have already said, war has almost always been brutal. Maybe ancient warfare seemed especially brutal because it often involved men fighting and killing each other up close. In that case, you could argue that it was more personal, but I don't know about it being more brutal. What really interests me is your second question. For much of human history, human rights hasn't been a legal, agreed-upon concept. It was there in bits and pieces, though, like in the case of the Cyrus Cylinder, which some believe to be the world's first declaration of human rights. In ancient warfare, might made right. I'm generalizing, but ordinary soldiers didn't really have rights as we think of them today (or at least, their rights were not recognized). The lives of common soldiers weren't a general's top priority beyond the strength in numbers they gave him. I doubt Alexander the Great or Cambyses wanted to preserve the lives of their men purely because they cared about them as people. Also, political leaders rarely had their soldiers' lives in mind when going to war in the first place. Kings and emperors often had, in theory, absolute authority, with not as many checks on their power as leaders do today. Sure, an emperor may unofficially need the support of the nobles and leaders within his empire before conquering another state, but he did need a majority vote from Congress. Your question is actually more complicated than you think. Some say that the value of a life is agreed upon according to the culture and values of the time, while others say that it's objective. During ancient times, leaders usually didn't care how their warring affected common soldiers. War was to benefit the people in power anyway. To them, yes, most human lives were \"less valuable \". ",

            "answer_text": "It was brutal on a personal level because it was fought at arm\u2019s length by most combatants. You could see the face of the man you were trying to kill as he tried to kill you. You smelled his sweat intermingled with yours as you struggled, you heard him grunt and pant just as you were doing, and if you were the one to get the first clean blow in you could feel his flesh give way to the point of your spear or sword and hear him scream in agony as you ripped open his body. You smelled, and often tasted, his blood as it spilled and spurted. But you probably didn\u2019t kill him with one blow, so the fight went on until one of you died or yielded. Or maybe yielded and died. War is just a brutal on a personal level for the ones on the receiving end of modern weapons. But the distance has grown so that most combatants never get close enough to clearly see the face of the person they\u2019re battling. Small arms at a 100, 300, 1,000 meters. And the most horrific damage is done to human bodies by weapons whose triggers are pulled miles away from their target. A tank 5 miles away, a bomber at 30,000 feet, a ship over the horizon, a drone pilot 10 time zones away. The brutality doesn\u2019t change but now we deal it out in wholesale quantities with impersonal weapons that rob the dead of their connection to humanity. They\u2019re casualties, collateral damage, unintended consequences. They\u2019re just numbers. The few who do still engage in close combat where the face of the enemy is recognizable: snipers, Special Forces, small infantry units receive special recognition from the rest of society. We somehow grasp that their experience of war is different, that they still see the brutality up close, they take the human measure of the cost of war. ",
