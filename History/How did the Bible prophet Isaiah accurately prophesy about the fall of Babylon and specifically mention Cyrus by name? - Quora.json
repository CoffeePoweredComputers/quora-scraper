            "answer_text": "The guild of critical scholars would say he didn't because it wasn't Isaiah and it wasn't future prophecy as that part was written in exile or post-exile.  The beliefs of that same guild are basically that while there may have been earlier sources, the Hebrew bible as we know it is a work of redaction from the post-exile period.  They tend to view it as a political work constructing a history for a people and to rally support for the 2nd temple. I think commentator John Oswalt in the New International Commentary on the OT (NICOT) series captures the truth.  \"Those who take biblical theology seriously cannot avoid the nature of Isaiah's arguments.  One must face those arguments, and deny or accept their truthfulness.  Isaiah claims that the evidence for the uniqueness of God, that he is the sole creator, rests on his ability to predict novel turns in history in advance, an ability the idols and their technicians do not have...The shape of the present book and the absence of any authorial identification except that of Isaiah ben Amoz lead me to believe that these predictions had been made far in advance of the events, and that their eventual confirmation would be the crowning evidence that Israel's God is God alone.  One cannot escape this logic...(p192 of Isaiah 40-66)\".   The prophecy of Cyrus is central to the entire argument of Isaiah.  The only reason to reject it is the presupposition that there is no such thing as future prophecy.  I'm with Oswalt the choice is God exists and can do this, or a rejection of God altogether.  The critical guild held a large sway for a long time.  They could bestow or yank away \"credibility\".  Fortunately, that era has largely come to an end.  Yes, there are still lots of critical scholars who talk to each other in \"prestigious\" journals, but everybody knows what they are about.   And their days are numbered as those are the departments most likely targeted for reduction.  Within the church there are plenty of serious credible scholars who are doing actually interesting research beyond bad politics.  Beyond Oswalt, Reed Lessing has a great commentary on this section of Isaiah with the emphasis on creational theology.  The bibliographies of both are extensive and a rich source of support and argument. ",

            "answer_text": "The prophecy of Cyrus is central to the entire argument of Isaiah. The reason for this is the presupposition that the prophecies of Jesus supposedly found in this book are undermined once we accept the consensus of biblical scholars who say the book had multiple authors writing over a period of centuries. If Isaiah, son of Amoz, did not really prophesy the Babylonian Exile and its aftermath, what (if anything) did he prophesy? Cyrus and the fall of Babylon are described by the second of three authors, writing towards the end of the Exile. The accepted sequence of authors is: Chapters 1 to 39 were written during the late eighth and early seventh centuries BCE by Isaiah, son of Amoz, apart from numerous additions from a later period. For ease of reference, Isaiah is often referred to as First Isaiah, or proto-Isaiah. His interest was Assyria as the dominant power at the time, and his belief that Judah\u2019s rulers were wrong in allying themselves with Assyria.An important passage in chapter 14 is placed out of order, within material concerning Assyria, but deals with the late Babylonian Exile. This is of particular interest because it describes Deutero-Isaiah\u2019s glee at the defeat of the king of Babylon, who had in life hoped that the gods would place him in heaven among the stars.Chapters 40 to 55 were written by a prophet living in exile during the latter part of the Babylonian Exile. This author, referred to as Second Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah, had a more extensive vocabulary and more lyrical style of writing than First Isaiah. We notice Second Isaiah referring to the Jews as Israelites, whereas to First Isaiah, the Israelites were an enemy, if only reluctantly. Jews considered Samaria to be illegitimate, believing that sooner or later they would inherit the land of the former northern kingdom on behalf of their lost cousins, and demonstrated this by calling themselves Israelites.The third source, now known as Third Isaiah, or Trito-Isaiah, wrote chapters 56 to 66 during the period following the Return from Exile. H. G. M. Williamson, in his Essay: \u2018The concept of Israel in transition\u2019, considers the possibility that chapters 55-66 could even be the work of several authors, writing over a period of several centuries, after the Return.Isaiah 45:1, 4\u20135 shows Deutero-Isaiah\u2019s joy at Cyrus\u2019 conquest of the hated Babylonians, attributing Cyrus\u2019 success to God, although Cyrus was a pagan: Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut \u2026 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me. I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: ",

Proto-Isaiah is the original Isaiah Ben Amoz, an author writing before the Babylonian Exile.Deutero-Isaiah is written by another, post exile author.Trito-Isaiah is a collection of passages that may have been an edited collection, created after Deutero-Isaiah. The chapters referencing Cyrus are unambiguously a part of Deutro-Isaiah. They are pseudepigrapha, referencing the past by pretending to be the voice of a past prophet. Their source of information is not prophetic, it is history. ",
