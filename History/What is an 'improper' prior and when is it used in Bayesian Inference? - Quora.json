            "answer_text": "An improper prior just means that the prior need not be a proper distribution, i.e., it doesn't integrate to one (it doesn't even need to be finite).   It turns out that the for many computations, substituting an improper prior for a proper one still works out.  For example, consider a naive Bayes classifier: p(Y | X) \\propto p(X | Y) * p(Y) It is evident that p(Y) just serves as a weighting function and you are free to replace it with arbitrary weights: p(Y | x) \\propto p(X | Y) * w(Y) and your result still makes sense.
