            "answer_text": "Positive: He was an extremely successful military general, having a perfect battle record. He destroyed the Achaemenid Empire - the largest Empire till that point - by the age of 25.He was incredibly charismatic. Alexander, from what we know, wasn\u2019t much to look at: he was short, a little dark, and had heterochromia. But he made up with it for his charisma, with which he was able to have his army follow him from Greece to India. He earned the love of his soldiers through hard work \u2014 he shared their rations, ate their food, and spent most of his time with them.He was a brilliant and innovative military officer, with unsurpassed military skill up to that time. When Tyre\u2019s walls refused to let his troops in, Alexander constructed a causeway and took the city by storm. At Gaugamela, he brilliantly defeated a much larger Persian army and inflicted a mortal blow to the Achaemenid Persian Empire. It is no wonder that he was able to amass a massive Empire by the age of 32.He ushered in the Hellenistic Age, where Greek states would replace Persia as the predominant world powers. Hellenistic culture would stretch from the Western Mediterranean to the Far East, and influence countless inventions. This would not have been possible without Alexander the Great, whose conquests laid the foundation for both the Parthian Empire and the Byzantine Empire. The Macedonian Empire and it\u2019s successor states would have a permanent impact on the Middle East.Negative: He was bloodthirsty and ruthless. He conquered for the sake of conquest, and was willing to murder thousands just to spread his name. Despite the mythos he established about himself, he was no \u201cgreat bastion of Greek culture\u201d \u2014 he was willing to wipe out Thebes and kill his own fellow Greeks. He killed his father\u2019s greatest general, Parmenion, for the sole reason that he felt slighted by the elderly general.He was an alcoholic. Whatever time Alexander didn\u2019t spend fighting, he spent partying and getting drunk. And when he was drunk, he lost all control over himself \u2014 as all alcoholics do. He killed his general, Cleitus, after a drunken fight and torched the city of Persepolis in a drunken bout \u2014 killing hundreds of Zoroastrian priests, civilians, and destroying centuries\u2019 worth of knowledge. Towards the end of his life, Alexander alternated between extreme sadness and paranoia, a sign of alcoholism. And as Alexander began relying on the bottle, it was the bottle that killed him.He was emotionally unstable. Alexander and his father never had the best relationship; Philip was an alcoholic just like his son, extremely sarcastic, and cared little about his family and his own son. Alexander became extremely insecure as a result of this, and it was this that motivated him to conquer the world \u2014 to hide his own insecurities of himself, he set out campaigning across Asia to prove himself an equal to his idols Heracles and Achilles, whom Alexander both admired and deeply envied. To further hide his own insecurities, Alexander declared himself a God-King, the son of Zeus-Ammon, and built dozens of monuments across his Empire \u2014 to symbolize that he was equal to his idols. He murdered those who even slightly insulted him and, in order to convince himself against his own insecurities, began telling himself that he was a God.He benefited heavily from his father\u2019s conquests. Through over twenty years of careful political manipulation, conquest, and maneuvering, Philip of Macedon finally unified Greece under Macedonian hegemony. Although the Greek states rebelled after his death, Philip had already dealt an irreparable blow to the old order and had essentially solidified Macedonian dominance. Now was Alexander necessarily Great? Yes, in that he was one of the few historical people who upset the old political order and changed the world completely. His brilliance cannot be overstated: Alexander was idolized by virtually every military leader after him, including Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Antiochus III, Julius Caesar, Trajan, Mehmet the Conqueror, Napoleon, and many more. Alexander\u2019s personal life was\u2026complicated, to say the least. He was alternatively insecure and egomaniacal, and incredibly bloodthirsty and cruel towards his enemies. His campaigns were incredibly brutal. But the title of \u201cthe Great\u201d is generally given to those who, for better of worse, have changed history almost solely through their own innovation. Alexander was one of the finest strategists of his time and a genius. Is that a hallmark of greatness? I would say so. ",
