When there are 7s, 8s and 9s everywhere, it gets boring, but boring in a good way. Attraction isn\u2019t strictly visual, but is also about voice, movement/gait, taste, touch and smell. Attraction varies so your candidates for most attractive Norwegians might be fairly different to a list another might make. ",
