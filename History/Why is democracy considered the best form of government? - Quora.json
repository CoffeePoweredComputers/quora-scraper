            "answer_text": "Democracy is form of government in which the following aspects are ideally contained: Basic and universal rights for each of the individuals in their dealings with other individuals and the government.A centralized lawmaking and judiciary process that is ultimately determined by the choices made by the citizens it rules over: government for, by and from the people.A social structure that allows society to care for its weakest and poorest, shielding them form at least some of the harm they would have suffered otherwise.A government responsible to its citizens due to the danger of losing favor through re-election.Separation of powers; an independent system that functions either on a bipartite or the classical tripartite system, once again guaranteeing that the central government does not gain too much power over the citizens it rules over.A government able to form authority services and that provides police officers, firemen, paramedics and soldiers to shield the collective from harm and imminent danger.Democracy combines the aspects of a benevolent government with the outlines of preventing malevolent government. Democracy, unlike anarchical approaches to society, provides its citizens with stable public services and with a strong and independent judiciary that cannot as easily be bribed. It also protects its citizens through a strong outward defense and inward law enforcement. On the other hand however, the rights of citizens being guaranteed and the powers of government being separated prevents the central authorities from becoming the malevolent force that you would see in fascism or communism. Hence, the democratic state is superior to far-right and far-left approaches to government as well as to approaches of dissolving the state entirely. ",

            "answer_text": "Because people are stupid and short-sighted and brain-washed. Winston Churchill is credited with saying something along these lines: Democracy is the WORST form of government ever invented, except for all others that have been tried. (As I recall, I think he was quoting or paraphrasing some one before him.) I think this statement is much more accurate than calling democracy the \u201cbest\u201d form of government. Do you realize the incredible hubris and close-mindedness to think that humanity has reached the pinnacle of possible governmental systems at this juncture of history? In a universe that is billions of years old, and is likely to exist for billions of years more, and given that humanity could potentially continue to live and learn and evolve for millions of years into the future (if we are lucky enough not to go extinct), do you think it is reasonable to insist that humans will never, ever, ever come up with a better form of government than the one we have right now? Yeah, right. That makes as much sense as insisting we will never build a faster car or smaller computer chip than what we have today. It\u2019s falsity is pretty much self-evident. Unfortunately, there is very limited opportunity to try out new forms of government and, frankly, there are a lot of impediments against even trying to conceive of alternative forms of government. I mean, from 1940 to 1990, if you suggested that democracy was not the absolute best thing possible, you\u2019d be branded a commie and ostracized. Consider that our democracy implemented in the 1700s was basically the first attempt to implement a representative government whereby the people, not a small group or just one person, held the power of government. To the extent that humanity was in a \u201cbad relationship\u201d with oppressive forms of government throughout all recorded history to that point, and democracy was the first alternative we came up with, maybe it is foolish to assume we landed on the best option on our very first try? Seriously, democracy is like our \u201crebound\u201d form of government after getting out of a bad long-term relationship with monarchies. To insist we have found the love of our life is pretty short-sighted. Note, democracy is not the only form of egalitarian, representative government possible. However, governments are jealous of their power. Monarchs protected other monarchs because they knew once people took power from one monarchy, others were more likely to lose their power. Democracies feel the same way, so for self-preservation, they indoctrinate their people with this notion that they are the best, that there could not be anything better, so don\u2019t worry your pretty, little head about it. Sure, democracies lead to career politicians, backroom deals between lobbyists and legislators, and laws that overwhelmingly favor the rich and special interests, but don\u2019t let any of those huge negatives get in the way of your slavish devotion to this particular political system, after all it beats dictatorship, right? Seriously, if the best thing you can say about democracy is that it is not dictatorship, that\u2019s pretty damn sad. Way to set the bar as low as possible. As just one example of another form of representative government other than democracy, consider how the jury system works for a murder trial in America. When we as a nation need to decide a matter of life and death, do we ask an elected politician to make the decision? No, we randomly select people from the community, which process is statistically likely to generate a representative cross-section of the community. Even though these people are not lawyers or judges and may have limited schooling, we charge them to decide life and death issues, and they do. And you know what? While the jury system is not perfect, it is almost entirely free from corruption. The jury\u2019s decision can be stupid, but it is almost always honest and sincere. It is theoretically possible to extend this form of decision-making from court cases to all aspects of government. I am not suggesting a jury be impaneled to answer every question that arises in government, but we could pick our executive and legislative branches through random selection rather than a voting process. The funny thing is, statistically this will create a government that is an almost perfect representation of the demographics within the society. If 10% of Americans are gay, then 10% of the randomly selected legislators are likely to be gay. If 25% of Americans are black, then 25% of the legislators are likely to be black. If 50% of Americans are female, then 50% of the legislators are likely to be female. If 1% of Americans are black Lesbian atheists, then 1% of the politicians would be, too. No longer would our politicians be overwhelmingly male, wealthy, white, Protestants who went to Ivy League schools. While no one would personally select a particular candidate, the end result is a governmental body that is vastly superior at reflecting the actual values and views of the nation. There would be no elections, so no campaigns, no politicians selling out for campaign donations, and the corrupting influence of money on elections is eliminated over night. Yes, there are some challenges, but overall the system seems much less susceptible to corruption. Anyway, I have coined such a governmental system \u201crandomocracy,\u201d and I personally think it would be better than voter-based democracy. Ultimately, though, the point is not to sell you on randomocracy, the point is to clarify that democracy as we know it today, \u201cone person / one vote,\u201d as not the only possible form of government that would be representative and effect the will of the people. I have given one example, I am sure there are many others. To suggest that we hit the jackpot on our first try is ludicrous. Anyone suggesting that democracy is the best form of government is demonstrating their own bias, near-sightedness and close-mindedness. ",
