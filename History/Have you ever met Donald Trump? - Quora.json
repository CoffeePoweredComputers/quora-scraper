            "answer_text": "I met President Trump onceMemory is an elusive thingCirca 2003\u20132005In Midtown ManhattanMy brain categorized it with 3 other politicians /political figures, I met around the same timeSenator Bob & Elizabeth Dole, Mayor Rudy Giluliani, and Archbishop Desmond TutuI shook hands with all of the people in #3. I remember telling Elizabeth Dole, it's an honor to meet an American hero- her husband. She was very gracious and they were very good looking\u2026Mayor Giluluani gave me a firm handshake but his eyes were vacant. Almost looking through me\u2026 no usual politician gladhandiing, faux charmArchbishop Tutu I remember very little except, everything out of his mouth was how George W. Bush was Lucifer or something like thatSo\u2026 what the fuck does this have to do w me meeting President Trump, you ask my 2 readers? haha\u2026. Well- channeling President Reagan haha\u2014- one of those times in #6, I met President Trump.It was in midtown manhattan, between 42nd & 59th street. Unsure east or west sideLasted less than 1 minute\u2026 maybe 45 seconds\u2026He didn't shake my hand. But did acknowledge and nod. And said a few generic small talk phrases. Had a smile on his face\u2026And seems like- the vibe I got- was that he was a cool guy\u2026 but anyhoo that's all I remember.Can't tell you more 'cause I told you already\u2026 w apologies to Billy Joel haha",

            "answer_text": "Passed him in the hall at 725 Fifth Avenue on my way to help the Apprentice production crew (at the top of that UGLY escalator that he came down to announce his candidacy). I very obviously ignored him because I know a lot of folks in the construction industry in NYC and have absolutely nothing to say to the \u201cman\u201d. I watched his reflection as I passed him and he was obviously frowning at the fact that someone can walk right by the guy whose name is on the side of the building and not be star struck. Sorry, DJ Trump. I worked at MTV and met LOTS of celebrities. I don\u2019t do star struck\u2026 and the only way you\u2019re a star is by the dictionary definition - a big, exploding, flaming ball of gas. ",
