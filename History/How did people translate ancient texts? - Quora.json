            "answer_text": "Even if the native speakers have died out, there will be intermediate forms to work from. An ancient language does not exist in total isolation (except possibly Basque!). So Champollion was able to translate ancient hieroglyphics despite the fact that nobody spoke ancient Egyptian, because he had the Rosetta Stone -- a trilingual document in two forms of Egyptian and ancient Greek. He also was aware that Coptic, the liturgical language of the Egyptian Christian Church, was descended from ancient Egyptian. So there were clues in other languages that he could work form. There do remain a few languages that we've never translated because we haven't found enough connections to any that we know. Linear A is one. ",

(See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B). Some scripts remain uncracked.  Linear A read with the sound values of Linear B comes out as gibberish.  Possibly an unknown language, but also these might have been ideograms.  The symbols used by the Indus Valley Civilization remain an enigma and it's not certain it was ever a full writing system. ",

Or asked any of the Greeks they'd enslaved during the Islamic conquest. There were initially, at least, Jewish, Coptic, Orthodox, Roman Catholic .... scholars in places such as Baghdad, who could also offer translations. ",

Many of the Arab translations weren't even straight translation from Greek to Arabic: they translated the Syriac version instead. This is another reason why Europe learned quickly to prefer Moerbeke's translations. Syriac is closely related to Arabic and Hebrew, and was still widely spoken. It is still spoken today, but not widely anymore. ",
