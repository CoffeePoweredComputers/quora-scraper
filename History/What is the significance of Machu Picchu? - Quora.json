            "answer_text": "Machu Picchu was for the Virgins of the Sun:Bingham suggested that Machu Picchu might have been a temple devoted to the Virgins of the Sun. These women dedicated their lives to the Inca Sun god. This theory was largely based on dozens of skeletons Bingham's team found buried at the site. US osteologist George Eaton said in the early twentieth century that the remains were nearly all females. This theory was overthrown in 2000, when Verano, then at Yale, examined the remains and found that the skeletons were about half males and half females. Verano's analysis was based on skeletal differences between the genders that were not known during Eaton's time. Verano believes Eaton may have been misled by the relatively diminutive size of the Andean people, who are typically shorter and less robust than the European and African skeletons with which Eaton would have been more familiar.\"He probably saw the small bones and assumed they must be female,\" he said. Archaeologists now generally agree that the skeletons at Machu Picchu were not those of Inca priestesses, but rather helpers who were brought in from all over the Inca Empire to serve at the site.\"If you thought of Machu Picchu as a royal hotel or a time-share condo for the Inca emperor and his guests, then these were the staff who cooked the food, grew the crops, and cleaned the place,\" Verano said. Machu Picchu was the last Incan city:Bingham theorized that site was both the last city of the Inca, and also the legendary \"lost city\" of Vilcabamba la Vieja, which the last of the independent Inca rulers waged a lengthy battle against Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century. He was wrong on this account, as archaeologists later discovered the actual last city was Esp\u00edritu Pampa, a jungle site about 80 miles west of the Inca capital city of Cusco. Bingham did visit Esp\u00edritu Pampa in 1911. However, he decided the site was not grand enough to be the legendary city.Excavations in the 1960s by Gene Savoy and latter extensive mapping by Vincent Lee, an architect and Andean explorer, exposed the site to be far bigger than Bingham thought. \" ... there were 400 to 500 buildings at the site ... but Bingham had only seen about 20,\" Lee said, which is more representative for the indigenous name of the site being Vilcabamba Grande. Machu Picchu was a royal retreat:Most historians agree with Verano's interpretation of the Machu Picchu skeletons as a group of individuals who worked on a royal retreat under the fifteenth-century Inca Emperor Pachacuti. According to this theory, Machu Picchu was a place for Pachacuti and his royal court, or panaca, to relax, hunt, and entertain guests.The royal estate theory was first proposed in the 1980s, and is largely based on a sixteenth-century Spanish document that referred to a royal estate called Picchu, which was built in the same general area as Machu Picchu.Machu Picchu was built to honor a sacred landscape:Another theory suggested by archaeologist and anthropologist Johan Reinhard, Machu Picchu occupied a special place in the \"sacred landscape\" of the Inca. For example, Machu Picchu is built atop a mountain that is almost completely encircled by the Urubamba River, which the Inca named the Vilcamayo, or Sacred River. Reinhard also pointed out that the rising and setting of the sun when seen from certain locations within Machu Picchu aligns neatly with religiously significant mountains during solstices and equinoxes.

            "answer_text": "Machu Picchu\u2019s Royal Plaza once became a helicopter landing pad.According to accounts by Dr. Manuel Ch\u00e1vez Ball\u00f3n, Machu Picchu\u2019s late resident archaeologist, in 1978 in preparation for the arrival of the king and queen of Spain, Carlos and Sofia, and by order of the Peruvian Government the Monolith Stone located in the middle of the Main Plaza was removed to allow for the landing of a helicopter. Later in 1989, during the presidency of Alan Garcia, the rock was removed once again to make way for helicopters during a meeting of Latin American leaders. During the removal process workers accidently broke the stone causing irreparable damage. The decision was taken to bury the rock. Shocking right! Two Peruvian sister\u2019s claim that Machu Picchu is theirs!Roxana and Victoria Abril claim that they are the rightful owners of the ancient Inca site of Machu Picchu, and are dismayed that they have to pay an entrance fee to enter their own land. They claim that their great-grandfather Mariana Ignacio Ferro legally purchased the land before it was re-discovered by Hiram Bingham in 1911. They are currently pursuing the Peruvian government for US$ 100 million in compensation as well as future profits generated from tourism.  Hiram Bingham wasn\u2019t the first to find Machu Picchu.Although it is much publicized that Hiram Bingham re-discovered Machu Picchu in 1911, there is strong evidence that in-fact several foreign explorers has arrived there many years before. In 1874 the German explorer Herman G\u00f6hring registered the citadel on his expedition map. Later, in 1901 Agustin Lizarraga left his name engraved on a wall of the three Windowed Temple, which was recorded as part of Hiram Bingham\u2019s findings, but later omitted from his memoirs. Some say that Machu Picchu was never lost, but merely kept quiet by locals. Temple of the Sun is one of its most visited and significant sites Among the structures that enhance the spiritual significance of the site is the \u201cTemple of the Sun\u201d or Torreon. It is located near the supposed residence of the Inca emperor. During the summer solstice there is an alignment between one of the temple\u2019s windows, rock and the solstice sun. Beneath the temple there is a cave which Bingham referred to as \u201croyal mausoleum\u201d. The Inca Trail is the most popular way to reach Machu Picchu The Incas built a road to Machu Picchu region, known today as the Inca Trail. This road is the most popular way to approach the site and tens of thousands of visitors use it every year to reach Machu Picchu. It is a three day journey and compulsory porters are needed in the trekking expedition. At night the porters sleep on the trail with a piece of mirror or metal under them. They do so to prevent being carried away by spirits emerging from the earth. Most of them also recount experiences of being pulled out of their tents by spirits.  Machu Picchu is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World In 1983, UNESCO declared this magnificent city as a World Heritage Site. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted as one of theNew Seven Wonders of the World. It has featured in a few movies including the 1954 film Secret of the Incas and the 2004 film, The Motorcycles Diaries. A song of 2010 South Indian film Ethiran was filmed at Machu Picchu after direct intervention from the Indian government. The site is one of the most visited tourist attractions in all of Latin America with an average of 1800 visits per day. However this has led to the site being threatened by economic and commercial forces and UNESCO is considering putting it on its List of World Heritage in Danger. What Modern Problems Does Machu Picchu Face? Despite its incredible construction and earthquake-proof foundations, modern tourism poses the biggest threat to the complex. To best preserve the area, the Peruvian government permits only 2,500 visitors per day to Machu Picchu. A no-fly zone situated above and around the perimeter, and a cap on the number of daily visitors are measures to preserve the longevity of this awe inspiring Incan experience that still holds onto its ancient charm and mysticism.
