            "answer_text": "If it is only between Azerbaijan and armenia, it should not affect the world anyhow. As I have mentioned in my previous answers, the world was silence when almost 30 years ago millions of Azeris were killed, raped, taken hostage, tortured, their lands were invaded and homes were destroyed while they were thinking they are going to live another peaceful day. I do not think it affects the world in the larger scale. Nevertheless, it does affect Caucasus and neighbouring countries. No changes are expected in the world due to our war, but I believe some changes are expected in the Caucasus. ",
