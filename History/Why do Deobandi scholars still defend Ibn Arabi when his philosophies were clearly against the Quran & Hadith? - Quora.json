            "answer_text": "There is a lot to unpack here, so let me first provide context for readers who are not familiar with some of the factions that constitute scholarly Sunni Muslim thought. This way both the question as well as the link attached to the question have broader meaning for readers. Ibn Arabi was an Andalusian Sufi mystic, who followed the Maliki school with many caveats. The question also mentions \u2018deoband\u2019. Deobands and Barelwis started off as competing reactionary Muslim religious movements to the British occupation of India, they both still exist today. They nominally follow \u2018hanafi\u2019 thought, and often vie for the same space amongst Indian Subcontinent Muslims as well as the Indian Muslim diaspora. While they compete with one another they are both generally ok with Ibn Arabi (more on that later). This is not to say they always have the same views on all jurisprudence matters such as say their Turkish Hanafi counterparts. As for the Saudi author of the website that is linked in the original post, he follows an offshoot sub-branch (or rather a fork) of the Hanbali school, linked to the Wahhabi movement of Najd, but follows a different interpretation from non-Wahhabi Hanbalis, by rejecting all of Ibn Arabi. The only ones who are missing in all of this are the followers of the Shafii school of thought, and not wanting to leave readers hanging, followers of the Shafii school in the Levant and Nusantara region (Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei) they too are ok with Ibn Arabi. With all that out of the way, the issue is not as simplistic of a reading as a fundamentalist Wahabi strain (who by the way reject all sufi mystics and not just Ibn Arabi) vs traditional schools of thought (Hanafi, Shafii, Maliki, Hanbali), though it may appear as such at first, for the biggest criticisms against Ibn Arabi were by fellow Sufis, from India such as the Hanafi Naqshbandi Shaykh Ahmed Al Sirhindi, known as the renewer of the millennium amongst Indian Sunnis. The original criticisms leveled against Ibn Arabi pertain to his doctrine on the \u2018unity of being\u2019, and most Hanafis have reconciled to it by way of adjustments to his original postulation. [For my previous answer on the \u2018unity of being\u2019 follow this link: Amori Patel's answer to Can you explain Ibn Arabi\u2019s doctrine of \u201cUnity of Being\u201d?] Ibn Arabi\u2019s strongest traditional opponents to his doctrine were the Hanafi Naqshbandi Sufis. A case of Western (Andalusian) Sufism vs Eastern (Central Asian/Persian/Indian) Sufi philosophical trends. The average Muslim layperson in the 21st century is no longer familiar with philosophical trends from several centuries ago (let alone a millennium), nor with the highly technical cosmological constructs of Ibn Arabi. Today, most Naqshbandis accept Ibn Arabi but with the caveat that his books are advanced for the layperson and to be taught by a proper Shaykh, out of fear that Ibn Arabi\u2019s words can be misconstrued in the wrong hands for they were never intended for the masses.

            "answer_text": "Ok I am assuming you are a gullible like hell and hence I will begin with stop using that site! Islamqa is basically an extremist and I mean it an extremely biased and extremist website and I believe it is funded by radicals it is better if you switch to other websites. As far as his belief was concerned that is between him and Allah and you should be worried about your faith if you think his teachings was against Quran and Sunnah than don\u2019t follow it but to arrive at conclusion of him being a Muslim or Non Muslims you yourself must know about Quran and Sunnah well which takes over decade and also you must know what exactly he meant it is easy to take words out of context mistranslate and misinterpret unless you don\u2019t know these stuffs well refrain from making assumptions. Finally if you really want to know than ask Sufis what are their philosophy and what they think about Ibn Arabi ask Sufis about questions related to sufism instead of Sunnis. ",
