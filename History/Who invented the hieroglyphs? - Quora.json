            "answer_text": "I can certainly read for you the Hieroglyphics written in the cartouche and shown to depict PTOLEMAIOS or Ptolemy. Cartouches were use to highlight important information that were to be used over a long time and across any conquered lands. Written in cartouches were title of rulers (not real names!), phrases the colonies had to insert in their allegiance vow etc. Coming to this particular cartouche. The information in the cartouche is read starting from the side with a bar. And many of Hieroglyphics are read from right to left. It reads \u2018EES AYA NG\u2019WES RESH LID TAA PAA\u2019. Literally meaning DOES GOOD THE GIANT LAYING AMBUSH UNITE TAAPA You can see some difficulty in getting the intended meaning. This is most difficult part of translating Hieroglyphics. A phrase could have up five probable meanings. You can get more of this from the book ANCIENT EGYPT BELONGED TO MAASAI by Mathew ole-Lona ",

            "answer_text": "No one knows for certain. The oldest evidence of Hieroglyphic Writing comes from the are now know as Sudan. Also archaeological evidence of Astronomy, etc. are dated back to 10, 000+ BCE, Nabta playa. However, it is not clear if the Hieroglyphic system was invented, or simply recognized, meaning A Writing System put together based on Specific observations of Nature. Flight was not invented by humans, but different ways to fly were. Writing? Animals make body gestures that have Specific meanings. Those body gestures when written as a picture tell stories\u2026 So we're body and other Nature gestures the teacher of writing? No one knows for sure. I definitely have ideas on the issue, related to Natural forms and formally guided meditation. We do know that Hieroglyphics were in use around 5000 BCE, for sure. Wrongly, people place Hieroglyphics at 3500 BCE or less. But, that is around the START of Dynastic Egypt. Africa had writing long before then and specifically the \u201cNubian-Egyptians\u201d had Hieroglyphics, long before Dynasties began degrading the culture and Native ways. ",
