Most of the people living there now descend from foreigners who had invaded \"egypt\" in the 7th Century A.D. Kemet (\u201cegypt\u201d) was invaded by the Hyksos, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Copts, Arabs, then ultimately the French and English. Africans are the earliest human population on our planet! Factually, they were the firat humans in Europe (Grimaldi Man) the first humans in Asia (Betek People and Jawarna People) Arabia ( the Nubians) Australia (Aboriginal) etc. Question, since Africans are the oldest human population or the longest lived, then how would it follow that Arabs, European -whites ect, could be indigenous to Africa when Africans are indigenous to Europe, Asia and Arabia?! The concepts of \"White Africans\" or white- Arab \"Africans\" is not consistent with human evolution or human anthropology. In fact, there are 3000 indigenous African tribes. Notwithstanding, many of the peoples there ( in Africa) now are not anthropologically the original inhabitants especially in North and South Africa. Whites were \u201cspirited off\u201d Swedish, French, Spanish, Portuguese, British and American ships and were then brought to Northern Africa's Barbary Coast States such as Morrocco, Libya, Tunis, Algeria and Egypt as SLAVES by African Muslim tribesmen, Arab Muslims and European Christians. The ancient Africans or at least the ones in Kemet show a strong DNA evidence related to East Africans especially with Nubian ( Waset) and Ethiopian (Abysinia) peoples with some Southern African DNA For some strange reason European Jewish descendants DNA being haplogroup \"J\" is used as a standard however, when they are not the standard! African Jewry far preceed European Jews and Europeans in general are not in the African time line to begin with! The notion of \" white- Africans \" aside from being an hilarious concept is a 19th Century political construct! There was never a time when Caucasoids, Caucasian, Europeans or whites were indigenous to the continent of Africa.

            "answer_text": "E. Groeg's answer to How are modern Egyptians related to ancient Egyptians? # 1: Ancient Egyptians were not black. History disagrees with this and so does biology and geography. # 2: You cannot look like a subsaharan African and be a native of Cairo. # 3 : Egypt is a region near the Mediterranean, meaning the people there would\u2019ve naturally looked Arab or North African with Mediterranean and SSA hints. # 4: Now sure, Egypt may have had black pharaohs, palace guards, citizens and such. But they were probably NOT native to the region. They were merely immigrants from the south. Egypt today still has subsaharan looking people to the south.  # 1 : Only Euro-centric historians agree with \u201cancient Egyptians were not black\u201d. Geography and biology totally disagree with \u201cancient Egyptians were not black. Shahid Alam, a Pakistani scholar, wrote the following : Eurocentrism emerged as an ideological project \u2013 shaped by Europe\u2019s intellectual elites \u2013 in the service of Europe\u2019s rising expansionist, starting in the sixteenth century. It makes sweeping claims of European superiority in all spheres of civilization. \u201cAncient Egyptians were black\u201d will forever shatter European sense of superiority. Ancient Egypt was founded and ruled by people of the Nile for thousands of years before it was invaded, conquered and occupied by people from Eurasia (Hyksos, Romans, Greeks, Persians etc.). Among people of the Nile are the Nilotes, some of the blackest Africans. Other people of the Nile are the elongated Africans aka Horners and Nilo-Saharan speakers like the Tebu and the Fulani. There were no Eurasians in Africa, including Egypt, until 3 000 years ago. Error found in study of first ancient African genome Finding that much of Africa has Eurasian ancestry was mistaken. This week the authors issued a note explaining the mistake in their October 2015 Science paper on the genome of a 4,500-year-old man from Ethiopia \u2014 the first complete ancient human genome from Africa. The man was named after Mota Cave, where his remains were found. Although the first humans left Africa some 100,000 years ago, a study published in 2013 found that some came back again around 3,000 years ago; this reverse migration has left its trace in African genomes. There is nothing comparable with ancient Egypt anywhere in Eurasia. Eurocentrists know that too well ; that is why they established a discipline \u201cEgyptology\u201d Egyptology - Wikipedia Egyptology (from Egypt and Greek -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logia. Arabic: \u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a\u200e) is the study of ancient Egyptian history, language, literature, religion, architecture and art from the 5th millennium BC until the end of its native religious practices in the 4th century AD. # 2 : There is no such as thing as sub-Saharan look. Sub-Saharans, we do not all look the same. The Hima of Uganda and the Tutsi of Rwanda have aquiline features; they are Africans south of the Sahara. The San of Southern Africa have yellowish skin and slanted eyes. They are Africans south of the Sahara. How did the natives of present day Cairo look thousands of years ago ? Egypt has seen several waves of invasions from Eurasia. When a land gets invaded, its demographics change. The written word of the time is crystal clear about how ancient Egyptians looked. Aristotle (384-322 B.C.E.) Greek philosopher, scientist, and tutor to Alexander the Great wrote the following :   \"Too black a hue marks the coward as witness Egyptians and Ethiopians and so does also too white a complexion as you may see from women, the complexion of courage is between the two.\" (Physiognomics, Vol. VI, 812a) Diodorus Siculus, a Greek historian, wrote the following : They say also that the Egyptians are colonists sent out by the Ethiopians, Osiris having been the leader of the colony. # 3 : Egypt is not a region near the Mediterranean. It is a Mediterranean country. Northern coast of Egypt - Wikipedia  The Mediterranean Coast of Egypt  Hotels of Porto Marina The northern coast of Egypt (Egyptian Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0649\u200e El S\u0101\u1e25el El \u0160am\u0101li, north coast, commonly shortened to \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0644El S\u0101\u1e25el, \"the coast\") extends for about 1,050 km (650 mi) along the Mediterranean Sea from the eastern side of the Sinai Peninsula at the Egypt-Gaza border to the western village of Sallum at Egypt's border with Libya. It is one of the longest Mediterranean coastlines in North Africa.  There is not just one Arab look or North African look. Someone said that there are not particular Arab facial features. The Arab World is very diverse from the blackest Sudanese to the palest Syrians. North Africa is also a very diverse place where you can find pale skinned, blond haired and blue eyed people in Morocco from the Riff Region and the darkest people with frizzy hair in the Draa Valley of Morocco. # 4 : Africa (from north to south, east to west) is the ancestral and aboriginal land of Blacks. Egyptian Pharaohs who were not black were not NATIVE to Africa or had extensive Eurasian admixture. It is a dogmatic belief that Blacks are only natives to Africa south of the Sahara and that Blacks in North Africa are immigrants from the south. It is not the truth at all. It is Euro-centric propaganda. Paul Gaffarel (1843\u20131920), a French historian and one of the brightest minds of his generation wrote this passage in his book \u201cla Conqu\u00eate de l\u2019Afrique (courtesy of Google translate) : As far back as historical memories go, Africa presents itself to us as populated, over all its immense extent, by black tribes. The oldest geographical documents depict these black tribes as fixed, from time immemorial, in the countries where they still build their huts and graze their herds. On the monuments of the oldest dynasties they already appear with their characteristic features: frizzy hair, lipped lips, crushed nose. The Negroes can thus be considered as the first occupants of the African continent, like the true natives. At a time that it is impossible to specify, but which is very remote, since tradition has barely preserved the memory, a first wave of white invaders fell on the black continent and settled in the northern provinces, between the Mediterranean and the Sahara. The descendants of invading settlers from Eurasia have preserved oral traditions on the earliest inhabitants of North Africa. Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Africanistes. 1931, tome 1 fascicule 2. pp. 151-194  Consid\u00e9rations sur l'ethnique maure et en particulier sur une race ancienne : les Bafours Consid\u00e9rations sur l'ethnique maure et en particulier sur une race ancienne : les Bafours.  La TRADITION CHEZ LES OULAD BlERI  [D'apr\u00e8s Ismail Ould Cheikh Sydia3).  Il y a bien longtemps, apr\u00e8s No\u00e9, ce sont les Noirs qui occupaient notre pays : ils remontaient jusqu'au Maroc, jusqu'au moment o\u00f9 vinrent de Syrie les premiers Blancs conqu\u00e9rants : c'\u00e9taient des hommes \u00e0 peau claire et dont les yeux \u00e9taient gris. Google Translate Long ago, after Noah, Blacks inhabited our country: they went up as far as Morocco until from Syria came the first white conquerors: they were light skinned men with grey eyes.  La tradition chez les Ida Aghzeinbou  Voici ce que l'on dit dans ma tribu : je le tiens de mon p\u00e8re qui le tient du sien. C'\u00e9taient les Noirs qui depuis No\u00e9 occupaient la Mauritanie jusqu'au Maroc. De grands Blancs vinrent de Syrie : leurs cheveux n'\u00e9taient pas noirs et leurs yeux \u00e9taient gris 2 ; ils eurent une guerre avec les Noirs et ils les repouss\u00e8rent, cela se passait bien longtemps avant le proph\u00e8te. Google Translate   Here's what it is told in my tribe: I got it from my father who got is from his. Since Noah, Blacks inhabited Mauritania as far as Morocco. White men of great height came from Syria; their hair was black; and their eyes were gray. They waged a war with the Blacks and the Blacks were repulsed, this happened long before the prophet. ",
