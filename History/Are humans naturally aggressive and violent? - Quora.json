            "answer_text": "Yes, humans are inherently violent, as manifested in those situations that trigger our \"lizard brain\" reactions.  Aggression, territory defense, dominance competition, all this primitive survival strategies that you can observe in alligators e.g. are hardwired in prehistoric parts also of our human brain. There is no exception. Usually we are not aware of them them because the mother nature equipped us with with more advanced computational modules (limbic system+neocortex) throughout the evolution. And usually it is these newer modules that are in control. But not always. Take from man his property, job, hurt his family, pride, isolate him socially ...and beast is out. Weaken his neocortex control mechanism with alcohol and disaster is not far away. For sure humans are not violent always. If our major needs are fulfilled and we live in a mature social environment interactively then other survival mechanisms prevail. But let's not make a mistake. Roots of violence are always there inside of us. They are in stand by mode, waiting for an event. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe. There are a few genes that are shown to influence aggression in people. One is MAOA. A gene that is found to correlate with aggression. Furthermore, there is also evidence for a biological disposition in the womb. There is also shown to be reduced activity in the Pre-Frontal Cortex in the brains of some violent offenders (however this isn't always the case). There are other genes that have been shown to affect violent behaviour.      But here is the catch, not everyone who has these biological markers is violent.  So there is an element of environmental conditions that can mediate the genetic make up. For instance research indicates those with more resources have a greater ability at mediating their behaviour and tend to be able to better plan ahead. This is an ability that is found in the Pre-Frontal Cortex, and may grow faster in better resourced environments.  . I'd say we are inherently violent. As a society we quite frequently of schizophrenic views on violence. There is plenty of media that is violent, video games are violent, films are violent. In fact films that have high sexual content in them are often rated higher than those with violence. Our society doesn't have a big problem with violence as it likes to think. It just has a problem with violence towards the group of the individual observing it. I don't think people like accepting biological aspects of violence because they like the dualism of good vs. evil.  Sources to Look Up: Raine, A. (2013) Anatomy of Violence: The Biological Roots of Violence Type in James Fallon and Psychopath into YouTube (or for that matter Adrian Raine).  Also, for more information on Psychopaths see Robert Hare (some of his research found Psychopath brains function on a lower wave length then others). ",

            "answer_text": "Violence is easier to notice and gets more attention than peace, hence why there seems to be so much of the former compared to the latter. You are not disillusioned about the human race. You are disillusioned by a false perception of it. Are we \"naturally\" aggressive and violent? Based on your description, you clearly don't mean that we're biologically hardwired that way, otherwise there would be no peaceful people. You may be using it to ask whether or not we have that kind of an inclination. We don't, otherwise there would be no counter-cultural movements that resist the violence of established traditions and establish more peaceful alternatives. If aggression and violence are so natural, how do you explain post traumatic stress disorder. Soldiers who were trained to kill when commanded get that. Those that kill without remorse represent a teeny tiny fraction of the human population. If it's so natural, then why do central governments have to brainwash people with widespread propaganda campaigns that demonizes other people? Picture this. Suppose you had the opportunity to kill someone. Would you do it? You are against killing, so why would you? Why do you pretend that you aren't human (something more) so that you can judge us all from your moral high ground? The fact that you are human and have the capacity to be against abhorrent behaviour should suggest that others can too if they had the means and motives to develop and express that capacity. ",

            "answer_text": "No, most things a human does is the result of prior experience and actions. If you were to bring up a child to adulthood without exposing him/her to any sort of violence in any way, that child would have no notion of what violence is. I can't say whether that would be good or bad thing(most likely not good). The first time they see violence they might not know how to interpret it. Although humans are very clever and can easily connect dots, so unless you take away all the ways that human could figure out that violence is wrong, they really would be dumbfounded.  EDIT: I've been thinking about it, and my answer above might not be entirely true. Humans historically have had to fight in various situations to survive. Those that did fight were more likely to survive than those who did not. Thus evolution will favour those who are more likely to do violence. There may be an embedded system in the human brain that promotes violence to increase likelihood of survival. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course we are. Violence frequently happens, and the fact that we are capable of it depends on our being equipped by nature to produce it. We have the teeth and claws and muscles of a carnivore and have always made our living by killing other animals and eating them. We augmented our fairly mediocre carnivore equipment with weapons and strategies that our big brains created for us. We then made use of these tools and dispositions toward violence in conflict situations with others of our own kind. All this is completely consistent with our nature. However, we also are by nature a species of cooperative individuals. We can get more done in groups than as solitary individuals or families. These useful arrangements give us incentives to not be violent with each other, or to at least keep it within bounds. In addition, as the tools by which individuals can do violence to others have grown more powerful and easier to use in many ways, we may get to something like the peace that came from mutual assured destruction between the US and the USSR. If even the least of us can bring significant violence to bear if he or she feels sufficiently mistreated, we may wind up having to treat each other well despite our dispositions to violently seize whatever we want.

            "answer_text": "Q. Are humans naturally aggressive and violent? -If one observes carefully, one will see that some people are aggressive and violent while some are not. -Suppose some people hold the view that humans are naturally aggressive and violent. -If that is so, those who blame nature as the decisive factor of aggressive and violent behaviors will lack the impulse and effort to change those behaviors in present lifetime. Other people should not criticize those people with aggressive and violent behaviors, because it is not their fault (to have bad behaviors). -Suppose that: \u201cHumans are not born with aggressive and violent behaviors, b aggressive and violent behaviors are not nature, aggressive and violent behaviors are learnt from the society we live in, nurture.\u201d -If that\u2019s so, those who believe nurture as the decisive factor of aggressive and violent behaviors will have the impulse and effort to change aggressive and violent behaviors in present lifetime. -Let\u2019s suppose that: \u201cSome humans are born with lack of aggressive and violent behaviors, lack of aggressive and violent behaviors is due to nature, and lack of aggressive and violent behaviors is not learnt from the society we live in.\u201d -If that\u2019s so, we should not praise those people with lack of aggressive and violent behaviors because those behaviors are not due to their effort. -In short answer, if we praise the people with lack of aggressive and violent behaviors and we criticize the people with aggressive and violent behaviors, it becomes discrimination by behaviors which those people cannot control. -But if we do not praise the people with lack of aggressive and violent behaviors and we do not criticize the people with aggressive and violent behaviors, there may be more and more people with aggressive and violent behaviors and less and less people with lack of aggressive and violent behaviors appear in future because aggressive and violent behaviors are easy and no need to take responsibility. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, those behaviors are nurtured. If those behaviors are present since birth, those behaviors are nurtured in previous lifetime. - - -If all human beings are inherently bad (aggressive and violent), there is no question for inherently good (non-aggressive and non-violent) or inherently bad (aggressive and violent) because everyone will observe all human beings as inherently bad (aggressive and violent) since young. -If all human beings are inherently good (non-aggressive and non-violent), there is no question for inherently good or inherently bad because everyone will observe all human beings as inherently good since young. -So some human beings are inherently good and some human beings are inherently bad because people observe as such. -So what's the cause of inherently good or bad? -It is not genetic because if it is genetic, science will have discovered by now. -It is not genetic because one can observe that both inherently good parents can have inherently bad children. Likewise, both inherently bad parents can have inherently good children. -It is not environment because even the extremely poor parents with extremely bad environment can have inherently good children. Likewise, even the extremely rich family with extremely good environment can have inherently bad children. -But during the individual growth process (after birth), inherently good children are easier to become bad if they meet bad environment and bad influence. Inherently bad children are not easy to become good even if they meet good environment and good influence. -It is easier to become bad during the growth of children because it does not need much effort to do bad things and it needs much effort to do good. -It is harder to become good during the growth of children because it needs much effort to restrain from doing bad. -According to this philosophy, more and more bad people should appear in the world. Nature favors to appear the bad behaviors. If inherently good and inherently bad behaviors appear randomly, people would see inherently good and bad children in one to one ratio (half and half in population) in their childhood before the influence of environment. Or one should see more inherently bad children than good children in their childhood because nature appears to favor bad behaviors. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism (If one accepts Buddhism as truth, not as a religion), human life is hard to get. Those with good behaviors in past life can return to human life if they are not released from cycles of life because human life is one of good destination and one can work hard to release from cycle of life in human life. Those with bad behaviors in past life rarely come back to human life because human life is one of good destination. So if one who has previous life with good behaviors and the other who has previous life with bad behaviors competes for one human life, one who has previous life with good behaviors has more chance to come back to human life again. If he comes back to human life again, he will be inherently good because of previous habits. So according to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, people will see more inherently good children than inherently bad ones because human life is one of the good destinations. - Reference \u2026.. \"'Do you know how there is the descent of an embryo?'\"'Yes, master, we know how there is the descent of an embryo.

According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, some people are born good regardless of their good or bad environment or good or bad behaviors of their parents. Some people are born bad regardless of their good or bad environment or good or bad behaviors of their parents, too. -That does not mean their good or bad behaviors, attitudes are fixed since birth. they can change from good to bad or bad to good during their lifetime. During the growing period from childhood to adulthood, they can become good or bad (especially bad if environment encourages) according to influence of environment (parents, teachers, surrounding people, etc.). But it is easier to change from good to bad than bad to good. It takes more effort to change from bad to good than vice versa. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, personality is learned as it was acquired from previous life (his/her repeated actions at that life). In one person's life, his/her actions, which he/she repeatedly does, become his/her habits, behaviors, and then become personality. - - (Very) Long Answer (or explanation) Tabula rasa (Children are blank slate) -Tabula rasa, means \"blank slate\" in Latin and originates from the Roman tabula. -The term also is used as the name of an epistemological theory that individuals are born without built-in mental content and that all of their knowledge comes from experience and perception. Human intellect at birth resembled a tabula rasa, a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know. Persian philosopher Ibn SinaAt birth the (human) mind is a \"blank slate\" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's sensory experiences. John Locke-Generally, the tabula rasa thesis favour the \"nurture\" side of the nature versus nurture debate, when it comes to aspects of one's personality, social and emotional behaviour, and intelligence. -Scholarly and popular discussion about nature and nurture relates to the relative importance of an individual's innate qualities (nature) as compared to an individual's personal experiences (nurture) in causing individual differences in physical and behavioral traits. From Tabula rasa - Wikipedia Nature versus nurture - Wikipedia - Fall of the Tabula rasa (Blank slate) concept -Generations later, people questioned about the blank state theory of mind. When observating the children, they found out that the children had distinct personalities, characters, talent since young. Within same culture, within same environment and even within same big families, some children were introvert, some were extrovert, some were easily angry, some had sence of humor, some learnt easily in studying, some had talents in arts, music, dancing, playing piano, etc, some had talent in different sports since young, majority of children had sense of morality since young (they knew what is good, what is bad without learning from adults). -Some researchers even found out that they could predict which children will be succesful in later life, who would complete university education by doing so simple experiment to the children. (The Stanford marshmallow experiment was a series of studies on delayed gratification in the late 1960s and early 1970s led by psychologist Walter Mischel, then a professor at Stanford University. In these studies, a child (4-7 years of age) was offered a choice between one small reward (sometimes a marshmallow, but often a cookie or a pretzel, etc.) provided immediately or two small rewards if he or she waited until the tester returned (after an absence of approximately 15 minutes). In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI) and other life measures.From Stanford marshmallow experiment) - The children are morally good at birth -Regarding the morality, even children under 2 yars old can tell, to an extent, what is good and bad, and often act in an altruistic fashion. (The last few years produced a spate of related studies hinting that, far from being born a \u201cperfect idiot,\u201d as Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued, or a selfish brute, as Thomas Hobbes feared, a child arrives in the world provisioned with rich, broadly pro-social tendencies and seems predisposed to care about other people. Children can tell, to an extent, what is good and bad, and often act in an altruistic fashion. \u201cGiving Leads to Happiness in Young Children,\u201d a study of under-2-year-olds concluded. \u201cBabies Know What\u2019s Fair\u201d was the upshot of another study, of 19- and 21-month-olds.

One puppet rolled a ball to a second puppet, who passed the ball back. The first puppet then rolled the ball to a different puppet, who ran off with the ball. The baby was next given a choice between taking a treat away from the \u201cnice\u201d puppet or the \u201cnaughty\u201d one. As Bloom predicted, the infant removed the treat from the naughty puppet\u2014which is what most babies do in this experiment. But for this little moralist, removing a positive reinforcement (the treat) was not enough. \u201cThe boy then leaned over and smacked this puppet on the head,\u201d Bloom recounts. In his inchoate moral mind, punishment was called for.From https://michaelshermer.com/2014/... ) - -So we can conclude that the children are good in nature since birth. -Or is it? - -(The psychopath since young The psychopaths have developmentally problems in their brain structure since young and it is not their fault to become a psychopath.This weekend, The New York Times Magazine's powerful cover story, \"Can You Call a 9-Year-Old a Psychopath?,\" explored the experience of a Florida family whose son, Michael, was found to be \"two standard deviations outside the normal range for callous-unemotional behavior\" -- possibly \u201cprepsychopathic.\"From https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2... ) - (\u2026\u2026. Michael\u2019s problems started, according to his mother, around age 3, shortly after his brother Allan was born. At the time, she said, Michael was mostly just acting \u201clike a brat,\u201d but his behavior soon escalated to throwing tantrums during which he would scream and shriek inconsolably. These weren\u2019t ordinary toddler\u2019s fits. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t, \u2018I\u2019m tired\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m frustrated\u2019 \u2014 the normal things kids do,\u201d Anne remembered. \u201cHis behavior was really out there. And it would happen for hours and hours each day, no matter what we did.\u201d For several years, Michael screamed every time his parents told him to put on his shoes or perform other ordinary tasks, like retrieving one of his toys from the living room. \u201cGoing somewhere, staying somewhere \u2014 anything would set him off,\u201d Miguel said. These furies lasted well beyond toddlerhood. At 8, Michael would still fly into a rage when Anne or Miguel tried to get him ready for school, punching the wall and kicking holes in the door. Left unwatched, he would cut up his trousers with scissors or methodically pull his hair out. He would also vent his anger by slamming the toilet seat down again and again until it broke.From Can You Call a 9-Year-Old a Psychopath?

Of these 67,000 were shipped from British and Irish ports and the remainder were either locally convicted, or transported from other British colonies.

There are a lot of contradictions. -Human beings are born blank in brain and learn from environment they are raised to become what they are in adult, it is thought at first. -Later human beings are set in characters, personalities, intelligence since birth and they have no free will, it is thought like that later. -Human beings may or may not be successful in spite of their psychopath brain. - - -According to evolution, all the life in earth were arise from simple DNA. First it started as a single cell as an unicellular organism and later evolved into complex multicellular organism. All those organisms are related and evolved by the simple DNA instruction. Charles Darwin was the first to formulate a scientific argument for the theory of evolution by means of natural selection. -So DNA is the life of organism. No DNA, no life. -In human being, DNA of the child of is given by mother and father. The child's external features (physical characteristics) are built up according to those shared DNA. So scientists figure that the internal characteristics (Personalities, intelligence quotient, Emotional Intelligence, etc) of the child must be also derived from the parents. -When DNA makes a human being, mind spontaneously occur in that human and it permanently disappear when that living being dies. - -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, each and every human being has own unique soul and when that human being dies, most of the souls has continual repetitive cycle of birth and death called samsara (not just in human world, also in other living worlds) according to his karma. In Buddhism, karma specifically refers to those actions of body, speech or mind that spring from mental intent (\"cetana\"), and bring about a consequence or fruit, (phala) or result (vip\u0101ka). -If that particular soul comes back to human world as rebirth, that particular human being will have distinct personality, I.Q, E.Q, behaviors, etc., according to his daily routine doings, habits. Those characters are not derived from his own parents, according to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism. -So one human being will have personality, intelligence distinct from his father and mother. In other words, if one pair of parents produces a lot, a lot of children, the parents will find that their children will have so many distinct personalities and intelligences different not only from the parents but also among the siblings. - According to current science idea, all of those identical children must have same personality and not so different intelligence. - -In present day science of genetics and evolution concept, it cannot explain how the identical twins have different personalities, different I.Qs, different characters, different interests, different habits, different behaviors, different thinking processes, etc. Some one will see a lot of explanations with different mechanisms. But those different mechanisms can't explain the initial differences during the first 3- 5 years of ages. Genetics can only give identical external physical appearances. Genetics cannot determine so called internal characters. Those internal characters are determined (inherited) by different unique soul or spirit. -Although science cannot explain the cause of differences in internal characters between identical twins, extreme differences between children and their parents (i.e very, very far from the tree), those differences can be explained by rebirth concept. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, although the identical twins have identical physical appearances due to identical genes, each has different intelligence (I.Q), personality, character according to actions and habits, etc from previous individual's lifetime. So one will see different personality, character, intelligence and talent between identical twins. It must be miracle to see those identical twins have same or identical so-called internal characters between them because they have different souls. But science will not accept that kind of answer because science has no concept of soul and science denies concept of rebirth. -And those extreme differences will be more and more common in society like USA because USA is the land of immigrants and rebirths may (or may not) occur in family of different cultures, different concepts, different values, etc, because one cannot select to rebirth in family with same culture, race with previous one. -Which concept is right? One needs to look into identical twins studies without bias. Thousands of twins pairs were studied by scientists in the past. Or one can ask directly to those twins or their parents if you have friends with them. - - On Same psychopath trait with different futures It is better to make enemy with a wise man than to make a friend with a fool. A wise man will not harm other people for the fear of bad consequence to himself.-Some people have psychopath brain change and personality and they develop into criminals in later life. But some people have psychopath brain change and personality and they develop into successful people in late life. Why? -Because they have different intelligence, wisdom. -If a person with psychopath personality has high I.Q, he will control his impulse because he the bad consequence and he will develop his personality as a advantage to be successful in his career. -If a person with psychopath personality has low I.Q, he cannot control his impulse and he will become a bad guy in later life. -So where does that high I.Q come from? If a person made a lot of learning, studying in previous life, he will find that it is easy to learn, easy to study in later life and he can have high I.Q. (If you find a person with much higher I.Q than you, he may work harder, learn harder, study harder than you in at least one lifetime ahead of you. - \u2026..

In order to clear the land for farming, we must destroy the forest and competing plant life so we can use the land for crops. In order to domesticate livestock, we must employ violent tactics to \u2018break\u2019 the animals and to prevent the natural predators from taking from the herd. We must also protect our food supply from those other humans who would take it from us. Daniel Quinn attempts to analyze this in his book \u201cIshmael\u201d where the advent of surplus agriculture began a series of events that changed humans forever. Howard Bloom takes a much deeper look into the violence of humanity in his book \u201cThe Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition into the Forces of History\u201d. Here he analyzes trends that humans share in common with many creatures in the animal kingdom, and even trends regarding single celled life. From the pecking order of chickens as applied to human sociology to the propensity for humans to band together under the umbrella of a central set of ideas which Bloom calls a \u2018meme\u2019 in order to feel safe in their convictions that any other set of ideas come from non-human or sub-human creatures that only look similar, but are in some way stained with impurity. This is a major theme of many religions: convert and be cleansed of your profane ways and you can become a true human. Yet, even inside of such religions there is often dissent among different schools of interpretation that leads to various levels of violence, from finger pointing and shouting to protests and at times in history outright violence. To put it another way, humans would not be able to survive without violence simply because life feeds on life. We must take life in order to sustain life, be it plant or animal or our fellow humans. Does that make us intrinsically violent as a species, or does that just leave us with a need to be aware, accountable, and responsible for the role in the world we play and tame the \u2018violence\u2019 needed to survive and direct it toward other avenues of release instead of just restlessly destroying each other and everything we see?

You must be grow up strong to survive. It is as the saying goes. The one who grows up needing to be strong might be successful in life and will show the success in his home and cars he owns but his kids will grow up relaxed and will be dependent as will his grandchildren until the situation repeats itself all over.

But don't despair, we seem be self domesticating ourselves and violence, while still there, seems to be trending down. Maybe in a not so distant future we can become a peaceful species. ",

The youngest wants what the oldest has.  The three year old quickly learned that the best way to deal with this problem was to shove his brother out of they way. A quick violent push sent his brother flying and solved the problem. We don't discipline our children with physical violence and from the first time he used this tactic we have done everything we can to discourage it. But it clearly works. It achieves the right result.  I'm not sure humans are inherently violent, but violence does get results and we learn it from a very early age. ",
