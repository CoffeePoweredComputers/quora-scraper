            "answer_text": "We humans as a species most likely haven't gotten that much intelligent. You must not confuse information, or as you call it wisdom, with intellect. We are still being taught the same thing in schools because even though they we invented by Archimedes and other philosophers of the ancient world they are still true. For what comes to centuries even millenia old religions is that they provide people with comfort and many other good spiritual and psychological needs. You gain like-minded friends, coworkers and significant other (read: girlfriend or boyfriend.) Religions give us a sense that this life we live isn't all there is and we get to see our dead family members and loved ones. Religion also gives some of us an answer to the question about the meaning of life. We humans basically trust our old ways to be the good ones. Some of them weren't that great and still aren't but old wisdom that doesn't harm anyone isn't bad. To each his own is what I would say. I have seen some atheists claim that christianity is stupid and why would we believe in a God who does this and that. I say that if a belief system isn't based on harming others and it brings you comfort there is no need to get rid of it. ",

            "answer_text": "The old wisdom is such a big part of us that we do not want to see the obvious, the lack of evidence. This is wisdom told by family, friends, teachers and people who want us good. Why would they lie? How could it be wrong with all the magnificent art, old sacred texts, traditions, buildings, rituals, devotion, and tales of heroism and magic wonders? It can take years and tears to start doubting this wisdom and the entire system protecting it. The most comfortable thing is to never question anything. The consequences can be devastating and even fatal. This wisdom is a strong social glue. It\u2019s very uncomfortable to think some part of you, ideas you keep dear, may be wrong. It\u2019s like the thought of it fills you with emptiness, a vast abyss of darkness. The open wound in a ground from a great tree uprooted. Fear of the unknown. But how wonderful it to become free of superstitious beliefs. Then the real hard work starts. We are blindfolded fools led to the altar by other blindfolded fools, having our reason slaughtered. ",
