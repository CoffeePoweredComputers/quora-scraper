            "answer_text": "The Italians and Albanians have very few similarities. Other than similar looks due to both being a European people, the two could not be further apart culturally. Albanians have been in closer proximity to other Balkan peoples such as the Yugoslavs and the Greeks and you will notice that Albanians have alot of similarities in terms of looks, cuisine, vocabulary, mentality, traditional dress and even accent. Albanians have had contact with Romance peoples and there are alot of Romance derived words in Albanian such as stufa, avion, tren, autopuz/autobus, barxalet/barzalet, etc. You will notice Albanians however also fall under different religions such as Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim whereas the Italians are mostly Catholic. Albanians also have alot of vocabulary, cuisine and concepts that arrived from the Middle East due to being in the Ottoman Empire for almost 500 years. I was at the beach one time and I see a Muslim woman speaking Arabic and I heard her say \u201cdush\u201d which means shower, I could tell she meant the shower as she was talking to her son pointing at a public shower and I was so surprised to hear this because this also means shower in Albanian.

Italians are warmer, friendlier and as hospitable, as Albanians, but unfortunately, they are as poor as Albanians, I was at Bari, I did not even see a road sign, so in some ways Southern Italy is worse than Albania. Criminality and corruption are problems in both the countries (all Italy and Albania, but in this case Italy is in a better situation). Northern Italians are completely different, they are culturally close to French, Swiss and Austrians, they are cold and introverts. Northern Italians are richer than Southern Italians, but corruption and mafia are present here too. ",

            "answer_text": "Southern Italians seem to me like our distant cousins. Their faces, gesticulations, way of living, way of dressing, their musical tastes, their habits, their mentality, the clan based family system, even their language intonation and phonology and how they are despised by the northern Italians for the same reasons Albanians might be. There are also plenty of differences though. Italians have a tendency to be masters of the craft and creativity. Albanians not so much. Albanians are more inclined toward power and confrontation. The Italian is the funny cousin that can fix anything while the Albanian is the silent but deadly cousin that is tasked with the protection of the clan. ",
