Northern Germany too) have higher ratio of Mongoloid haplogroup markers . See the ratio of Central Asian haplogroup \u201eQ\u201d and the other mongoloid haplogroup marker \u201eN\u201d (aka.

            "answer_text": "The Eurasian plains had a lot of horse nomad cultures throughout history, from a very diverse genetic and linguistic backgrounds: Indo-Europeans (Iranians, for example), Semites, Turkic and Mongolian peoples, etc. Most of the groups were loose confederations of extended families, or clans, allying themselves with stronger clans, usually through a series of intermarriages. One of these groups was what later would become the core of Hungarian nation, had Urali origins, but was influenced very early on by Turkic during their migrations, then after they arrived in the Carpathian basin (which already had a mix of people with different ethnicity, the remainder of the Huns for instance) they invited several Turkic tribes to settle, then the Mongols and the Tatars arrived, then the Ottoman Turks and another group of Tatars, and so on. While we do have quite a lot of Turkish in our language (20\u201330%), genetically we are about 98% Slavic/Germanic - with a touch of Iranian, just for good measure, but not much linguistic or genetic relation to Mongols or other Altai groups.
