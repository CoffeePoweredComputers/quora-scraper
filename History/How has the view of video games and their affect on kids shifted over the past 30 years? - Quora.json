            "answer_text": "When I was growing up there was a very famous Attorney named Jack Thompson who liked to call himself a \u201cVideogame Activist\u201d  \u201cNobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hit man or a video gamer.\u201d - Jack Thompson According to Jack Thompson videogames were corrupting our very souls as children and our parents had the duty to stand with him in making sure the games industry needed to heavily censor and stop the creation of certain titles\u2026 even if titles \u2026such as Grand Theft Auto which are rated M shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of children anyway. In truth, I might argue the reason I even sought out to play Grand Theft Auto as a 13-year-old was because all of the noise Jack Thompson made about the games and how it\u2019s \u201cforbidden qualities\u201d made my friends and I talk all about it whenever we could.  (Robin and Zelda Williams) Fast forward over a decade and this generation of youthful inspired children who were destined to become murderers of we continued to play games (violent or not) are adults. My friends who grew up with games have children of their own and are introducing them to their gaming consoles. I have friends who have tattoos dedicated to their favorite game franchises and have named their children after videogame characters (As Robin Williams famously named his daughter Zelda after the Legend of Zelda Game Franchise). I don\u2019t know any murderers personally nor have I myself committed murder. Despite my videogame consumption being on the more extreme end. The stigma of videogames corrupting children and destroying their moral aptitude has kind of gone away as videogames have penetrated our culture over time and gone mainstream and not just the thing nerds alone do in their corner.  Now I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t think being cognizant of displays of violence is important because it is and to be honest games like Fortnite being embraced by kids from 6 - 12 causes me some pause However Jack Thompson offloaded the responsibility of parents to help guide and teach their children proper social behavior and \u2026 well not to kill people onto the game industry and because of that complete refusal to acknowledge the role of parenting in situations where vieogames inspired violence I think he derailed his very message. If you release an article right now that states videogames encourage violent behavior you\u2019ll be met with a lot less support and a lot more eye rolls especially among parents who grew up playing videogames themselves and didn\u2019t murder anybody.  Videogames are a common part of our culture now, world-class athletes such as Lebron James and Neymar play videogames that depict themselves and their leagues. I\u2019ve seen countless streams with musicians, actresses, and even politicians such as US Congress woman Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez talking about their favorite games and how they\u2019ve used them to prepare for their very high profile professional roles or common escapes.  As a kid who was born during the controversial hearings about the mere existence of Mortal Kombat to becoming a pre-teen / teenager in the heyday of GTA\u2019s rise to popularity my opinions of games are pretty cemented at this point . My sister bought my niece a Nintendo switch for her birthday last year under my recommendation and I love that I get to share a medium I love so much with a person I love so much.  That is perhaps the biggest reason for a shift in perspective of games and children , many of our parents didn\u2019t grow up with much direct exposure to games and now we have generations of people who were in arcades, PC cafes, home consoles, playing MMO\u2019s, fiddling with Tamogatchi\u2019s, and yes 13 year olds like me who borrowed their friends copy of GTA without their parents knowing right under their nose and many of us came out alright. the fear of videogames was the fear people always have when something new is introduced to their lives. Whether it\u2019s the fear people had of taking Photographs stealing their souls in the 1800\u2019s, the fear no one would ever want to socialize in person again after the advent of social media and the internet, or the recent controversy over 5G towers.  People fear new things which they are unfamiliar with and now videogames have existed for nearly 60 years with us seeing several iterations of their effect on popular culture from Pacman fever to the current rise of VR gaming and then as we are on the horizon for the next generation of videogame consoles. The fear of the medium is dwindling because our society is more familiar with the medium and because of that, we have a generation of kids who will grow up and hopefully be spared the idea that they are destined to become wanton murders just because they play a game that has a cartoon or graphic violence. Not saying violent videogames can\u2019t be influential but I choose not to blame gaming for personal problems much deeper than simply experiencing videogames . ",

            "answer_text": "Well back in the 90s there was a lot of misinformation. There was a lot of fascination with games, but at least from 89 to 1995 as a kid I also heard a lot of nonsense. From the classic \u201cgames are from the devil\u201d to rumors about the console damaging the tv or even using huge amounts of electricity. People also thought that games caused epilepsy, instead of understanding that screen flashes could affect people who already suffered from it. Nowadays it is just another form of entertainment, although the \u201cvideogames are for kids\u201d thing is still there, even when there are lots of mature games out there. ",
