            "answer_text": "Contrary to popular belief, the Roman authorities at first saw little to worry about in Christianity. They viewed Christianity as just another sect of Judaism, which they realised was monotheistic and accepted because of its perceived antiquity. It was not until they realised that Christians did not consider themselves to be Jews, that the Romans began to feel that Christians should pay homage to the gods, and even then providing Christians as much leniency as possible. By the end of the third century, co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius were alarmed by the powerful cohesion of the Christian communities, which they saw as a rival and therefore a threat to the cohesion of the empire as a whole. This led to the fortunately short-lived Great Persecution of 303\u2013311. In The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon gives examples of threats posed by Christianity to the good government of the empire. He say: A sentence of death was executed upon Maximilianus, an African youth, who had been produced by his own father before the magistrate as a sufficient and legal recruit, but who obstinately persisted in declaring that his conscience would not permit him to embrace the profession of a soldier and On the day of a public festival, Marcellus the centurion threw away his arms, and the ensigns of his office, and exclaimed with a loud voice that he would obey none but Jesus Christ the eternal King, and that he renounced forever the use of carnal weapons and the service of an idolatrous master. The soldiers, as soon as they recovered from their astonishment, secured the person of Marcellus. By his own confession, he was condemned and beheaded for the crime of desertion. To Gibbon, these were not so much examples of persecution than of the regular imposition of martial or even civil law. However, they alienated the emperors and served to justify the eventual severity of Galerius and Diocletian. ",

            "answer_text": "Christ in English derives from the Greek word kristos, meaning \u2018anointed,\u2019 which refers to one of the Hebrew aspects of being a messiah. So, ancient references to \u201cchristians\u201d meant \u2018believers in a messiah.\u2019 Not necessarily the guy we call Jesus today. Just various messianic nutjobs of any cult or religion, including radical Jews. Or anybody in trouble for their religious beliefs. Kind of a catch-all term, this word \u201cchristian,\u201d back in Roman times. The radical, Messianic Hebrew problem for Rome was like fundamentalist religious groups we have today \u2014 stirring up trouble with their righteousness, even being militant about their belief that a messiah was coming to kick the Empire\u2019s ass, so you better not be playing on Team Rome when he does. Rome was an inclusive empire that pretty much let the people it conquered do whatever their religious thing was, as long as they behaved, didn\u2019t disrespect the Caesar and payed their taxes. The radical Messianic problem got annoying enough for Rome to go put down a full-on Hebrew rebellion, called the Messianic Wars. Which had nothing to do with Jesus Christ, by the way. But this messiah stuff had got the Romans\u2019 attention. The Wars didn\u2019t end the wackiness. People using existing non-Hebrew religions, mythologies and philosophical ideas had picked up on the messiah idea. There was a Greek philosophy school north of the Jordan River in Galilee that followed the teachings of Diogenes. Many of the famous sayings of the messiah in today\u2019s New Testament follow the precepts of that particular philosophy. Maybe it was a fun way to mock the Romans or the Jews, this copycatting of the Hebrew messianic craziness. Nobody knows for sure. Several of the cults we know of today used the name Jesus to represent whatever kooky messiah concept they were using \u2014 because one of the Hebrew requirements for being a messiah was that he would be named Joshua, or Yeshua, or Jesus in Greek. Somewhat irritating (but not really threatening) was that the mystic-type Messianics were lousy Roman subjects. We might call them anti-authoritarian hippies or smartass libertarians today. They used oral tradition to share their beliefs, mostly, which meant it was hard to catch them with Messianic writings or contraband. And they didn\u2019t use organized temples or churches, so it was hard to track them that way. And there were still a few radical Hebrew Messianics about, gone underground. A Jew-turned-Roman named Saul came up with the idea of organizing \u201cJesus Clubs.\u201d If he could get these Messianics to join up, turn the other cheek, render unto Caesar his due, etc., then the wackos might convert into just another manageable Temple religion like the Hebrews. Hey, maybe even a competing Temple religion that would keep the percentage of Hebrews in the empire under control! Although some higher muckamucks were leery of Saul\u2019s idea at first, Rome was BIG on using organization to conquer and control other societies. Messianic slacker smartasses? Easy. Threatening? Hardly. Despite 15 centuries to invent Christian tales of such, there are actually only a few instances in documented Roman history where Kristos Kultists were persecuted, made to fight in the forum and so on. Jesus Clubs caught on. The various cult stories got codified, using a lot of the Greek Philosopher Jesus and plenty of Saul/Paul\u2019s ideas, unsurprisingly. The mystic slackers didn\u2019t show up at the codifying meetings and eventually disappeared, although some examples of whatever they were smoking show up in Revelations. The Romans organized a popular viral meme (\u201cchristianity\u201d), turned it for the use of their ruling class and invented the Feudal System and Divine Right of Kings, with Saul/Paul\u2019s copycat Temple religion being the organizational system. Heretical beliefs were the only \u201cthreat,\u201d and even then, Pagan concepts and holidays were widely incorporated into Roman Christianity to make it easier to sell club memberships. More about this was covered in another question: Which Christian denominations have interpreted the bible incorrectly? The tldr here is that Romans weren\u2019t threatened much by what we call Christianity. They helped invent it. They were however a bit testy about various Messianic nutjobs, slackers and smartasses who, if they got too righteous about it, were slapped down just like anybody else. Or maybe crucified. ",

            "answer_text": "Annoying the Gods The Romans were very caucious not to upset any of the many Gods. If you caused thr wrath of a God, you were in deep trouble and endangered your entire community. All inhabitans of the Roman Empire had to honour all Gods. The jews was an exception. They had the right only to worship their own God. The Christians were die hard followers of their own God and no other God. They would rather die than sacrifie to some idol. This was OK as long as they were considered jews. When the christians started to convert non-jews to Christianity the threat was no longer neglictible. Gods who lost their worshipers were more than likely to get angry. Pacifist in the warriors state The first christians were die hard pacifist. They refused to kill their fellow humans. No killing. Never. QThis was very upsetting for the Romans. Their core business was war. The state was founded by Romulus, the son of Mars (the war God). A Roman man could only win status and honour as a soldier (making money on business was immoral) If the Romans stopped being soldiers they were nothing. They had no industrial capacity, no classical education (that was a Greek thing), no commersial skills. They would be nothing. If the Romans stopped being soldiers there would not be legions. No military defense. No Empire. The Romans would fall from being masters to be slaves. A Roman that became a Christian became a pacifist. That was a betrayal and a threat to the entire society. Humanity of slaves. The romans idea of slavery had nothing to do with the racism developed in North America. Slavery were not motivated by race but by the fact that humanity could be lossed. If the Gods disliked someone they would have bad luck. In worse case you could end up as a slave. The christians did not reject slavery but considered slaves as humans. They accepted slaves a members of their congregations. They shared the Holy Community with slaves. This was the shocking for the Romans. Accepting slaves as humans was the ultimate evil ",

            "answer_text": "Christianity first emerged as an offshoot of Jewish messianism. Jewish messianism has its origins in apocalyptic literature from the 1st century BCE, which foreshadowed the arrival of a messianic leader who would deliver Israel from its foreign invaders. This ideology originally gained traction during the Maccabean revolt against the Seleucids. When the Roman Empire established their control over the Levant, Jewish messianism was \u201cresurrected\u201d (pun intended) as a revolt against Roman rule. Following the accession of Jesus to heaven (at least as alleged by his followers), his apostles, led by Peter, carried out the Great Commission, prompting them to spread his teachings throughout the world. The apostles initially focused on Jewish communities around the Mediterranean region. The Christians were originally a mere movement within the Jewish fold, alongside groups like the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Zealots and the Essenes. Luke\u2019s Acts of the Apostles records the first Christians partaking in temple services alongside their Jewish brethern, fasting during the high holidays and maintaining a reverence for the Torah. They were virtually indistinguishable from other Jews. During the late 1st century, the Jews were recognized as a legal religion in the Roman Empire. Therefore, they were exempt from worshiping Roman gods and partaking in the pagan rituals, which, for a typical Roman citizen, was a sign of his allegiance to the Empire. However, during the later half of the 1st century, there was a brewing chasm between Christianity and Judaism. It was a gradual process that started with the Council of Jerusalem in 50 CE, when it was decreed that Gentile Christians did not have to adhere to the Mosaic Law. In 98 CE, it became evident that the Roman saw Christianity and Judaism as two different religions. The Roman emperor Nerva exempted Christians from paying the Jewish Tax (Fiscus Judaicus). The Jewish Tax was first imposed by the Roman emperor Vespasian towards the Jews as punishment for their revolt between 66 and 73 CE. When Nerva exempted the Christians from the tax, they may have been freed from unnecessary monetary burden, however, the Christians were no longer considered to be part of a legal religion. Because they were no longer recognized as part of the Jewish fold, Christians were expected by the Romans to partake in the civic pagan ceremonies. However, Christians refused to sacrifice their steadfast belief in Christ to worship \u201cfalse idols\u201d. Not only did the Christians refuse to worship the Roman deities, but they denied their very existence. Therefore, ironically, they were stigmatized as \u201catheists\u201d! Because they were ungrateful, unpatriotic atheists, they were fair game for multiple episodes of persecution. However, because of the Christian Church\u2019s solid hierarchical network of metropolitan bishops, priests and deacon, the Church managed to remain in tact amid the persecutions. Because of their ardent dedication towards health care and uplifting the poor, Christianity gained widespread sympathy throughout the Empire, especially among the urban poor. Even the emperor Constantine allegedly had a conversion experience. According to 4th century church historian Eusebius of Caesarea, during the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 CE, the emperor looked up to the sun and saw a cross above it, with the words \u201cin my name, conquer\u201d. Constantine won the battle. It wasn\u2019t long before the Edict of Milan was decreed in 313 CE, declaring Christianity to be a legal religion. Sixty-seven years later, in 380 CE, the Edict of Thessalonia was decreed, turning the tables by declaring Nicene Christianity to be the sole official religion of the Roman Empire. ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to the other answers, Rome had respect for ancient religions (like Judaism) but not new ones (which Roman soldiers kept taking up from Egypt and points east). Christianity had a known, new provenance making it less trusted. The traditional Romans already were not happy about seeing eastern religious cults being observed in the City of Rome itself (Isis, Mithra, Dionysus). It also had a theology that made little sense to the Romans: a rabble-rouser put to death as a common criminal returned as the savior of the world, causing his followers to allow themselves to be put to death rather than denounce their belief. That a man could in some sense be a god by itself was not such a shock since their gods created half-gods by affairs and rapes, and since emperors could become gods. The Romans also were not used to religious groups offering aid to the poor. Belief for the Romans was only required to be displayed by annual sacrifices to the emperor, tying up patriotism and loyalty with religion, and the Romans were (relatively) tolerant since they encountered so many gods and concepts about them they preferred to see similarities between them, thus giving gods they encountered joint names like \u201cZeus-Amon\u201d. Jews had been given an \u201cout\u201d from such observances but the Romans saw no reason to give this new group any such benefit. Seeing people willing to die over such matters was both upsetting and viewed as disruptive (even if witnessing such courage in the long run might also have driven some to believe). ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is separated into three parts. Part A contains what the Bible says. If you, the reader, don\u2019t accept the historical validity of the Bible, what is stated will not be to your liking. However, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is what the Bible says. There is no hidden agenda in what I\u2019ve written. I\u2019m simply reiterating what the Bible says. It isn\u2019t dogma or doctrine. Please don\u2019t try to steer this into a religious discussion. Again, I\u2019m stating only what is written in the Bible. Part B is what history says. Turning this into a scholarly work would take many hours and so I\u2019ve not done that. But I believe it\u2019s accurate. If you find a point or two that you\u2019d like clarified, I\u2019ll do my best to help. Part C is both what history says and some of my personal conclusions arrived at after more than 20 years of study into this period of Roman and religious history. Part A The first persecutors of Christianity were the Jews themselves beginning with the killing of Jesus. Jesus (born a Jew) was condemned to death by the Jewish Sanhedrin and sent to both the Roman Governor, Pontius Pilate, and Herod Antipas (Tetrarch/King) a vassal to Emperor Augustus. In turn both also sentenced him to death. Yes, the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate, stood aside and gave only tacit approval to the execution of Jesus Christ. Even though he physically/symbolically washed his hands of the matter, he too bears responsibility. His power from Rome authorized him to deny the execution of Jesus, but he chose not to. The four Gospel writers all agree about what Pilate and Herod did and said. (Mathew 27: 11\u201326; Mark 15: 12,13; Luke 23: 1\u201324; John 18: 28 - 19:16) Within a period of weeks the ranks of Christians swelled by many thousands. The Jews stepped up their attacks. All sorts of violence rained down on the new converts; all coming from the Jews, not the Romans. The Bible book of Acts (of the Apostles) contains the many details. The earliest Christians were only either Jews or proselyted Jews. About 3 years after the death of the Christ, gentiles (people of the nations outside Jewry) began to be accepted into the Christian congregation. Because of the preaching and teaching of what the Bible calls the \u201cGood News\u201d, and beginning with the Roman centurion Cornelius (along with his household), active congregations began to spring up in provinces whose population was primarily non-Jewish. Many people of the nations became Christian. Again, the Bible book of Acts (of the Apostles) contains the many details. Part B When that happened persecution by gentiles dramatically increased. Primarily because the Christian belief system was so utterly contrary to the accepted way of doing things, the \u201cnorm.\u201d But even so it rapidly spread. A few of the earliest Christian beliefs that non-Christians found objectionable were: 1) They worshiped a singular God. Contrary to what most to believe as common knowledge, it wasn\u2019t Jesus Christ. It was the God of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus himself. In the original Hebrew (which had only consonants and no vowels) it was represented in the Tetragrammaton. I encourage you to google it. If you don\u2019t believe me, please read or reference the book, \u201cWhen Jesus Became God: The Struggle to Define Christianity during the Last Days of Rome\u201d by Richard E. Rubenstein 2) They did not permit \u201cpagan\u201d beliefs. None of the old gods could be worshiped. History tells us that Roman rule permitted the worship of nearly any deity. What mattered was political subservience, not religious. But not the early Christians. 3) They refused to serve in the military. 4) Emperor worship took hold in the early years of Augustus\u2019 rule, and early Christians refused to participate, even to the point of death. Part C Wikipedia states, \"Persecution of the early church had occurred sporadically and in localised areas since its beginning. The first persecution of Christians organised by the Roman government took place under the emperor Nero in 64 AD after the Great Fire of Rome.\" Edward Gibbon (Wikipedia) wrote, \u201cBy embracing the faith of the Gospel the Christians incurred the supposed guilt of an unnatural and unpardonable offence. They dissolved the sacred ties of custom and education, violated the religious institutions of their country, and presumptuously despised whatever their fathers had believed as true, or had reverenced as sacred.\u201d Opinions vary as to the extent of the persecution. Some say little, others feel that it was much more. Extant writings are very limited on the subject. What is known is that the earliest Christian never changed their position about what they believed to be true and right. Neither did the Jews or Romans soften their stand. At the same time as these events (late first century and early second century CE, or AD if you prefer) were happening, the Jewish rebellion of 66\u201370 CE occurred and the Roman empire was in turmoil. In 69 CE no less than four, yes four, emperors ruled. They were, in sequence, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian. Vespasian and his son Titus (later himself emperor) conquered Samaria, Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem during the 1st Jewish war 66\u201370 CE. After 70 CE things settled down. Until the 2nd Jewish war 115\u2013117 CE (by ethnic Judeans in Cyrenaica, Cyprus and Egypt), that is. Then the 3rd Jewish war, 132\u2013136 CE came along. Emperor Hadrian crushed the rebellion, obliterated the city of Jerusalem, built a temple to Jupiter on the temple mount where the Jewish one had been, and forbade any Jew to enter the city under penalty of death. At this point the persecution of the Jews by the Romans reached fever pitch, and the Jews either compromised, died, or scattered to the four winds. Why is this important to the discussion of why Rome considered the Christians a threat? Because from the Roman point of view they were an offshoot of the Jews. Neither the Jews nor the Christians worshiped Roman gods. Neither group had collectively participated in the \u201cRoman\u201d way of life. So Rome lumped them into all the other peoples that didn\u2019t bend the knee to them. There are those that will disagree with this assessment. Fine. But the fact remains that both groups did continue to be hounded. In my opinion however, many forget something very important, that is, that as time went along and the decades passed, the majority of those professing to be Christian abandoned the original practices, compromised them and began to fully participate in the way of life that had once been rejected. Because of this the \u201cChristians\u201d no longer felt the wrath of the state or people in general. Move forward now to the time of Emperor Decius in 250 CE. He issued an edict that all people (not just \u201cChristians) should offer a public sacrifice to show unity with and loyalty to Rome. Some \u201cChristians\u201d did not do this, while others did. These events can in no way be construed to mean a general persecution of \u201cChristianity.\u201d Emperor Valerian in 253 CE renewed this edict, but it was repealed under his son, Gallienus a few years after. Rome was wracked with disorder during the period of 192\u2013284 CE. In 285 CE Diocletian split Rome into East and West. Diocletian went after the \u201cChristians\u201d in East hammer and tong, but they were virtually unmolested in the West. The number of \u201cChristians\u201d who were executed for their beliefs is unknown, estimates vary wildly, and there is simply no way to know for sure. Through a whole lot more intrigue, dispute, and fighting that happened in the intervening years (far too complicated to include here), Constantine finally became sole ruler of Rome, East and West, after many, many years of almost constant civil war. He had earlier, in 313 CE, legalized \u201cChristianity,\u201d and in 325 vanquished all foes and assumed total rule. He died in 337 CE, having been baptized while dying. For a short few years, during the rule of Julian (355\u2013361 CE) some persecution flared up again. Julian was a worshiper of Helios, the Greek sun god. He most likely died as a result of a battle wound when fighting the Sassanid Empire. His successor, Jovian, restored \u201cChristianity\u201d as the official state religion. ",

            "answer_text": "So from what I understand, the Romans had a system where every religion had to be filed as an official religion. At first, Christianity was seen as a sect of Judaism. After the Jews successfully convinced Roman governors that this was not the case, Christianity became an illegal religion. The Romans used torture and death to keep their empire under control. Jesus being the King of kings and Lord of lords was seen as a direct threat to the leadership of Rome. The millennial kingdom meant that Rome would, one day, end. You could imagine that Rome wasn\u2019t happy about that. It could mean that if Christianity was not ended, one day Christians would rise up and overthrow Rome. This is a simplified answer. It is actually a bit more complicated than this but this is the best answer I could come up with for this format. ",

            "answer_text": "To a Roman mindset, the primary moral virtues are iustitia (justice), temperantia (self-control), prudentia (foresight), fortitudo (military strength and toughness), and pietas (traditional loyalty to family, country, and ancestral gods). The Christian virtues of fides, spes, and caritas (Faith, Hope, and Love) must have seemed incredibly subversive to the values that made Rome strong in Roman eyes. For instance, Romans prided themselves on being the guys who establish order and law. Punishing criminals was for them a big part of iustitia. Clementia, or mercy, had its place, but that place was second-place to executing bad guys gruesomely. Christians, however, asserted \u201cThou Shalt Not Kill.\u201d \u201cTurn the Other Cheek.\u201d \u201cLove Your Enemies and Pray for Them.\u201d Many of the earliest Christian converts were complete pacifists, unwilling to participate in the military duties of a citizen (at least not until Saint Augustine comes up with the doctrine of the Just War in the late 300s or early 400s.) That pacifism must have seemed incredibly cowardly and unpatriotic to the Roman mind, even if we disregard the idea of showing loyalty to the state by participating in state religious rituals. Prudentia meant wisely planning ahead for emergency and disaster, taking caution against uncertain futures. If the Romans had known about the Boy Scouts, they would have loved them! \u201cBe Prepared!\u201d is a very Roman sentiment. How could they reconcile that strongly held virtue with Christ\u2019s \u201cConsider Ye the Lilies of the Field\u201d in Matthew 6:28? The Christian is to rely on spes and fides, not necessarily trust in his own worldly preparations or worry about the future. That\u2019s profoundly un-Roman. Pietas meant to loyalty to one\u2019s country, to one\u2019s gods, and to one\u2019s family. In spite of their penchant for slavery, aristocratic re-marriages of convenience, and widespread fosterage of children among clients and distant relatives, Romans took the role of family with deadly seriousness. What did they make, I wonder, of doctrines like Matthew 12:46\u201350, in which Christ refuses to see his mother and his brothers, and instead declares that all who worship God faithfully are his family? Or what did they make of Matthew 12:46-50, in which Christ declares he comes to turn \u2018a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law\u2014 a man\u2019s enemies will be the members of his own household.\u2019 That must have seemed terribly anti-family and conspiratorial to Romans, who highly valued loyalty to family members (and even nepotism!), but who often argued there was no moral obligation to a stranger beyond honesty. Rites and Rumors: Like any religious minority, Christians were accused of performing hideous or blasphemous rituals in secret. \u201cHey Antonius, have you heard about this strange Christian ceremony called Communion?! Rumors have it involves drinking blood!\u201d Distorted versions of transubstantiation in Christian rites made it easy to imagine these cultists as being ghoulish\u2014especially given the fact that early Christians believed in relics, and thus kept body-parts of former saints, and they might have met in catacombs to be near the body of the saints. There were certainly Orphic rites known to Romans that involved rituals at grave sites, but the Christian ones must have seemed new and creepy in such locations. Finally, consider how Romans would have reacted to a simple cross. For modern Christians like myself, when we see a cross, we associate it with hope and salvation\u2014we remember Christ\u2019s sacrifice on humanity\u2019s behalf, and we\u2019ve had 2,000 years to reinforce that positive attitude. For a Roman, a cross was a symbol of torture and humiliation. It was a very real instrument of execution, not just an abstract intersection of lines. The worst of the worst, the most foul criminals imaginable, scum like rebelling slaves\u2014they are what end up hanging on crosses, despicable as they were! And these new-fangled Christians are proudly carrying or wearing crosses as symbols, flaunting them! Disgusting! To put in a modern perspective, imagine a cult leader in Texas is arrested and dies in the electric chair. His surviving followers start wearing little decorative electric chairs around their necks\u2026. Wouldn\u2019t you find that at the very least in bad taste, creepy and disturbing, if not downright threatening? Do these individuals worship death itself? They are so ready to martyr themselves! Ugh! From the perspective of Romans, these Christians valued what was evil and weak and unjust\u2014limitless mercy to the undeserving, pacifism rather than military aggression, future hope of heaven and obedience to a foreign god rather than conformity and duty in this world to the mores maiorum. It\u2019s a wonder to me that the really bad periods of persecution against Christians back then only add up to about seven years in total. I would have expected something more like seventy, given the probable Roman reaction! ",

Earlier persecutions were sporadic and often motivated by localized and petty jealousies. The fact that the Christians would not accept a place for Jesus in the Pantheon at Rome, even if it had been offered, did place Christianity at odds with the Roman way and so a collision was inevitable. Ironically, the enemy snared Christians not long after Diocletian by agreeing to make Jesus the only God of the Empire. Constantine started the ball rolling with his \u201cconversion\u201d and Theodosius I sealed the deal when he made Nicene Christianity the official religion. From there, as they say, it\u2019s history. In our world today we have the believers facing both persecution in the 10/40 belt, and seduction in the Western democracies. It is important for believers to carefully consider how to walk in both situations. ",

From the middle of the first century BC, Rome ruled part of that land. The Judean Jews were committed to the resurrection of the covenant kingdom of Israel on that land. So God\u2019s everlasting gospel promise was a threat to the national security of the Roman Empire. Rome solved that threat by convincing the Jews that Herod was the king they had been waiting for. Jesus began preaching God\u2019s everlasting gospel promise in hopes of bringing the backslidden Jews back to the fold, so he revived the same old threat to Rome. The Jewish leaders feared that if the backslidden Jews returned to the faith, Rome might kill all the Jews, so they had Jesus killed to prevent it. The apostolic church went underground to escape the Romans, in 70AD, but they still remained a threat to Rome. Constantine finally put an end to the threat by forcing the apostolic church to join His new ecumenical universal church, which did not have God\u2019s everlasting gospel promise in it\u2019s doctrines.

The bible doesn\u2019t really describe the political conditions in the east Roman empire accurately in the first and 2nd centuries. To do that you have to read The Jewish War by Titus Flavius Josephus a Jewish historian who switched sides and became part of the Family of Titus Flavius the Roman emperor. This book was often bundled with the old and new testament during the middle ages. Wonder why? The fact that a Jewish rebel could be embraced as a brother by an emperor kind of hints that Romans were not the brutes that popular culture and movies makes them out to be. The word Christos is simply a Greek translation for the Hebrew word Messiah. In Jewish Tradition the future Messiah wasn\u2019t a pacifist. He was a savage warrior who would smite the pagans with sword and spear and drive them from the holy lands in glorious victory. Three major bloody revolts and many minor ones left thousands dead at the hand of Messianic (Christos) Jewish rebels. There were multiple leaders who claimed to be the prophesied Messiah. Jesus wasn\u2019t only one. Afterwards things got muddled by Christian \u2018spin doctors\u2019 who wanted to white wash the messy beginning of modern Christianity. But think about Jim Jones, David Koresh, and ISIS to get a feel for how Roman government felt about people who called themselves Christians. It isn\u2019t always fair just like modern prejudice against Muslims but it wasn\u2019t based on some silly Roman hatred of peace and love or religious intolerance. ",

This favour needed to be maintained by rituals and sacrifices, and many of those required participation of all citizens. The proper execution was crutial, because even the least wrong move could displease the gods and all of the effort would be in vain - famine, plague and misfortune would be sure to follow. What you believed in (or whether you believed) was irrelevant, which allowed for a great freedom of thought. I would guess that when the Christians refused to partake in pagan rituals among these people, it wasn't recieved well. From the Roman point of view, Christians were senselessly endangering the state. Not even the philosophers who ridiculed the common notion of divinity did that. (Also, I don't think that the cult was approved by the decemviri, as every new cult should have been, but I know even less about this issue.) ",

Christians take their rights and authority from God, not the state, and statists rightly see it as a threat to their desired monopoly on power. Thus the Mayflower sailed for a new land. ",

The Christians said that meakness, poverty and humility were the keys to eternal life. It was also a foreign imported religion from the disobedient Judeans! Quite simply the Christians were against the status quo of the day and threatened all the systems of Roman authority and control as they understood it. It claimed to be the ONLY true religion and caused great upset for the multicultural and generally religiously tolerant Roman empire. ",
