            "answer_text": "The 7-state CSA tried hard to drag in Virginia, including offering to move the capital to Richmond, keeping purchase of slaves from Virginia legal, keeping competition from foreign slave imports illegal, and hurrying to fire on Fort Sumter while the Virginia Secession Convention was still in secession, offering the first chance to light a cannon to a visiting Virginian. Adding 4 Upper South states doubled the CSA\u2019s white population, more than doubled industry, and Virginia and Tennessee suffered the largest number of battles. If this hadn\u2019t worked, Kentucky\u2019s border state convention scheduled for next month would have advocated a neutral bloc against overland war, which would have channeled the war towards naval landings in the Deep South. After Virginia\u2019s sudden secession, Kentucky continued alone with neutrality for months, then joined the Union side after Confederates invaded first. Even with limited emphasis, naval attacks were a successful part of the early war, capturing the largest city New Orleans, as well as Port Royal in South Carolina and numerous other ports. ",

As with the United States Constitution the local slave breeders didn\u2019t want the competition from transatlantic slave ships and the Confederacy didn\u2019t want to bump heads with the British Empire which was really down on slave trafficking by that point.

However, when the Confederate government was formed, it was dominated by less radical people who opted to retain the slave trade ban. Among the reasons for this: Virginia, a prospective Confederate state, made money exporting its excess slaves to other slave states and didn\u2019t want competition from Africa.The Confederacy wanted support from Great Britain which had taken a strong stance against the international slave tradeAnd, I would hope. at least some Confederates recognized that the African slave trade was even more morally horrified than slavery itself, since it involved people being torn away from their homes and while societies and then, often, perishing on the ship voyage to America.",

You could smell them downwind ten miles or more. Hundreds of people crammed together - in tiers. They relieved themselves onto the people below them, they vomited onto the people below them. And there was little fresh air, so the poor wretches just sweated and sweated, in filth. And they died like flies. ",

Any slaves brought into the country after that would have been through illegal smuggling. The CSA maintained the ban. The last known shipload of slaves successfully into The South was in 1860. Any attempt after that would have been thwarted by Union and British blockades. ",
