            "answer_text": "Only the Legislative Branch (the Congress) can officially declare war. The President, as Commander in Chief of the armed forces does have the ability to utilize the military without a declaration of war in ways that look a lot like war. The declaration of war by the Congress is mostly a symbolic step that says our country is at war with another country. It does permit the President to use the military without further notification of the Congress and it would open the door for war-time funding of the military by the Congress. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the US Constitution, the US Congress is granted the power: To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water - Article 1, Section 8 Presumably, this only requires a majority vote of the House of Representatives and the Senate. A declaration of war is needed to initiate conflict against another nation that has not attacked us yet. If another nation attacks first, the war is on. No declaration is needed for the President to respond with the armed forces. Congress then has time to review the situation and vote for funding to continue the conflict. ",
