            "answer_text": "Massachusetts was first to rebel. Virginia was the other largest colony and despite its distance and strong cultural difference, gave strong support. North Carolina and Maryland went along with this. New York might have been most conservative. It was slow to endorse independence and then NYC fell to the British in months and was held for the rest of the war. Pennsylvania was also slow to rebel, perhaps because of the pacifist Quaker heritage. Georgia was still insignificant and even South Carolina still seemed relatively small and distant.  ",
