            "answer_text": "Lower classes were already under brutal exploitation of Russian comprador bourgeoisie and military aristocracy (land lords). Russia was exporting wheat at dumping prices to the world markets, while peasants in Russia were going through famines in the very same year. For Lenin power was simply a tool he used to achieve grandiose goals for Russian society, nothing more.. Power as an isolated concept had no value to neither Lenin, nor Stalin. Lenin socialized production means and the land\u2026 he literally made it truly social property\u2026 legally, judicially, constitutionally\u2026 it was not a mirage.. it was a reality\u2026 Unf\u2026believable reality. totally Youtopian reality come true. Hard to believe that something that inconceivable was an everyday reality.. Totally other planet, uncharted waters.. no guides\u2026 no maps\u2026 compasses swivelling madly but it was not a mirage. He liquidated the dichotomy (if that applies really) of social nature of production and private nature of appropriation. It was done.. no bs. just done. who did he do it for? Himself? he was ascetic and workaholic.. his kids? He had none! His comrades? They were ascetic as him.. Those who were not ascetic.. didn\u2019t survive. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually there were plenty of representatives of the Russian nobility in the communist project, including Lenin. Nor did Lenin create the conditions for revolution, that was a combination of Tsarist ineptitude, backwardness, war, and terrorism by Social Revolutionaries. Lenin and co. stepped up to the plate when no one was running things effectively. The question implies that Lenin was simply power hungry and used communism\u2019s promise of a better future to obtain that power. It\u2019s impossible to tell and wrong to ask. We do not have telepathy, so given that once Lenin secured power the communists energetically set about improving the people\u2019s lot through electrification, education, industrialization, and health care speculating that he just did it for his own gratification is silly. Maybe, maybe not, it\u2019s irrelevant. The fact that communism drastically improved the common Russian\u2019s lot in life stands, if you look past the propaganda. ",
