            "answer_text": "No. Its essential. Its also essential to understand that the UN Security Council is step one of the whole diplomatic process. Its essential to identify the antagonists and the relevant issues relating to a conflict. The Security Council appears to Americans as a repeated failure. Yet if you examine the results of the issues brought before it, save for one salient issue plaguing the entire globe, those issues have eventually been resolved. The exception of course is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That endures. Of course, it began before the UN was even created. The conflict dives into the world of religious bigotry, racism, irrational hatred, emotional dysfunction, and every bad aspect of humanity imaginable. Yet the diplomacy continues waiting for that gap, that opportunity, for peace to march through as the only real option. The change I would like to see, is that any issue that has been vetoed, that a reference to the General Assembly be automatic and a vote of 75% can override a veto to the extent that it must be returned to the Security Council for a better resolution. I would also like to see that abstains are not allowed in the General Assembly. The countries that abstain should no be allowed to count their vote. To further the independence of the UN, that it move its headquarters to Gibraltar and instead of Britain losing the rock, and instead of winning the rock, that Gibraltar be the city of the UN much like Vatican City is the independent city of a global church or the District of Columbia, supports the Capital of the United States. In this method, a sure conflict between Spain and the UK can be avoided. And a City dedicated to world peace at a famous historic location be allowed to evolve. A change of location, always influences the shape of the discussion necessary in dispute resolution. ",

            "answer_text": "You have not mentioned the context.I am answering with respect to veto in UNSC.\"International politics, like all politics, is a struggle for power\".Hans J. Morgenthau.Veto power was introduced as a trophy of winning 2nd world war . To make it a little bit representative of whole world China,an Asian country, was also included.In the arena of International politics national interest is the driving force for any state.now let us assume that veto power is removed and all the decisions of UN are taken democratically with each nation having equal votes. But are the states really equal in terms of their economic power and resources? No, then why they should be treated equals? . However,this logic is not applied in a democratic country like India because people are not sovereign ,but states are and states will not let their sovereignty decreases in any condition. Second thing is, the states always take decisions in their  national interest ,not based on ideology or theology. Then also,states like US, China will carry more weight due to dependence of many economies on them.So what should be done? UNSC reforms. It should be made more representative by including countries like India, South Africa, Brazil (as no country at present from African and South American continent) . Peace loving countries like Japan,India, Germany can stop military decisions based on economic interests. As UK and France has lost their major power characteristics to a large extent, they can be excluded from UNSC and EU as a whole can be a member. ",
