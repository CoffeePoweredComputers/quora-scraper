            "answer_text": " Germany invaded Russia for many reasons in 1941, all of them bad: Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf that Germany needed to conquer living space in the east, that communism should be destroyed and that Bolshevism was a Jewish-inspired philosophy. All of these beliefs indicated a desire and rationale to invade Russia, directly through the Pale of Settlement. Hitler thought that they just had to kick the door down and the whole rotten structure of the Soviet Union would come crashing down. They thought they would conquer in a matter of weeks and so did not provide winter clothing for their troops. The Wehrmacht conquered Poland, Denmark, Norway, France and the Low Countries so rapidly and easily compared to WW1, pushing Britain off the Continent in the process, that further conquests seemed easy. Many military experts thought Germany without question could take the USSR. Stalin had killed most of his marshals, generals and top colonels in a recent purge, and the Red Army performed poorly against Finland in the Winter War. Stalin was trying to reform and re-build the Red Army and increase war industries, and Hitler figured time was in favor of the Soviet Union if he did not act sooner rather than later. Hitler and his generals attached too much significance to Nazi racial theories. Hitler wanted to make peace with Britain, but Britain beat Germany in the Battle of Britain and the outcome of the Battle of the Atlantic was uncertain. Hitler said he wanted to knock the USSR out of the war so that Britain would then have no hope of winning the war and would make peace. Hitler\u2019s earlier successful audacious moves against the advice of his generals made his top generals powerless to change his mind or correct his ideas and reduced their proper general staff oversight. German intelligence and planners failed to know about or properly calculate the effects of logistic, repair, and supply difficulties, problems converting Soviet railroads to German use, the terrible roads in Russia, the effects of dust, mud and frost, the USSR\u2019s 14,000,000 potential available soldiers and the speed with which cadres could form divisions, use of women in combat roles, the T-34 tank, the inability of German infantry to keep up with armored divisions, and the sheer size of the USSR, the Red Army and the war industries supporting them. Germany invaded because that is what Hitler ordered. I suspect Hitler wanted war sooner rather than later because Hitler knew his syphilis would catch up with him eventually.",

            "answer_text": "Well, Germany didn\u2019t, Hitler did. Hitler had always planned to attack Russia; it was the great villain of his Manichean world view. His basic idea was that Germany, representing strength, purity of will and purpose, and \u2018enlightened\u2019 European civilization; was destined to face the corrupted, Jewish-controlled, Asiatic hordes of communists in the East. It tied into his theories of lebensraum as well, and was the only obvious place with enough land and agricultural potential to feed what he saw as the constrained German peoples (there was a historical parallel as well, as Germanic knights had conquered to the east in Poland, the Baltics, and countries like Belorus and Hungary in centuries past and informed the German romantic tradition). So he\u2019d always intended to attack Russia as his \u201cendgame\u201d. Contrary to popular imagination, there\u2019s little evidence that any of the Nazis truly planned to \u2018conquer the world\u2019 except in sort of extended fantasies at the very height of their power. Once Hitler had Europe on its knees, the invasion of Russia was essentially the result of buying into his own hype- despite the defeat of the Luftwaffe over England, Hitler was convinced that his military was essentially invincible, and that the Red Army was going to be a pushover. Though he certainly greatly underestimated the military might of the Russians, it wasn\u2019t a ridiculous notion. The Finns, a country of only a fraction the population of Germany, had defeated the Red Army, or at least fought them to a standstill, the previous winter. The Wehrmacht had easily pushed aside the French and the British Expeditionary Force, and country after country had shown very little resistance to his will. He essentially chose to bomb and invade Yugoslavia for a perceived insult; and the resulting 3 week delay of Barbarossa may have been decisive, since there\u2019s a decent chance Moscow would have fallen had the Germans had a few more weeks to assault the capital before winter proper set in. So there was a fair bit of logic to the idea that had the Germans quickly subdued the Russians as they had the French (which was equally unexpected, based on the experience of WWI), the British, without any American aid yet, would have made peace and Hitler would have won the war. At first, this looked like a smart prediction, but in time, Stalin got it together to organize men and materiel on a scale never before seen in the western world, and the rest is bloody history. ",
