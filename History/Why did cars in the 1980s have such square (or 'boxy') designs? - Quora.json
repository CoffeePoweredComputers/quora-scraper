            "answer_text": "Many of the answers mention various styling trends and engineering concerns, and you could say I was \u201cpresent at the creation\u201d being a 1955 model myself and having lived through the time in question. I\u2019ve been a \u201cclutch head\u201d since my grandfather had me under the hood of his \u201963 Plymouth Valiant changing points and condenser in the Slant 6 distributor. He had \u201csausage fingers,\u201d but I digress . . . I believe that the general \u201cboxy\u201d shape of vehicles of the time in question was also very much a function of component design and fabrication capability driven by assembly procedures of the time. For example, back in the day, automotive engineers used slide rules or mechanical calculating machines for calculations, and had no Computer Aided Design / Finite Element Analysis capability such as what started to become available in the 80s and more so in the 90s. Don\u2019t knock it; slide rules and early digital computers took man to the Moon. Automobiles were mostly body-on-frame, and parts were bolted on with some parts being welded on. Cars were roomy because post-WWII American families tended to have more kids than now, big woodgrain-sided station wagons were very popular. It was pre-OPEC, and $0.30/gallon gasoline did not force fuel economy concerns.  \u201cRoomy\u201d was important; for example, Pontiac made a big marketing deal about their \u201cWide Track\u201d designs. So in order to be \u201croomy,\u201d cars were boxy. Volvo made marketing hay by proclaiming the boxy 140/160, 240/260, 740/760 as being virtuous for being pragmatically boxy; advertising in the mid-80s showed a sectioned Volvo 245 wagon containing an upholstered loveseat with the rear seat folded down.  Manufacturing processes somewhat demanded components that dictated boxy designs, there was considerably more hand assembly up to the early 90s and that meant parts needed to be designed so that human arms and fingers could handle a torque-controlled gun installing threaded fasteners. What sounds absurdly inefficient today is that GM once assembled and painted automobile bodies in plants in locations far away from the actual vehicle assembly plants, and those painted bodies would be trucked or railed from Fisher Body Division factories to the various GM vehicle assembly plants.   Fuel economy targets mandated by governments and consumer preferences coupled with continuously improved Finite Element Analysis / Computer-Aided Design / Computer Aided Manufacture / CMC machining / Computer Modeled Simulation capabilities created opportunity to make vehicles smaller, lighter, more aerodynamic and thus more fuel efficient, and made them easier to assemble, and with increased precision and increased crash resistance for the interior structure. From a design standpoint, computers and software enabled vehicles to be designed and built with a welded unibody structure instead of a body on frame. Given desired strength parameters from a vehicle functionality and crash survivability standpoint, design software enabled a \u201csoftening\u201d of the basic vehicle structure. As an example, consider the 2nd and 3rd generation Ford Taurus: 2nd Gen, rounded at the corners, but still boxy:  3rd Gen, really \u201cmelted\u201d by comparison:  Since we\u2019re on Fords, consider the Ford LTD from the late 70s / early 80s:  And the last incarnation of its successor, the Crown Victoria:  In summary, styling changed because of a number of reasons, certainly a function of taste and trend, but also driven by economic need to boost fuel economy to meet mandated CAFE mileage standards. A more aerodynamic vehicle profile was a more economic profile. But we can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that a technological revolution in vehicle design and manufacturing, the inexpensive and powerful digital computer and CAD / CAM / CNC software, enabled and facilitated the transition to sleeker vehicle platforms.

            "answer_text": "I have a completely different assessment. The curvy styles of the 80s that exploded afterwards were largely a result of the increase in the computing power and engineering accuracy of CAD systems. In the early days of automobile design, up into and through the 60s, many of the most expressively beautiful curvy designs were designed in clay and then \u201credesigned\u201d by engineers for the creation of assemble-able body panels. Highly-complex seams were very difficult to create drawings and molds for. Getting a car from design to market could literally take years (54 months for GM in 1990). In the late 80s and into the 90s, car manufacturers were challenged with increasing pressure from Japan and their more efficient manufacturing. They were finding that the years it took to go from concept to car were not only expensive, but resulted in cars that \u201cmissed\u201d from a style perspective. The new computer tools for increasing efficiency were extremely challenging, requiring \u201cdesigners\u201d to essentially be mathematicians and programmers as much as stylists. Frankly, it was easier to draw a box on these tools than a ball. BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; The Art of Car Styling Adapts to Computers With tools from companies like Evans and Sutherland, designers could start create models on-screen with very high fidelity and more expressive geometry. These designs were not only were faster to iterate and visualize, but they were also extremely accurate from the perspective of the geometry - meaning that the output of the computer did not need extreme modification for manufacturability. Seams were described by math, not adapted with hand tools. Some companies, like Audi, jumped on this technology, notably with the Audi 5000, whose design was notably bulbous, and drew attention for it, and the Ford Taurus. \u201cBubble-cars\u201d were definitely a style trend, and a reaction to the grotesquely rectilinear cars of the 80s, but they were made possible by silicon. The first steps were cars whose creases traveled in three dimensions, as opposed to bulbous panels whose seams and creases tended to be along a single axis. As computing power increased, designers were able to express more radical treatments, culminating in the whorls and vortexes of contemporary cars like the i8. So it was likely that design trends were definitely driven by fashion, but perhaps the better question to ask is \u201cWhy were the 90s so bulbous?\u201d And the answer is undoubtably \u201cBecause it was possible.\u201d ",
