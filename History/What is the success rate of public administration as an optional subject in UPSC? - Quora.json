            "answer_text": "Dear Student, You shouldn't be deciding for your optional based on the success rate, in general. Other factors should decide whether you should opt for any particular optional subject or not - like the availability of guidance (in terms of material and classes), your understanding of the subject, your comfort level with the subject, etc. Having said so, Public administration was backlashed for past few years. But from last two years, it has again gained the momentum. Last year only, we had almost 70 students clearing from our classroom programme. It has again become one of the highest score fetching subject. Moreover, it helps in GS papers also. Hope it helps! Team Synergy ",

If you feel you like the Subject ,don\u2019t look at others performance. The first thing you should do is to go through previous year question papers to gain confidence. If you particularly talk about Pub Ad , in last 2\u20133 year people with this optional didn\u2019t get high marks. ",
