            "answer_text": "No Pope was ever beheaded in France. The first 33 popes were mostly martyrs until the Edict of Milan in 313, which put an end to persecution against Christians. It never took place in France (which at the time was called Gaul and was a part of the Roman Empire), but in Rome where they resided. I am afraid you are confused between two different stories. You are probably mixing up with Saint Dennis (Denis, or Dionysius in Latin), who was the bishop of Paris in the 3rd century, not a Pope. He was beheaded at Montmartre, a hill in Northern Paris used to execute Christians -the etymology is \u201cthe mount of Martyrs. According to the legend, Saint Denis stood up after beheading, and carried his head in his hands up to a a place, where he finally collapsed. This place is now known as Saint Denis and has become a suburb of Paris, but a basilica was erected there in the 12th century, where all kings of France are now buried (except Napoleon).  There was a further story of \u201cpapal captivity\u201d in Avignon, France. It is said that king Philip IV the Fair compelled Pope Clement V to live in Avignon instead of Rome, forcing him to abide to the King\u2019s orders to ban the order of Templars. In fact the story appears to be complex, as the Pope had enemies in Rome and seemed to have sought refuge in France. Seven French Popes lived in Avignon between 1305 to 1377, and the \u201cPalace of Popes \u201c can still be seen in the city, as its main attraction.  ",

Pius VII was first detained at Savona (1809-1812) and then at Fontainebleau (1812-1814). At that time, Napol\u00e9on planned to fix the seat of the papacy in France, Avignon or Paris. But no pope was ever beheaded in France. These things do not happen, France was supposed to be the eldest daughter of the Church\u2026 ",
