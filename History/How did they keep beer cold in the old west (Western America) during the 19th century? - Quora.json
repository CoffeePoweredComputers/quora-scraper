            "answer_text": "As Logan Stroud already said, they drank beer at room temperature. However, they did have ice in \u201cfancier\u201d establishments. The ice was achieved through two methods. The first was to cut ice from local lakes in the winter and store it in a large \u201cice house.\u201d In some locations, these were cut into the sides of hills for extra insulation. I remember being shocked when visiting Arizona and seeing that one of the ice companies had been in existence since the 1800\u2019s. In the middle of the desert! It turns out that you can make ice in hot desert conditions without refrigeration by using a chemical formula with ammonium nitrate. They would make large batches which they would store in an ice house. In a related story, they also used the process to make ice cream. For years people thought there was something fake with the story from one of the Earp\u2019s because they said they passed the ice cream parlor in Tombstone on the way to the OK Corral. It was later verified by historians that there was ice cream in Tombstone in the 1880s. That means there was probably cold beer also. ",

Though the beer had a head, it wasn\u2019t sudsy as it is today. Patrons had to knock back the beer in a hurry before it got too warm or flat. It wasn\u2019t until the 1880\u2019s that Adolphus Busch introduced artificial refrigeration and pasteurization to the U.S. brewing process, launching Budweiser as a national brand. Before then, folks in the Old West didn\u2019t expect their beer to be cold, accustomed to the European tradition of beer served at room temperature. https://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-saloons/ Some parts of the West had cold beer. Ice plants began cropping up in Western towns as early as the 1870s. Before then, brewers cut ice from frozen rivers in the winter and stored it underground during the summer to keep the brew cool.

            "answer_text": "I am really impressed by the quality of the answers here! But one method of getting ice has been left out. And I will use frontier Los Angeles as an example. The ice in LA came by Wells Fargo wagons from San Francisco in the 1850\u2019s and that ice had come from ships from Boston. But even before then Westerners had at least cool beer from deeply dug cellars or from trenches dug in mountain stream beds. And back in LA, shortly after the first ice arrived, ice was being cut in the local mountains and LA's first ice house opened and on its second day, ice cream debuted in LA. And, finally, in 1870, George Millikan, started importing aqua ammonia, and he soon had his water wheel churning out ice on a daily basis. ",

It might not be what we would call cold but its better than nothing. Fast flowing water or Springhouses were small wood or stone structures over a natural spring source originally intended to keep animals and leaves out of the drinking water but also providing refriigiation. Evaporation hanging wet sheets up to cool areas or using soaked earthenware covers for bottles. Finally, as others have said importing ice from Canada and New England in special trains once the railways were built and in clipper ships before hand. ",
