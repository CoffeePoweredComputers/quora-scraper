            "answer_text": "So the internet was created in late 1969 (December 3rd). While the fr First computer was created in 1946. Bumping the Internet's creation back 20 years takes us to 1949. Unfortunately the first computers couldn't handle anything in regards to the internet, so let's bump that back by 20 years too, and go back to 1926. This is in between both world wars (when neither were active) and all countries involved were recovering. As technology progresses WW2 then delays it, but anyway, the internet is finally made in 1949. Computers begin connecting and advancing, then eventually we have what we have today but 20 years ago. There would be a lot less resources. Things like Google wouldn't exist yet, but there might be someone else with that bright idea. Technology as a whole would speed up and eventually we would have everything we've got now and with a possibility of more. A lot of the resources we use today either, exist the same, not exist or be different. For example, say someone created a site like Facebook, before Mark Zuckerburg. When he then attempts it, he fails due to competition. The same applies to every other site too. We would begin to grow at a faster rate because of this 20 year bump in where a huge technological break through happened. It is also possible we would be on a much greater path as people become more connected around the world. ",
