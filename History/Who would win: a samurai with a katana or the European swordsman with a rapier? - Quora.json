            "answer_text": "The guy armed with the rapier. And now I\u2019ll tell you why. The Katana\u2019s an almost pure slashing weapon with a very fine, shallow cutting surface. That\u2019s great if you\u2019re dealing with a completely unarmored target who can\u2019t physically outrun you from horseback like, say a fleeing peasant\u2019s neck, but frankly, it sucks for just about everything else a sword can do. There also contrary to popular belief, very few if any steel katanas known to have existed until well post World War II, the much maligned \u201cShin Gunto\u201d which were issued to Japanese officers during that conflict. Iron being a much softer, easier to damage, much more maintenance intensive material, by the way then even fairly mild steels. But it gets worse: katanas were traditionally made out of \u201ctagahame\u201d a \u201conce forged\u201d block of iron usually sourced from Korea or China in trade. The western name for this exact same grade of billet iron by the way is \u201cpig iron\u201d and it was usually considered to low grade for use in cutting tools. Western tools and weapons made of iron were usually \u201cdouble forged\u201d as well as far more extensively work hardened. A rapier, for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen one, is pretty much a smaller, thinner arming sword, that may or may not have a standard crossguard hilt you see with most arming swords, or the basket hilt you usually see with foils, eppee\u2019s, ect. It may have a blade shorter then a typical arming sword, but more often it\u2019s about 40 inches, just blade length wise. To put this into perspective, an arming sword is usually between 28 to 35 inches. A katana is most often 24 inches in length exactly, with a curved shape that gives it closer to 19 inches of effective cutting surface. Rapierrs also really don\u2019t show up on scene until fairly decent mild spring and tool grade steels start showing up in late 15th century. So already you\u2019ve got a weapon typically made to a much higher standard, of far more resilient materials with newer technology then that of a katana, that has an inherent reach and thrust advantage that can also slice, slash, and chop, to a superior degree then the katana, and to an at least equal degree to the arming sword, on average. What a lot of people don\u2019t know about about the rapier is that it\u2019s also an exceptionally *physically strong* blade even in comparison to other blades contemporary to it\u2019s time or some modern ones that was narrowed for one specific reason; to make thrusting through armor or into gaps between it physically very easy, all while maintaining the same physical range and cutting ability as many larger European double sided swords such as the standard arming sword, greatsword, broadsword, most claymores, ect. So, already we\u2019re dealing with a sword purpose designed for a capability the katana *really doesn\u2019t even have*, that can also do everything *it* can. Now why\u2019s thrusting important? Simple. Slashing requires angled cuts that shorten your reach and open you up to attack far more easily, as well as typically more energy and time to make an attack. Thrusting lets you put a lot of force behind an attack while *extending* your reach as well as defensive range, with an economy of movement and effort, and exceptional accuracy in your attacks and defenses with fairly minimal risk of injury. It is simply put, a mechanically far more powerful and efficient method of attack, particularly if you\u2019re hoping to cause very serious injuries or work your way around or through armor an opponent is wearing. All that, and the rapier is a sword that is on average lighter, and far more able to absorb and disperse shock from physical impacts then your. The truth is, if we make every other possible variable equal between both opponents, the rapier wielder is gonna most likely win just because his or her weapon allows them greater reacher and flexibility in manner of operation. It cuts deeper. It thrusts deeper. It resists damage better. It holds a better edge. It has more surface area you can cut with. It has a significantly wider flat to guard with And again, on average rapier\u2019s are fairly lightweight but strong swords that dissipate shock from impacts pretty well. That might not seem important to you, but the inability to effectively dissipate shock means a katana wielder needs to grasp their a blade a lot more loosely to allow it to cut with without the impact possibly injurying the katana\u2019s wielder. This among other things means a katana wielder is far more easily disarmed, as well. They can\u2019t grip their weapon in the strongest grip they\u2019ve got and not risk damaging it severely in use like a rapier wielder can. They have to hold it loosely, and that\u2019s even before we get into the other elephant in the room: A rapier can with experience, be used one or two handed, and most modern fencers train with using rapiers one handed. You get more reach that way. So, yeah. With two opponents of equal skill with their blades, a rapier wielder is realistically going to win that fight 95% of the time, for the reasons I jusy listed.

            "answer_text": "In 1599, the English sword scholar George Silver had this to say about rapiers vs a heavier cutting sword that would be closer to the profile of a katana: And again, the thrust being made through the hand, arm, or leg, or in many places of the body and face, are not deadly, neither are they maims, or loss of limbs or life, neither is he much hindered for the time in his fight, as long as the blood is hot: for example: I have known a gentleman hurt in rapier fight, in nine or ten places through the body, arms, and legs, and yet has continued in his fight, & afterward has slain the other, and come home and has been cured of all his wounds without maim, & is yet living. But the blow being strongly made, takes sometimes clean away the hand from the arm, has many times been seen(12). Again, a full blow upon the head or face with a short sharp sword, is most commonly death. A full blow upon the neck, shoulder, arm, or leg, endangers life, cuts off the veins, muscles, and sinews, perishes the bones: these wounds made by the blow, in respect of perfect healing, are the loss of limbs, or maims incurable forever. And yet more for the blow: a full blow upon the head, face, arm, leg, or legs, is death, or the party so wounded in the mercy of him that shall so wound him. For what man shall be able long in fight to stand up, either to revenge, or defend himself, having the veins, muscles, sinews of his hand, arm, or leg clean cut asunder? Now, rapiers could certainly deliver fatal wounds but that was because a thrust wound was very difficult to treat with medical science at the time. The wounded person could function for hours, even days before succumbing to infection and/or blood loss, in a fight that means even if you've run them through they've still got the energy to harm you back. The modern day sword scholar John Clements also found that when cut oriented blades were used in dueling, blows to the leg tended to be decisive and left an opponent unable to continue due to shock, severing muscle and/or blood loss. When rapiers became popular civilian dueling weapons though, records showed a lot more people getting stabbed in the leg but continuing to fight, or even able to effectively run away: Brant\u00f4me tells us that in the 1570\u2019s the fugitive Baron De Vitaux with two compatriots ambushed one Millaud in front of his own house as he emerged (this was but one of three such surprise attacks against other gentleman made by the Baron over the years). Before he was killed in the assault, Millaud wounded one of his attackers in the leg with his rapier and \"caused him great loss of blood but did not prevent his escape\". -Leg Wounds & Standing in Historical Fencing To contrast, here's a 1900 account on the kind of wounds a Japanese wielding a katana inflicted on a British soldier: \u201cThe sword is always carried at the side, and adepts in the use of it wound the moment it is drawn. The fatal stroke, upwards, is given in the act of drawing; and if the assailant is not disabled in the act, it is too late for defence.\u201d In the case of the fatally wounded marine alluded to by Capt. Applin, \u201cevery cut had severed the member it was aimed at.\u201d -The Englishman in China, Alexander Michie. cited in Swordsmen of the British Empire So I'd say in a first blood match, the rapier would 'win' in that it's a quick and nimble weapon with great reach for being one handed compared to the more cut (but still capable of thrusting) oriented katana. But in a fight to the death like on the battlefield, the rapier is lacking in the one-hit shock factor of a cut oriented blade like the katana. Keep in mind that the rapier was never adopted to the battlefields of Europe either, more cut oriented swords were used up to the point pistols and rifles surpassed them as infantry arms. In a 'street fight' kind of situation where the rapier user and katana user may not have their weapons drawn, the katana also has an advantage in how quickly it can be drawn and how that motion goes right into a slash when compared with the longer, straight blade of a rapier. The typical outcome would probably be the rapier wielder running his katana wielding foe through with his superior reach thrusting weapon that unfortunately does little to stop the momentum of the katana wielder delivering a fatal chop and then dying from an infection a week later. Interestingly, 16th century Chinese of the Ming dynasty encountered on the battlefield the precursor of the rapier in European cut & thrust swords wielded by Portuguese merchants/slavers, (which resembled the Chinese jian) as well as katanas (resembling the Chinese dao) wielded by Japanese pirates and soldiers. The Ming military was keen on adapting katana-like swords and European matchlocks and cannons, but European swords were largely ignored.  Ming considered straight blades more suitable for one on one dueling, but a curved slashing and cutting blade better for the battlefield The Ming admiral Yu Dayou commented that Ming dynasty troops typically armed with curved slashing swords were better than Europeans in boarding action melee, but warned against engaging Japanese in sword range. Keep in mind that swords were just side arms compared to spears and other polearms on the battlefield, which Yu Dayou comments will subdue any kind of swordsman. A European colonial sailor used to blowing away Filipinos with cannons is probably not going to be as experienced in swordplay as a samurai emerging from the most intensive period of melee warfare in Japanese history, so perhaps the most experienced swordsmen of Europe just never made their way to piratical raids in East Asia.
