            "answer_text": "The Muslims in Madina unanimously pledged allegiance to Ali (r.a) as the new caliph. Ali refused at first as he did not want to be the successor of Othman (r.a ), who was killed by Khawarij, but he was pressured and urged by the companions to carry out the responsibility. In this turbulent time, Ali (r.a) could not carry out the retributive punishment against those they killed Othman because they were numerous and intermixed in his army. They were fierce and ready to fight and it was pilgrimage time, major companions were outside the city. Ali believed that the first priority was the stability of the Islamic nation that was at risk after the death of Uthman (r.a). He saw that unifying the Ummah preceded bringing the killers to justice. After four months, Talhah and Zubayr (r.a) went to make Umrah where they met Aicha (r.a) who was shocked to hear the news of Uthman's assassination. They set out for Basrah where an army gathered there to seek revenge for the death of Uthman (r.a). Aicha, Talha, and Zubayr aimed at reconciling both sides. The army was a challenge to Ali (r.a) who cannot tolerate any revolt against the state. Thus, he was forced to fight that army in the battle of Camel. Meanwhile, the governor of Damascus Muawiya ibn Abi Soufiane (r.a), and the leader of his army Muad ibn Jabal (r.a), refused to pledge allegiance until the killers of The Caliph Uthman ibn Afan brought to justice. Muawiya did not deny the superiority of Ali and his right to the caliphate, but he saw that Ali should avenge the blood of Uthman than ask for allegiance. Ali tried to settle the matter peacefully by sending Jarir Governor Hamdan to Syria as an envoy, but it was in vain as Muawiya insisted that peace could only be negotiated if the murderers of Uthman were brought to justice. Thus the two armies clashed in the battle of Siffin. ",
