            "answer_text": "I assume you mean the variants they produced in Ww2, like the T-34, and the KV, and also the IS or Stalin series. And this is because of the Following reasons. Sloped armor, although this wasn\u2019t a exclusively Russian idea, that would go to the English, it was the first tank model to be produced on such a massive scale with this feature. Although this came at a cost, crew comfort ability and survivability. There was no hatch for the Loader, or Bow gunner, the Bow gunner had a emergency escape hatch under his feet. If you look to the Right of this photo, and look at the floor, you can see what resembles a trap door. It\u2019s tiny, and you could probably squeeze through there, albeit with bruises and scratches, meanwhile burning.  The Loader for a while, at least didn\u2019t have his own hatch, the commander did however, and if there was ever a incident, say a fire, the Commander would get out first, and the Loader would have to wait to get out. This was fixed on the later T-34, model 1942. (T-34 model 1940)  (T-34 model 1942)  Another reason they were so good, was because of their comparably wide tracks, suited for the flat plains of Eastern Europe, Especially Russia and Poland. While the Panzer IV, Panzer 38(t), Panzer II, and Panzer III, which made up most of the tanks that were first used in Operation Barbarossa, had comparably thin tracks. And could easily get stuck in snow, this is why later in the war in Russia, Winterketten, a special type of track addition was put onto Panzers in order to give them better traction in the snow.  Another reason these models were so good, was because they were bad, now that might sound stupid but this is the logic behind it The Red army army did a field study, finding that the parts in a T-34 could be expected to last only 6 months, and in accordance with that made their tanks, well, of lesser quality, and put spare parts on the Tank itself. Expecting breakdowns in your vehicle, and making it easy to repair is the right thing to do, If a T-34\u2019s transmission fails after 50 kilometers. Just replace it willy nilly. But on a Panther, if your transmission fails after 150 kilometers, you suddenly have a mechanic on suicide watch. And this is not related to the answer necessarily but this outlines the problem with German tanks, like the Tiger, Panther, Tiger II, Panzer IV. Is that they are vehicles that are far superior to Soviet models, however those expensive vehicles will be destroyed just as fast as a Soviet tank would. And the loss of a tank to the Red army, is far less expensive than for the Wehrmacht, who produce these massive complicated, expensive beasts of vehicles. One of the many reasons I can think of off the top of my head, is that T-34\u2019s were neumorous, they were, there was an indescribably large number of them. From 1940\u20131945, was 57,000 units produced. While the Tiger, and King tiger, only had ~1,500 units. So consider this, for every one Tiger, either model I or II, there were 38, T-34s. 38 T-34\u2019s that even if lost, would probably still be less of a loss to the Red army, than the German army. ",

            "answer_text": " It wasn\u2019t that they were necessarily so strong, but they were much better suited for the territory than German tanks. This mainly covers the T34 They had the following advantages: Wider tracks which helped in the snow and mudSloped armor which deflected shots (this was not a new theory, but they were the first mass-produced tank to have it)The tank was able to be uparmored and upgunned over time.Most importantly - they were quick to make and repair. Eventually approximately 70\u201380K were made. The Soviets figured out that at most, the average tank only lasted a few months, so why bother making it to last a lifetime? In a famous quote attributed to Stalin - \u201cQuantity has a quality all its own.\u201d It did not matter if a Tiger could destroy 10 T34s. There would always be more to come. Contrast that with the stereotypically over-engineered German tanks which broke down very often and were impossible to maintain in the Russian winter.The Germans destroyed many Soviet tanks but that is because they were better trained and organized. By 1944, the tables had completely turned and Soviet armor was just as strong as their German counterparts.   ",
