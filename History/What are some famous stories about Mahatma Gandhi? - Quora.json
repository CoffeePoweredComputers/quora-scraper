            "answer_text": "When he was just a child of about fifteen, Mohandas was guilty of stealing a bit of gold from his brother's armlet. It could not have been discovered by anyone, but he couldn't bear to live with that guilt. He decided to confess to his father, but did not dare to speak. So, he wrote a letter in which he confessed his crime, asked punishment for it with special mention not to punish himself and pledged never to steal in future. With trembling hands he handed out that letter to his father. After reading it, there were tears trickling down his father's cheeks. He tore up the note and remained wonderfully peaceful. For Mohandas who expected him to get angry and scold him, it was a lesson which he would never forget. In his own words: \"Only he who is smitten with the arrows of love, knows its power.This was, for me, an object-lesson in Ahimsa. Then I could read in it nothing more than a father's love, but today I know that it was pure Ahimsa. When such Ahimsa becomes all-embracing, it transforms everything it touches. There is no limit to its power.\" ",

            "answer_text": "After the second World war, United nations was formed. Holocaust and other war atrocities led people to think about Human rights. The thought behind forming United nations charter was that everyone should have certain fundamental human rights and ones rights shouldn\u2019t collide with those of another. So, letters were written to all the World leaders asking them their list of human rights which can be considered fundamental and which are capable of ensuring everybody\u2019s else\u2019s human rights (my right to life can\u2019t be at the expense of your right to life). The letter came to Mahatma Gandhi as well and his answer, arguably, was totally different from the rest. He said, I learned from my illiterate but wise mother that all rights to be deserved and preserved came from duty well done. Thus the very right to live accrues to us only when we do the duty of citizenship of the world.[1] In his opinion, therefore, there are no fundamental rights but fundamental duties. What an answer! The man was a legend. Albert Einstein rightly said, \u201cGenerations to come, it may well be, will scarce believe that such a man as this one ever in flesh and blood walked upon this Earth.\u201d Footnotes[1] Mahatma Gandhi Quote",
