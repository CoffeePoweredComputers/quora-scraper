            "answer_text": "Tim Baber\u2019s answer has a lot of truth in it, but I don\u2019t know if it adequately addresses the question, partly because I\u2019m not sure there is an adequate answer. Mengele lived in South America\u2014mostly in Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil\u2014from at least 1951 until his death in 1979. Amazingly he requested a copy of his original birth certificate in 1956 from West Germany and obtained a foreign resident permit, which he used to live under his own name! He even got a passport on the same basis and took a vacation to Europe in the 1950s, also under his own name! Finally, after being investigated by the authorities, for reasons unrelated to his Nazi background, he moved to Paraguay and was granted citizenship under the name Jos\u00e9 Mengele. Despite his notoriety and the magnitude of his crimes, Mengele obviously wasn\u2019t particularly afraid of getting caught. Based on interviews with those who knew him, he was a polite unassuming man, unless anyone brought up Auschwitz or Nazi war crimes. Then he would fly into a rage, proclaiming his innocence of any wrongdoing and insisting that he actually helped the Jews! Mengele was pursued by Nazi hunters Simon Wiesenthal and Hermann Langbein, who obtained a West German arrest warrant for him in 1959. Extradition was sought from Argentina, which initially denied the request because Mengele was no longer living at the address on the warrant. By the time it was approved, Mengele had fled to Paraguay. In 1960 Isser Harel, who had successfully captured Adolf Eichmann, also pursued Mengele and found that he had recently been receiving mail under his real name but was also unable to catch up with him. Given the enormity of his crimes and the fact that Mengele did almost nothing to hide his true identity I am a little amazed he evaded capture, especially given the ability of his pursuers. He died after experiencing a heart attack or stroke while swimming off the cost of Brazil in 1979. Later exhumation and examination of the remains conclusively confirmed them as Mengele\u2019s. ",

The hero always saves the worldThe villains get what they deserveThe boy will always get the girlWhen I am king http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greatbigsea/wheniamking.html Villains don\u2019t get what they deserve. In the immediate postwar, Mengele found himself in US custody. Unaware that Mengele's name already stood on a list of wanted war criminals, however, US officials quickly released him. From the summer of 1945 until spring 1949, the physician, under false papers, worked as a farmhand near Rosenheim, Bavaria. At that time, his prosperous family aided his emigration to South America. Mengele settled in Argentina. As his crimes had been well documented before the International Military Tribunal (IMT) and other postwar courts, West German authorities issued a warrant for Mengele's arrest in 1959, and a request for extradition in 1960. Alarmed by the capture of Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires in that same year, Mengele moved to Paraguay and then to Brazil, spending the last years of his life near Sao P\u00e3olo. In declining health, Mengele suffered a stroke while swimming at a vacation resort near Bertioga, Brazil, on February 7, 1979, and drowned. He was buried in a suburb of Sao P\u00e3olo under the fictive name \u201cWolfgang Gerhard.\u201dJosef Mengele He fell through the cracks and escaped. Life is random and people don\u2019t get what they deserve. Mengele (who mutilated my great aunt) escaped justice. That\u2019s why people fantasize about a next world, because it gives them comfort that the scales will be righted. Sadly, they won\u2019t. That\u2019s reality. Reality is, the world isn\u2019t fair. So, instead of asking ourselves why weren\u2019t we punished, ask ourselves how we can make more of a just world. . ",
