            "answer_text": "In the beginning, Germany had a vastly superior military force, with a very small portion of the Red Army being up to date. By 1945, this has completely reversed and the Soviet Union had a vastly superior military (most up to date and numerous arsenal), with immensely superior arms (more up to date) and better trained soldiers. Once in total war, the USSR had vastly superior manufacturing capability which outstripped German production capacity, and Germany was also unable to fight the USSR at full strength since it had multiple other fronts of war. Therefore, the Soviet Union had the more up to date arsenal and battle-tested troops, while Hitler even had to rely on conscription of foreigners since its well-trained soldiers died in encirclements such as Stalingrad where the entirety of Germany\u2019s front line forces were exterminated. Germans also had incredibly low morale, mirroring the situation in the USSR in 1941, by 1945. The situation had to gradually reversed, and by the Battle of Berlin, the Allies controlled more area in Germany than they controlled in Norway or European Denmark. Germany also controlled much of Europe and used it for resources, whereas the USSR had both a much larger area\u2014larger than a dwarf planet in terms of surface area\u2014and thus much greater strategic depth to use to their advantage. Germany also had less control and more resistance in continental Europe, whereas the Soviet Union had suppressed its opposition long prior to the war with Germany, and even fervent dissidents generally did not feel the desire to go traitor\u2014and if they did, they likely felt it impossible to accomplish. Plus, both sides had huge populations in labor camps to contribute to the war effort. The USSR also had aid from the United States and other Allied powers, and the fact Germany had to fight the Western Allies in Africa and the Middle East and later Italy once these two fronts of war had collapsed also dramatically weakened the German military. Also, it seems Stalin had a better sense of when to retreat than Hitler; while the Soviets\u2019 problem was that they retreated too much, the Germans\u2019 problem was that they retreated too scarcely. Following peace with Japan, the USSR deployed its Siberian troops to fight Germany; thus, in 1942 and 1943, Soviet troops outnumbered German troops 3:1. Furthermore, because of increasingly straining fighting with the Western allies, Germany could not deploy enough troops to defeat the Soviet Union in the East. Whereas it could deploy 80% of the Wehtmacht to fight the USSR in 1941, when the war began, it could only deploy 63% by 1943, and by 1945, this had dropped to 60%. The deaths of troops were also a serious contributing factor to troop strength, of course. The Soviets suffered extremely heavy casualties, and by 1944 only outnumbered the Axis military forces 2:1. Note Axis; coups in Axis countries other than Germany meant that by 1945, they were outnumbered 3:1, and when Germany surrendered, they were outnumbered 3.4:1. General Winter was also a big help to the Soviets. The winters of WWII were especially cruel\u2014too much for the Wehrmacht, more accustomed to Africa and generally warm regions of Europe, to bare. Winter essentially meant offensives for the Soviets; on the other hand, every other season essentially meant a German offensive until 1944, when D-Day and other events in the war with the West meant that Germany couldn\u2019t really handle it. In 1943, the Germans were barely able to do anything except try to take some regions of Ukraine back from the Soviets. ",

            "answer_text": "Hitler's army was much moreover prepered and the morall was high (in contracts to what many says, many of the soviet troops didnt fight so bravely done run away surendered etc.), German army was smaller but more exciprenced, ready and the industry produced less but only good and the soviet produced more but not only good. Whicg means that not as the blitzkrieg wars, in the ussr Hitler had to fight a long war. the soviet economy was able to endor a long war the german industry wasnt. which means in the long term soviet was still left within much force within gradualy low vaule and the german who had few force but good ones was unable to replace the forces it most and so the value of its forces was not anough to winter the soviet forces. Morover, up until 1943 the germans were the ones to attack and the soviet army was to move as a reaction to the german advance. in other words: german dictated the shape of the war and ussr had to adjust. after 1943 ussr counterattacked and because it had anough forces it dictated a situation were it attack the german in a long front and germany within not anough forces was unable to defend a long front. Hitler also had better generals but didnt listen to them. German air force controled the air by destroying most of the soviet air force after the first week of the invasion. However this air superiority was not fully used, because of the weather, because the didnt controled anough air fields in the ussr because of lack of oil and because hitler refused to bomb some of the soviet economically important areas because the wanted to use them himself. Also keep in mind: before june 1941, soviet high command estimated that in 1943 the soviet army would be able to stop a german invasion and in 1945 it would be able to invade germany and win. Ussr planed to be able to win in the long term germany wanted to win fast and because failed had to fight a long war which was more favorable a situation in the eyes of ussr ",
