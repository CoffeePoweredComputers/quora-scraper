            "answer_text": "Several of the Five Tribes were as bad as any white master. They whipped, barred intermarriage, regarded them as inferior, and had harsh slave codes. Cherokee even had their own version of the KKK, the Knights of the Blue Circle. Some Cherokee today are deeply racist, as one can see with the way the Cherokee Freedmen were treated. Several others did not abuse. The Seminole intermarried quite a bit and accepted runaway slaves into the tribe. Some bought Africans as slaves, but treated them far better. They were treated like sharecroppers, given land to work and the profits from the crops were split. Both Seminole and Choctaw had ceremonies to make their slaves into relatives, where the owners were obliged to think of them as kin, protect them and never harm them. ",
