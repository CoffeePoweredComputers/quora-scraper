            "answer_text": "Because we had just won a war with them and they had proved themselves as valuable allies! Also, why invade? To what end? Our troops had been fighting and dying for years and were finally being given the news that they had survived. They had won. They were going home! Informing the victors that had given so much for so long that they needed to turn East and start a new war with their previous allies would have simply not happened. More importantly, \u201cIF\u201d the USA would\u2019ve immediately invaded Russia after VE Day, what would have been the rest of the world\u2019s reaction? The US aggressing on an ally who had proven invaluable in stopping the Nazi threat? Additionally, Russia is (was) massive in terms of geography. What \u201cpart\u201d of Russia do you want to invade? Moscow? Georgia? Armies are used as occupying forces. What section of Russia should the US look to occupy? Remember, we still needed to turn around and fight the Japanese in the Pacific. Many of the European theatre troops would be needed to redeploy. If Russia had one thing in spades it was population. If they proved one thing in WW2, it was their will to fight and to never surrender. Remember Stalingrad? Hell, remember Napoleon?? Invading Russia is about as dumb an idea as trying to invade the US (for different reasons). Bottom line is that the US did not invade Russia right after WW2 because it would\u2019ve been one of the worst decisions, for so many reasons (diplomatic, militarily, morale, economically, ad nauseum), that we would have ever made.

            "answer_text": "All other reasons aside, USA was still at war at the time, against the stubborn Japanese. Soviets agreed at Yalta to attack the Japanese through Siberia within three months of the armistice in Europe. The war against Japan was expected to last for another three years. This is why the war was mlitarily unsound. \u201cGolden Gate in \u201848\u201d - a common saying of the USMC at the time, expecting to return to San Francisco by 1948 American economy was beginning to see signs of strain too. If the war effort in Europe lasted for much longer American lifestyles would begin to suffer severely. Sure, US could outlast the Soviets, but would it be worth it? Would it be worth it to the American taxpayer and American voter? Probably not, which is why the war was politically unsound. Would victory be possible? Definitely. Soviet supply lines were impossible to defend against a powerful airforce, even the German Luftwaffe was able to ruin their day and Allied air forces were several times stronger. Soviet manpower was essentially depleted while the Allies would be able to send German POWs and had just liberated several million Frenchmen with military training too. The war of attrition was certainly winnable and if Allies opened up by several swift victories the war might be over by Christmas, leaving them free to cope with the other war. Just like Germans in 1941, really. But would the victory be worth it? American policymakers thought no, with good reason. Would it have stopped the many wars to follow? Maybe, but the price could well be many other new wars, so the net gain could well be zero or even negative. ",
