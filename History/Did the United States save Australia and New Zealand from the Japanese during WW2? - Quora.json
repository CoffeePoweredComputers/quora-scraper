            "answer_text": "The question is both highly debatable and certainly hypothetical. And as USA\u2019s intentions when taking on the Japanese was purely a response to the bombing of Peal Harbour in late 1941 and any supposed \u2018saving\u2019 of Australia or New Zealand would be unintentional and solely as a response to the above bombing of Pearl Harbour \u2026. as before tht USA had showed no intention of joining the war which started in 1939 and referred to it as \u2018a European conflict\u2019 , which it probably was. And during WW2, Australia and New Zealand were treated as training grounds and places to feed and house their troops and a place to send the wounded and a place for R & R for the troops\u2026\u2026 Australians had a not nice/ derogatory saying for \u2018Yanks\u2019 \u2026. it was overpaid, over sexed, and over here! Also interesting that after the evacuation at Dunkirk in 1940 Britain turned to the United States for emergency arms deliveries. President Roosevelt responded immediately and ordered U.S. military arsenals to send all available war material to Britain. Many in America opposed this step, including General Marshall. Arms for Britain mean that the American Army would be less prepared. Roosevelt was, however adamant. The shipments included a great deal of World War I equipment. America shipped 500 French 75 artillery pieces as well as 0.5 million 500,000 Enfield rifles, 500 mortars and machine guns, and large quantities of ammunition. The rifles and machine guns proved to be of only limited use because the American 30-06 round was completely incompatible with the British 303 round. (This was a problem not resolved until the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (1948). The American rifles were used mainly to arm the Home Guard and for training. . This may have improved with the Lend/Lease Agreement in 1941 and after Japan caused USA to enter the war , Britain still got what was surplus and after US troops were taken car of. ",

That has happened many times NZ and Australia lost and had injured many soldiers nurses in the Pacific War and this War was when theycwere also war weary from the Nazi Facist war NZ lost more men per head of population on WW2 than any other nation Thus for me the answer is No I would also mention that in Rugby and Soccer you can't award the try /goal without looking at the teamwork ",

And the Dutch Navy in the East Indies went down pretty quickly at the battle of the Java sea. The Australian navy, an auxiliary force to the Royal Navy, simply wasn\u2019t big enough to take on a Japanese Carrier task force and had lost a cruiser to a German raider and other cruisers in the east indies. Only the USA had the naval strength to tackle the Japanese navy. ",

The battle of the Coral Sea helped the Australians keep New Guinea. The build up of many US troops in Australia and a thousand US made aircraft arriving in the next 12 months made Australia safe from Japanese invasion if they had changed their minds. The possibility of the moronic Blamey defending Australia without US assistance is stuff that nightmares are built on, even now. Fortunately Curtin was on to him. ",

As to Australia, there seems to be a view that Japan did not seriously intend to attack Australia - which would be as difficult for them to defend if captured as it was for us. After the USA developed its island hopping strategy, Japan had more to worry about. Australia was used by Macarthur as his base / refuge in Brisbane, Queensland after being ejected from the Philippines. Macarthur thought that Australians fighting the Japanese in New Guinea must have been shirking because there were not enough of us being killed. There were riots between US and Australian soldiers, with the immortal words \u201cOver Paid, Over Sexed and Over Here\u201d. ",
