            "answer_text": "Well Prince would never be Sir anything. He is factually royal. Sir is a title given for outstanding act of loyalty and or service of a common subject. That excludes men and women that are Royal. As for ELTON JOHN which is the name of an entity it totally depends on self identification of his natural common law self. If everyone both commercial and private natural entities personal and or strange to him have by him been directed to or come acustomed to recognize him and address him as elton john aka ELTON JOHN (dual purpose: eltonJOHN or Elton John) then it is properly addressed as the Sir Elton John. It is commanded by law that all persons with the title Sir are to be treated with the same level of respect as any Knight and has the right to command common persons in times of action where no other recognizable figures of Authority are present because of their past display of wizdom and good decision making ability.

            "answer_text": "1: Elton John has been his legal name since the early 1970s. It was his legal name at the time he was knighted. In their UK, people can change their names. 2: Actually, Prince is the legal first name of the Artist. However, given he's American he wouldn't legally be a sir. Only citizens of Commonwealth countries are allowed to use that UK title. A good example is Bill Gates. ",
