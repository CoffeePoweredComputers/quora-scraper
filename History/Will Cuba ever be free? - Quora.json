            "answer_text": "Will Cuba ever be free? I have friends in Europe & Japan who are Cuban nationals, and who are musicians, and who travel the world freely and return to Cuban after they finished their travels or gigs. So from what I can gather they are as free to do whatever as they will, just like most people in Europe, Canada, Australia etc (and unlike people in the USA who might be limited to where they can travel). In fact I know Canadians that regularly go to and from Cuba on business, so it is already \u201cfree\u201d in certain respects. From what I gather, Cuba\u2019s biggest problem is the USA artificial (without justification) sanctions on Cuba. From what I\u2019ve read, from non-Cuban academic sources, Castro had initially sought USA aid in rebuilding Cuba after the ousting of the corrupt regimes that had been suppressing the nation since the 1930s. They declined, which sent Castro into the arms of the Russians, and the soviet style radicalism that followed. ",
