            "answer_text": "This image[1]perfectly portrays how dangerous Brazil is. Let\u2019s break that down this iconic, historical appalling photo.  The man in the foreground is the current brazillian president, far-right, ex-military who openly defends torture and dictatorships[2]among other fellness. In his hands there is a box of hydroxychloroquine. It is literally his ONLY plan to fight COVID-19 so far, pouring millions into the production of the substance, even though he admits that there is no evidence that it works. He acknowledges absolute ignorance [3]but does anyway, just because, you know. Whatever. People die, \u201cso what?\u201d[4] Even more, he claims to have contracted COVID-19 and got cured within a couple of days thanks to this supposed miraculous medicine. But let\u2019s continue\u2026 Those people crowding and praising the box of pills, many of them without masks, are some of their current hard core supporters. They define themselves as conservative right, pro-family, pro-life, pro-guns, overall \u201cgood citizens\u201d. Here in Brazil they are formed mostly by upper middle class white evangelical christians. They don\u2019t trust the traditional media, journalists, experts or scientists, and stay informed exclusively through whatsapp groups, youtubers, facebook, presidential tweets and whatever their church leaders say. (Chances are that you know a lot of people in your country who fit this description, so I will just say: yes, they are everywhere and have basically the same rudimentary mindset) But here in Brazil they are a lot of people. Latest polls show that +30% of the population still support the president[5] unconditionally, despite all the death toll and messed up government, involved in outrageous scandals that goes from usual basic corruption[6], to direct involvement with gangster militias that\u2026 Oh, sorry. I digress. Ok, how much is this dangerous, can you put in numbers please? Today, late July, COVID-19 has killed almost 80k people here in Brazil. And those are the confirmed cases, specialists say there is a great subnotification scenario[7] because, of course, we don\u2019t have enough test kits (and did not help that we pumped all the money into chloroquine production) But could have be more behind that outrageous picture? Hum\u2026 Let\u2019s dig it! Here is the man. The \u201cmyth\u201d. In his eternal ongoing election campaign.  Allow me to describe this lurid image: his campaign symbol is the finger guns (in fact, this gesture is the only government plan he presented during the entire campaign. Seriously[8]). And he is graciously shooting down (some communist ants?) while surrounded by white people (according to brazillian own definitions) using white t-shirts with \u201cJesus\u201d name printed. Instant classic. But did you get it? Did you get the message? C\u2019mon, all their followers got it! Well, maybe another context is necessary for foreigners.  (sorry, could not crunch those into a single representative image) On the left, a big orange sign installed over a roof in the Mar\u00e9 favela in Rio, says \u201cSchool. Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d[9]. And now the other pictures are pretty self explaining, right? And before someone asks, yes, they shoot [10]. And shoot[11]. And shoot[12][13][14]. In Brazil, the meaning of school shooting is not what you may think. The president gesture was a clear message to their supporters. Saying every policeman, every law enforcement agent is now a double 0 agent: full license to kill. No need to apologize, no need of investigations, no need of evidences, no need of brains (apparently that\u2019s how this government solves everything). Shoot first, ask later and we have you covered[15], bro. As pointed out in other answers, our last decade average homicide rate is around 55k killings per year, about 150 killings everyday, according to official government reports. 150 killings! It\u2019s like a Boieng 737 crashing. EVERYDAY. Just close your eyes and picture that. A commercial airplane crashing into your country, full with fellow citizens. Everyday. That is our normal, non-pandemic, regular brazillian day. As some of you might expect, +70% of the victims are poor black men in poor neglected black communities, in a huge country with huge poor black population [16]! At this point I may have attracted attention of fellow people who will passionately argue that this level of violence and danger does not exist anymore in this country, that there is no such structural racial genocide, that police only kill gangsters that happens to be poor and black, that highest police lethality is lowering the homicide numbers, etc, etc. Most of those fellows will happen to be white middle class men, living in a white middle class neighborhood, and chances are that they are still openly supporting the government. As long as they are politely arguing and presenting their thoughts, I am OK, but those are pretty rare.  The fact is that homicide levels are as high as always, poor and innocent black people are being killed like always were. The numbers, generated by government and law enforcement, are just piling on other pools (aka: people killed by police, innocent people caught in the crossfire, etc). And the previous crime organizations are just being replaced by militiamen, formed by corrupt police officers[17]that looks, act and do business just like the drug gangsters they kill. Militiamen with high political connections. Just like the ones directly linked to the president[18][19]. Ops. Shh! To sum up, Brazil is a pretty dangerous place for brazillians, specially to poor black young brazillians, like always was. But now crime is being fought with even worst criminals, police lethality and impunity are skyrocketing, so are poverty and the deaths of elderly (but this is good for our economy, COVID19 is solving the Pension System problem, according to government aide[20]). Fact is, we have a serious health situation beyond COVID19 - let\u2019s not forget 29 million people here does not have basic sanitation access, and Dengue Fever, Zika and Chikungunya are not on vacation. We have far-right extremist denialists like all other countries, but here, if the polls are right, they account for almost one third of the voters population - about 36 million crazy people on the loose, feeling bold, empowered and protected by government. Journalists, scientists, opposition and all the reasonable people who dares to raise questions (or answers like this) are suffering active persecution and serious life threats by structures built INSIDE the government. And I\u2019m not talking only about the \u201cOffice of Hate\u201d[21]and virtual lynchings that happens - all - the - time. I\u2019m referring to hard proofed things that are right under our noses, the federal police, militar police, the intelligence agency, the army itself. We are heading in full speed to authoritarianism, in the brink of a military coup and the rise of facism. In 2018 this was nothing but a fear. Now nobody doubts. TLDR; Ah. You are asking if a white foreign tourist is pretty much safe visiting Brazil? Well\u2026 statistically, yes. Take your vaccines, secure your belongings, stay in the big cities, around tourist and policed places. But be warned. If anything tragic happens in your visit [22], great chances are that the current presidential reaction will be: \u201cSo what? So sorry! People die, what you want me to do? I am Messiah, but I don\u2019t do miracles!\u201d or something wise and profoundly empathetic like that[23], the hallmark of all great leaders. Good vibes.

            "answer_text": "That depends directly where you intend to go in Brazil. Overall, the metropolitan areas are less safe, and most of the medium and small cities are considerable safer. The South and Southwest are significantly safer than the Northwest. The Northern and Center-East regions are predominantly rural, and don\u2019t have huge crime rates. In Brazil, violence is deeply related to class and color, with young black males from the lower classes being almost 75% of the murdered in Brazil. Among the white and upper classes, the situation is a lot safer. For instance, just like any big city in the US, like NYC, you won\u2019t go near the ghettos at night, in cities like Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo, you\u2019d be wise to avoid lower class neighborhoods, specially at night. But in the richer portions of the city you\u2019d be quite safe. Rio has a deeper security problem because of the city zoning, where the Favelas (slums) are spread across the cities, and nearly no upper class neighborhood is at great distance from one. S\u00e3o Paulo has a more obvious and traditional zoning, with the central and southern zones being richer, and the northern and outer zones being poorer. When you\u2019re in places like Vila Mariana, Pinheiros, Itaim Bibi, and such, you\u2019re as safe as you\u2019re going to be in nearly any metropolis in the world. The problem with Brazil, and Rio specially, as being the most notorious post-card of the country, it\u2019s that the touristic hotspots are targeted by petty thiefs, who will try to steal a cellphone, or camera, and run away (without any use of violence), so it\u2019s smart to not use cellphones in public streets without paying attention to your surroundings, and not having a camera on your neck. Besides those remarks, and, specially if you\u2019re visiting small touristic destinations, like Gramado, or B\u00fazios, you have nothing to fear in here. ",
