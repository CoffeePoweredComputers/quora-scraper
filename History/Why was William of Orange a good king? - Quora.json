            "answer_text": "William of Orange (1688\u20131702) was seen as a good king for several reasons. One is that he upheld the democratic principles of constitutional monarchy, given that this was also the case in the Netherlands and with the assistance of his co-regnal spouse Queen Mary II (1688\u20131694), he presided over the end of absolutism within the United Kingdom from his predecessor, James II (1685\u20131688), supported by France\u2019s Louis XIV. He was responsible for passage of a Bill of Rights, ended fratricidal hostilities with the Netherlands due to his place of birth, and also presided over peace with France. Less salubriously, however, he was responsible for laying the foundation for centuries of Catholic/Protestant hostility in Northern Ireland over the Battle of the Boyne. He wasn\u2019t perfect, then.
