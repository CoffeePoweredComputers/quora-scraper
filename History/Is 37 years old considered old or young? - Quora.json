            "answer_text": "This is a innocent question, and I don\u2019t hold it against you for asking it. However, your question demonstrates so splendidly the absurdity of a two-pole framing of any question or issue. Be it noted that the two-pole question carries with it more hidden assumptions than almost any other type of question. Reducing any consideration to a yes/no answer completely destroys any nuance or subtlety of interpretation, and obliterates complexity. For example, the question assumes that as regards one\u2019s age, only two conditions exist, old OR young, and nothing in between. In some sense you are practicing reification, in which the words used become more important than the things they represent. A word or a definition is a conscious act of human ingenuity, NOT an act of nature. The reason why people are drawn to thinking like this, is that when people are trying to understand something, they seek to assign ideas or concepts to simple categories, the most primitive of which involve two poles, like this question. All our lives we struggle to make sense of the world, we compulsively strive to sort things out, to comprehend, and to put this complicated world into a \u2013 giant file cabinet \u2013 of categories. And yet the categories are also kind of like prisons. Once you establish a file cabinet of categories, you only allow yourself to see the world in just that WAY. And then we get boxed into one way of thinking for the rest of our lives. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great habit to get into. We need to throw out the old file cabinets of labels and definitions, which are often antiquated and defective, and resist those who are too eager to categorize anything with simplistic labels. ",
