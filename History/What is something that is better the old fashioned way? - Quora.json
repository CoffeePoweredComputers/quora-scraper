            "answer_text": "I think laundry should be dried outdoors if possible - it benefits from blowing in the wind even if it doesn\u2019t dry completely. My own system of drying laundry is to remove it from the machine as soon as the cycle finishes (it gets more creased if you leave it) and, if I\u2019m unable to peg it out immediately due to the weather, I fold it carefully into a laundry basket. When I peg the washing out, I carefully peg each item, stretching the fabric slightly to remove creases. Because I live in Greece, the laundry usually dries within a couple of hours in the sun. When I lived in the UK, I often pegged laundry out knowing it wouldn\u2019t dry properly, but I just wanted to get the fresh air blowing through it. When I brought the laundry back in, I would carefully fold it again and then transfer it to a Victorian style drying rack hanging from the ceiling where it could air (especially if still damp).  As each item dried, I would transfer it to a radiator for an hour or so to ensure that it was completely dry. When all the laundry is properly dried, I fold each item carefully (pulling out creases as I do so), ready to be put away. I never iron my clothing (I haven\u2019t even owned an iron for years) but my kids were convinced that all their clothes were ironed because I paid careful attention to the folding. Here in Greece, I have no garden but I have a rope washing line (about 12ft long) on my upstairs balcony. Because the balcony has a roof, I\u2019ve installed my drying rack under the roof, attaching it to the rafters and I use this for larger items like bedding and towels, using the line for clothing. ",
