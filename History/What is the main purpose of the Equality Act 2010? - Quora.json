            "answer_text": "The purpose was mainly to protect peoples emotions, making it a crime to speak the truth. We see that YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, other social platforms and the system of law has followed up and is censoring so-called hate-speech, meaning speech that can hurt peoples emotions, whether true or not.

Luckily many people are still speaking the truth, like David Wood of acts17apologetics  Unfortunately YouTube is discriminating against people speaking the truth DIRECTLY from the three basic islamic texts, but as I wrote: Truth has nothing to do with this.
