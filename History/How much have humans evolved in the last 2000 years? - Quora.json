            "answer_text": "You are asking about biological evolution. The average human generation time is 25 years. So you are talking about 80 generations. And you are talking about worldwide populations that ranged from 300 million in AD 1 to the 7 billion today. 80 generations in a population that large is too short a time for biological evolution to change things. Anything you saw would be within the standard deviation of the original population. There is simply insufficient number of generations for any change to be fixed in a population that large. By \u201cfixed\u201d, I mean the change to spread over generations so that everyone has the new trait. There has been an increase in the frequency of some new traits over that time period:1. 5 Signs Humans Are Still Evolving Lactose tolerance, resistance to diseases, loss of wisdom teeth, smaller brains, blue eyes For instance, there is widespread resistance to measles, mumps, chicken pox, whooping cough etc. to the point that these are not the fatal diseases they were when first introduced into the Roman Empire in the first 3 centuries AD. The best you could do would be to look at very small, isolated populations of humans and see if there were changes in those populations. You might find changes in the !Kung and Andean or Tibetan highlanders.

It is possible that the ability to survive the stress of urban life will show effects at the DNA level. There are some suggestions that genetic ability to survive certain diseases still exist (some white people appear to be able to be infected with HIV without getting AIDS, e.g., causing speculation that earlier infections may have been related in some way, leaving survivors).
