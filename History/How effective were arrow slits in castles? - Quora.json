            "answer_text": "I\u2019d imagine they were pretty effective, because they were used a lot. I would guess coming up on any building that had arrow slots would put people on edge because you can\u2019t see if someone is standing behind them. Here\u2019s a picture of Athenry Castle in Co Galway, it\u2019s still got it\u2019s outside walls which are also full of arrow slots.  I haven\u2019t been inside yet, it\u2019s on my to do list. This is another castle up the road from me, also littered with arrow slots. It also has a tiny front door that you\u2019d have to crawl through.  But to highlight just how common, and maybe necessary these feature were back in the day. This is a bishops house at the Kilmacduagh abbey complex in Galway.  I\u2019ve also visited a fortified church that belonged to the Knights hospitallers in a town called hospital, named after the knights. Castles and other fortified buildings were basically like static tanks, they needed to be able to put out a lot of rounds to stop the locals burning them down. The castle in my town was burned down at least 4 times by local people. ",

            "answer_text": "Extremely effective, because although they restricted visibility, they gave the occupier almost unlimited time to survey and take aim at their target, with almost no risk of being shot back at.  You actually stand inside the structure of an arrow slit. The floor slopes down, toward the opening, to afford the best view of the terrain below, and the chamfered walls mean you have a wide field of fire, even with a weapon like a crossbow (that most unskilled defenders would be using). A bow-shooter would gain as much as 20\u201330 degrees wider field of shot in the same opening, over a crossbow user, for instance. The exterior view of the same sorts of arrow loops show that it would be near impossible to shoot back through them at the defender.  ",
