            "answer_text": "The vast majority of victims in the many death camps were Jewish -usually complete families. There was no mercy for the pregnant women, the old, disabled or babies and toddlers. The children were murdered soon after the death trains arrived. The men and women were separated but some pretty girls - some very young - were selected for use by Nazi officers in their brothels until they tired of them or the girls became pregnant.. When this occurred, the girls were murdered. In France, when the SS were rounding up Jews, they first took the babies from their mothers and threw them in the back of trucks. There were cases reported of the SS men bashing the babies\u2019 brains out on a wall, in front of their mothers .Other heart-breaking scenes included Grandparents dragging their protesting daughters away as they knew that if their daughters objected to giving up their babies, they also would be taken away. In the end it did not matter as not long after all family members in many countries were put aboard the cattle cars bound for the camps. Among those Jews were a significant number who had fought for their country in WW1. Their patriotism nor their jobs counted, doctors, nurses, teachers, homeless all were sent to their deaths at the major camps after starvation, torture and in some cases, barbaric medical and surgical experimentation. Keeping the Jews company were the Roma people - Gypsies rounded up from conquered and friendly countries and condemned as \u201cinferiors who did not deserve to live\u201d Mixed in with them were Trade Union Officials, Communists, mental patients, the disabled and anyone else who was seen as a major threat to Nazi philosophy. Hitler had made a promise tp Pope Pius 12 that he would restore all the countries in the former Vatican Empire to Vatican rule when he had won the war. This ensured the co-operation of Germany\u2019s Catholic Bishops with the Nazis, and using whatever influence they had over their parishioners - including spreading the lie that the death camps did not exist. Two heroic Catholic clergymen whose names are worth looking up were the Provost Bishop of Berlin. This aged hero spoke out publicly against the Nazis, exposed the truth about the death camps and refused to allow anyone in a Nazi uniform into his church. He became such a worry that the German Bishops decided to have him put away. He was arrested and kept in solitary confinement for, I believe, two years. Somehow he managed to get letters out demanding that he be sent to one of the death camps as an inmate and to pray for all the innocents there. Finally, he got his wish and they put him on the train. He died on the way. The other case is of a Priest who took the identity of a Jewish prisoner during a death roll call, in the hope the Jewish man might survive and be reunited with his wife and children who had been hidden by partisans. Altogether, 6 million Jewish people, two million Gypsies and an unidentified number of dissidents, mentally and physically disabled people, German Trade Unionists and Communists were murdered in the camps. The stories I have been told by survivors were both heart-breaking and the stuff of nightmares. In addition, Croatia, a country not just aligned with Nazi Germany, but with its own SS Commanders and officers, brutally massacred two million Serbian people- a Slavic race considered to be \u201csub-human\u201d The Ustashi controlled the Croatian Government, army and Police. A significant number of the SS Officers were Catholic Priests and Ustashi itself was publicly praised and encouraged by Pius 12. The leading Ustashi war criminals basically all escaped to South America on fake refugee passports believed to have been provided by the Vatican. One gut-wrenching story relates to a Ustashi leader being given a \u201cgift\u201d -a large bin filled with 40,000 eyes gouged from Serbian prisoners. Serbian prisoners who survived were sent to the nearest death camp for disposal but there is no accurate count of the numbers shipped to the camp(s). I have gone into greater detail than your question really required because, with the growth of right wing fascism today, often masked by apparent religious beliefs -both Christian and Islamic, today\u2019s younger people need to be told what can happen when the wrong Presidents, Kings, Prime Ministers, Dictators gain control. In the blink of an eye laws can be passed making truth-telling a reason for torture and imprisonment (e.g. the USA/UK and Julian Assange) and loss of privacy enforced as being in the national interest. It is a small step from there to all of us having our freedoms lost, our rights taken away and our lives controlled and governed by those who control the military, the law enforcement, the money/job market and the media. George Orwell\u2019s prophetic book \u201c1984\u201d has all but arrived. May God help us. ",

            "answer_text": "There were a few overarching groups Hitler disliked, Catholics, Roma, \u201cAntisocial people\u201d (gay), Disabled people. He also sent huge numbers of Poles to the camps (many were in Poland) because he generally was sending people he saw as Slavs. Notably he wasn\u2019t sending Slavs as a whole because he had a weird way of viewing them so for example Lithuania was seen as Slav but Estonia and Latvia were Arian. Croatia was Arian but the rest of Yugoslavia were Slavs. So while you can generally say that Slavs were sent to camps it should be said \u201cpeople who Hitler considered Slavs\u201d other than that there were a lot of political opponents and POW\u2019s ",
