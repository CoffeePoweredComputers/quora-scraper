            "answer_text": "They had one of several options. Majority of armies on long campaigns carried supplies with them. There were long supply trains of carts, animals for slaughter, chickens for eggs, grains, pots, oil, other necessities. The supply trains of big armies are described in literature and accounts as being miles long. They had their own set of attendants and guards and their positions were strategic as their loss meant starvation for the army. Most armies were very slow when loaded down with an unwieldy supply train. They also had to be aware of sabotage, enemy attacks on the supplies. Stolen supplies usually aided enemy troops. Most army soldiers also carried a few days or at least a days worth of food with them for emergencies and in case of ambushes or if the troops were scattered. The irregular soldiers and archer Corp usually went hunting for rabbits, pheasants, wild game like squirrels etc to supplement food stocks. Another option was to strip the countryside and either pay for or forcefully take supplies from villages, towns on the way. If traveling through home turf or allied territory there would usually be supply stations, relay posts and soldiers or commanders could pay for extra stuff. In case of enemy territory they usually sacked or looted towns and villages on the way or in case of more lawful armies they took half the stores at the place and left the population with the other half. Horses, cart ponies, oxen etc were both beasts of labor as well as food in case of emergencies. Light troops that depended on speed such as the Mongols had supplies like nuts, dates, raisins etc that'd last a long time without spoiling. ",

            "answer_text": "That was always the problem of armies, ancient and modern. They were alway rapacious of the local livestock and crops. They drove cattle and sheep behind the army to feed it. The ones from nations that had food preservation technology carried food with them. The Japanese army did not solve this problem either and the inept high command simpley dismissed it by putting the responsibility on the army commander. That forced the Japanese to starve the locals in every country they invaded and made them immensely unpopular. The German army had that problem in the Soviet Union because the Russians practiced scorched earth policies to deny them any local foodstuff. They didn\u2019t re-guage Russian railroads so all supplies had to be re-loaded by hand on to Russian trains. Partisons kept blowing up the bridges and the German army only got ten percent of the supplies needed to keep it fully functional. That made a huge difference on its effectiveness. ",
