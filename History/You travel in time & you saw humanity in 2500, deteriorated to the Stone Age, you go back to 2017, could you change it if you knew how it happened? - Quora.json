I wouldn\u2019t tell people I went to the future since people would think I\u2019m crazy. I would start a career in politics if something in my timeline cause it and I could stop it. If I would get a bunch of modern books about medicine,architecture,farming,technology and etc. I would tell my children to keep it safe and add new ones if new advances occur. Hopefully it will be safe until 2500 and society could use the knowledge to advance. ",
