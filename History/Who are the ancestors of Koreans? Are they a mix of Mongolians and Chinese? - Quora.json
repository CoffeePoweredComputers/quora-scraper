No. Korean and Japanese are genetically most similar. They share huge portion of Haplogroup O2b and mtDNA similarities. Haplogroup O2b is not found in Han Chinese. But eastern chinese are genetically similar to Korean and Japanese. Are they mixed with Mongolians? No. Genes specifically found in Mongolian like Haplogroup C3 is not found in Korean. But North Korean might have mixed with Manchurians. Are they mixed with Manhurians? No, but it is the other way round. Manchurian are mixture of Korean, Siberian Ugric and Mongolic DNA.

It is not just Korean share blood with Mongolians. Are Koreans more related to North Asians than other East Asians? Yes, they are slightly more related to North Asians than Northern Han Chinese. Japanese mixed with Jomon and Ainu who are another Paleo Siberian group. Is Korea language related to Mongolian or Chinese language? Because of close proximity, there might be language influence from Mongolian. Altaic language theory links them together. Chinese belongs to Sino Tibetan language family. It is completely different from Korean. But there is Sino Korean vocabulary borrowed from Chinese as loanwords. Are they mixed with Han Chinese? Yes. Korean and Japanese have Han Chinese related DNA component. Haplogroup O3 is found in Korean, Mongolian and surprisingly Kazakhs perhaps from Dungan people.

            "answer_text": "Korean ancestors are at least three branches of tribes which are distinct from Chinese (Han Chinese) and Mongolians. Ye tribe (\uc608\uc871) and Maek tribe (\ub9e5\uc871) are the top 2 tribes of ancestors of Koreans. They came from northern areas like Manchuria or near Mongolia. They\u2019re thought to be subgroups of Buyeo or Fuyu people who lived in Manchuria in the ancient time. Another one is Han or Jin people (\ud55c\uc778 or \uc9c4\uc778) on the southern part of the Korean peninsula. They are considered the same or at least very close people of Yayoi who emerged in Japanese archipelago later after migration into there. However, specific features of them are not known unlike northern peoples. Ye and Maek became like one tribe as Yemaek (\uc608\ub9e5) later, and they were the main group of people in northern part of the Korean peninsula and Manchuria. They later became main people of Goguryeo. As the got strong, they reached the southern part of the peninsula, and started building their own states so called \u201cSamhan (Three Hans)\u201d of Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan. It is often believed that they ruled the naive Han people, and later, assimilated them. By doing so, they became what we call \u201cKorean\u201d with at least three major branches of tribes. Nowadays, North Korea puts an emphasis on their identity as Joseon from Yemaek, but South Korea emphasizes on their identity as Han people. We can see this in their national names. North Korea is \u201c\uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d\u201d in the local official name that has \u201c\uc870\uc120 (Joseon/Choson)\u201d, that has its root with Yemaek people. On the other hand, South Korea is \u201c\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d\u201d in the local official name that has the name \u201c\ud55c (Han)\u201d. For your information, \u201cHan Chinese (\u6f22)\u201d is not related with \u201cHan (\u97d3)\u201d in the Korean peninsula at all. They\u2019re just homonyms. \u6f22 of China has its identity as the main group of Chinese, but \u97d3 of Korea was used just to write the sound *xan that was spoken by the southern native on the peninsula.
