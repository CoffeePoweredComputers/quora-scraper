            "answer_text": "Before proceeding you should know that war and economy are closely linked as many studies have shown. Russia and China have been making joint military exercises since 2013, and they share a lot of interests. Both nations have been arming up lately, i.e. investing huge sums of money in development of military technology. Both nations are preparing their populations for war: Russia: In January 2017 national Russian TV used an entire evening for the discussion: \u201cIf USA and Russia get into war, who will win?\u201d A survey has shown that 85% of the young generation, who is going to fight a possible war, supports Putin - mainly because they haven\u2019t experienced the hardship of the Sovjet Union and also because they have limited access to information, which is skeptic to Putin\u2019s rule. Children and young people receive training in military disciplines like e.g. the use of weapon in a scout-like organization similar to Nazi Germany\u2019s \u201cHitler Jugend\u201d. Finally Russia is in a war-like state due to its engagement in Ukraine and Syria.China: Last year Xi Jinping made a speach to 2 million Chinese soldiers urging them to be ready for war at short notice. The Chinese state is infamous for its investment in education of computer hackers. The philosophy is: If you can paralyze the enemy\u2019s information systems, his military forces will be of no use. And China is constantly trying to expand its territory in Asia.Both Russia and China have increasing economic problems. In Russia the reason for the crisis is twofold: International sanctions and the fact that the Russian state prevents small and medium-sized enterprises to develop and have success. Real democracy is a precondition for such enterprises and hence economic growth. In China the economical statistics look good, but they do not show the situation in the huge \u201cshadow economy\u201d, where nothing is registered. Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China threatens the Chinese rulers\u2019 political power positions. Both Russia and China are ruled without real democracy. The populations in both nations have accepted Putin and Jinping as dictators, as long as they are able to provide stability and jobs in return. Once this deal is no longer fulfilled, everything can happen - and the political rulers in both nations are extremely aware of it. As for military Russia and China are not as strong as the NATO countries, when it comes to military muscles - but we are living in the information age, where muscles don\u2019t count as much as brains, i.e. the ability to use information technology. Besides, both Russia and China may have developed new weapon systems not yet known by NATO. The nuclear arsenals in NATO are no guarantee for victory in a war. We know from history that smaller and weaker nations have been able to win over much bigger and stronger nations - like when Alexander the Great defeated Persian emperor Darius III. Or when Israel won the 6-Days War. The most worrying factor in this card game is Donald Trump. His unpredictability, his willingness to alienate USA\u2019s allies and embrace USA\u2019s enemies, his ignorance about historical facts, his wish to save money on military for money\u2019s sake together with his narcisism have made the world a much more unsafe place than under any previous American administration. If Donald Trump does as he has promised and proceeds to have a summit with Vladimir Putin similar to the meeting that Trump had with Kim Jong-Un - with the only purpose of having a photo opportunity to make him popular with his constituents - then the world will be on the brink of nuclear war, because that means USA has stopped to be vigilant. Right now nobody in America seems to be able to effectively control Donald Trump before the mid-term elections November 6th 2018, because Donald Trump controls the Republicans, and the Reupblicans are in majority in both the Congress and the Senate.
