            "answer_text": "Cinnamon comes from the tree bark . People use the bark of Cinnamomum verum to make medicine or spices in India and most countries. Cinnamon bark is used for gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and gas. It is also used for stimulating appetite; for infections caused by bacteria and parasitic worms; and for the common cold, and the flu (influenza). In foods, cinnamon is used as a spice and as a flavoring agent in beverages. In manufacturing, cinnamon oil is used in small amounts in toothpaste, mouthwashes, gargles, lotions, liniments, soaps, detergents, and other pharmaceutical products and cosmetics. There are different types of cinnamon. Cinnamomum verum (Ceylon cinnamon) and Cinnamomum aromaticum (Cassia cinnamon or Chinese cinnamon) are commonly used. In many cases, the cinnamon spice purchased in food stores contains a combination of these different types of cinnamon.  ",
