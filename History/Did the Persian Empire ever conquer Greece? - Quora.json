            "answer_text": "No. But they easily could have. Not in the 480s or 470s, when Greece was united against them. It was during this period where battles such as Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea were fought. To say the Persians could have conquered Greece during this time period would be a stretch, at the least. After the failure of direct military assault, the Persians under Artaxerxes I (who also happened to be the \u201cConstantine of Zoroastrianism\u201d in the empire), tried a new approach. They decided to fund the enemies of Athens (especially Sparta), so that the Greeks would destroy themselves. They also opened themselves up as a haven for Greek political exiles and refugees. Slowly, thousands of Greeks began peacefully emigrating to the Persian Empire (including Themistocles, the victorious general at Salamis!). The plan of dividing the Greek states against themselves also worked beautifully, being one of the major factors in the Peloponnesian War. Athens and Sparta destroyed each other in that war, with each side destroying the others\u2019 navy in the battles of Arginusae and Aegospotami respectively. By 404BC, Greece was in shambles, and the Golden Age of Persia, under the rule of Artaxerxes II, was just beginning. Artaxerxes II built lavish palaces at Persepolis and (less famously) at Ecbatana. The empire was extended in every direction, including the capture of the last Greek Colonies in Asia Minor and Greek colonies all over the Mediterranean. The Spartans, under their great king Agesilaus II, decided to invade Asia Minor. The Persians just toyed with the Spartan Army, bribing rivals back at home to attack Sparta. Without a fight, they Persians erased every gain the Spartans had made in their invasion. When the Persians wanted this petty Greek squabble to end, it ended, in the Persian negotiated peace of Antalcidas in 387 BC. If at this moment the Persians had decided to invade Greece, they would almost certainly have been victorious. The Persians had utterly divided Greece, and were de facto managing the country\u2019s affairs. All the great Greek commanders were dead, mostly killed in the Peloponnesian War. The only reason that invasion did not come at about this time is because of Persian internal trouble: Egypt under Nectanebo II was in revolt, and initially he was winning victories left and right. Then the full might of the Persians arrived: the mercenary Greek commander, Mentor of Rhodes was bribed away from Nectanebo\u2019s side, the city of Sidon was sacked, and within a few years, the rebellion was crushed (in the 343BC Battle of Pelusium). But Persia\u2019s golden opportunity, a thin gap between 404BC and ~350BC, had faded. The Egyptian War had been a huge tax drain, and the Greek city-states were slowly re-uniting themselves. The old powers of Sparta and Athens were fading, replaced by the new force of Thebes, under its legendary general Epaminondas. It was believed that invading Greece simply wasn\u2019t worth the effort, and the money, plus, Greece was already effectively neutralized. Beside the occasional group of mercenaries (easily bribable), it was locked in internal strife. The Persian Empire too was in no better state: it was rotting from the inner core, and Alexander the Great would eventually topple the whole thing over. In Summary, while united during the early 400s BC, Greece was unconquerable. But when the Persians split Greece, locking it in internal war, it was a sitting duck. The only reason the Persians couldn\u2019t capitalize on this weakening of Greece was because of internal issues, such as the Revolt in Egypt. The one who would capitalize on the fragility of Greece, due to a large part because of the Persians, was Philip II of Macedon. His son, Alexander, would proceed from Greece, into Persia, and it would fall. Thanks for reading my LLLLLLLOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNGGGGGG rant. I hope you enjoyed it.

At first they just conquered more than half of it except Athens and Sparta, but then with help of Spartans to Persians they conquered Athens and burnt it down. Spartans were indeed good warriors, but thats not how it was as you see in those \u2018\u2019Hollywood Movies\u2019\u2019 lol, first of all Persians didn\u2019t have like \u2018\u2019million\u2019\u2019 of warriors, maybe yeah they had many soldiers but not a million. Its just Greek historians during that time exeggerating numbers to show their people that \u2018\u2019thats how we defeated them\u2019\u2019. In almost every battle Greeks had against their invaders you will see like, small amount of Greeks fighting against huge armies lol but thats not true, their historians always liked to exeggerate that much since Ancient Greek history itself is based on \u2018\u2019legends&mythologies\u2019\u2019 they did the same about Battle of Troja. They said Trojans had like 30.000 soldiers against our 2.000 Myceneans.. however it wasn\u2019t that possible for a city state \u2018\u2019Troja\u2019\u2019 to have 30.000 soldiers against all of Greek cities lmao.

            "answer_text": "No This is one question of history that has always made me wonder everytime How is this possible? We can say it sheer luck but luck doesn\u2019t work everytime, there is something more in Greeks that succumbed them to be undefiable A bit of history..Greeks are the original inventors of Western Philosophy. They had produced the branches of logic and reasoning, tge beginning point of modern Science Socrates, his pupil Plato, his pupil Aristotle and his pupil Alexandra the Great all were just brilliant. Democracy was invented there, it is said that number of inventions done during Greek Empire in 150 years were more than the inventions after 1000 years combined (You could learn Greek philosophy from book Sophie\u2019s World).And yet it was spread as city-states, Spartans and Ionians were popular amongst them. Persian civilisation rose a great deal from Mesopotamian Civilisation alongst Eupharates and Tigris river basins. And they stretch their empires from far West Africa to boundaries of India, a great deal was occupied under their ruler Cyrus the Great except for Greece. They attacked with sheer army but failed, thanks to Greeks. After Cyrus\u2019s death, Darius attacked Greece with even more force and better tactics and again failed miserably to occupy Greece (Remember \u2018300\u2032 movie?) and it was humiliating for such a large army to surrender,Darius tried but couldn\u2019t manage to win After Darius came Xerxes son of \u2018Darius the great' asif killing Greeks was his only objective and tried even harder. The odds were always with him but guess what? Even Darius failed! After that Persians left Greeks forever as if they were unconquerable. And even to this day, people dont know how Greeks managed to do this, but they were never defeated in any of Greco-Persian Wars Greeks were simply awesome ",

But in a war, in order to conquer you have to win. The Persians failed to achieve any major victories against the combined Greek forces (\u2018combined\u2019 is a strong word - the Persians performing a sound advancement-consolidation tactic, backed by highly effective diplomacy, never faced more than a third of the armed forces the Greeks could gather; less, actually). The size of the mobilized force was also too high, by necessity, to supply, in order to allow them to win a war of attrition. When they suffered defeat at Salamis and Plataea, they retreated almost all the way back to Asia (only a small part of the land forces managed to return). The only time Persians achieved a major victory was against the Athenians, in Egypt, during a major local uprising Athens had been asked to support - but they were at the defensive, never to dare an attack against mainland Greece again.

            "answer_text": "The Persian Wars took place between Greece and Persia in the 5th century BCE. Persia invaded Greece in 490, leading to the Persians' defeat at Marathon, and in 480 BCE. One reason that the Greeks defeated the Persians when the Persians invaded in 480 is that the Persian army under Xerxes took so long to transport their armies to Greece that the Greeks had ample time to prepare a defense. In addition, Greece had the advantage because it was defending its own territory, and it was difficult for the Persians to transport all their troops and ships to Greece. The Greek army included hoplites, who were citizen-soldiers armed with spears and shields. In battle, they formed phalanxes. The hoplites had spears and armor that were superior to those used by the Persians, which gave them an advantage in hand-to-hand combat. During the Persian invasion of 480, the Greek city-states coordinated their defense, with Sparta controlling the army and Athens controlling the navy. As Xerxes's forces approached Greece, the weather inflicted damage on them. When the Persians engaged with the Greeks in August of 480, a storm destroyed the Persian fleet while the Greek fleet, safe in the harbor, remained intact. The Persians defeated the Greeks at Thermopylae in central Greece, but they suffered heavy losses. The Greeks also used surprise maneuvers to defeat the Persians. They pretended to retreat but lured the Persian ships into the straits of Salamis, where they the Persians were defeated. Eventually, after the battles of Plataea and Mycale, the Persians went home. The wars between the Greeks and Persians continued for 30 more years, until the Peace of Callias in 449 BCE. ",
