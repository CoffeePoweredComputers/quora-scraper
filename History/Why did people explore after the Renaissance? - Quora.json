            "answer_text": "After the tumultuous, horrible times of the Middle Ages, it was time for society to be reborn. The age of \"rebirth\" in European society occurred between the 14th and 17th centuries, at a time called the Renaissance. Within this time period, a massive growth in intellect, human potential, and art ensued, and society, overall, changed for the better. Almost simultaneously, a huge social and political change erupted in northern Europe, specifically the Holy Roman Empire, with the Protestant Reformation initiated by Martin Luther. Peasants revolted, the Catholic Church was questioned, and eventually, the power of the Holy Roman Empire was greatly weakened. Finally, with the growth of intellect and an interest in furthering human potential came the Age of Exploration, in which countries like Portugal, Spain, France, and England attempted to expand their countries through colonization of the New World. The social, political, and economic foundations of European society were greatly changing, slowly paving the way for the Modern Era. ",
