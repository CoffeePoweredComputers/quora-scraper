But the truth of delhi university is \u2026 I did bsc(h) electonics from DU and still persuing msc electronics . This questions is mainly depend on ..what is your course ???? If u select a some precious courses which provide u placement if u want then it would be your luck because most of the courses doesn't provide you a satisfied placement\u2026.2. Moreover for study purpose it is just \u201cgovernment sansthan\" but i Don't think that teacher are not experienced they are more extraordinary and having much experience which clear your any doubt in related subjects but main think that they are always partial. Having limited work i.e. students means only for study. 3. If u have a internal source and family member (having high post) than ofcourse u have bright future. All point are 100% truth and observed(eyewitness) The name of DU potential your capabilities . Your ego and confession makes your confidence. And only skill makes your competitive future!! So DU is precious platform of competition which spark your transient goals. At last DU student itself find his way either doing higher study or shift to another platform(cgl,ias,gate,ssc,etc) and make his own future. Thanks- ashish ",

            "answer_text": "In today's context university or no university hardly makes any difference. If you've the knowledge & capabilities you're good to step out and conquer the world. If not even being a graduate from oxford wouldn't help you much. Stratification on various grounds, it's all in the head really. If you're delivered quality education even in some remotest corner of the country and you know it's application, you'll be far above a delhi university graduate studying in the national capital. Again, I'm not in anyway maligning the image of DU, just telling you making comparisons is baseless. The real world is after university, which indeed is a great equaliser. Hope this helps! ",
