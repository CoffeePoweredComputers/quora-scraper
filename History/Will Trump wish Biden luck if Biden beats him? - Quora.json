            "answer_text": "It could easily be a month after the election before the dust settles and the winner is known. If it\u2019s not Trump, he may not accept the results easily. But they\u2019ll be another 6 to 8 weeks between that time and the actual inauguration. By then he will have had some time to accept that\u2019s he\u2019s going to have to leave office. Whether you like Trump or not, you have to acknowledge that he\u2019s dealt with a lot of hate over the last few years. Once he thinks about it, he might be quite OK turning over the reins of country that\u2019s still dealing with the worst pandemic in 100 years, torn by racial unrest, and in a serious economic downturn. Suddenly that will all be somebody else's problem to deal with. Outgoing presidents tend to act with grace towards the incoming presidents. Partly out of tradition, partly out of respect for our democratic processes, and just maybe, partly because they are done with what has to be one of the most difficult jobs in the world. They will get a pension of around $219,000 per year. They don\u2019t have to lift a finger. But people will want them to speak, - to write a book, - all potentially very lucrative. Trump likes speaking in front of large crowds. He can continue to let his kids deal with the day to day operations of his businesses. He can do as much or as little as he likes and still make money. He can golf every single day if he wants. He can go on Fox News and critique everything that the new administration does. Did you see what Obama did after he left office? He partied in the Virgin Islands with billionaire Richard Branson. He practically disappeared for months.  Does that man not look like he\u2019s had the weight of the world lifted off his shoulders? Well, he has. Of course Trump will be unhappy about not having more time to turn the economy around, to see the country to the end of the pandemic, etc. But whether it\u2019s now or in another 4 years, there will always be unfinished business, more that you wish you could have done. There will always be those who are critical of your time in office. He did get a new NAFTA agreement that most everyone agrees is an improvement, the economy was good for most of his term. He didn\u2019t get the country involved in any major armed conflicts (at least not with other countries). He\u2019ll have gotten 3 conservative judges on the Supreme Court. I\u2019m sure he can come up with huge list of accomplishments, - real or imagined. Why not wish Biden good luck? He\u2019s going to need it and no one knows that better than Trump. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not in the character of Donald Trump to wish any opponent success or good will. Remember his awful Inauguration speech in which he rebuked and appalled the then current GOP leaders, as well as pretty much everyone else even after he won. America will be fortunate if Trump does not make his usual stink and outrageous claims in his usual fashion. Biden will certainly need a lot of luck handling what he inherits. I hope I am wrong about Trump\u2019s reactions. Some rumors have it Trump never really wanted or expected to be President, and for awhile on election night in 2016 it looked like he wouldn\u2019t, and at that moment he seemed to accept it. Then tallies from Penn, Mich, Wisc came in and it all changed. ",
