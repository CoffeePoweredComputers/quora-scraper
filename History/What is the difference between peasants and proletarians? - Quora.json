            "answer_text": "The two do often live under different conditions. A peasant is often bond to his master and owns perhaps a little bit of land, from loans that the land master provided. If you are familiar with Malcolm X, he refers to slaves as two kind of personalities, one work on the field and hates his master while the other lives in the house with his master and love him. Quote: If the owner's house caught fire, the field Negro prayed for wind. If the owner got sick, the field Negro prayed for him to die. If somebody suggested to the field Negro that he escape, he would leave in an instant. Malcolm X said that there are still house Negroes and field Negroes. Message to the Grass Roots - Wikipedia If we look at Vietnam there was a sharp class struggle between masters and slaves - the communists gave the peasants land and opportunities different from what they were living under. In similarities, peasants took weapons under the direction of the communist party. But they can not be viewed as a revolutionary class. Proletarians on the other side work hourly and rent his workforce as wage labor. He knows how to operate the machines and work hard. He sells his body for a price but is free to buy his commodities. The modern proletarian has gone to school and are educated but still live under capitalist conditions. Quote: Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of laborers crowded into the factory, are organized like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army, they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is. Manifesto of the Communist Party I hope this may help you out in your search for answers. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, while Marx considered those workers who were employees and did manual labor, to be proletarians, he excluded from the definition of proletarian, the farm workers. So he looked down on the farm workers as not being proletarians, as being less capable of the class struggle than the proletarians, he believed that the future revolution against capitalism would be organized by the proletarians, who would then establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, and the farm workers would have no role in the revolution. That is why he believed the revolutions would first happen in countries with lots of factory workers, like Germany and Britain, and not in a country where most were still peasants, as was true then of Russia and China. So then no wonder that in the last free election in Russia before free elections were banned, the majority of the Russian people voted for Socialist Revolutionary Party, which was a socialist non-Marxist party in Russia, supported mainly by the peasant majority in Russia, while the Marxist parties got much fewer votes. And so then the first time the newly elected parliament met, the communists, who had taken power in a coup. sent soldiers to disperse the new parliament, and it was not allowed to meet again. And after several years, the Socialist Revolutionary Party was totally banned, as were all the other parties, except the Communists. Millions of the peasants were killed during the Russian civil war, which was started soon after the communist coup. There were peasant uprisings against the Red Army, as well as against the White armies, all suppressed terribly by the armies, with millions of the peasants killed. So many millions of Russians were killed during the civil war. So horrible. And the civil war was caused by the communist coup of 1917, which ended the Russian attempt to have democracy. And of course the communists followed Marxist ideology, so then much of their supporters was among factory workers, very little support for them among the peasants. ",
