            "answer_text": "The government intervenes in the economy in many ways. I assume you are asking about top-down decisions explicitly designed for their economic effects\u2014monetary and fiscal policy, bailouts, antitrust suits, banking regulation, mortgage guarantees, subsidized loans and deposit insurance\u2014rather than things like bankruptcy law, fraud prosecutions, truth-in-labeling laws, occupational licensing and so on. By \u201ccontrol\u201d I assume you mean high-level things like fighting recessions and inflation, redistributing wealth, changing the balance of international trade and directing the economy in socially useful directions, rather than things like supporting farm prices or minimum wage laws. Although many people believe economies can work just fine without any collective action\u2014just through the laws of supply and demand, supplemented with court actions for fraud, bankruptcy and other disputes\u2014collective action does seem to make things more efficient. Standardization of weights and measures, agreement on a currency, standardized contracts, collective bargaining and many other procedures are useful. My opinion is you would find all these things\u2014and more\u2014even in an entirely libertarian society. The only difference is when the government tries to do these things, it makes decisions through a political process and enforces them by violence. Non-governmental collective action is organized by individual choice, and is imposed on no one. People who resisted the broad consensus might find other people refusing to do business with them, but they would not be jailed or have their property seized. So my answer is that if governments got out of the top-down economic control business, it would be taken over by voluntary groups. There would likely be a lot less intervention, but in my opinion, what there was would be more effective and fair. ",

            "answer_text": "How would an economy be controlled without government intervention? You need to qualify what do you mean by government intervention? Since you haven't let me see how government intervenes with economy? Monetary PolicyGovt SpendingMonetary Policy is the practice of manipulating with the money supply in the country. You can stop doing it at the cost of volatility and the risk of falling into a run away recession. So say economists who follow Keynes. Govt Spending is a way to control economy in a country since it is a component of the GDP. You can not object to it if the Govt wants to spend on something that helps its citizen. The point is how does it pay for it? Does it tax it's citizen below subsistence levels to get the money? Then it is bad. Does it get the money as a debt from its citizens? Nothing wrong except that it would deprive the money being used as capital for more businesses to push the economy. So I guess within limits it is acceptable. Or Does it get the money as a loan from the future that may get it's tenure extended forever? That is bad, it makes things easy for the government but hits the citizens with price rises. Now to answer the question, can economy be controlled without government indulging in monetary policy or govt spending i don't see any harm. Economy can survive without the two functions above. You do not need a government to enforce the concept of money. Money or promissory notes were conceptualised , created and maintained without the intervention of a government. It was when the rulers or government found it convenient to take control of the monetary system that it we see a government and a federal bank to maintain the concept of money. The government need not take the burden of building infrastructure in the country. Many countries do not bother to even fund such projects. If such a project is financially viable, then some entrepreneur will attempt to exploit the opportunity. Having said that, you still need a government to ensure law and order in the country and a system to administer justice. You should be able to get a fair value for your goods or services. You do not want government or any body else meddling with that do you. But if someone walks away without paying up for goods or services sold, then you should have the means to recover your dues. Don't tell me to employ a private army to provide security fir my business. And to finally answer the part of the question which asks \u201cHow\u201d, i would say that economy will look after itself if you ensure free markets. You do not need a government to hold it's hands. But , you want the economy to be controlled. Well, we already have guilds and business bodies \u201ccontrolling\u201d business and commerce. It is kind of a democratic governing body among like limited businessmen. You can trust these people. Other than that there is no self aware , self correcting algorithm that can be implemented to \u201ccontrol\u201d the economy. ",
