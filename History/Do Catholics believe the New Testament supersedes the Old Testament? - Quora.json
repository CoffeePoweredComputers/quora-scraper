            "answer_text": "The New Testament, for Catholics, both supersedes and fulfills the Old Testament. We believe the whole Bible is a unity: God's love story with us, his wooing us to return. As such, properly understood, there is no contradiction. One difference: the Old Testament does express what God wanted to say--but it is also expressed through the personality, culture and literary expressions of the authors. As they were limited beings, with limited understandings of God, so their writing are, at times, groping for how to understand and speak about God. We see it, for example, in the shifting attitudes towards monotheism: at first, God is God of Israel, but the other nations have their own Gods (Chemosh, Baal, etc.), albeit lesser in power of course. Monotheism is expressed by the idea that Israel should only worship their own God. Later, by the time of the Book of Isaiah, these other gods are clearly not true Gods, but powerless idols.  The New Testament, however, has at its heart Jesus, God-become-human. This means that Jesus has an unparalleled knowledge of God, and is able to teach us about God in the ways that are clearer and more precise than the prophets and writers of Israel and Judah. Now we not only have one God (in three persons), but can go beyond that to God as Love--not just one God, but ever uniting and flowering out in new life. In all of these cases, there will be differences of detail. Indeed, we would be surprised if there were not--different witnesses in a court case will have different descriptions of what they experienced, but we do not thereby call them liars or mistaken--they just saw and interpreted it or remembered it slightly differently. Likewise, different painters will paint slightly different portraits of a subject, from different perspectives and with different techniques. But while the multiple accounts do make it more difficult to figure out \"what happened,\" they may end by giving us a better appreciation for what the authors considered to be most important. This seeing the Old and New Testaments with one eye is helped by the Catholic understanding of Scripture as being both literal and symbolic--after all, a symbol by definition has multiple referents.

You cannot supercede something when it provides your entire foundation! This is why the bishops decided to keep the Old Testament when they set the Bible Canon. You know, if they had wanted to, they could have omitted some or all of the Old Testament. They decided to keep the whole thing. Or do you think you have a better grasp of what's going on so you know better than them? The Old Testament is superior in many ways. For instance, it was edited for a much longer period of time, thus, the quality of the writing is tops. It has much more material than the New Testament, and it doesn't go over the same details over and over again. It has some simply marvelous stories! ",

            "answer_text": "There is incredible consistency between the Old and New. One obvious reason is that the technique used to convince of Jesus was through reference (direct or indirect) to the Old Testament. I remember a fun fact on Revelation, that it had something like 412 indirect references to the Old Testament. I have forgotten the number but I know it is greater than the number of verses. The problem that many have today is that they read the Bible out of cultural context and assume the Jewish belief to be opposite what Jesus brought. The problem is Jesus was a Law-practicing rabbi. He spoke to Jews and they thought Him brilliant. The concepts are the same from Old to New. Catholics understand this better than most because of the continuation of tradition. The first thought is to reach back to the first century Jew and the Early Church Fathers and lean on their perspective. Even the Bible used is the Septuagint with all its books - the same that Jesus and Paul referenced, not the Protestant Bible that had books removed only 500 years ago. if read in context, the contradictions you think you see go away.

Catholics also believe that The books which are known as Deuterocanonical books originally belong to the Old Testament. Martin Luther took these books off his Bible so these books are missing from the Old Testament of most Bibles today. This may explain contradictory statements. In short: Catholics don't believe that there is contradiction between the Old and the New Testaments but their Old Testament is probably different than the one you have in your Bible. ",

The OT was generally thought of as history with a lot of allegory and myth....Again, the Catholics never were into \"literacy\". The New Testament, dealing directly with the story of Jesus, was much more to the point. However, (again as to my childhood instruction) there was very little emphasis on the Gospels as history but rather as a more-or-less coherent telling of the story.  I don't ever recall anyone discussing the obvious (and often irreconcilable) differences between the Gospels. Of much more importance was Catholic theology and church doctrine, essentially all of which was developed long after the events surrounding Jesus' life.   (if ever there was one....) ",
