            "answer_text": "The same reason Non-bengalis during Dewali offer alcohol and chat ! See, We are bengalis. We have our own culture , our own language. India is amalgamation of different cultures. But it seems like, some people from the cow belt think , that they are the 'true' Indians , their language is the 'true' language only. They are forcing their language , food habits , culture on others ! They think as they eat vegetarian diets, rest of India must have vegetarian diets as well. No , sir, that will not happen ! A bunch of urdu speaking idiots from the same region imposed their language on bengali muslims, which resulted in creation of Bangladesh. Now, some idiots are doing the same in India. They are imposing their language, culture on Tamils, Bengalis, Kannadigas ! This is not right ! The moment you force us to follow your culture or tradition you are creating a problem ! Now, let's come to the mutton biriyani thing ! If you understand sarcasm, it would be clear from the first sentence itself. We don't serve mutton biriyani in Pandals. Bhogs are pure vegetarian diets. However we do celebrate durga puja with non-veg diets, but that are mostly in restaurants, hotels, bars, street food stalls ! No restrictions during Navratri, it is feast! Celebration time. But while we offer Anjali, we bath, we fast, and offer our anjali to Maa durga. Once anjali is over, we usually hang out with our friends and family, hop Pandals, eat biriyani or fish or whatever at restaurants or street food stalls and keep hoping Pandals. Pandal hoping is something like appreciating the creative work, illumination, art! ",

            "answer_text": "Well dude in my whole life I never saw somebody offering biriyani to the Goddess, especially in a pandal which have been an communal celebrations. However is it technically wrong to offer non-veg food to Durga? Bengal has been primarily a land of rivers and lakes and fishes were ample and formed a cornerstone of the diet. Except for a few staunch baishnabs and few unfortunate upper caste widows everyone ate fish. Fish is the primary indicator of prosperity and is widely served to guests. Bengal has the tradition of worshipping clay images of the Goddess, such Durga, Kali and Annapurna, who were treated as esteemed guests during the course of the worship, and thus feed an choicest of delicacies during the ritual. Durga is additionally seen as the daughter of a family and it is unthinkable in Bengali householfs to welcome a daughter without fish. Thus fish became a integral part in Durga Puja. Fish is offered to the Goddess in many esteemed family as well in Ramkrishna Math. Now is meat offered? It is. However unlike fish it is less frequently offered. It is only as procuring ritual meat is very cumbersome. It needs to be only mutton, with the animal being killed before any icon of the Goddess with a single blow. It is however cooked without onion and garlic and then presented to the Goddess.( It tastes heavenly). This offering of Biriyani is not technically wrong provided it is cooked without onion and garlic ( which is not technically possible). However some families in Durga Puja donot offer fish due to baishnab influence but rather offer other delicacies to the Goddess as various milk sweets. The communal pujas also follow this rule. However if you don't offer non-veg food then you cannot allow it near the worship area. So you won't find any plate of Biriyani in a pandal.. ",
