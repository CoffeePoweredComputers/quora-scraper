            "answer_text": "Wine is extremely sensitive to oxidation. This means that once you uncork the bottle and oxygen is free to flow in, the highly reactive O2 molecules in the air will be free to wreak havoc on the aromatic compounds which give the wine its distinctive taste. The chemical products resulting from the oxidation are often acids and aldehydes, which impart a less than desirable aroma. While oxygen is one of the most chemically aggressive elements, argon is completely unreactive under normal conditions. It is also twice as heavy as oxygen. Therefore, argon (and often nitrogen) gas is pumped into the bottle to displace the oxygen. That way, the sensitive aromatic compounds are preserved. ",

            "answer_text": "Argon is an inert gas that is used to shield the exposed surface of wine to oxygen and thus prevent oxidation or acetic acid production. It in itself doesn't perform any anti-oxidative function other than being heavier (25% more dense) than the air it's protecting the wine from. Typically it's used to shield the topmost surface in tanks, kegs, and barrels. Usually Nitrogen is used as the primary inert gas for bottling procedures like inert gas sparging and oxygen displacement. ",
