            "answer_text": "I have a story that I can't explain. About a year ago, a friend of mine, let's call him Martin for the sake of privacy, was in an accident with a tow truck driver on the intersection of I-380 and I-80. The tow truck driver was killed and Martin was facing vehicular homicide charges and was requested to appear in court. Martin, a week after the accident, killed himself. I like to believe, although I don't have ANY SOLID proof, that he did it out of guilt of killing a father of 2 children.(keep in mind, he didn't tell a sole about the accident and everyone was unaware of the situation until after his death.) Before we start, let me tell you a little about Martin. Martin was my best friend, he always seemed to have everything together. He lived with his girlfriend in his own apartment at the age of 19. He paid the entire rent bill and both his and his girlfriend's phone bills. His girlfriend had a low income job and could only cover groceries. He told me he had visions of marrying her and wanted me to be in the wedding party. I had 100% certainty that he was going to live the rest of his life with her. I spent numerous nights passed out drunk on their couch and much more days laughing and enjoying life with them. When Martin went missing he left a deep and dark message to his mother and girlfriend saying how he can't live with himself any more and that he is gravely sorry for everything he had done. His family and our friends went on a manhunt. I drove up in down every county road and had my fingers crossed and a rosary in my hand hoping to find the bastard passed out drunk in the driver seat on some back road. We didn't find that. We found his car, with him inside, his face was unrecognizable. He had shot himself. This image is forever burned into my mind. His smile is foreign to me. I can only picture his face when I see a picture of him. Whenever I think of him now I can only picture his lifeless corpse. His death tore my life to pieces, I was severely depressed and had attempted suicide twice. About 4 months ago(early December 2015), I had a dream that haunts me to this day. The dream was the first dream I had where Martin was in it since his death. But he still had his hole in his face. The blood and brain fragments still littering his rosey cheeks. We were sitting in the Old Shop Room at our old high school where we spent a lot of our time together and where we became best friends. We were laughing, it felt emotionless but we were laughing and joking. I woke up from my dream for a second and drank some water at my bedside then I nodded back off. But the dream continued. This time we were on top of a 15-20 story building in our city. He pointed to where he had killed the tow truck driver. He said in the coldest, most intense voice I'd ever heard, \"You will soon feel my pain, the pain of suffering both physically and mentally. You may live, you may die. \" I don't recall much of the dream after that. I woke up the next morning and went on with my Friday. The night after, I was heading home from a long night in the office(1:00A.M.) I was doing my normal commute back home passing over the location where Martin had pointed to in the dream. I remembered what Martin had said to me in the dream the night before. \"You will soon feel my pain, the pain of suffering both physically and mentally.You may live, you may die.\" I got the chills for a second and began to slow down to a slower speed because of how hard this scene hit me. As I continued onward, a cement wall limiting the view of the upcoming roadway(for safety against oncoming traffic), was about to end.. A split second after I clear the dividing wall. I saw a figure, a man in his early 20's. Standing in the 3rd lane of the southbound traffic. I was driving in the third lane. As I approached him, I began to slam on my breaks. I swiftly adjusted my direction to the left shoulder of the interstate to avoid him but the man glided across the ground without moving his feet. It was as if he were a puck in an air hockey game. I was scared, I couldn't comprehend what was happening. I veer back to the center of my lane. Bracing myself for an impact. My car came to a an abrupt stop. It took about a minute after the stop to realize that I hadn't hit anything, something had hit me. An oncoming driver in the northbound traffic had crossed the median. I thought to myself how lucky I was to be alive and that it was divine how I hadn't been turned into a wad of metal and blood. But then I realized that someone else may be in trouble. I had to check on the other driver. I dashed across the highway and came to a mess of a situation. I immediately saw a car in 100's pieces. Everything was destroyed except for the frame and a third of his engine bay. I noticed the driver, A man in his early 20's, halfway outside his windshield. He was flailing like an animal after it had been run over. I was apparently in a 9-1-1 call at this point. I remember the lady shouting \"DON'T MOVE HIM! DON'T MOVE HIM! HELP IS ON THE WAY!\". So I just sat there watching this man struggle and gasp for air. No words were leaving his mouth. Nothing but gasps being drowned in blood could be heard from the wreck. We made eye contact, I was trying to be soothing and was telling him to hold on and attempted at comforting him. But I felt a lack of presence in this man. As if he were spacing off in a classroom. As if he were on a different planet. I looked into his eyes again, he looked at me. He opened his mouth and breathed the words, \"Martin still cares.\" I was in total shock. Did he say what I think he just said? How did he know Martin and more importantly, how did he know my affiliation with him? I came back to reality and the situation to see the man smiling at me. He let out one last \"Hah\" as his eyes went empty. He had passed. After that everything was a blur. I was overwhelmed with the pain of watching a man die. I couldn't make sense of his last words. I didn't even include that in the police report. All I could think about was how this man looked into my eyes and I was the last thing he saw. I watched as a man slowly bleed out while being impaled by a windshield. I watched the tragedy. It was as if I saw death's finger caress this man's chiseled jawline. I thought to myself, maybe I was Death to him. Maybe I was his guideline into another transient world that isn't the one we sit on now. I wasn't sure what to think at that point. After the police cleanup, eyewitness reports, and being examined my medical professionals. I stumbled into my home around 3:50A.M. Someone dropped me off but I couldn't remember who. Somehow I ended up making a cake and managed to eat it all. Eventually I dosed off to sleep as the sun rose. I woke up the next day, around 8:00 A.M. I walked downstairs to find my parents making a MASSIVE breakfast (a rare occasion in my household). They asked how I slept and I said good considering what happened last night. They looked at me puzzled and asked what happened. I told them about the man floating in the roadway, the accident, everything that happened last night in immense detail with the exception of the dead man's last words. When I was finished, they looked at me and said nothing. We sat in silence for about 15 seconds and then my dad jokingly spoke, \"What kind of drugs do you kids take nowadays?, I need me some of that S***.\" He told me to look outside, I agreed to his request. I opened our front door and there was my white 01' Chevy Lumina. Spotless, with not a scratch on it. I asked my dad what time I had come home and he said at about 4:00 and I made a commotion in the kitchen after. I questioned my reality. One part of me says that the story about last night's accident was true. That I was in an accident and I watched a man die. But seeing my car contradicts everything I believed was true. I put off the whole accident thing and continued to eat breakfast. I assumed maybe it was all a bad dream. It felt so real. I did some further investigating after breakfast and found out there was a deadly crash at that EXACT location and that a man committed suicide by driving his car across a median into a ditch. His name, Hunter.  \"We all have demons we battle. When and where will vary\" -One of the last messages I ever received from my good friend, Martin.   ",

            "answer_text": "That would be the birth of my daughter, and the subsequent couple of weeks afterward Mainly, finding out she had a rare chromosome disorder. My daughter, Kaylee, was born in September 1998 by cesarean section. Up to the moment of her birth, we had no idea that anything was wrong with her. Ultrasounds were normal, and we were thrilled. My own little bundle of joy to cuddle and love. I was ecstatic! Her due date was September 23rd. September 23rd came and went, and still no baby. I went to what I hoped was my last OB appointment on September 30th. We found out that she had turned around and was now in a breach position. She was a small baby, so the doctor said she had plenty of room to move around and was basically turning somersaults in my stomach. She went ahead and sent me to the hospital to finally bring her into the world. They predicted that she would turn around once I was on Pitocin and everything was going to be fine. The drive to the hospital was filled with joyous phone calls and nervous chatter. I couldn't believe the big moment was finally here. I got checked in, put into a room, IV started, and they started the Pitocin. Everything was going smoothly, until the doctor came in for the exam. The good news was that she had turned around head first The bad news was that the umbilical chord was around her neck so it was decided that a cesarean section was the logical answer. At this point, I was nervous and scared for my baby. Laying on the table in the OR and waiting for them to get her out felt like an eternity. I could tell the moment they pulled her out and saw her that something just wasn't right. The air seemed to go out of the room, and I thought I was going to pass out. But they wrapped her up and brought her over for me to see her. To me, she was the most beautiful baby I had ever seen, She was so tiny. Only 6 lb, 1 oz., and 18\" long. I was sent to recovery for what seemed like forever, but was really less than 2 hours. I was moved into a room and waiting anxiously for her. When they finally wheeled her in she was in an incubator, and I wasn't allowed to hold her. Only reach through a hole in the side and touch her. She had petechiae all over her body. They were small purple bruising spots the size of pencil lead. I remember just wanting to be able to hold her, but she was being transported to the University of Kentucky Children's Hospital. That's when the hardest part started. I was stuck in a hospital 30 miles away from where my baby was being taken. I had just had surgery and wasn't allowed to leave the hospital until I had recovered. She needed me, and I needed her. It broke my heart when they wheeled her out and I knew I wouldn't be able to see her for 2 days until I was released from the hospital. Those were the longest 2 days of my life. 1 couldn't wait to get to see my angel again. Finally the time came and we went straight to the Children's Hospital. There was my little precious girl, in an incubator, under a jaundice lamp, with coverings over her eyes and an IV in her head. I couldn't stop the tears from flowing down my face. I was told that they weren't sure what was wrong with her, but had taken blood and had started running test after test. Her heels were bandaged up where they had to take a razor blade and slice them to get blood for the tests. The IV was in her head because they couldn't get it in here small veins in her arms. I vividly remember the first time I got to hold her...getting all the tubes and wires out of the way so I could situate her in my lap to feed her. I would just sit and hold her and stare at her, and fall more in love with her by the minute. Days later, she was finally done with the jaundice lamps and was placed in a regular bed. I would have spent the night there if they would have let me, I would get up in the morning, stay all day, and come home late at night. I hated when I had to leave her at night. We had multiple conversations with neurologists, cardiologists, and geneticists. I had 10 tubes of blood taken to run a barrage of tests to see if it was genetic. Finally after 6 days in the hospital, it had a name. Jacobsen Syndrome or 11q terminal deletion[1] . I had never heard of Jacobsen Syndrome, and neither had almost anybody else at the hospital. We were lucky to get her diagnosis so early. Some people find out years later what their children have. It was a relief just to have a name to put with it. After 10 days in the hospital, they released Kaylee to come home with us. She was eating well, gaining weight slowly, and there was nothing else they could do for her in the hospital. We left the hospital without really knowing what was going to happen. Would I be able to take care of her? Was I capable being a good mom to a child that was \"different\"? I soon realized that I didn't have anything to worry about. She was a fantastic baby! She ate well, slept well, and was adored by everyone in the house. We had regular doctor appointments to check on her progress. When she was around 7 months old, it was recommended that she start physical and occupational therapy. We started going 2 times a week, but I couldn't see that she was making progress. She cried the whole time and so we stopped going. For the most part, Kaylee is very healthy. She has Paris-Trousseau syndrome, which is a bleeding disorder. Approximately 90% of kids with Jacobsen Syndrome have this. It can cause abnormal bleeding and easy bruising. She bruises easily from bumping into things or falling down, but her blood clots well enough that it's not a major concern anymore. She has had strabismus surgery two times. Strabismus is a disorder where the eyes do not line up correctly, resulting in crossed or lazy eye. She had to have the muscles tightened in both of her eyes and although they are not perfect, it has helped tremendously. She has a heart murmur, and goes for an EKG and Echo cardiogram every couple of years to check everything out. Congenital heart disease is present in about half of all diagnosed Jacobsen Syndrome kids. We feel very blessed that so far she has not developed this complication, as it can develop later in life. Kaylee has occupational, physical and speech therapy at school. She officially graduated last year, but gets to continue going to this school until she is 21. To say that she loves school is an understatement. She is constantly signing \"school\" and is ready to go back as soon as she is picked up. She loves her teachers who have been fantastic in setting goals for her and helping her to achieve them. We've had a few rough spots a time or two, but overall her school experience has been wonderful. I feel so blessed to have Kaylee in my life. She has made me a better person without even knowing it or trying to, She is the sweetest, funniest, most loving child a parent could ask for. I never get tired of her giving me \"squeezes\" and wanting to ride on my back to go upstairs to brush her teeth and get ready for bed. She loves her blankie, chocolate milk. I look at her sometimes and tears well up in my eyes just thinking about how far she has came in her 19 years, and I wouldn't change a thing.     ",
