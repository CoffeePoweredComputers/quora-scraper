            "answer_text": "So I would be asking a doctor or foot specialist to have a quick look down there, looking for a little athletes foot or toenail rot that could be there. Before you trot down to the doc however, you might see if a foot bath with some common household salt in reasonable concentration helps. This will at least kill anything that might be lurking for a short time (or permanently if you are lucky). Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Do NOT wear the same pair of shoes day after day. They need time to dry-out (and reduce the bacterial load causing the malodour) before you put them on again. Allowing the shoes to dry out also means that they will last longer. So, if you find a perfect pair of shoes - go out and buy another pair the same! Better still, find another pair with a different style and different pressure points, so that you feet can have \u2018effective rest\u2019 as well. ",
