Massaoit the chief of the Wampanoag saw that the Pilgrims had guns & yet they were about to starve. So he sent Squanto the last surviving member of the Patuxet village to help the Pilgrims how to plant corn. He showed them to plant a few seeds with a fish to fertilize the soil. So the Pilgrims allied with the Wampanoag against the Narrangansetts. ",

Death from immune system failures caused the natives to die by the thousands, coupled with 10s of thousands added to that from wars, famine, and genocide fostered by the European exploiting tribal, cultural, and linguistical differences.
