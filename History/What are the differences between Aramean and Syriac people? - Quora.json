            "answer_text": "Over the millennia there has been an erasure of native identities and superimposition of linguistic and cultural layers upon the indigenous nations of the region. There were originally two identities in the Levant. One was the Aramean nation and the other the Assyrian nation. Both cultures spoke Semitic languages that were very similar: Aramaic and Assyrian/Ashurian. However the Arameans used a very adaptable and easy-to-write script whereas the Assyrians continued to use Assyrian Cuneiform as did other nations of the region such as the Sumerians, Akkadians and Babylonians. Over the course of Greek-Roman domination of the region the term Syrian/Syriac was applied to both nations and their respective Semitic dialects and scripts. Fortunately, there has been a revival of the original identities within the two nations and the younger generations have started to re-adopt their true identity terms.Important to note that the Homeland of the Aramean nation is today's Syria in its western, southern, central and northern regions whereas the Homeland of the Assyrian/Ashurian nation is Syria's eastern, northeastern, southeastern as well as Iraq's northwestern region. Many of the Christian \"Arabs\" in the Middle East are actually not Arab at all but rather are Aramean or Assyrian/Ashurian and many have started to reclaim their true identities as is the case in Israel where ever since 2014 Arameans can register under the term \"Aramean\" instead of the erroneous \"Arab\".
