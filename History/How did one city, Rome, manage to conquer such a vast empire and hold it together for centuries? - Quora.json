            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll throw my hat in. Rome\u2019s semi-mythological roots were militaristic (see the Rape of the Sabines), which helped fuel a culture of citizens who were replaceable. One thing the Romans did well was winning an epic war. Probably lost on a casual student, the ancient Romans lost many a battle. They were quite persistent, and continued on. They had no navy but during their wars against Carthage (a Phoenician city-state with centuries of naval experience) they literally reverse-engineered their ships and took their land-based strategies to the sea. Early Roman sea battles were quite like land battles. At some point in time, many many centuries after their mythological founding date, they held a large-ish territory, but nothing comparatively massive in civilization\u2019s histories.At around the beginning of the first century, they were only as large as a dozen other empires in ancient history, buffered by the Atlantic Ocean, the Sahara desert, and uncivilized peoples to the north - compare this to the near east, central Asia, and China, which already had centuries of comparable empires rise and fall for thousands of years. In this regard, Rome was simply the first major civilization in the far reaches of the world which already had seen similar political empires. And they had far and away less culture, scientific discovery, literature, etc., than other entities like the Chinese, Hindu/Indians, Iranians/Persians, Egyptians, etc. At this point their government was still, in name, a Republic - the Roman Republic. In fact, the period between Republic and Empire was a severe, long drawn-out crisis which lasted at least a century, with multiple civil wars and many civil strifes. During this period, it is only chance that they were not destroyed or at least curtailed to a footnote in history. So, at this point I\u2019m trying to say that after 700 years of their mythological founding of April 21, 753 BC, they were not a \u201cspecial\u201d empire by any means. But it is the two hundred years after where they shine. We only know about this seven hundred years because they later dominated and left a legacy that we know about; there were many other civilizations that probably had more culture and domination during that period that we simply don\u2019t study now because, as the saying goes, history is always written by the winners. During the century-long crisis that I mentioned, they abandoned the very inefficient Republic which was a government of a few hundred very rich people into an efficient Empire where the military was ruled by (usually) a single person. And here is where I can answer your question as it compares to other civilizations. If you look at a world map, from the west coast of Spain to the east coast of China, most of civilization existed in Asia and had already developed and warred for thousands of years. Yes, thousands. At this point, the Great Pyramids of Egypt were two thousand years old. Rome appeared on the edge of the world, in an area where there wasn\u2019t civilization like there was in the middle of China or India or Persia. The vast territories of Europe it gained were backwards forests. By no means do I say that these were massive areas of tribal spearman overrun by gun-wielding armored infantry; what I do mean is that, they were technologically inferior and once conquered they removed major external threats for hundreds of years. The same situation in India at that time would not have provided the equivalent security against the Chinese or Sassanids. It therefore gained the benefit of Pax Romana, the Roman Peace, where there was about two centuries of peace without fear of marauding, due to the fact that it became a comparatively modern state in a vacuum, with its only enemies thousands of miles away. The same state in Persia, India, etc., was surrounded on all sides by comparatively advanced civilizations. Sure, there were ebbs and flows in technology and power, but give it a few decades and your neighbors will catch up. In the Roman Empire, there were no such obstacles except in the east (the Sassanids were their historical arch-enemy throughout the Empire\u2019s history, even though most students think of the Northern Germans / Barbarians as such - not so to the contemporary Roman). It\u2019s hard to put this in perspective, but you may know of ancient cities that were surrounded in walls. Those walls existed to prevent marauding warriors from pillaging concentrations of peoples for their woman and food. Unrivaled at that time in history, thousands of square miles within the Roman Empire contained cities that were free from fear of external war. Just two hundred years ago, cities on the Italian Peninsula within a hundred miles of each other warred upon each other. During the first and second centuries AD, there were no external enemies for thousands of miles. Imagine how many resources it must take to build a massive wall for every five to ten thousand people that live in your civilization. Heck, for every five to ten thousand people in modern time, we just require a few doctors. So with this great boon the Romans did not need to devote costly resources to security. The Romans had been absorbing Greek culture for hundreds of years. There were already Greek cities that brought their advanced civilization to the Roman nobilities\u2019 doorsteps well before Greece was conquered. Every noble Roman would have Greek pedagogues. This infusion of education gave Rome the technological prowess that militarism naturally lacks, providing the civilization the means to both conquer and organize. The Roman civilization essentially had a free \u201cpower up\u201d by the grace of their neighboring forebearers, the Greeks. This educational prowess was essential for the organizational skills required to maintain a large political territory. For the glorious-sounding twelve hundred years that Rome existed, really only two or three centuries was it a global power. There are hundreds of Quora answers and hundreds of books about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, so I\u2019ll not go there. For its few hundred years of greatness, there were many factors that led it there. So, I postulate that: It was rooted in strong militaristic tradition, important for surviving during its fledgling years.After its early history, it absorbed modern civilization from a declining Greece, giving it a major jump. This married militarism and education, giving Romans technological prowess.Geography allowed Rome security from most of its borders. The unpopulated barbaric European north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Saharan desert to the south, allowed Rome to only worry about the east.Appearing late in the ancient civilization scene allowed Rome to dominate once conquering its declining Phoenician and Greek neighbors with no major threat from other less-developed European civilizations.While there are countless instances of gaining vast territories in history, most civilizations lose them quite quickly. Rome adapted by radically changing its government from Republic to Empire, allowing it to maintain its territorial expanse.Feedback welcome! ",

As for the Italians, Mussolini attempted to convince the Italians they were cultural descendants of the ancient Romans. After the destruction of the empire in the West, the Italians became atomized in kingdoms of various sizes until the 19th century, so modern Italy is a relatively recent invention and one whose ties to the empire are really archaeological and not cultural.

And there were several Chinese empires which were comparable. Except most historians are Eurocentric and tend to ignore them. But there were also empires in the Middle East which were just as big. Think the Persians. ",

            "answer_text": "Macedon would probably be the closest comparison to the rise of the Roman city state into an empire. The city of Muscovy also won the battle royal to rule the Russian empire, but this was a bit more complex than the roman situation. The most important development in Roman history in terms of their ability to form an empire was the Latin war, in which the Roman empire finally allowed other Italians the same basic political rights and representation as full Roman citizens (citizens of the city of rome still got a few special perks, but Italian families could now enter roman politics). This not only had the important effect of stabilizing the populist politics which had been causing problems for the city of rome, but also established the doctrine that anyone could become Roman if they were assimilated into the empire properly. This is in part why the empire had so much staying power compared to other city state hegemons throughout history. ",
