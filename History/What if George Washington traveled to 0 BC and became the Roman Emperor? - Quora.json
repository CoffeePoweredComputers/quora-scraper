            "answer_text": "First off how would George Washington pull that off? He didn\u2019t speak or read Latin, and English did NOT exist at that time. The closest was the ancestral language of Angle and Saxon, which were far more similar to German, lacking the Norse and French influences found in English today. Not to mention there\u2019s a considerable cultural gap between Washington and the Roman Empire. George Washington was a Christian with no noble family history and strongly romantic feelings for republican government. The Romans, in contrast, were polytheistic, militaristic, divided by class, and had little patience for republics, given the corruption, factions, and civil war that they endured in the end days of the Republic. So for this foreign barbarian with no Latin blood or noble family history to come in and become Roman Emperor is either a joke or an insult. Lastly, George Washington is not the type of guy to become Emperor; this is the guy who started the tradition of calling the President of the United States \u201cMr President\u201d instead of \u201cYour Excellency\u201d. George Washington wanted to retire after the war and had to be persuaded otherwise as the Confederation began to fall apart, but he didn\u2019t resort to force, coercion, bribery, or other such means. This would be a MAJOR disadvantage against him in Ancient Rome. The ONLY thing going for him would be his military background, but even here George Washington is at a disadvantage. George trained and fought in wars where gunpowder was king and armor was useless. So unless he knew how to make gunpowder, or had vast stores of it with him, his training would be worthless. It would be like asking Julius Caesar to command an army in WWI. Simply put, George Washington was a great fit for America because he grew up in America, and thus he fit into the cultural and social makeup of the country. Put him in a foreign place and time and he\u2019d be at a significant disadvantage. ",

            "answer_text": "The very last thing George Washington wanted was to be king or emperor of anything. He fought a long war for freedom from a monarch, and at the end of that war, when the populace of the nation would have been perfectly happy to him crowned as king, handed back all of his power an authority to the Congress and people who had given it to him. He would have been perfectly happy to live out his days in retirement if the new central government had not proven so weak and in need of a new strong president. After serving as two terms, he again left office, setting a precedent for only serving two terms maximum that wold not be broken for 150 years. Seeing aside the difficulties of time travel and setting up a man who wasn\u2019t of patrician rank by birth as emperor of Rome, Washington simply wouldn\u2019t have done the job. ",
