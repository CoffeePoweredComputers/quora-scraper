            "answer_text": "Majority of important topics have been covered in the answers as well as on Balaji's blog. A few topics that I would like to be covered would include: Geopolitics1. North Eastern Indian states, their development, conflicts and current scenario.2. How India has fared in comparison to other countries that got freed from the yoke of colonial rule (African, S-E Asian countries)3. A brief history of India's relations with major world superpowers especially with USA, Russia and China4. India's relations with its neighbours with special emphasis on Pakistan. This should include an unbiased history of Kashmir and point of view of Kashmiris.  Events1. Indian Space and Nuclear program and its development2. Green Revolution, White Revolution3.  Major Indian sporting achievements.4.  Challenges faced by Indian democracy, secularism and lessons learned (Mizo movement, Emergency in 1975, Khalistan Movement and Godhra Riots)5. Major corruption scandals. Now, it would be quite difficult to name people here but I guess the effects scan be discussed.  People 1. A brief description of Bharat Ratna and Param Vir Chakra awardees.2. Major Indian scientists and technology experts (including those of Indian origin) like Hargobind Khurana, Subramanyan Chandrashekhar, Sam Pitroda, Vinod Dham, Ajay Bhatt, Amar Bose, Devang Mehta, Sabeer Bhatia,  etc.3. Major Indian social reformers/activists : Medha Patkar, Aruna Roy, Vinoba Bhave, Anna Hazare (and other Magsasay award winners)4. Prominent Indian sportsmen, authors, and famous artists.5. Role played by prominent businessmen (Narayan Murthy, JRD Tata, Dhirubhai Ambani, Rahul Bajaj, Karsanbhai Patel etc.)  Art & Entertainment1. Current state of various forms of art (in Music, Literature, Dance etc) in India and steps being undertaken for their development.2. Role played by Indian Cinema in uniting the country (because of people like Satyajit Ray, Amitabh Bachchan, Rajnikanth, MGR, A.R. Rehman etc. )3. Literary developments in Indian Languages over the past 60-70 years. North Indians are woefully unaware of important authors and their works by those from other parts of the country.  Controversial Topics:1. Role played by propaganda (like naming everything after Nehru Gandhi family: (e.g. Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna) and its effects. 2. Secularism in India, major communal riots, 1992 Babri Masjid demolition, and role played by various institutions/people like RSS, SIMI, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale etc. 3. Effects of Caste Based Politics, Reservations, Mandal Commission and Youth For Equality. 4. Uniform Civil Code in India: its importance and implications.  Business and Economy1. Hindu Rate of Growth2. Rise of Indian IT and BPO industry. 3. Impact of various social welfare schemes like MNREGA, Food Security Bill etc.  Future Potential1. Issues of high importance that need to be addressed immediately like settling of Border disputes, reforms required in Economy, disinvenstments 2. How India and its neighbours can benefit by developing free movement of goods across their borders and what measures can be taken to develop tourism and economy. Here we can draw a comparison with Europe where one Schengen Visa is applicable for movement across various countries.  Thanks for A2A. Will keep on updating this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Balaji,Thanks for A2A. I look forward to your book. Following are my suggestions. I feel these topics need to be discussed in order to truly understand our post independence history. I also feel that Nehru, Indira and others in this family had taken lots of decisions based on extremely strong likes and dislikes. Part 0: Foundation You may like to include the following1. Partition and its consequences.2. Refugees, their rehabilitation esp difference between the IDPs from West Pak and East Pak. Neglect of Bengali refugees perhaps the reason could be Nehru's dislike for SC Bose and SP Mukherjee. Neglected Bengalis were left to fend for themselves and followers of the Bose were some of the people who aided and provided help to these unfortunate ones.3. Consequences on modern India of this neglect of Bengali asylum seekers. Rise of CPI, loss of Bengali enterprise etc.4.Integration of Princely states and case of Hyderabad, Junagadh v/s Kashmir. How Nehru would have taken down Hyderabad and Junagadh also to the UN.5. How love for Kashmir forced the foreign policy of Nehru and subsequently damaged India. Most of the countries which are today  developed had the benefit of US benevolence at some or other point of time. Pakistan is one of the rare exceptions.6. Development by centralised planning and economic system adopted. Damaging for the honest.7. Why Nehru had to seek support of leftists.8. Why was he blind to the faults of his friends and China.9. Language policy of GoI. Constituent assembly debates, feeling in non Hindi regions. This leads to the next part. Part 1: State Creation1. Congress's policy on linguistic basis for state creation as decided by Gandhi after his taking over around 1920.2. Formation of AP then Mah, Guj, Karnataka. Having the linguisitic states. Part 2: Economic History1. Abolition of zamindari and land reforms  did Nehru have a personal agenda..2. Planned mixed economy.3. Licence permit raj growth of corruption and adhocism.4. Agriculture growth, green revolution, self sufficiency in food.5. Education, literacy growth. Setting up of institutes for higher education. 5.1 Neglect of primary education. Collapse of education system into the examination systems. Missed opportunities and self inflicted injuries.6. Post 1975 growth of NRIs and remittance economy. Part 3: Controversial Laws1. Uniform civil code lack of for non Hindus. 2. Hindu personal laws and  codes and did Nehru have a personal agenda.3. Is Indian judicial system for, by and of the lawyers. Why was jury trial abolished? 4. Flood of laws without any means to implement and try the offenders.5. Like retrospective taxation in Vodafone case our political class has always resorted to breaking the solemn promises. An example is abolition of privy purses for the princes. You may explore the fact that princes were mostly opposing Indira.6. Bank and Coal mines nationalisation.7. Labour and other anti growth laws. These laws are more draconian than the ones in Western Countries. Even developed economies have not been able to arrest the rapid de-industrialisation that they have faced because of grossly over paid labour. Part 4: Evolution of National Symbols1. Why vande matram was not adopted as national anthem? Part 5: Evolution of Politics1. From Congress dominated, both at centre and states, to multi party rules.2. Rise of regional and caste based parties.3. Rise of Hindutva as a force. Whether someone agrees or not I have included this topic as I feel it is necessary to analyse Hindutva.  In order  to understand how to invoke the spirit of renaissance and resurgence in the country and society. The rediscovery of the nation's true identity needs to be discussed and covered. This movement has been and will be a principal movement for a long time in this country. Hindutva is a necessary condition for the true independence and releasing the creativity of Indians. You may like to examine and give your opinion. We must respect the personal rights to hold different opinions and this includes right of Hindus also to their own opinions.4. Rise of global jihad and its impact on India.5.  Other identity based political outfits including the Muslim extremist parties like MIM. Part 6: Conflicts1. Indo-Pak wars .2. Creation of Bangladesh is it in India's favour.3. Indo-China conflict and its influence on India's neighbourhood.4. Internal conflicts sectarian, inter caste, inter state.5. Linguistic chauvinism Kannada against Tamils, Marathi v/s others, Odiya v/s Marwari etc.6. Labour management conflicts, collapse of militant labour unions with the last textile strike of Dutta Samant.7. Naxalism.8. Movements in Punjab, JK and North East of India Naga, Mizo. I will try to further add to these topics whenever new ideas will strike .with best wishes. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not much of a history buff, so my contribution is going to be severely limited. The one topic I would like to see in this compilation of many other wonderful topics is \"The Emergence of the Confident Indian - the boon and the burden\". In cricketing parallel, we know it was the 1983 World Cup win that transformed how the nation saw our cricketers.  Suddenly they were heroes, and for the first time, we expected them to win!  And sure enough, they did!  It wasn't just a transformation in the cricket team though. Was it optimism that permeated the Indian psyche?  Was it something else?  By the time the .com boom came about, no doubt economic liberalization had started, and opportunities for enterprise were already spurring growth.  But there had come about a change in the mindset that couldn't have been triggered by government measures alone. When and due to what did Indians start seeing ourselves in a 'can do' light? It is also the emergence of this Confident Indian that has led to a great deal of false and unnecessary burdens, like expecting India to become a superpower, an obsession with this word, and an insatiable hunger to 'measure up' to standards like the Olympics, the ridiculous pursuit of entry into the Guinness Book of Records, etc. which really should be no measure of self worth.

I am staying away from repeating any of those.  Some of the topics, sub-topics I would like to see in the book, in no particular order, are 1. Shah Bano case and the impact on Indian secularism.2. Influence of the Mandal commission on Indian society3. Emergence, entrenchment and downfall of caste based politics.4. India's space program5. Influence of Bollywood / soap-operas on culture of India6. Cricket World Cup victory 1983, ripples it has sent out.  7. The curious case of democracy flourishing in India in spite of inherent contradictions.  8. The forgotten seven sisters.9. Demanding social justice - case of the Naxalbari agitation.10. The Bhoodan movement of Vinoba11. Fight against big dams - the NBA example. I have no idea whether you would like to research and write on these. These, however come to mind straightaway when I think of contemporary (post 1947) Indian history.  Hope helpful. All the best. ",

The Annexation of Portugese territories was the first instance of independent India using military strength to conquer or reclaim territories. There wre many surprising aspects of the conquest. India used terrorism and guerilla tactics. Pakistan helped India (by not letting Portugal use it as a landing base for its aircrafts carrying arms and personnel). India was criticised by western powers for hypocrisy: telling everybody to make peace but itself instigating a bloody conquest. American president was quoted as \"The pastor has been caught coming out of the brothel\". The Asian and African nations hailed India as a hero to rise against the imperial powers. All in all, India lost its philosophical position as a saint but declared to the world that it was not weak or afraid anymore. ",

But I would like to read a about what foreign leaders in India's neighbourhood as well as in Europe, the Soviet Union & America thought about Nehru as a leader, his policies both economical and foreign. Also I would like to read about the achievements of India's first Prime Minister. No doubt, he made some mistakes - but we are looking backwords into history- a privilege which the decision makers and leaders do not have. Why I am stressing this point is that there is a lot of Nehru bashing in the social media and a general picture has been created that whatever went wrong in India, whatever is wrong in India is because of Nehru. Perhaps you could tackle that in an objective manner. ",

The origin and emergence of Right to Information Act, starting from erstwhile Freedom of information Act 2002, and maybe before that. Role of NCPRI with Prof. Shekhar Singh and other members work.Mr. Shailesh Gandhi can be contacted. He has, and still is, been the part of this Acts evolution into a stronger one. 2. There has been an exponential increase in public awareness and interest about; Elections, Candidates, and Political Parties in our democracy, in recent times. There's lots of data and information in public domain now. Forefront in this campaign of democracy and advocating transparency, is Association for Democratic Reforms, with Prof. Trilochan Sastry and other eminent members. The social media has also come strongly in getting information and views across.  I have written briefly about them here.
