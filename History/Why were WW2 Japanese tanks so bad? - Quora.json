            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy were WW2 Japanese tanks so bad?\u201d The main reason why they were so \u201cbad\u201d is that they were not developed to keep pace with the competition. At the time they were designed (1930s) the main tanks of the Japanese Army (type 95 Ha-Go and type 97 Chi-Ha) were adequate to the task. Indeed, in many ways they were superior to competing tanks like the German Pzkw I or the Italian tankettes. They had enough armor to ward off most small arms fire and their guns were sufficient to defeat infantry strong points. Most importantly, they were small, light and fast enough to maneuver in the jungle terrain found in that part of the world. This was proven during the early campaigns in China and South East Asia. Japanese tanks performed well against the Chinese and even surprised the British when they were able to penetrate terrain thought to be impassable for tanks. Combat experience did show some flaws however. The riveted armor could be dangerous. If a rivet was hit by a bullet, it could enter the crew compartment and ricochet around. The armor was too thin near the rear which made the engine vulnerable to small arms and from the front, heavy MGs like the 50 cal could easily penetrate the thickest parts of the armor. In addition, it was found that the Russian BT series of tanks were far superior as the Japanese guns lacked penetration. A higher performance 47mm was developed for the Chi-Ha that could penetrate the BT armor, but that was about it. Over the years, while the Russians discarded their BTs for T-34s, the British brought in Matildas and the Americans developed the M3 and the M4 tanks, the Japanese essentially did nothing. The Japanese navy got all the resources for shipbuilding and new technology. After them was the Air Force and the Army got what was left. So when Japanese tanks had to engage Matildas, they were completely outclassed. It was even worse against Shermans. In the largest tank battle in the Pacific (Battle of Saipan, June 1944), 2 regiments of Japanese tanks were defeated by a platoon of M4s supported by AT guns. So while the Japanese tanks were sufficient or even superior at the start of the war, they did not keep pace with developing times and were later outclassed and that is what we remember, not their early successes.

            "answer_text": "DISCLAIMER: I am by no means an expert on tanks or WW2. If there is any holes in the arguments I have presented, feel free to point them out in the comments. With that out of the way, here is my answer to this question. Japanese tanks weren\u2019t as awful as one may think. The most likely culprit to this thinking was the Type 95  When the Type 95 met the various M1 Shermans, it\u2019s easy to point and laugh at how awful they were. The Type 95\u2019s puny 37mm gun was unable to penetrate the (compared to some other countries) middling armor of the Sherman, while the Sherman made light work of the Type 95  However the Type 95 proved the line of thinking of \u201cis this tank better then this tank\u201d wrong. In terms of raw combat stats and performance, the M1 Sherman was superior. Better armed and armoured then the Type 95. But if the tanks between the 2 countries were switched, the M1 Sherman would be utterly inferior for Japanese purposes. Before I get into why, let\u2019s look at the kinds of tanks the Sherman could come up against  (Panzer IV G)   (Tiger I and Tiger II)  (Panther D) The Germans had some pretty big and powerful tanks, especially considering how fast tank technology moved in WW2, the Americans needed to have something that at the very least, can deal with German tank if one is encountered, but light enough to be able to transport overseas, however, let\u2019s see what the Japanese could have potentially dealt with:  (Bob Semple, this heap of corrugated iron is as useless against a Type 95 as a Type 95 is against a Sherman. While they never directly met, this is just an example of what the Japanese could have encountered) and maybe the odd one of these (before Japan and Germany were friendly with eachother, Germany and China were and gave China some military gear)  (Panzer I) So let\u2019s say that Japan and the USA switch their tank forces, America now has all their Shermans replaced by Type 95s and Japanese M1 Shermans, assuming crew training and everything is taken into account. For Japan, here would be the following problems: Required more resources to produce (especially important considering the very reason Japan gone to war with all of these countries in the first place)Was heavier and harder to transport overseasCould not get into as tough terrain as the Type 95 could haveLess mobile then the Type 95 (11-13hp/t depending on variant vs 14hp/t, assuming short tons are used)Not as fuel efficient as the Type 95Harder to reload the main gunAnd keep in mind, who the Americans were fighting against. Their tanks had more firepower and armour, for sure, but would that have been necessary to have a hope at fighting the larger German tanks. Compared to the Japanese, who were fighting enemies with little to no motorized forces in their armies. What they did have were often hand-me-downs or indigenous tanks using anything the country had to cobble up something that looked and worked remotely like a tank. The fact that Japan had a large force of tanks in the first place gave them a huge advantage over their enemies. The Sherman (or a tank like it) would be overall worse for Japan then just using the Type 95. The Type 95 was the best tank for Japan, just like the Sherman being the best tank for the USA. The Sherman had very few, if any benefits over using the Type 95 (again, armour protection and firepower were better on the Sherman, but would have barely made any impact in Japan\u2019s theatre of war) The Japanese did have the capability of building heavier tanks as they had a blueprint of a tank based on the Tiger I. But again, a tank like a Tiger I would be inferior compared to the Type 95 considering Japan\u2019s situation. Even if you compare the Type 95 against other tanks of the time, it is clear that the Type 95 wasn\u2019t that bad of a tank. It was like the other tanks available at the time  (another picture of a Panzer I, which had an even inferior armament, carrying just machine guns)  (Panzer II, Germany)  (M2 Light Tank, USA)  (T-26, USSR)  (BT-2, BT-5, BT-7, USSR) The tanks aren\u2019t really much better or worse then the Type-95. The Type-95 was your ordinary early-30s light tank. In conclusion, there was no need for a replacement for the Type 95, as it did it\u2019s job, and did it quite well. It wasn\u2019t a bad tank, especially considering the tanks available in the early 30s, and even one of the newer, more powerful tanks such as a Tiger or M4 Sherman would have been inferior for the situation that the Japanese found themselves in.
