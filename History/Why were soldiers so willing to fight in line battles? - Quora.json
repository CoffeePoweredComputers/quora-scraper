            "answer_text": "While it seems odd to us today, battles were fought in line during the musket and early rifle eras because that was by far the most versatile and powerful means of fighting under the limitations imposed by the weapons of the time. Independent action by infantrymen is possible because it takes advantage of the accuracy of the rifle. Long range fire with the rifles of that era, however, was only useful in small numbers. This was because rifles were horribly slow to reload, making the riflemen extremely vulnerable. Worse, if fired by large numbers of men the rifles would quickly lose their accuracy due to the volume of smoke making aiming at individual men impossible. As a result, they were used primarily by spaced-out skirmishers hiding behind cover (of which more later). For real punch, you needed to use the much faster muskets and overcome their poor accuracy by closing in tight with the enemy. To fight effectively with the musket, you used the line formation. The line formation was a dense enough mass of men to be able to deliver or repel a bayonet charge, could open ranks to lessen the danger of artillery fire, and could form quickly into a square to defend against cavalry. It also was easily maneuverable while maintaining cohesion and control: a line could rotate quickly to deliver or respond to enfilading fire, and a line could form into a column to move quickly about the battlefield. Lines could also deliver all of their firepower at the enemy at the same time, and even provide covering fire for themselves while reloading by firing by ranks. It also allowed for direct command by the officers in a pre-radio era in a way that men fighting individually could not match. Even in a mass, most musket fire was still so inaccurate that heavy casualties from volleys was fairly rare. It took a very disciplined unit to not fire too early and to aim at the proper height while firing into dense smoke. The usual tactic used by the British, for example, was to get in close, deliver only a single volley, then quickly charge the panicking enemy with your bayonets. Battles of the time actually did use irregular formations of men who acted like modern soldiers by hiding behind cover, moving, etc. - they were called skirmishers, and the French in particular were excellent at it. They were used to disrupt and harass the enemy, causing confusion and disorder that would demoralize and break up their formations, leaving them vulnerable to attack by more powerful units. However, skirmishers were unable to turn a battle themselves. Their weapons were inadequate for that task and they were always enormously vulnerable to slaughter by cavalry. As a skirmisher, you'd only get one shot (if lucky) against a charging horseman, which was very likely to miss, then you were essentially defenseless and unable to escape. The only defense infantry had against cavalry at the time was the square formation: and that required a large, organized mass of men in line. In reality, line battles end up resembling complicated chess matches, with each piece using the weapons best suited to their role. Rifle-armed skirmishers would be out front trying to harass the enemy, line infantry backing them up and providing the heavy assault power, and cavalry always lurking behind or on the wings, looking for opportunities to destroy a unit in a moment of confusion.

            "answer_text": "Other people have already addressed why line formations were used and their effectiveness in battle so I'll talk more about individual motivation. First, consider that not all soldiers had a choice. Many governments have used conscription to raise armies. Then couple that with penalties (often execution) for things like desertion, failing to obey a lawful order, and cowardice in the face of the enemy. The idea being go into battle and you might die, but refuse and we will kill you. There may also be other incentives like \"don't fight and not only are you a traitor but your family will lose everything too.\" Next, there is a critical piece of human psychology that basically boils down to \"it won't happen to me.\" Criminals commit crimes knowing full well what punishments they might suffer because they don't expect to be caught. People have unprotected sex knowing the risks of pregnancy and STDs because they simply don't expect it to happen to them. And soldiers will go into battle believing that while their buddies fall all around them, they will be all right because of divine protection, superior skill, good luck, or whatever other thought soothes their worries (obviously these are generalities as some people very much worry about what will happen to them but that can take us on a whole other tangent). Finally, many cultures indoctrinate their people to believe that battle is honorable and glorifying. Those that die in battle will get a free pass into heaven, be heroes/legends, or whatever. Armies later codified these into actual awards and medals. Consider that one award that is considered very honorable in the US is the Purple Heart, which is held in great esteem right up along side or even greater than awards for valor and bravery in combat. How do you get a Purple Heart? You get wounded or killed by enemy action. In a sense, it's an award that you didn't actually do anything to earn. It's been jokingly referred to as the \"enemy marksmanship badge\" for that reason. I'm not trying to disparage anyone who has been wounded, but that is a great example of how you keep morale up even in the face of casualties.  Napoleon once said \"Give me enough medals and I'll win you any war.\" ",
