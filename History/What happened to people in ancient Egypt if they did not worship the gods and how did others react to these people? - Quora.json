            "answer_text": "IF they \u201cbelieved but did not worship\u201d they were punished by the Gods directly in proportion to their lack of reverence (with deference to prior acts of faith, if applicable). IF they \u201cdid not believe and did not worship\u201d then they were punished by society in proportion to society\u2019s reverence for the Gods and disdain for the wicked. IF they \u201cdid not believe and did not worship and society did not believe and did not worship\u201d then the Gods punished all of them by walking away and leaving them to whatever new, crappier gods they invented to punish themselves. Thus, the more important question? What happened in Ancient Egypt when the Gods no longer believed that the worshipers were worth handing out gifts to? They let Egypt fall into the sands\u2026 and under the sway of new Gods and God Kings and atheists and clerics and madmen and scientists and bakers and bottle cleaners. What happened to the Gods though? Dunno. Ask them. But, for anyone, when you let go of the Old Gods, there are always new devils ready to take their throne. Enjoy your day! :) Throneless, John ",

The reason for the occasional of Christian was not about their beliefs and religious practices as Christian but their refusal to make the sacrifices that were compulsory for subject of the Roman Empire. Christians who accepted to make the required sacrifices were not bothered by Roman authorities but there was conflict between them and the other Christians who had suffered consequences for their refusal.
