            "answer_text": "I think these differences are difficult to see until enough decades have gone by to begin to see patterns that appear only in retrospect. For example, I doubt people living in 1901 saw a dramatic change in that one year in a way that was obvious at the time. Still, that being said, we are almost 20 years into the new millennium, and some patterns are beginning to emerge. First, the 20th Century was the \u201cAmerican Century\u201d in which each major crisis\u2014WWI, WWII, and even the ending of the Cold War\u2014 always left the United States in a more dominant position than before. The Vietnam War was just a bump in the road. In the 21st Century, the USA has not yet been dislodged, but it is characterized by having to compete against many rivals, notably China. The election of Donald Trump may have been brought about, in part, by the frustration average Americans feel about this. Another difference is that in the 21st Century, this is the century in which climate change can no longer be ignored \u2014 the nations of the world must face a very serious situation, or disregard it at their peril. In the 20th Century, the \u201cecology\u201d and \u201cenvironmental\u201d movements seemed like \u201cside shows\u201d \u2014 just another one of those \u201chippie\u201d demands \u2014 but unless Republicans are content with most of Florida going underwater, the issue can no longer be dismissed as a fringe concern.

            "answer_text": "In the 20th Century white men held almost all the power. For most of the 20th Century women were regarded as the second sex. Homosexuality was mostly illegal. In the 21st Century white men hold more power than their share of global population but nothing like as much as the 20th Century. (Most Influential People) In the 21st Century women are the 1.5th sex in wealthy countries and still the second sex in poor ones. Homosexuality is legal in rich nations. ",
