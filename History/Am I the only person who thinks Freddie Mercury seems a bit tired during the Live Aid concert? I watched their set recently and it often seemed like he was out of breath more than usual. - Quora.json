Music that could bring the masses together, and he had the personality and stage presence to back it up. As energetic of a performance as he strove to put on, he\u2019s still human and he\u2019s gonna sweat, he\u2019s gonna be short of breath, but the one thing he didn\u2019t stop doing was making the fans in the crowd feel as though they were a part of it all. Of course they were tired too. A gigantic crowd that had been there for hours, they\u2019re bound to be. He made them feel important, and not just a passing \u201cYou guys are amazing!\u201d comment, but a physically and vocally engaging set. The rest of the band were tired as well, but were dumbfounded as to why he was so adamant on doing what he was doing, and how he made it look so easy controlling every single person in this huge arena, but he did it. To this day, it\u2019s lauded as one of the best live shows of any musician in rock music history. ",

            "answer_text": "I may make myself unpopular here but by the time Live Aid came along Queen were way past their prime. Having grown up with them I felt their best years were up to about 1980 - after which they were mediocre at best. This wasn\u2019t helped that the LP \u201cQueen\u2019s Greatest Hits\u201d distilled all their hits but left out all the more out-of-character album tracks that might have diluted their legacy. I\u2019m willing to bet that many people who consider themselves Queen fans do so on the basis of that album and have never listened to the original albums from which they were drawn. If they had they\u2019d realise that they had more breadth than their singalong hits suggest (see \u201cSheer Heart Attack\u201d for one of their best) and I\u2019ve never met a self-declared fan who\u2019s proved me wrong on that charge. Of course radio play doesn\u2019t help but it does nothing to say that they were anything better than Bohemian Rhapsody or We Will Rock You when there are so many hidden gems waiting to be discovered. So, for everyone who just owns the greatest hits, buy the original bloody albums and appreciate the full band - especially John Deacon who wrote more hits than Freddie Mercury ever did. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is quite simple, it was an incredibly hot day. It was the hottest day of that summer, according to the Live Aid documentary. Freddie always placed a lot of effort into his performances. If you watch Queen live at the Bowl (Milton Keynes 1982), you will see that Freddie is as sweaty as he was on the Live Aid performance, after a few songs. Although, some people have noticed that Freddie had marks on his arm, which could have been Kaposi sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma Is one of the first or most obvious signs of Aids, it is a type of skin cancer, that can effect your internal organs, throat, mouth, nose and obviously your skin. You can see a bruise on Freddie\u2019s arm, just above the arm band. But, it is speculation, it could just have been a normal bruise.  Edit, to add that Kaposi Sarcoma legions doesn\u2019t just disappear. The bruise on Freddie\u2019s arm could not be seen during the Magic tour. Therefore it was probably just a bruise. ",

I do know that just about anyone would be tired giving the kind of performance he did. If you look at how much he was sweating, well, that would certainly take a lot out of a person in their late 30\u2019s. I\u2019m guessing it must have been rather warm at the time. And they were under a great deal of stress to do well at Live Aid. The concert in South Africa hurt their image (even though they clearly did not support apartheid), as did in America the \u201cI Want to be Free\u201d video. Guess I will have to check out some of the concerts they did before I was born and compare. ",

There is speculation that Freddie was infected some time in the 70\u2019s. He was having fatigue and vocal problems by the time Live Aid happened. I have friends in opera and on Broadway and even when they are healthy they come off stage exhausted. Queen and Freddie gave what is widely considered THE best live performance in rock in front of the biggest audience in the world. It\u2019s a miracle he didn\u2019t collapse onstage. ",
