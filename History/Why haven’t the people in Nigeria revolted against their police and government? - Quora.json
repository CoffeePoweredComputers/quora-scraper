            "answer_text": "Why haven't the people in Nigeria revolted against their Police and government? They haven't done this because they don't know what the consequence will be or if they are prepared for the consequence. Nigeria is a complex society consisting of different regions, religions, laws, and tribes. One part of the country practices Sharia law, another part practices common law based on British laws. And the police is supposed to enforce everyone's laws? The whole country is supposed to be practicing democracy. And many parts of it are practicing autocracy. It's always a big deal getting a mass of Nigerians to agree on one thing. Everybody always has valid different opinions. Hence the difficulty in Nigerians revolting against their Police and government. ",
