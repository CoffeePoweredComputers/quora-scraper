            "answer_text": "No they weren\u2019t. The term is often incorrectly used to the whole of the medieval period, that is from the fall of Rome to the fall of Byzantia or the Battle of Bosworth in the UK - which are roughly the same times (1453 /1485). However, it should be used, in Britain at least, to cover the period from the Romans leaving Britain (a debated time and occurrence, but that\u2019s another question) in the C5th to the Norman conquest of 1066 and subsequent Twelfth Century Renaissance, the rediscovry of classical culture. This suggests that we know a large amount about Roman Britain, and little about the Anglo-Saxon and Viking migration. This isn\u2019t true. The archaeological evidence is pretty good for this period. There are people writing about the times, although most of the contemperaneous writings are from a small number of sources, primarily the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, and the Venerable Bede. These resources are obviously biased. Bede certainly complains about a loss of culture and lack of Christianity, as he had a very specific agenda. He is telling us that the time is darkened by paganism, but this is an opinion and not a fact. What we see in the written record of the monasteries is people like Bede, with an agenda and a bias towards Rome writing about change. It is in human nature to often view all change as bad. This has greatly tainted our view that the times were bad and inward looking. The period saw a great growth in agriculture, and innovations, such as the horse collar, use of horse shoes and heavy plough, which all came together to increase the ability to make land fertile. The AS Chronicles also have a wealth of information, but interspaced with rather random pieces, the one about dragons: A.D. 793. This year came dreadful fore-warnings over the land of the Northumbrians, terrifying the people most woefully: these were immense sheets of light rushing through the air, and whirlwinds, and fiery, dragons flying across the firmament. These tremendous tokens were soon followed by a great famine: and not long after, on the sixth day before the ides of January in the same year, the harrowing inroads of heathen men made lamentable havoc in the church of God in Holy-island, by rapine and slaughter. Now, a certain amount of interpretation can be used here (assuming we didn\u2019t have a dragon infestation), nonetheless, it tells us that storms happened and there was a famine, which seems quite legitimate. Archaeology of the period shows great change, and the DNA record again shows the migration of people from Europe, first from the Germanic areas, the Anglo-Saxon migration, and then the northern areas, the so called Viking invasions. The Saxon migration is often described as an invasion, and certainly any people entering a new area and casing displacement will be seen negatively. The settlements of vikings in the danelaw across North East England suggests that the Vikings were settling farmers, and the image of rape and pillage is probably, like horned horned helmets, partly fictional. Change can certainly be observed, in terms of culture, agriculture, technology and religion. That does not in itself, mean that the period was a dark one. It was certainly in the interest of the Christian writers from the time and from later, to draw the paganism as a time of chaos and darkness, and the subsequent re-establishment of the Christianity as the end of this chaos. This has polluted our view of the period, and produced a romanticised idea of war, anarchy, and chaos. The archaeological record does not support this. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going to try to argue in a quantitative way that the dark ages really were dark as far as mathematical progress is concerned; and it seems to me that  mathematical progress is probably a reasonable proxy for the progress of what we would now call science. You can get a glimpse of the case I'm going to make just by glancing at the MacTutor History of Mathematics archive (http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/BiogIndex.html). This is a list of all the mathematicians we remember today. Note how few biographies there are in 500-1500 AD and note that the vast majority of the biographies in that range are outside of Europe! Anyway: I'm going to produce here an edited list of mathematicians from the MacTutor archive.  First, I won't list any mathematicians outside of Europe, since that is where our focus is (we know that the rest of the world did not have a dark age in 500-1500).  Secondly, I'm not going to list every scholar in the archive (though it wouldn't change matters much if I did); the issue is that, rather annoyingly, the MacTutor archive lists many scholars whose mathematical contributions are minor; for example, Plato is listed on the strength of his contributions to philosophy with a biography that remarks that he made no original contributions to mathematics. Consequently, I am only going to list names I encountered as attached to a theorem or a technique  in the course of getting my (undergraduate) math education.   You may reply that this isn't very objective, and you'd be right, but its decent and the best I can do at the moment. If we wanted to be more objective at the expense of greater effort we could presumably count mentions in mathematics textbooks. I'm also open to being corrected if I neglected to mention someone or included someone who shouldn't be on the list.  Here goes - name followed by birth year, up to 1650 AD.

None of this is to say that people weren't working on mathematics in 500-1500 AD. But somehow the sort of major discoveries that cause us to remember the discoverers today weren't made much. ",
