            "answer_text": "It\u2019s in the nature of history books that they are regularly rewritten. It is naive to think that it is possible to write a definitive history which says everything about a period or topic, and which can never be improved. Historians are forever reevaluating the work of their predecessors and rewriting them in an effort to correct earlier errors and omissions. Then more historians rewrite the rewrites, and so on, ad infinitum. That\u2019s how history works. This happens for a number of reasons. The main one is that reality is incredibly complex. Every minute of every day, millions of things happen (let\u2019s call these happenings \u2018facts\u2019). It\u2019s the job of historians to make sense of a selection of those millions of facts (a selection because it\u2019s impossible for one historian to deal with them all) and to weave them together into a narrative. Once one historian has done this, another historian reads what they\u2019ve written and thinks that they\u2019ve omitted some important facts, and/or misinterpreted some of them, and/or put too much emphasis on some at the expense of others. So they write their own version of the events, which a third historian reads and thinks needs improvement, and so on. Other reasons are that new facts often emerge, when, say, \u2018new\u2019 letters from the people concerned are discovered, or archaeologists dig up some new evidence. It is impossible to ever reach a final consensus about the past. That\u2019s a good thing, not bad. It\u2019s right that we constantly revisit and reinterpret the past. The idea that the past is set in stone and unable to \u2018change\u2019 is I think a very dangerous one. We have to be ready to rethink our views of what our ancestors were up to, and why. So \u2018people are trying to rewrite the history books\u2019 because that\u2019s what thoughtful people with enquiring minds do, and we should all be very glad that they do. ",

            "answer_text": "The implication of this question seems to be that history is accurately known, fixed, unalterable - and should no doubt be printed once and for all on very high quality paper, bound in leather and left alone for ever. There is the further implication that it has something akin to scriptural status and that to rewrite it is some kind of act of sacrilege \u2026 or at the very least a form of mischief-making and distortion. There is no longer any role for historians, except possibly to fill in a few gaps and pass on the contents of the weighty leather-bound volumes to future generations. To accept such views amounts to saying there is no role for enquiry, for research or rethinking previous interpretations. However, there is no such thing as complete knowledge of any set of events or period in the past and no scope for trying to examine previous assumptions and interpretations. That view is completely at odds with the spirit of enquiry. ",
