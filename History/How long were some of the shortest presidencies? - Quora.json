            "answer_text": "My vote goes to Mustafa Abd\u00fclhalik Renda, the Turkish president who served a single day. It probably did not even last 24 hours, beginning on 10th of October and ending on 11th of October 1938.  Renda was the chairman of parliament. I\u2019m not sure if any other countries have similar rules, but in Turkey in the case that the current president is unable to serve (i.e. dead) the chairman of parliament shall replace them as a provisional president until a proper replacement can be picked. And with M.K. Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s passing away on the 10th of October he immediately took power. Turkey at the time hadn\u2019t employed presidential elections so it was up to the ruling party to pick the president. Also in the 1930s Turkey was (for the most part) a single party state which probably made the process even easier. Within a day it was decided to have \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc become the next president and on the 11th of October Renda\u2019s reign ended ever so shortly. Turkey has had several other provisional presidents, but honestly this guy holds the national record with only one day in power. ",
