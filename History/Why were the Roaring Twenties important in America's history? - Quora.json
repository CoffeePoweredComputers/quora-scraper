            "answer_text": "The \u201cRoaring Twenties,\u201d which was actually a period from about 1923 to late 1929, is important in three respects: 1) Setting the economic stage for the Great Depression and the government takeover of the economy, and ultimately, society; 2) the rise of a consumer society; and 3) the rise of self-awareness and the culture of self. These factors played a significant role in making the Twenties \u201croar.\u201d I\u2019ll address only in broad strokes. The Twenties are known as a decade of a surging economy, and the stock market\u2014 it seemed like even the shoe shine boy had his investments, and hot tips. But the driving force was an inflationary and expansionist economic policy, imposed by the government, and enabled and facilitated by the Federal Reserve. Those policies created a hot economy, but also set the stage for the Great Depression: When the economy could no longer absorb the artificially-induced inflation and expansion, it corrected in a way that was as robust as the expansion had been. (The government then exacerbated the downturn with even worse policies, but that\u2019s off the subject here.) At the same time, businesses were looking for ways to enjoy the prosperity but have protection from the rigors of free market competition. At first, they tried voluntary associations to regulate production, prices, and labor. But there were always competitors who would not comply with the voluntary constraints. Ultimately, business sought out the coercive power of the government, and by the late 20s the administrative state\u2014 government regulation of business and industry\u2014 was emerging from an embryonic phase that had begun in the decade before the Great War. The confluence of the Depression and the administrative state laid the groundwork for the economic structure that arose during the FDR presidency, and which we continue to live with today. That is, while business influenced political decisions, the government\u2014 the State\u2014 took increasing control over the economy, as well as increasing control over society in general. Today, we think that such government control over our lives is both natural and beneficial. Thus, the Twenties became remembered as a \u201croaring\u201d\u2014 even lawless\u2014 era because it was the last time that the economy and citizens had full control over their lives. One of the effects of the surging economy of the Twenties was the explosion of the consumer economy. For several decades, consumer goods had been available, but they became ubiquitous with the advent of mass production and widespread electrification. Vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, Victrolas\u2014 you name it\u2014 filled homes. And when you weren\u2019t home, you were, for the first time, probably in your car. In one year, Ford produced over two million Model Ts. No annual production of a car would exceed that until the 1950\u2019s; overall production of Model Ts would not be surpassed until 1972 (Volkwagen Beetle). One of the little-known developments was cutting cloth on the bias, which revolutionized fashion. The bias cut allowed cloth to fall naturally over the body, and the stylized fashions of prior decades gave way to the sheer, and far less complex, dress of the Twenties. (Picture a \u201cflapper,\u201d and that A-line, knee length, drop waist dress was made possible by cutting cloth on the bias.) So in the Twenties, for really the first time, people had access to\u2014 and could afford\u2014 things beyond the basic necessities of life. When the Depression hit, it was made worse\u2014 at least psychologically\u2014 by the sudden unavailability of things that the public had become used to. And when prosperity returned after WWII, it was, and continues to be, marked by the widespread availability of consumer goods. But perhaps the most remarkable development of the Twenties was the change in how people saw themselves. The work of Freud and others was gaining influence. Sexuality and self-examination entered popular thinking. Indeed, much of the culture of the Twenties\u2014 consumerism (including stocks), apparent nihilism\u2014 could be seen as a movement towards discovery of the self. The notions of individual struggle and suffering became widespread in literature. When the Depression hit, there was backlash\u2014 socialism, communism. But the Twenties saw a reawakening of the principle of the individual as the basic unit of society, and that principle has driven our culture, society, economics, and politics ever since. So the Roaring Twenties was important because that era developed the concepts of large government, consumerism, and individualism\u2014 with all the inherent conflicts and contradictions\u2014 that define our society today.
