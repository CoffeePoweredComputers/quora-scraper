            "answer_text": "Democracy is really profitable for the 51% Democracy is an endless meat grinder where the 51% is everything, and the 49% are just there to enslave, vote away their wealth, rights, and kill them if you have majority votes. Because it is do not matter how terrible the end result is, it was democratic, so it makes it right. Right? The power is the mob. If you manage to gather more useful idiots under your flag, you can do whatever you want. 50%+1vote means everything. You can round up all that pesky 49.99% and gun them down or gas them, because DEMOCRACY!! This is the true face of democracy. And that\u2019s why the USA did not made as one. It is a republic. Or it was. Where not even 90% of nazis can vote 10% jews into gas chambers. And also, its difficult if those pesky jews armed to the teeth thanks to the 2nd amendment. And this is why we need gun control, and assault rifle ban. Right? Than it will be easy. If you don\u2019t want to live in a society where the more than 50% can vote away your rights if you fall into the less than 50%, than you are not a democrat.  ",

            "answer_text": "No. Life is not profitable to everyone in society, what would make you think democracy or any other system of governance might be profitable to everyone? Democratic republics with capitalism as the economic system for the country is the most profitable for the most people and the most profitable for the country as a whole of all systems every attempted. I am curious to know what would inspire you to ask this question. There is an implication that somehow democracy is deficient if it is not profitable for everyone. Is that the unspoken idea of the question? Is it to find something to justify the abandonment of democracy because it fails to provide profitability to everyone? I see that another has replied and chosen to take the term \u201cdemocracy\u201d literally and to make a perfectly reasonable discussion of the ancient (Greek and Roman) democracies that failed because they did not take into account what will happen if a pure democracy of majority rules is the system. I suspect the person asking the question did not intend the discussion to be about pure democracy, but rather about the kind of democratic republics we and most western countries have. To that end, I will say that our system comes very close to working as one might hope for, but that we have been assailed since the 1930\u2019s and the advent of Progressivism with attempts to use our very democratic republic laws and governance to turn us away from what it is meant to be and turn toward socialism and eventually communism. Each generation of politicians have managed to work their will on the people and play on their natural tendencies to be attracted to programs and policies that promise things to them for free and without personal responsibility but with more and more dependency on the government. This entire plan since the 1960\u2019s has had no positive effect on reducing poverty while steadily increasing the cost of supporting more and more people. It is exactly what the Progressives want because eventually the capitalist system that provides the wealth to support these socialist concepts will be unable to overcome the imbalance between those who produce wealth and those who do not. Margarete Thatcher, Prime Minister of England, once famously said of socialism: \u201cIt is a great idea until you run out of money\u201d (or words to that effect). ",
