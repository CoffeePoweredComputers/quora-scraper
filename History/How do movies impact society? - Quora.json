            "answer_text": "It depends on who you ask, and what you personally see as harmful to society. Like books, or TV shows, radio, and other media, it is a tool meant to convey information and stories, and it can be used for good or ill. Birth of A Nation made in 1915 is an example of a movie that was harmful to society. It was a love letter to the Ku Klux Klan. It showed cultural support for racism and incited violence against blacks in many cities. On the other side, Schindler\u2019s List and Life is Beautiful shows that even in times of terrible societal injustice, there are those that can rise above it and assert the best of humanity. If those movies convey anything, it is that we have a responsibility to stand in the face of injustice, and protect the ones we love. The fact that we can make movies like that shows that our society, although at times flawed, is still healthy and resilient. And that\u2019s at the core of this question, isn\u2019t it? Movies can be indicators of our society. Suppose a new love letter to white supremacy was released in 2018, that would be an indicator of our society, that is, if it gained any traction in the box office. A better indicator is that we have BlackKlansman being released a year after the Charlottesville tragedy. As long as movies, books, and the media can criticize our government, it is an indicator that our society is stable and healthy. When criticism of government is no longer a viable option or is run by the state, that is an indicator that our society has been harmed. So in essence, I am arguing that lack of film, or media is more harmful than good, which I think is one of the core principles of the movie Fahrenheit 451. Those that like to blame a person\u2019s bad behavior on books, movies, video games, or a podcast they listened to are externalizing the problem. In the end, we are the arbiter of our lives. It\u2019s what separates the social drinker from the alcoholic., someone playing a few hands of blackjack and a Compulsive Gambler. And those that can\u2019t separate reality from film have bigger problems than watching the movie Superman and think they come from the planet Krypton. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the impact of cinema on society is exaggerated, certainly in a context like India. Movies depend on an age old belief that in essence everyone is a good person.  This is what makes us identify with the protagonist, while quietly wanting the antagonist to be destroyed. If society has indeed changed to appreciate evil, we would have a lot of movies with the dark side winning, making fun of the good people!  This has not happened. What we have seen change is how we are dealing with the dark side in stories a little more comfortably these days, because cinema as a medium has become nuanced and sophisticated, and we are not afraid of some subjects as we may have been years ago. It is also due to the realization that movies don't really affect us that profoundly, and we treat them like books or games or any other source of entertainment, leisure, or escape, although movies are certainly captivating at some level and hold us entrapped for a limited period of time. We're not giving into belief!  We're just allowing ourselves to suspend disbelief! This is a natural reaction to movies, since we as audiences are passively most benefiting when we do this. When our world views or views of the human condition are reinforced, we tend to react positively, and relax through the experience, even allow ourselves emotional involvement.  When they are challenged, we allow disengagement, and become objective.  So we're essentially in control, and hence movies can't really influence us that much in the limited space and time engagement we have with them. Sometimes, in our exaggerated sense of influence movies have over us, we should wonder how bad hardly ever wins in movies, but a lot of people will try a lot of bad things despite watching a large number of movies! Just like movies are a series of temporal events, they have temporal effects on us, because we allow them to.  They can hardly be significant enough as illusions.  They cannot even by any design, cross over to our reality perception, leave alone influencing us beyond that. ",

            "answer_text": "Movies can have a huge impact on society , and have changed our cultural norms drastically. When people view films they watch People better looking than they are , with more interesting lives and more money do things that they want to emulate . If their favorite star is seen treating their kids a certain way in a film, this makes people comfortable with doing the same, or \u201cnormalizes \u201c it. There is definitely a chicken and egg thing , where we will always argue about whether movies are a mirror reflecting us or a leader influencing how we behave . I used to think it was more of a reflection , but I have changed my mind. I now believe films are a very strong influencer, especially as we have become more secular . R eligion used to be a strong influence, but that is fading. \u201cHonor thy mother and father \u201c has been replaced with \u201cworship thy daughter and son\u201d. i Saw a film from the 1930s where a kid broke a neighbors window, and the guy went to spank the kid . He asked \u201cdo you want pants up, or down?\u201d .. \u2026 seems shocking today , but from a time when people trusted other adults to discipline their kids Adults used to be in it together to teach kids , today \u201cit\u2019s me and my kids (and my lawyer ) against the world\u201d. In Europe where lawsuit awards are small the effect is less. . Today , you are more likely to see a kid in a movie belittle an adult neighbor for saying a cuss word or some other infraction judged wrong by the child. I trace the origin to 1996 in the movie \u201c7\u201d. In it Morgan Freeman advises Brad Pitt , who has a pregnant wife G Paltrow: \u201c When you have that chall you spoil that chall every chance you get \u201c\u2026 sounded like good advice at the time, I mean, what could go wrong ?I ",

            "answer_text": "Of course YES. Film industry is a mass media, there is bound to be heavy impact on its audience. The influence of films in our society is bidirectional.Society reflects in movies and in turn movies influence society. There is a thread reflection in both. The Indian society, across every state is a very conservative one. 80 years back if one would time travel and show our previous generation the present state of our society, none of them would accept it or believe it, or even look down upon people who live them. Lets leave the negatives of film industry like masala movies and item songs for a moment. Lets turn our focus towards good movies with positive content. These movies have definitely influenced even the lowest strata of people in our society, who have no access to good books or have the opportunity of interacting with really broad minded people. Good movies have made the society think positively, it has stood for women empowerment, it has helped to break notions of dowry, it has helped people to digest women remarriage, it has helped to break mindless superstitious beliefs, It has brought out a good understanding of the urban and rural, It has helped people to understand about relationships, movies have helped the society help get out from the cluster of caste, Movies have made a concept called 'love' acceptable for our rather prim society.  Not only that, good movies have promoted our culture faces like carnatic music, hindusthani music, barathanatiyam etc. It has helped convey about our history and mythologies to the next generation. Good movies like Roja and Bombay have promoted patriotism.  On the other hand \"worst\" movies, have justified voilence, rape, murder, chauvnism and so on. It has probably commercialized every element in the movie. Lets not waste anymore time reflecting on them. Movies are a powerful weapon. It can sway the way a society thinks. Provided it goes into the hands of good directors with good, positive and broad thinking like Balachandar, K.Vishwanath, Balumahendra, Barathiraja, Mani Rathnam, Fazil, Visu and so on. But there are other directors who don't realize the importance of this medium and the ways where they can use it constructively for the society. Being a director of a movie is a great responsibility, even if your movies don't have a striking impact, it should not pull down the society back to its stone ages. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, until the internet in the late part of the last cebtury and before television in the early part of it cinema was the main medium by which news, propaganda, culture and morality were received. American cinema particularly has culturally ainfluenced the whole world and continues too. In Plato's writing Socrates describes, in 400bc(2419years ago), society as being inside a cave watching shadow puppets reflected onto the wall. Cinema is basically the same thing. Life imitating art imitating life. It has had and continues to have a huge influence on society and apes the model of ancient civilisations. Whether they are as important now is different. The internet , thankfully allows for a sort of variety and set of alternatives, albeit alternatives embedded in complex technology for transmission. This I think has led to the pervasive and popular notion of fake news and propaganda. There is no doubt fake news but their is also now no dominant perspective because their is no dominant medium. Which inevitably leads to differences in perspective. Expecting one \u201ctruth\u201d and clarity in terms of how events are interpreted is difficult particularly when both mediums have interplay and in turn have their own affect on events. If you choose to ignore these factors or are oblivious to them and have been influenced unknowingly then you will probably be stuck in a sort of self righteous echo chamber where your perspective is constantly compounded by the absence of awareness of these significant factors in the way media has and continues to change.

            "answer_text": "This is really something we should be asking ourselves everytime before going for a film. So let me start with a story. Once there was a kingdom in ancient India with a very intelligent king. The people of the kingdom were really happy with their lives. They loved their king and worshipped him like a god. The king too, was very focused on the welfare of the kingdom and his citizens. He took each and every decision keeping in mind the welfare of his citizens. Art and culture flourished in his reign. Everyone was happy, but something really unfortunate happened then. There broke out a riot between two groups in the kingdom, it started with a few people and then spread across the town and then to neighbouring towns and in a matter of time many parts of the kingdom were seen blazing in fire. Many innocent people lost their lives for no reason, a huge amount of public and private property was damaged. After the riots cooled down and stopped every innocent citizen wanted justice and looked upon their king to deliver him. The king was in a fix on how to accuse someone, there was no face to a crowd he couldnot simply punish anyone as that would be unfair and immoral. So he decided to punish the people who were responsible for it. The next day the chief leader, the chief of security and the chief film maker in the kingdom were summoned to the court of justice. The king ordered 50 whips on the body of the minister as a punishment because he failed in maintaining non partisanship. He ordered 100 whips on the body of because he failed to maintain harmony in the society during the riots. But to the astonishment of everyone the king order the highest punishment of 500 whips to the film maker. Shocked with the judgement the film maker asked the king about the reason of his punishment to which the king replied that he was the reason to shape the opinion of the crowd which started the riots in the first place. The king mentioned that a kingdom with an intelligent film maker cannot have such kind of outbursts of citizens and that is the reason the film maker was considered the real culprit. I hope by this short story you would have clearly understood the role of films and the film makers in our society and how important it is to have intelligent films and film makers in the society ",

            "answer_text": "First off, it's hard to argue with the fact that the movies have been the dominant form of popular art for the last 100 years.  I'm inclined to agree with this quote by Andy Warhol: \u201cIt\u2019s the movies that have really been running things in America ever since they were invented. They show you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, how to feel about it, and how to look how you feel about it.\" I remember that when I was a kid reading old books and articles, they suggested that it was usual for most people to dream in black and white - and that it was very unusual to dream in color.  I was intrigued, because I always dreamed in color.  So did everyone else I asked.  Why would they claim this? My intuition seems to be backed up by studies. See this essay, for instance: Why Did We Think We Dreamed in Black and White?A study in 1942 of college sophomores revealed that 72% 'never' or 'rarely' experienced color in their dreams.  Today, those reporting not experiencing color in their dreams is a much smaller percentage.  What is the most logical explanation for this?  That movies (and TV) of the time were predominately black and white, and therefore people DREAMED in black and white - or at least remembered their dreams that way. ",

Recently, before the general election in India, to try and influence the opinion of the masses, a movie about the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was released.Movies influence our knowledge about history. How about I tell you that the movie The imitation game was more fiction than a biopic (How Accurate Is The Imitation Game? We\u2019ve Separated Fact From Fiction.)?Movies make for a great conversation topic. We all love to suggest movies and ask for reviews.Movies are a great tool to raise awareness. 6. Movies are business.  7. Movies help learn languages. Well, not really learn them, but once you know the language, you can master it by learning new phrases, idioms and words. That\u2019s how it is working for me. 8. Movies influence crime and sometimes glorify it (15 Films That Inspired Real Life Crimes).

            "answer_text": "I think that the problems with films is that they become the TRUTH. A major historian in Great Britain, Antonia Fraser, wrote a book about Queen Elizabeth 1 and Mary queen of scots. In this book she stated categorically that these two women never met. Then a film was made on the subject. In the film the two queens meet. Next minute her friends are telling her that her book was wrong. I would assume that someone of AF\u2019s standing has friends who are more intelligent than the average citizen of the UK. Yet they believed the film before they believed a woman who must have spent years in studying every page she could get on the Queen Elizabeth and MQoS. We all do this to a greater or lesser extent. One of my favourite films was called \u201cThe First of the Few\u201d. This film describes the design and building of the Spitfire. There are many points in it that I now know are incorrect but one of the reasons for this is the construction of the film in a form that can be shown in limited space of time and that can also have drama in it. The story in a film must also \u2018entertain\u2019 where as the book, if it is to be considered a true history on a given subject must stick to the facts. The problem I find is that, if I have read the book first then, I will usually be disappointed by the film. If I see the film first then the hero/heroine in the book will be come the hero when I read the book. Bernard Cornwell, author of the Sharpe\u2019s books now sees the person who played Sharpe in the film, Sean Bean, in his mind\u2019s eye when he re-reads one of his books. Most people will go to see a film, like it or hate it but, unless they dig farther into the story (presuming it is based on fact) that will become the Truth. ",

For example if a movie focuses on highlighting the negative character more to the audience it can have a bad impact on some people(e.g a person shot at lot of people during a show of dark night rises because in some strange way he was attached with Joker of dark night more and not with the protagonist i.e batman).Whereas when a movie intends to highlight the protagonist more it might not have a bad impact on us infact it will inspire us to do good e.g legend of Bhagat singh will not have any bad impact on an indian or even society as a whole. Lets touch another side of this.If i am an uneducated person not having the intellect to understand what is good or bad for me,its likely that i'll start smoking after seeing SRK's smoking STYLE in DON just because it looks really cool. These Grey shaded roles can make a person(especially a person who dont understand what is a grey shaded role), do things that are not appropriate for him/her.This is an example where we can say it depends on the person seeing the movie plus the intellect that a person possesses. I can't remember a movie that had a bad impact on me..whereas i have a lot that inspires me to be a better person in life.Thanks for ASking to Answer...this i my second answer on quora..thanks for making me write.:) ",

            "answer_text": "Movies, one of the best entertainment I choose to relax after a hectic day. In the movies the characters portrayed by the actors are actually out of the society only. Though the imagination & creativity of the director creeps into a movie but still they draw inspirations from the real life only. Every movie director carry a view point & builds the whole movie with their thoughts hence the movie runs on the lines of the directors thoughts. According to me good movies do impact the society as such movies send a social message to the people. While bad movies need to be ignored. In reality its happening other way round. The bad content with more violence & visually disturbed depiction of the characters are reaching faster with the crowds. So, this means that impact can be either ways & it depends upon us to decide rather protesting & agitating against it I think we should not curb the freedom of the creative people which will further hamper the process of film making. Movie is a medium to entertain people with humorous, thrilling & adventurous contents at the same time need to convey a social message to remind the audiences for the same. ",

Like we have the heroes, heroines and villains - the end result is the end of bad characters. This also teachers us that bad actions leads to bad results.Films based on epics Ramyana and Mahabharta etc teach us about the lives of incarnations of Lord Vishnu (Lord Rama and Lord Krishana). These tell us that Lord Vishnu had to incarnate for removing the evil from the society.Films on autobiographies and biographies of great philosophers and thinkers shed light on their ways of living and these provide us with huge treasure of knowledge.Film music delights us.",

            "answer_text": " A film if interpreted correctly by the masses can have a surprisingly overwhelming effect on people. A film essentially acts like a key to the directors mind for the viewers, through one can delve into the thought process of the director. it is up to the directer to decide wether to use this influential position to educate people for the betterment of society or not. A recent example to support my claim would be the Bollywood film \u2018Padman\u2019 by the director R Balki.   This film is a true story based on the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, the inventor of low-cost sanitary pads for rural indian women. Although to people living in metropolitan cities this may not seem to be huge problem, the film depicts the social stigma still attached to the natural process of menstruation. By choosing such a topic the director chose to highlight such a huge problem about something so fundamental. I am sure that many men who earlier ignored the issues of women surely left the theatre with a new outlook on the problems faced by women. Films can also be a medium to propagate the motivational lives of many personalities to the masses and to create a sense of purpose in the many ,misguided youngsters in the world who might do something useful in their lives and contribute towards building a better tomorrow ",

But most of the people failed to understand the right thing and wrong thing.Who define the right thing and wrong thing. I say our mind does.we naturally have the ability to understand the basic rights and wrong thing.But if wrong thing normalise in movies eventually they start to belive it's not a problem to doing that kind of stuff. For eg. Let's talk about arjun reddy .In real life I don't think any woman can tolerate his character. I always say to my friend. If the heroine doesn't love him back for sure he will be the villain in that movie. Is that arjun reddy is the wrong thing here? Nope it's audience problem .There is lot of life changing movies and -ve impacting movies . We are not adult enough to take everything in right sense. ",

I personally will never be a detective, or fight vampires but i can watch a movie about it and get an overall sense of what it would be like to be the character, and still identify with the character based on personal beliefs and habits. that is why film is so important to society, and film will continue to be important to society in the same way that books have always been important.

The latter\u2019s impact was to start a technological improvement in special effects in movies (and by extention, decades later, to spill over to video games). Jaws reduced the number of people who vacationed at beaches the summer it came out (which is silly, the sharks were always there, and they didn\u2019t see the movie). But as I mentioned and didn\u2019t think of before I started writing, Jaws changed the way movies are distributed.

In a sense, the director is able to take control over these inputs to each audience member's mind.   At the same time, the director is imparting a very similar experience to hundreds, thousands, or even millions of individuals at the same time.  In the years leading up to World War II, both Nazi and Soviet propaganda experts recognized the importance of film in imparting ideology to the masses, one individual at a time.  Excellent sources for reading up on this in detail (if you are interested) are Sigfried Kracauer's From Caligari to Hitler and Lotte Eisner's The Haunted Screen. ",

Best one was \u201cWithout effort you can't get anything, if you get anything without effort it's not going to stay with you\u201d. I am following that all over my life and I'm never running over easy money. Even Director Shankar well known for movies Robot, I and many depicts a social message through every film and almost all films are blockbusters. Just people loved his message in great way.Yeah society affects films. Else where would we getting these amazing stories. The bio pics and the inspired movies are lovable. There's are harsh stories too but they show the true things that we can correlate in our daily lives.PS: I don't wanna talk about filmy style or Bollywood action which definitely gives negative impact over society showing life is too easier on the screen. Life is never easy. ",

I will give you an example how deeply the movies go in to the hearts of people.This is a real incident that happened to me. Few days back when I was playing with kids in my neighbourhood,I lifted a 3years girl and made her stand on my shoulders.she then suddenly started singing..\"evadanta evadanta ninnu ethukundhi...\".That is a song from recent hit movie BAHUBALI.The song appears on screen when the hero lifts a huge heavy Shiva linga on his shoulders. I wondered how a girl of 3yrs could understand that,memorise and recollected.  It is how movies have impact on people especially on kids. ",

Movies also let us tell stories that cannot otherwise be told. They expand our imagination, let us see things in advance. They are the difference between reading a Star Wars Novel describing a Light Saber fight and seeing the Light Saber fight happen right in front of you. Movies record, movies tell about movement. 130 years ago, we couldn't do that at all. ",

In the case of the USA, it\u2019s mostly bad. Violence is too mainstream in Hollywood. Guess who\u2019s copycatting? Americans. We are programmed to believe and be led by entertainers as our spiritual gurus now. We\u2019re electing television stars as leaders. This is very, very dangerous. I think other cultures see movies for what they are: entertainment. But in the USA, we are brainwashed. ",
