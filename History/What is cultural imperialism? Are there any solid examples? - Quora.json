            "answer_text": "Cultural Imperialism may have many forms. As for instance when it tries more or less forcefully and subtly to impose one culture over the another one, like claiming that the Russian then Soviet culture\u2019 s literature, art, values and learning was superior to all others. By that definition a cultural imperialism may be when the long gone customs or languages are enforced, just for example Celtic in Ireland, or Purity of French language \u201cpolice\u201d in Montreal. If the foreign culture is strong and attractive and is accepted voluntary it my push out or eliminate the local one. Sometime the imperialistic culture of the nation on the whole culturally inferior but stronger may be in some aspects superior to the local one, To give hopefully non-controversial example SATI or widow burning in India was culturally inferior to the English custom of respecting and honoring wives of dead men. Russification of Poland even if brutally enforced was never fully successful, but the French manners, custom and language were accepted voluntary, even by the Russians ! Today people wear jeans all over the world and drink coca cola, and eat burgers in various versions of macdonalds.And listen to English and American music. Polish language is full of \u201canglicisms\u201d where used to be the Polish words. Everyone learns English, and people pay good money to come to Disneyland. Well, for me cultural imperialism, is the war in which stronger \u201cculture\u201d wins, stronger but not better, P.S. I wonder what kind of cultural imperialism is tattooing bodies in Maori style, putting rings in the nostrils, mutilating bodies, colouring green or pink the hair, and wearing jeans with ready made holes?

            "answer_text": "Cultural imperialism, is the imposition by one usually politically or economically dominant community of various aspects of its own culture onto another, nondominant community. It is cultural in that the customs, traditions, religion, language, social and moral norms, and other aspects of the imposing community are distinct from, though often closely related to, the economic and political systems that shape the other community. It is a form of imperialism in that the imposing community forcefully extends the authority of its way of life over the other population by either transforming or replacing aspects of the nondominant community\u2019s culture. Although the term was popularized in the 1960s, and was used by its original proponents to refer to cultural hegemonies in a post-colonial world, cultural imperialism has also been used to refer to times further in the past.
