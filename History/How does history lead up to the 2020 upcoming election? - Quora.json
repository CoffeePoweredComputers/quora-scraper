            "answer_text": "The two professions that are at the bottom of most people list are. 1. Used car salesmen. 2. Politicians. 3. If there is a third it would-be lawyers. Amazingly many politicians are lawyers. Makes sense. Our Presidents with just a few exceptions have been politicians. Many of them have never worked a job outside of politics. By the way, before I go any further. I want to apologize to Used car salesmen for putting you in that group. The 2016 election caused a seismic shift in our political landscape. The ultimate politician against a Developer/TVstar. This was supposed to be a coronation not an upset of a Biblical proportion. The world almost stopped the following day. How could the United stated do such a thing? America kicked their QUEEN to the curb. The Builder/TV star had made wild promises to his supporters. Things that could not be done. Sounded almost like a politician. Over the next 4 years, the Builder/Tv star kept every one of those promises. First, the politicians on the QUEEN\u2019S side did not like the promises he made, and to make matters worse he had kept them. Something politicians never do. Now we have another matchup in 2020. A career politician who never had another job. claiming he understands working people against the Builder/TV star. The Builder/TV star is a little battered. I do not think he ever envisioned the hatred his victory would bring him. I didn\u2019t either, from both sides of the aisle as they say. So we really have the same contest as 2016. We have a Builder/TV that still has a bounce in his step and a Career politician that has never had a real job and maybe starting to stumble a bit. This would have not been a contest if the Builder/TV star would have sold out his supporters. Thankfully he did not. So it is going to take another upset of Biblical proportions. ",
