            "answer_text": "By getting really badly hurt, I'm afraid. The earliest attempts at making something to slow down a falling person were made something like a thousand years ago. Time and time again, someone, thinking about sails and parasols and the like catching the wind, had the bright idea of taking advantage of that effect. The problems, generally speaking, is that early parachutes were too small (say, the size of a bed sheet), sometimes too heavy (lots of early designs involve rigid wooden frames), and always working from too low an altitude. There were some attempts, for example, during the Renaissance with people jumping from cathedrals and similarly high places, but that wasn't enough. The inadequate chutes didn't have enough time to really catch the air and slow the user enough to keep him from turning into a red splat on the streets of Venice and Milan. Parachutes really needed the greater altitudes which started to become available with hot-air balloons around the 19th century. They also benefited from an increased understanding of aerodynamics. For example, it wouldn't have occurred to a Renaissance-or-earlier experimenter to cut a hole in his parachute in order to increase stability. ",

[1]  Many things were tried and the modern (pack+ripcord+pilot-chute) parachute was was developed not so much because they figured out it was going to work as because having a line from the plane/balloon pull it out was not particularly safe (especially if the aircraft was spinning). The parachute was a slow, collaborative evolutionary process, not a quick theory>design>test>success \"one-man with an idea\" invention.
