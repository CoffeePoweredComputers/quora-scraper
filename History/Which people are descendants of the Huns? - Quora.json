            "answer_text": "UNITA ( the Huns ) were the royal Scythians , mentioned by Herodotus placing them in the Black Sea steppes, exactly where is the Holy Land of the Scythians, where buried their great kings. In this same area are the graves of Kubrat and Asparuh. Priscus of Panium not accidentally use the phrase royal Scythians when talking about the Huns. The old author knew very well what he was saying because he was a direct witness and has seen the Huns with his own eyes, get to know their life, their customs ... About Alans, Marcellinus says they are big people with ginger, Sable brown hair and piercing ( bright ) eyes . So far nothing strange, but chronicler adds that Alans are similar in every aspect with the Huns ... i.e. Huns are also large people Sable-brown /red/ hair. In his work dedicated to the Huns Herman Schreiber also stated that the archaeological research it is known that the Huns have surprisingly high growth ... Turk-Altai people are neither large nor Sable -brown haired. On the contrary, those people whose homeland is Central Asia is characterised by its low stature, dark skin and black, straight hair. Therefore, in terms of anthropology Huns were Caucasian, and not Mongoloid . Another important but concealed the fact is that Hun names are not typical for the peoples near the Amu Darya and Syr Darya and show kinship with those of the Thracians. Scythians and Thracians are closely related peoples living in Eastern and Southeastern Europe at least since Neolithic times . Evidence of this amazing similarities can be seen between the cultures of the Varna Necropolis ( Thrace ) and Tripoli ( Scythia ). These similarities are typical not only for the Neolithic, but also to the Bronze Age. The material culture of the Huns - their sacred boilers, ceramics, arrowheads, spears, and so on. do not appear spontaneously in the Balkans in the III-IV centuries, but are typical of the material culture of Dobrudzha, Transylvania and Black Sea steppes from the time of the Iron Age. This shows there is no significant change in the ethnic map of Eastern Europe for several thousand years. Thracians and Scythians ( later called Huns ) have almost identical funeral rituals, religion, customs, weapons, beaten, ceramics, and personal names. So a number of less popular historical sources confirm the fact that the Scythians and Thracians have a common origin. 1. Stephen Byzantine says - Scythians were a Thracian people . 2. Dion Cassius looks at things from another angle, arguing that the Thracian tribe Dacians is branch of the Scythians . 3. Strabo defines Saka as Eastern Scythians, but Aristophanes Saka were Thracians . 4. Again Strabo gives an extremely important information, namely, that in ancient times the Greeks called Scythians by the name of all nations to the north of them ... i.e. also Thracians. There's more data confirming local origin of the people seriously changed the history of Europe. At the beginning of V century Priscus visited Attila and provides valuable information in his work. Chronicler explains that the Huns lived in the town protected by a wooden fence . In this city was no yurts but wooden houses decorated with exquisite carvings and polished boards. House of Attila has two towers. They have wear linen clothes with embroidery, same as Thracian national clothes. Procopius describes the Huns hair fashion - shaving the hair and leaving the kika. Centuries ago, Plutarch attributes this custom to the Thracian tribes abbanti and moesi. An interesting attribute of the Huns clothing is the hat. Amyan Marcellin and the quoted G\u00e9za Feher tells that she has a particular shape, inclined (galeris incurvis). This type of hat is typical for Thracians and Scythians, known under the name Thracian/Phrygian hat. Jordanes gives another aspect of the funeral of Attila, namely that after the death of the nobleman, the Huns self-harm and with pain and blood they gave last respects to their ruler - 254 - There they found the death of Attila accomplished by an effusion of blood, without any wound, and the girl with downcast face weeping beneath her veil. (255) Then, as is the custom of that race, they plucked out the hair of their heads and made their faces hideous with deep wounds , that the renowned warrior might be mourned, not by effeminate wailings and tears, but by the blood of men . http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html#ostro Exactly the same custom in Scythians described by Herodotus almost a thousand years earlier - 4.71 - Then those who receive the corpse thus conveyed to them do the same as the Royal Scythians, that is they cut off a part of their ear and shave their hair round about and cut themselves all over the arms and tear their forehead and nose and pass arrows through their left hand . http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4070.htm Not only religion, toponyms hidronyms, personal names and armaments of the Scythians and Thracians are common. The similarities are many more and in different areas. Herodotus tells of Scythian custom made ritual cup of skull flattened foe. For exactly the same custom of the Thracians tells Lucius Flor. Thracian-Scythian tradition is guarded by Bulgarians to the Middle Ages when Krum Scary slash Nikifor Genik and makes from his skull a cup. Herodotus presents another interesting information, namely, that noble Thracians marked their bodies with tattoos. This information was confirmed by pictures on Greek vases. A well preserved embalmed bodies of Scythian kings became clear that the Scythians also decorated their bodies with figures of animals. In later times, this tradition ended with the adoption of Christianity. And yes, this is not Wikipedia\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Shaswata you are terribly wrong on a few accounts. The Pashtun people aren't \"hindu\". You have to remember that it is only recently that the word hindu is used for a religion. Originally it was meant to mean \"indian\" in the Bactrian and other iranian languages. The word Pakhto (which also appears as Bakhlo in Bactrian reliefs) means Bactria/Bactrian. Therefore its oximoronic to ask if a Bactrian was an indian when in fact they are two different people [its like asking when the Greeks converted over into being Germans). You yourself confirm the physical difference between Bactrians and Indians when in the beginning of when you identify the huns (who consituted one or more tribes of the Bactrians) as an iranic (rather than indic \"hindu\") people. Now lets look at the various tribes of the Bactrians who have today, come to consitute the many different clans of the modern Pakhtuns. There are the Kushano (Kushans), Kidaro (Kidarites), Khwano (Xionites/Chinoites), Sako (Scythians), Parato (Parthians), Aparytai (Afridi), Apdalo/Abdalo (Heptalites) and many more, were all various tribes who collectively constituted, or came to constitute the Bactrian (Pakhto, Bakhlo) people. They also collectively seem to have adopted the Bactrian language, which was the language of administration and remained so which is why Pakhto remains the regional language today. With the coming of Islam, some of these tribes changed their names i.e Yousofzai (Joseph's clan), Jadoon (Jaden's clan) etc, but a few retained their pre-Islamic names i.e Hapdalo, apdalo, abdali (Heptilites) and Aprutai (Afridis). The \"Yousofzai' or Yusufzai Pakhtuns likely come from the Kidaro (Kidraites) whose name seems to be a Bactrian pronounciation of \"Gandhari\" (Peshawari). The name Peshawar likely comes from the Bactrian name for Gandhara which is \"PaPesho\".  The religion of these eastern Iranian tribes consisted of animism, poltheism as well as an archaic pro-Zoroastrian pantheon of Iranic deities. Greek and Indic intruders such as Buddha (Boodo in Bactrian) and Herakles (Eraclo in Bactrain) come later, however their presence in the Bactrian pantheon is always at a fairly reduced level. As everyone knows, the Pakhtuns/Pashtuns today consitute a major people of Pakistan and Afghanistan. ",
