            "answer_text": "The word \u201cgenius\u201d has two distinct, but overlapping, meanings. It comes from Latin \u201cgenius\u201d with an original meaning of a guiding or guardian spirit that accompanies one through life. The two modern meanings, \u201cexceptional talent\u201d or \u201chigh degree of mental ability\u201d first emerge in the 1640s. All too often, in modern parlance, we reduce genius to a score on an IQ test. On that matter, the first thing one must say is that we have no way to determine what the IQ of either of them might be. It is reasonable to assume that Newton\u2019s would have been high\u2014but more important than that, he had a remarkable talent, or genius, for mathematics and physics, and an intellectual curiosity second to no one, not even Leonardo. He discovered the calculus either at the same time as, or before, Leibnitz, and made many other discoveries in mathematics. He established the basic laws of mechanics and gravitation in a form that was universal until Einstein, and which still governs most of what we see and do on a day to day basis. He was the first scientist to study optics comprehensively. He became the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge when he was only 27. He has also the Master of the Royal Mint later in his life, and, if that were not enough, also a deep student of the esoteric discipline of alchemy. He is the single most important figure in the history of physics, and, for me, the single greatest scientist in history. The same is true of Shakespeare. His talent was as a writer and as a dramatist, and few have equaled him at either, and I think none surpassed him. He defines the top rank along with a very few others\u2014for T. S. Eliot, only Dante. Can we even begin to assess his raw intellectual horsepower? I think not. The one thing Shakespeare is not is a philosophical writer, unlike many of his contemporaries, like Bacon, Jonson, or Spenser. In both cases, however, what matters is their singular achievements, not how they might rank on an arbitrary scale. ",

            "answer_text": "I will quote the short story of Isaac Asimov: \u201cThe Immortal Bard\u201d In that short story, one professor brings from the past William Shakespeare and he is enrolled to a modern literature class, without his friend, who taught that class, knowing it. What happened was that his friend flunked Shakespeare and he returned ashamed to his era. My guess is that Iq testing people from the past would not be reliable, because their way of thinking would be outdated by modern standards. Their brains would be hardwired differently. That being said, I\u2019m sure that Shakespeare and Newton were far to the right of the Bell Curve, if that Bell Curve was normalized for the people of their era. ",
