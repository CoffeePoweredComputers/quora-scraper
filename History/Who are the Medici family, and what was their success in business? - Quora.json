            "answer_text": "The Medici family are an ancient Florentine family, a protagonist of central importance in the history of Italy and Europe from the 15th to the 18th century. The Medici obtained, de facto control first of the city of Florence, and then of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Except for some short-term interruptions, the Medici power lasted from 1434, with the lordship of Cosimo the Elder, to 1737, with the death of Gian Gastone, the last Grand Duke. Besides Grand Dukes of Tuscany, other titles the family held through various generations and branches of the family included Lords and later Dukes of Florence, Dukes of Urbino and Nemours, and Princes of Ottajano. The Ottajano are the youngest and only extant branch of the family. Originally from the Mugello region, probably belonging to the small rural nobility that was inhabited starting from the 12th century, initially the activities of the Medici of the first generations concerned textile trading, agriculture and only sporadically banking. With the foundation of the Banco dei Medici, which existed between 1397 and 1494 and was the largest bank in Europe in the 15th Century, by Giovanni di Bicci, the family acquired wealth and power over time, becoming the financier of the most influential personalities in the European political panorama. The Banco, for example, financed the Pope, the conquest of the Duchy of Milan by Francesco Sforza, the victory of Edward of York in the War of the Roses, to name only a few. According to many scholars, the Medici were for a time the richest family in Europe. With the coming to power of Cosimo and his nephew Lorenzo the Magnificent, incarnation of the humanist prince, the Medici power was one of the main driving forces of the Renaissance: the lords of Florence were treated as sovereigns by the other European monarchs, and the artistic life and cultural heritage of 15th century Florence was a point of reference for all of Europe, thanks also to the tireless work of cultural promotion carried out by the Magnificent. Politically, Lorenzo took care to preserve the balance of the Italian states by safeguarding the Lega Italica promoted by his grandfather, guaranteeing Italy a long period of internal peace and development. After his death in 1492, his heirs were not as capable, contributing to plunge the Peninsula into the ruinous series of conflicts known as the Italian Wars, which marked the ever greater marginalisation of the Italian states in the Europe of the great national powers. The Medici family boasts four Popes of the Catholic Church: Pope Leo X, son of Lorenzo the Magnificent and Clarice Orsini, the last successor of Peter to be a simple deacon at the time of his election, brought to the papal court the splendor and splendor typical of the culture of Renaissance courts. On 3 January 1521 he excommunicated Martin Luther with the papal bull Decet Romanum Pontificem. Pope Clement VII, cousin of Leo X, denied a divorce to Henry VIII of England and had to undergo the Anglican Schism. During his papacy there was the Sack of Rome. Both popes were great patrons in the family tradition. The third Medici pope, Leo XI, reigned for less than a month in April 1605. The fourth Pope Pius IV was a Medici from Milan who, although modern historians have never been able find proof of any actual connection between the families of Florence and Milan, the Milanese family considered themselves to be a branch of the Florentine family and the Florentines accepted the connection as well. The family also counts two Queen Consorts of France: Caterina de 'Medici, the last direct descendant of the Magnificent, and Maria, daughter of the Grand Duke Francesco I de 'Medici and grandmother of Louis XIV, the Sun King.
