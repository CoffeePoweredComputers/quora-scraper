            "answer_text": "Henry II of England cleaned up the mess following the destructive civil war between his mother, Empress Matilda, and King Stephen. He pulled down a lot of unauthorised castles that were being used by rogue lords to oppress the populace. He also significantly reformed the law and the financial system, and through a combination of warfare and diplomacy, built an empire the size of Charlemagne\u2018s. He married the richest woman in Europe, Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was a skilled statesman in her own right. His empire didn't last; his incompetent son John lost much of it in wars with France, which was led by a young and ambitious king. But Henry was \u201can able king in an able time,\u201d intelligent, prudent, judicious, and unusually fair (considering that it was the Middle Ages). ",

            "answer_text": "Henry II was the first British sovereign to attempt to establish a new government principal that we all now take for granted The Rule of Law Henry wanted to make all of his subjects subject to both the criminal and common law courts, essentially separating the judicial system from the executive and feudal system. But it didn\u2019t work. The church in England refused to go along with the plan. About one-third of males in England were exempt from the common law and criminal courts as \u201clay ministers\u201d, essentially people who had some sort of role in the church. They answered to the ecclesiastical courts, which also controlled things like marriage, divorce and estates (and did so well into the 19th century). Things came to a head when a priest was arrested by a sheriff, tried to escape, and was killed. Henry tried to get control by arranging for his best friend, Thomas Becket, to be appointed to the post of Archbishop of Canterbury. However, Thomas sided with the church against the king, After Thomas was murdered by some drunk knights who thought they were doing Henry a solid, Henry pretty much dropped his plans and they didn\u2019t get discussed again until John became King.
