            "answer_text": "Not close at all. Some people tend to think if the Medieval society (the standard, run of the mill, feudal model, which should be separately debunked) as highly hierarchical, while it wasn\u2019t hierarchical at all. It was fractal.  Let me explain this. In a hierarchical society, each and every person has a role and a position, a ranking, but is subject to all of the above ranks. If you are a peasant, you are not just responsible to your village headman, you are also responsible to the local strong man, to the big feudal lord, and finally to the king. This is a type of structure that we should instead associate with later societies: in absolutist France (and we are talking about the Modern Age, about Nouveau R\u00e9gime) the king was indeed everyone\u2019s lord. Whatever he ordered, in other words, the others did. This is associated with strong, unified states, with centralized control and power that acts through a ramified bureaucracy of civil servants. But Medieval, feudal societies didn\u2019t work like that. They lacked the coherence to do so. Power was extremely localized, owned and controlled by the local lord. It was also attributed to certain people based on a \u201cfirst among the equal\u201d basis pretty often. A Medieval peasant lived in a village which had a headman. The headman referred to the local strong man (not necessarily a \u201clord\u201d, who referred to the local small feudatary, who referred to the regional feudatory, who referred to the king. The headman was, though, kind of chosen by the village: he may have been elected, or otherwise selected, or he may be the most literate or the richest. But if you thought you would make a better headman than him, you could try and oust him. He was the one to deal personally with the local strong man. Now, the local strong man wasn\u00ect usually a primus inter pares: often enough the whole upper tier had a sort of cesure with the peasants and artisans, which dated back to the old migrations of the Late Antiquity, so this upper tier often even had a completely different ethnic origin. Even if the local strong man didn\u2019t actually have a noble\u2019s title (or had a very junior one) he was of a different stock. The local peasant often saw the local strong man as he would visit the villages from time to time, mainly to solve disputes, or they visited him at his tower/castle/manor to get disputes solved. Now, minor disputes were solved by the local headmen, but the bigger ones (think actual crimes or those involving riches or the control over big chunks of land, or disputes between villages, or also disputes that involved the local headman) were arbitrated by the local strong man, supposedly not according to his whims but rather according to the law. The local strong man was in turn subject to the local small feudatary. This was again a primus inter pares, sort of elected or picked by the local strong men. They would treat the small feudatary as an almost equal, and the feudatary would treat his local strong men as cherished friends, but still be guarded when they were around because, alas, they could oust him and pick a new strong man of the strong men. Yet, this new strong man needed to be recognized as such by the regional feudatary to have any legitimacy. Hence conflicts. But the situation was far from being written in stone, and the regional feudatary would also be able to cause a local feudatary to become disgraced and ultimately lose his power just by disregarding him. Unless he had enough support from the other local feudataries and also by his strong men. In the end, power relationships were extremely dynamic. The same overall scheme of things regulated the relationship of the king with his regional feudataries. So, back to our little peasant. He deals daily with the headman. He sees quite regularly (a few times a year, probably) the local strong man. The headman sees the local strong man far more often, though. Occasionally the humble peasant may see the cortege of the local feudatary filing past as he visited the local strong man or went by minding his own business. The headman may be invited to meet the local feudatary on some special occasions, maybe once a year. The local strong man would meet the local feudatary pretty often, and occasionally meet the regional feudatary, but would only see the king occasionally and usually from a distance, etc. Now, the interesting thing is that the peasant had no direct allegiance to the king. Theoretically, if the king happened to meet a peasant, he would not be able to order him about, or rather the peasant may answer the king \u201cI am lord\u2019s So-and-so man, not your man, so you can\u2019t boss me around\u201d. Not that they ever dared to do it, but still if the king ordered something, the peasant only had to fulfill the order with the headman or the local strong man assent. The local strong man, in turn, didn\u2019t receive orders from the king, he received orders from the small feudatary who received orders from his regional feudatary, who received orders from the king. If a feudatary decided to rebel and try to oust his superior, the local strong man was supposed to follow his local feudatary in rebelling, has he had no allegiance to the king or to the regional feudatary. It was a fractal, no a hierarchy. Besides, not all peasants were fitted into this fractal system. Some had a monastery or even a nunnery as their local strong people. In this case, the religious institution was supposed to be an emanation of the church, obedient to the local bishop, who in turn was supposed to be obedient to the Pope. This was a largely independent (not really, sometimes the two fused, but let\u2019s not get into too many details), but still kind of fractal system. Indeed the Church was much more unified and the pope did have some power over its whole structure, but the distances and the lack of media made sure that this unified stricture was far less coherent than we consider normal. And in the later Middle Ages, the free cities appeared. Free cities had a complicated relationship with the kings. Sometimes they were totally independent, sometimes they had a loose tie with the king or with a regional feudatary. Cities didn\u2019t exist in a void, they actually had control over some parts of the countryside that produced food for the use of the city. So, as a peasant, you may be actually tied not to a local strong man, etc, but rather to a city at which head there was an elected functionary. So, not only the common peasant basically never had the occasion to lay his eyes on the king. The common peasant didn\u2019t really serve the king, wasn\u2019t tied by any allegiance to the king himself, and often didn\u2019t even belong to a fractal structure of power that ended with a king.

            "answer_text": "While vastly exaggerated for comic effect, the Monty Python \u2018s Holy Grail version comes to mind: \u2018Ooh look, it's the king.\u2019 \u2018How do you know it's the king?\u2019 \u2018Cos \u2018ee's the only one not covered in shit.\u2019 I think it neatly conveys the notion that the king - or a king - would be an exotic creature to any given peasant, far more so than a unicorn or - in modern terms - a real-life honest-to-god space alien. In all likelihood a king wouldn't just show up unannounced, or minus his retinue. He'd be surrounded even if out hunting, the focus of a small but impressive personal protection detail plus favoured courtiers, whoever carried his water, wine, bread, meat and cheese to say nothing of snacks and nibbles. Add in reserve archers, dispatch riders, a clerk - probably also a clergyman - the local landowner kept at a safe distance unless a relative, or client, effectively a hostage in his own backyard just in case - and this isn't a king paying a social call, it's more like an invasion. If the king deigned to acknowledge the existance of a peasant, in all probability he'd be summoned, and not gently, by a man at arms and if not hurled to the mud then intimidated in a desultory way in case he said or did anything stupid. If he was lucky, the peasant might get a gracious wave and someone low in the retinue order of peck might hand over a small silver coin (that the local landowner would have off his peasant the moment there were no witnesses), or if it was a gold coin whenever the peasant's wife, mother or daughter stopped weeping, but in this case the peasant might get to keep a few coppers. Forget King Arthur, forget Richard the Lionheart, think Bad King John in a Robin Hood movie. Better yet, look for The War Lord. A 1965 movie starring Charlton Heston that depicts a more than usually gritty unglamorous version of knightly interactions with the peasants who were generally regarded as little better than the beasts such a lord hunted in his Demesne. Bottom line, forget Camelot, think Game of Thrones. ",
