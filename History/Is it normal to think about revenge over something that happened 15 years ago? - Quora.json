            "answer_text": "Quite simply no. I think you should try to seek some help to allow you to work out what is going on and leave it behind. The reason I say this is because it is probably not affecting the other person, so you hold on to it and it makes you stuck in the era of 15 years ago in many respects. I always say, Revenge invites more revenge which is never good. But only justice allows for a situation to have closure. For the people who have committed any wrong against me, I let it go and then just know that at some point they will face the situation somehow, someway and I will have moved far beyond. Never give them a second of your precious energy. They never cared about you to not do the action, why should you care about them enough to waste your thoughts and time in such a way? Good luck with everything. ",

Part of me says: Although if you get a chance, do go for it\u2026 Just don't go too\u200b far just far enough to warn him, well the other part of me tell you to forgive, but not forget; because if you forgive and forget people will make a fool out of you and treat you like an object\u2026 You wouldn't like that, now would you.
