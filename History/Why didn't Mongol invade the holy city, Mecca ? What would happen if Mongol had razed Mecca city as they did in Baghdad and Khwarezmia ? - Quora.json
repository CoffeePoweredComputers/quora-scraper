            "answer_text": "the reason the Mongols didn\u2019t attack Mecca is they ran out of time. given enough time and resources the Mongols would have likely attacked Mecca and Iceland as well. you are talking about a group who were among history\u2019s worst imperialist aggressors. the whole Mongol \u201cempire\u201d was a predatory and parasitic enterprise from the start. there was no grand political vision! no dream of setting up sustainable communities across Eurasia. the Mongols were engaged in their aggression for no other reason than for loot. they had no interest in their subjugated populations except as a source of revenue. they had nothing to offer people but extermination or subjugation. i totally agree with Professor C P Fitzgerald. \u201cthe Mongols were the pre-industrial equivalent of atomic war. They destroyed flourishing cities and regions.\u201d areas that were spared the Mongol holocaust like India or Germany escaped by having the good fortune of competent political and military forces or having the clock run out on Mongol capabilities for expansion. no telling how the destruction of Mecca would have impacted Islam. it certainly would not have been a positive development.

            "answer_text": "A couple of reasons. One of the more obvious ones is that they didn\u2019t even get close. Mongol expansion was stopped in the Levant, something like 700 miles away from Mecca, and mostly through desert, which would have been a significant logistical challenge. Attacking Mecca simply was no more an option than attacking Constantinople or Rome. Just as importantly, they didn\u2019t have much of a reason to march on Mecca. They would have taken it over if they\u2019d gotten that far, but Mecca wasn\u2019t nearly as significant politically or economically as, say, Baghdad or Cairo. It has unparalleled importance spiritually, but the Mongols were religiously pluralistic and had no interest in attacking Muslims per se or the religion of Islam. They just wanted political hegemony and economic benefits. ",
