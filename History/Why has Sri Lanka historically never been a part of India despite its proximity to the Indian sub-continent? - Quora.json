            "answer_text": "Although Sri Lanka emerged as a separate country, it would not be completely correct to state that Sri Lanka was never the part of India. Right from the time of Ramayana, Sri Lanka finds mention in Indian texts. If you turn the pages of history, you would find that Sri Lanka was being conquered by the South Indian kings. Connection with India: According to Mahavamsa, a Sri Lankan text, it is believed that Prince Vijaya, who belonged to the kingdom of Kalinga was banished from his kingdom. During his exile, he landed in this island with his followers. Eventually he married a local girl and their children gave rise to the Pulinda race. Also, he married the princess of the Pandu kingdom and his followers married the maidens of the princess sent by the king. Their offspring gave rise to the Sinhalese people. Prince Vijaya is credited with the establishment of the Tambapanni kingdom. This period was followed by Anuradhapura period. Conquest of the Island Nation: There were multiple times when the island nation of Sri Lanka was invaded and conquered by South Indian kings. The Five Dravidians: Believed to be from the Pandyan kingdom, five Tamil chiefs overthrew the local king and ruled the kingdom for a span of 14 years after which they were defeated and the reign returned to the local king.The Cholas: Raja Raja Chola and Rajendra Chola also conquered the island kingdom and ruled over it for a span of 80 years after which they were defeated by the Sinhalese king. There were numerous battle between the Cholas and the rulers of Anuradhapura.Aryacakravarti dynasty: One of the major dynasties of Sri Lanka, Aryacakravarti dynasty, was set up by the Pandyans when they captured and established a kingdom, known as Jaffna kingdom. This dynasty went on to rule the kingdom for centuries to come and is recorded as one of the major dynasties in that era.British India and Ceylon: Ceylon was initially a Portuguese who were succeeded by the Dutch. Later, British overthrew the Dutch and took over the island. It became a new colony of the crown. India continued to be ruled by East India Company while Ceylon became the colony of the crown. However, India and Ceylon, although became part of the same crown later, were never merged. Reason could be either that natives of both the nations were different culturally, Ceylon was not as profitable as India or could be both. India and Sri Lanka have been sharing ties since ancient times. We could see some Indian influence on their culture as well. Although, Sri Lanka and India parted ways from the advent of British Raj, prior to that as history suggests, Sri Lanka did become an \u201cextended\u201d part of India for a considerable time.

            "answer_text": "It was because - it was kept separate by British as they did for all other states within India but the then newly formed United Indian Govt. ensured that they forcibly made everyone to accede to the Great Union but didn\u2019t pay much attention to Srilanka or Nepal or Bhutan to be part of India. I don\u2019t know, where it worked really well to forcibly make Hyderabad and other troubling princely states to be part of the Union without question why the same force or even dialogues weren\u2019t started to make these geographically integrated regions to be part of the Indian Union. Even after years of Union forces were used in Goa and a little differently in Bastar state to make them fully integrated part of the Indian Union why much importance wasn\u2019t given or even talks weren\u2019t started to make Geographically connected states like Bhutan, Srilanka & Nepal to be part of the Union of India. To answer this the Ghost of Sardar Patel himself has to come I believe, because according to the rumours he was spear-heading the accession movement then. May be he didn\u2019t like them - ha ha ha! To Add up to the cultural aspect: Last King of Kandy:  We personally knew the last rulers of Kandy (Kandy is Most of Srilanka, there were other states within that island too and they were separate as well) and their Chennai house is still at Egmore, we called it The Kandy House and it was built in Srilankan style which still stands when I visited last year. Now Wickrama Singha\u2019s tomb is at Vellore and his direct descendants live and work there at the Vellore city. The Sinhalese people are none but born/mix of Bengali & Pandyan Origin who spread across to the Island and later the last in the line of throne to Madurai Kingdom Bangaru Thirumala deva & his brother Narenappa Nayudu after the sad demise of the queen mother Meenakshi Devi (she was badly betrayed by Chanda Sahib - son-in-law of Arcot Nawab - that\u2019s a different event in history) retreated to Kallakurichi bastion/fort under the protection of Sethupathy people where they felt they lost the legacy to an invading force\u2019s betrayal and lost the will to live, but all of a sudden their only daughter Meenakshi (named after the queen mother) got an alliance proposal from the Sinhala King of that time because he was suggested by his court astrologers to marry a bride from Suryavanshi (solar) dynasty and Bangaru Thirumala immediately accepted the proposal and got her married off to the Sinhalan king because he thought that atleast their children could live a better life and avenge and she went to live in Kandy. Later she purposefully didn\u2019t give birth to a legitimate heir to the Sinhalan throne -as the rumour has it, just because she can make her younger brother Ramasamy/Kannasamy Nayudu as the King of Sinhalan Throne and she eventually was successful and made him the King and given the name Wickrama Singha and his descendants were also called the same. He was captured by British and put on house arrest at Vellore Fortress following a defeat and he died there leaving issues. Maha Vamso - accounted history of SriLanka narrates their cultural, social, economical and origin ties with the Main land of Indian Subcontinent.
