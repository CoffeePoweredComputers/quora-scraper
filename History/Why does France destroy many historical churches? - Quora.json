            "answer_text": "Pure propaganda !  This is the chapel of Saint-Martin in Sabl\u00e9-sur-Sarthe that one can see in the video. It was built between 1880 and 1886 by the architect Ernest Rodier. Poorly maintained by the commune, it threatened to fall into ruin. The cult was no longer celebrated since the late 1970s. It was desacralized and disused in 2015. Its demolition was announced in his campaign program by Mayor Marc Joulaud so it was not against the will of the inhabitants. To compare the chapel of Sabl\u00e9 to Notre-Dame or the Cathedral of Chartres by saying it\u2019s a historical church is not only a lie but it is above all a far right propaganda enterprise to make believe that these churches are replaced by mosques. Churches have always been destroyed in France: during the Hundred Years war, hundred of churches were destroyed by the English. During the wars of religion in the sixteenth century a huge number of Catholic churches were burnt by Protestants. During the first and second World Wars, there were also hundred of churches destroyed by the German bombings but also by the ones of the Allies.  Saint-Etienne-le-Vieux near Caen. This church is dating back to the 10th century. Already damaged during the Franco-English wars of the 14th and 15th centuries, it was destroyed in 1944. When a church is now destroyed in France, it is simply because it does not offer sufficient historical interest to be preserved. There are tens of thousands of churches in France (71,217 religious buildings have been identified so far but there are still some forgotten) some of which are more than a thousand years old, but empty, others are only half a century old but still visited by many\u2026  Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre, oldest church in Paris.  Notre-Dame-du-Haut in Ronchamp. Built in 1955 by Le Corbusier Please don\u2019t make amalgams! PS: if you are interested in this matter, there is a Observatory of the Religious Heritage (in French) which publishes information on the destroyed churches (around 5 to 10 per year on average). Observatoire du patrimoine religieux Edit: I forgot to tell you that new churches are still built in France. Like the new Russian orthodox church of Paris :  To be precise and according to the Conf\u00e9rence des \u00e9v\u00eaques de France (Bishops council of France), 664 new churches have been built since 1965  Cathedral of Evry, near Paris.

            "answer_text": "France has a huge number of churches throughout its cities, towns and villages. To most they represent their heritage, architectural history and iconic of civic pride. However fewer and fewer people in France use them as places of Christian worship. As such many of these churches do not have a congregation to support its upkeep and there are increasingly becoming derelict. Whilst a church may be pulled down on occasion due to structural or financial reasons, the French don't habitually demolish them in any great number. Nonetheless, there has been recent debates in the country, particularly since the refugee crisis, about converting churches into refugee housing centres or even mosques. France is officially a secular nation, therefore it might be easy to think that they would readily reduce the religious footprint in the nation but that would be wrong and ignores the significant role faith and the church has and continues to play in the country.
