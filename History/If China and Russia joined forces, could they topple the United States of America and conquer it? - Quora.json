            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. This is a really difficult question to answer because the entanglement of alliances around the world by the US is specifically designed so that it wouldn\u2019t have to fight alone against other great powers. There is one *technically* plausible way for NATO to not be involved in an US war against Russia and China however. Perhaps special counsel Mueller will find enough collusion evidence and decides to indict Trump and as a consequence his support base begins to turn on him. Trump, ever the rational human being, then orders preemptive, conventional military strikes against China and Russia before tweeting \u201cI\u2019m being tough on China AND I\u2019m attacking Russia so I can\u2019t possibly be colluding with Putin! Fake news!\u201d NATO can then choose to stay out of the war because it is a defensive alliance meaning that if one member nation decides to fire the first shot, all others are not obligated to defend it. Now that the US stands alone, I can move on to the actual war scenarios. Russia and China, how can they defeat the US through conventional methods? Personally, I\u2019m not sure if it is possible. The US navy maintains 11 carrier battle groups as a rule, with each of them armed with sophisticated anti-submarine and air-air capabilities. Russia\u2019s surface fleet is extremely limited (having been neglected since the end of the Cold War) and while it does have a large submarine fleet, they are considered to be somewhat outclassed by the US Seawolf/Virginia classes. When it comes to China, even though it has been spending heavily on modernizing its naval force in recent years, it is still a work in progress until 2030 at the earliest. As things stand currently, it has one outdated refurbished carrier (Liaoning) more suited to be a trainer and another larger/better one (Shandong) that is undergoing sea trials as we speak thus not quite combat ready yet. Now even if China does currently posses nuclear powered carriers capable of long endurance missions, such as the proposed Type 004, it still needs supporting warships to protect it. The Type 055 destroyer is very modern and has the capabilities to rival the US Arleigh Burke class but only one has been built so far which is to say not nearly enough. As for submarines, the Type 091 and 093 nuclear submarines are not as quiet as their US counterparts and even though the Type 095 has supposedly significantly reduced its acoustic signature, it is not due to enter service until 2019\u20132020. In other words, the Chinese navy isn\u2019t capable of fighting even half of the US navy on equal footing in the near future. Now why does any of the above matter? Because unless Russia and China can neutralize or at least contain the bulk of US naval forces, it cannot even begin to dream of launching a massed assault on the US mainland to force a capitulation. Invading through Alaska is pointless because Canada isn\u2019t in the war thus it cannot be an invasion route to the lower 48 states. Then there is also the fact that logistics is an important component in any large scale, sustained war and currently China and Russia simply do not have the logistical capability to send millions of troops across two massive oceans and thousands of miles to attack the US mainland. United States, how can it defeat Russia and China simultaneously through conventional methods? Again, I\u2019m not sure if it is possible. Despite the aforementioned naval superiority US holds over China and Russia, it does not hold a domineering technological superiority. China and Russia have made developing advanced anti-air missiles, cruise missiles and conventional ballistic missiles a high priority in recent years. China in particular has developed the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile and the YJ-12 radar-avoiding, supersonic cruise missile, a version of the Russian Yakhont cruise missile. Of course western observers often times doubt the full capabilities of these weapons but Pentagon is certainly taking the threat seriously enough to order Boeing to find ways to increase the range of its fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. If Russia and China manages to sink just one or two US super carriers, it will make the Pentagon think twice regarding sending in the rest too close to shore, thus limiting their air wings combat radius and thus effectiveness. The threat to US warships isn\u2019t the only concern. Even though the US has the logistical capability to ferry hundreds of thousands combat troops to distant shores, it cannot do so if it is unable establish air superiority over the target coasts. While China may have a difficult time dealing with the F-22\u2019s, it has made the conscious choice of going the area denial route instead. Take the J-20 program for example, it was never meant to be a dog fighter to combat the F-22 or even F-35 in air superiority battles. Rather it was designed to take out the non-stealthy and more vulnerable AWACs and aerial tanker fleet that the US fields to help the F-22 and F-35 reach their full potential. The development of the PL-15 BVRAAM is the perfect example of the above goal as it out-ranges any beyond visual range missile the US currently has in its arsenal, such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM. As for Russia, while it doesn\u2019t have any J-20 styled long-range stealthy strike air crafts or DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missiles, it does have quite possibly the most sophisticated anti-air defense system in the world. The S-400 long range missile system combined with the Pantsir-S1 short/medium range artillery/missile system is enough to give any modern air force fits, including the US since the vast majority of its air fleet is still non-stealthy. There are still lingering doubts regarding just how stealthy F-35 is against modern AESA radars that China and Russia fields but I digress. Just try to conduct a large scale amphibious landing on hostile coasts without reliable and persistent air cover. Ugly doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. Even if the US manages to gain a foothold by landing 100-200k troops in both of China and Russia, it will still be at a massive manpower and equipment disadvantage that even a 10 to 1 casualty ratio would not be able to make up for. In short, the likelihood of US being able to take and hold significant chunks of Russian and Chinese territories is extremely unlikely. Bottom line, a conventional war between Russia and China against the US will likely become a lengthy and bloody stalemate. So how can one side win against the another? Nuclear weapons? Between the 14100 nuclear weapons these three countries hold and despite the fact that there are doubts whether that many nukes can in fact incinerate every habitable corner of the planet (it probably can\u2019t), consider the following urbanization rates: US: 82%Russia: 73%China: 60% Even if a large portion of the urban population do not die in the initial strike, there\u2019s always the subsequent lethal radiation fallout/sickness, famine and social breakdown to consider. I doubt losing 70\u201380% of the population can be constituted as a \u201cvictory\u201d for any of the three countries involved. ",

            "answer_text": "China and Russia can not defeat the USA but neither can the USA defeat both of them simultaneously without the aid of NATO and crucially, Japan, Australia, and the Middle East, both militarily and economic aid. As mentioned in the other answers, an attack on a NATO member would be an attack against all its members, sparking another great world war. However, if the USA attacked first, then it is highly unlikely that NATO would be activated due to there being no legal obligation, as can be seen with Iraq. Yet, even with NATO a war would only lead to a stalemate and total exhaustion on both sides. Russia can match the military capabilities of its European counterparts and obtain significant aid from China to maintain such a conflict on its border. China on the other hand is developing and soon will achieve, if not already achieved, similar military capabilities. With China's economy currently the world's largest in terms of Purchasing Power Parity, it can already invest in a military sufficiently capable to win a one-on-one conflict versus the USA. Such a military could be ready for such a conflict in the next 15 - 20 years. A war now would leave both countries exhausted but mainly caught in the Western Pacific. A war when China has a conpletely modern military with a deeper and more broader \"blue\" navy would be fought throughout the entirety of the Pacific, with nations such as Japan, Australia, and the Middle East being crucial in offsetting the greater power China would otherwise have. Ultimately, a direct war would lead to a world war and these countries, having hopefully learned their lessons as participants in the last world war, would never contemplate reigniting such a conflict in an age of nuclear weapons. It could lead to mutually assured total annihilation. More likely, the conflict will be another Cold War fought economically and through proxy nations without triggering NATO obligations or a call for aid from non-NATO allies.  A Cold War would lead to significant long term economic damage but less tangible than a Great War and again, without any winners. It could be argued that even America did not benefit from the Cold War as the proxy wars and espionage etc did not aid in the ending of the war but Gorbachev and his visits to a more open and successful prospering economy led Russia to choose a better path.  Yet, through the conflicts and concerns America has had with Russia, it has managed only a stale mate by buying off China's neutrality by not enforcing it's norms on China.  This has continued to this day with China as a consequence, managing to work for the most part outside the World Trade Organization's restrictions while benefiting from its membership in such a way that non-Chinese companies lose their economic capability to the Chinese state backed enterprises. Without America able to sustain it's economic advantage in light of China'a rise due to its lack of adherence to international norms, it will no longer be willing to not challenge China in the WTO and other international bodies. China will therefore have no incentive to sit out a Cold War between Russia and America while NATO and other American ally states would probably be less proactive. The conclusion of such a war could be that America loses but not without considerable cost to China. If America's allies do participate as committedly as the USA would, then such a war could be a loss for Russia and China but not without considerable cost to their own economies. The answer in short seems that American can be defeated but unlikely with its allies unless it is seen as the aggressor. More likely, Russia and China would be defeated. ",
