            "answer_text": "Yes. At various levels and moments in time. If Fidel Castro had not destroyed the anti-Batista revolution and if he had not installed a new dictatorship there would have been no US - Cuba problem and mere Soviet Cuban standard diplomatic relations. The best solution.If Eisenhower and / or Kennedy had endorsed Fidel Castro as the new Cuban \u201ccaudillo\u201d he would never have sided with the Soviet Union and no \u201cnuclear shield\u201d for Cuba or a \u201cisland nuclear base\u201d would have existed for the Soviet Union. A bad solution for the Cuban people, but a removal of threat for the USA.If Eisenhower / Kennedy has supported the Escambray revolt and had more actively supported the Cuban anti-Castro rebellion he may have fallen and a new democracy could have arisen in Cuba. The second best solution for Cuba. Note though that fear of the Escambray rebellion and the need for cash and arms pushed Castro closer to the Soviet Union.If Khrushchev had realized earlier what an untrustworthy megalomaniac Fidel Castro was he would never have moved nuclear weapons to Cuba even if it could give him some strategic advantage. In the end he had his foreign minister lie to Fidel to remove all weapons. Castro\u2019s letter demanded a first strike on the US made Khrushchev call Castro a \u201cmadman\u201d according to his son.In short: no Castro, no missile crisis. Endorsement by the US of Castro (which Fidel sought) might have also avoided it. The reason for the crisis was the fear of Castro of the US and his desire to remain in power even at the cost of millions of lives. ",

Had President Kennedy followed thru with the Eisenhower administration\u2019s plan for the Bay of Pigs invasion and not abandoned the members of the Brigade 2506 to their luck once the initial beach head objective had been achieved, he wouldn't have had to deal with Castro and the soviets placing nuclear missiles in Cuba a year later. I bet that must have been one of the decisions Kennedy regretted until his untimely death\u2026 ",
