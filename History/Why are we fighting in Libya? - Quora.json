            "answer_text": "British Prime Minister David Cameron's notable public statement: \u201cWe must not tolerate this regime using military force against its own people\u201d, was just one of many sound bites heard from US and UK politicians as they worked with NATO to take out the Gaddafi regime under the guise of a \u201chumanitarian mandate\u201d. The mainstream media describes the Libyan Revolution as an organic rebellion originating from an opposing group of citizens, often categorizing the event as part of the mass protests and revolutions now known as the \u201cArab Spring\u201d uprisings that effected Tunisia, Egypt and many others. However, a closer look at the rapid dethroning of the Gaddafi regime starts to take a different picture \u2013 a picture all too familiar to those who have had the sad fortune of following the history of covert warfare coming from Western powers and their economic interests. A History LessonIn the past 70 years, the idea of using the facade of civil uprisings to execute Geo-Economic/Politic reformations favorable to Western economic interests has become increasingly more common. We know this not only because of the now declassified CIA documents that boast of such measures - such as the overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian leader Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 which returned commercial power to Western oil interests as a response to the unwanted nationalization of Iranian oil fields by Mosaddegh prior - we also have the testimony of whistleblowers, such as famed \u201cEconomic Hit Man\u201d John Perkins, who has admitted in great detail as to his involvement in such affairs in Latin America.Another little known yet declassified example of a CIA sponsored overthrow for corporate and financial interests was the 1954 coup d'\u00e9tat that ousted President Jacobo \u00c1rbenz Guzm\u00e1n of Guatemala. The United States engineered this for the benefit of the United Fruit Company which had been lobbying the CIA to oust reformist governments in the Republic of Guatemala for years prior to secure its commercial interests. Similar CIA behavior can also be linked in one variation or another to the overthrows and/or assassinations of Ecuador's Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera in 1981 due to energy interests; Panama's Omar Torrijos also in 1981, due to conflicts over the Panama Canal (a key conduit for international maritime trade), along with perhaps the most interesting recent example - the failed 2002 coup d'\u00e9tat against President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela.As detailed by journalist Eva Golinger who obtained top-secret documents from the CIA and State Department through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the United States' Bush administration had prior knowledge of and was complicit in the 2002 coup against President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and had apparently provided over $30 million in funding aid to opposition groups to help execute the public uprising against him. Why? Oil Interests.Not to say it is a new thing for CIA to covertly arm rebel forces in other countries as they try to remove the power structure, as can be exemplified from Afghanistan to Cuba to Iraq to Argentina to Honduras to many, many other cases \u2013 but the recipe for the covert war that doesn't cause public outcry within the invading nation, without serious military commitment, is a special circumstance.The basic requirement is an initial, ideally organic public rebellion. From there, the task is to fuel the conflict and escalate destabilization which serves as a cover for covert moves. Public perception can be exploited with the conflict artificially magnified by the media. Then, some type of knee-jerk accusation that draws public sympathy is needed to generate acute disdain for the targeted parties and enable follow through.For example, before the 1991 invasion of Iraq, a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl gave public testimony stating she watched Iraqi soldiers \u201ccome into the hospital with guns and go into the room where...babies were in incubators. They took the babies out of the incubators, took the incubators, and left the babies on the cold floor to die.\u201d This testimony was repeated as fact in further Congressional Testimony, on TV and radio shows, at the UN Security Council and even by then President George H.W. Bush. It had a clearly relevant effect on public opinion and support for the 1991 invasion. However, what was not discussed, was that this 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl was a member of the Kuwaiti Royal Family. Her father was Saud Nasir al-Sabah, Kuwait's Ambassador to the USA and her entire testimony was a lie. Again, this is public record. Libya DecodedSo what is the story with Libya? Does it fit any of these profiles? Were the US & UK simply being good parents and working to altruistically protect humanity from some rouge tyrant or is there something else going on? Is there evidence to show they were complicit in the uprising, exploiting mass sympathy by some event, while holding deep ulterior motives to serve their financial and political interests? Yes. In fact, the event appears to be just about as textbook as the case was with Mosaddegh in 1954 and Chavez in 2002.First, let's start with the state of affairs. If you are like most Westerners, you have likely never met anyone from Libya nor do you know anything about it other than that odd looking man with the funky sunglasses who had been in charge for 40 some years. The idea of autocratic rule is deeply opposed in the West and perhaps that is a legitimate concern given the patterns of history in general. However, let's leave our ideologies aside and ask about the relative state of the culture before the uprising and invasion.In 2010, Libya ranked 53rd on the Human Development Index (out of 170 U.N. member states), making it a \u201chigh human development\u201d country. The U.N. Development Program said Libya had \u201chigh human development\u201d in every major index category, including education, empowerment, economy and infrastructure, access to information, civic and community well being, and gender inequality. In a 2005 Country Profile report by the Library of Congress\u2019 Federal Research Division, it noted: \u201cIn comparison to other states in the Middle East, the health status of the population is relatively good. Childhood immunization is almost universal. The clean water supply has increased, and sanitation has been improved.\u201dAs far as accusations of terrorism or weapons of mass destruction, it also stated: \u201cDuring the period 1999\u20132003, Qadhafi, ever the pragmatist, eventually fulfilled all the terms of the UN Security Council Resolutions required to lift the sanctions against Libya. He accepted responsibility for the actions of his officials and agreed to provide financial compensation to the families of the victims of Pan Am 103. As a result, the UN sanctions were lifted on September 12, 2003. In December 2003, Qadhafi publicly announced that Libya was ridding itself of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile development programs, and fully cooperated with the United States, the United Kingdom, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Through these actions and decisions, Qadhafi brought Libya back into the world community.\u201dAny general research on Libya shows that it was improving and stable and while accusations of social oppression and misdeeds might hold true on some level, as with many countries in that region, we need to be honest with ourselves and consider the realistic nature of the circumstance in comparison. If we were to examine all the oppressive regimes the United States and United Kingdom coexist with without objection, Libya was far from the worst and it wasn't until the 2011 uprising that the accusation of Libya using force against its own citizens become a heated claim for intervention.If the Western powers cared about the humanitarian crisis in Africa or the Middle-East, both general and oppressive, forces would have taken control of the Sudan long ago, where the genocide and barbarian abuses are almost beyond comprehension, not to mention intervene to end the virtual prison still existing in the West Bank due to the illegal, US sponsored Israeli occupation. This list could go on and on and the bottom line is that the very idea that the West \u201ccares\u201d about the citizenry of any such country to inspire such intervention is enormously naive and completely ignorant of history.The central \u201cwar crime\u201d accusation itself, which gives the appearance that Gaddafi forces just decided to start killing civilian protestors for fun, is void of its true context, which was a response to an armed conflict from rebel forces. Does this justify the death of human beings? Of course not but this is an issue of circumstance. If an armed militia began to make its way towards the White House, do you have any doubt that once the first shot was fired, the Police, Military and Secret Service would not hesitate to shoot anyone in their line of fire under such pressure? Again, this justifies nothing in and of itself but such is the nature of circumstance in the discordant, power sick zeitgeist we share today and the \u201cCrimes Against Humanity\u201d charges being propagated around the now fallen regime needs a much closer examination.The central charge against Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who actually didn't hold any political office, is this claim of \u201ccivilian murder\u201d, which appears as an act of defense, not cold blooded execution that would define a \u201cwar crime\u201d. It is estimated that the United States and its allies are responsible for \u00be to a million civilian deaths in Iraq and likely 10s of thousands more during the prior UN sanctions that crippled the nation for many years prior - yet we see no one on trial here. Let\u2019s also not discount the score of civilian deaths achieved by NATO as it bombed Libya for months. Currency WarsHave you ever wondered how the United States can operate with 16 trillion dollars in debt and growing? It has the Global Reserve Currency. Of all the Macro Economic factors that favor Western domination in the world today, the fact the Euro and the US Dollar are used for not only the majority of oil transactions, which in many ways serves as the virtual \u201cbacking\u201d of these fiat currencies, many other major goods are priced in Dollars and Euros, requiring most nations to purchase these currencies in order to engage in global trade, maintaining demand.In fact, approximately two thirds of world trade is done in dollars and two thirds of central banks' currency reserves are held in the American currency, which remains the sole currency used by global institutions such as the IMF. This gives the US a major economic advantage as they have the ability to run a constant trade deficit because foreign countries need those dollars to repay their debts to the IMF; to conduct international trade and to build up their currency reserves. As long as the dollar remains the main international currency, the US can continue consuming more than it produces, as it has been doing for decades now.Well, guess what? Muammar Gaddafi had been openly advocating the creation of a new currency that would counter the dollar and the euro. He called upon African and Muslim nations to join an alliance that would make this new currency, the \u201cGold Dinar\u201d, their main currency. They would sell oil and other resources to the US and the rest of the world only for gold dinars. If this were to happen, it would have had dramatic effects on US economic hegemony. In fact, some might remember that Saddam Hussein was pushing for a similar petrodollar shift before the 2003 US Invasion. This is a very serious yet little discussed reality.That noted, we shouldn't dismiss the energy interests even though they may be secondary in importance. The National Oil Corporation, Libya\u2019s nationalized oil company, was ranked 25 among the world's Top 100 oil companies and while its reserves might be minor compared to the reserves of Saudi Arabia, the liberating of previously off-limit business contracts is clearly a positive for the West. NATO InterventionThe Libyan \u201crebel\u201d forces that took to the street in February 2011 were depicted by the media and Western political commentary as an unexpected organic uprising mirroring the Arab Spring revolts nearby. Yet, a closer examination reveals a deep premeditation and clear connection to CIA involvement. Former Gaddafi army commander, Khalifa Haftar, who had been living in exile for 20 years essentially next to CIA headquarters in Virginia, with tremendous evidence to indicate ties to the agency, was quickly brought to Libya after the uprising and put into position as commander for the rebel forces. How convenient.All that was left was a trigger for intervention and it wasn\u2019t long before Libya fought back against what could very well have been a mercenary group set in motion to enable a larger mobilization against Gaddafi. This violence was quickly emphasized and set the stage for the so called \u201cHumanitarian Intervention\u201d less than 2 weeks after with \u201cResolution 1973\u201d from the UN Security Council. Quickly and semi-covertly, the US began to add more arms to the rebels. Something, again, they have done in so many other cases to secure their interests, such as with the tens of millions of dollars going to anti-Soviet Afghan rebels for the 1980's Afghanistan War.This is the earmark. The earmark that links dozens of US covert interventions in the past 100 years and there is even evidence the US has been funding opposition groups in Iran, if not many other places in this turbulent world we see rising. It's a great strategy - low budget; mostly hidden from the general public \u2013 and completely against international law.And once the fireworks started with NATO, there was no turning back - another coup d'\u00e9tat success. Today Libya is a fragmented and destabilized terrain. Apparently is it now a \u201cDemocracy\u201d for whatever that is really worth since it is looking more like another post-war Iraq than anything else and it will likely be a long time before progress is achieved. http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/press_releases/tzm-exclusive-a-tragedy-of-circumstance ",
