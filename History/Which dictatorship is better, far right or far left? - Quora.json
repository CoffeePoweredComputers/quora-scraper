            "answer_text": "From the perspective of a citizen waiting for the dictatorship to come to an end, a far-right dictatorship would be better as they generally last a lot shorter length of time than far-left dictatorships. A far-right dictatorship will always collapse shortly after the death of the original cult leader, whereas a far-left dictatorship can survive the cult leader\u2019s death and keep passing the torch, only ending once it collapses from other conditions. From the perspective of the dictator, it depends on if you\u2019re concerned about your dictatorship extending after your death, while you\u2019re alive there would be very little difference from your perspective.

Right-wing totalitarians will party with your boss and throw you in a gas chamber if they don\u2019t like you. America has been supporting right-wing dictators for about 70 years, because right-wing dictators are friendly to America\u2019s brand of mercantile dystopian capitalism. ",
