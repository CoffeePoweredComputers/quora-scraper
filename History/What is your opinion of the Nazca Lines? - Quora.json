            "answer_text": "I believe they are a giant garden and specific plants would be planted in different lines representing a god of that plant, all the zig zag lines were to show every angle of the sun and where it would reach what crop when all year around. A sort of garden planting guide. The Nazca were expert irrigators and farmers. Their religion was food based, for a good harvest and by planting their fields in these symbols would be a great representation of a living god protecting its crop. The Nazca were scared of famine above all else. They provided enough food here to support over 100,000 people and there is evidence of trade far and wide leading me to believe that the nazca lines were a farmers market where people from around the world would come and wonder at the magnificent gardens. Machu Picchu was the water tower that fed the gardens from below. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, nobody knows for sure. But it seems that humans have always craved some kind of contact with the heavens. The Nazca lines were probably an attempt to communicate with the gods up above. People have built pyramids aligned to the stars. People everywhere have worshiped the Sun. Some ancient cultures believe we all came from the stars. All the Gods ever worshiped seem to live up in the heavens somewhere (or maybe on really tall mountains, as in ancient Greece). So, it\u2019s only natural that that we desire to communicate with the heavens, with the gods that live up there, and maybe with other civilizations on other planets. The latest examples of such attempts at interstellar communications are the SETI program (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) that focuses on listening to electromagnetic signals from outer space, \u2026 and also the golden records that were sent into space on board the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft. The Nazca people didn\u2019t have a way to send out a spacecraft to the stars, but they figured they could attract someone\u2019s attention by drawing enormous lines and drawings on the ground. Their efforts were not necessarily scientific. It was most likely the outer expression of their religion. ",
