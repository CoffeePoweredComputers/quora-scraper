            "answer_text": "A2A\u2014 Because you\u2019ve chosen \u201cpolitics\u201d as one of the characteristics of your question, I\u2019ll assume you are referring to the upcoming U.S. presidential debates (after the nominations within the two major parties). In past presidential campaigns, the voters watched the debates to get a clearer sense of whom they thought might best represent them. They also looked at the demeanor of the candidates and considered whether that candidate would represent the U.S. well. This year, it is impossible to say whether the debates will \u201cmatter.\u201d Some pundits have said that Republican Candidate Donald Trump will alienate more and more of those who are currently leaning toward voting for him because he keeps making progressively more incendiary remarks, some of which are on the verge of violating constitutional behavior. The most recent racist comments about the judge who is hearing the case about Trump University\u2019s fraudulence are such an example. (Even Republican leaders who have said they\u2019ll \u201csupport\u201d Trump\u2019s election are saying this is pure and simple racism and is unacceptable.) And then there are people, believe it or not, who are leaning against Hillary Clinton because they don\u2019t like the sound of her (female) voice when she makes adamant statements. They will be critical of her \u201cnuanced\u201d answers to questions (which can sound like waffling or avoiding answering strongly and definitively). Should Bernie Sanders convince the vast majority of Democrat super-delegates to switch their allegiance from Clinton to him and he becomes the candidate, the debates will be a chance for the Sanders faithful to strengthen their conviction that their candidate is not only the best alternative to Trump but that he is a brilliant proponent of the changes they want to see in national politics. They will hit the streets and reference each ill-considered comment Trump makes during the debates. There are still voters who are undecided about their presidential choice. The rest of us can only hope that they watch these debates and make a principled choice based on their own values and priorities. ",

            "answer_text": "Simple answer = Because people will always disagree. Debate is just a more formal way to disagree. Because it has rules and structure it takes out much of the emotion in an argument or verbal fight. This allows us to evaluate the merits of the claims more objectively and to come to a better decision. Given that both sides want to \u201cwin\u201d it encourages them to find supporting research, experts in that field, or create examples that show the logic (or illogic of their opponents) of the position. So we need debate to teach us how to find the strongest points for our position. We need debate to teach us how to research topics. We need debate to teach us how to structure a position so that it\u2019s organized and flows and that an audience can understand it. We need debate to teach us the tricks that other people use against us to get emotion responses. To see the gaps in logic they present. To learn how to evaluate the supporting information of their claims to see if it truly supports their position. Every time you go for a job interview, go for a raise, make a life changing decision, argue with your significant other, evaluate a politician\u2019s speech, or any of the hundreds of other things that impact your life you need debate skills. Communication is the bedrock of our society and it\u2019s worth your time to learn to have better skills at evaluating it.
