            "answer_text": "Nuclear weapons without a doubt. Japan and America in the second world war were fighting it out quite roughly, and numerous people were killed. America had probably devised thousands of attacks. Japan at the time, was one of the worlds powers. Then, America dropped two nukes and Japan surrendered. Nukes are only stronger than ever now. There are nukes that are hundreds of times more powerful than the ones dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Tsar Bomb was the most powerful nuclear warhead ever set off, and it was set off in 1961, thousands of times stronger than the one set off in Hiroshima. Hydrogen Bombs can be up to 5,000x times stronger than the Hiroshima blast. It is estimated that all the nukes in the world could destroy Earth several hundred times over. ",

As everything in our world is made of matter so antimatter cannot be stored in normal canisters or tubes. It requires special care. Just a little of it can power a big city. ALSO , if it reaches the wrong hands it would destroy everything. ",
