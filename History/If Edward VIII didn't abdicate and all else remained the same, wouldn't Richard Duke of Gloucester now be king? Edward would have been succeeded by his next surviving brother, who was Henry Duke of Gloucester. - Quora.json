            "answer_text": "No. The line of succession would have gone via the sons of George V in order but the children of those sons would also have had rights. If Edward VIII had been King in 1972 his heir would have been HRH The Princess Elizabeth, The Duchess of Edinburgh. Second in line would have been HRH Prince Charles of Edinburgh. Go back to 1837 \u2026 William IV died. The throne didn\u2019t pass to his next eldest living brother but to the daughter of the deceased next eldest brother - Victoria. The line of succession in 1819 \u2026 when Victoria was born \u2026 George Prince of Wales, Frederick Duke of York, William Duke of Clarence, Edward Duke of Kent, Victoria of Kent, Ernest Duke of Cumberland \u2026.. In 1820 Edward Duke of Kent died so Victoria moved up one place to become the heiress presumptive to her Uncle William. From then to 1837 she continued to move up as first Frederick and then George and finally William died. Ernest inherited Hanover due to the Salic Law there but Victoria inherited Britain as the daughter of the fourth son while Ernest was the fifth son and his place was behind all of his brothers and their descendants. Just because their father had died in wouldn\u2019t have moved Elizabeth and Margaret out of the line of succession. In 1936, when George V died, the line of succession was Edward, Albert, Elizabeth, Margaret, Henry, George, Edward, Mary \u2026 Had Edward remained as King and Albert still died in 1952 then Elizabeth would have moved up one to become the heiress presumptive. Henry couldn\u2019t take away the rights of his nieces to be monarchs before him. Elizabeth II has three sons. If Charles dies before becoming King the throne doesn\u2019t pass to the Queen\u2019s next eldest son but to Charles\u2019 eldest son - William not Andrew. The line goes to the eldest son (if born before October 2011) and then down that son\u2019s descendants so ALL of Charles\u2019 descendants come before any of Andrew\u2019s descendants who are all before any of Edward\u2019s and then Anne\u2019s.

            "answer_text": "Actually, there is a good argument that this would actually be the case. IF Edward VIII had reigned until his death in 1972, then his next surviving brother would indeed, have been Prince Richard, his brother Bertie (George VI) having died in 1952. But there are a LOT of variables here, so we cannot say that \u201call else remained the same\u201d, because it would not have remained the same. The obvious variable was that both Wallis and David were massive Nazi sympathisers and Hitler fans, and it\u2019s perfectly possible that the UK would have capitulated and come under Nazi rule. Certainly Hitler had elaborate plans drawn up to install David and Wallis as puppet King and Queen in the event of a Nazi victory. Whether the monarchy would actually have survived as Nazi puppets, we will thankfully never know. The other big consideration would be that Bertie died at only 56, of lung cancer, which the late Queen Mother firmly believed was caused by the stress of the Abdication, and the Kingship. Bertie had never been fully trained to be King; like Prince Harry, he was the \u201cspare\u201d. He was a heavy smoker as a way of dealing with the stress, and the stress and fags killed him. If he hadn\u2019t had to deal with the stress of leadership dropped on him, he might have outlived his brother. In which case he would have become King anyway, and we would still have the Queen we have today. The third possibility, which is very remote, but still a possibility, would be that David and Wallis produced a child of their own. There is speculation that Wallis was infertile, and/or that David was infertile due to a bout of mumps; and she was 41 when they married. But as far as I know there is no concrete evidence of either his or her infertility, it\u2019s just speculation. If they had managed to reproduce, then the child would be our monarch now. ",
