            "answer_text": "The Soviet Union did bore the brunt of casualties in the European theater of WW2, and they were indeed responsible for destroying more German soldiers and armies than the Western Powers. Close to 11 million Soviet soldiers were killed, along with possibly 20, 30, 40 million civilians. The blame for this is usually put on Stalin\u2019s disregard for the lives of his soldiers, the poor strategies employed by the Soviets and general lack of training on the part of Soviet soldiers. Those things certainly played a bit role, however, the largest reason there were so many Soviets casualties on the Eastern Front is the general depraved barbarity of the Nazi state and the Wehrmacht. Soviets soldiers usually fought to the death simply because they knew they , along with their families, towns and villages would be destroyed if the Germans won. Hitler's occupation of countries such as Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, and France was harsh, but was not aimed at inflicting widespread depopulation (with the exception of the Jews) on those nations. Unlike his earlier conquests, Hitler ordered (Kommissarbefehl) his generals in 1941 to conduct the war against the USSR as one of annihilation rather than capture and coercion. He wanted the populations out or dead. The German invasion of the Soviet Union was the only attack during the war employing the concept of Einsatzgruppen (tasks forces) which followed just behind the attacking forces with specific orders from Hitler to kill, \"... all potential leaders of society (meaning to wipe out the intelligentsia), all communists, Jews, Gypsies, guerrillas, saboteurs and those capable of resistance. This written policy of annihilation was also given to three million German soldiers just before the attack on June 22, 1941. Soviet prisoners were often just shot, or sent to internment camps and left to starve. When German troops marched into Russian territory that in 1941 they were often greeted as liberators by village populations weary of Stalin's rule. That soon changed as the people began to witness the treatment inflicted on them by the Einsatzgruppen. The Germans emptied the land and moved on. All communists, everyone with an education and the Jews were murdered. Grain, farm animals, equipment and anything of possible value were stolen or sent back to Germany. Villages and homes were torched. Objecting civilians were slaughtered and the rest left to starve. This was not just the looting of art or precious metals that went on in Western Europe; this was stripping the land for depopulation by starvation. Even General Eisenhower, no stranger to war-damaged towns and cities, was appalled by the extent of depopulation and wrote in his memoir: \"When we flew into Russia, in 1945, I did not see a house standing between the western borders of the country and the area around Moscow. Through this overrun region, Marshal Zhukov told me, so many numbers of women, children and old men had been killed that the Russian Government would never be able to estimate the total. Furthermore. One thing that is always forgotten about WW2 is: The Chinese. For all practical purposes, WW2 actually started in 1937 with the Japanese invasion of China, which was as brutal and inhumane as the German invasion of Russia, and they both used the same cruelty playbook. Close to 7-8 million Chinese soldiers were killed and maybe between 20-30 million Chinese civilians were killed (impossible to know for certain). On the Japanese side, the Sino-Japanese War caused between 3-5 million military casualties. So while the Soviets get lots of marks for battling the Germans, and the Americans for pushing back the Japanese in the Pacific, it\u2019s hard to ignore what the Chinese went through fighting the Japanese.

            "answer_text": "Yes, not only in lives and suffering, but also in how much damage they inflicted on Nazi Germany.The sheer scale of combat on the Eastern Front of the European Theater has probably never been equaled in human history. The British, Americans, and the other Allies in Europe (beg your pardon for not listing them all, it's a matter of space, not a judgment on their contributions) for all their suffering and effort, just can't really compare. While the Brits were fighting around the margins in places like Crete and Libya, German panzer armies were killing and capturing Soviet forces by the millions in Operation Barbarossa. In 1942/43, while American forces were trying to figure out how to fight in Africa, and then getting bogged down in Italy, the Soviets had annihilated an entire German army at Stalingrad (anywhere from 1.2 to 2 million casualties,) turning the tide of the war. While American and British forces were stalemated at the Anzio beachhead, the Soviets had already won the battle of Kursk, the largest tank battle in history involving about 3 million men, 5,000 tanks, and 35,000 tubes of artillery. While the Western Allies were landing about 156,000 troops in Normandy and fighting to capture parts of France in Operation Neptune, Soviet Operation Bagration pitted (by some counts) over 2 million Soviet troops against over 1 million Germans, resulting in the complete destruction of an entire German army group and nearly half a million German forces. You get the idea. Put simply, by the time the western allies really got to grips with the Nazis on the European mainland in 1944, the Soviets had already ripped the guts out of the Wermacht and Waffen SS. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not by a long shot. They bore the brunt of casualties, many of whom were unnecessary and a result of terrible politics, purges and overall low quality of command. They also killed more German troops than they fell in the West, which is commonly mistaken for overall effort. In reality, most of German war effort overall was directed towards the West. It\u2019s not even a contest. True, they sent the most men to Russia from 1941, but if you were to calculate the total cost of the Battle of the Atlantic, you\u2019d come to realize Germany was probably spending more resources on staving off Britain at sea than than they did at defeating Russia. Submarines are expensive, battleships even more so, neither was aimed at Russia. Sure the African campaign was considered an afterthought, but the logistical situation there tied up disproportionally more trucks and logistical capability than the force size would otherwise imply. These would make an major impact three or four times in the East. German losses at Stalingrad were severe, there is no doubt there. But little attention is given to the surrender of Axis at Tunisia, where a similar number of troops was captured. They weren\u2019t subsequently killed, which is why this recieves less attention, but this is undeserved, captured Germans weren\u2019t fighting the war any more than dead ones were. Germans lost about as many tanks in North Africa as they did at Kursk. Germans deployed up to ten aircraft to guard from Allied bombers for each one they had available at the East. They deployed about 3 out of every 4 artillery shells to guard from Allied bombers and this doesn\u2019t even count artillery rounds used in Africa, Italy, France or the Kriegsmarine. Germans had two men manning the AA guns back home for each Axis one lost (including wounded) at Stalingrad, half of them weren\u2019t even German. Sum all of these up and you get the right perspective. Russia was crucial at defeating the Nazis, no other nation was ready to bleed quite as heavily for what was essentially an unnecessary war for them. Two more things to keep in mind. First, British and the Americans could let the Soviets bleed until they collapsed and then let economics of occupying that much land plus nightly bomber raids bankrupt the Nazis. This would be possible as late as 1944, Hitler wasn\u2019t going to sue for peace with Russia if he saw the possibility of a victory. Russia would collapse by 1945 and perhaps earlier if it commanded the attention of most of Wehrmacht any longer than it did. The second thing to keep in mind is that while Nazi panzers were rolling into France, Nazi U-Boats starving Britain into submission and when Nazi Bombers were bombing London, they were doing so with Soviet-provided fuel, replacement parts were made with Soviet-provided raw materials and their crews were fed with Soviet-provided staples. Any sensible judgment of Soviet war effort should substract this from their total. This is routinely forgotten, but it shouldn\u2019t be. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No, Depends how you wage it\u2026 lives lost or who did the most for victory. Because while the Soviet Union and Germany clashed at a cataclysmic scale unprecedented in long history of human warfare, I don't believe they did the most for victory. I believe that the United States did the most for final victory. The production industrial capabilities were extremely high, and the Americans would literally feed all the other allies in the fight against the axis. The Soviet Union would receive millions of tons of lend lease from the United States. Even stalin would state to Zhukov that the Soviet Union could not withstand the industrial might of Germany without the United States helping the Soviet Union (even more so since Germany controlled all of Europe and most of European Russia). The most important measure in my eyes is not the number of soldiers you lost, but the industrial complex you can project on your enemies. NOBODY in world war 2 did this better than the USA, nobody does it better even now. American manufactured guns were waging war against Germany and Japan on nearly every continent. American carriers and Air Force were all over the planet. Remember also that the Americans kept Britain alive. The Americans also bore the brunt of the weight in defeating the Soviet Union by bleeding them in proxy wars in the Cold War. The nation of bookkeepers(as Europeans called Americans), used that skill to defeat every European tyrant regime. The incredible part is the US could have sold guns to everyone and biult up their navies and sat it out for the war and got rich while the rest of the world got destroyed and poor. But they went in and saved the world from destroying itself and spread its values and government everywhere. The US is the critical factor in world war 2, anyone who could make an arguement otherwise, well I am listening. ",

The USA bore a large portion of the financial burden through Lend/Lease, but in terms of getting your hands dirty, the USSR did far and away the lions share of the fighting in Europe. More Russians died on the Eastern Front than all the deaths on all sides in all wars in the world that have happened after WW2 until now combined. Soviets killed 4/5 of all the German soldiers killed in the war. That\u2019s 80% of the killing. The Soviets alone sacrificed almost as many soldiers as ALL other combatant powers in WW2 combined. Not just all other Allies combined, but 45% of both Axis and Allied countries combined combat deaths were Soviet. ",
