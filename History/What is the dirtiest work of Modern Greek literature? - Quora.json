            "answer_text": "I know of three contenders; and having rebrowsed through one, I\u2019m eliminating it from contention. I am, by the way, extending the definition back to 1000 AD. The contender I have not read (yet) is the only contender from the past century: The Great Eastern, by Greek surrealist Andreas Embirikos. It\u2019s an encyclopaedia of all kinds known of sexual activity, ranging from wet dreams to coprophagia, and from missionary to incest. It\u2019s pretty much 120 Days of Sodom on a boat, except it\u2019s supposed to be liberating and utopian instead of nasty and dystopian. And eccentrically for 20th century literature, it is in Puristic Greek, which is meant to give it a Cavafy-esque detachment. (The two tiny excerpts on Wikipedia, which are clean, make it sound more like a 19th century romance novel, but that\u2019s not what I should be judging it from.) The contender I\u2019ve just re-read is the poetry of Stephanos Sachlikis, written ca 1370 in Crete. I\u2019ve written a little on him already at Nick Nicholas's post in Op\u026fd\u0292\u026fl\u026fkl\u0251r In Exile. This question was inspired by the late editor Nikos Panagiotakis\u2019 prefatory comment, that his poetry is the dirtiest work of Greek literature up until The Great Eastern. \u2026 I don\u2019t think Panagiotakis, God rest him, got out much. No. It isn\u2019t. Sure, Sachlikis says \u201cfuck\u201d a lot, when talking about the prostitutes of Candia. That\u2019s the extent of it. It\u2019s not like he enumerates positions or perversions; \u201cfriar-fucked\u201d (\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7) is as colourful as he gets. Being misogynistic about prostitutes (but then again, Sachlikis hates everybody, including himself), blaming the widow Koutayotaina for his downfall, and conjuring up a fanciful jousting match between prostitutes competing for working space in Candia\u2014these may count as historically and psychologically informative material, and it may be a rollicking good read. (Greeks are constantly astonished at how easily they understand Sachlikis, even if there are archaic and dialectal bits there.) But dirty? Maybe in Panagiotakis\u2019 generation; not in mine. The prize, as far as I\u2019m concerned, still goes to the work that Panagiotakis knew full well about, and it was special pleading for him to pretend he didn\u2019t when he lectured on Sachlikis. It\u2019s Spanos, the Mass of the Beardless Man.  There\u2019s a dearth of information online about Spanos, which is a shame. Spanos is a parody of the Greek Orthodox Mass, targeting a hapless, unnamed victim who is himself spanos. Spanos means \u201cbeardless\u201d. The late lexicographer Tassos Karanastassis argued in his PhD that Spanos is a piece of millenarian panic, written about the arrival of the Jews from Spain (Hi-spanos) in 1492 (the year 7000 by Byzantine reckoning); I didn\u2019t find his arguments overwhelmingly convincing, but he did tap into an underexplored current of folk culture when researching it. Spanos is relentless. Spanos is filthy. Spanos heaps obscenity upon obscenity upon its victim, whatever his origin and provenance; beatings, excrement, impalement, nothing is too brutal for him. And it does it all with note-perfect parodies of the Orthodox liturgy\u2014including several highlights of the Good Friday Mass. As its editor Hans Eideneier notes, the spontaneous reaction of Greek cantors confronted with it is (after recovering from the shock) to start chanting along. (Karanastassis unearthed evidence that bits of Spanos were still being chanted by cantors as entertainment centuries later, in the writings of Alexandros Papadiamantis.) In fact, Spanos is so relentless, it overflows the liturgical genre, and throws in Saint\u2019s Lives, dowry contracts and medical remedies for good measure. Kind of like a scatological Ulysses (although Ulysses is already scatological). And it includes the very first instance of Byzantine musical notation in print. Greece\u2019s poet laureate Giorgos Seferis was a pretty astute critic, and he said something very perceptive about Spanos once. He liked it, because it was one of the very few instances Greek has to show of nonsense poetry. Spanos is closer in spirit to the usual exemplar of the limerick than to Edward Lear\u2019s gentle variants of the form. But it\u2019s just as silly, for all its viciousness, and Greek literature doesn\u2019t really do silly all that often. Nick Nicholas's post in Hellenica ",
