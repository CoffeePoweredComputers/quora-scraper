            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, I don\u2019t see many chances for someone like myself, but I suppose I can try answering. Now, let\u2019s provide some more context to this. Considering I\u2019m just some weird dude they happened to find somewhere, I\u2019d probably be thrown in with criminals and such lowlifes, given some summary training and sent out there to fight a little until one of the real badasses runs several inches of iron through my ribcage. (P.S. I\u2019ll assume I was given the ability to speak and write in latin) So, here am I, being examinated by some assholes in order to decide in which way I\u2019ll be trained. Now, given the fact I\u2019m a slim person and almost 6\u20322\u2033 tall, I\u2019d probably become a retiarius.  I\u2019m not some ancient combat expert, but I believe this equipment and style of fighting suits me the most. Lightly armored, so I don\u2019t need to carry too much weight around, a long but not particularly heavy weapon that emphatises reach. Couple this with my arms that are surely longer than the average of that time, and I\u2019d be able to hurt people from a pretty damn long distance. Works for me. I like my body with no sharp things in it. Now, let\u2019s get to my plan. First of all, I need to not only survive the training phase in order to stand a chance, I need to absolutely rock it. I\u2019m really skinny, but consodering I\u2019ll probs be a good deal taller than everybody else, I\u2019ll need to get as physically fit as humanly possible in a short time and with bad nutrition. I\u2019ll have to operate with the same calorie intake as the others, which could be harmful given my size, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll work me like a slave and with the bare food minimum to survive. The food ratio will probably be enough to not lose any weight. So all I can do is get as toned and fit as I can in what I assume would be several months of very intensive training. Now let\u2019s assume I\u2019m done training and strong enough to compete at an at least adequate level. If that\u2019s not the case, I\u2019d die shortly. My plan is to stand out from the rest. If I can\u2019t do it through fighting skills, I will have to become creative. Pull in some breakdance moves before a fight. Scream and laugh like a madman as I drive a pitchfork through some poor guy\u2019s torso. That\u2019s all if my 21st century peaceful mindset can handle all this shit, of course. But hey, most of the others can\u2019t be battle ready from the start. Let\u2019s hope I\u2019m not sent against some tough guy like a jobber against John Cena. If I manage to survive my first fights and make a reputation as the crazy, flip performing, bloodthirsty motherfucker, the crowd would get on my side, which can really save me if I get my ass handed to me. But that\u2019s not the real plan. Let\u2019s be realistic here. There\u2019s no way I can fight through hundreds of my enemies \u2018till I win imperial favour and my liberty. Of course, there\u2019s no telling what kind of person I can become in such a violent environment, but I don\u2019t see the person I am now doing this. What I\u2019d try to do, is stand out with whom I need to. Make smart, subtle comments to my higher ups, try to attract attention by obviously pointing out I\u2019m not meant to be there. Like, hello, I\u2019m a modern times person amongst Rome\u2019s lowest, most uneducated scumbags. There\u2019s no shred of doubt in my mind I\u2019d stick out like a sore thumb without really trying. If I am lucky, maybe someone powerful would be sharp enough to sense there\u2019s something different about me and pull some strings to get me the f out. Maybe to ask about a strange coin trick, my weird way of speaking, hell, maybe just to use as a whacky servant. So in short, just survive for a while \u2018till I attract enough attention to myself that someone would realise I have the potential to be used for something outside of an arena. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Using any superior knowledge\u2026 See, in ancient times there were no purely factual analyses of the human body- the closest we get is the work of Galen, incidentally from experiencing, healing and writing about the wounds of gladiators. He was wrong about how the body worked, most importantly the pulmonary system, but the theory worked well enough that for the next thousand years or so it was considered the truth. At the heyday of the gladiatorial games, therefore, the most authoritative source of medical knowledge was inaccurate. What this means, in practice, is that I can find those veins that kill my opponent in the fastest time while guarding my own from, say, a spear and taking a flesh wound. Now, I could always spare them- which I preferably would. But if I had to kill them I would know how to, and if I were wounded I would know to actually save myself instead of somebody covering it in olive leaves to make my arm healthy again. I also have the history of every single fighting culture known to mankind at my disposal. Romans at this time have (generally) only fought in a Roman, Germanic, Danube-centric or Persian stereotype in the arena. But what if I apply modern methods of fighting, disarming and movement? Perhaps wield my sword and shield in the manner of duelling that medieval knights would have used? Even, it could be said, could I adopt the fighting style of the Meiji era, should I so wish. So I suppose, in this thought experiment, I would fight. I would probably die -I don\u2019t live a life of manual labour and thus have the strength of a leaf of paper- but I could win in this fashion. ",
