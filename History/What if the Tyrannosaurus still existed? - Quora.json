            "answer_text": "The Tyrannosaurus Rex probably would not do well in our time. First, it lived in what is now northern United States and Southern Canada. It's quite cold in these areas, and it is possible the Rex would be unsuited for the climate. Second, the food it would eat is still gone. It would have to hunt much more often, and would not be as healthy as it was. The largest animals it would be able to feast on were Elk, Moose, and possibly Bison. That being said, I will present two scenarios. The first being a scenario where a new species of tyrannosaurus evolved for these cold climates and new food sources (much like yutyrannus). The second being a scenario where the Rex migrated to Southern parts of the Americas. This new species of Tyrannosaurus, let's call it Tyrannosaurus Princeps (from the Latin word for prince), is smaller, about the size of an allosaurus. It has a large covering of dull feathers, Grey and white in order to blend in with snow and rocks. It hunts in packs of 3 or 4, one male leading and mating females in follow. It is likely this predator would take the niche of wolves in the time line. It's smaller frame would allow it to be faster. It's legs would be stronger in order to move through snow more easily, and it's feet would be proportionately larger. It would prey on stray elk, and oftentimes tussle with the largest of moose. In the other scenario, a massive beast of a rex lurks along the Amazon River. No predators can outcompete it as it hunts almost exclusively during its life. Rarely stopping to mate. This rex likely is thinner than its ancestors, but mostly the same. I'm both situations the tyrannosaurus would be hunted for its hide, teeth, and skull for trophies. We would likely drive it to extinction after too long. ",

            "answer_text": "If T-Rex was alive today, there would have been a lot of hindrances in the ecosystem because they would be the dominant species after humans. however, they might not survive due to less space, industrialization, habitat loss, pollution or global warming. Also, humans are so advanced today they could easily create new technology to capture them or to keep them in control. Dinosaurs were kind of destructive animals that why nature wiped them out (mass extinction) and I think soon us humans might get extinct to keep the earth peaceful. T-rex could actually destroy humans work with its hopefully amazing powers of fire, strength, etc. ",
