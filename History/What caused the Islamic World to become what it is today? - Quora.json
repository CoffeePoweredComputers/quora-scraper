            "answer_text": "Lack of knowledge and education. The Muslim community has been in shatters ever since the fall of the Ottoman Empire. After the Ottoman Empire fell, radical and extremist ideologies that were used for political gain by certain Kingdoms and governments, overran the Muslim world. Islamic scholars became more focused not on the unity of Islam, but the unity of their respective sect. Muslims became ignorant and engaged not in education and social progressiveness, but in upping their sect against another. The lack of knowledge and education was the reason why former (yes, they are not) Muslims were susceptible to terroristic ideologies. They began listening to people who were uneducated in religious and worldly knowledge. Corruption became the new currency; education was the lowest concern Muslim leaders had. Countries like Canada, America, Australia, Russia, and the United Kingdom flourish (economically, socially, and militarily) succeeded and still succeed because we focus on issues like immigration, education, healthcare, and extensive politics. The Muslims of today and those who engage in extremist ideologies bicker about which technicality shall be discussed upon today. Furthermore, they convey Muslims as if they are barbarians who live in the 9th century BCE. Internally, the religion of Islam was made to be a religion that would be sustained till the end of days. Rather than sustaining the religion, lack of religious and worldly knowledge has led Muslims astray. So how do we solve this? The Muslim community must focus on educating children not only in religious affairs, but in worldly matters. We live on this Earth and must learn the language it speaks. Members of the Islamic community used to be on top of several industries including: the scientific community, the legal community, the military community, the political community, the architectural community, and the mathematical community.

            "answer_text": "There was a golden period of the Islamic world, but largely this is not looked at in depth. What was it based on? It was based on an Imperial period of the Islamic world. In this Islamic world, large areas were brought under what would be a continuous zone of control which stretched from India to Spain. This was the largest Empire based on faith, until the British Empire nearly 1000 years later. Many of contributions such Arabic numerals, are were actually Indian in origin and then passed on the west as an Arab invention. The concept of Zero and the decimal system were also Indian as were many of the principles of Calculus and nearly all of Geometry. \u201cMuch of the Hindu approach to mathematics was certainly conveyed to western Europe through Arabs . The Algebraic method formerly considered to have been invented by Al Khowarizimi can now be seen to stem from Hindu sources As in the rest of mathematical science so in Trigonometry, were the Arabs pupils of the Hindus and still more of the Greeks, but not without important devices of their own. For over five hundred years Arabic writers and others continued to apply to works on arithmetic the name Indian. Another important early treatise that publicized decimal numbers was Iranian mathematician and astronomer Kushyar ibn Labban's Kitab fi usul hisab al-hind ( principals of Hindu reckoning ) a leading arithmetic book .\u201d Of course this is not to say that Arabs did not contribute to these fields. But, the inspiration came to them because they through conquest vast terriotories spanning from India all the way to Spain. This is no small feat and must be appreciated for what it is. The Arab world at this time was far more liberal in it\u2019s approach to learning and in fact did give great credit to India and Greece as for their ancient knowledge. And, the Islamic world than innovated upon these concepts. As at time it was far more outward looking than today. \u201cProbably the first Islamic hospital was established in Baghdad Yahya ibn Khalid ibn Barmak, tutor and subsequently vizier of Harun al-Rashid when the latter became Khalif in 786. Yahya ibn Khalid ibn Barmak's hospital, usually referred to as the Barmakid Hospital must have been established before 803, the year in which the Barmakid family fell from power. The hospital is mentioned in two places in the Fihrist which was written in 997. Ibn Dahn, Al Hindi, who administered the Bimaristan of the Barmak. He translated from the Indian language into Arabic. Yahya ibn Khalid ordered Mankah (Kankah), the Indian, to translate it (an Indian book of medicine) at the hospital to render it in the form of a compilation\u201d Thus, the Islamic world served a conduit of transferring knowledge from Ancient India and Ancient Greece to a Europe which was in the dark ages and void of learning during this period. Even Islamic medicine know as Unani Medicine contains elements of Ayurvedic medicine and relies heavily on the teachings of Ancient Greece. It simply shows, that once the interchange of ideas stopped, the dynamic golden age of Islam also ceased. And, an inward looking perspective began to dominate the Islamic world. This of course resulted in newer upstarts from Europe to then establish their own Imperial ambitions. And as can be seen since colonialism ended, a new dynamic has again emerged in Asia. Where two colonized nations China and India are today leading the world in growth. But, it will take them decades to become the innovators they were 1500 years ago, but they are well on their way. The Islamic world will also have to one day decide to again pursue dynamic goals and resist the temptations to be self limited. As is the cause of stagnation and lack of beneficial progress which every civilization requires to have balance and is the principle of Algebra which is Arabic means to balance. *quotations from Wikipedia.
