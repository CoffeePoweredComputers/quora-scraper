            "answer_text": "You must be talking about that awkward moment when me and my girlfriend skipped school to go back to my house to fuck all day. Unfortunately for us my parents must have had some type of appt for whatever because as I was driving down my street I caught sight of their cars and had to slam on the brakes and backup the street. We ended up going to a park that was undergoing renovation, but after only a few minutes of steamy making out the dreaded tap, tap, tap shot through the car like a bullet. I immediately knew it was a cop and that we were in deep doodoo. We managed to partially dress and the officer asked me to talk to him outside, after a quite lengthy list of reasons why skipping school and having sex at our age were unwise he told me to take her home and for me to do the same. Awkward multiplied by a factor of two. Being the know it all that I was, and having a sex crazed nympho girlfriend, we talked shit about the encounter while driving around town looking for another spot to get back to business. After nearly an hour of driving I lucked up on a dead end dirt road near the airport. It was incredibly exhilarating screwing on the hood of my car as planes flew overhead to land. Sadly neither of us heard the sheriff's deputies until after the plane had passed. There's nothing more embarrassing than for two teens to be stark naked in the company of adults let alone law enforcement. Fortunately for us the two departments hadn't communicated with each other and after another stern talking to, we were told to get home. Yup. You guessed it. We were nodding our heads saying yes sir, yes ma'am, etc. ,but it was in one ear and out of the other. By this point it was almost 1pm so we knew we didn't have much time but we weren't done. Miraculously I managed to fly across town without so much as a glimpse of any cops, I was a speed freak and apparently a magnet for tickets, and we wound up in a neighborhood I didn't know. After a few laps through the new neighborhood I found a reservoir with a paved road encircling the area, it was fenced off but the lock wasn't latched so like a fucking retard I opened the gate drove in and shut the gate. We rode about halfway around the reservoir to a grove of willows where I parked. AWKWARD! All the windows were steamed up and we were going at it like it was the last time on earth\u2026 Tap, Tap, Tap\u2026 Mr Hunter. At this very moment I realized that both my nuts and heart could relocate to my throat. I knew the voice outside and knew it was going to be bad. We both got dressed and stepped out of the car to see the cop from the first time and a few others. One misdemeanor pot possession charge, two charges of indecent and lewd behavior, and a few charges for my girlfriend as well, and the shame of waiting for our parents to come pick us up. What tangled webs we weave while fucking like rabbits in the backseat of our cars. Wouldn't change one bit of that day for anything. ",
