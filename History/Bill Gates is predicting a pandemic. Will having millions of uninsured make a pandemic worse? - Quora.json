He assumes similar fatality rates to the Spanish Flu in 1918. Details here: Pandemic Simulation used in Gates Shattuck Lecture. But his point wasn\u2019t really to try to prophesy a pandemic. Rather he was saying we can do things to prevent it and he spent the rest of his talk outlining the many things we are already doing to help prevent such pandemics and what we can do in the future. He was saying that we are developing tools to prevent it but have to have a co-ordinated response. The methods include methods of rapidly developing vaccines, methods for rapid diagnosis of a new threat, stockpiling anti viral drugs and antibodies to act in the early stages (because a vaccine can take a couple of weeks to develop), and using computer models to help predict pandemics. He also mentions the new Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations which is a public / private partnership. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation - Wikipedia has as one of its primary purposes to enhance health care, worldwide. His speech is part of their work on this. Finding ways to prevent pandemics as well as to eliminate or almost eliminate the worst diseases in the world as far as possible just as we have already eliminated smallpox, and rhinderpest for cattle, and have nearly eliminated polio in the wild. Eradication of infectious diseases - Wikipedia So he was definitely not doing this in a \u201cWe are doomed, nothing we can do\u201d kind of way, which is how his speech was widely reported, but the opposite \u201cWe can handle this, there\u2019s lots we can do and this is what we are doing already about it\u201d. Best to read what he said yourself rather than the click bait sensationalist stories about it. His speech is here The next epidemic is coming. Here\u2019s how we can make sure we\u2019re ready. The model is explained here, but remember he is saying we can prevent this and are already doing a lot to prevent it, he says we should be doing a lot more:  Pandemic Simulation used in Gates Shattuck Lecture See also: WHO report figure of 50 - 80 million at risk in pandemic is based on paper that assumes outbreak is contained by use of medicine of 1918!

            "answer_text": "From a comment: An uninsured person will be less likely to see a doctor until their situation was dire\u2026They could be spreading a deadly pathogen for awhile\u2026 The flu of 1918 was spread by people who were showing no symptoms at all. By the time they had symptoms, they were so sick that they could not have gone to the doctor, and there wasn\u2019t a whole heck of a lot that doctor could have done. It was nursing care that made the life-and-death difference, not doctoring, mostly. We still don\u2019t have great anti-viral treatments, and therefore, if a new pandemic is similar to the 1918 pandemic, insurance will not affect the outcome. Spread will be contained with quarantines and travel bans, and people will live or die based on the care available in their immediate vicinity. A pandemic\u2014the 1918 flu may have killed 50 MILLION people\u2014would overwhelm the existing health care system. Insured or not, you would be able to GET to the doctor, and there will be sick people in the waiting room, exposing you to more germs. Years ago, I was seeking a consult about possibly rabies exposure. No-one knew where to start. Someone recommended the Infectious Disease clinic at UNC-CH. I thought about it, and then realized the waiting room was likely to be full of people with tuberculosis, which was the ID running wild at the time. I kept looking for a better option. (Turns out, rabies intake happens through emergency departments\u2019 triage / urgent care units.) Depending on the outbreak, it\u2019s likely that population management is going to have more to do with spread than direct medical care. Wash your hands. ",

            "answer_text": "The critical factors of a pandemic would include limited natural or secondary immunity and a significant period after infection while both contagious and mobile. A third factor is the ease of infection transfer. Ebola seems to require physical contact with body fluids. Chicken pox is spread by air. The critical factors of high mortality include the severity and duration of direct symptoms, the availability of supplies to ameliorate those symptoms, the infection rate, background health of the population and the ability of the society to adjust to the absence of the labor of those incapacitated. Having millions of people without health insurance is not going to significantly impact stored fats, diet, or caloric intake. The expected rise in chronic conditions - diabetes, hypertension, obesity, untreated heart conditions and other things that people try to cope with, rather than treat, are not likely to significantly increase mortality from secondary effects of the disease. Even with health insurance, human nature is to shrug off a slightly off feeling. A day lost at work is often a day without a paycheck. People want to pull their weight at work. The people just beginning to feel a bit off are going to infect their coworkers, fellow shoppers, family and fellow commuters. Unless mortality or even, somehow contagion is enhanced by under-treatment of conditions normally corrected in well patient visits (unlikely), we would not expect a significant change in the spread of the disease in a nation lacking health insurance. A pandemic that requires massive attention and resources to contain the mortality rate is going to exhaust the capacity of the existing medical infrastructure as well as the capacity of insurers to absorb the costs. Emergency aid facilities, start up clinics in the field will be needed. These will be funded by government, as part of the response to the pandemic. ",

If you can avoid catching it by getting a very expensive immunization, then rich people and people with good medical insurance will do better. Immunizing a lot of people can help prevent the spread even to people who aren\u2019t immunized. But, what most people mean by pandemic is, \u201cWe won\u2019t understand it. We won\u2019t be able to prevent it\u2019s spread. Treatments won\u2019t help much. It will sweep the world before we figure it out.\u201d In that case, having medical insurance won\u2019t matter. There might be a borderline case, that developed slowly enough for immunizations to be developed, and where only expensive immunization could keep a particularly nasty flue from spreading widely enough to shut down a country\u2019s food production and distribution. You might think European countries would do better than the U.S. But I bet the U.S. would mobilize widespread immunizations, even for those without health insurance, even without visiting doctors or hospitals. I advocate universal health care. But medical R&D is much more important in preventing the \u201cnext\u201d pandemic. Past R&D and the development of annual flue shots may have already prevented a couple of strains of flue from becoming pandemics. ",

All colds and flu epidemics originate in China. The US and UN could pressure them to do more. Most fatal viruses , like terrorism, come from failed states in the African continent. The US should work with Cuban doctors in Africa (there are thousands) and focus more on viral epidemics and less on terrorism. Vaccinations should be obligatory.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s hard to say, but the overall premise for the pandemic is that drug resistant bacteria or a particularly deadly virus will come. If modern medicine cannot come up with a solution quickly, then a pandemic occurs. Just like with a vaccine for polio, if an antidote or vaccine is developed, most nations will try their best to administer it, unilaterally if necessary. It\u2019s a big hit to their tax revenue, ya know. If we assume that a pandemic does take place and there is no solution before it takes hold, then insurance will not really change anything. The government will go into damage control, providing health services for those infected and starting a quarantine. This is evidenced by publicly available emergency planning information. Insurance as a healthcare provider, while a curious idea, is mostly about prevention. If a pandemic occurs that cannot be treated or cured comes, all it would be able to do is foot the cost for what boils down to comfort care. Not that it would matter, as such a vast quantity of people pulling claims will bankrupt the insurers and/or cause a huge dip on confidence in the healthcare sector. And the government would pretty much eclipse any of their efforts anyways. In short, probably not. ",

If we don\u2019t shut down most gatherings one can infect many and they spread it to more. Something like an airliner with one sick person can infect people traveling all over the world and they might infect many before they know they have it. Some TSA agents have it, how many did they breath on or touch. A friend\u2019s mother got it at the hospital from a roommate. A local nursing home has had about 20 deaths from about 70 residents, some staff have it too and go home at night. Their children go to school. Once we get a critical mass where you don\u2019t even know if you got it on public transportation or the daycare worker it can infect more than hospitals can handle so more deaths. ",

Ebola was a surprise , aids was a surprise and many people had to die before we found the answers needed to control them. The Spanish Flu was a pandemic of epic proportions in the early 1900s that killed hundreds of thousands of people all over the world. It is hard to conceive of a disease that would be transmitted and kill 30 million people in six months. I feel such a pandemic would have to be man made and it\u2019s transmission would be extremely simple. I would look to those countries who are still doing covert biological weapons research or financing such research to be the source of such a pandemic. The United States has already had previews of such disasters and stopped them. The idea itself has not died out. I have not heard of any attempts in European countries but I believe the radon bombings and car bombs are just a diversion. ",

            "answer_text": "Having a healthcare system that has a lot of misallocated resources and less slack in the system would make a pandemic worse. The number of uninsured people as well as the incentive structure from the payment side of our healthcare system indirectly makes the system more fragile to any large shock. A pandemic would be such a large shock. However, the processes and resources that would be deployed in the event of a pandemic have only partial overlap with day-to-day operations. That means that during any pandemic, having insurance or not will be the least of your problems. A true global pandemic above some level of severity will result in failures in some of the other systems that enable civilization to continue, but no one will have billing for the disaster at the top of their list of action items.

Having an advanced medical system, it is unlikely the full force of such a pandemic would hit the US. The majority of the deaths would probably occur in less developed countries. In the US, national authorities would probably handle epidemic victims regardless of insurance. The problems of lack of medical insurance are not with contagious diseases but with the myriad other ways in which the human body can go wrong. ",
