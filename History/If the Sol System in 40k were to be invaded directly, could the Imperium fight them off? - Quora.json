            "answer_text": "The Solar system is maybe the best-defended system in the Imperium, Cadia used to hold second place. \u201cWhat makes Sol so well defended?\u201d I hear you ask, and there are several reasons why: The Battlefleet Solar, Mars, Terra and more.   First, let us look at Mars, the Forge world to end all forge worlds, the single greatest producer of weapons, armour, and vehicles of war. The Iron Ring around the planet is the largest shipyard in the Imperium, so add Void Craft to the list as well. On top of that, it is the original forge world, the one the rest obeys, if somewhat reluctantly. It is not entirely wrong to say the Adeptus Mechanicus is lead from Mars. As the oldest Forge, they also have some of the oldest and scariest gear in the Imperium.  Secondly, we have Titan, home to the Grey Knights, chamber militant of the Ordo Malleus, and dedicated deamon slayers. A secret chapter of all psyker space marines with well above average gear. Seriously though, power weapons are standard for these guys, and each suit of power armour is custom made to the marine, luxuries afforded by having their private forge world, Phobos, former \u201cmoon\u201d of Mars, moved into orbit around Titan.   And now for the single most important world in the Imperium of Man: Holy Terra, home to the Emperor, the Golden Throne, and the Astronomicon. Firstly the Astronomicon: the massive psychic lighthouse that lets mankind travel through the warp. For the Throne the writers have sometimes been disagreeing, some say there is a fault in the Throne itself, and if it is not kept stable bad things happen, others say it is the only thing keeping Eternity Gate, the Imperial webway gate from unleashing the bowels of the warp from within the Imperial Palace, resulting in bad stuff. Bad stuff here means a new eye of Terror with Terra at its centre. The Emperor might be dead, but it is of little concern, as his corpse is merely an anchor for his soul, and he is still powerful enough to keep the dark gods at bay, while also being a symbol for the entirety of the Imperium to rally behind, truly the Emperor protects. Also, the writers have had different opinions on whether Big E is still keeping the Throne stable, or if that is just the 1000 daily psykers, or maybe both.   We\u2019re not done with Terra yet, as it is also home to the Officio Assassinorum, the Imperial Fists chapter, and the Emperors personal bodyguard: The Adeptus Custodes. The various assassin temples are seated on Terra and offer a variety of scary badasses, Culexus operatives specialising in psyker removal, Eversors specialized in no survivors and clear message sending, Callidius for sneaky stabbing, and Vindicares for removal of Space Marines hiding inside Land Raiders at maximum range. The Imperial Fists aren\u2019t any random chapter, but rather a first founding chapter, keeping the name of the legion during the second founding, and as Dorn wasn\u2019t entirely agreeing with Guilliman and his new fantastic Codex, they can activate \u201cThe Last Wall\u201d protocol, instantly restructuring the Imperial Fists legion with all the sons of Dorn in the defence of Holy Terra.   Now for the Custodian Guard. Remember how the Astartes were given the finest arms and armour, or how the Mechanicus has all the good toys? Those were lies. The really good stuff is held by the Custodians, the 10 000 companions of the Emperor. Custom made Arumite armour is the bare minimum, they still use Contemptor Dreadnaughts, and the Guardian Spears, massive power halberds mounted with Lastrum bolters. Now Lastrum bolters are just bolters beefed up to handle Lastrum rounds, produced only by the Lastrum clan on Terra, who are outside Mechaincus jurisdiction. These are Heliothermic rounds, meaning they explode with the heat of a tiny star, instantly incinerating a target from the inside out. That is standard gear for them, and it should give you an idea of the stuff they have lying around. They are also tasked with guarding the Vaults of Terra, containing the nastiest of Dark Age creations, the ones the Emperor could not entrust to anyone else.  Finally, there is the Battlefleet Solar, the single largest battlefleet in the Imperium, tasked with protecting Sol and surrounding systems. There are plenty of battlefleets around the Imperium, the plenty around the Cadian gate, or at least there used to be, and not a single one could hope to match Solar. So what would happen if someone just went straight to the Solar System? They would find the biggest can of whoop-ass Mankind can offer. And as if the aforementioned defenders were insufficient, I probably forgot some groups, and every Imperial worth his salt will come to the defence of the Throne World. Any attacker will quickly learn how many ships, munitions, vehicles, and men the Imperium can muster. Edit: added pictures  As Tomas noted, the Sisters of Silence, the Emperor approved badass pariahs are still around. One of only two groups permitted to enter the Sanctorum Imperialis, the Emperor's throne room, the Custodians being the other. Officially disbanded during the Age of Apostasy, in M36, some were assimilated into the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, to man the Black Ships, and keep the gathered psykers from causing too much trouble. Those who didn\u2019t join the Imperial Phone Company are still acting on their Emperor given orders, although covertly. Not uncommon to find in Inquisitorial retinues. It is fair to assume they have a sizable force on Terra, or their old HQ on Luna, at all times to keep the psykers safe, both from themselves, and Terra at large. In a fight, these power armoured Femme Fatales are as deadly as can be, and they truly shine against psykers and daemons, and with the Cicatrix Maledictum spewing out enough warp energies for daemons to manifest anywhere, at any time, they might find themselves accepted with open arms once more.

            "answer_text": "This has happened during the Horus Heresy, so yes, or rather maybe because at least some of the tech they have to defend it must be broken now and all loyalist primarchs save Guilliman (probably actually Alpharius) are gone/dead. It depends on the level of the attack. They could probably fight of everything apart from: chaos that has teleported there, mass tyrannid invasion that has teleported directly there, all the galaxy's orks that have teleported there. The outcome of this would be uncertain. The reason that I say teleported is because of all the systems around Sol which act as barriers to invasion. Since there are so many and they gradually get more and more heavily defended, then an invasion through all of them would be practically impossible. In fact, Horus only managed to get to Terra because he tricked everyone. ",
