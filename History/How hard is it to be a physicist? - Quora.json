            "answer_text": "Personally, I think it is very hard to be a physicist. As others have pointed out, it is very hard to become a physicist. The work required to succeed through college and graduate school is immense. The competition to find jobs, from post doctoral positions on, is very intense. There are very few jobs and many applicants. The politics involved in academia is notorious and well deserves its reputation. Also, the hours are very long and the pay is very small. (Just surviving on a physicist\u2019s salary is hard!) And if all the above weren\u2019t enough, then there is also the material itself. The problems to be solved, both in theoretical and experimental physics, are very difficult. If they were easy then someone would have solved them already! And I have found that even if I find a particularly elegant solution to a problem, one that is original and conceptually clear and seems simple in hindsight, then it is only after a long struggle that was required to find a perspective that yielded the elegant solution. (This may be an American perspective. I remember a scene in Stanislaw Ulam\u2019s \u201cAdventures of a Mathematician\u201d in which he is describing his initial impressions of American physicists and mathematicians when he first came to the States. He describes finding it charming that Americans liked to advertise how hard they worked, while European physicists and mathematicians liked to pretend that everything came to them easily and hide just how hard they were actually working in the background.) None of this is any attempt to claim that being a physicist is harder than any other career choice. I have known musicians, writers, biochemists, etc, who worked as hard if not harder than I do. Hell, I am sure that migrant farm workers work much harder than I ever have. But for all of this I love physics and math, and I don\u2019t at all regret the years I put into them. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing is hard nor it required any degree like! Sir Issac Newton (be respectful use title they're not your friends) if are ambitious and determined to know the secrets of this universe, Universe will hug you and will show you it's epic mysteries it will diffuse your daily random thoughts into your dreams of subconscious mind like! Sir Einstein pamper nature feel the beauty see visualise and things in terms of energy, matter and vibration like! Sir Nicola Tesla and ask more and more questions whether they're answered or not answered, if answered prove them yourself don't just accept because any great man has achieved it. Drive the equations of phenomenons in physics, yeah! you can like! Sir Ramanujan. Be kind and loving, curious towards nature like! A child (after all every scientist has a child heart). Write your daily observations (don't be oversmart to segregate your internal suggestions from Nature's suggestions they both are couples) oh yeah! you need motivation? Just lift up your eyes on the space above your head the whole space you see through now in your eyes it\u2026now keep watching daily.. Physicists are also human who has the never ending never satisfied curiosity and questioning ability\u2026. I'm just a 12th grade as much I've understand physics it was not that physics the school teaches us because they also don't know what's physics is really and there's nothing bad physics is a never ending ocean and mathematics is your boat (again mathematics is your boat) I'm still on Journey from Quarks to Quasars! And you?\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u2026. \u2026.. \u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026.. \u2026\u2026.. \u2026\u2026\u2026. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.
