            "answer_text": "We shall examine a snapshot of history, let\u2019s take 1981 as the height of Soviet power. I am going to focus entirely on military power to limit the scope of the answer as well. But I acknowledge that economic, intelligence and political power also were factors. This took 3 hours to write, so I hope you enjoy. tl;dr Summary: In 1981, at the height of Soviet power, the Soviets were not just a little more powerful than the US, they were tremendously more powerful than the US. They outnumbered them and generally had more and better equipment too. The difference in conventional power between the Soviet Union and the second strongest power in the world at the time, might be the greatest of any point in human history. In my opinion the Soviets operated relative to their time, the single most powerful military force ever. Below I give some examples, but you\u2019re welcome to ask questions about further equipment or anything else, you might think is important to the military power balance. NATO and Warsaw Pact:  Above you see a US estimate from \u201cbalance of power in Europe 1981\u201d. In terms of conventional forces the US estimated that the Warsaw Pact had more of everything, particularly tanks. The graph does show they lacked helicopters, which is a little confusing. It could be a lack of intelligence, bu the Mi-8 is the most produced helicopter of all time, certainly more than 1,000 were in service. It is possible that many transport helicopters were not counted because they were in a special service. I do not know. For short range nuclear weapons also please note, that the low yield and almost useless nuclear artillery makes up the majority of NATO short range options, while the Soviets outnumber them 6 to 1 in tactical missiles. US and Soviet Numbers:  As you can see, the Soviets also had more ICBMs, more SLBMs as well as more than twice as many ballistic missile submarines. Effectively having 23% more operational delivery systems than the US, while also having a smaller proportion of outdated bombers compared to missiles. You might also notice that the Soviets had way more nuclear weapons in their ICBMs while the US had many nuclear weapons for planes and short range missiles. Way more than their delivery systems could carry. Perhaps most alarmingly to the US, the Soviets had 10 times as many interceptors and a nation wide missile defence system. The US had nothing. And I think that\u2019s enough about nuclear weapons. Land forces: The red highlights points out the difference in fielded manpower. For every US front-line armour division, the Soviets had 6.25, for every US mechanized division the Soviets had 8.3. The overall ratio of front-line divisions were 5.1 to 1 in favour of the Soviets. That includes the fact that 4 US divisions were leg-infantry, which means they had not armoured vehicles. The US only had 8 reserve divisions, while the Soviets had 91. Counting these the ratio was 7.3 to 1 in favour of the Soviets. Naval Forces:  As you can see, the Soviet navy was by no means small. They had a different doctrine than the US and emphasized missile ships with very long range and extremely capable missiles. Soviets missiles were often supersonic and had devastating shaped charge warheads that could shoot straight through a ship. They had several hunted corvettes and patrol ships that carried between 2 and 6 cruise missiles each several times more powerful than the harpoon used by the US. The Soviet naval arm also had over 1,000 aircraft amongst them 600 bombers including Tu-22M, a capable long range and supersonic bomber armed with cruise missiles. The entire US navy operated just 700 fighter-bomber aircraft. The US Navy had no proper air launched anti ship missiles at all. And their best aircraft like the F-14 Tomcat, had little to no anti-surface capabilities. So the US aircraft carriers in 1981 would have been of extremely limited value in a ship fight where cruise missiles were fired at ranges over 300 kilometres, as US aircraft would have to get within visual range to drop conventional bombs. Air forces:  As you can see, in the air force department the US was also heavily outnumbered. Most US aircraft were still the F-4 phantom, with the F-15 and F-16 only having been introduced a few years earlier. The Soviets mostly relied on the MiG-23 fighter at this time. But also had the outstanding MiG-31 which was unmatched at the time and capable of engaging targets beyond the range of any other aircraft at the time. The F-15 however was qualitatively the best aircraft for short range fighting, and Soviet MiG-29s and Su-27s were not yet fielded. However, the Soviet advantage in air force was further increased by their large anit aircraft missile network. The Soviets fielded mobile long range missile complexes, like the S-300 which is still feared even today. While the US had no mobile long range missiles at all, and even very weak close range AA missile support in general. Equipment Ratio: The Soviets out numbered the US in practically every aspect, and in many import aspects they outnumbered the US several to one. But we haven\u2019t talked about the equipment ratio here. You might have noticed the Warsaw Pact didn\u2019t have that many more troops than NATO. But they had way more equipment. This basically means that the Soviet troops were not only more numerous but they were also much better equipped. With NATO having 1 tank for every 200 personal. The Soviets had one for every 94 personal. That means that way more soviet personal were armoured troops, compared to NATO having larger proportion of basic infantry. The same is true for artillery, anti tank weapons and armoured personal carriers. In the Soviet army every single frontline division could expect to have 100% mechanization, no one had to walk and everyone drove in armoured vehicles. The Soviets also had armed infantry fighting vehicles, which almost no one else had. The US could not maintain 100% mechanization despite having a much smaller army. And no one else in NATO came close to the US. Below you\u2019ll see comparative artillery throw weights, which also illustrates how outgunned NATO was in artillery.  Quality: The red highlight above brings me to the final point of quality. There are a lot of myths of Soviet quality being bad. And maybe the finest single products were made in the west, but this doesn\u2019t matter if you make so few of them that most people can\u2019t have them anyway. In the Warsaw Pact everyone had assault rifles. But if NATO had mobilized their forces, half of their armies would have gone into WW3 with WW2 rifles. Nearly all of NATO relied on old rifled cannons on their basic steel tanks. While the Soviets had well over 10,000 composite-armour-laser-equipped-autoloaded-smoothbore tanks of the types T-64, T-72 and T-80. NATO could field less than 1,000 Leopard 2, Abrams (105mm) or Challengers. I could write a whole article about the state of technology and quality. But I won\u2019t do that. Because I already did, so if you are interested in more of this ask in the comments or read How did Soviet and US military technology compare?

            "answer_text": "President Kennedy once said that the United States possessed a nuclear missile capability to destroy the Soviet Union twice, while the Soviet Union had enough nuclear weapons to destroy the United States only once ... To which Khrushchev replied that the Soviet Union had enough and this ... \" The Soviet Union was one of two states that considered the world superpowers.With the Second World War, the USSR was able to compete and often outstrip the US in a number of sectors. Particular mention should be made of his participation in the race the USSR could rapidly catch up with the nuclear potential of the US In any case, a nuclear war with the Soviet Union could have ended badly for all participants. In the space race of the USSR, the first artificial earth satellite was launched into orbit, and then the world's first man, Yuri Gagarin other areas of the USSR, he was also often among the first in the world, eventually eventually overtaking the Apollo mission, but it was damn close.   In response to the creation of the NATO bloc, the USSR created its military bloc of eight countries - the Warsaw Pact. The number of the Warsaw Pact military exceeded the number of NATO troops. The economy of the USSR was probably our greatest material weakness, although it was not immediately obvious. We had a lot of natural resources because of the huge size of Russia, that is, we could extract our oil and rare metals. Like the United States, we sent significant material assistance to our allies, both in military equipment and in financial support. Investments in the advanced fields of science and technology were inadequate in the USSR. As a result, there is a tendency to lag behind the United States. The political system of the Soviet Union was a big problem. The aging group of the political elite held power, but were often ineffective leaders, and the command economy created more problems than it helped the development of society. Gorbachev tried to remedy this, but no reforms could help, which led to the final collapse of the state. At present, Russia has drawn certain conclusions from the impasse of the development of socialist society. Now Russia is building the same capitalism as it is in the whole world. It certainly has its own characteristics and our Russian mentality. The main principle of the country is independence from the influence and desires of our rivals in the international arena. We are not used to conceding our sovereignty to anyone. At the same time, we try not to show aggression, although in many cases we have to use force. Russia has a great potential for development. We have tried to significantly strengthen and even significantly advance in the field of modern weapons for the sole purpose that we would not simply be distracted from our development as a guarantor of peace and peaceful coexistence.

            "answer_text": "+ As the USSR, Russia was the one country that could produce war-equipment more cheaply than other nations. That included rockets too. A look then at a Russian factory, most city streets, Russian housing, how Russians dressed, what they had to eat and at what prices, showed that most Russians were not doing well. only roughly 10% were party-members. Ten percent of those or 1% were rather well off. (10% x 10% = 1%) Russia was a country where the top 1% was reality. Moscow\u2019s subways were incongruously palatial. A look at Russia\u2019s armed services then showed where most resources went. Russia launched Sputnik on 1957 Oct 04 and gave US leaders a heart attack. The US sped up its program to launch its satellite on 1958 Jan 31. Yuri Gagarin was 1st man to orbit Earth on 1961 Apr 12. Alan Shepard rode into space on 61 May 05. John Glenn was 2d man to orbit Earth on 1962 Feb 20. My guess is that at its height the USSR was one-fourth as powerful as the US. Yet, in military strength, the USSR was maybe something like 60% as powerful. But what do I know? Former Soviet citizens I knew in the 1960s said Russia\u2019s strength was way over-estimated. I suspect our intelligence services played a role that game so as to keep our Congress funding what for us was a huge defence budget. Russia\u2019s KGB was huge like our CIA, but far abler. From 1968 to 1985 Russia had a direct channel to US crypto thanks to the Walker spy ring. During WWII, which the Allies won, the Allies had cracked Japanese and German crypto. Had the US gone to war with the USSR between 1968 and 1985, it would likely have lost. But the key element enabling the American Colonies to win independence from Gt Britain, was Geo Washington\u2019s superior intelligence service. Russia\u2019s GDP today should give some idea of Russia\u2019s strength. Russia\u2019s GDP is $1.3-trillion. USA GDP is $18.7-trillion. The 1st figure is an estimate, but the 2d figure is a more accurate estimate plus-or-minus 0.5%. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s really hard to answer that as it gradually emerged how much disinformation was put out by the Soviets, intelligence services all over the world, naive or corrupted journalists and diplomats all over the world from 1919\u20131989, and the use of proxies from Soviet client states to project power in most countries while usually posing as completely local movements. Soviet military equipment eventually was rugged but lacked quality control in manufacturing, eventually far behind in electronics and sensors, poorly maintained so vast amounts of it were inoperable or short-lived but we didn\u2019t realize that, and in many places and times, mostly obsolete and lacking replacement parts and substantial local repair/servicing capacity. The Soviet military was drawn from the many diverse Soviet republics, let alone it\u2019s allies (Cubans, Poles, Bulgarians, Romanians, etc.) so not only great cultural differences but units with too many different languages were the norm while wildly varying levels of education and experience with technology made it even worse. Officers and non-commissioned officers were brutal to their men, often stole from them or diverted resources to the officers\u2019 personal benefit, unevenly trained, ruled by fear with political correctness officers able to remove them instantly in every unit (political commissars) and considering too many soldiers as cannon fodder destroys morale. Alcohol abuse to the point of alcoholism and chronic drunkeness while at work was extremely high and that interferes with everything from safety to breaking stuff. When Kennedy ran in 1960, a key assertion was a \u201cmissile gap\u201d that presumed the Soviets had produced and put in the field far more nuclear weapons ready to be delivered than the U.S.. No one could admit that U.S. nuclear production and delivery systems were way behind schedule and a mess but the Soviet estimate turned out to be vastly overblown. Former Nazi intelligence network in the Soviet Union, the Gehlen Organization, was hired at the end of World War II by U.S. intelligence to keep watching the Soviets but apparently it took until 1969 when the contract ended to realize Nazi war criminals only protected from prosecution by spying on the Soviets might greatly exaggerate the threat to keep their jobs and their heads. To a great extent the Soviets were a paper tiger despite, reportedly, vast numbers of troops and tanks (that they couldn\u2019t readily transport very far so fighting had to be on or in Soviet territory making it primarily a defensive force.)

            "answer_text": "H-m-mm\u2026 It seems some questions were merged here occasionally\u2026 I was originally requested to share my opinion on \u201cIn what ways was the Soviet Union superior to the United States?\u201d Well\u2026 The folks of USSR ( in particular, those of Russia and Ukraine ) have a long-standing history on their native territories. The territories were ( and these are still being ) unbelievable rich in natural resources, so to make their life there \u201cRussian people\u201d historically did not need to develop sophisticated technologies ( e.q. in agriculture ). For so-called \u201cordinal Russians\u201d there was no reason to fight for resources known as \u201clebensraum\u201d, and as a result, there was not a need in a strong \u201cfederal\u201d government or participate in aggressive actions against neighbors. For example, in many generations \u201cordinal Russians\u201d in Siberia were able making their lives locally, paying not too much attention to what is going on in [ the politic of ] their capital cities in the European part of the country. The governments, in contrast ( since the time of Peter the Great ) wanted to conquer developed and strategically important foreign territories and grab technologies in order to dominate in Europe, Asia, and then at the world stages. Normally the peaceful \u201cordinal Russians\u201d were forced or mobilized to support the government ambitions and fights against their will. However, in case of a real danger for their Motherland ( i.e. the war against Nazi during the WWII ) Russians were able to pay a lot to crush the aggressors, while that is important to highlight here, that in these fights Russians were fighting not for their current government ( i.e. Nicholas II ( Romanov ), or Iosif Stalin ), but for their country. But the Russian/Soviet governments were able to use this mentality to reach their own goals. Let me present a citation from one of Soviet time\u2019s movies ( Zerograd (1988) ), these lines belong to a state-man character, explaining the government men\u2019s approach to the history: Since the time of the Tatar-Mongol invasion, the main idea that unites us all [ i.e. \u201cRussians\u201d ], the idea that generations of our ancestors served, is the idea of strong statehood... A powerful, great state is that ideal for which a Russian person is ready to suffer, is ready to endure any deprivations, ready, finally, sacrifice the life... This is an irrational idea. This is not the pragmatic European desire to make the most out of yourself, it is the idea of the Russian spirit that subordinates and dissolves in itself your, my individuality, but in exchange for you and me it gives a hundred times more; gives a sense of belonging to the great body, gives a sense of spirit, gives a sense of strength and immortality. The West has always sought to compromise the idea of our statehood, but the greatest danger to our idea lies not in the West, but in ourselves; this we ourselves grab all these endless fashionable Western ideas, being tempted by their obvious practicality, rationality, without realizing at the same time that this is precisely what is their destructive power for us. But there is nothing to worry about that, our own idea in the long run always prevails. Look: all our revolutions ultimately led not to destruction, but to strengthening and strengthening the state\u2026 I would agree with this character\u2019s opinion, and from this point of view, both USSR and Russia could be tagged as a superior country.

            "answer_text": "In measuring the relative power of both superpowers its important to take into account what we mean by power. I assume you are referring to material power (size of military, size of economy, population etc\u2026). The truth is - as many here have noted - the USSR was never as powerful as it seemed during the Cold War. Its achievements are notable - particularly in military technology and space exploration, however these successes masked a number of severe deficiencies in the Soviet system. The Cold War was in many ways the worst thing that could have happened to the Soviet Union. It entailed massive over-investment in the military sector of the economy - particularly from the 1970s onward. Such over-investment was masked by the high price of petroleum during the 1970s, but when the price of oil plummeted in the 1980s the rot at the heart of the Soviet system was exposed. So, although we might argue that in conventional military terms the USSR reached its \u2018apex\u2019 sometime during the 1970s \u2018detente\u2019 era (particularly with the massive expansion of its navy), this level of military power was unsustainable over the medium-to-long term. The economic dynamism of the USA, Canada, Western Europe and Japan during the same period, and their collective transition to a flexible, consumer-driven, service-oriented, economic model (that was impossible to replicate within the context of Soviet-style, top-down, communism), entailed that even with the achievement of nuclear and conventional parity, the USSR was going to struggle to maintain the strategic status quo ante over the long term.

            "answer_text": "These analysis are fine if one believes that having more men, tanks and equipment otherwise known as \u2018conventional\u2019 military forces, makes a country a super power. However, if one understands and agrees that any conflict between these two powers, was not\u2026going to be conventional. If nukes ever got involved, ALL of those conventional forces\u2026mean nothing. Plus, simply using the word \u2018powerful\u2019 allows an analysis to include allies and economic success. Therefore it is my opinion and I am not alone, the agreement consummated by J. Carter to actually place INF (intermediate nuke force) on the ground in NATO countries was the single most important factor in ending the cold war. Yes, SDI (strategic defense initiative) often called \u2018Star Wars\u2019 defense also struck nervousness if not some fear in the military directorate of the USSR. But those missiles in Europe was a fact, staring them in the face. ",

Education was in vogue, educated people were respected (you\u2019d never hear abuse of academics the way you hear it in the West), people read books, serious literature and went to theatres and museums. Even people from far-away villages would know at least a little Pushkin or Tolstoy. That I think is one of the things that shocked people who left for the West: how relatively few people there were equally cultured. This is because the Soviet system of values was based round work and self-improvement, not around money and self-enrichment. If you are a materialist, why would you need to read Pushkin? It won\u2019t make you any money. Children would dream of being engineers and astronauts, not entrepreneurs or reality TV stars. They would dream of doing jobs that were useful and contributory to society, not ones that would make them the most money. ",
