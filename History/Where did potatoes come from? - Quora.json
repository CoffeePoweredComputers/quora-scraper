            "answer_text": "The origin of potatoes is as amazing as the potato itself. Bigger is Better Although around St. Patrick\u2019s Day, you would think potatoes all come from Ireland, they are actually American in origin. Peru in South America, more specifically. The best historical information is that they started being used there about 7,000 years ago. They got very popular in Chile before the Spanish Conquest of the Americas. Of course, as with anything to do with humans, they were selected for size and the tubers got bigger and bigger. Since they grow at the bottom of the plant (the root area) rather than the top of the plant, they have some particular advantages when being cultivated. Although they do produce seeds, most potatoes are grown from the \u201ceyes\u201d of other potatoes. By planting a potato eye, you end up getting a clone of the original potato. On the other hand, growing potatoes from seeds throws in the randomness you get from pollination - maybe you get something better, maybe you get something worse. Why take a chance while planting when you can just send in the clones and know exactly what to expect? The Spanish took potatoes back to Europe where they spread like crazy around the 16th Century. The potato, with its packed nutrition and calories, is credited for a huge population boom in Europe up through the early 20th Century. Potatoes were perceived as food for animals and, when consumed by humans, as a low-class food like oats. The upper classes had no idea what they were missing. Just ask the lobster if what was once perceived as a low-class food is bad food. The potatoes that stayed behind in the Americas kept their colors and diversity in various cultivars (ever seen a purple potato? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite beautiful). Like any food, though, it\u2019s what you do with the ingredient that makes all the difference. Check out some good potato recipes you can find in cookbooks and on the Internet like at this blog http://trythisnewrecipe.blogspot.com/. Europe got so dependent upon the potato to feed the masses that it became a staple food and helped reshape European civilization. Vincent van Gogh even got in the act with his famous Potato Eaters oil painting in 1885. Potato Boom to Potato Bust As with most booms, you know what happens next - disaster. In this case a potato disaster. The Great Potato Famine occurred in the 1850s and hit countries that had come to rely on the potato pretty hard. The late blight caused potato crops to fail and all of a sudden, the masses were starving. The ability to clone potatoes led, in part, to catastrophe - there was little genetic diversity in the crop and the blight took advantage of that, certainly better than the poor humans did. Nowhere was hit harder than Ireland and so, rather than stay with their failed crops, many people immigrated to the United States. From \u201cSend In The Clones\u201d\u009d to \u201cSend In The Clowns\u201d - Ronald McDonald Although you may have noticed more diversity in supermarket potatoes recently with the reintroduction of various cultivars and fingerling potatoes, it was a man named Luther Burbank who developed the potato that has become the \u201cgold standard of potatoes\u201d\u009d (if there really is such a thing). Luther was inspired to defeat the blight and bred a potato that would save those suffering from famine. He was sure that his Russet Burbank potato would do the trick. It worked. Mostly. The Russet-Burbank he developed has been so successful that it is the most commonly grown potato today, thanks especially to fast food restaurants starting in the 1950s. They need potatoes that can take a lot of abuse but still make great french fries. Care to guess which potato variety most fast food restaurants, including McDonalds, buy in huge quantities even up until today? By the way, Luther Burbank never received a patent on his tater because plants grown from tubers are not patentable under U.S. patent law. Burbank\u2019s potato was a success but only after most of the damage had been done and most immigrants affected by the famine had already left for the United States. Being at the bottom rung on the social ladder meant the Irish in the U.S. became a proud ethnic group and worked hard to make their mark on American life. One way that worked its way into modern day culture is St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which is not celebrated in Ireland at all like it is in the United States - St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations with its parades, green beer and, of course, potato dishes.

            "answer_text": "Potato - Wikipedia The potato is a root vegetable native to the Americas, a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum, and the plant itself, a perennial in the family Solanaceae. Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas, from the United States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000\u201310,000 years ago. In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated. Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice. Following millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 1,000 different types of potatoes. Over 99% of presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile, which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the Andes. The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2014. Being a nightshade similar to tomatoes, the vegetative and fruiting parts of the potato contain the toxin solanine and are not fit for human consumption. Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in amounts small enough to be negligible to human health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.

            "answer_text": "The wild potato is a masterpiece of evolution. Botanists have discovered 169 species of them, widely dispersed across the Americas, but primarily located in the Andes. Wild spuds have been able to adapt to every type of ecosystem except for lowland tropical rainforest. Their foliage is bitter with toxic glycoalkaloid compounds that promptly spoil the appetite of hungry leaf munchers (or kills them). Beneath the ground, small tubers grow on the roots, in a wide variety of colors and shapes. The toxic tubers store energy and moisture as insurance against unfavorable conditions. As they mature, the plants flower, and then produce tomato-like fruits containing up to 200 seeds. Because the seeds are the result of sexual reproduction, each one is genetically unique. Some will be resistant to frost, and/or drought, and/or blight. Wherever they happen to grow, plants having the most suitable genes for local conditions will be the most likely to thrive and reproduce. Diverse genes are essential for a species long-term survival. Wild spuds are not the slightest bit interested in sprawling agribusiness monocultures, cancerous civilizations, population explosions, fungicide industries, or topsoil destruction. They simply find ways to blend into their ecosystem, live well, and not rock the boat, like all proper and dignified organisms do. After consuming several tons of domesticated spuds over many decades, John Reader was inspired to write Potato, a highly readable book that described the amazing success of the humble spud, and the astonishing unintended consequences. It adds one more chapter to the ongoing comedy of backfiring human cleverness. Nobody has come up with a compelling explanation for why humans domesticated toxic little tubers, but we did. Some of the myriad mutants resulting from wild potato sex must have produced tubers with low toxicity that tickled the imagination of somewhat-clever minds. Domesticated tubers are much larger than wild ones, and much better tasting. When the plants stop growing, and the foliage withers, the tubers are no longer poisonous. An acre of spuds can produce as much food as eight acres of wheat \u2014 in much less time. Spuds are now our fourth most common food, following wheat, corn, and rice. They are remarkably nutritious. You can eat nothing but spuds for several months and remain healthy. If you add a glass of milk to every meal, you will be completely nourished \u2014 this was the Irish peasant\u2019s diet 200 years ago. The average adult male ate 10 pounds of spuds daily, and 20 when working hard. Seriously! Potatoes can thrive where grains don\u2019t, and they can be stored for months. Long ago, the people of the Andes learned how to make chu\u00f1o \u2014 freeze-dried potatoes, which can be stored for years, while losing no nutritional value. Sweet potatoes are not related to potatoes, and they spoil far more quickly. Prior to the arrival of potatoes, European peasants were typically malnourished and short-lived. But spud-gobbling bumpkins were more healthy and vigorous, despite their extreme poverty. Potato-fed kids were more likely to survive into adulthood and reproduce. Infants could be weaned earlier by switching them to a mix of mashed potatoes and buttermilk, allowing mom to get pregnant again sooner, and have more children. When potatoes arrived in Ireland around 1600, the population was no more than 1.5 million. By 1845, it was 8.5 million, of which 90 percent were hardcore spud addicts. This explosive growth could not continue, of course. I shall now introduce the arch villain in this story: Phytophthora infestans, a fungus commonly referred to as \u201clate blight.\u201d It probably originated in the highlands of central Mexico, and then migrated to other regions. Today it can be found almost everywhere, and wet weather is its call to action. Blight spores can ride the winds to new locations. Nothing gives it greater pleasure than discovering a big field of moist mature potato plants. In 1845, spores from the US took a steam ship cruise to Ireland, where everyone was eagerly expecting a bumper crop of lumpers. To their horror, entire fields turned black overnight. Blight raced across Europe, destroying two million square kilometers in four months. It struck again in 1846 and 1848. Ireland was hit hardest, and their wretched British overlords could not be bothered to provide much assistance. A million Irish died, and a million emigrated. I shall now introduce the hapless victim in this story: Solanum tuberosum, the family of domesticated taters. In the process of being transformed from wild toxic tubers to an incredibly productive super food, domestic spuds lost most of their sex drive (via male sterility). Few produce any fruits or seeds. So, commercial American potatoes are not grown from \u201ctrue seeds.\u201d Instead, farmers plant \u201cseed tubers,\u201d which are hunks of tubers from the last harvest. True seeds are rugged survivalists, because they are genetically diverse. But domesticated potatoes are helpless sitting ducks, because they are genetically identical clones. If one is susceptible to blight, they all are. Reader says, \u201cIn fact, most modern cultivars are biological \u2018monsters\u2019 that could not survive in the wild.\u201d They can\u2019t live without human caretakers (like domesticated dogs, cattle, sheep, and maize). Scientists have two control options. The cheapest solution is to breed new varieties that are blight resistant, but this is a time-consuming process, and there are only a limited number of gene tricks that work. The success of any new variety can only be temporary, because the blight fungus is constantly mutating. Blight will inevitably create offspring that can overcome the resistant spud\u2019s defenses, and each new blight spore can produce 100,000 spores in four days. The scientists will have to start all over again. The other solution is more expensive and toxic: fungicides. In wet seasons, a field might be sprayed 12 times (or 30 times in super-moist New Guinea). Like plant breeding, the effectiveness of fungicides is temporary, because the fungus will inevitably develop resistance to them. When one poison stops working, you switch to another, use more, or try combos. There can be no permanent solution to blight. Scientists will run out of clever tricks long before Mother Nature quits producing countless new fungus mutants every minute. Rising energy costs will continue to drive up the price of fungicides, making them unaffordable for a growing number of poor farmers. Wild spuds still thrive in the high Andes, preserving the wild gene pool that\u2019s essential to the work of plant breeders. Blight has never been a problem in this region \u2014 until recently. Climate change has been making the weather warmer and wetter in the homeland of spuds. Some crops of native potatoes have been heavily damaged. The venerable historian William H. McNeill once penned an essay titled \u201cHow the Potato Changed the World's History.\u201d Europe\u2019s population skyrocketed between 1750 and 1900, thanks in part to the spud. Millions of surplus country folks were forced to move to cities, work in factories, earn peanuts, and live on taters. Thus, spuds played a significant role in the mass emigration of Europeans, the growth of colonial empires, and the rise of Russia and Germany as industrial powers.

If you want to know how the supermarket got the potatoes, I think they buy them from farmers who apparently grow them and then dig them up from the soil. If you trace back the appearance of the potato we eventually get back to somewhere in S America where the native grew it, even produced dehydrated forms of (e.g. the equivalent of mash potato). The European invader settlers to South America sent potatoes back to Europe and from there over a period of time it spread to most parts of the world. ",
