            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A As others are bound to state, there is no objectively right or wrong answer to a question like this one. Which presidents find their way onto these lists depends highly on the political ideology of the one ranking them and their knowledge of history. With that out of the way, here are the top five presidents from the perspective of someone who is conservative on fiscal issues, but liberal on most social ones. George Washington (1789\u20131797) (Independent): The man who created the job gets the top spot. All future presidents had previous examples to draw upon in making policies, Washington had none. Most of his contemporaries were monarchs (King George III) or despots (Robespierre), not democratic leaders. Despite all this, Washington managed to act responsibly and set the standard that all future presidents would follow. In his time in office, Washington defined the role of a president's cabinet as a group of advisors rather than a group of yes-men. He managed to put down the Whiskey rebellion without resorting to a Robespierre-Esque reign of terror. He created our first national bank, the first federal storage for our nation\u2019s credit. Finally, to the surprise of many, Washington chose to step down after two terms in power, thus setting the standard that a president should not rule for life. While Washington did not want the job, he was arguably the best individual for it in our country's early history.Abraham Lincoln (1861\u20131865) (Republican): Put simply, Lincoln preserved the Union. He had to violate some civil liberties to get it done, but he led the Union to victory against the Confederacy and successfully prevented foreign powers from coming to the Confederacy's aid. He was also one of our best infrastructure presidents, being the father of our trans-continental railroad. To top it all off, Lincoln helped push the 13th amendment through Congress which had slavery banned under the constitution. Along with Washington, this choice was a rather easy and obvious one to make.Thomas Jefferson (1801\u20131809) (Democratic-Republican): Many modern scholars assert that Jefferson, while an important founding father, was a mediocre president. I happen to disagree. On the global stage, Jefferson negotiated the purchase of the Lousiana territory from France. In doing so, Jefferson increased our landmass by leaps and bounds. He also defended our traders from the Barbary Pirates by setting our Navy against them. Here at home, Jefferson had Congress pass legislation that banned American involvement in the slave trade, the first step towards getting rid of slavery entirely. He also paid down parts of our national debt and protected our first amendment rights by repealing the authoritarian Alien-Sedition acts. Jefferson had some issues, most notably his trade embargo against Great Britain drastically hurt our economy during his second term. But, for the most part, he was instrumental in the development of our country.Harry Truman (1945\u20131953) (Democratic): Coming into office upon the death of Franklin Roosevelt, few expected Truman to be a successful president. Most political analysts saw it as all but guaranteed that Truman would be a one-termer. But in the end, Truman proved everyone wrong. On the global stage, Truman ended the second world war by using the atomic bomb against Japan. A controversial move, but arguably the right one as the alternative (a land invasion) probably would have killed millions more on both sides. After the war\u2019s end, Truman helped put Europe back on its feet by sending it billions of dollars of aid in the form of the Marshall Plan. He followed up on this by creating NATO, the organization that effectively blocked the Soviet Union from invading Europe for the next four and a half decades. Similarly, Truman had the United Nations assemble a military coalition to defend South Korea when North Korea and Communist China invaded it. Finally, to add to all of this, Truman was the first president of the Democratic party to support rights for racial minorities. He did this by announcing a pro-civil rights platform during his 1948 re-election bid and by desegregating the military. While unpopular in his day, history has shown Truman to have been a wise leader during dangerous and tumultuous times.Dwight Eisenhower (1953\u20131961) (Republican): Widely beloved in his day, Eisenhower is a president whose reputation seems to be getting better and better as time passes. In economic matters, Ike spearheaded the creation of our nation\u2019s interstate highway system and worked with Congress to balance the nation\u2019s budget on three separate occasions. On the global stage, he ended American involvement in the Korean war and negotiated a fragile peace between both North and South Korea. After this, Eisenhower strengthened Truman\u2019s NATO and defused several international crises that very easily could have led to war. He also entered the United States into the space race with the creation of NASA. Finally, in social affairs, Eisenhower attempted to fight racial discrimination with the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and had the military enforce the desegregation of public schools in the south. A competent, level headed individual who gave us the peace and prosperity of the 1950s.Ulysses Grant (1869\u20131877) (Republican): While Lincoln was the president that abolished slavery, Grant was the first one to champion the cause of racial minorities. He worked with Congress to pass the landmark Civil rights act of 1875, and he got them to ratify the 15th amendment. The latter was what gave African Americans voting rights, and the former was an early attempt at banning racial discrimination in public facilities. Alongside these victories in Civil rights, Grant also eradicated the first iteration of the Ku Klux Klan. He did so by having the military venture into the deep south and arrest every Klan member that they could find. The Klan would not re-emerge for another forty years. In economics, Grant was fiscally responsible. He paid down 1/5 of the national debt and vetoed a Congressional bill that sought to hike inflation. Concerning our Justice system, Grant did his best to strengthen it. First, by establishing our federal justice department, and second, by making an early attempt at civil service reform. With all of these accomplishments, Grant was a much better president than his reputation would suggest. He might have even made it into the top five, had it not been for the corruption of some of his subordinates.So there\u2019s my top six list. I originally intended for this list to only feature five presidents. But, I ended up including Grant, because I consider him to be very close to the top five in terms of quality. Again though, as I stated earlier, I do not intend for this to be an objective list. It only represents my personal opinion, and other lists will probably see different inclusions. ",

            "answer_text": "In brutal honesty, this question will generate many of the same answers. Almost everyone will include George Washington, FDR, Abe Lincoln, and a few other well-known and well-recorded presidents. The truth is, however, that some of the presidents that created major turning points in history weren\u2019t the best (or were even the worst) presidents in history. My answer is going to be a lists of the presidents that made or are making the most impact on our nation\u2019s history, whether positively or negatively. Most of them will show up on other lists, but some will be unexpected. These are the presidents that have shaped (or are shaping) America\u2019s domestic and global image.  10) Donald Trump  (Source: Donald Trump - Wikipedia) \u201cWAIT,\u201d you say. \u201cWhy the hell is he on this list?\u201d Because Trump changed the political game. The election for the 45th presidency will go down in history as a landmark election due to his populist platform and style of campaigning. Trump managed to merge and exploit the power of social media and rhetoric. By tapping into common discontent and utilizing easily accessible media, Trump was able to convince just enough of the right people to vote for him. In the future, I expect that political campaigns will stray further and further away from \u201ctraditional\u201d methods (such as TV advertisements and posters) and become ever more reliant on fast communications that reach individual voters. This includes political campaigns for senators and representatives as well, as evidenced by the special elections that have happened during the past year. 9) Harry S. Truman  (Image source: Harry S. Truman - Wikipedia) President Truman made many strides towards domestic progress by continuing his predecessor\u2019s agenda, but his greatest impacts were international. His policies against communism helped set the stage for the Cold War, and shaped the policies of the US for decades to come. Truman was also responsible for ushering in the nuclear age, but whether or not it was his choice to is up for debate. 8) Dwight D. Eisenhower  (Image source: Dwight D. Eisenhower - Wikipedia) In all honesty, I feel that Eisenhower deserved a higher spot on this list. Domestically, Eisenhower expanded many of the progressive policies of his Democratic predecessors (much to the chagrin of some conservative officials). He also created the Interstate Highway System, greatly easing transportation between states. Diplomatically, his continuation of Truman\u2019s policies combined with his own efforts to stop communism effectively set in stone the US stance towards the Soviet Union for the next half of a century. 7) Andrew Johnson  (Image source: Andrew Johnson - Wikipedia) Andrew Johnson is, by many metrics, one of the worst presidents of the United States. That\u2019s why he made this list. Johnson became president with the death of Abraham Lincoln. In many aspects, he was the exact opposite of what Lincoln would have wanted. He hampered Civil Rights efforts, obstructed Lincoln\u2019s plans for the rebuilding of the South, and, overall, set the basis for the creation of a \u201cSouthern Identity\u201d - defined by a nostalgia for pre-Civil War times, a glorification of Confederate heroes (including leaders such as Nathan Bedford Forrest), a hatred towards the North, open discrimination against blacks, and many other things that ultimately hampered the rebuilding of a war-torn nation. The impact of his actions (and, in some cases, lack thereof) still linger today, as evidenced by the voter discontent in predominantly white rural areas during the 2016 election. PS: this short section most definitely does not fairly portray Southern culture. It doesn\u2019t do justice to the destruction and devastation that Southern states endured after the Civil War, nor does it fairly show many of the admirable qualities of Southerners. 6) Lyndon B. Johnson  (Image source: Lyndon B. Johnson - Wikipedia) Despite his negative public image due to the increased military activity in Vietnam under his presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s \u201cGreat Society\u201d and \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d set the groundwork for many welfare programs and public services that are still used today. He also helped advance Civil Rights by signing the Voting Rights Act and bills that banned discrimination in housing, public facilities, and the workplace. Of course, one could cynically argue that LBJ was only to accomplish all of this because John F. Kennedy (who was the first to come up with these ideas) was tragically assassinated; nevertheless, President Johnson and his administration are directly responsible for many of the government services we enjoy today. 5) Thomas Jefferson  (Image source: Thomas Jefferson - Wikipedia) His most important contribution during his presidency was arguably the Louisiana purchase. The reason why I placed President Jefferson as 5th is that most of his accomplishments and contributions came before he became president. As a Founding Father, Jefferson was essential to the creation of our nation. As a president, however, he was most known for his land purchase and exploration and progressive policies to assimilate Native Indians and Americans. Internationally, he was unable to create a lasting impact. His Embargo Act is widely regarded as a failure and his Non-Intercourse Act created little to no beneficial impact. 4) Theodore Roosevelt  (Image source: Theodore Roosevelt - Wikipedia) \u201cTeddy\u201d Roosevelt had a reputation for being a badass; he was a Rough Rider, a wilderness aficionado, and, in many aspects, the epitome of manliness. Diplomatically, his namesake corollary to the Monroe Doctrine helped establish the US as an international power. This essentially became a stepping stone for US imperialism in the Americas and, later on, in Asia. Domestically, President Roosevelt was essential to economic reform that would transform an entire nation. Roosevelt, an outspoken progressive, broke up many trusts and monopolies with regulatory legislation. He oversaw the creation of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor, further limiting the abusive power of large monopolies. 3) Franklin D. Roosevelt  (Image source: Franklin D. Roosevelt - Wikipedia) President Roosevelt has much to his name: He transformed the Democratic Party, turning it from a conservative one to a progressive and liberal one.His New Deal provided relief for a nation destroyed by the Great Depression. (Granted, it took World War II for the economy to fully recover, however, FDR was still responsible for creating economic growth that definitely helped the nation rebuild.)That New Deal also provided many public services to remote rural areas; it was only because of President Roosevelt that remote towns were able to get access to electricity (See TVA)And, of course, FDR effectively led the US in World War II.2) Abraham Lincoln  (Image source: Abraham Lincoln - Wikipedia) A progressive who helped create the modern Republican party (of course, that party had a vastly different platform than today\u2019s Republican party). His leadership guided the North towards victory, and his actions galvanized a nation and set the foundation for modern Civil Rights. Among the noteworthy legislation that he created are the 13th amendment (which abolished slavery) and the Emancipation Proclamation. It is unfortunate that his plans for rebuilding the South were never realized. 1) George Washington  (Image source: George Washington - Wikipedia) Everyone recognizes Washington as the first president of the United States, but what he did often goes unnoticed. As president, Washington unified a divided nation. Prior to his presidency, there still existed sentiments that the US was a collection of united States, rather than a single, unified nation. His intervention in the Whiskey Rebellion and presence at the first Congress meetings led to the establishment of a strong federal government, backed up with a Constitution that was ratified by all the existing states. In other words, President Washington is responsible for forging the groundwork that our nation is built upon. Without him, who knows how our nation could have ended up.  So there you go. A list of the most transformative presidents of our nation. Please comment your thoughts and ideas. EDIT: switched Teddy\u2019s and Truman\u2019s positions. I really didn\u2019t give President Theodore Roosevelt the credit he truly deserves. ",
