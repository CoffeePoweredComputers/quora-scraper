            "answer_text": "Yes, once about 5\u2026.6 years ago. I was driving my wife home from an interview, and as she was dressed quite nice and elegant, more than the usual, and somehow my \u201calpha male\u201d instincts kicked in and I wanted to pass a car in front of me that was going rather slow (for a BMW that is\u2026.). So I got caught with just a little bit over the speed limit and I felt like the noobest of the noobs. I think even the policeman had a good laugh. I was caught doing 62km/h in a area where 50km/h is the limit. And in Romania, a tolerance of +/- 10km/h around the speed limit is tolerated. So if I would have managed to slow down to 59km/h, I would not have been stopped or just received a warning\u2026 And surprisingly enough, I did not get a lecture from my wife, as she clearly understood what happened to me. I keep peeking at her while driving on the way home in a way she haven\u2019t seen me doing in years. She took it as a compliment, reminded me to pay the fine within 48 hours so I could pay only half of it, and never again mentioned it. In Romania, getting a speeding ticket doesn\u2019t affect you in any way other than having to pay the fine and getting some points off. Point that will be reset if 6 months pass without any other mistake. There\u2019s no history of these events than can affect your life in any way. OK, unpaid fines can give you some troubles in the long run, but nothing that serious. And to make the situation even more clear, this happened when our first child was about two years old and my wife had finished her paid maternity leave. Those first two years were quite a struggle for us as we had a lot of health problems with our son, so we quite neglected ourselves. So, me ogling at her like I did that day and trying to act all macho (well, to the extent my behavior can be called macho\u2026) was a much needed compliment and was well received. She did not have to spell this out for me, I managed to read between the line. And yes, some 3 months later she got the job she interviewed for. I know, 3 months is a long time, but better late than never. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes many of them! My 1st one was kind of funny! I got pulled over! I was nervous as get out! The cop approaches asks to see my driver\u2019s license and registration. I hand the cop my whole wallet! He says take your driver\u2019s license out. I am going oh GoodGod really. I can\u2019t think clearly! Hand him my everything! He comes back and gives it to me and the ticket. Few days later I am on AOL chats in my city. I start talking to this person, and he said he was in public service. I said you must be this or that. He told me his name\u2026 I was like oh your the jerk who gave me a speeding ticket. He than said I should goto court. I said who has time for that. I had already paid the fine. My most recent speeding ticket was clearly me not speeding. I was coming home from the hospital with my dad. State Trooper was ahead of me and after another white vehicle. I had speed control set to 65! He drops back and pulls me over, I said can I help you? He said license and registration you were doing 85 in a 65! I looked at him like really? when he handed me the ticket and my stuff back he was gone! I couldn\u2019t ask any questions. Went to court in this county that only holds traffic court on Fridays. The line was out the building wrapped around the building! I was like great! 25,000 cases that day! I said great! We get in the court hall way waiting area. It was booked solid. You couldn\u2019t hear your name or anything being called. I asked for a PFJ! Had to continue my date to another day. Came back a few weeks later. They dropped it down to faulty equipment. No fine, just court costs. Thank you Cabarrus County, worst court for traffic court in NC! I avoidCabarrus like the plague now! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but just one. I was a part of a group that ran a program at a retreat center about four time a year. Normally, once we are at the center, the people involved in running the program do not leave. If we need anything, a member of the group not involved in that weekend\u2019s program will bring it to us. But, on one particular weekend, we ran out of something. It was the first time that I had worked on a retreat since I had joined the group. Since I wasn\u2019t needed for the next hour or so, I volunteered to go. The leader for the weekend was okay with this and told me to \u201churry.\u201d I made my way to the grocery store, found the needed stuff and started back. The center is fairly remote, with very sparely traveled state highways leading to it. So, at one point, when I had maybe ten miles to go on one of these roads, I took advantage of the clear road and clear skies and put the pedal to the metal. And then I saw those lights. A county cop behind me. He was not the least bit nice. He wrote the ticket making sure that he told me how much the fine would be. i asked him if I could pay him the fine then (I knew that I couldn\u2019t but my daddy had told me to always ask that.). He said no. I went back to the retreat center delivering the stuff we had needed and sharing news about the ticket. Folks in the group actually collected money to pay the $135.00 fine and as others shared of tickets that they had gotten along that road, it became apparent that the county cops knew when we would be at the center (I was no secret) and took full advantage of this to make their quotas.

Coming down Highway 9 approaching Saratoga, California, I was doing at least 45, easily, in a 30 mph zone and was pulled over. The officer asked me if I knew how fast I\u2019d been going. \u201cNo sir,\u201d I replied. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I had the courage to look at my speedometer. I was terrified.\u201d He smiled, \u201cWell, I clocked you at 43 and it seemed you were accelerating. Do you have any excuse?\u201d \u201cSir, the winds were perfect, the pavement smooth as glass, the weather was flawless and it was a great ride.
