            "answer_text": "This is something of a far reaching question! How do you personally think you can identify an Ancient Coin? To begin with Age is not a Factor in this equation! Most Ancient Coins were made by the Striking Method; that is 2 Dies with the Design for the Obverse (Top) and Reverse (Bottom) contained a Blank piece of Metal. A Collar of Metal would then be set in place before both Top and Bottom Dies were given a heavy blow from a large Mallet! The idea behind the Collar being to prevent the Metal Blank from moving during the Striking process. This method of Manufacturing/Minting Coins was to continue right up until the 16th Century. However as a method of making Coins; if you will, this was far from perfect! More often than not the Metal Blank would shift inside the Collar and the resulting Design on both Obverse and Reverse would be somewhat uneven to say the least. This discrepancy or error is mostly seen on Ancient and Medieval Coinage. Another Factor to take into consideration with regard to Ancient Coinage is the Thickness of the Metal. The greater majority with some exceptions of Ancient Coins were thicker than the later Medieval Coins were. Regardless of the Metal employed during the Manufacturing process, most Ancient Coins had thicker Flans ( name for Metal Blank) and when Struck between 2 Dies these Flans would often exhibit small Cracks in the Metal; not seen on Modern Coinage. Another indicator that these may in fact be Ancient in Origin! Then there is the Metal itself. Copper or Bronze Coins tend over a long period of Time to acquire something called a Patination. At it\u2019s finest this can be very beautiful and at its worst pretty awful! These Patinations or surface deposits are formed due to Oxidation of the underlying Metal. That is to say in simple terms that over a considerable Period of Time; shall we say 2000 years, the Copper or Bronze undergoes some Chemical changes which present themselves in the form of some type of Coating on the Coins surface. Mostly this is seen as some variant of the Color Green and can at times be quite smooth overall. However it is possible to find this Patination also termed Verdigris as an uneven thick and unpleasant surface coating. This can at times be so bad as to obscure the underlying Design on the Coin beneath. Needless to say this process does not just occur on Base Metal Coins of Ancient Manufacture but may also be seen on Coins from the 18th Century. A final note on this point, the Patination may not always be Green in Color! Other shades such as Red, Browns of varying Hues and even Orange and Black are also to be found. Much of this has something to do with the Locality and types of Soils which play there part in the Chemical Changes to the Appearance of an Ancient Coin. To put this into context, an Orange Patina may be seen on Ancient Coins excavated from Middle Eastern Soils. To Identify an Ancient Coin by Type is to know it\u2019s Origins! Firstly you need to establish which Ancient Civilisation created it. So your task would be to determine if the the Coin or Coins was Greek, Roman, Celtic, Indian, Persian, Phoenician or Chinese even. I guess we can rule out Chinese because their Coins consisted of Calligraphic Inscriptions and no Portrait types; at least not until the early 20th Century. To identify the Place or People\u2019s whom may have Struck your Coin you shall need to do some personal research and your Local Library is the best place to start. Most Libraries will have Books on the Subject of Coins or Numismatics. Another method you could try, especially in this Age of Modern Tech is to look it or them up on the Internet. Lastly you may wish to consult a Museum Specialist; something I have done myself before now. Before you can even think about the subject of Value it is most important to establish the Identity and Origin of the Piece in question. Once you have done this then your next step would be to determine wether or no your Coin has been \u201cMinted\u201d in Gold, Silver, Bronze, Copper, Lead, Tin, or even on occasion Iron. Obviously an Ancient Gold Coin May command a premium. I say may because this also depends on Scarcity, Rareity, and State of Preservation. In other words, is your Ancient Coin in good condition! It does not matter one tiny little bit otherwise because if your Gold Coin is poorly preserved then it\u2019s Value shall only lie in the fact it is Bullion or Precious Metal and nothing to do with Age. Preservation is all important here and without that you only have a low value piece of Metal! Personally when it comes to the Value of an Ancient Coin, unless of Historical interest, I\u2019m not really that concerned about this. Collectors or so-called Coin Collectors place far too much emphasis on Value in Monetary terms and very little on Historical importance which is where their real interest should lie. You cannot truly deem yourself to be an ardent Collector of anything if your main concern shall be only linked to Value! Many people buy certain types of Gold and Silver Coins for the Investment potential; these are not true Collectors in the real sense of the word. The Subject of Ancient Coinage is a vast field and some knowledge of this is really required but I hope my answer to your initial Question shall have been of some help to you! Lucie Lou S.

According to Portrait comparison may aid in identification, especially for heavily worn coinage. Ideal portraits are presented in gold, silver, and bronze, as well as a worn example, rest of materials are very rare to found. some image to make clear.source : from internet\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014      ",
