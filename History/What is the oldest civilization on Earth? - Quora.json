            "answer_text": "Actually, no one knows. There are only theories based on ancient structures. Until the 21st century (and even today in most schools) kids are taught that civilization began in the \u2018Golden Crescent\u2019 or Mesopotamia as 18th/19th centuries had found these ruins to be the oldest known and that they had likely settled in one place due to the discovery/invention of agriculture and herding. Since then much older major and highly advanced structures have been found, in particular, Goblekli Tepi in SSE Turkey. Very large stone columns, similar in form to those found in Britain (Stone Henge being the best known). The Turkish discovery has well crafted animal art cut into many of the columns and only a small portion of the area has been excavated. This construction has been generally accepted to be at least 11,000 years old. And it is evident a group does not start out building and carving structures this size unless they had experience elsewhere, but where ? It is very probable that there are yet undiscovered advanced civilization (s) worldwide that have yet to be found. Many researches have now conceded that the Sphynx in Egypt is much older than the 4500 years it has been thought to be. Geologists (See Dr. Robert Schock) have determined that weathering on the original Sphynx body could have only happened when Egypts\u2019 climate was much wetter and rainier, which would have been at least 7500 BC. Many have concluded the Object, based on other evidence is likely a construction from roughly 10,500 BCE. So your question can not yet be answered with any certainty, at all. ",

            "answer_text": "I will start with a diagram I made for you. It shows the known earliest civilisations plotted on a timeline. It starts with the end of the Ice Age, and ends with the birth of Christ. The colours on the bar shows the mesolithic, neolithic, bronze and iron ages. Forgive me for using Scrat the Squirrel to illustrate the end of the Ice Age.  As you can see, Sumeria, Egypt, and Indus Valley are much recent arrivals compared to the Ggantija, Catalhoyuk or Gobekli Tepe civilisations. We do not know much about the oldest among them \u2014 the Gobekli Tepe civilisation of Turkey that started some 8,000 years before the nativity and more than 4,000 years before the Sumerian civilisation. But, they have left us the first cathedral on a hill:  The next one \u2014 Catalhoyuk in Turkey \u2014 is much better known. It is believed to be the first town in history. It came about in 7,500 BCE. That\u2019s far before Harappa, Thebes or Xian. At its height, 10,000 people lived in Catalhoyuk, which was about 1% of the global population back then. It survived for 2,000 years. That\u2019s as long as the Greek and Roman Civilisations. It impacted later civilisations as far afield as Jericho. They were the original hub for pottery and agriculture, making sedentary life possible. With innovations like urban living and architecture, they could scale it up to an unprecedented level, and grow it even further with the introduction of formal trade and organised religion. They also probably had the earliest form of democracy, even socialism. The city was made on two mounds with the \u00c7ar\u015famba River flowing between the two mounds.  They lived in a packed Kowloon-type settlement, where diligently cleaned and smoothly plaster-finished homes were decorated with art, sculptures, wall painting, skulls, plaster relief, bull horns etc.  They buried their dead by folding them into baskets right inside their home, and often took the baskets out of graves. All homes were almost equal, with one special building for community prayer. 10 millennia ago, the city, whose real name we shall never find out, was founded in a marshland. It was far from their farms of wheat and barley on dry land. They built the city there because of the dense clay found there. It was the basis of their plaster. Catalhoyuk ancients were \u201cplaster freaks\u201d. They used it to make everything from multi-storied buildings to little figurines. They even covered the skulls of their dead with plaster! Spearheading the neolithic revolution they also grew peas, almonds and pistachios, reared sheep and cattle, and gathered fruits from the forests. Hunting was still a major economic activity. Pottery and obsidian tools appear to have been major industries; obsidian tools were probably both used and also traded for items such as Mediterranean sea shells and flint from Syria.  Here are some sights of Catalhoyuk:  And a reconstruction in situ of a Catalhoyuk home:   An interesting article: The Seeds of Civilization ",
