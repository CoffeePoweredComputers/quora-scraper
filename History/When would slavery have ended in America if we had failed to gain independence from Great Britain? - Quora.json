Britian in theory, had slavery, but by the late 18th Century its practice in Britian was not wide spread, and there were many free black people in Britian at the time, and serving in the British Navy. The British Parliament outlawed the practice of Slavery, I think in 1830, and by 1835 had directed the Royal Navy to stop slave trading on the high seas. The Royal Navy would stop ships and free any on board slaves. This action stopped most of the slave trade and caused much diplomatic unrest with USA. This naval action was later extended to the South Pacific in 1870s to nip in the but the practice of \u201cblack birding\" where Pacific Islanders were taken to work as \u201cindentured labour\" in Queensland sugar plantations.
