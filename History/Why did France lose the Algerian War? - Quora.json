            "answer_text": "First, France did not loose the war, it won it !That being said, the point was at there were two class of citizens in algeria, the french and the indig\u00e8nes (natives) with the former having full citizenship and the later partial vote rigths and were forbidden to move to mainland France. This situation could no longer be maintained, it has to be solved one of two ways :1) Give full citizenship to every body so that Algeria will be in anyway a part of France.2) Give independance to Algeria and full algerian citizenship to all residents. The problem of 1) was that it would allow the muslim population to legally migrate to mainland France and \"colonize\" it with its foreign customs, a thing that was firmly refused by president De Gaulle.So option 2) was choosen, but the muslim natives refused to share their country with french people (well, at least the armed muslims that made the war, so those that counted). The choice was openly given \"La valise ou le cercueil\" (\"The suitcase or the coffin\"). This choice applied also to the natives who sided with France, especially in the french army (the harka) and to the jews, who, also natives themselves, were by this time assimilated to the french (this is btw the origin of the large jews population in France, the previous one having been decimated during WWII).And so option 2) ended in a human disaster, with more than a million people fleeing to save their skin with only what they could bring with them. So, no, France did not loose anything, it freely choose to separate itself from Algeria to not have to give citizenships to a huge muslim population.The choice to maintain the inegalitarian situation would have mean an eternal unrest wich the french population was tired to. A strange thing is that the muslim population that De Gaulle did not whant moving to France was in fact invited in the 60's up to 1974 by hundreds of thousands to work in the french factories.Was in fact all this mess more about money than human's rigths ?

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m no historian but since some of the answers here were so bad, i found in myself the need to explain some of our basical history. The person who asked the question probably only wants to know the reason why \u201cFrance\u201d (aka a major power at that time) lost to \u201cAlgeria\u201d (a colonny), well i\u2019ll have to apologize because i\u2019m not going to answer this question right away. ( but i\u2019ll get to it eventually.) First of all , i wanted to clarify this ; the french colonisation had started from 1830. And from the first day, algerians had put up a fight. The algerian military was eventually defeated, due to the huge difference in powers, but even since then the people hadn\u2019t stopped fighting back. The thing was clear, the population absolutely refused the frensh occupation. Nobody wanted intruders forcing their way in one\u2019s home,they would fight them! to protect themselves and their families, and don\u2019t go thinking france was easy on us, oh no they absolutely weren\u2019t. They hated us! mainly for the fact that we are \u201cdirty arabic muslims\u201d,and they didn\u2019t want anything to do with us, they only wanted the land! our righteous land! what about the populaion? they planned to exterminate it, and they did try to indeed. Now you see, even though ,not armed and extremely weak due to previous events, Algeria did resist till the very last beat. With that said , you must know that our weapons at that time were very primal compared to french\u2019s great forces, and we had a lack of experience in warfare too. Also our country was a peaceful one that wasen\u2019t prepared for attacks, and france charged on us full equipped and ready with three times our number and they were obviously able to take us down. And thus, invade us. The colonisation stayed over 100 years and meanwhiles there had always been people who stood against it; the most famous being \u201cMissali El haje\u201d who went on a social debate to gain independance back, he was turned down on several occasions and put in jail too. But he helped developing the idea of freedom and independance within the hearts and minds of the algerians ,who started losing faith and hope, some even started adapting to the situation. But one thing was sure, there always were people believing in independance (so don\u2019t think that came from nowhere.) What exactly happened in the event of 8 mai 1945? , you may ask. Well let me briefly explain ; In WW2, algerians went to fight in the France army, But only after France governement Promised To Give Us Our Freedom. The war ended, The whole world celebrated it\u2019s end , so did algerians. Happy to win and thinking they would finally get their independance back , they went in the streets partying and reminding french of their Promise. and guess what? France couldn\u2019t have been clearer . Long story short, it was a tragedy ,million of peoples died in the most horrific ways , i won\u2019t say more about that though. The fact was that France refused to give back our most precious right, it even denied any promise given, changing the words maliciously. And at that exact point did people realise that: \u201c what was taken by force can only be reinstated by force\u201d and so the real thing begin. Rebels worked fast, the soldiers that came back from WW2 had gained experience, the algerian will was stronger than ever. By the first of november 1954 ,we had an organisation :\u201cFLN\u201d and a military force as well, we were totally prepared and france saw nothing coming when we dropped the first bomb. We didn\u2019t have much weapons yet, but we still managed. The most important was that people started believing , people knew it was something (even though the french media tried denying the independance movement, claiming it was purely terrorists acts-as always ha!- that didn\u2019t work) people weren\u2019t dump ,the movement was still very weak and repaused mainly on street fights at first but they helped it, youngers started joining. We stole weapons from french ,our neighbours were of big help as well! especially Tunisia ,Moracco and Lybia -since the Soviet Union did help out a lot sending us renforcements (arms,guns, meds..etc) due to their known acts in favour of \u201cindependance movements\u201d which was all in all a cold war strategy to weaken the capitalisme side- we had no way to enter weapons from our borders , but we could transpass them from Tunisia and Moraco and stuff \u2026but that\u2019s another story, Egypt helped as well. (One thing was sure, we sure as hell beat the sorry ass of france!) By the time France tried to strike back, it was already too late , any forces they sent came back beaten down and defeated so they had no choice but to sit down and listen to what we had to say. Not long after, we became independant , and france retired, defeated and with lots of regret. Now, no matter what had happened after the independance of Algeria, it won\u2019t change anything. Algeria won the \u201cAlgerian war\u201d, and i have no idea what you have been thought at school but it must -probably- sucks to be lied to, so now you know. And on a final attempt to try and respond to your question ; France had lost because it underestimated it\u2019s oppenent and took us lightly. There\u2019s other reasons of course such as ; It had political struggles at that time, it being already weak from Germany\u2019s attacks, it lost powers and territories from all above the world and thus grow weaker.. etc (but here i\u2019m only telling the history of my country.) ps: it also lost because it acted sickly! it\u2019s the villain in this story (i\u2019m very sorry, but it\u2019s true tbh ,what it did to algerians was almost sadistic! ) and villains always end up losing ,darling.
