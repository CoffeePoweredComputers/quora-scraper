            "answer_text": "I have studied a lot about afghanistan since I find its culture and history quite fascinating, and also due to my grandmother\u2019s affiliation with afghanistan, so I think I am capable enough to answer this, that being said please do help me out in corrections. afghanistan in itself, is home to several different ethnic groups, this is a map that indicates the racial and ethnic diversity of afghanistan, unlike several countries of the world, it is not as homogenous.  disclaimer: I'm not generalising anyone, not everyone looks like this, I'm just going to give some examples of what features these people possess. pashtuns:they are the largest ethnic group, according to many demographics they make up 42% of afghanistan, however other sources argue that they make up as much as 50%- 60% of the country. in fact, the word afghan is actually synonymous with the word pashtun. they are an iranian ethnic group and speak pashto as their native language, an iranian language. their beautiful culture is based on the pashtunwali code; an ancient way of life.  tajiks:approximately, they make up 27% of the country and are the second largest ethnic group. they are an iranian ethnic group and speak varieties of the persian language, such as tajiki which is close to dari, the lingua franca of afghanistan. the culture of the tajik people has been present since antiquity and dates back to thousands of years ago.  hazaras:they are the third largest group in afghanistan and make up 9% of the whole country, they speak hazaragi, a dialect of persian. genetically, they cluster closer and more with some turkic groups such as uzbeks than to tajiks and pashtuns, hence they have more of a mongoloid appearance. they have preserved their magnificent culture and heritage throughout centuries.  uzbeks:they make up 8%-9% of afghanistan and are a turkic ethnic group, they predominantly speak uzbek, a turkic language, alongside dari and tajiki. the culture of the uzbek people is quite vibrant and unique, and was formed over thousands of years. different central asian tribes have contributed to the modern-day uzbek culture.  aimaq:they are a nomadic tribe which distinguishes them from other groups and make up 4% of afghanistan. they speak a number of sub-dialects of the aimaq dialect of persian. aymaq is a turkic-mongolic word which means \u2018tribe\u2019. while the aimaq have traditionally been a nomadic people, they are gradually becoming semi-nomadic, traveling only in certain seasons.  turkmens:they are a turkic ethnic group, making up 3% of the entire population and speak turkmen, a language of the oghuz branch of turkic languages, such as turkish. turkmen are culturally and linguistically related to other turkic peoples, such as kazakhs, kyrgyz and the aforementioned uzbeks. the amazing turkmen culture has been influenced by ancient nomadic lifestyle.  baloch:making up 2% of the nation, they are an iranian ethnic group and speak balochi, an iranian language. ethnically, the baloch are divided into two groups, suleimani and makrani. the former are the ethnic baloch people whilst the latter are descendants of the bantu people of east africa that settled in balochistan and adopted the baloch culture. the first row is of suleimani people and the second is of makrani people.  nuristanis:they fall under the rest of the 4% of the country, and are an iranian ethnic group who speak languages that represent the fourth branch of the indo-iranian languages, natively nuristani, which were previously known as kafiri languages. the nuristani do not have a formal tribal structure, however they do designate themselves by the names of the local regions they are from.  brahuis:brahuis are an ethnic group that speak brahui, a language with contributions of dravidian elements and other indo-aryan languages. however, many have intermarried with native baloch people and have adopted the balochi language and culture as well. their origins are heavily debated over and they are an ethnic minority of afghanistan.  pashai:they are a dardic ethnic group and said to be one of the oldest foreign inhabiters of afghanistan. they speak the beautiful pashai languages, which belong to the dardic subgroup of the indo-iranian languages, some, however, are bilingual and are also fluent in pashto. they\u2019re often also referred to as kohistani people, who are also a dardic ethnic group.  pamiris:pamiris are an iranian ethnic group and are native to the badakhshan province of afghanistan. they speak the pamiri languages, that belong to the branch of eastern iranian languages. pamiris have their own amazing distinguished culture from other ethnic groups and are often classified as a subgroup of the previously mentioned tajik people.  kyrgyz:they are a turkic ethnic group and speak the kyrgyz language, a distinct turkic language with mongol influences. most of the kyrgyz people in afghanistan live in the wakhan region and mostly lead a nomadic lifestyle. since they are a turkic ethnic group, they cluster with other such groups such as the formerly mentioned turkmens and uzbeks.  gujjars:they are nomadic people categorised as a tribe or caste of the punjabi ethnic group and primarily speak the gujari or gojri language, a variant of the indo-aryan languages. they are known as a tribe of \u2018fierce warrior\u2019 people whose pivotal point of tribal identity dates back to the gurjaradesa kingdom which mainly comprised of parts of current-day rajasthan and gujarat.  as you can see there is no uniform race of the people from afghanistan, everyone differs ethnically and culturally, these identities are what have been grasped together to form the national identity of an afghan, and the manifestations of the beauty that afghanistan beholds. god bless afghanistan.

            "answer_text": "The people of Afghanistan are extraordinarily diverse. Below are the \u201caverage faces\u201d of Afghans; of course, this can\u2019t be entirely accurate. It was made by http://faceresearch.org so you can check there if you want to see their data.  Afghanistan is a very ethnically diverse country. No one ethnicity has a majority.  A linguistic map of Afghanistan. Note that many smaller groups are not included. Alongside the largest ethnicities, there are many dozens of smaller ethnicities with only a few thousand people, such as the Kyrgyz of the Wakhan corridor (who I wrote about here), who are extremely isolated from the rest of the country, and the Brahui people, who speak a Dravidian language! According to the CIA World Factbook, here are the seven largest ethnic groups of Afghanistan: Pashtun - 42%Tajik - 27%Hazara - 10%Uzbek - 9%Aimak - 4%Turkmen - 3%Nuristani - 2.5%Baloch - 2%It is difficult to attain accurate statistics due to the ongoing war, especially for the dozens of smaller ethnic groups. In this answer, we will look at some of the more unique groups. It is also important to note that many urban Afghans, such as my father, are mixed. The smallest groups are the only ones not to mix extensively, perhaps in order to preserve their culture. A very common misconception that I abhor about Afghanistan is that Afghans are Arabs living in the Middle East. Iranians are also subject to this unfortunate stereotype, but they are even more connected to the Middle East politically and historically than Afghanistan. Afghans have nothing to do with the Middle East or Arabs. Muslims do not equal Arab! This is a diverse country populated by various ethnic groups, predominantly Indo-Iranian and Turkic groups, and even more. I also have a bit of extra information to add more insight into the languages of the people and where they live. No, these are the people of Afghanistan. Pashtuns speak Pashto. They are the most populous ethnic group in Afghanistan. Pashtuns live predominantly in southern Afghanistan, excluding the extreme south, and there are also pockets of Pashtuns in northwestern and eastern Afghanistan; their Pashtunwali, an ethical code, is famous to study. They have many tribes that are all quite different. Pashtuns are usually darker in skin tone than Tajiks.  Tajiks speak Dari (Afghan Persian), which is a dialect that preserves older features of the Persian language and has much less European loanwords than Farsi (Iranian Persian). Despite Tajiks numbering less than Pashtuns, Dari is Afghanistan\u2019s lingua franca. Tajiks live in various parts of the north of Afghanistan, and are the country\u2019s most prevalent urban dwellers. Tajiks are very mixed because of this. The ones in the mountains are much paler than ones in cities.  Hazaras speak Hazaragi, which is a dialect of Dari with many more Mongol loanwords. The Hazaras are descended from Mongols that came during the invasions of Genghis Khan, who mixed with locals. Some believe that they are direct descendants of him, but there has been not enough testing to prove this. Hazaras live in Hazarajat, the central area of Afghanistan. Hazaras face discrimination from the Taliban. Historically, they made up larger percentages of Afghanistan\u2019s population, but they have been discriminated against and killed. The Hazara fertility rate is very high.  Uzbeks are a Turkic people that speak Uzbek. They have a long history in Afghanistan; many of Afghanistan\u2019s most famous rulers have been Uzbek. They live in the northern parts of Afghanistan, close to the border with Uzbekistan, and have a unique mix of cultures. The Uzbeks have mixed with many people over the years, even in Uzbekistan, so they can look very different from each other, just like Tajiks.  Aimaq speak the Aimaq dialect of Persian, which is very similar to Dari, but quite different from Farsi. However, Dari still preserves many older aspects of Persian not present in Aimaq. They live predominantly in a small part of centre-west Afghanistan, where they are semi-nomadic, giving them a unique status in Afghanistan. There are traditionally four different Aimaq tribes. All of them have mixed a lot with the surrounding area, so the Aimaq are very diverse.  Turkmen are a Turkic group, like the Uzbeks, that speak Turkmen; the language is very similar to Turkish. Turkmen live in the extreme northwest of Afghanistan, on the border with Turkmenistan. They have historically mixed with Indo-Iranic people much more than other Turkic groups in central Asia, though some in the mountains still preserve their original characteristics.  Nuristanis speak various languages in the Nuristani grouping of Indo-Iranian languages. They live almost entirely in Nuristan (land of light). The Nuristanis have lived very isolated in this region of eastern Afghanistan for centuries, preserving the original features of the Aryans, which make them stand out in Afghanistan. Many foreigners don\u2019t know that some Afghans look like this, since they think they are all dark Arabs.  Baloch speak the Balochi language. They are also very populous in Iran and Pakistan. According to their lore, they come from Syria, and are descended from the uncle of Muhammad, Islam\u2019s prophet. But this is disputed, and most anthropologists think that they came from around present-day Azerbaijan. The Baloch in Afghanistan all live in the extreme south, in the Registan (desert), near Iran and Pakistan\u2019s Balochistans. They look very different from most Afghans.  Brahui are speakers of Brahui, which is a Dravidian language. For this reason, they are extremely unique. The other Dravidian languages (like Malayalam and Tamil) are all in southern India. The origin of the Brahui in Afghanistan is uncertain. They live in southeastern Afghanistan, and are culturally quite isolated from the remainder of the country. They look very different from other Afghans.  Pamiris, who only created their own identity in the past century, speak predominantly Shughni and Wakhi. They live in the northeast of Afghanistan, near the border with Tajikistan. Pamiris are famous for their delicious food! Because of cultural differences, there is an independence movement for the Tajik Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region and the Afghan province of Badakhshan to unite and become independent. The Pamiris are very isolated and look unique, as they have not ethnically mixed with others much. According to many, they look \u201cEuropean\u201d, even moreso than Nuristanis, but I disagree personally.  Pashai are a Dardic people, originating from northern Pakistan. They speak Pashai. Their history in Afghanistan is lengthy; it is believed that the Pashai arrived to present-day Afghanistan 5000 years ago. They practiced Buddhism for a very long time. The Pashai live in Kohistan (mountain land) near Kabul. They tend to live in their own small mountain communities, and still look very distinguishable from the people around them. Some people call them the \u201cGypsies of Afghanistan\u201d. I\u2019m not sure why.  Punjabis, who speak Punjabi, are not native to Afghanistan, but they are a large immigrant group, most of whom arrived before the war. The Punjabis of Afghanistan live pretty much entirely in cities. Depending on where they live, their culture is either appreciated or has to be hidden. Some are Sikhs: Sikhism is the second largest religion in Afghanistan; it is the only country with this distinction. There are only about 10000 Sikhs, though. By the way, on the bottom left image, that\u2019s my uncle on the left! Though he isn\u2019t Punjabi.  Kyrgyz are a traditionally nomadic Turkic group. They are few in Afghanistan. I linked an answer about them and their unique history at the start of this answer. They live entirely in the extreme northeast reaches of the Wakhan corridor, living more than 4000m (13123ft) above sea level. The ones here are still nomadic. They are completely isolated from the remainder of the country.  - Afghanistan is a BEAUTIFUL country with many different people! There are some smaller ethnic groups I have missed in this answer. Some people think that Afghanistan is all Arab, and that Afghans have a dark skin tone. Others like to say that Afghanistan is a white nation with \u201cpure Aryans\u201d. The truth is that Afghanistan is an extremely diverse country and that the skin colour of Afghans should not matter. Nor their background, customs, and religion. Ethnic violence has damaged Afghanistan but hopefully one day it can finally improve. Long Live Afghanistan!
