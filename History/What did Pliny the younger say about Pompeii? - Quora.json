            "answer_text": "Pliny the Younger was born in AD 61. He died in AD 113. Pliny the Elder (his uncle) was born in AD 23 or 24. He died in AD 79. The volcano Vesuvius erupted in AD 79. The lava from the volcano buried several towns and villas in the area: ** Pompeii ** Herculaneum ** Stabiae ** Villa Oplontis ** The Villa of the Papyrus ** The Villas of Boscoreale According to tradition, the eruption took place in late August. Some observers believe the eruption took place in another month. Pliny the Younger was a young man of 17 or 18 when the eruption took place. He was an eyewitness to this event. He was watching from Misenum. He could see the Bay of Naples (Napoli) and he could see the volcano while the eruption took place. His uncle Pliny the Elder was in charge of the Roman fleet based at Misenum. He had received a message from some friends in Stabiae who was asking for his help. He wanted to go and help them get away from the danger zone. At the same time, he was very interested in the natural phenomenon which was happening in front of them. Pliny the Elder sailed to Stabiae to assist his friends and to watch the eruption from a close distance. He made it to Stabiae, but he died while resting on the beach before returning to Misenum. His health was not good. The crew was able to get away. They brought his body back to Misenum. Pliny the Younger survived, because he stayed at Misenum. He did not go with his uncle to Stabiae. Some 25 years later, around AD 104, his friend Tacitus contacted him, asking him what happened when the volcano had erupted many years before. Pliny wrote two letters to Tacitus about the event. They are both preserved. Here is the reference: ** Book 6 letter 16 ** Book 6 letter 20 It is easy to find an english translation of these letters on the internet. Tacitus was a historian. He was writing about Roman history of the first century AD. We have two works from his hand: ** the Histories ** the Annals Unfortunately, these works are only partially preserved. Large parts are missing. Apparently, Tacitus never used the information Pliny sent to him \u2014 or maybe he used it in a part of his work which is no longer available. ",
