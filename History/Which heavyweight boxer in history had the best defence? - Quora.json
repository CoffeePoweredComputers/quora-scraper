            "answer_text": "It has to be this dude on the right:  Way back in \u201864, this was an all too familiar sight of an almost un-hittable Muhammad Ali making the meanest cat in the HW division (Liston) punch thin air. HW champion Sonny Liston was a very capable boxer, but on the night he barely laid a glove on a razor sharp Ali- whose ring movements & defensive reflexes kept him well out of harms way. In most of Ali\u2019s fights during the \u201860s - a common defensive pattern emerged whereby Ali was generally OUT of punching range but his opponents were IN punching range. This being the case - Ali could jab & one-two them all night long whilst taking almost zero headshots in return. This is exactly what transpired against Liston who understandably became demoralized & wound up taking a terrible head beating from Ali. However, it has to be said that Ali\u2019s defensive brilliance only lasted for about 3 years ( \u201864-\u201867). After his enforced exile from boxing ended in 1970, both his feline reflexes & defensive footwork were never the same. He was already a fighter in sharp decline.  This rapid decline was clearly evident in his first meeting with Joe Frazier back in \u201871, where he probably took more clean headshots in one fight than ALL his previous fights combined. Perhaps the most elusive heavyweight boxer in history had all of a sudden become very hittable\u2026\u2026.lucky for him that Mother Nature had coincidentally blessed him with a granite jaw because the \u201870s version of Ali took some of the worst head beatings in HW history.

            "answer_text": "I never really heard of Chris Byrd until reading some of these answers here and before i went on to say something, i looked him up, watched most of his fights. I must say he definitely takes the crown, he\u2019s the most defensive HW boxer overall i\u2019ve seen thus far. I know some may agree and some may not. Here\u2019s why: Byrd is short compare to most heavyweights, he\u2019s already at a huge disadvantage to overcome and yet he\u2019s able to use his defense skills to avoid getting hit as much as possible and actually outbox bigger and taller guys than him, that's very impressive. Usually heavyweight boxers around his height such as Tyson, Frazier, Marciano, Dempsey, Tua, and goes on\u2026 are aggressive fighters.Ali\u2019s defense was good at best, a lot of people just haven\u2019t realized is that Ali was so fast and quick, he was almost impossible to be touch, his speed was mainly his defense, he utilized his movements to avoid damage which was great, but when he got older, he couldn\u2019t do the same, in that matter, Ali never adjusted, he relied on his physical attributes such as his granite chin and heart which was all great but cost him his health.

            "answer_text": "You could argue a few, but my choice, hands down, is this guy:  Chris Byrd. He was barely over 6ft tall. He was a middleweight in the 1992 Olympics. He decided to fight as a Heavyweight as a pro. Now, some may argue guys like Ali or Fury had great defense, but here's the thing: Ali was still tall for a HW of his generation. Fury is huge for a HW. They both had physical advantages. Conversely, with his small stature, Byrd had several big disadvantages to overcome. And this was in the era when the super giants started to come to prominence in the HW division. That Byrd managed not just to survive against most of his opponents who were almost always taller and heavier than he was was, but actually beat most of them, was incredible. He became a 2 time HW champion. Yes, there were better champions. But none relied on defensive brilliance to overcome small stature disadvantages the way Byrd had to. He was a defensive wizard who thrived in the land of giants. ",

But he was not a textbook example of good defense. Jim Corbett and Gene Tunney might get top honors in that regard. According to Ripleys BELIEVE IT or NOT, Corbett never got a bloody nose or fat lip. That style requires constant movement on the balls of your feet . Not backwards , but circling. The hands can be low on the outside, but come up at close range. They used a sticking, stabing jab. Not the flicking stinging jab so often used today, nor the awesome strate left of powerhouse heavyweights like Sonny liston. Jack Johnson was genius at defense and he did it without a lot of movement. His style is not well understood by today's boxers or fans. In general the 1960s and 70s show better technique then the old days, but the genius element is often missing. A uniformity was gained, but certain techniques were lost. ",
