            "answer_text": "One of the first points to consider is the fact that some high-percentage, (I mean I would be making up a number here but let\u2019s say 90+%) of the wine made in the world is NOT meant for any aging. A vast majority of the oceans of crushed, fermented grape juice made on this planet is made for immediate consumption. Anywhere from right-away to a year or two. A few good examples of this are box-wine, Yellow Tail, and any $7 Fighting Varietals (BV Coastal, Mondavi Woodbridge, Beringer Founders Estates) etc. \u2014- the box wine actually HAS an expiration date (usually like 3\u20136 months from packaging) \u2026 the Yellow Tail doesn\u2019t even have a vintage year, does it? (I admit it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen a bottle. If they do have a year on the label, fine, no big deal.) and the $7 major bottle does have a year but \u2026 None are made for aging. If you keep that bottle of Yellow Tail on the kitchen counter in your little wine rack for a year or two, and then go to open it , you\u2019ll notice a decline in flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel. Similarly with that 2016 Founders/Coastal/Cheap Chardonnay. They are simply not vinted for long term aging. Now let us consider wine that IS made for aging \u2014- but has not aged well. Why? Well that is an outstanding question without a perfect answer. It could have been a flaw in the winemaking process, and all that wine will show a similar flaw. I worked at a vineyard & winery that made small amounts of wine, but had a super-pro Napa Valley-experienced winemaker who had a tremendous background both in the science of winemaking and the art of practical experience of winemaking. He could walk you through an example, and show you how, for example, the \u201cpipes\u201d that the wine gets pumped-over through , oops! Someone didn\u2019t properly sterilize a fitting or allowed it to touch the floor before wine was put through it! That alone can introduce a microorganism that doesn\u2019t SPOIL the wine like bad milk, but contributes to poor lifespan or longterm aging. Similarly, wooden palettes used to hold barrels & cases in the warehouse, they are known havens for \u201cTrichloroanisole \u201c the chemical known as TCA, which produces \u201cCork Taint\u201d, and the nooks & crannies of the winery love to hold something known as Brettanomyces , or \u201cBrett\u201d, which produces the mustiness and wet-cardboard corruption of wine people can detect immediately even without much wine training. And to be completely honest, sometimes things just happen. In 2005, we had an extremely-well -made red Meritage blend that was from the 2002 vintage, and was built for the looooooong hall. It was delicious in 2005 though. However, every once in a while, you might open a bottle for the tasting room and somehow, it was \u201coff\u201d. Why? It happens all day every day in the wine business. There is no magical predictor or way to prevent it. It happens. Sort of like when you get a brand-new package of ground beef from a good grocery store, plenty of \u201cuse-by/sell-by\u201d date left, you open it, and smell that it\u2019s ruined. Why? It has a week left!? What happened?! Nature. Nature is an unforgiving mother and often does as she will. Having said this all, I strongly recommend people put away a bottle of wine every now and then for aging. Truly aged wine is amazing, it changes in an amazing way, and is extremely rewarding in the long-run. Even a $20 bill can get you a good bottle to put away and will reward you in 5\u201310 years for a special occasion. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking me to answer this question. I\u2019m not the world\u2019s foremost expert on wine. When I was drinking and had intended on keeping bottles for storing, they\u2019d get opened faster than the letter that bore my paycheck. With that out of the way, I would say that there are a lot of wines that can keep for years. The best ones for storing are red wines and fortified wines such as Port (some people buy a vintage Port when their child is born and then open it with them when they are of age). White wines generally don\u2019t last as long. Reds generally last longer because they generally have a higher alcohol content than *most* white wines and they have lower sugar content as well. Wines can spoil in storage for a variety of reasons, including how sanitary the bottling process was and if the cork becomes damaged and allows air/bacteria into the bottle. Make sure your bottles are stored in a cool, dry location, on their sides, in the dark while ensuring their foil (or sometimes wax) caps are intact and undamaged. Recently I had a dinner party with friends and bought a $40 Bordeaux to go along with the event to serve to my guests (as I no longer partake). It was about an 8 year old wine and from what I heard, my knowledge of alcohol paired up that wine just about perfectly with the meal. No aging was required\u2014and we had happy guests! ",
