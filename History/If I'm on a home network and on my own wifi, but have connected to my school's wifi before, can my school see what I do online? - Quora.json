Now, if your device has Device Policy or Spyware from your school, that is a different story. If you got your device from school (school paid for it), the school will most likely be able to see what you are doing. If it is your personal device (you bought with your own money), they will not be able to install spyware or device policy without your permission, and if they do with your permission on your personal device, they will not tell you/punish you, because well, it is your device.

If they dont have assigned ips or sign in with a name and password all is good as every time you register as guess you get a different ip on the network. ",
