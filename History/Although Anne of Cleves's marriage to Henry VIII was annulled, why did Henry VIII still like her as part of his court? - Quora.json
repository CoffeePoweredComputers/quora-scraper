            "answer_text": "Anne of Cleves was the living counterargument to Henry\u2019s enemies claiming he was a sadistic bloodthirsty jerk who killed his wives when he was bored or angry (directly and indirectly; many blamed Katherine of Aragon\u2019s ill health and death on how cruelly Henry cut her household in an attempt to punish her, Jane Seymour died in childbirth producing that son he was so desperate for, and of course everyone knew what happened to Anne Boleyn.) When Henry decided, for whatever reason, he was not interested in being married to Anne of Cleves, be it her looks, her inadvertently insulting him on their first meeting (she had no idea he was showing up and playing a game of disguise, he assumed she was being rude and disrespectful on purpose), or his just having decided he wanted the teenage Katherine Howard instead, he set his people looking for a way out, just as he\u2019d done with Katherine of Aragon. Just as with her, they \u201cfound\u201d something. In Katherine\u2019s case, she\u2019d refused to agree, rightfully from her point of view, and the \u201cKing\u2019s Great Matter\u201d had gone on and on. With Anne Boleyn, he didn\u2019t take any chances-when she didn\u2019t go quietly, he had an anointed Queen of England convicted of trumped-up charges and executed. Anne of Cleves wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew that protesting wasn\u2019t going to do anything other than make Henry angry. And an angry Henry could be a very deadly Henry. Even in the best-case scenario, where he didn\u2019t want to enrage the Protestant league nations and simply sent her packing back to her brother, she\u2019d be tainted goods, unlikely to be a good marriage prospect for anyone, and entirely at the mercy of her likely-annoyed family. So unlike her predecessors, she capitulated. She expressed great sorrow and reluctance at losing such a \u201cgreat\u201d husband, but of course he was right and a precontract existed, meaning their marriage was invalid. A terrible thing, but of course she agreed to it being officially dissolved. This was exactly what Henry wanted: someone who didn\u2019t argue with him, who didn\u2019t make his life difficult, who didn\u2019t scream or demand or invoke the authority of the Emperor or the Pope. Anne dutifully accepted her divorce. So Henry, being Henry, demonstrated to the world how amazingly well he\u2019d treat a woman who did as he asked. He gave her a household, an income, servants, a place at court, and even directed she be considered the King\u2019s beloved sister. When his enemies brought up his treatment of Katherine of Aragon or Anne Boleyn, he could point to Anne of Cleves and say \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! See how benevolent I am to a truly obedient and honorable woman. If they had been dutiful and penitent and recognized the rightness of my argument, they could have had a comfortable life.\u201d That Anne of Cleves was really pacifying a homicidal jerkass who had outright executed one wife and driven two others to their deaths less directly would have gone right over his head.

            "answer_text": " Because she was pleasant. She got along with him. She didn\u2019t create a scene. An ecclesiastical inquiry into her marriage was duly commissioned, and a delegation of councillors arrived at Richmond in early July to seek Anne\u2019s co-operation. Shocked by this sudden turn of events, Anne fainted. When she had sufficiently recovered herself, she steadfastly refused to give her consent to the inquiry. Before long, though, perhaps fearing a similar fate to Catherine of Aragon or, worse still, Anne Boleyn, Anne resolved to take a pragmatic approach. The marriage was duly declared illegal on 9 July, and the annulment was confirmed by parliament three days later. Anne wrote a letter of submission to the king, referring to \u201cyour majesty\u2019s clean and pure living with me\u201d, and offering herself up as his \u201cmost humble servant\u201d. \u201cAnne was to be richly rewarded for her compliance. She was given possession of Richmond Palace and Bletchingly Manor for life, together with a considerable annual income. This was further boosted by her right to keep all of her royal jewels, plate and goods in order to furnish her new properties. Moreover, she was to be accorded an exalted status as the king\u2019s \u2018sister\u2019, taking precedence over all of his subjects, with the exception of his children and any future wife that he might take.\u201d The marriage was duly declared illegal on 9 July, and the annulment was confirmed by parliament three days later Henry later granted her some additional manors, including Hever Castle, the former home of Anne Boleyn. This was to become her principal residence, and she lived very comfortably there on the fringes of public life. It says much for Anne\u2019s strength of character that she managed to accept and adapt to her new life with dignity.\u201c \u201cAfter the death of Catherine Howard speculation began at once about who would be the king\u2019s next wife. Among the potential candidates was Anne of Cleves. She had been careful to remain on good terms with Henry after their annulment, and had shown no signs of resentment at being so humiliatingly rejected. She had been a regular visitor to court and had also received several visits from her former husband, which by all accounts had been very convivial. The pair had exchanged New Year\u2019s gifts in 1542. But the king made no indication of wishing to revive their union, and although Anne was rumoured to be bitterly disappointed when he married his sixth and final wife, Katherine Parr, this may have been just for show.\u201c \u201cBy that time, Anne was comfortably ensconced at Hever with all the riches and honours of being a queen, but none of the disadvantages of being married to the ageing, bloated and increasingly tyrannical king. She remained there for the rest of her days, outliving her estranged husband, who died in 1547.\u201d Later in life they actually got along quite well. They spent much time talking. She outlived all his other wives. I do not know if it was her personality or she saw what happened to Anne Boleyn, but Anne of Cleves did the right thing by Henry. He knew this and reciprocated by doing the right thing by her. https://www.historyextra.com/period/tudor/anne-of-cleves-henry-viii-successful-queen-fourth-wife-tracy-borman/ ",

            "answer_text": "Anne, daughter of the late Duke of Juliers-Cleves, Johann III, and sister of his successor, Wilhelm, had first been mooted as a potential wife for the English king in the closing weeks of 1537, soon after the death of his beloved third wife,Jane Seymour. Anne was then 22 years of age, and had already been used as a pawn in the international marriage market when she had been betrothed to Fran\u00e7ois, heir to the duchy of Lorraine, in 1527. This had come to nothing, leaving her free to marry elsewhere. John Hutton, ambassador to Mary of Hungary, who had originally made the suggestion, admitted he had heard no great praise of her beauty. Such a recommendation hardly motivated Henry to pursue the scheme any further, and it was not until early 1539 that the idea was resurrected. This time Henry gave it more credence because he desperately needed new allies. Marriage eventually took place. Henry by this time was psychopathic, and his inability to consummate the marriage has been traditionally assigned to his revulsion at his new bride but more likely, due to his various medical conditions and it is at least equally possible that he was impotent. He was nearly twice his young bride\u2019s age and had become increasingly immobile in recent years. There had been no talk of a mistress for some time. This was not the sort of thing that he would have wished to be publicly known. Kings, even more than ordinary men, prided themselves on their sexual potency: it was, after all, vital for the continuation of their dynasty. Henry was a little too eager to boast to his physician, Dr Butts, that although he could not bring himself to have sex with Anne, he had had \u201ctwo wet dreams.\u201d To the outside world, everything was as it should be. Anne wrote to her family, assuring them that she was very happy with her husband. Meanwhile, Henry made sure that he appeared in public with his new queen as often as could be expected. A few days after the wedding, a celebratory tournament was held in Greenwich. The contemporary chronicler Edward Hall recorded the event and praised the new queen so effusively that nobody would guess there was anything amiss. \u201cShe was appareled after the English fashion, with a French hood, which so set forth her beauty and good visage, that every creature rejoiced to behold her.\u201d The new queen was,somewhat awkward which rendered her an embarrassment in the sophisticated world of the Tudor court. There was another reason why Henry was desperate to be rid of his fourth wife. By the spring of 1540, he had fallen madly in love with Catherine Howard, a pretty young lady-in-waiting in his wife\u2019s household. Before long, though, perhaps fearing a similar fate to Catherine of Aragon or, worse still, Anne Bpleyn, Anne resolved to take a pragmatic approach. The marriage was duly declared illegal on 9 July, and the annulment was confirmed by parliament three days later. Anne wrote a letter of submission to the king, referring to \u201cyour majesty\u2019s clean and pure living with me\u201d, and offering herself up as his \u201cmost humble servant\u201d. Anne was to be richly rewarded for her compliance. She behaved nobly and was given possession of Richmond Palace and Bletchingly Manor for life, together with a considerable annual income. This was further boosted by her right to keep all of her royal jewels, plate and goods in order to furnish her new properties. Moreover, she was to be accorded an exalted status as the king\u2019s \u2018sister\u2019, taking precedence over all of his subjects, with the exception of his children and any future wife that he might take.

            "answer_text": "The mail-order bride Henry VIII chose his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, from her portrait. He was disappointed by the real woman, but there is more to his change of heart than first appears. Why did Henry marry Anne? He couldn\u2019t get out of it! An alliance with the House of Cleves was a move intended to bring Henry the political support and power that he craved in Europe. He also needed a 'spare' to his heir, Prince Edward. By the time Anne arrived in England the original political reason for the union had diminished, and the lack of any immediate chemistry between Henry and Anne didn\u2019t help. Anne and Henry were also separated by language, culture and personality. They had not met before their betrothal. Henry, who liked to choose his brides for himself (normally from the ranks of ladies in waiting at court) may have already set his sights on Catherine Howard as his next wife. Desperate attempts to halt the Cleves wedding failed, much to the King\u2019s fury. Most embarrassing moment While on her way to London, Anne was surprised by a group of masked men, led by a tall burly middle-aged man who tried to kiss her. Anne, unused to such behaviour - pushed him away in bewilderment. In her embarrassment, she had rejected Henry himself, who was not impressed by her lack of sophistication. The chivalric tradition of meeting your betrothed in disguise was meant to demonstrate true love, as the bride-to-be be would see through the disguise and recognise her beloved. It was not a good start. Wedding nightmare Despite Thomas Cromwell trying to find ways for Henry to send Anne back, the marriage went ahead. The wedding night was a disaster. Wedding nightmare Despite Thomas Cromwell trying to find ways for Henry to send Anne back, the marriage went ahead. The wedding night was a disaster. Anne's innocence and Henry's impatience, combined with his apparently intermittent impotence, meant the marriage was not consummated. Henry persisted for four nights before blaming Anne's unattractive physical appearance for his failure to \u2018do his duty\u2019. The marriage was annulled after six months. A happy ending? Because Anne didn\u2019t make a fuss about the marriage being annulled, she and the King remained on good terms. She was rewarded for her acquiescence with a generous allowance and property in Kent. Anne was even invited to Hampton Court for Christmas, where on one occasion she danced with the new queen, Catherine Howard. ",

There\u2019s no way to write this without embarrassment, but maybe he felt he needed a sufficiently attractive young bride for him to \u201cperform\u201d; otherwise he couldn\u2019t \u201crise to the occasion,\u201d as it were. Now, royal children are often told not to care if their betrothed are attractive; it is their job to produce heirs. But Henry was the king himself, and no one could deny his demand to get a sufficiently beautiful bride, if that\u2019s what wanted. And he reportedly was very disappointed when she arrived but (reportedly) didn\u2019t look as good as her portrait. But Henry, though maybe being a narcissist (a common trait of kings with very great power), was not entirely without conscience. So he made sure Anne lived in style\u2026 and amazingly enough ended up seeing her as a good friend. By the way, when the next wife was selected for being a young beauty, Catherine Howard, the result was disaster all around\u2026 she cheated on Henry and didn\u2019t even deny it but said she \u201cloved a better man\u201d than Henry. Ouch. That had to hurt. Well, off with her head. ",

            "answer_text": "Because once the pressure to be a married couple was off, Henry found that he enjoyed her company. The thing people don\u2019t get with Henry VIII is that he wasn\u2019t a big womaniser, He was an intelligent man who liked intelligent women. No one expected him to become king so he\u2019d been raised by his mother and sisters, not his father. Once he didn\u2019t have to produce a child with Anne, she became a bit like an aunt to his children and Henry found that he could talk to her. I think it was actually a bit of a relief for him, because she wasn\u2019t allied with any scheming English family trying to get favours from him. Nor did he have to deal with her foreign relatives politically. So he could chat to her without having to watch whatever he said. And she stayed in England because she preferred it to Cleves, I think for much the same reason. I think it was a case of \u2018hey baby, I dig you, just not like that\u2026!\u2019 ",

She wouldn\u2019t have been beheaded - her family was relatively powerful and Henry was relying on them and other German Dukedoms to be his allies against Catholic Spain and France) Fight Henry every step of the way and risk a fate similar to Catherine of Aragon. Life in a isolated house, with a poor income generated from said house and reliant on the goodwill and charity of others (and Anne hadn\u2019t been in England long enough to build up that level of loyalty with her Household)Submit to Henry\u2019s will (with a token protest not to seem to eager to get out of the marriage), and be rewarded with a generous settlement, the means to live an independent life comfortably, and retain a place of status at the Court when she chose to attend (even if it means having to set aside any hopes of marriage and children because no man would marry the women who a King couldn\u2019t bring himself to bed).She could see which way the wind was blowing, could see the hand she had to play and played an absolute blinder with them - escaping with her life, wealth and independence\u2026 and, perhaps, she was playing that game from the moment she met Henry VIII\u2026 ",

Hence the King felt like he could still be friendly towards her after annulment. He even gave her choice to either return to Cleves or stay in England and receive generous sum from him. Anne chose to stay. She got indipendence (able to be her own free rich woman) and perhaps living in England was more fun(she was brought up in very old-fashioned household, with strict rules). And she didn\u2019t have to worry about King choping her head off at this point\u2026 And of course it made Henry VIII look better if he was getting along well with her, so he often invited her to court, though I don\u2019t think she was at court year round, just special occasions.

            "answer_text": "One thing to realize about the two queens who he divorced was that both Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves were foreign royals. To kill them would have been risking war with Spain/Holy Roman Empire and a German Duchy. Catherine refused to accept the annulment and as such had to be sent away in exile until her death. Anne of Cleves, on the other hand, accepted the annulment and was rewarded for it. She was also given the Boleyns\u2019 old house and a place as his \u201cbeloved sister\u201d or some other courtly nonsense. This made sense because she would have known how to act at court, and she was wise enough to never speak against Henry so he saw her as a positive addition to his court, just not as a wife. I\u2019m sure when poor Catherine Howard was running up the halls crying, Henry regretted not just staying with Anne of Cleves in the first place. ",

Look at his next wife, the fun loving sexually charged 17 year old Catherine. However, Henry could not risk angering Anne and her family that helped run the Protestant league, so he made her a great offer. She got a castle, land, money and could do what she pleased if she would just agree to annul the marriage and become a royal sister. As Anne grew up, got wiser and had fun with it, Henry ended up liking her as a person instead of a wife with all the pressures and pitfalls. They became great friends and some say they had a brief affair\u2026Henry cheated on his girlfriend with his old wife, that's a new one! ",

My impression is that he simply found a relationship with her restful and uncomplicated. He didn't find her sexually attractive, so it was possible for her to be simply a good friend, a friendship with absolutely no strings attached. She was known in Court as \u2018the King\u2019s Sister,\u2019 and lived comfortably and safely; she was the longest-lived of his assorted wives, outlasting Henry himself and Kathryn Parr, and his having rejected her as a partner in bed was undoubtedly her luckiest escape. I don't think there was anything more complicated to it than a cheerfully platonic relationship. ",

At Henry\u2019s first Christmas Court after his marriage to Katherine Howard, Anne attended the celebrations, brought lavish gifts, and made a grand show of the amity between herself and the Royal Couple. It was political theater of the best kind for Henry. And Henry could point to the deference Anne was shown, and the generous settlement he had given her, as proof that he had dissolved their marriage because of his conscience, not because he\u2019d fallen for a nubile teenager. Once the danger of her resisting the end of their marriage was over, Henry actually quite liked her. ",

He appreciated the fact that she didn\u2019t resist or make a big deal of his wanting a divorce. She was probably the luckiest of all his wives. She had her own home, servants, money, and independence. That was hard to obtain for women back then. ",

Anne knew that she could fight Henry\u2019s planned annulment of their marriage, but the odds of success weren\u2019t great. She also knew that Henry could be generous to those who gave him what he wanted. It helped that Anne of Cleves didn\u2019t have a child\u2019s rights and wellbeing in question, or any personal history or sentiment involved, as Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn did, so the choice was a lot easier for her. Look at how it went: Anne agrees to an annulment on the grounds that the marriage was never consummated, and she gets to remain in England (as opposed to being sent home and married off to someone else), is given her own estates, and honoured above nearly every woman in court as \u201cthe king\u2019s sister\u201d. All for the price of not putting up a fight. I\u2019d say Anne did quite well for herself. ",
