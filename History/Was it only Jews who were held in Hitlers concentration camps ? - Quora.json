            "answer_text": "No. The first concentration camps were established amid considerable publicity in March 1933 for opponents (real and imaginary) of the Nazi r\u00e9gime: Communists, Social Democrats, left-leaning liberal politicians, trade union leaders, etc and not for Jews. (Of course, some of these people were also Jews, but that wasn\u2019t the reason why they were sent to camps at that stage). Many of the early camps were closed down in late 1933 and in 1934. Later various other categories of people were also sent to concentration camps, such as some long-term unemployed people, sex offenders and vagrants as well as \u2018social misfits\u2019. The first time in Nazi Germany that a large number of Jews were sent to concentration camps simply for being Jews was in the immediate aftermath of the Night of Broken Glass (November 1938). It is very important to distinguish between ordinary concentration camps and extermination camps. The purpose of the latter was to kill - mainly Jews and Roma, whereas the former were intended to deter, intimidate and punish*. From about 1939 onwards the number of concentration camps was greatly expanded to create a vast pool of slave labour. *The Auschwitz group of camps and Majdanek combined both functions. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. The first concentration camps, like Dachau, were intended for political prisoners, criminals, any group the Nazis deemed \u201csocially undesirable\u201d like homosexuals, intellectual critics of the regime, trade unionists, and members of Marxist parties like the Social Democrats and the Communists. The first concentration camps were not designed for mass extermination, although many millions perished in them in the twelve years of the Third Reich in spite of that. Dachau, for instance, easily saw over 100,000 deaths from shooting, hanging, torture, slave labor, malnutrition and extended physical abuse and overwork. The extermination camps, like Auschwitz, were designed with the Jews in mind, but again Jews were not the only victims of these camps. Keep in mind, however, that once the Holocaust began in earnest, after the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, Jews were overwhelmingly the primary target of extermination. ",
