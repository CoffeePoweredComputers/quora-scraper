            "answer_text": "Everyone gave Trump ZERO chance to win in 2016, so certainly Trump\u2019s odds of winning in 2020 are better than that. Let\u2019s try to be objective. Most of the answers so far are either bias wishful thinking or just missing the forest through the trees. I think the question is this: Are there any votes Trump had in 2016 that he won\u2019t have in 2020? Economy: If the world stays on its current trajectory, by the time we get to November the election is going to be about the economy. We have 40,000,000 unemployed Americans that had jobs two months ago. It is unlikely that even 10,000,000 will be re-employed by November. I don\u2019t think many grasp just how unprecedented that is, it has NEVER happened. The country will be in a recession by November but on an upward trajectory. Like it or not, Trump has a good record on the economy and talks a really good game. The Democrats (Biden) are likely to go all-in on promising pie in the sky programs ($2000 per month for all unemployed, medicare for all, free college etc.). Those sorts of ideas don\u2019t play well in the mid-west swing states. The Democrats can\u2019t help themselves but swing way left on the economy. Trump will knock them out. We have already committed upwards of $7 Trillion between Congress and Federal Reserve, I think many voters will say enough is enough, just make it so I can get back to work. That sentiment is like gasoline to Trump\u2019s fire and just plays to his hand. When an election is about the economy, Democrats tend to lose. Trump Fatigue: Trump, is a polarizing figure, no doubt. Some of that is real, some of that is manufactured by his opposition. Some parts of the electorate who might be inclined to vote for Trump may decide not to do so because they want to try to put an end to the drama. I think this factor is the wild-card. We have had 4+ years of Trump-bashing, investigations, and manufactured drama. The question is to what extent have voters bought or not bought into that narrative. Trump doesn\u2019t necessarily help the situation. He fans the flames. I think there is a risk he loses moderates that would vote for him for economic reasons but may be unwilling to bring themselves to do it again. Perhaps there are some voters who gave Trump the benefit of doubt, but after four years, the shine has worn off. Biden is his own worst enemy: Biden isn\u2019t actually a bad candidate to go against Trump. Biden is scrappy and will speak his mind from time to time. I kind of respect him for telling voters they are full of shit. However, that usually doesn\u2019t work out for him too well, but remember, Trump won by doing that. However, Biden has a slew of issues. I just don\u2019t see him doing well nationally, Long term Senators (1973 to 2009) just don\u2019t seem to do well in national elections. Also, that gives his opposition a L-O-N-G history to dig up. Aside from Biden not being Trump, why would you vote for him? So far, I don\u2019t have an answer to that question. Who does Biden bring to the table that isn\u2019t already there? That is a big problem for Democrats going into 2020. Same issues as 2016: The same issues that got Trump elected in 2016 are still here. Like it or not, you still have an extremely biased media that has doubled down and is now in open opposition. The perceived elites have gone all-in on preaching to the labeled deplorables, which has been exacerbated by COVID with those with jobs telling those without to shut-up, stay-home, and wear maks, which plays into Trump\u2019s hand. Democrats completely blew-it with the defund the police slogan. The polling is 2 to 1 against that. People support police reform and, in general, support police. Democrats made what could have been a good issue for them a loser. It might help them keep the Black vote in the short term, but they risk losing moderate white voters. Edit (August 2020). Rioting and Looting. As much as certain media outlets try to gloss over what is happening, there is real, and so far fairly consistent, rioting, looting, and lawlessness occurring. I believe that helps Trump especially given that the Democrats are rather complacent about it. The scenes of businesses on fire may just scare the swing state moderates back to Trump. There just isn\u2019t a Democratic narrative or spin to mitigate that issue. They would have to stand up for law and order, but that is unlikely to happen since they went all-in on the defund the police slogan. Between Trump\u2019s record on the economy and backlash against elitism, it is hard to see where Trump loses any of the votes he had in 2016. The Democrats will have the same issue as they did in 2016, but I think worse. They are running a candidate that few people are excited about. At least Hillary had the vote for me because I am a woman vote, but Biden won\u2019t have any of that. He doesn\u2019t have a hook. Biden appears to be looking to have a woman of color as his VP, but that won\u2019t matter, Presidential elections are not won based on who is VP. Biden will get the vote of those that already don\u2019t like Trump. Right now, I don\u2019t see that as being enough to win the election because it wasn\u2019t enough in 2016. Right now it seems that the Democrats are just hoping that there are some voters who hated Clinton, dislike Trump, but voted for him because they hated Clinton more, and who are going to be okay with Biden. Frankly, who are those people? I don\u2019t think those voters exist or if they do, the numbers are small. Five months is a long time. A lot can happen between now and then. Absent a 3rd party candidate that would split Republican votes, I think the chances are pretty good that we see a repeat of 2016. Who are the Democrats thinking will show-up in 2020 that didn\u2019t show up in 2016? Let\u2019s be honest, the Democratic party has a fracture. The militant side is going around burning cities and defacing statues, but they don\u2019t show up at the voting booth. Conversely, who do you really think Trump has lost since 2016 that are going to pull the lever for Biden? ",

            "answer_text": "I have lived in Michigan my entire life and have been asking a lot of people this same question. I\u2019m really trying to figure this out too because I know Michigan could be a crucial swing state because Trump had a statistical tie with HRC (47% to 47% vs HRC; 4% were \u201cother\u201d)\u2026. winning Michigan by 0.23% of the vote in 2016. Almost everyone I ask thinks he will win again, which I believe reflects what they are seeing in Michigan. While my college educated friends and family were excitedly watching the impeachment vote, Trump seemed to trump the Democrats again with a huge rally in Battle Creek, Michigan \u2026 which many of my social media \u201cfriends\u201d were \u201cliking\u201d. The people I know who voted for Trump are planning to vote for him again. This includes white educated business owners (mostly men, their wives may split the ticket); white non-college educated men, Indian Americans, Muslim Americans, Jewish Americans, Catholics, many people I know with a gun etc. He annihilated HRC in Macomb County, widely considered \u201cworking class\u201d and white and supposedly a \u201cswing county\u201d. He\u2019s there all\u2026. the \u2026. time\u2026 its seems like. As are his kids. Some people voted for him but say they will not in 2020 and those few seem most bothered by his behavior and some say his refusal to acknowledge the science of climate change. I don\u2019t think everyone is so impressed with the economy around her either (which I blame less on politicians and more on GM/Ford/Chrysler\u2019s seeming inability to make cars that consumers actually want to buy). For those who say they \u201cmight not\u201d vote for Trump again\u2026 I ask \u201cso would you vote for Elizabeth Warren?\u201d and people almost always say a strong \u201cNO\u201d\u2026. same adamant \u201cNO\u201d for Biden (except some Baby Boomers who were going to vote for the Democrat anyway). I don\u2019t hear anyone saying Warren or Biden would take their vote away from Trump. The most positive \u201cswing voter\u201d responses seem to be regarding wanting to \u201clearn more about Bloomberg\u201d (the educated suburban voters I know) \u2026. so I am starting to think Bloomberg could take Michigan Trump voters from him in a 2 way race\u2026 and I hear \u201cI like Bernie\u201d (less college educated \u2026. the college educated around her seem to really dislike him)\u2026and some interest in Andrew Yang from everyone who knows something about him. My most educated friends like Buttigieg by far the most, but those were people who were going to vote for the Democrat anyway (I have not talked to a single Trump voter who said they would vote for Buttigieg). I don\u2019t understand the visceral negative reaction to Elizabeth Warren but it\u2019s real around here (from Democrats\u2026.). Biden has made one too many gaffes and most I talk to say \u201che\u2019s too old\u201d\u2026. but it seems like the Democrats I talk to would come out and vote for him if he is the nominee. It also seems that all of the young people I know will vote exactly as their parents do (only a few voting Democratic when their parents are voting Republican but those have moved to blue states). There is a group of kids I know from University of Michigan who live in blue states but have chosen to register to vote here \u2026. so that could be interesting if that group really mobilizes (Trump\u2019s 0.23% over HRC represented 10,704 votes and there are about 24,000 out of state students at University of Michigan\u2026 and a small sample size recently found 13% are Republican, 42% are Democratic and 25% are Independent). I think I\u2019m hitting a pretty good cross section. If I had to guess right now, I would say: Bloomberg could beat Trump in Michigan b/c he would take just enough Republicans/people who voted for Trump last time. Sanders could win Michigan but it\u2019s scary because the suburban Democrat may do a protest stay at home vote. That group that I talk to feels very strongly against Bernie (I\u2019m in that cohort and love Bernie but am only finding supporters among non college educated and some young voters). :Though Sanders could take the Trump swing voter in Michigan for sure. Sanders won our primary vs. HRC in 2016. I think Sanders/Bloomberg or Bloomberg/Sanders could be really interesting if they would ever agree to it and I believe that ticket could win Michigan. I\u2019m not worried that they are 2 older Jewish guys, I think these 2 particular men could excite a lot of people around here (if they are together). I think Bloomberg/Buttigieg or the other way around could be a disaster because the Democrats might not get the Democrat minority vote\u2026 and I\u2019m having a hard time seeing how that ticket excites non-educated voters\u2026 but maybe that gets enough Republicans/people who voted for Trump (though I worry our \u201cbible belt\u201d will not vote for a Jewish guy and a gay guy over Trump\u2026. hopefully I\u2019m wrong). I think Sanders/Yang or Bloomberg/Yang could win. Anyone who knows about Andrew Yang around here seems to like him. I find him so lovely in the debates and he is the only one talking about AI and \u201cresearching nuclear energy\u201d and really helping people NOW who are already affected by climate change and globalization etc.; I read his book and think that anyone who reads it or understands his compassion for underemployed men, homemakers, disabled and the geographically unlucky (those of us in manufacturing states or those of us affected by climate change\u2026.) would be a fan. Unfortunately I do not think Elizabeth Warren can win Michigan (and I really like her). Reminds me of the HRC reaction around here; I could not talk people out of that one. Warren really bothers people I know (including Democrats and a lot of women, unfortunately); Bernie does too but he also seems to have more devoted fans than she does. Biden could win Michigan but most are very concerned about his ability to reach the finish line so I am hopeful the Democrats do not just anoint him like they did with HRC. If Biden would put Andrew Yang on the ticket, I think it would be super interesting too but I\u2019m guessing he will pick one of the moderates (Klobuchar or Harris) and I\u2019m worried that will not excite \u201cthe base\u201d or sway the \u201cnot always Republican Trump voter\u201d. I have not heard much talk about Klobuchar but I think her debate performances get better and better. Hopefully I\u2019m wrong on Biden if he is the nominee. It\u2019s after all, a very small margin he would need to win by to get Michigan\u2019s electoral votes from Trump. The baby boomer Michigan Democrats and \u201cparty people\u201d who I speak to in Michigan have already decided on Biden. I sure hope that works and that he holds up if he\u2019s the nominee. & an excited base is going to be key for the Democrats because we are also the only \u201cswing state\u201d with a Democrat Senator (Gary Peters) up for reelection and he is running against a charismatic African American man (from Detroit, went to West Point) who did quite well against Senator Stabenow last election so he has name recognition and the Michigan Republican party very much behind him. If the Michigan Democrats do not show up then not only does Trump likely win here, but Michigan could lose our Democratic Senator. What do other Michiganders or people who know Michigan think? Or do others have friends, family and work colleagues in Michigan and have you talked to them about this? Do you think Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden can beat Trump in Michigan? ",
