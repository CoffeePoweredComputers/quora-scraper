            "answer_text": "One of the lesser known invention which is really a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the field of \u201crenewable energy\u201d and \u201csustainable development\u201d is the \u201cpiezoelectric tiles\u201d.  \u201cPiezoelectricity is the ability of a material to generate an internal electric field when subjected to mechanical stress or strain. The tiles work in a way that whenever a person steps on those tiles the energy from the pressure of the step converts to an electric-charge which can then be used to give electricity to various equipment around.  I believe a technology like this can prove to be useful in public spaces like railway stations, airports etc. This way wasted kinetic energy of human can be turn into electricity, which is very useful in India.
