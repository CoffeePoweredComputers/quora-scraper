            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an odd conclusion to reach from that data. Every institution and person has some level of bias. Bias is normal. But to see fault in an American magazine including each of the American presidents in its annual issues that, according to TIME, profile \u201cthe person who had the greatest influence, for better or worse, on the events of the year.\u201d is odd. It would be very surprising if, during the four to eight years that a person is the President of the United States of America, that that person is not, at least once, the person that has the greatest influence on the events of the year. The President of the United States is quite often referred to as the most powerful person in the world and as the leader of the free world. For better or for worse, America, for the ninety years that TIME has been naming a person of the year, has been extremely influential on the events of the year. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Time is an American magazine. It looks at the world from an American viewpoint, i.e. with an American bias. But naming someone Person of the Year does not imply approval. It merely says that person has dominated the year. Like him or loathe him, I think it would be hard to deny that Donald Trump has dominated the news of the past year. And, from an American point of view, Presidents and Presidential campaigns are extremely important. ",
