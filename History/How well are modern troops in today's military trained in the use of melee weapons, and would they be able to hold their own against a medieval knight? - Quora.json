            "answer_text": "Without his rifle, the modern soldier stands about as much chance as a snowman facing a chainsaw wielding Mike Tyson in hell. While modern soldiers have some close combat training, I'd like to emphasize the word SOME there. It's a minor part of their training, not at all the focus. This is true even for special forces, who receive more CQC training than most, but still focus far more on modern weapons.  A knight, on the other hand, has been trained in melee combat since he was a child. Melee combat is their job, their ONLY job. They do it until they either die in battle or grow so old they can't fight anymore.  Also, the melee weapons employed by your modern soldier are going to be woefully inadequate to stop a knight with any reliability. While a dagger (which a modern fighting knife is an example of) is capable of doing the job in certain circumstances, the chances of being able to get a kill shot on an armored, angry, well trained man who is not only familiar with the use of daggers, but actively resisting is low. I very much doubt our soldier knows any dagger techniques that the knight does not know how to counter. Also, given his armor, the knight could simply grab the weapon or the hand of the modern soldier and then gut him like a fish. This is a demonstration of 14th century dagger fighting:  It's likely the knight knows something very similar to that.  Meanwhile, our soldier's cloth body armor is going to provide little protection against a knight's weapons. Cutting and stabbing attacks are one of the weaknesses of kevlar. Even if the knight's first blows were deflected by the ceramic plates in the armor, the knight is used to fighting armored opponents, and it won't take him long to figure out our soldier's limbs and neck are soft. Now, I know some of you are thinking, all the soldier has to do is stay away from the knight, and the big brute will tire. While this is to a certain extent true (everyone tires eventually, no matter how well trained), you must understand that not only is a knight very well conditioned for melee combat (it is, again, his job) but he is significantly less encumbered than you may believe. Going off surviving examples of plate mail, suits ranged from 65-85lbs, depending on the size and the era. This is in the same sort of range as our soldier would be carrying for a combat load, and the knight's armor is spread across his entire body. His armor is also tailored for him, and the suit actually has a higher ROM than the human body is capable of. Knights would regularly perform tumbling routines in full armor at tournaments, and it was not uncommon for them to vault onto their horses for the joust.  Here's an example of a regular guy doing exercises and acrobatics in an off the shelf suit of armor. A knight would be stronger and have a better fitting suit:  Likewise, the knight's weapons are not nearly as heavy as the media would have you believe. Many swords were as light as 3lbs, with your larger hand and a half sword generally being closer to 5. A sword owned by a knight is likely well made, sharp, and balanced. It is not a crude hacking weapon, but a strong and agile blade, capable of lightning fast attack and defense. A good swing from a sword can easily sever a limb or cut a deep cavity into anyone unfortunate enough to be at the receiving end. The knight is also an expert in it's use. Besides the lance, the sword is his signature weapon. If we assume both have their regular equipment, minus ranged weapons, then we must also mention the lance. Your average knight would be wielding a lance on horseback as his primary weapon. Essentially a spear on steroids, lances were generally 10-12 and sometimes as much as 16 feet long, tipped with a steel point and couched for impact support. With this, the knight can run down the soldier with ease. The soldier's vest won't stop the impact of a lance to the chest delivered at a full gallop, and the knight has been training to hit that shot since he was a child. Our modern soldier is also unlikely to be able to defeat the knight with grappling. Knights were not ignorant of grappling in the least, as is evidenced by period fighting manuals. There were actually a variety of unarmed and hybrid styles in Europe at the time. One of which, Kampfringen is seen here:    It is extensively documented and resembles Judo and MMA. They even had mounted grappling techniques.  So, if our soldier tries any slick grappling moves, he faces a good chance of being countered and taking either an armored fist or a dagger to the face.  Barring some incredible stroke of luck, the knight wins this fight far more often than he loses. It's not to take anything away from our modern soldier, but he's a gun fighter fighting with no gun.  I think it's important to understand the impact firearms had on warfare. Once guns became good enough to reliably defeat armor (and that did take some time, by the way) war started to change dramatically. Not just in weapons and tactics, but in who fought them. See, it takes a very long time to become proficient with melee weapons. To get really good, you need to train for decades. Sure, you can take an average, reasonably fit person and teach them how to thrust and parry, but without decades of training, they will lose to someone of the caliber of a knight. So, it used to be that the only people who had the time and resources to dedicate their lives to fighting were the nobility. Peasants had far more important things to worry about, like not starving. So the nobility ruled the battlefield, because they had the time and money to train. Guns changed that. You can take any reasonably healthy young man, and within a span of 3 or 4 months, he can be turned into a well trained, competent soldier. Guns have made killing so much easier that just about anyone can be turned into a soldier quickly. The young farmboy who would have been cut to pieces by the knight in the past now possesses weapons so easy to use and so powerful that he needs not fear the landed gentry. So, give our soldier his rifle and he blows the knight away with ease. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm sorry to say it, but I must disagree with Jon Davis\u2019 belief that modern Marines have a lot of hand to hand training. We really don't. MCMAP teaches you enough for you to look nice while you get your ass kicked. It teaches you to punch. I kid you not. Unless you're getting up to the more advanced belts, aka black and black with red tabs or tan tabs, they send you to a dedicated school for the tabs so I'd hope that you would get better training. MCMAP is instructed by other members of your unit. I'll say that again. Other members of your unit. Can anyone else think of a problem here? Your best buddy is teaching a class of 20 or more Marines MCMAP, you walk up to him and say something along the lines of, \u201cHey man, hook it up\u201d. You walk away with the next higher belt. Or it's someone you don't know and owe him a favor or pay him. This happens daily. Daily. The only members of the Marine Corps that have (real) hand to hand training are MARSOC and Force Recon, guys who are black belt and up, and those that had training prior to joining. If the Marine Corps taught you how to fight then I'm sorry but you lose will almost any meaningful encounter if you try to use it. Oh they teach you moves, which Marines memorize for the test and promptly forget everything afterwards. MCMAP doesn't teach Marines to kill. It doesn't. Even when we're being trained we spend around 25\u201330 minutes learning the moves for that belt and then dudes groundfight each other. You know what that groundfighting looks like? Less disciplined than a middle school wrestling match. I don't even mean this a disrespect to middle schoolers. The instructor teaches you the moves. Then you all stand in a circle and fight each other. It usually denigrates quickly into obvious pathways. Former wrestlers against former wrestlers, so less experienced guys don't learn. Inexperienced Marine against inexperienced Marine, again no one really learns. Occasionally former wrestler against inexperienced Marine, he doesn't learn because he gets destroyed too quickly. Not to mention the fact that when you are legitimately groundfighting I have seen, in all of my 6 years and literally hundreds of MCMAP sessions, an instance of someone using a MCMAP move while groundfighting once. Once. I am not exaggerating that either. It was actually last year and I remember it because I was surprised that it happened. Ok so to answer the question I'll use a modern Marine (0311) as the metric here. Sorry cyberwar and legal admin guys. Well take a look:  The only things actually protected here are his chest and back and his head.  Homeboy here has a lot more than just his chest and head covered. He has a sword which is several feet long. We have a blade (that we are barely trained on even) that is ten-inches long. The only way a modern day Marine would actually win this fight is if you toppled the knight and while he was down stabbed him, quite literally, in his face. I love Marines but if I had to bet on a winner between an average Marine and an average knight, I'll take the knight 9/10 times ",
