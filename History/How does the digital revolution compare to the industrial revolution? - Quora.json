            "answer_text": "Without question details, there are two very significant ways to interpret this question that immediately come to mind. These are \"Is the digital revolution similar in comparison to the industrial revolution?\" and \"Does the digitial revolution compare favorably to the industrial revolution?\" Given this, I am going to go ahead and do my best to try to answer both.  First, let's do a quick round of definitions. What are the Industrial Revolution and the Digital Revolution? The Industrial Revolution was a roughly 100 year long period (approx. 1750-1850) of rapid change in the means of production that drastically altered those societies that participated. It began as a result of steam power enabling muscle power to be replaced by machinery and ended with a significant restructuring of not just labor, but the entire social and political landscape built around it. The Digital Revolution is the current period of transition from a slower and more localized means of distributing information to a much more rapid and universal distribution. It began with practical computerization approximately 60 years ago and is still ongoing, with drastic alterations already observed, but with the final outcome yet to be fully realized. I'm not going to get into details on the how-tos and why-fors. Instead I'll simply do a fast pro-cons of each as currently understood, then get into the comparisons. The Industrial Revolution: Pros: Shifted the basic power for many forms of production away from muscle to mechanical, reducing wear and tear on basic laborers. Simultaneously reduced the cost of goods while making more of them readily available, thus increasing the basic quality of life. Reduced the length of the workday by reducing the number of hours needed to produce most products on an individual basis. Shifted children from laborers to learners, allowing greatly expanded education across society overall. Created enough liquidity to reduce poverty and significantly grow the size of the middle class while still expanding the capital available to industrialists and business leaders. Cons: Created vast amounts of pollution and industrial wastes in cities, particularly in poorer neighborhoods, increasing problems with disease. Shifted the typical worker from a highly trained and valued specialist to a fairly cheap, easily replaced unskilled body. Shifted society from one focused on basic needs to one focused on rampant consumerism. Population explosion. The Digital Revolution: Pros: Greatly expanded access to information necessary for political, social, and economic engagement. Expanded global consciousness to the average individual. Vastly improved ability to respond to political and business changes in a timely way. Further democratized access to education and capital. Allowed greater physical mobility and significantly reduced social costs. Cons: Information overload caused by greater access, fewer filters, and increased distribution speeds. Decreased sense of stability caused by greater awareness of statistically unlikely hazards. Loss of privacy at all levels of life to technological invasions by private and public concerns and by increasing roll of work on life outside of work. Increasingly frenetic pace of life caused by rapidly decreasing allowances for reaction time and overabundance of opportunities for social interaction. Is the Digital Revolution similar in comparison to the industrial revolution? There are certainly some similarities, but there are also distinct differences. Both have seen significant changes enter the lives of the typical worker by shifting how and when they work, and both have greatly expanded the opportunities for people to become educated and involved in bettering their standards of living. However, There have are also significant differences between the two. While the Industrial Revolution began the process of significantly damaging the environment and creating wide scale health issues, the Digital Revolution's negative effects have come at a much more personal level, by creating little space for private lives to escape from social and work pressures. Does the Industrial Revolution compare favorably to the Digital Revolution? In my opinion this is a wash. While the Industrial Revolution reduced the harsh demands on the general populace in terms of working, it did so at significant costs to people's health and ability to be content with what they had immediately to hand. The Digital Revolution has damaged some of those gains in labor conditions by increasingly demanding time away from work be spent responding to instant communications requiring instant decisions and acts, but has greatly increased opportunity for those previously not able to gain access to the education and capital they need to improve their lives. Again, these are very much my opinion, and I eagerly wait to see other responses. Very good question! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not as significant as the industrial revolution in it\u2019s actual affect on lives and countries as economist Robert Gordon points out in his new book \u201cThe Rise & Fall of American Growth\u201d. Essentially the industrial revolution grows a vast new middle class of households with rapidly increasing lifespans, quality of lives, more productive use of their assets and labor, a consumer culture, a much greater taxbase allowing that country to fund public education, higher education, advanced health care, public infrastructure, research in many fields, public amenities and parks, shrink family sizes from what made sense in high death rate/heavy labor requirements on farms, creates many new sources of wealth which displaces the land-based oligarchies and changes governance overall to more just systems, and increases military capacity for defense while making offensive war far harder. The digital revolution also sped everything up both by facilitating communications (satellites, cellular phone networks, fiber optic cables, data centers/cloud computing, Internet, communications standards and protocols shared worldwide, standardized software like Excel and Word or the World Wide Web or AutoCad) and allowing the automation of an ever increasing number of functions from how a machine tool made holes in a piece of metal unattended to driverless heavy trucks no longer restricted by a human driver\u2019s need for rest and food. It first widened the gap enormously with most countries, just like the industrial revolution did in the 1700\u2019s-1900\u2019s, and then narrowed it by making it\u2019s products and impacts readily buyable in places that couldn\u2019t make or apply these technologies themselves. The industrial revolution has continued now for 300+ years and if anything continued to gather speed (now it\u2019s using wireless communications networks from ever more sophisticated sensors creating streams of real-time big data for massive software programs to make sense of in visual displays, automatic decisions, and letting offsite suppliers, distributors, salespeople, transporters, and management know what\u2019s going on precisely and in real time instead of vaguely and many months later. While a huge amount of the digital revolution\u2019s capacity so far goes to entertainment and distraction (NetFlix consumes a third of U.S. data flow capacity so people can bingewatch old television shows, YouTube videos, porn, gossip, gaming, etc. consume much of the rest so how much real knowledge advancement or productivity is enabled is a murkier question than normally presented. ) Nobel winning economist at MIT Robert Solow posited some years ago that much of the productivity revolution routinely attributed to millions of balky PC\u2019s with erratic software in the 1980\u2019s-2000\u2019s was actually traceable back to Wal-marts\u2019 impacts on worldwide supply chain management as it became the world\u2019s largest retailer, forcing most manufacturers to upgrade to it\u2019s rapidly evolving best practices decades fasteer than they had in the past.
