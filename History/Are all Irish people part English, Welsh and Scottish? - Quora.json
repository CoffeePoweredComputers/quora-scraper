            "answer_text": "DNA analysis over the past 15 to 20 years has revealed that the people of Ireland and Great Britain (as well as much of nearby northwestern/western continental Europe) share a common genetic ancestry going back to the end of the last ice age. By the time it is appropriate to think of the Irish and (Celtic) British as separate peoples culturally, say 1500 to 2000 years ago, there were extensive interactions between Ireland and the western parts of Great Britain. For example, there are archaeological remains of Irish settlements in what is now Wales, and the Ulaid (from present-day Co. Antrim) established the kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata in western Scotland. It is reasonable to assume that there was an exchange of DNA among the Irish and the Britons at that time (though, despite their cultural/linguistic differences, both groups were still essentially identical from a genetic perspective). The ancient Irish were enthusiastic slave-raiders and brought many slaves over from Great Britain. After the fifth century AD, their victims necessarily included Anglo-Saxons, and thus we may expect that \u201cEnglish\u201d (as opposed to British) genes began to enter the Irish gene pool from then on. The importation of British/English slaves continued after the Norse established Dublin and other towns and largely superseded the Irish as slave traders. The English invaded Ireland in 1169\u201371. As the Cambro-Norman official Gerald of Wales described in his Expugnatio Hibernica (\u201cThe Conquest of Ireland\u201d) (1189), these \u201cEnglish\u201d included Normans, Flemings and Welshmen. They settled mainly in Leinster and parts of Munster, where they and their descendants often intermarried with the Irish. Surnames of medieval Anglo-Norman and Welsh origin are still common in those parts of Ireland. The late 16th and early-to-mid 17th centuries saw the influx of significant numbers of English and Scots settlers, particularly in Ulster but also in parts of Munster. The big difference between these settlers and the Irish (both of Gaelic Irish and Anglo-Norman descent) was that the newcomers were Protestant and the Irish were Catholic. This diminished the possibilities for intermarriage, especially in Ulster where the settlers had sufficient critical mass numerically to maintain a separate cultural identity. But hormones will be hormones, and a certain amount of exchange of genetic materials took place nonetheless. Of course, aside from the large influxes of English and Welsh in 1170\u20131200s and English and Scots in the 1580s-1600s, there was always a constant traffic of smaller numbers across the Irish Sea\u2014officials, soldiers, merchants, adventurers\u2014and these left their mark as well. So, to return to your question: While we may not be able to say whether all Irish people are part English, Scottish or Welsh, it is indisputable that over the course of history, strong dashes of English, Welsh and Scots seasoning were added to the genetic Irish stew. But before there ever were Irish, English, Welsh or Scots, all four peoples shared a common ancestry. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure how anyone would know, barring a nationwide genealogical search. Even then, records only go back so far. My feeling is that the religious differences between the Irish and interlopers could have preserved Irish DNA, with a few provisos: The original interlopers, the Normans, were Catholic and intermarried with the Irish - particularly in Leinster and Munster.Ulster was the last holdout of the Gaelic way of life, butUlster had strong links with Scotland anyway, andit is possible that some Irish people continued to attend the churches taken over by the planters, for want of an alternative -effectively converting to Protestantism. Quite a few clearly Irish surnames are found amongst Protestant families in Northern Ireland - O\u2019Neill, Hanlon, Doherty, Conneelly, Devenny, etc.During the Penal Laws era, there were benefits to converting to Anglicanism (i.e., you were no longer subject to the Penal Laws), and some did convert (see surnames above).There\u2019s always been some degree of intermarriage, even during Penal times - particularly amongst the wealthier classes.However, Irish DNA is not hugely different to British DNA, or for that matter European DNA generally. I\u2019ve written an answer with links to mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA findings that might be of interest. Recent DNA research on Irish travellers demonstrates that they are a distinct ethnic group within Ireland, having split from the general population in the 1500s or 1600s. This might provide a sample of (relatively) \u2018pure\u2019 Irish DNA against which other UK and Irish samples may be compared, but I don\u2019t know if anyone has tried so far. ",

While not a complete picture the fact that over 80% of the population of Ireland are in the R1b haplogroup. With over 90% in Munster belonging to it. Now a large portion of England also shares this group, as does Wales and Scotland. It is the marker of the original population of these areas, so people with this marker could have settled in Ireland from England and Wales or Scotland. However what it, and other historical evidence demonstrates is that the overall population movements were very low of the hundreds of years, not enough to seriously alter the genetic makeup of Ireland. The fact that other markers found in the UK are much lower here would indicate that there wasnt much of an impact from English, Welsh or Scottish settlement.  There is a a higher proportion of non Gaelic surnames though, and this is simply down to the fact that those settlers did come, and often ruled over large groups of indigenous Irish. People often ended up taking the surname of the sept/Clan/Lord who ruled over them and/ or Anglicizing Most people like to claim to be descended from these noble family's, but in all likelihood they are not. Take my own name, Carr, which is an Anglicization of the Gaelic name Mac Giolla Chearra. Now it is highly unlikely that I am descended from the Clan that bore that name, much more likely from some people who worked their land. In general the population of Ireland is a lot less exotic than people like to make out. ",

            "answer_text": "If we all go back to ancient times (and as a rule), ancient Britain and Caledonia (Scotland) were inhabited by Celtic tribes when the Romans colonized the island. Both Britain and Hibernia (Ireland) were Celtic. It was not until after around 500 A.D. that a cultural stew was beginning. German tribes like the Angles and Saxons (the former is where England got its name) Jutes from Denmark and the Vikings all left their imprint culturally. The Scots (ancient tribe) were originally from Ireland and came to Caledonia around the same time. The Picts were another Celtic tribe already there and were later absorbed by the Scots. Then you have the English Normans (French and Viking), who invaded both Scotland and later Ireland in the 12th century (and the subsequent English colonization centuries later). An example of the Anglo-Norman influence on Irish culture is the Irish surname of \u2018Burke\u2019 and its variants (the name itself derives from Germanic burg, meaning a fortified place). Yes, some Irish people may have multicultural ancestry. ",

It\u2019s not like in Australia, New Zealand, Canada etc where when the British arrived on boats, the native population was overpowered and replaced as a majority with a white British population. The native Irish have never gone anywhere, despite efforts down the years, like Oliver Cromwell\u2019s rally of \u201cTo Hell or to Connaught\u201d, where he tried to hem the native population into a fifth of the countries land and plant British settlers into the rest of the land. This was done successfully in the north, which is why Ireland is split into 2 to this day. If you go back far enough, Ireland was first inhabited by people travelling on land-bridges from Britain in 7000BC, when Ireland wasn\u2019t an island at the time. However, Britain itself was also inhabited by Europeans who travelled on land bridges. So are Irish people part British or are we part Belgian, French, German etc? A historian could answer better. ",

Many people in Ireland interbred only with other people from Ireland in the past one or two thousand years, so some Irish people are therefore Irish. But it safe to say that the prehistoric hunter gatherers of the early British Isles would have travelled and interbred, and so Irish, Welsh, Scots and English are all pretty closely related. Once the peoples of the Isles become farmers, there\u2019s a lot less movement and travel - many people live their entire lives within a 10 mile radius. But there have been lots of waves of immigration and settlement and conquest from lots of parts of Europe to lots of parts of the British Isles, so there are periods where genepools get mixed from all over, then periods where they don;t mix. In my own case, of my 8 great-grandparents, 1 is Irish, 1 is Welsh, 1 in English, 5 are Scots. ",
