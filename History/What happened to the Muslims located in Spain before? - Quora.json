            "answer_text": "I will assume you asked about the reconquest. By 1492, when the last Muslim kingdom of Granada was taken by the Catholic kings Ferdinand and Isabella, there were just a very few Arabs, Berbers, Almohads and Almoravids in Spain. The majority of Arabs, Almohads and Almoravids had already left Spain some centuries before. There were, however many Muslims left in Spain and not only in the Kingdom of Granada, but scattered throughout all kingdoms of Spain. They were called mudejars if they still continued being Muslims or moriscos if they were already Muslims converted to Christianity. In both cases, the very large majority of those mudejars and moriscos, were Spaniards that during the Muslim rule converted to Islam but remained Muslims, the mudejars, or reconverted back to Christianity in the case of moriscos. After the conquest of the Kingdom of Granada, all of them were allowed to remain, but due to some conflicts between Christians and Muslims, some of them, like the former King of Granada and his family, servants and some of his vassals, mainly of North African ancestry, decided to leave Spain voluntarily. sell their properties to the Spanish Kings and go to Morocco. Later, during the 16th century, the lives of those still remaining in Spain, both Mudejars and Moriscos, became gradually tougher. They were forbidden to write, keep, read or trade books written in Arab, including the Quran, were forced to changed their ethnic dresses for clothes similar to those worn by Christians, speaking Arab was forbidden, conversion to Christianity was mandatory, plus other similar restrictions. This situation created some insurgencies within the Muslim community, so in 1609 king Phillip III decreed the expulsion from all of their kingdoms (Navarre, Castile, Aragon or Granada) of all Muslims, including Moriscos except if any could prove their Christian faith for some generations, sometimes only available to those with enough money to buy false documents and witnesses.  Expulsion of Moriscos in the Valencia harbor in 1609. These Muslims expelled went to several countries in North Africa, mainly Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, but, contrary to what happened with the Jews expelled in then 15th century, they were not well received in some cases. In these cases, some Moriscos eventually became pirates and started to attack Spanish ships and even coastal towns and cities to take people as slaves to sell them, usually in Oran (Algeria). One of those groups or pirates was so significant that they even had their own republic, \u201cRepublic of Sale\u201d in Morocco, totally independent from the Sultan of Morocco.  Republic of Sale But also, many of those expelled, when faced with difficulties in their new residence, attempted to return to Spain, to their original town of residence before their expulsion. They came back,disguised as old Christians of course , usually as pilgrims, to avoid any identification by the inquisition as former Muslims. That is the case mentioned in the 2nd part of Don Quixote, by Miguel de Cervantes, written in 1615, just six years after the expulsion, where there are several pages detailing how Sancho meets a Morisco he knew, named Ricote. He tells Sancho that he\u2019s coming back to his town, dressed as a French pilgrim and speaking a perfect Spanish.  When these people reached their towns in Spain, they were usually assisted by their former neighbors, hidden from the inquisition and could remain in Spain thereafter. ",
