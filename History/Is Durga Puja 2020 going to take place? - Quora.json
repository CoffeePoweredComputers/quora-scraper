            "answer_text": "Yes of course! Amid this pandemic situation, almost all festivals have been celebrated and are being celebrated all over India, but in a humbler way and with certain necessary restrictions and precautions in place. Newer concepts and ways of celebration are being thought of and implemented on various occasions from time to time. Durga Puja in 2020 would probably see less elaborate pandals and smaller idols of deities, with a view to reducing the expenses as well as preempting huge crowds. Some Puja committees are coming up with effective and innovative ideas, such as introducing \u201cdrive through\u201d facilities for pandal hoppers and arranging for the spraying of disinfectant/sanitizer from spouts at the entrance of pandals. Like in all other aspects of life, this pandemic will not stop us from taking part in festivities but will change the accustomed way of doing so. ",

Although this year due to the covid 19 pandemic, the celebrations will not be possible on a large scale , but yet we can't leave aside the biggest festival of the state. So let's for a change stop pandal hopping this year ! Obeying health and sanitation norms, we can still have the fun in our community puja within our locality! Many puja committees have already reduced their budget and are contributing to Covid 19 relief fund, which is the much need of the time! Finally i would say that bengali can't live without durgapujo ! Pujo toh hobei\u263a\ufe0f ",
