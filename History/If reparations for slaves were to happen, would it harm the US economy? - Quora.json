            "answer_text": "Reparations would probably not harm the economy, but Dawn Cline is wrong about nearly everything else! The Struggle Against Poverty Needs to Be a Collective Fight I\u2019m against reparations for blacks, as well, but would support measures to help as many of the economically challenged as possible\u2026.. including those worldwide. This is written by a black writer at a liberal, reputable source. \u201cAt the same time, the House Budget Committee held a hearing on poverty in America, which drew a fraction of the media coverage. In that hearing, the economic disadvantages facing African Americans were only part of the story\u2014because less than one-quarter of Americans living in poverty are black. Slavery, and the systemic racism that has disadvantaged blacks in its aftermath, cannot be forgiven or forgotten. But reparations are not the answer. We cannot fix these injustices by emulating the my-race-first policies that birthed it. While the suffering of blacks hits close to home for me, it also pains me to see someone of another race or ethnicity degraded by the way our country forces poor people to live. When blacks demand that our poverty be alleviated, it\u2019s simply a matter of one race prioritizing its path to living well, when we should be fighting for everyone to live well. More whites live in poverty than people of any other ethnic or racial group; a higher percentage of Native Americans live in poverty than members of any other ethnicity. Poverty isn\u2019t a black problem, but an American problem, One goal of reparations is to close this gap. But that adopts the logic of oligarchy, instead of challenging it.\u201d BLacks already get investment. \u201ccities investing in black businesses schools, parks, cleaning up neighborhoods that are purposely left behind.\u201d Any school that fucking doesn\u2019t, the naacp would\u2019ve demanded the gov did it already. Nonprofits could demand it and persuade voters to demand that the gov to invest in fixing parks that are dangerous. Schools in wealthier neighborhoods get better investment \u2019cause property taxes pay for it. Poor blacks get welfare, too. People don\u2019t want to invest in some small businesses \u2019cause wal mart is crushing them. Thomas Stanley, phd in business wrote about this in his series of books. He spend decades studying self-made millionaries. The gov LOANS businesses. Banks authorize loans, too. Though illegal, they discriminate sometimes and charge higher fees other times for non-whites. Non-city communites exist and unless it\u2019s a biohazard, people can clean up after themselves\u2026. in their own neighborhood. I\u2019ve met 5 white saviors. Not only refuse do they refuse to acknowledge the success and progress of minorities and white women, but when asked how they actually helped anyone, they don\u2019t answer\u2026.. \u2019cause it\u2019s all about them. People who actually help bother to study the problems. \u201cThe term white savior, sometimes combined with savior complex to write white savior complex, refers to a white person who provides help to non-white people in a self-serving manner. The role is considered a modern-day version of what is expressed in the poem \"The White Man's Burden\" by Rudyard Kipling. \u201cWikipedia Obviously, there can never be equal justice \u2019cause some cops are racist and would lie on thestand. Most cops are whites, so less likely to occur for whites. Racist educators and judges exist, too. (The judge can choose to allow testimonies of racist officers.)You know how sentencing works? They can choose more harsh terms. ie voluntary manslaughter 3\u20135. Blacks and Hispanic are more likely to be suspended or even expelled for doing similar things as whites even though it\u2019s been illegal for there to be educational discrimination for decades.They\u2019re less likely to placed in honors or advanced placement classes despite test scores justifying it. Rich people have better access to healthcare \u2019cause they can afford it. Some drs reject low paying insurance. Concierge drs r less overworked and have a large retaining fee. Obviously, investing doesn\u2019t help everyone. Vulture capitalists like MITT FUCKING ROMNEY would lose out. They make $ when businesses fail. Healthcare ceos would make $ \u2019cause people w/better access spend less $ on healthcare and on fucking drugs! Who stays in the way of progress \u2019cause they want to profit off suffering? The people running this country and the ceos are not too fucking stupid to figure this out!!!! Neithr are the board members of med companies. They\u2019re using lobbyists to influence politicians and probably engage in secret bribes and give propaganda v universal healthcare. Affirmative action makes it easier for blacks, hispanic, native americans, pacific islanders to enter, but at the expense of Asians and whites. It\u2019s been here since the 60s. Racism in lending, banks, mortgage companies, hirings and promotions, school loans,& healthcare was ordered to stop in the fucking 60s. Hard to catch racism, it\u2019s subtle. You don\u2019t know why you were rejected and the eeoc is where you fucking report to. Racism isn\u2019t the only factor in why blacks are more likely to do worst than whites. Confirmed Maltreatment Among US Children This is from pediatricians (drs for kids.). JAMA or journal of american medical association pediatrics. Not only is it common and usually life damaging, but more common for blacks v whites. 1/5 confirmed cases for black kids, 1/8 confirmed for all kids, 1/7 Native American kids. Child Abuse: Why People So Often Look the Other Way | Live ... www.livescience.com \u203a 17031-penn-state-child-abuse-e...Nov 15, 2011 - \u201cBy far, most of those cases go unreported. Statistics vary, but studies suggest that only about 12 percent to 30 percent of child sexual abusecases are reported to the authorities. ... Families frequently deny child abuse in their midst too, I\u201d Dandelion children exist which means that they do well despite bad upbringings. 20% of abused kids. Orchid children, too which means they do badly despite loving, supportive parents who have some $. Most are in between. Success is 80% genetic, 20% nurturing. The last 60+ years has seen tremendous progress: school de-segregation, restaurants must serve all races & ethnic groups, no more colored only fountains, no more back of the bus, job & housing discrimination is illegal (Trump was sued 2ce by the Dept of Justice for it), banking discrimination\u2019s illegal, racial harmony promoted by schools, Mr. Rogers, and tv shows, and those that need gov aid recieve it. Nonprofits like the NAACP help a lot. The EEOC responds to complaints about discrimination in the workplace. HEalthcare discrimination\u2019s illegal. Those who need gov aid in the form of EBT (for food), medicaid/medi-cal, schools, get it. Affirmative action helps most minorities get in easier than Asians and whites. Neighborhoods can be cleaned up by people living there save for biohazards. Most minorities get less access to better schools \u2019cause of their living areas & property taxes pay for them. Of course, discrimination still happens. Equal treatment under the law won\u2019t happen for everyone, \u2019cause there\u2019s always gonna be some racists out there and since whites are the obvious majority, they experience less of it. Racist cops could choose to punish some more severely and just be nice to his own race & racist judges could choose to admit racist cop\u2019s testimony or racist\u2019s witness\u2019s ",

            "answer_text": "Pumping billions of dollars into the hands of people who will spend it in the US would probably, in fact, boost the economy. (The real question isn\u2019t the payments, it\u2019s how you get the money *for* the payments. The payments themselves would serve as an economid stimulus, but you have to pay for them somehow.) The evidence is pretty strong that taxes don\u2019t have nearly as much effect on the economy as people think, unless they go to reallllly high levels. That being said, any amount of reparations which weren\u2019t just a nominal payment would require raising a goatload of money. If we gave everyone descended from the slaves 1000 dollars, that would be 40 billion dollars. That\u2019s a small fraction of the federal budget (which is usually about 2\u20133 trillion), but it\u2019s also basically a not very big amount of money. We gave about 20,000 each to the claimants who were survivors of the WWII internment camps and that was for only a few years of bad behavior. Providing the financial equivalent of 40 acres and a mule would be 119,160 in Texas land prices, assuming a 2000 dollar mule. Let\u2019s round to 120,000 for easy math. That is 4,800,000,000,000. That\u2019s 4.8 trillion dollars. That\u2019s about two normal years of federal spending. ",
