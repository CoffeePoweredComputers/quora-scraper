            "answer_text": "TBH I have been observing this question implicitly for the past few days wondering if I could answer it in the best way possible (or perfect way) to no avail but finally here I go (that\u2019s procrastination for you). Now, from what I know there is two possible ways of uninstalling mods and that depends on what mods you are using in the first place. The two ways are: Through the Workshop. If you have already downloaded a mod by going to it\u2019s page within the Workshop and clicking a green button named \u2018Subscribe\u2019. Make sure that you install while the game is open, have the latest update installed prior and then restart to complete install process. Then all you have to do is go back on the same page while the game is closed and click the \u2018Unsubscribe\u2019 button. Voila done! (\u2026most of the time anyway)Without the Workshop. A lot of the good mods for this game (I recommend the After The End and Historical Immersion Project (HIP) mods personally *wink wink nudge nudge*) are not featured within the Workshop as they are either major overhauls or usually larger than what the Workshop allows (I think its 40MB zipped according to the CKII wiki). In this case, most mods are installed and kept within the Documents\\Paradox Interactive\\Crusader Kings II\\mod folder. Simply delete the contents of the mod folder that is linked to the mod of choice (e.g delete Shattered World folder to delete Shattered World etc.).Hopefully I did not lose you there :). Remember, remove kebab before they remove you\u2026.and avoid that hunchback dwarf seducing your character\u2026could mean lover\u2019s pox. ",

            "answer_text": "If you got the game on Steam I am guessing that you have used the Steam Workshop, if so If you simply wish to disable the mod, you should be able to do this at the launcher, above the Play button there is a tab default opened to \u201cDLC\u201d, up top open the \u201cMods\u201d and disable any mods you don\u2019t want.Or if you wish to remove them simply find the mod on the Steam Workshop and \u201cUnsubcribe\u201dIf you are not using Steam and downloaded the file than you must find where you placed said folder/file and remove it from the CK2 directory/region. Thank you for reading and hope this helps! ",
