            "answer_text": "The short version is \u201cseveral months to over a year,\u201d depending on exactly where you\u2019re going and conditions along the way. The monk Xuanzang took about a year on the road to get from Chang\u2019An (modern Xi\u2019an), the Chinese capital and traditional beginning of the Silk Road to India, or rather eastern Afghanistan. A more westerly route, up the Gansu corridor to Dunhuang, across the Tarim Basin, to Kashgar, and across the mountains to Samarkand and the frontiers of the greater Persian cultural sphere is about 2300 miles. At around 11 miles a day\u2014a reasonable rule of thumb for merchant caravan travel rates\u2014that\u2019s around 200 days. However, there are lots of potential delays along the way. For example, travel through mountain passes can be delayed for months by ice and snow in the winter. ",
