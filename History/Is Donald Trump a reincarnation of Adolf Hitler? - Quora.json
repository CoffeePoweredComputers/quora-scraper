            "answer_text": "Comparing Trump to Hitler is absurd. Trump may have fascist tendencies \u2014 and he does \u2014 and he might be a white supremacist \u2014 and he is \u2014 but he\u2019s not a genocidal murderer. I don\u2019t know that it is fair to compare Trump to anyone. For me he is truly sui generis. He is a huckster and a conman with a history of personal and business corruption open to anyone with eyes to see, yet his diehard supporters will never believe that because they don\u2019t want to. He is dangerous because his supporters enabled him at the ballot box. Because they have tuned their minds off to any source of \u201cinformation\u201d that doesn\u2019t confirm for them exactly what they want to hear they can never come to see what they did to the country \u2014 even if Mueller indicts Trump himself. If I were to compare Trump to anyone I think the only obvious choice is P.T. Barnum. Not nearly as nefarious as Hitler or a gangster, but closer to the point \u2014 the archetypical American conman. After all, it was Barnum who reputedly said, \u201cThere is a sucker born every minute, and two to take him.\u201d Whether he did or he didn\u2019t, that\u2019s the Trump administration, boiled down to its essence.

There will always be a superficial similarity between two narcissists, but that in and of itself is not significant. As far as I know, Trump never had anybody killed, and Hitler is by far a better public speaker. ",
