            "answer_text": "No, I don\u2019t think so. I reckon that this question was asked in the wake of those US senators demanding us that we release de Lima from prison, which we won\u2019t. This is merely an issue of sovereignty which isn\u2019t respected by interventionists in Congress, whether Democrat or Republican. Duterte is, in fact, friends with Trump because the latter respects our sovereignty, especially when he supported our war on drugs. Which is why, despite my issues with him, I don\u2019t want Trump to lose the elections next year. Either him or at least Gabbard as POTUS. Because all we want is for America to treat us as equals and not stick her nose into any of our internal affairs. ",

            "answer_text": "That would be up to the Filipino people themselves to decide\u2026 but, speaking as an American citizen\u2026I don\u2019t think that would be very wise for them to do so\u2026 as without the treaty they become vulnerable to Chinese economic and political pressure\u2026 which is not in their long term interests. I have met several people from the Philippines\u2026 they seem very nice people\u2026 and personally I would prefer that our two nations strengthen their relationship\u2026 rather than end it\u2026 as the Filipinos have more in common with Americans than they do with the Chinese\u2026 despite both Chinese and Filipinos being Asian\u2026 culturally the Philippines are far more a western country than is China\u2026 so a mutual alliance between the U.S. and the Philippines makes more sense\u2026 especially as we have no claims to their adjacent waters\u2026 unlike China.
