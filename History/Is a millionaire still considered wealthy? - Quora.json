            "answer_text": "Sure. More wealthy than someone with 100,000 dollars, less wealthy than someone with a billion. It\u2019s the kind of personal wealth that about half of Americans can approach, sometime in their life. Typically, when I did retirement plans, even teachers and firemen were retiring with close to a million dollars, if they were thrifty. The secret is starting your savings early, and putting off dipping into it until retirement, then only taking out 5% or so per year and getting close to that in return after inflation. It\u2019s not hard to do, and I\u2019ve put away 10% of my salary for years, as well as having a good retirement pension. That, and your home equity, will push you over the threshold. ",
