            "answer_text": "Augustus was extremely ruthless, capable, and intelligent. He was a master of PR where he maintained the illusion of the republic when in fact he had absolute power. He was an excellent administrator who ruled so well that when rumors of him retiring spread the people rioted until he personally assured them that he would not step down. Augustus was so skilled as a politician that people today only remember Augustus the princeps, not Augustus the man. Most texts about him parrot the image he wanted to show the people. That\u2019s how good he was. ",
