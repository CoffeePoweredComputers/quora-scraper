            "answer_text": "Yes, both tactically and strategically. The first and most notable post-Genghis Khan defeat of the Mongols was by the Mamlukes of Egypt at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. This defeat effectively halted the western advance of the Mongols. The Mamlukes were led by Sultan Qutuz who had defeated numerous Crusades and one of his commanders was Baybars. Baybars would eventually become Sultan himself, conqueror of the last remnants of the Christian Crusader States, then launch an invasion of the Turkish Sultanate of Rum, which was a Mongol subject kingdom at this time. Baybars is regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of the Middle Ages.  At it's greatest extent the Mongol Empire was the largest Empire in history. The Mongols were also eventually overthrown in China when native Han Chinese revolted against the Mongol Yuan Dynasty and pushed the Mongols back into Mongolia. Most of the time however, the only times the Mongols were defeated was by other Mongols. Virtually every time a Great Khan died it would spark a succession war between the various descendants of Genghis Khan. For a few generations the Great Khans were able to somewhat overcome these crises and keep the empire intact but over time the empire simply fragmented and the Mongols were absorbed into the native populations of the regions they ruled. The Mongol Invasions definitively ended with the 14th century dynasty of Emir Timur, or Tamerlane as he is more commonly known in the West.  Tamerlane came from an Uzbek tribe closely associated with the Mongol Chagatai Khanate of Central Asia. Timur himself was only part Mongol and he couldn't rule the Chagatai Khanate as Khan. Instead, he was more of a \"Power Behind the Throne\" while the Chagatai Khans were figure-head puppets. Timur managed to reconquer about half the old Mongol Empire, stretching from Turkish Anatolia in the West to the borders of China in the East. His heirs, however, were largely incompetent and the empire fragmented again not long after his death.   Uzbek-Mongol Emir Timur, or Tamerlane, the last great Mongol conqueror The very last and final remnant of the Great Mongol Empire actually lived on in India until the 1860s in the Mughal Dynasty, whose founder was a descendant of Tamerlane. The last years of this dynasty were also largely ceremonial as they were figureheads of the British East India Company and the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah died in exile after the failed Indian Mutiny of 1867.  Bahadur Shah the last Mughal, and therefore the last Mongol, Emperor ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, and several times. The first real serious defeat was produced by Mordvin Finns at the Battle of Samara Bend 1227. Lesson learned: Do not attack Finns in the woods. The Khwarazmians under Jalal ad-Din similarly defeated Mongols and even multiple times. Lesson learned: If the enemy general is too good, assassinate him. The Poles under Mieszko the Fat defeated a tumen in the battle of Raciborz 1241. Lesson learned: Knights are actually a tough lot when they get in the close combat. Both the battles of Legnica 1241 and Mohi 1241 appear actually have been real close calls. They could have ended up either way. Lesson learned: it is the generalship which decides, not the troops. Sultan Qutuz defeated Kitbugha at \u2018Ain Jalyut 1260. Lesson learned: The Mongols are not invincible. The Japanese defeated the Mongols on two invasions, 1274 and 1281. Lesson learned: Being an expert on light cavalry warfare does not make you an expert on naval warfare, and always check out the weather report before you go crossing the Tsushima Strait. The Vietnamese defeated the Mongols on three occassions. Lesson learned: Do not fsck with the Vietnamese, they are experts on guerrilla operations. The Poles defeated them in the 1286 invasion, the Hungarians in 1285\u20131286 campaign and finally the Russiana in the Kulikovo 1386. So yes, they were defeated. ",
