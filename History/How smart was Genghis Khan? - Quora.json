            "answer_text": "Here is what we know for certain: There were many Mongol warlords who conquered territory, before, during and after Chinggis Khan's time. Most such efforts disintegrated within the lifetime of the warlord, the rest very soon after.The Mongols trace ancestry to the Huns, although their fighting techniques and philosophies also resemble the northern Scythians. Formidable and feared, spawning many legends, but not nation-builders.Chinggis Khan avoided most of the common errors (religious persecution, xenophobia, etc) of the time and was able to solve most of his military problems through thought rather than brute strength.He was good, for that time, at making use of resources regardless of origin rather than ascribing superiority according to immaterial factors.It's arguable as to how much territory he held precisely because he didn't hold it. He had no objection to other people ruling themselves as long as they paid taxes, recognized a very mild overlordship by the standards of the day and assisted in ventures when asked. He also had no objection to burning them to the ground if they decided to secede (which most did and were).He promoted the Mongols as facilitators, trading ideas, technologies, services and goods between civilizations (and taking a cut) rather than trying to master it all. Because it wasn't mastered, the Mongols retained power by being key to the global economy. Nobody could afford to replace them, even if they wanted to, and everybody was quite happy with nobody else wanting to replace them.However, his vision was as flawed as some aspects of his reputation. Infighting over inheritance was the primary weakness. He had depended on his children being strong warriors but weak leaders. And it showed. On the scale of smarts, Alexander doesn't come close. Most of his reputation came from terror tactics. A jumped-up wannabe who probably poisoned his father for power and probably got murdered himself. He ended up destroying much because he couldn't actually conquer it. Unlike Chinggis, he hadn't the ability to think. Julius Caesar is the first military leader who can be reasonably compared, developing new engineering techniques and obtaining new technologies from others as he expanded the empire. However, his understanding of empire dynamics was flawed and he'd grown the empire to the point where if it didn't expand it would collapse. Which it promptly did. Of the ancient emperor-generals, there really aren't any others of note. Three data points isn't enough to map to the IQ distribution, but it's possible to get an idea. Based on Chinggis Khan's relatively high situational awareness and ability to utilize efficiently, I'll put his IQ at around 120\u2013125 on the current scale and his Avalon Hill rating at 10\u20132.

            "answer_text": " \"I am the flail of God. If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.\" \u2014 Genghis Khan nee Temujin  In much of the material on Genghis Khan, he comes across as a monumental badass, an unremitting portrait of a savage conqueror specializing in genocide. But that is a one dimensional picture of a man born into the hardships of a poor Mongol tribe who rose to conquer an empire that stretched from East China Sea to the Caspian Sea. Genghis Khan (universal ruler) was more than smart. His life (c.1262-c.1227) is an astonishing testimony to a genius who can hold his own against any leader of any time and country. To gauge his genius we must view him as the man who raised the Mongols from an obscure tribe to world mastery. And the manner he did it. What gave Genghis an aura of invincibility among his and other tribes was the divine status that the leading shaman of his tribe bestowed on him. The shaman declared Genghis Khan the representative of Mongke Koko Tengri (the \"Eternal Blue Sky\"), the supreme god of the Mongols. It was accepted that his destiny was to rule the world. Besides his divine status the scarcity of food and resources and a jump in population were incentives for Mongol expansionism. Temujin began his dramatic ascent into history by building a large army of more than 20,000 men. He destroyed traditional divisions among the various tribes and united the Mongols under his rule. In forging Mongol unity he would change the course of history. Even while waging war on the Chinese in the East he began to thrust westwards into the land of Muslim kingdoms. Genghis Khan\u2019s attempts to use diplomacy to establish trade relations with the Khwarizm Dynasty was a disaster. His emissary was beheaded and the head sent back to Khan. The beheading would change the course of events and seal the fate of Khwarizm Dynasty. The act unleashed a fury that would sweep through central Asia and into eastern Europe. In 1219, Genghis Khan personally took control of planning and launching a three-prong attack of 200,000 Mongol soldiers against the Khwarizm Dynasty. The Mongols swept through every city's fortifications with unrelenting savagery. Those who weren't immediately slaughtered were driven in front of the Mongol army, serving as human shields when the Mongols took the next city. No living thing was spared, including small domestic animals and livestock. Skulls of men, women, and children were piled in large, pyramidal mounds. City after city was brought to its knees, and eventually in 1221 the Shah Muhammad and later his son were captured and killed, That ended Khwarizm Dynasty. Quite a few things made the Khan remarkably different from other conquerors. One of his greatest generals was Jebe, a former enemy who shot Genghis in battle with an arrow. Genghis was so impressed he spared Jebe's life. Jebe's nickname became \"The Arrow\".Despite being one of the most powerful rulers in the world, he preferred to live in a tent (yurt).The Khan may have used world\u2019s first courier system by having riders on swift wiry ponies to carry messages quickly throughout the empire. This medieval express, called Yam, consisted of a well-organized series of post houses and way stations strung across the whole of the Empire. By stopping to rest or take on a fresh mount every few miles, official riders could often travel as far as 200 miles a day.The system allowed goods and information to travel with unprecedented speed, but it also acted as the eyes and ears of the Khan. He used the system to keep abreast of military and political developments and maintain contact with his extensive network of spies and scouts. It was similar to the Pony Express that came into existence four centuries later. His four favourite sons were Ogedei, Tolui, Chagatai, and Jochi. Tolui's son was Kublai Khan who would conquer all of China and establish the Yuan Dynasty. He once said that \"conquering the world on horseback is easy; it is dismounting and governing that is hard.\u201d What did he look like?Nobody knows what the Universal Ruler looked like. No contemporary portraits or sculptures of him have survived, and what little information historians do have is often contradictory or unreliable. A 14th century Persian chronicler Rashid al-Din, has claimed Genghis had red hair and green eyes. But Al-Din\u2019s never met the Khan in person. He rarely left a score unsettled.Genghis Khan often gave other kingdoms a chance to peacefully submit to Mongol rule, but he didn\u2019t hesitate to annihilate any society that resisted. The destruction of the Khwarizmid Empire (mentioned earlier) was his most \u2018famous\u2019 act of revenge. But the Khan didn\u2019t stop there. He followed up on his victory by returning east and waging war on the Tanguts of Xi Xia, a group of Mongol subjects who had refused his order to provide troops for his invasion of Khwarizm. After routing the Tangut forces and sacking their capital, the Great Khan ordered the execution of the entire Tangut royal family as punishment for their defiance. He was responsible for the deaths of nearly 40 million people.While it\u2019s impossible to know for sure how many people perished during the Mongol conquests, many historians put the number at somewhere around 40 million. Censuses from the Middle Ages show that the population of China plummeted by tens of millions during the Khan\u2019s lifetime, and scholars estimate that he may have killed a full three-fourths of modern-day Iran\u2019s population during his war with the Khwarezmid Empire. The Mongols\u2019 attacks probably reduced the entire world population by as much as 11%. He was tolerant of different religions.Unlike many empire builders, Genghis Khan embraced the diversity of his newly conquered territories. He remained a shamanist and never converted to Islam or Christianity or Buddhism. But he passed laws declaring religious freedom for all and even granted tax exemptions to places of worship. This tolerance had a political side\u2014the Khan knew that happy subjects were less likely to rebel\u2014but the Mongols also had an exceptionally liberal attitude towards religion. The Steppe peoples were a diverse bunch that included Nestorian Christians, Buddhists, Muslims and other animistic traditions. The Great Khan also had a personal interest in spirituality. He was known to pray in his tent for multiple days before important campaigns, and he often met with different religious leaders to discuss the details of their faiths. In his old age, he even summoned the Taoist leader Qiu Chuji to his camp, and the pair supposedly had long conversations on immortality and philosophy. How did he die and where is he buried?The traditional narrative says he died in 1227 from injuries suffered in a fall from a horse, but other sources list everything from malaria to an arrow wound in the knee. According to one questionable account he was murdered while trying to force himself on a Chinese princess. Whatever the manner of his death the Khan took great pains to keep his final resting place a secret. According to legend, his funeral procession killed everyone they came in contact with during their journey and then repeatedly rode horses over his grave to help conceal it. The tomb is most likely on or around a Mongolian mountain called Burkhan Khaldun, but to this day its precise location is unknown.

During the Yalta Conference it was agreed to make Mongolia a buffer state between the Soviet Union and Nationalist China. Although independent in name it existed as a Soviet puppet. During their occupation the Soviets tried to erase the Khan from Mongolia\u2019s history books. They quit Mongolia in 1989 when Sino-Soviet relations improved. Although they took away parts of Mongolia (Lake Baikal) while leaving, the Soviets could not take away its past. The Russian influence is very much in evidence in Mongolia. But the Mongols remember their legendary hero. When you fly into Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia you disembark at Chinggis Khaan International Airport. The Khan is omnipresent, in the city and elsewhere. You never ever get a chance to forget the mighty Mongol who rode into history on horseback.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Ulaanbaatar - WikipediaSoviet Suppression And The Second Coming Of Genghis KhanGenghis KhanHarold Lamb\u2019s Genghis Khan The Emperor Of All Men Images via Google ",
