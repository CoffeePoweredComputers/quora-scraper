            "answer_text": "The German-trained divisions performed impeccably well during the war. They were trained to the same top standard which the elite Wehrmacht troops were taught at, also the troops were equipped with the latest German weapons. Furthermore some of the German officers personally led and fought alongside their Chinese trainees during the Battle of Shanghai. In the Battle of Shanghai, initially the German-trained divisions pushed back the Japanese marines which meant that Imperial Japanese Navy ships had to launch bombardments to enable the marines to advance further into the city. The German-trained divisions are what enabled the Chinese to hold Shanghai for three long months despite the mass Japanese onslaught. The Japanese had superiority in air power, tanks and they had ships for bombardment too. The battle was always going to be lost however, Chiang Kai-Shek wanted to make a bold stand against the Japanese to gain international sympathy for China and condemnation of the Japanese. What this meant was that Chiang used most of the German-trained divisions in the Battle of Shanghai and as a result he didn\u2019t have that many of them left for the rest of the duration of the war. This is why the National Revolutionary Army (the Kuomintang\u2019s Army) only lasted two weeks against the Imperial Japanese Army during the Battle of Nanjing (China\u2019s capital at the time). The fact that the NRA held Shanghai for three months but Nanjing a mere two weeks was solely because of the German-trained divisions\u2019 input in the Battle of Shanghai. If the Germans had finished training the whole Chinese Army then the NRA would have definitely repulsed the Imperial Japanese in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The fact that the Wehrmacht only finished training a mere 8 out of the original 80 divisions they sought to train yet those eight divisions made a massive difference in the war shows you just how useful they were. Imagine if China had ten times the number of German trained divisions/troops they had access to when the Japanese attacked? That would have made a massive difference. So to answer your question they were highly effective. It is a pity China didn't have many German-trained troops. ",

            "answer_text": "In fact. The German trained army had little effect. Because the number is too small, and there is no backup source. They also lack critical weapons. The really outstanding ones are American trained troops. After equipped with American weapons. The American trained Chinese army, as the main force of the coalition army, swept Southeast asia. From Burma to Vietnam, to singapore. Defeated 7 times the Japanese army. Unfortunately, they were completely wiped out in the battle against the people's Liberation Army in Northeast china. ",
