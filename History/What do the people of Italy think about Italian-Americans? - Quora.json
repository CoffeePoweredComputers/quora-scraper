            "answer_text": "Interesting set of answers I have read so far. Let\u2019s just start by saying that neither \u201cItalian-Americans\u201d nor \u201cItalians\u201d have a monopoly on arrogance, ignorance, or stupidity. I was born in the US, but I spent a large part of my youth in Italy, in the village my parents were born in. Italian was my first language. The \u201cItalian-Americans\u201d I got to know in the US, my dad\u2019s peers, well, they were in fact Italians, born in Italy. We\u2019d sometimes have social clubs dedicated to the immigrants from a particular village in Italy. Sometimes, the less said, the better. They were, for the most part, the Italian equivalent of rednecks. Uneducated peasants that moved to the US in the aftermath of WWII. They did not speak proper Italian, and brought with them some pretty backwards attitudes. They were pretty much all working class. The factory workers and semi-skilled laborers. I can\u2019t help but feel that some of the opinions of Italians expressed in answers to this question are based in class animosity. They would speak their regional dialects to their kids, tell the kids that that was Italian. And these children of immigrants, they would tell their kids that they were Italian. And those first generation Americans would, in turn, if they married another first generation American of Italian descent, would do as their parents and tell their kids they were Italian. Some Italians speak of Americans of Italian descent being ghetto-ized for a time. Did you know that after blacks, Italian-Americans were the most lynched? So, on the one hand, we got told we weren\u2019t really Americans. On the other hand, you want to come and tell us we aren\u2019t really Italians. Yeah, some of my fellow Italian-Americans are ignorant and provincial. They haven\u2019t got a monopoly on that. And I have certainly met their analogues in Italy. My mom went to her village in Italy to take care of some business a few years ago. She had some relatives jumping down her throat about American policies. She can\u2019t even vote in the US, she is a permanent resident, but a citizen of Italy. How\u2019s that for some ignorant arrogance? You don\u2019t get to tell us how we choose to identify. And if you don\u2019t like that, te lo puoi mettere in culo. Now, all that being said, I don\u2019t call myself Italian, or Italian-American. I identify as American. But I\u2019m not about to tell my brother, who is an officer in his local chapter of the Knights of Columbus, and seriously hurts my ears when he tries to speak Italian, that he\u2019s not Italian. Now, before I finish this rant, I find that I recall that both of my brothers were looking into the possibility of getting Italian citizenship. Because, you know, Italian citizenship is by jus sanguinis. Your own laws say that if I wanna be Italian, I can be Italian. Update: Sorry if this comes of as an angry rant. Maybe I have had one too many heated discussions with stupid Italian-in-Italy relatives. ",
