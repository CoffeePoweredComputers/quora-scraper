            "answer_text": " At the time of his death the Sun King Louis XIV was very unpopular. Both the nobles and the common people had slowly started to hate him; endless wars, famine, extreme use of finances. There was actually dancing in the streets of Paris when Louis XIV finally died, his body full of gangrene..  The French showed it by shoving aside his last will and Testament. The bastard sons of the King would not become Regents but his nephew Philippe, Duke of Orleans whom the King had hated. For the Duke was an almost Enlightened quasi-agnost with too much faith in the occult and a sexaddict with an exhibitionist streak. At the time the King\u2019s successor and great-grandson, Louis XV, was only a boy, 5 jears when Louis XIV died...-  Yes, Louis XIV made Versailles but have you any idea how much money it cost! Overkill if you ask me.. And in fact it was only in use around a century. And the atmosphere in Versailles had nothing to do with the real world, Planet Versailles. And it was boring, the same plays, ballets . etc. on this day or that day. And of course there is the Expulsion of the French Protestants, hardworking people, which crippled the French economy.. Louis XIV stands for most of the things the unfortunate King Louis XVI, his Queen and his relatives were executed for. With a good dosis of hypocrisy too! I am sounding like a republican but i am making short shift with would-be conquerors of the world, whether Attila the Hun, Louis XIV or Napoleon I. And after all both French rulers ravaged the country where i live.. Maybe Louis XIV is still popular with some French nationalists but the modern people of France have other interests. After all they now have a Sun President! PS. I do not like Versailles also because of the Declaration of the German bogus Empire and the Treaty of Versailles, both utterances of idiocy! ",

            "answer_text": "As a French citizen, I would consider him one of the dumbest French king in existence. He got involved a lot of useless wars to gain minor territories of little strategic importance.While it wasn\u2019t stupid to domesticate the nobility in Versailles, he seriously abused the sumptuousness of it. Louis XV would show more restraint and exaggerate less.He had the protestants leave France and strenghten all her enemies. Even if they so badly wanted to exclude them, it would have been a better idea to force them to go to the colonies, because protestant were in the previous century very involved in the colonial front on the behalf of France precisely to escape their lack of appreciation in France.The Spanish Succession War succeded to put the Bourbon on the thrones of the realms of Castile-Aragon, but there could not be an union of Crowns, so while it suppressed the Iberic peninsula as a rival, it didn\u2019t make France more powerful. It could have been opportune to accept an Habsburg of Austria instead but coerce them to have all their marriages with the princes of France, so basically to turn the Habsburg strategy against them.The Midi Canal (Royal Canal in Languedoc) in the south was not such a great idea. It never became a canal for international trade to bypass the strait of Gibraltar, since it wasn\u2019t large enough for an oceanic use.",
