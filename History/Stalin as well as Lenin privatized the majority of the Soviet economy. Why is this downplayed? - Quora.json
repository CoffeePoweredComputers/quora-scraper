            "answer_text": "Because it never happened. In the case of Lenin, there was a major privatization of rural, but not industrial, property and the New Economic Policy was based on a partial return to a market economy. The reason was not ideological so much as practical. After the Civil War, the economy was collapsing and peasants needed an incentive to produce. The intention was to allow a certain development to occur before moving towards collectivization at a later date once the economy had developed sufficiently. Stalin however, totally put an axe through the entire NEP when it was still in its infancy and moved directly back to War Communism. The peasants who had made any money under the NEP were targeted as part of Stalin's war on the \u201crich peasants\u201d and forcible collectivization was imposed. Under Stalin, all of the small enterprises that Lenin had permitted to continue functioning were nationalized and the private economy was destroyed. Stalin did not privatize any part of the Soviet economy; on the contrary, he reversed the experiments with rural privatization initiated by Lenin and nationalized small enterprises that Lenin had not yet touched. I don't know where you get the idea that Stalin privatized any part of the Soviet economy. In any case, the long association of communism with central planning is very much a direct result of Stalin redefining the idea along those lines. Stalin effectively rewrote the entire communist program according to his own understanding, an understanding which had no room for even fairly harmless forms of private enterprise. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, Sean Smit. >>Stalin as well as Lenin privatized the majority of the Soviet economy. Why is this downplayed? Criminal group that Stalin and Lenin participated in indeed had privatized equivalent of ~50.000\u2013250.000 of 1912 state-owned USD (~6.2 M USD in 2018) during series of post offices robberies in 1912. These activities were never downplayed, and actually are considered as strong point in Stalin\u2019s CV by current day Russian Federation Communists. As for privatization of \u201cthe majority of the Soviet economy\u201d it\u2019s either topic started uses word \u201cprivatized\u201d in very special meaning, or topic starter was misinformed about Bolsheviks activities in 1917\u20131922.
