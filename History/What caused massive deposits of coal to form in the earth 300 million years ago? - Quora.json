            "answer_text": "Trees invented lignin -- the tough fibrous component in bark -- millions of years before bacteria and fungi invented ways to break down and digest lignin.  (Even today, lignin takes a long time to break down and only a few organisms can digest it, but there are enough that it gets recycled eventually.)  That meant for millions of years, trees that died didn't rot and get recycled as they do today; instead, they just piled up and eventually got buried and became coal.   Along with 50 million years' worth of dead trees there was also a lot of swamp, because of sea level changes.  Swamps are also great ways of accumulating carbon, because the low oxygen and acidic conditions in the bottom of the swamp reduce decomposition. Peat swamps can accumulate about 1 mm of peat per year, which, again, adds up to a lot of carbon over 50,000,000 years. ",

The climate changed due to continental drift and the dead trees were covered with layer upon layer of silt. The weight of this silt eventually compressed the tree remains to the coal we see now.
