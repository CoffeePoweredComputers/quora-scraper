            "answer_text": "No. Persia lost both of the Greco-Persian Wars. It made great advances early on, especially prior to the Ionian revolt. However, the Greek city-states were ultimately successful in repelling the invading Persian forces and forcing them out of the Greek peninsula. You can get a good overview of the conflicts here: Greco-Persian Wars. Keep in mind that winning a battle is not the same thing as winning a war. If it was, then the Confederacy would have won the Civil War in the first two years. The Persians fundamentally misunderstood the Greeks and thought that since they weren't united in an imperial manner, they would easily fall to a divide-and-conquer method and could then be subjugated to Persian-appointed rulers (the tyrants). And, most of the Greek city-states were willing to submit when Darius demanded it after he reconquered Ionia and Thrace. But Athens and Sparta were not about to go quietly and they were able to hold off long enough to prove to the rest of the city-states that Persia could be defeated (Battle of Marathon).  After the first invasion failed, Darius withdrew and began planning another invasion. However, a revolt in Egypt required his attention and he died before he could enact his plans to subjugate and conquer all of Greece. His son Xeres took up the task and tried the diplomatic route first but wisely bypassed asking Athens or Sparta to submit. However, the Greeks now knew that the Persians could be beaten and that they were capable of beating the Persians so several city-states allied themselves with Athens and Sparta. The second invasion didn't fare very well for the Persians because the Greek forces learned quickly and, frankly, out-generaled Xeres and Mardonius. The Greeks were willing to take losses and were more patient and defiant than the Perisans expected. Once they took down the Persian navy at the  Battle of Salamis, they scared Xeres into fleeing back into Persia while Mardonius remained behind to fight the war for him. The next spring, though, the Greeks killed Mardonius at the Battle of Plataea and destroyed the rest of the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale.  With their fortunes reversed, the Greeks had the upper hand over the Persians and forced them out of their territory, eventually taking control of Byzantium and Sestos which gave them control of all the straits between Europe and Asia. The Spartans left the alliance after Byzantium and the Athenians and Aegean city-states formed a new alliance at Delos called the Delian League. The Delian League continued to attack Persia for nearly another thirty years, winning the Battle of Eurymedon and the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus. At this point, Persia really didn't want to fight anymore and eventually peace was established between the Delian League and Persia. -- G.K. ",

            "answer_text": "NO!The Greeks were never defeated in any War by the Persians. No one can rewrite the historical truths of the Wars between the  pan-Hellenic forces defending their homeland (city-states) and the invading barbarians from Persia. The Greeks (pan-Hellenic forces) won their two wars against the Persians. While the Battle of Thermopile was a Persian win it was only one of a number of battles where these two opposing forces saw action against each other. At the end of the second War the Greeks remained victorious - successfully decimating the Persian forces - forcing their hasty retreat with significant loss to their invading armies. The movie 300 is a horrific historical betrayal of the actual battle with its huge number of \"poetic\" presumptions.As for the lack of warriors at Thermopile the best counter to the concept (unreal assumption) of retreat -  as in to give up - is to review the historical records of the times and not just Herodotus. Leonidas held a council of war which led to the decision to split up the Greek force. There was no reason for the entire army to be annihilated in this battle at this time. Most contingents were now allowed to return home and prepare for a later showdown. Leonidas and his Spartans, however, would remain at Thermopylae. Standing by them were the loyal (some 700 or so - disbuted) Thespians, who considered it an honor to die fighting beside the Spartans. Leonidas also kept as hostages some 400 Thebans whom he suspected of having Persian sympathies. They stood the onslaught until there was no Greek warrior alive left to fight. Although some have questioned the wisdom of Leonidas\u2019 decision it is critical to insert the intention of the decision that went to the effect: \"If the entire Greek army had fled, it would have eventually been caught from behind and slaughtered by the faster-moving Persian cavalry. Leonidas was giving the retiring troops the only chance they had to escape and fight another day.\"",
