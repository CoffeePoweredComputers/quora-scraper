            "answer_text": " In our book Italy Invades: How Italians Conquered the World (How Italians Conquered the World) we have a chapter devoted to San Marino. We wrote\u2026 The origins of the tiny Republic of San Marino are traditionally said to be linked to the arrival, in the late Roman period, of Saint Marinus from the island of Rab (in modern Croatia). Situated in the Apennine Mountains near Rimini, San Marino is now entirely surrounded by the Italian state. It has had its own written constitution since the sixteenth century, and it has had a long history of neutrality. Its castles are defended, to this day, by a corps of crossbowmen. You might be tempted to ask, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t it been invaded and conquered by Italy?\u201d  Coppa di Cardinale But, of course, it actually has been invaded by Italians. Traces of Etruscan and Roman civilization that predate the arrival of Saint Marinus have been discovered in San Marino. And although invading San Marino may be taboo, Cesare Borgia, no great respecter of taboos, did occupy San Marino with his papal forces in 1503. In the eighteenth century, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni earned fame as a soldier and a gourmet\u2014he loved truffles and inspired the name of a pork salume, Coppa del Cardinale. In October of 1739, Alberoni led papal forces that invaded and occupied San Marino. Pope Clement XII quickly ordered a withdrawal and restored San Marino\u2019s independence. And Napoleon recognized San Marino\u2019s independent status in the Treaty of Tolentino, signed in 1797. San Marino\u2019s unique position inside Italy has allowed it to become a haven for political refugees. Garibaldi himself sought and found refuge from Austrian forces in 1849 during the Risorgimento, when he retreated into Sammarinese territory. After Italian unification in 1861, he gratefully provided important support for San Marino\u2019s continued independence. During World War II, San Marino provided a safe haven for many political refugees, with its population swelling from 10,000 to 100,000 during those years. Many Jews were thereby saved from the Holocaust. During the later stages of that war, San Marino was invaded by German and Allied forces. Today, Italian defense forces act on behalf of the Republic of San Marino. And if would-be attackers got past the Italians, they\u2019d have those crossbowmen to worry about! On May 8, 2010, Italian Army vehicles mistakenly invaded the Republic of San Marino, which immediately protested to the Italian Embassy. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the Italians under Cavour wanted to portray their unification as both popular and law-abiding. San Marino, established in 301 AD, claims to be the oldest continuously-existing independent nation in the world, and the oldest functioning democracy. Taking it over would have made the new Kingdom of Italy look bad, and they desperately needed to make themselves look good as they dealt the problem of the Papal States and the Pope. When the (elected) Regent Captains of San Marino indicated that they did not want to join the new nation, they were supported by the nation\u2019s Grand and General Council, a meeting of all the voters of the republic. Cavour decided that it was not worth the trouble and bad publicity that would result in taking over the Most Serene Republic, and left it alone. Further, the Sammarinese had offered refuge to a number of pro-republicans who had fled from the precursor states, and Garibaldi had guaranteed the independence of the nation. ",
