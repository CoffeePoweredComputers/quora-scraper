            "answer_text": "Depending on the era and where, there would be systems of ensuring troops are given enough to eat. Part of it involves politics, where locals are given (officially or in reality) protection if they contributed to an advancing army\u2019s provisions. Indeed establishing such forward positions are a common strategy for larger empires, and which they ensured border tributaries are kept loyal by being a bit lax in certain political controls- you don\u2019t want an agitated client state willing to turn on you behind your back as you\u2019re trying to fight another enemy. Some empires rely on appeasement and others more on fear. Establishing storage sites for food was the most common method, it\u2019s hard to gather food if i\u2019s all scattered in small portions throughout a region, so towns can often be a focus of grain storage. Capturing of such food sites was thus of great important: the battle of Cannae, famous for it\u2019s scale and involving Hannibal, was fought because Cannae itself was a site for storing food, and seizing such a sight close to winter meant his army can remain sustained over the winter, certainly not something the Romans were willing to wait out. More sophisticated armies like the Romans as they started expanding overseas, made sure certain ports and cities were the gathering point of necessary resources, the biggest being food. The network of such sites, plus control of breadbasket regions like Africa and Egypt, allowed predictable surplus of food to be concentrated in places where giving them out to garrisons and expeditions can be calculated effectively. During the Romans\u2019 rule, Egypt was so important for food that Augustus ensured it was his personal property, and not merely that of the Roman empire- its management was not administered by the senate, and thus he had great control over the military to ensure loyalty and prevent a coup. And of course having actually developed agricultural technology to produce so much food in the first place is what made such empires and armies possible. Alexander and the Mongol rulers of Genghis Khans empire conquered areas that already had established logistical networks, and utilized them for their regions campaigns- in the case of the former, Persian cities most often capitulated rather than resist, due to their loose ties to the Persian empire and Alexander\u2019s reputation of accomodating surrender rather than a brutal butcher. The Mongols did the same, especially after sacking Baghdad and convincing other cities to put up no resistance. Armies on the march may also have wagon trains that, besides carrying food, may consist of important noncombatants like blacksmiths and engineers; in some cases these even include soldiers\u2019 families or illegal dependents. In such cases, accounts of so many men as part of a horde may be misleading because they might include such people in their figures. And of course simply taking food from wherever you were was a common practice, especially if logistics was not as well developed. Invading armies may not have yet established a forward position to provide supplies and as such the men may take to hunting, foraging, or pillaging locals for food. ",

            "answer_text": "They were fed with food! Well in all seriousness, there were some pretty sophisticated logistics certain places. The Europeans were actually really bad at logistics for a long time. Armies were often fed by looting and foraging, which severely limited the size and scope of armies. However, if you look at the Chinese or Mongols, they had very sophisticated networks of supply. This allowed the Chinese from a pretty early age to field very large armies by European standards. Later the Japanese also fielded very large armies even in their civil wars. The Mongols were able to supply their army of 30,000 from half way across the world. So it really depends on when and where you are talking. Logistics is a science, that Europeans were just kinda late on catching up on. ",
