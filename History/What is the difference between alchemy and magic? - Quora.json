            "answer_text": "alchemy is the study of breaking down, and rebuilding something. so lets say if you broke a glass, you can fix it use a transmutation circle and making it the same before it broke or you could make it something else but it would have to be the same. magic\u2026 thats a bit harder to explain, because it has so many different ways of using it. because theres life magic, death magic, fire, water, earth, air, light, dark, and so so so much more. but it;s used to heal people, and or destroy them through battle magic. the big differences are that Alchemy is something that we can explain, magic goes much deeper then that.

            "answer_text": "Alchemy is the creation of thoughts through our mind that executes into Reality. An alchemist takes something ordinary and transforms them into something extraordinary. It is the deepest form of philosophy. Magic is something that is already in sync with the Universe. It depends on an individual who really sees and feels it. It is gifted to everyone but only a few realizes the mystics of it. ",
