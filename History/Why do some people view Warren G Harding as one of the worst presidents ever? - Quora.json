            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think Warren G. Harding is at the bottom of the barrel. But he\u2019s definitely far from even the center of the list. He might be the worst president of the 20th century. It\u2019s important to note that Harding himself was, for the most part, not corrupt (as far as we know). Harding\u2019s accomplishments are often forgotten as well. His administration oversaw the first unified budget, landmark anti-lynching laws, and a growing economy. However, the booming economy was due to his free market policies. In other words, he allowed the economy to boom by doing as little as possible. Harding\u2019s administration was extremely corrupt, the prime example being the Teapot Dome Scandal. His death was sudden, and some say his wife killed him as retribution for his numerous affairs (just a story). In other words, Harding\u2019s presidency was inconsequential. He is viewed as a weak leader who was more focused on parties than politics and appointed corrupt friends to administrative positions. Was he a good president? No. Was he the worst? No. ",

A womanizer, he fathered a child in a White House closet. The Teapot Dome scandal happened during his administration but was revealed after his death.

Harding. Teapot Dome scandal - Wikipedia . DNA proves President Harding fathered child out of wedlock . . Albert B. Fall - Wikipedia ",
