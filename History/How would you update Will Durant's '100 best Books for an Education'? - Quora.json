And then I found that the list has already been \u2018modernized\u2019. The new and improved one is here: One Hundred Best Books I wouldn\u2019t treat it as \u2018gospel\u2019 but some great additions have been made. ",

I\u2019d break it down by American (Twain, Fitzgerald with subspecialties like the Beats and Harlem Renaissance), British Lit (Dickens, Wells and maybe some Victorian), Continental European (lots of options here), I\u2019d separate out Russian (which has tons of options), Latino/Caribbean, some Asian/African and then key nonfiction books, like Darwin, Marx\u2026 Maybe throw in some key science fiction or another genre; maybe \u201cThe Maltese Falcon.\u201d The sky\u2019s the limit.
