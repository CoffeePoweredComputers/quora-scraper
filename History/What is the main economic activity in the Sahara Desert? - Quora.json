            "answer_text": "It'svery difficult to implement any economic in desert, especially in the biggest one in the world. When Sahara desert was colonial, the authorities had no internet in making use of this desolate region. Nevertheless, things changed after the Second World War. Because of the exploration of oil, which attracted considerably international investment. Besides, people living in Sahara desert also tried to exploit mines. Though they got nothing from it but caused environmental deterioration. Later, people got some metallic mineral by right of more advanced tech. Metal minerals are economically important. Algeria has several large iron mines, and the storage of Mount Ijill in the western part of Mauritania is considerable; the reserves of Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Western Sahara and Niger are slightly less. A considerable amount of copper ore is buried near Akjoujt in southwestern Mauritania, and a large amount of manganese is present in the south of Bechar, Algeria. Uranium is widely distributed in the Sahara Desert, especially Niger is extremely important. Morocco and Western Sahara Desert have very rich phosphate. Desert traditional products (such as skins and wool, excess fruit, salt) only dates, especially the northern oasis of the dates, can still maintain its important position in trade. Although the salt is still being refined and sent to the southern Sudan western region, whichhave to compete with cheap imported salt right now. Since 1950, the tourism industry has developed considerably, but because of the difficulties of transport and accommodation, it can only be limited to the edge of the Sahara desert. France first founded the Pan-Sahara Desert Bus Service, which is still running. It can be regarded as the only service industry about transportation. Anyway Sahara Desert is really a bad place to doing economic activities. ",
