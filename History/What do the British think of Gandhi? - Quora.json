            "answer_text": "Almost all those who have answered so far seem to have misread the question. It asks what the British think of Gandhi today, not what they believe the British Empire\u2019s rulers thought of him 60 -100 years ago. I wasn\u2019t around back then so I can only tell you what I have seen and heard in my lifetime: that Gandhi was a great man, still honored across the world, not least in my country. I was a teenager in 1982 when Sir Richard Attenborough\u2019s film Gandhi was released to great acclaim. The film was critical of the Empire but members of the British Academy of Film and Television awarded it eleven BAFTAs, including Best Film; British critics raved about it, and UK audiences went to see the film in their droves. I remember there being many retrospectives of Gandhi\u2019s life on TV and in the press at that time, none of them negative about the man or his achievements. His image has only become more positive over the decades. He\u2019s up there in our list of greatest ever human beings with Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln. In 2015 the British government honored Gandhi with a permanent statue, erected in the shadow of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament.  The prime minister of the day, David Cameron, was joined at the unveiling by India\u2019s finance minister and Gandhi\u2019s grandson. Cameron called Gandhi \u201cone of the most towering figures [in political history]\u201d, adding \u201cBy putting Gandhi in this famous square we are giving him an eternal home in our country. This statue celebrates the incredibly special friendship between the world\u2019s oldest democracy and its largest, as well as the universal power of Gandhi\u2019s message.\u201d That\u2019s how the British see the Mahatma today.

            "answer_text": "If you are taking about British officials in India then:They must be having immense respect for that man. Nevertheless, they would not have allowed that respect as an obstacle to perform their duty (which was at that time protect their empire).They must be feeling sometime ashamed about what their duty supposed them to do towards that man and their followersHowever at the time of violence and unrest etc., this man would have been surely their best bat to keep the order.A great friend and at the same time the greatest foe to the empire. British official / politicians in UK:As a man who time and again proves to the world that British claim of democracy, liberty and other moral high grounds is actually a hipocracy. He must be big headache to them. General public:Avg good English man would surely be sympathising with his demand and claim. They may also think that this man is good but his demand are unreasonable (giving independence to India is unreasonable, India will be unnatural nation etc.) I AM OPEN TO POSITIVE SUGGESTIONS. ",
