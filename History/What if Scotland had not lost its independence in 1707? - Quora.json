            "answer_text": "Scotland did not lose her independence in 1707. The Union of Parliaments occurred in 1707. Scotland is an independent country within the UK. The SNP show extreme ignorance when they talk about \u201cregaining independence\u201d. The language they use is emotive and inflammatory. Most Scots are patriotic, proud to be Scottish and also proud to be British. Scotland is an independent country today and has been an independent nation within the United Kingdom since it was formed. 1707 was when the parliaments of Scotland and England were united. England is also an independent country within the UK. Vast numbers of Scots had to leave in the aftermath of Culloden in 1746. These Scots went to the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Many other Scots went to far flung places in the British Empire and carved out new lives for themselves. Scotland and England are the two kingdoms which form the UK (Edited because of complaints!). If there had been an English heir after Elizabeth Tudor died, history would be very different. As it was, James VI of Scotland was the heir to the English Crown and became King in 1603. James\u2019 mother Mary Queen of Scots was Elizabeth Tudor\u2019s cousin as Mary\u2019s grandmother was Margaret Tudor, Henry VIII\u2019s sister. James designed the Union Flag and styled himself as James I of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Everything in the UK was spoiled by Oliver Cromwell and the Civil Wars. The restoration of the Stuart Monarchy was short lived and when James II came to the throne the English would not countenance a Roman Catholic as their King. Scotland and Ireland were happy enough with James II as ruler but the English invited Protestant William of Orange and Mary to come from The Netherlands and rule together. Mary was James II\u2019s daughter who had married her cousin William, and both were entitled to the crown. The wars that followed were terrible especially in Ireland. (Orange Order supporting Protestant William). James II had to live out his life in exile in Paris as a guest of Louis XIV. If there had been no Union of the Crowns in 1603 or Union of Parliaments in 1707, Scotland had alliances with France so maybe there are interesting paths to go down there. Scotland also had strong links with the Scandinavian countries and traded with all Northern European nations. Scotland was also part of the Hanseatic League. As to the language, I think there would have been Gaelic in the West, Norse in the North and North East and Lowland Scots (very akin to Old English) in the South. The two Jacobite Risings in 1715 and 1745 caused vast numbers of the Scottish population to leave and go to America and Canada. The Highlands suffered very badly as people were cleared off the land. This wasn\u2019t a war with England, it was the Stuart Dynasty trying to regain the throne from the Hanoverians (distant cousins) and the UK Parliament supported the Hanoverians. George I was the son of Sofia of the Palatinate who was a Stuart and George was very importantly a Protestant. During the aftermath of Culloden and the Clearances the Clan system in the Highlands was destroyed. What if? That was in the original question. There are so many variables and we can\u2019t possibly predict anything in life. What if Cromwell had never lived? What if Prince Henry (James I eldest) had not died early? ",

            "answer_text": "Scotland lost its independence in 1707, as the question states. Any idea that Scotland is now \u201can independent country within the UK\u201d as one answerer has stated, is quite ridiculous. What if? If wishes were fishes, we\u2019d all swim in riches. To be honest, it is difficult to see political scenarios in which Scotland did not lose its political independence, as it did in the version of history that actually happened. The English state had been trying to conquer Scotland for a thousand years until it finally managed, and if not in 1707, then it could well have been successful at some other time. After all, Scotland had already been conquered and occupied by England in the periods 1296\u20131328, and 1651\u20131659, and again in 1746 after the failure of that Jacobite war which had promised the restoration of the Scottish Parliament. Perhaps \u2026 if Scotland\u2019s alliance with France had not been undermined by generations of war, murder and dirty tricks backed by Protestant religious bigotry, perhaps if somehow the campaign of assassination and kidnap to bring about the regal union had failed, then perhaps a benign French sponsorship of Scotland\u2019s independent status would have permitted an independent Scotland of sorts to survive into the modern age. But we are stuck with the history that did happen, and just as Lithuania was fated to be situated next door to Russia, or Austria next to Germany, or Catalonia next to Castile, Scotland also was fated to be situated next door to a much more powerful neighbour, England. But that doesn\u2019t have to be how things are done now in modern times. Scotland can and should be an independent country again, and reconnect with its former European trading partners, and (hopefully) be secure in the knowledge that this time, its independence will not be undermined by dirty tricks or military invasion from its south.
