            "answer_text": "This was during a hot summer in the SF Bay Area, so when a girlfriend Annaliese invited me to Santa Cruz for the day I was all in. I'd been bouncing around a little housing-wise, like 19 year old wild women are bound to do, so I threw on a pair of cutoffs and a bikini top and away we went. I didn't even put on shoes, but I remembered the beer; it was Miller in the bottle for me. Annaliese was about ten years older than me, and I'd known her for years. We met in Germany, when she married an American Army sergeant whom she grew to loathe almost immediately. They had a couple of kids, they fought, they did terrible things to one another but the worst thing she did to Tom was hate him. The worst thing he did to her was try to put Valium in her coffee when she was particularly unhappy. I don't recall now how she came to move from Germany to my neck of the woods, but I do remember her being completely man crazy once she got here. It didn't bother me that she used me to draw the men in, I liked flirting. I was in love with a fun and sexy New Yorker named Randy but it was not exclusive, and in the first couple of hours on the boardwalk Annaliese and I engaged with about half a dozen guys. By 3 pm, she vanished with one of those guys and never reappeared. There I was, stuck an hour from home, not one thin dime in my pocket, no shoes, no shirt, no car - and out of beer. I did what any crazy chick would do during that time, I got out into the line of cars crawling away from the beach and started hitchhiking north. Pretty much the first car by me stopped. The guy seemed alright, I mean, kind of old and kind of cowboy, but I got in. He was one of those \"Well hello there, pretty lady!\" guys, but it was a ride and as we drove along, slowed by the traffic, I warmed up to him slightly. Talking through his thick red mustache he told me he was Jim Valentine, he was 30, and he had a ten year old son. He lived in San Jose, a genius electrician working for the phone company. He was a really good guy, he said, but his ex-wives were ogres. He didn't smoke pot, no, but he could get some by his house. None of that triggered any alarms in my very buzzed head, so I was all for going to his house. Jim lived in a quite nice mobile home, in a quite nice mobile park. Two bedrooms with bath at opposite ends of the house, kitchen and open living room in the center. He had custody of his kid sometimes, but otherwise was living alone. The place was tidy and comfortable. The weed never materialized but the booze did and soon he was far too drunk to drive me anywhere. Jim spent those first couple of days wooing me with his \"gee, I'm just a good and loving guy who can offer you much\" spiel. I wasn't buying, not only because of my boyfriend Randy but also because I just wasn't feeling it. All the while he was assuring me that he had nothing but honorable intentions; would I like to move in for free? Not even pausing for an answer, he waited on me hand and foot, bringing back gifts of flowers and chocolates and trinkets from every run to the liquor store. No, heavens no, he wasn't trying to get into my pants! He didn't even have sex right then, not after his last divorce, no! He wanted me to have the second bedroom, wasn't trying to move me into his. I'd be doing him a favor, because he was hosting his son for a couple of weeks and needed someone to be with the boy while he worked. I felt like a feral cat, staying far enough away to avoid being touched but close enough to be fed. On the third day his son was dropped off. I'll call him Junior, but that wasn't his name. I am changing it to protect him, as the only innocent person in this whole story. Junior was a nice and timid little boy, small for his age and pale with freckles and anxious watery green eyes. His daddy was brutal to him. I mean, if that kid exhaled he did it wrong, according to his father. It only took me these few days to realize that Jim was an extremely mean drunk; something Junior had known for all his tender life. No, I didn't report this to any social service agency, because that just didn't happen then. I'd grown up under the belt, never knew any other way, and my heart went out to the child. I did what any other woman who could do would do: I stayed. Junior and I spent our days just messing around, having a fun and easy time. There was a levy nearby which forced big winds up its side, and we found a way to fly kites off the ends of fishing rods, sitting there on the levy. We spent time at the community pool, drew race cars and tigers, told one another jokes and made dinners together. A week went by quickly, then two. When Jim returned from work each day, the first hour was decent, but from there it was all nightmare until he left for work the following morning. Junior and I used to press together on one side of the table while Jim got drunker and meaner, going off on wild tears about really anything. There were a few common themes to his tirades; the one relevant to this story was about his best friend Bill. Here's what I knew about Bill: Bill was a really great guy, Jim always said. Bill was smart, Bill was handsome, Bill was a pilot. Bill had so many women he needed an abacus to count them practically. Bill was in London right then, but Jim could not wait to introduce us when he returned. Bill this, Bill that, Bill, Bill Bill! Somehow, though, before the tales of bromance ended, they'd turn dark. A switch was flipped in Jim every time, but exactly because Jim was such a mean drunk this had no particular impact on me. When it was Junior's time to go back to his mom, I took the opportunity to leave as well. Jim's promise to leave me alone, in that way, had eroded although he was too drunk to do much about it, and I had to go. Jim was unhappy but said he'd get me home that weekend. Four more days. During these four days, Jim was on best behavior. He didn't drink, he took me out, he bought me nice clothes. He told me how sorry he was, said the booze had gotten the better of him, swore up and down that he would not hit on me again. I wanted to believe him, and I didn't really have anywhere else to be, but I stood my ground. The day I was to leave, Jim came back from running errands with a big surprise for me. No, this time it wasn't flowers or candy, teddy bears or clothes or even pot. It was a gorgeous, perfect, cherry 1963 Dodge Dart convertible, cream colored with red interior. Stab and steer, slant six, not a mark on it, and it was for me. I hardly knew how to feel. It was nice, yes, but how to respond? I felt highly conflicted, until I drove it to see Randy that night and he was crazy about the thing. That clinched it, I was keeping it, and realized that also meant I'd be staying a while longer. Once I agreed to stay and accepted the keys, Jim started drinking and being part jack-ass, part psychopath again. When he got like that, I'd jump in the Dart, bound for Randy, until Jim started taking my distributor wire. One day when he was at work I realized he'd forgotten to take the cap that day, so I ran away with the car to Oakland, to see my sister. It was only a matter of hours before the cops came, saying I'd been reported as having stolen the car. They told me to take it back, and I realized that as long as I had that car I'd never be free of Jim so I complied. I was frightened, too, because I didn't know how Jim had figured out where to find me. Later, he said that because he worked for the phone company he could find anyone's number and address. This proved to be true. That night, when I was returning the car, best friend Bill finally made an appearance. Prior to Bill's arrival, Jim was as nervous as bowl of Jell-O; did he look alright? Was there enough booze, should he go buy cheese and crackers to go with the rib eyes he bought? It was embarrassing. Bill was indeed a good looking man, not in a Brad Pitt way but in a George Clooney way. He had very dark hair, and I want to say blue eyes but I don't really remember. Maybe he was wearing a flight jacket, or maybe that's something I made up because my pilot dad always wore one. I know that he had a very easy way about him, had style and tact and manners. Even I could see this was a mismatch. I don't remember what we talked about, or if we ate, or really much more than that. A couple of hours in to the visit, I went to my room and went to bed. When I woke, the sun was just coming up. What was going on, why did my face hurt? Who was yelling? Dimly at first, then fully, I realized Jim was sitting across my body, hitting me, demanding that I get up and fix him something to eat. OK, sure thing, no problem, I was only too happy to do whatever this lunatic wanted me to do. Walking in to the kitchen, I saw blood. Lots of blood. First, I was aware of a thick congealed pool of it, as big as a steakhouse dinner plate and twice as high. I was trying to make sense of it, and all I could figure was that Jim got out of hand so Bill hit him over the head and left. Over getting some spaghetti going, I assessed Jim, but the only injury he had was a half-inch gash on his elbow. Scanning the kitchen, I saw there was also blood splattered up on the back-splash as well as a on the ceiling. I saw two or three more piles of the blood goop, smaller than the first but sizable. Bill was nowhere. Stay cool, I thought, keep your head. He will pass out soon and then you can run away. I acted as if I didn't see any of it, made the food, and served it. As drunk as Jim was, he could see what I was thinking, so once he wanted to lay down he forced me to lay with him, in my bed, and listen to his rant. Mostly, he was on about a date he'd gone on the week before, how he'd really not gone, how he'd spied on me instead. He figured I would invite Randy over, and he was right. Jim had seen us doing what lovers do, all over the house, and his ability to describe certain scenes let me know he was telling the truth. I wasn't sure if he was calling me a slut or asking me for some, and I didn't care. Jim did not pass out until 2 pm and as soon as he did, I made a beeline for the door and the Dart. Hell with the cops, I was using that car for transportation! Do you think it started? No, of course it didn't, because Jim had taken the distributor wire again. I was really scared, did not want to walk back in to that house, but I had to. I had to go back in and toss Jim's room for the missing car part. I'd not spent any time in Jim's room before, and although it was day the place was hushed and dark. My body was shaking, my head a hornet's nest, and I had trouble putting one foot in front of the next. A single shaft of light came across the foyer to his room, dividing the area in half. Each half stood an equal chance of hiding a bloody body or an ax-wielding murderer but I had to keep going. I walked over to a low dresser and opened the top drawer, but that's as far as I got. What I saw in the drawer took my fear and fed it spinach; now I was terrified. I'd never seen any adult toys before, and have never seen anything like this collection since. I'm not going to describe what I saw but these were abnormal. Most seemed to be geared toward inserting in women, or men, or what did I know? There were also some items designed to subdue and hurt. I could not imagine, but what I couldn't imagine was made plain when I found his stack of souvenir Polaroids. I flew out of there, jet style. I never saw Jim, Anneliese, Bill, Junior, or the Dart again. I did speak with Jim once more though. After I escaped, I answered an ad to rent an apartment with a complete stranger, in a town 60 miles from Jim. There was no connection at all to anything or anyone Jim had ever even heard me talking about, none of the utilities were in my name, and I was sure he wouldn't be able to find me. Wrong. A month later, I answered the phone and it was Jim. My heart almost squeezed out of my ears. I think I just listened, don\u2019t recall saying a word. What he was calling to say was that he knew I had stolen his two Winchester revolvers, and he was coming for them. Later, I wondered if he said this because he used them to murder Bill, and was trying to make it look like I did it. I'd not known he even had guns. When Jim told me he would get to me, that I would never know where or when, it didn't even seem clich\u00e9. I believed him. I ran again, this time far away. In the ensuing years I have wrestled with going to the cops frequently. Initially, I thought I would not be believed, thought they would never buy that I slept through a murder, would somehow twist me up in the crime. Anyway, hadn\u2019t I walked around in the blood, made a meal, all pointing to my having a part? Later, I thought I would have nothing real to tell them, heck, I didn't even know what exactly had been committed! I didn't know Bill's last name, couldn't remember what color his eyes were, and really just was afraid. It's something I still wrestle with. I believe I witnessed a murder; what do you think? ",

            "answer_text": "I've been joint first on scene to a couple, one where the victim had not quite died yet. Both were stabbings and both were in leafy North East Cambridgeshire One was a call late at night to a flat above some shops. The offender had ambushed and murdered his girlfriend in their flat, then tried (and failed) to kill himself. When that didn't work he bottled out and called police for help. We got in and it was like a scene from one of those hammy horror films where they use far too much fake blood - it was everywhere. He was sitting cross-legged on the floor with his knife - he could not stand because he had tried to cut open his Femoral Arteries via his inner thighs. She was upstairs under a bedsheet, very dead, I can still picture seeing her head half sawn off. The other was a Lithuanian chap that had been stabbed in the arse by his housemate. Apparently it is major insult to get stabbed in the arse. They had argued over which one was going to pay for the vodka and he lost. It wasn't an intentional murder, but the attacker got it wrong and sliced through his Femoral artery and he bled out in minutes. I arrived just as the ambulance crew were literally sprinting out the front door with the patient. I got a look at his face and could see straight away he was staring into that tunnel of light. As for actually being an eyewitness to the act and the death - no, that is quite rare for anybody. A street fight gone wrong maybe, or a targeted assassination. Often the victim doesn't show signs of imminent death for some time. We had another murder a few years ago: a local drug user had been stabbed by the new boyfriend of his ex-partner (they tried to demonstrate that she had set him up for it but couldn't secure the evidence). When police arrived, the victim was walking around grumpily complaining that he wanted to retrieve his clothes. An ambulance was called and he begrudgingly got in and went off to hospital while the incident initially appeared to be a minor scuffle. We got a call from the hospital a few hours later suggesting we should get there as he was now on life support and not expected to last the night - he didn't - single stab wound to the liver I think. He didn't even have any blood on his shirt when he went off to hospital: all the damage was internal. I've just realised that in writing this, I have painted the Fens area that I work as a knife crazy stabathon zone. It's not - there was a good gap between each of these. ",
