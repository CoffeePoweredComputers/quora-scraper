            "answer_text": "Trump was a reality show host, not a game show host, and he\u2019s rather turned the national discourse into a reality TV show. I agree with Barack Obama, who said: It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset of 'what's in it for me' and 'to heck with everybody else' ... is operationalized in our government. That first part is undoubtedly true, just look at the rest of the world without Donald Trump. But the second part is also true when we consider the US being slow to start testing. Testing is what allowed South Korea to survive the crisis with far lower casualty rates and without having to shut down their society. Testing was South Korea\u2019s great success story, and Trump calls testing \u201coverrated.\u201d I think it would be arrogant for anyone to say with any certainty what the casualty numbers in the US would be today with a different president, say Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden. But that guy who died after drinking aquarium purifier because it said Chloroquine on the label, would still be alive.[1] Footnotes[1] https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/24/coronavirus-chloroquine-poisoning-death/",
