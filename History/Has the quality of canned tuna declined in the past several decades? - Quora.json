            "answer_text": "Canned tuna has undergone a serious deterioration in quality over the past several decades. I would venture that the craze for sushi has driven much of this. When I was a youth, a typical can of tuna would contain a \u201cbullseye\u201d of whole steak surrounded by fragments of meat. Now, even cans labeled \u201cchunk\u201d frequently are little more than mush. The low-end brands are almost a pur\u00e9e and only the very most expensive types have a whole piece of meat. Confirmation of this came recently when I noticed how canned salmon often has better flavor and texture than a lot of regular tuna. ",
