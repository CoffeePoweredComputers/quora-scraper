            "answer_text": "Medieval universities\u2019 main assets were their books. The core business of universities was reading aloud from the universities\u2019 books. The reading was called lecturing and was held in large halls build for this purpose. The students were organised in corporations called nations, one for each ethnicity or for every language. This was very practical as students from different countries or from different parts of a country were not likely to understand each other. The members of a nation were supposed to help each other and the nation was supposed to take a responsibility for each members (the Swedish universities in Uppsala and Lund still require the students to be a member of a nation). The nation was also supposted to organize some sort of education. The main purpose of most universities was to educate priests\u200b for the Catholic church. All education other than the education of priests\u200b was orginally aiming to provide the university with teachers. \u2014/ Why books were expensive /\u2014 Books were expensive. Books were very expensive. This was because paper had not been invented yet in Europe. The ancient Romans had papyrus from the Nile Valley, but papyrus had become rare and by the Muslim conquest of Egypt papyrus was no longer available. Until the introduction of paper Europe had to do with parchment. Parchment was a piece of skin from a calf. A skilled worker could scrape a calf skin almost as thin as a piece of paper. If the parchment maker was not careful enough, he could make a hole in the parchment, and if so you had to go out to slaughter another calf. Calves were not meant to be slaughtered. Cows were valuable and calves were meant to be cows. Male calves were meant to be oxen so they were even more valuable than cows. To make one book, skin from 400 to 500 calves were needed (and as said: no one wanted to slaughter a calf). \u2014/ Few students\u200b could afford a book of his own. Actually: books were so expensive that ordinary students were not allowed to read them. The solution was to have a man reading aloud from a book while the students were listening, without taking notes. This was called lecturing. ",
