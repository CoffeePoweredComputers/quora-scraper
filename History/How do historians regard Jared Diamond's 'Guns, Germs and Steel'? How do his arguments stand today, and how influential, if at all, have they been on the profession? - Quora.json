            "answer_text": "The book is about as influential as a blog post among historians. It's popular among non-specialists and that's it. Diamond is not a historian, and the book absolutely confirms that fact. At his best, he's laughably naive when it comes to the historical method, the process by which all real historians conduct their work. He is, for instance, almost entirely uncritical when it comes to primary sources, and he more or less takes conquest narratives at their word. We know now that the Conquest was neither as simple, nor as decisive, as the original narratives (or even the modern popular understanding) take it to be. He's also guilty of cherrypicking his claims and sources, and gently eliding potential counter-evidence to those claims. For instance, his thesis that human proximity with livestock (and hence livestock cultivation) was the source of most of the killer Exchange diseases and hence the Europeans had a \u201cepidemic headstart\u201d is.. questionable for a number of reasons, but for the sake of brevity we'll leave it at the fact that questions of disease origin are much more complex than Diamond's deliberately simplified analysis. In some cases, cattle is a possible (but not proven) source; in others (like tuberculosis and malaria), it's provably wrong (tuberculosis has been evolving alongside human society long before husbandry; malaria jumped from gorillas). But fundamentally, Guns Germs and Steel is simply not an academic historical work\u2014it\u2019s a pop-anthropology work. Academic works are painstakingly detailed and, ideally, up-to-date on recent findings in the field and conversant with those findings, and Jared Diamond is none of those things. While the book may be popular, assuming it's had an impact on the academic study of history is like suggesting (at the most generous) that a mass market Brian Greene book about physics has made a meaningful contribution in advancing our understanding about quantum physics. Just\u2026 no. ",
