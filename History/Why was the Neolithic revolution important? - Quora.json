            "answer_text": "The transition of many human cultures from a hunting and gathering to pastoral agriculture, animal husbandry and plant husbandry signals the key point where human population explodes - we can support larger communities with more food, share security structures (armies, fortifications, etc).  Humans settle in one spot and focus their energies on particular economic, political, and  religious goals and activities.   The retreat and extinction of big game animals like the mastodon, large birds and paleolithic Bison meant that hunters had to turn to smaller game like deer and boar which required far more interpersonal organization and cooperation...demanding grammar, language and transfer of knowledge. Increasingly humans became dependent on regular harvests of wild grains, berries and nuts (foraging) this creates conditions for deliberate domestication of plants and of seeds. This, in turn, required populations to master astronomy in order to predict when to plant and when to harvest.  This also compelled humans to create new tools for farming and cultivation. Without the neolithic revolution commencing around 8000 BCE we would not have walked on the moon...that is why sites such as Gobekli Tepe and Catalhuyuk are so important.  These sites help us understand this transition period. ",
