            "answer_text": "From what I\u2019ve read women were - until the advent of monotheistic misogynistic religions , looked up to . After all they could produce the miracle of new life , they could nurture and be wise , all the earliest cravings of religious figurines are those of Goddesses , and ancient religions always had all powerful female deities . In ancient Celtic culture women could and would inherit their husbands lands ie Queen Boudicca who lead the Revolt against the Romans in ancient Britain , even Grainne O'Malley in the 16th Century in ( I think) county Mayo or Galway who was known as the pirate Queen , under ancient Brehon law ( celtic law in Ireland) she could inherit the lands of her Father , even above her brothers , but under tudor Elizabethan law she couldn\u2019t so she revolted and eventually a special dispensation was given those lands ( look the story up - a famous old ( jacobite era ) Irish folk song is all about her Grace O'Malley - Wikipedia the song is Oro Se do Beatha Baile  The lyrics are Oh-ro, welcome home Oh-ro, welcome home Oh-ro, welcome home Now that summer's coming! Hail, oh woman, who was so afflicted, It was our ruin that you were in chains, Our fine land in the possession of thieves... While you were sold to the foreigners! Chorus. Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol is coming over the sea, Armed warriors as her guard, They are Gaels, not French nor Spanish... and they will rout the foreigners! Chorus May it please the King of Miracles that we might see, Although we may live but one week after, Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol and a thousand warriors... Dispersing the foreigners! I think woman have always had that strength , but all organised religion to me ( and I speak as a recovering Catholic ) is all about controlling women and their sexuality. There may be few women remembered in History , but despite the misogyny prevalent in their day they are remembered in special way Elizabethan England ( and the special dispensation to the rebel Grainne ( Grace) O\u2019Malley ) Victorian period , in fact a woman, Queen Victoria , defined a whole era , perhaps the founding era of the modern world as we know it. I think men feared woman and the power they had and the unconditional love they inspired through the ability to bring life into the world and nurture children. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, Rosalinda\u2014 This is a recent idea. Women have never been \u201clooked down on.\u201d In fact, virtually all cultures, throughout history, have respected and even deferred to women, but always in accordance with their culture. In savage warrior cultures, rape was common\u2014but only with the enemy\u2019s women, who were not thought of as \u201cwomen\u201d at all, but simply as spoils of war. Same with the men they enslaved, who were not thought of as \u201cmen.\u201d In Islamic society, women can be beaten by their husbands. In some Islamic countries there are \u201creligious police\u201d who carry whips with them, who are allowed\u2014on the spot\u2014to beat any woman who is \u201cimproperly\u201d dressed or escorted or who is driving a car. Under Sharia Law, a woman\u2019s word in court is worth half that of a man. A Muslim man can have four wives, and can take concubines. Yet, ask a Muslim man why he \u201clooks down on women\u201d and he won\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. He will proclaim his reverence for women\u2014and he won\u2019t be lying, His society has rules, and he, together with his reverences, lives within them. People say \u201cin the past, women were property.\u201d In the past, however, owning people as property was normal Some of them wee women. For our young country, this ended with the Civil War. For (most of) the British Empire, a hundred years earlier. Again, in Muslim countries under Sharia Law, slavery continues to be legal to this day. Illegal, but still accepted, female enslavement still goes on all over the world as women and girls, and even boys, are kidnapped, gang-raped, drugged, and sold into brothels. This has nothing to do with \u201crespect\u201d or \u201cdisrespect,\u201d just with the fact that there\u2019s a market for it. Our \u201cofficial feminists,\u201d who want to legalize prostitution, are by extension all for this. This is not inconsistent, because their whole \u201csexual liberation\u201d agenda has to do with becoming (preferably temporarily, because \u201cmarriage is exploitive\u201d) available to the sexual desires of men, and for that matter other women. So, at the same time they protest \u201cI\u2019m not an object,\u201d they try to destroy the only institution that protects them from being one. The NOW even gave an award to Hugh Hefner! and the current feminist idol is Linda Sarsour, an advocate of Sharia Law! So, under different guises, pagan society has always been, and today remains, the same. The only difference is that today we\u2019ve intellectualized it all, thereby having managed to make ourselves confused about it. If you walk into a room where I am, I will stand up. If you sit down, I will hold the chair for you. If we arrive at the same door at the same time, I will open it for you. Why? Because I am a Christian man who adheres to the Judaeo-Christian ethic (the Old Testament Jews were the first to allow women to hold property in their own names) and to me you represent all that is good, poetic and beautiful in the world. This, despite my awareness that you are perfectly capable of opening your own door and that the chairlegs have slip-guards. If you worked for me I would promote you if you earned it and would not if you did not, whatever the national statistics happened to say, and I would pay you accordingly. And if you came to the office looking like a tramp or a banshee, I would treat you he same as I would treat a man who came in looking like a slob or a pimp. I\u2019d tell you to go home and change. This whole \u201csexual politics\u201d business is a giant bag of hot air. We need to stop mawking back at a past we frame in contemporary concepts and terms that didn\u2019t exit at the time, and learn to treat each other with respect, now. ",
