            "answer_text": "...a new expression to which a new idea has given birth ... a deliberate and peaceful sentiment which disposes each citizen to isolate himself from his fellows and to draw apart with his family and friends ... [abandoning] the wider society to itself ... [sapping] the virtues of public life ... [and finally being] absorbed into pure egoism.                                                    --Alexis de Tocqueville on Individualism Democracy in America, Book 2, pt 2, 1840 Individualism in social science is twinned with Holism, or Collectivism, two perspectives for addressing the following question: Should large-scale events be looked at in terms of the participants who enjoy or suffer their effects or as their own macro-level phenomena? The answer, pragmatically, is both, but in fact, the two tend to describe distinct worldviews. While individualism is often assigned to the Western liberal tradition that arose in the Age of Enlightenment, it did not become an identified notion until the early 1800s and the Counter-Enlightenment when it was used in France as a scapegoat for the anarchy and riot of the Reign of Terror. Given such a mongrel pedigree, views of individualism are all over the map. In France, usage (across all political stripes) remains pejorative and relates to social disorder. Germany hewed to romantic versions, myths of the hero warrior or artist or genius. In England, the term has various mundane usages: a reference to non-conformity, a comment on English middle-class self-reliance or, as described in the opening sentence above, to the liberal conception of the individual as the proper locus of moral and political worth. The Japanese view of individualism is perhaps best summed by the aphorism \"The nail that sticks up is first hammered down.\" That tends to hold throughout the East. The US did not directly experience the Counter-Enlightenment that turned Europe against liberalism. And we had a frontier, a mind-bogglingly extensive frontier. That twinned to give an entirely different meaning to individualism here, an understanding later framed by Herbert Hoover running for president in the late 20s as \"rugged individualism.\" De Tocqueville, observing America in the 1830s warned of its possible corrosive effect on our social fabric. But then, he was from the French aristocratic tradition. We never became so wary of individualism. The trappers, miners and cowboys that populated the works of authors from James Fenimore Cooper to Zane Grey were not just idealized but lionized as were real frontiersmen from Kit Carson to Davy Crockett to \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody. My old friend, Marcia Alice Herndon, claimed (just before the first wave of feminism, a holistic concept) that our archetypal women heroes--Annie Oakley, Belle Starr, Calamity Jane and so on--came to be precisely because they lived in overwhelmingly male frontier society and that since males have no ability to socialize females, they could claim their individuality. And so, in the US we largely still view the individual as primary; the individual and his/her rights pre-exist any form of social life. However, I'm not sure that de Tocqueville's extreme take on individualism was ever the threat he perceived, as American individualism is the atomistic version. Just as atoms form molecules, people form enterprises and communities. Individualism, despite the wide-scale introduction here of collectivist perspectives, still animates the American sense of initiative and enterprise. Pair it with \"American Idealism,\" which I define as the notion that all goals are possible, even mutually exclusive ones, and you have perhaps the most right-brained political outlook ever, one that has been a protean and inexhaustible source of creativity here in the US.

            "answer_text": "What is American Individualism? It is the idea that the individual should possess the freedom to define himself as opposed to a government definition of who he is and what he is. It is the freedom to achieve based upon one's own talents, abilities and ambition. It is a contradiction to a collective defining of worth and purpose that accommodates a stagnating philosophy of government oppression. It is the exercise of the inherent right of a reasoning being to reason independently and to shun the encumbering and suffocating tyranny of church and state as both are one and the same. That any attempt be made to squash the individual as a sovereign entity is no less the attempt to destroy humanity and the great potential that it carries. Herded cattle serve but one purpose as the hive has but one purpose, certainly this cannot be humanity and the future of the human race. ",
