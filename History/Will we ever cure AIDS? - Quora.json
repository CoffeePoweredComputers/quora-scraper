            "answer_text": "Maybe. The current state of the research is pretty much this: medical science now has excellent antiretrovirals. These are drugs that prevent the HIV-1 virus from replicating. They do this in a variety of different ways, and patients who are HIV positive take a combination (or 'cocktail') of these drugs. There are enough different drugs available now that this cocktail can be tweaked so if the side effects of a specific drug is intolerable for a particular patient, a different combination can be tried. Pharmaceutical companies are also combining together more and more of these compounds into one pill: while HIV treatment used to require a complex array of drugs being taken at different times during the day on a fairly rigorous schedule, the current range of interventions can now be as simple as one pill, once a day. Side effects of HIV treatment have also massively improved over the last 15 years. There still are side effects from anti-retrovirals, and so patients need to be monitored over time to ensure those side effects don\u2019t occur and are controlled for if they threaten the person\u2019s wider health. The reason to discuss current HIV treatment in this manner is to point out that it currently does a very good job. Not only is treatment much better but testing is much quicker and easier: there are now \"instant\" HIV tests that take less than a minute to tell you with a high degree of confidence whether you are positive or not. The sensitivity of laboratory tests has gotten better. The medical story of HIV and AIDS treatment has been one of huge success. Here's how huge: there are now people who have been diagnosed HIV positive and who take antiretroviral treatment who have an undetectable viral load in their bloodstream. In terms of sexual transmission of HIV, they are actually at a lower risk of transmitting the virus to an HIV negative person than if the HIV negative person had unprotected sex with someone whose HIV status is unknown. The problem is if that a patient stops taking the drug, the dormant virus still lurks and re-emerges. There's research going on into trying to kill off the dormant virus. This could be the potential holy grail of HIV research: a way to give someone an \"all clear\". Less scientifically exciting, but practically important, are approaches to try and reduce HIV transmission. Preventing HIV transmission might be a much cheaper and easier process than reversing HIV and AIDS. Anti-retrovirals have done a good job of ensuring that those who are HIV positive and who get into treatment do not progress to having AIDS. A cure may be a long time coming, but a more aggressive anti-infection campaign would in the medium to long term be equivalent to a cure. Oh, yeah, but humans. Condoms break, sometimes people don't wear them, sometimes people engage in magical thinking about condoms\u2014humans are humans, not rationality robots, even more so when they are having sex. The rise of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) looks like it might be useful here. A daily pill that can be given to at-risk populations that has been shown to have 90% effectiveness at preventing transmission. The way the PrEP trials have worked is that in addition to the daily pill, there is an aggressive testing and treatment programme: to get on to PrEP, you have to agree to go to a clinic and be tested for HIV every three months\u2014if you are positive, you are then channelled onto treatment rapidly. (Which is one of the big problems right now the reason that the virus spreads is because people don't realise they have it. Simply getting at-risk groups to get tested regularly would massively reduce the spread of the disease.) The PrEP trials have been a stunning success so far. Here's where it gets really interesting: the drug used for PrEP in the trials so far\u2014Truvada (which is emtricitabine/tenofovir, a drug combo used as an anti-retroviral for treatment of HIV positive people already)\u2014goes out of patent in 2018. Currently, Truvada as PrEP is expensive. $8,000\u2014$14,000 per year according to one US government statistic I saw recently\u2014another figure I saw was \u00a34,320 (about $6,600) a year according to Britain\u2019s NHS. But when it comes out of patent, then it becomes something that can be made cheaply and routinely given out to anyone who could benefit. For those who are sexually responsible, it means a second layer of protection beyond condoms. For those who aren't currently sexually responsible, it means a primary layer of protection that's actually not far off what condoms provide. (The idea that people are suddenly going to go mad and become sexually irresponsible because of a daily pill doesn't seem to have been borne out by the evidence. It does make a nice moral panic, just like the \"birth control pills gonna turn women into sluts\" meme has for the last fifty or so years.) The number of new HIV infections has been steady for years. PrEP may be an actual way to reverse that if it can be rolled out aggressively. It is currently expensive, but treatment for people who are infected is a lot more expensive. And when Truvada comes out of patent, it suddenly becomes a lot cheaper to use as PrEP both in the West and in Africa. Those opposed to PrEP also talk about the problems of being on drugs \"for life\". Well, those who are HIV positive are on a drug regimen for life. PrEP users are likely to be on PrEP for a few years, a decade or so at most\u2014so long as they are sexually active with multiple partners and thus at risk. If they settle down and engage in either an exclusive monogamous relationship or a strict serosorting type of regime, they can discontinue PrEP. But here's where it gets better: lower infection rate means less people wandering around with the virus. We just need to get to that virtuous cycle where the numbers start dropping, then it\u2019ll hopefully become self-perpetuating\u2014less virus in circulation equals less opportunity to pick it up equals less virus in circulation.

            "answer_text": "See June, 2012 update below-- We've cured it, once, through a specialized stem cell transplant. The patient's name is Timothy Ray Brown, and his case has been documented in the New England Journal of Medicine, Science, Blood, New York Magazine, and other magazines and journals. The type of stem cell transplant that cured him has a high mortality rate because the stem cells come from an outside donor. He was cured by a doctor who intentionally used a stem cell donor who was born immune to AIDS--the case for roughly 1 out of every 1,000 Northern Europeans (they are missing the CCR5 co-receptor--it's a mutation). But the first case of a cure, along with a new activist cure campaign, has catalyzed  research which if successful, would use the patient's own cells instead of an outside donor to cure the patient. There are several other promising research avenues also being pursued by scientists in the US, Europe, and Australia.  City of Hope Medical Center, UCLA, USC, Quest Labs in SF, UCSF, and UNC Chapel Hill are some of the research centers currently pursuing a scalable cure.  Specifically, see Paula Cannon's work at USC and Jay Lalezari's work at Quest. Since the US spends $24 billion internationally every year on its AIDS programs, and AIDS drugs for US patients can top $30K per year, developing and implementing a cure could actually save American tax payers billions of dollars per year.-- This is a pivotal, historic moment in the search for a cure for AIDS. Yet promising research is still bottlenecked--there is not enough research funding, and an often-political process determines which scientific projects are funded.  June, 2012: Sign our new petition for more AIDS cure research funding (http://aidspolicyproject.nationbuilder.com/petition_for_the_nih) . We're the only group with a specific demand. As Frederick Douglass said, \"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\" We strongly encourage private foundations and philanthropists, especially those that already fund medical research, to consider funding *direct AIDS cure* research. Separate funding streams, with separate and independent grant decisionmakers, are imperative so that we can avoid \"group think\" in deciding which research projects merit funding. Let a thousand flowers bloom.  At the risk of seeming self-serving, there is also an urgent need to support cutting edge AIDS activism. My nonprofit organization, the AIDS Policy Project, which launched and is leading the US activist movement for a scalable cure (and has been lauded by top researchers including Gero Huetter, the hematologist who cured the Berlin Patient), suffers from the idea among potential funders that a cure for AIDS is impossible, or that we must be quacks if we are advocating for AIDS cure research, or that someone must already be doing this (they weren't), or that funding will arise and roadblocks will miraculously be removed--no activism needed.   Yet activism has been critical to the pursuit of a cure. An investigation by the AIDS Policy Project revealed that the NIH spends only 3% of its AIDS research funding on direct cure research. The ensuing negative publicity (arranged by us--New York Magazine, etc.) convinced the NIH to add $13 million in new money for AIDS cure research this year that it hadn't intended to spend. We were the only group bold enough to demand more money from the NIH for cure research (we don't take funding from them).  We were also the first group to ever ask them to track their spending on a cure. This new funding is an improvement, but not enough to break the logjam of major and novel research projects that are going unfunded. (And to be fair this is a very difficult economic environment and the NIH has responded to this new campaign for a cure by making it one of their top priorities.) But $13 million is not enough to expedite a cure for AIDS.  So, we are currently seeking private foundations that will fund AIDS cure research. We are also documenting innovative research methods (successful systems for researchers to collaborate that are already used with other diseases, like Multiple Sclerosis) that can expedite the science behind a cure. We are cataloguing uses of technology in arriving at cures for other diseases, such as distributed computing power.  We plan to publicize these and encourage foundations and private philanthropists to learn about them, possibly use one, and to invest in this world-changing research. We also work quietly behind the scenes to untangle bureaucratic red tape for major scientists so that their studies, where possible, are ok'd by the FDA and NIH, enrolled with patients, and start up as soon as possible.  What is at stake for millions of families is whether the cure for AIDS comes in five years or 30. We are a race car. We are pushing--very hard--to make it five. ",
