            "answer_text": "If you mean close order drill (marching in formation like in a parade) its mostly an aspect of training, but also an effective way to coordinate movement of a large group of people. It\u2019s also often used for display (like a parade). Practicing drill can teach both the unit that is marching and the unit leader. The troops learn discipline, how to follow orders and how to move together in a coordinated manner. Unit leaders learn to give effective commands, how to be heard by their troops, and how to get a bunch of troops to move together as a team. While its not effective for a fighting formation anymore, it still has its uses as a learning aid, even if that\u2019s not how people think of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Really? To get from Point A to Point B in a sharp, orderly, slick formation at a steady, comfortable pace. Stateside, most marching is done in basic training and post-basic career specialty training. It instills discipline and teamwork. One wrong step stands out like a single raisin in a bowl of rice. Overseas, in war zones, marching is still transportation once the shooting starts. The contractor pilots and bus drivers don\u2019t go there. So grunts still and always will rely on their trusty LPC\u2019s. Ask a vet. ",
