            "answer_text": "They hated all colored people. Blacks, browns, yellows, et al. Blacks, being darkest, were among the worst on their racial heirarchy. They hated colored people so much that they regarded white slavs as enemies simply because slavs were supposed to have too much colored intermixing. Blacks got comparatively less suffering simply because there were few blacks in europe. Nazis did declare japanese to be \u201chonorary aryans\u201d and \u201casian master race\u201d. But that was only due to political expediency. If nazis had won ww2, and exterminated or subjugated others, they would eventually have turned their claws on the japanese too. Nazis wanted purely white nordic supremacy, and all else were dispensable. Any intermixing of nordics with others was anathema. Preventing all such intermixing was topmost on their mind, and they were intent on eliminating others to eliminate this risk of intermixing. That's all. ",

For example, they banned jazz, calling it \u201cNegro/Jew music\u201d but in much worse language. Luckily there were few black people in the Reich for Nazis to oppress. If they'd gotten any kind of foothold in sub-Saharan Africa, though, the results would have been horrible. ",
