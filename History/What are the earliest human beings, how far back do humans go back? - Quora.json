            "answer_text": "See below: Human evolution began in Africa around 7 million years ago when a now extinct ancestral ape population split and gave rise to the chimpanzee and bonobo family trees, and the hominin or human family tree due to climatic and geological activity pertaining to the formation of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa. Most human species lived in Africa, many of which lived at the same time, and the same places between 7 million and 1 million years ago (give or take). Not all of the African species evolved into Homo sapiens. Some were just evolutionary offshoots that went completely extinct. There were many species that belonged to various genuses such as Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Paranthropus, Kenyanthropus, and our own genus, Homo. Most of the African fossils have been found within and near the Great Rift Valley in countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. But others have also been discovered in countries such as Chad, South Africa, Zambia, and Morocco. In addition to that, the earliest known manufactured stone tools date to around 3.3 million to 3.4 million years ago, and were discovered in the Kanopoi region near Lake Turkana in Kenya. There were also several Out of Africa migrations that occurred. The first was around 1.9 million to 1.8 million years ago with Homo erectus (or the African variant of Homo erectus known as Homo ergaster) migrating into Asia and Europe, where in Europe they evolved into Homo antecessor around 800,000 years ago, and in Asia remained as Homo erectus (or if one subscribes to the proposal that Homo ergaster was a completely different species from erectus, then it was ergaster that evolved into erectus in Asia). The population of Homo erectus/Homo ergaster that stayed behind in Africa evolved into Homo heidelbergensis Homo heidelbergensis migrated out of Africa around 600,000 years ago. This species migrated into Europe, in which that population evolved into the Neanderthals, and in Asia where that population evolved into the Denisovans. The heidelbergensis populations that stayed behind in Africa evolved into our species, Homo sapiens, between 300,000 and 200,000 years ago. Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa between 70,000 to 50,000 years ago, and along the way, interbred with the Neanderthals, the Denisovans, and perhaps with many other as yet unknown human species both outside and within Africa based on DNA evidence. Nearly all of the other human species that Homo sapiens encountered during our species migration around the Earth went extinct around 40,000 to 30,000 years ago (give or take). However, there was yet at least one other species of tiny humans that lived on the Indonesian island of Flores called Homo floresiensis AKA the \u201chobbits\u201d, a species that is thought to have been a descendant of a population of Homo erectus that reached the island around 1 million years ago from mainland Asia, or the descendants of an unknown species of human that might\u2019ve migrated out of Africa even earlier than Homo ergaster did, and possibly existed before Homo ergaster based on morphological traits that the hobbits display that seem reminiscent with hominin species such as Homo habilis, which lived in Africa roughly between 2.1 million and 1.5 million years ago, or even a human species within the genus Australopithecus. Alas, Homo floresiensis went extinct around 12,000 years ago. Making Homo sapiens from that point onwards, after having outcompeted other human species, the only species of human left on Earth, at least for now. But as diverse as the human family tree is/was, it\u2019s just one part of the interconnected on-growing 4 billion year old evolutionary tree of life that it shared/shares/will share with all other past, present, and future species and their respective evolutionary family trees. Furthermore\u2026 Evolutionarily speaking, there never was a \u201cfirst\u201d human (either man or woman) either. In fact, as weird as that sounds, there never was a \u201cfirst\u201d of any species, and never will be. We only use the phrase \u201cthe first (insert whatever organism you want here)\u201d to help us grasp on which recognizable species evolved when based on the different fossils found sporadically throughout geologic time. The reason being is that since evolution is such a fine and gradual process, every individual, of every generation, of every population, of every lineage, of every species, was, is, and will be an ever so imperceptibly slight modified version of whatever it\u2019s parents were, are, or will be. This also means that the current generation can still interbreed with the most recent generation before it and inherent any mutations (either beneficial, detrimental, or neutral depending if those mutations help that next immediate generation survive in that particular environment(s)) from that previous generation. To give a very simplistic example, imagine that there is a super fast and precise camera that took a picture of you every Planck second (currently the smallest measurable unit of time) from the instant of your conception (i.e. the instant when your father\u2019s sperm cell fertilized your mother\u2019s egg cell) to how you look right now. Ignoring the legal definition of when you become an adult, you would not be able to determine the exact moment when you became an adult (you could also use this camera to take pictures of you as an adult in your prime all the way until you gradually age into a senior citizen leading to your eventual death) because these pictures depicting every instant of your life from conception to death would be so finely gradual and continuous that it would be impossible to chronologically go through all of the snapshots and pick out when you were an infant, a toddler, a teenager, an adult, or a senior citizen. Now, using this example, we can expand this to include not just a few individuals or a few individual family trees extending back only a few generations, but many, many, many, individuals, and individual family trees, which in turn would encompass populations, going back thousands, millions, hundreds of millions, or even billions of generations back into the past, or conversely going forward into the far distant future as well. As far as determining when the \u201cfirst\u201d humans evolved, the word \u201chuman\u201d encompasses many upright walking bipedal apes, not just Homo sapiens (which is the only member left on the hominin family tree). This means that \u201chuman\u201d can apply to any species that evolved on the hominin family tree immediately after the split from the now extinct common ape ancestor we shared with chimpanzees and bonobos (and their relatives on their family tree) around 7 million years ago in Africa, right up to as recently as 200,000 to 300,000 years ago when Homo sapiens first evolved on that very same continent. Also\u2026 Racial categorization as we know it (and made up) in this day and age didn\u2019t exist in prehistoric times, and technically still doesn\u2019t today. What we call \u201crace\u201d is just a social construct that is based on the superficial variations displayed in humans, which are only based on extremely tiny genetic differences that are comparable to the superficial differences/variations that we see in the breeds of domesticated dogs, and not necessarily a biological factor that would constitute humans living today as separate species from one another, since humans across all racial/ethnic demographics can easily breed and reproduce with one another, just as all domesticated breeds of dogs can easily breed and reproduce with one another as well. The differences in human skin color are just an evolutionary adaptation to different regions, climates, temperature, and most importantly, the amount of UV (ultraviolet) radiation exposure from the sun. When Homo sapiens (the species of human that we are) migrated out of Africa 70,000 to 50,000 years ago (give or take), they adapted to the climates of other regions over thousands of years and generations through the evolution of skin color, hair texture, and physique, among other physical traits to help them survive. The ones who migrated into cold regions like Europe and Central and Northern Asia and North America evolved lighter skin, while those that migrated into other regions that were similar to that of Africa like Southwestern Asia (the Middle East), Southern Asia, Southeastern Asia, Indonesia, Melanesia, Australia, and South America, remained more or less dark-skinned. Melanin, the pigment in your skin that determines how dark or light your skin is, determines your skin color. Typically, people who live in warm to very hot and tropical regions and climates with very high exposures of UV rays are dark/black/brown-skinned because they have more melanin to help protect themselves from skin damage (especially skin cancer). Whereas people who live in cold regions and climates are lighter skinned or \u201cfair\u201d skinned, or \u201cwhite\u201d because UV exposure is significantly less in those regions and don\u2019t need a large amount of melanin to protect their skin. Earlier hominin species that evolved in Africa and began to evolve exposed hairless or nearly hairless skin in the harsh African sun/heat around 1.5 to 2 million years ago (give or take), along with hominin species who began to migrate out of Africa hundreds of thousands of years, to a couple million years before Homo sapiens would evolve in Africa and do the same, would\u2019ve faced the same selective evolutionary pressures. Then there\u2019s the issue with vitamin D, which is crucial for bone development. In Africa and other regions that are exposed to high levels of UV, humans can afford to be dark-skinned because their skin still lets in just enough ultraviolet B (UVB) to synthesize vitamin D in their bodies (in this day and age however, most people can gain access to vitamin D by eating certain foods and supplements such as fish, milk, eggs and vitamin D supplement pills, and not solely rely on sunlight regardless of where they live). However, in colder places like Europe and Central Asia, sunlight can be hard to come by most of the time, and so this is where lighter skin is better suited in allowing as much UVB into the skin as much as possible, thus making darker skin a liability. Conversely as I had already mentioned in the paragraph above, a person with \u201cwhite\u201d skin living in a place with very high UV exposure can certainly get all of the necessary UVB to make vitamin D, but they also run the risk of getting sun burns and skin cancer if they\u2019re exposed to too much UV rays for long periods of time. Below is a list for all known members of our human family tree over the past 7 million years of human evolution, broken down by genus (the \u201cfirst name\u201d of a species) and species (the \u201clast name\u201d of a species). In the Genus Sahelanthropus: Sahelanthropus tchadensis In the Genus Orrorin: Orrorin tugenensis In the Genus Ardipithecus: Ardipithecus kaddaba Ardipithecus ramidus In the Genus Australopithecus: Australopithecus anamensis Australopithecus afarensis Australopithecus africanus Australopithecus sediba Australopithecus bahrelghazali Australopithecus garhi In the Genus Kenyanthropus: Kenyanthropus platyops In the Genus Paranthropus: Paranthropus boisei Paranthropus robustus Paranthropus aethiopicus In the Genus Homo: Homo habilis Homo naledi Homo rudolfensis Homo ergaster Homo erectus Homo georgicus Homo antecessor Homo heidelbergensis Homo neanderthalensis Homo denisova Homo floresiensis Homo sapiens All of this is known from a massive amount of fossil, genetic, and archaeological evidence.
