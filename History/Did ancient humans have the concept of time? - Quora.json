Certainly our pre-historic ancestors kept track of days, and probably as the other answer notes the general periods of a day. Dawn, noon, dark. They likely could track the seasons. As we move up to later periods, the Neolithic, some groups could track seasons very accurately indeed using wooden or stone \u201cobservatories\u201d. Stonehenge in the UK, \u201cwoodhenges\u201d among Native American groups, etc, etc. The more involved the civilization, the more necessary it became to tell time accurately. Devices like water clocks, hourglasses, and the sundial go back over 2000 years. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know an exact answer, and it also depends on what you perceive as measuring time. Here in Australia, i once lived with an aboriginal community in the APY lands where they maintain many traditions. one is \u2018island time\u2019. basically they would say \u2018tomorrow morning we are making beads, meet in this area in the morning\u201d and by morning they meant anytime from maybe 6am to our 11am ish. just show up in your own time. they don't use 24 hour time, they just have morning, noon and night, measured simply by how the sky looks. so they say meet in the morning, and you just sit there waiting for everyone to show up, for maybe hours.
