            "answer_text": "Were the barbarians \u201cbarbarous?\u201d The \u201cbarbarians\u201d were certainly less economically developed and civilized. That is an indisputable fact. We know this from the archaeological evidence, which shows us that areas like pre-Roman Gaul and Germania were not as urbanized or developed as Roman-inhabited areas. This is primarily because the Romans benefited from the trade connections that flowed through the Mediterranean Sea, linking it to historical bastions of early human civilization like the Near East, Greece, and Egypt. A key feature of classical antiquity was that the dominant form of political organization grew in size. This trend held across much of the world. In the east, the Qin Dynasty and shortly after the Han Dynasty unified all of China under one government for the first time; in Iran, a unified Persian Empire again rose to prominence, first under the Parthian Dynasty and then the Sassanid Dynasty; and in the west, Rome became the first civilization to unify the Mediterranean, encompassing several former civilizations\u2019 territorial centers.  Map of the world in 100 CE Regions like Gaul, Germany, and the Balkans north of the Danube, by contrast, had never had prolonged contact with the limited world of organized civilization before the Romans arrived. Rather than adopting a state-centric model of political organization, they were organized tribally, with loose confederations and alliances periodically forming and breaking up. While empires rose around the Mediterranean and the world, the political forms of tribal people remained small and disunited. However, just because it took centuries for the German tribes to adopt higher-order political organizations that could rival the Romans does not mean that they were necessarily \u201cbarbaric.\u201d What did the Romans really think of the barbarians, and why? The Romans prided themselves on being civilized and cultured. Once, they had been the \u201cbarbarians\u201d in the eyes of more civilized peoples like the Greeks, but they had conquered those peoples now, and while they had assimilated the Greeks politically, the Greeks effectively assimilated the Romans culturally. Roman arts, literature, and poetry, with a decidedly Greek influence, flourished during the late Republic and early Empire periods. This appreciation for high culture, combined with a massive influx of wealth from their conquests, put the Romans in a position to be the snobby cultural imperialists. Along with Greek cultural influences, the new Greco-Roman cultural synthesis combined some Roman elements, such as love of honor, duty, and discipline.  Depiction of Virgil, one of the most famous Roman poets When the Romans looked at the \u201cbarbarians,\u201d they saw the exact opposite of their ideals. It is important to examine words. \u201cBarbarian\u201d stems from a Greek word: barbaros, which was used in a Greek context as a somewhat pejorative and insular term to describe foreigners, those who did not speak Greek or adhere to the Greek cultural standard. The Romans, as with many things, adopted this from Greece and reapplied it to their own context, which was the northern frontier with tribal peoples: the consummate \u201cforeigners.\u201d These tribes valued a sort of warrior ethos that was rather frightening to the more \u201ccivilized\u201d Romans. They practiced headhunting, had a ferocious energy in battle, painted their faces, and yelled fearsome war cries. These were characteristics that the Romans generally saw as barbarous. Compounding this barbaric perception were the atrocities that they would often commit, both on the battlefield against soldiers and in civilian centers against innocents.  Artist\u2019s impression of Gauls on the frontline of battle. The Romans feared the Gauls immensely. The Romans were not incapable of perceiving virtue in the barbarians. They clearly recognized the primal threat that a horde of charging barbarians had, the sheer energy of which had the potential to overwhelm any amount of discipline if directed in the right place. However, the Romans were prideful about their discipline and the ability it gave them to direct things to the right place, and disdainful of those like the barbarians, who were disorganized and undisciplined on the battlefield. In terms of philosophy, they took this idea of discipline and applied it to the lives and natures of the barbarians in general. The Romans prided themselves on their laws and being ruled by laws rather than men and all of that bullshit. The takeaway was that law and submission of a people to laws was the determinant in whether they could be civilized and thus temper their emotions. The Romans were civilized because they submitted to laws that would temper the whims of their emotions, went the logic. The barbarians had no laws, and thus would act on their emotions whenever they saw fit.  Depiction of a Roman court in session Were the Romans actually any better than the barbarians? The Romans were arrogant and believed in their own superiority. However, they were not much better than the barbarians in their own practices. In terms of the end results, the only real difference between the Romans and the \u201cbarbarians\u201d was the order and calculation with which the Romans performed their barbarism. If the Gauls and Germans were brutal, the Romans were several times worse and on a larger scale. These might be high estimates, but Caesar\u2019s conquest of Gaul over the course of several years resulted in the deaths of one million Gauls and the enslavement of another million. That\u2019s a level of genocide that would impress and appall modern observers. Tribal peoples were not lawless, nor were they roaming barbaric nomads. They were settled peoples who used agriculture just as the Romans did and lived in towns and cities, and they had their own laws. The Romans did just as much burning of villages, killing and raping of civilians, and torture of prisoners as the barbarians did. Perhaps worse, the Romans enslaved conquered people en masse, creating a whole economy dependent on forced labor. Tens of millions of people suffered on account of Roman barbarity. Did the Germans recognize Roman barbarity? Yes. Tacitus, a Roman historian who was at times critical of Roman practices in peace and in war, wrote Agricola, an account of the general Agricola\u2019s campaigns to push Roman territory further into Britain. In the book, he inserts a speech from a Briton chief named Galgacus. It is unclear how much of Galgacus\u2019s verbiage was his own and how much is Tacitus using the character of a Roman enemy to project his own disillusionment with Roman practice, but nevertheless, such views were likely common among the \u201cbarbarians,\u201d who had little respect for the arrogance of Rome and a healthy fear of Rome\u2019s own barbaric tendencies. Galgacus refers to Rome as the shores where slavery reigns and puts all of Roman history on trial. The plunderers of the world: they have laid waste the land till there is no more left, and now they scour the sea. If a people are rich they are worth robbing, if poor they are worth enslaving; and not the East and not the West can content their greedy maw. They are the only men in all the world whose lust of conquest makes them find in wealth and in poverty equally tempting baits. To robbery, murder, and outrage they give the lying name of government, and where they make a desert they call it peace.  The Romans burning Carthage. Reportedly, 500,000 people were killed and enslaved from this one siege alone. The entire city was razed to the ground following the conclusion of the siege. Conclusion The Romans were just as barbaric as any barbarian people. In their conquests of much of the civilized world, they killed many and enslaved more still. Despite all of their associations with high culture and philosophy and sensibility, they were not above killing innocent men and raping innocent women, burning villages and razing cities, eradicating peoples and destroying civilizations. The barbarians, though we hear very little of what they thought due to a lack of written sources, saw the Romans as barbarians in a different sense: purveyors of tyranny and pillagers of rich and poor, enemies of freedom and bringers of ruin.

            "answer_text": "Probably. The Celts and Germanic tribes are perhaps perceived as less civilised than they actually were. Neither has written accounts of there achievements and did not build cities, so there is nothing to give an account of what these people thought of the Romans, other than they raised the tribes and resisted Rome\u2019s authority which suggests they were not on good terms. The Celts themselves are not unsophisticated, they did have a basic writing system (Ogham) which is more for short messaging rather than record-keeping, the accumulated knowledge of this society is kept by the druids but by oral tradition (that studied for 20 years), they are not a lawless society. We simply know very little about these early people, it can be inferred that they knew a lot about the natural world, how to improve crop yields, how to keep an accurate calendar, and I think this point is critical, they traded their surplusses! Prof. Sir Barry Cunliffe - 2mins overview of the Druids. Their achievement is in producing agriculture surplus to trade and the society is more flatly based where more generally the Populus prospered than being hierarchical (under Rome which benefitted the elites).  The archaeology would suggest the Celts were good at agriculture and farming, metalsmithing (not sure about the Germanic tribes) and were brave in battle (but not necessarily as disciplined as the Romans, but from what can be inferred undertook tactical military operations to disrupt Roman operations, such as attacking supply lines). For example, a young (possibly nieve) Celtic leader who did rally the tribes should really have not have given ground when Rome landed significant forces, he had the Romans on the run, but let them hold a hill and allowed the Celtic warriors to return to their homes to send replacements (a huge tactical mistake), the result being the Roman\u2019s built a fort and established a foothold (the Romans may never have taken Britain if they had not built this fort). Boudicca didn\u2019t make this mistake, she gives the Romans no quarter whatsoever, but this was after Roman rule! The tribes had entirely different (almost diametrically opposed) philosophies to the Romans, the Romans expanded their territories to essentially tax them, the Celts used their surplus to trade for the other things they needed to improve their way of life. Before the Roman occupation, the Celts were advancing and after the Romans left they recovered. There was a high cost to pay for essential straight roads and writing, but actually not much else. Although Rome advanced in terms of more sophisticated cities and Palaces for the Roman elite, the Empire itself produced lower outputs year on year. So according to the definition of a civilisation, the state of most social and technical advancement, it was not civilisation as its outputs contracted, eventually resulting in collapse. Rome did not have the benefit of modern-day economics to appreciate that this was unsustainable, the purpose of the explanation is more so the reader may appreciate why the Celts and Germanic tribes may have so aggressively resisted Roman rule. There is very little technical development at this time, the Roman essential rolled out technologies that were already technically demonstrated, their organisational abilities are largely limited to their military pursuits (if their organisation could have been applied to raising economic outputs this would have had a transformational effect where the empire may have been hugely stable and longer-lasting than it was). There is little to suggest Rome improved the life for the principalities under Roman rule, beyond those appointed to administer the lands. Perhaps the Celts and Germanic tribes wanted to trade their own surplus for other things they needed, in any event, many were prepared to die rather than have their surplus taken. They may have had a point, the output is down to 2/3rd over the course of the Western Roman Empire, 27 BC \u2013 476 AD, the only other time this occurred is Bronze Age collapse around 1250BCE, these strategies are essentially the same, raiding to take another's resource, in the latter case conquest and holding the lands to levy tribute.  Source Ian Morris. Outputs for social development are: Organisation, Energy Consumption, War-making and Information. The Index goes up to 1000, today. The Celts are civilised in the sense that they know how to increase their own outputs and advance, the Romans do not when empire output is considered, other than by increasing tribute by the conquest of more lands. This manifests as a debasement of the currency, the silver (value) went elsewhere.  https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/classics/intranets/staff/butcher/debasement_and_decline.pdf I think the Celts felt their lands were being raped, there was no incentive to produce more under Roman rule. There are few accounts written by the celts, but one suggests that Celts thought their lands were being turned into a desert, e.g. becoming increasing unproductive. Trade almost stops with the Romans, it became tribute flowing one way into Rome coffers and that's the point, you don\u2019t get anything useful back to be able to advance your own way of life in exchange. The Early people of the British Isles, in Britanny and including the Celtiberians (Spain) (more generally referred to as Celts) were known to trade across Europe which they would have been unable or at least severely hampered from doing so under Roman rule. I think the Celts will have thought the Roman way backwards and arguably was (or at least the antithesis of civilised) by the modern definition: to advance. I don\u2019t think they would have considered the Romans barbarians, this is a Greek term for anyone non-Greeks, the Romans adopted the term as they had Greek tutors. I\u2019ve not written this for upvotes, rather to give a more balanced view of what Rome may have represented from the perspective of the Provinces which very little is written about.What actually happen when the Romans invaded.

            "answer_text": "Regarding Tacitus\u2019 speech attributed to Calgacus. As the Romans would not have heard this speech there is no way they knew what, if anything, was said. It\u2019s made up bunk in other words, speeches like these were often used to criticise aspects of Roman life at the time couched in words of the outsider looking in. Tacitus was writing to aggrandise his father in law. The Agricola was a book in homage to that man. Everything in it is how Agricola did better than his predecessors including criticisms of past administrators like Suetonius. Agricola was touted as a benevolent administrator who encouraged the love of Roman culture even amongst the barbarians. Most of Calgacus\u2019 speech is how Romans are oppressors which is mirroring the criticisms Tacitus has for administrators prior to Agricola taking over Britain as governor. It\u2019s an ah ha! moment for the barbarian king, he\u2019s telling his warriors how bad things will be, but he\u2019s mistaken in thinking the Romans are oppressors. Vanquishers yes, but it\u2019s a benevolent servitude because Rome is just so great. There are claims of the various subject races of the Empire regaining their freedom but the actual point being made is that they don\u2019t want it, they\u2019re happier being Romans. The one German cohort that does desert, ends up destitute in boats they don\u2019t know how to sail having lost many of their comrades. They\u2019re regarded as pirates by the fleets of the northern German tribes and captured where they\u2019re sold into slavery. The message is don\u2019t leave the bosom of Rome. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that the Romans called the Teutons (Germanics) and Celts (Gauls) barbarians for other reasons than just their cruel behaviours. For example, the Gauls appalled the Romans and Greeks by not diluting their wine with water. They considered these barbarians as uncouth, uneducated and lacking a government as well as artistic, architectural and engineering skills. And, they were right. As an interesting aside during the German Nazi period Himmler searched for the original Tacitus Manuscript to confirm that the early Germans were considered by this Roman chronicler as tall and beautiful noble people. When his research team came across the original manuscript held by an Italian nobleman they made a copy. Himmler was most disappointed to find that Tacitus described his early German ancestors as uncouth, ugly and filthy. Back then the Romans considered themselves as the superior race and the Germanic peoples as \u2018sub-humans\u2019. Who knew? Also Tacitus did not differentiate between the Western Slavs and the Germanic people he encountered in his unflattering descriptions. So it was back to the drawing board for Herr Himmler in trying to prove the existence of an early German pure noble and beautiful race. ",

Everybody agreed that the Greeks were superior in civilization to all others, even if they didn\u2019t agree that their own language was gibberish (which is what the word barbarian refers to). That did not hinder Celts and Germanics in attacking Greek sanctuaries and plundering them; quite the contrary, that was a way of getting some civilization for oneself. When Rome conquered Greece, they showed more respect; they could afford it, because they had been deeply influenced by Greek culture for centuries already. That\u2019s not to say that people were any less ethnocentric in antiquity than today, it\u2019s just that they were much more at ease with hierarchies and with not necessarily being on top of all of them themselves. Furthermore, civilization wasn\u2019t linked up with technological sophistication the way we conceive of it now; it wasn\u2019t necessarily less prone to famine and military defeat than less developed communities.

            "answer_text": "The short answer is no. The context is this: the Romans considered any \u201cuncivilized\u201d peoples to be barbarians. The Celts especially but most likely the Germans as well thought of themselves as civilized and they certainly knew the Romans and Greeks were civilized. The Celts probably looked at the Germans as barbarians and probably included the Scythians, Alans, and Sarmatians and the other steppes horse cultures as barbarians as well. It all depends on how a particular culture looked at the cultures around them that determines whether they considered them to be barbarians. ",

Extensive use of chariots in Britain suggested the use of well-maintained roads and there were several capital \"cities\" in the south-eats of England which are still major cities today.Slavery may or may not alr3ady have existed in the barbarian world, but the spread of Roman rule certainly encouraged and exacerbated the slave trade.These peoples traded and explored over a wide area, having knowledge of Iceland and Norway.
