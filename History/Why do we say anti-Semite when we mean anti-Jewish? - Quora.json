            "answer_text": "Good question. \u201cAnti-Jewish\u201d would be a more fitting term. The term \u201cAnti-Semitism\u201d was invented by a German Anti-Semite, Wilhelm Marr, 1879. It is interesting that a racist Jew hater got to invent the term for his moral ailment and now the whole world uses it as the legitimate term. The truth is that the term \u201cSemitic,\u201d properly used, denotes a family of languages, like \u201cIndo-European,\u201d and not a \u201cracial\u2019 or genetic or ethnic or cultural category. Antisemitism - Wikipedia \u201cIn 1879 German journalist Wilhelm Marr published a pamphlet, Der Sieg des Judenthums \u00fcber das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet (The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective) in which he used the word Semitismus interchangeably with the word Judentum to denote both \"Jewry\" (the Jews as a collective) and \"jewishness\" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit). \u201cThis use of Semitismus was followed by a coining of \"Antisemitismus\" which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a people and opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture. His next pamphlet, Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums \u00fcber das Judenthum (The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit, 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word Antisemitismus, \"antisemitism\". \u2018 ",

            "answer_text": "It is called generalization bs. What are semites? They are the people asserted to have been born from Shem, the brother of Ham and Yapeth, who was one of the famous patriarchs in an abrahamic faith. Anyone who is of the linage or Shem is a Semite by definition, and that would include the whole Middle East and more by now. If you are against semites, you are against all of these people. The Jews aren\u2019t the only semites and being against modern Jews is neither racist nor antisemitc, because not only is there not a proof you hate all Shem\u2019s descendants Judaism is a religion and has been treated as such after the Israelites returned to their land and lost their customs and converted their neighbors which they have conquered to their faith, making them so mixed I can\u2019t tell what they are.
