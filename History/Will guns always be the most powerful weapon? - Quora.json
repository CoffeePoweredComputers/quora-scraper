            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll try to answer this rather awkward question. As others have pointed out, guns will never be the most powerful weapon. So, let me interpret your question in this way: are guns the most powerful weapon available to an individual person? No. Others have mentioned bombs. Good answer. Guns require a person to aim, reload, move around, avoid the police, chase victims about, etc, etc. A bomb is so much better. It can destroy entire buildings in an instant, can also kill first responders, creates a neighborhood-disrupting mess, and allows the bomber to escape. But, here\u2019s another excellent option: a car, truck, or construction vehicle. No one suspects a vehicle when it moves into an area. An ordinary automobile smashing at high speed into a crowd at a sporting event, a movie premiere, a que at a mass transportation center during rush hour, or a music festival or racing event can kill and maim 50 people or more in seconds. A large construction vehicle can defeat barriers, crash into a stretch limousine, a commuter train, or a crowd at the entrance of a building. Toronto is the most recent of many deliberate attacks involving vehicles Detailed instructions for bombs and suggestions for the use of vehicles for mass murder can be found online. Components for bombs are cheap and readily available. If you think about it, handguns are only a little better than knives or swords for committing mass murder. Lots of gun-armed assailants have been stopped by unarmed heroes who took control of the situation. If someone could wave a magic wand and make all guns in the hands of terrorists, criminals, and maniacs disappear, it wouldn\u2019t eliminate murder and mayhem in the world. Bad people would just find another way to kill. Heck, they already have. ",

            "answer_text": "In general terms, bombs, especially nuclear bombs, are the most powerful weapons ever invented. Some sort of gun will probably always be the most powerful man portable weapon, because a strong man can carry a weapon capable of firing \u201cshells\u201d which are in essence large or giant bullets that explode when they hit the target, or come close. These shells ARE in essence bombs. There\u2019s a major possible exception though, depending on how you define the term \u201cweapon\u201d. It\u2019s now possible to create a new deadly disease in a laboratory, and such a disease has the potential to kill hundreds of millions of people. It could be deadly enough to wipe out almost everybody, all over the world. And it could be carried in a little glass vial that would easily fit in a pants pocket or pack of cigarettes. ",
