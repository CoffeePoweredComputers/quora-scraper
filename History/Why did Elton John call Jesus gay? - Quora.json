            "answer_text": "Well, you are dragging up a story from 2010\u2026 Still, Elton John claimed rightly that Jesus was compassionate, loving and forgiving[1] . And then made an interesting point about the lack of compassion, lack of forgiveness and downright hatred thrown at gay people. Perhaps his provocative comment was to highlight the hypocrisy of many religious people when it comes to homosexuality. Whether Jesus was gay or not, I can\u2019t help feeling that he would have been far more compassionate and loving towards the gay community than some of those who worship in his name.

He is described as \u201cthe Disciple Jesus Loved\u201d and reclined with Jesus and laid on his chest at the last supper. This doesn\u2019t make him gay, but to be fair, I don\u2019t know many men who would like a guy lying on their chest. There are other things as well, but it\u2019s really important we don\u2019t view the bible through our culture but try and understand it in the context and time that it was written. ",
