            "answer_text": "I don't know what you mean by why he is not popular. You mean popular in the sense that the pop culture don't receive him? or in the sense that he isn't well known, or well liked? The Jewish God is the creator, whether people acknowledges him or not, he is still the God from whom all existence came into being and all existence is sustain by him. He decided to choose a people\u2019s from which he will make his name known throughout the corners of the earth, and this was the Jewish people. He then manifested to his creation in human form in the person of Jesus Christ. And if you mean why doesn't pop culture widely accept him, or why isn't he well liked by the mainstream; well that is a very subjective statement however the Bible states that some people like the darkness better than the light, Jesus is light and if they\u2019d come to Jesus their evil deeds would be expose, but if they deny him they can persist in their injustices without fear of exposure. Jesus Christ the Jewish God, the Christian God, the creator of existence is widely known and not arguably, but uncontested the most famous person that\u2019s ever existed and as long as men want to follow their own path they wouldn't like to be admonish by God who asks and requires a higher standard of morality and justice, a perfect standard. However he knows it is impossible for us to accomplish his supreme standards for we are fallen creatures that is why Jesus is the answer, in Jesus we please God in Justice and morality because he is perfect and never sinned.

            "answer_text": "My answer (which will not be popular) is that Jews worship a unitary, indivisible, incorporeal, numinous God, who demands a specific set of behaviors from Jews (the 'Covenant'). He's not popular because a) the Covenant is specific to Jews, who make up a tiny fraction of a fraction of people on earth, and b) it's hard. Unlike Christianity, the Jewish God isn't terribly concerned with what goes on in your head; he cares what you do; and there are 613 commandments to uphold. He's a loving and forgiving God, but he's not about cheap grace. Christians worship a resurrected demigod who is popular because he's all about what happens in your head: since the apostle Paul divorced Christianity from the commandments, anything goes. Lie, cheat, steal, commit murder, rape, pedophilia, adultery\u2014as soon as you say you're 'saved' you're 'forgiven' and free to go have another roaring good time free of consequences (the Renaissance Popes, Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Baker, and Roy Moore spring to mind\u2026 among others). Who wouldn't prefer a god like that? ",
