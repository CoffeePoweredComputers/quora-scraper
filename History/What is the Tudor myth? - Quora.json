            "answer_text": "Have you ever heard of the phrase \u201cWinners write history?\u201d This is where the Tudor myth comes into play. It involves the Tudors twisting the history of the century before their rise, mainly in the case of King Richard III, in order to glorify themselves, or to make themselves be seen as the rightful Kings and Queens of England. To be legitimised, if you will. The Tudor myth depicted the previous century (15th) and especially the Wars of the Roses as an era of bloodshed, war and instability, and therefore contrasting this horrid period with their \u201cgolden age\u201d, if you will, which is an age of peace, order and stability. Because Henry Tudor essentially usurped the throne, (becoming Henry VII) he had to make his usurpation justified, as his claim to the throne in a dynastic sense was\u2026 questionable. A century before, Henry IV usurped the throne, leaving England to face a century of disorder and civil. The Tudors did not want that to happen again. The people of England had to be convinced that Henry Tudor usurped the throne \u201cfor them\u201d, that it was a good thing he had ascended the throne and that the future would be promising and orderly. That\u2019s also why Richard III has received such a bad name during the Tudor era, being depicted as a maligned, psychopathic, murderous hunchback, when in reality he was quite loyal and there is no contemporary evidence to condemn him of the crimes he allegedly committed. (Allegedly = according to the Tudors.) By depicting Richard III as evil and a bad King, Henry Tudor was justified in fighting Richard III on the battlefield at Bosworth and taking the crown for himself. No one would dare challenge his claim to power that way. Henry Tudor, and the subsequent Tudor generations, were therefore legitimised due to their twisting of history, as seen by the common people. If you are confused about the names in this answer please let me know and I will break it down further.
