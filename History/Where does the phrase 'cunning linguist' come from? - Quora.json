            "answer_text": "Joe Devney's answer probably has some truth to it, but if indeed 'cunning linguist' were something that has been invented many different times independently you would think it would have many hits over the centuries.  It turns out a Google N-gram search turns up precisely zero hits for the phrase before 1968 or so, when all of a sudden it turns up three times: in satirical Socialist poetry published in Partisan Review, in a book about graffiti 'The Scrawl of the Wild' (yes, that is its real name), and (surprise surprise!) in pornography!   The Cunning Linguist, An Adult Novel, by Troy Conway Troy Conway was also the author of numerous other punny, porny works of adult fiction, including: Turn the Other Sheik, All Screwed Up, It's Not How Long You Make It, and Will the Real Rod Please Stand Up? Anyway, I'm pretty convinced by the Google N-Gram data that this grande oeuvre by Conway, and this alone, got the ball rolling:   It has now (cough) spawned something of a minor industry in punning, including:   and:   and:   and let's not forget:   ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read with amusement the answer to this question that put forth the idea that this phrase did not exist prior to 1968. I personally used it in high school and I graduated in 1965. The first time I heard it spoken was by my friend Fred Y. We had just come across the word cunnilingus, probably because we were nerdy teenagers poring over an article in Playboy, and Fred came up with what I thought was a clever bit of wordplay. Subsequently I heard other people use it and was surprised to find it so widely accepted. I shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised really. This is one of those natural, easily deduced word associations, like \u201csmart feller\u201d and \u201cfart smeller\u201d. In the case of a new and unusual word like cunnilingus, it\u2019s reasonable for us to mentally search for similar, but more familiar, sounds. Cunning and linguist, both known words, flash immediately to mind and combined, provide a satisfying pun like response that pleases our ears. We revel in our own cleverness! I file this one under \u201cGreat minds think alike . . . and idiots seldom differ!\u201d ",

As I recall, he said he had found a striking phrase in a translation of some German philosopher: \u201cFrom the mouths of cunning linguists flows the spittle of wisdom.\u201d Having little interest in German philosophers at the time, I never asked him to be more specific. I\u2019ve always remembered the sentence, but I have yet to find any reason to insert it in a conversation. I have wondered from time to time if he was mocking a slightly naive undergraduate. ",
