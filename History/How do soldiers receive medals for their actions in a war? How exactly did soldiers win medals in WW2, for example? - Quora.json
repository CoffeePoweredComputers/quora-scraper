            "answer_text": "Jon Davis has this mostly covered, but there is are some things that need some clarification. You get \"awards\" either from a particular event or for service. Depending upon the event and the actions of the individual determines the level of award received. The higher the award, the higher the level of command that is required to authorize the award.  \"Service\" awards are usually for doing a good job over a period of time. The higher the level of responsibility and influence, the higher the service award. Lower ranks don't have much of an area of influence, so they end up with lower awards for consistently doing a good job, while a battalion commander that runs a good unit will see a higher service award, because a battalion command is a lot of responsibility. Awards for heroism are based upon a single event. Some awards can only be received for heroism in combat (you can't get the Medal of Honor for service.) Other awards might be for achievement, or heroism. In the case of an award for heroism the only difference is that it might have a device affixed to it (usually a bronze \"v\", but it depends on the particular award.) There are other awards for things like participating in a particular campaign or operation, completing leadership schools, etc. These are euphemistically referred to as \"thanks for coming badges\" anyone that was there for long enough gets one regardless of performance.  So to get down to the specifics of the question: Let's say that it's your job to drive a truck and deliver supplies. Over the course of a deployment you were always on time, your truck was always maintained, and your 'customers' wanted for nothing: you probably have a 'service award' coming.   One day while driving your truck, you are ambushed and your co-driver is wounded. You pull him to cover, apply first aid, and then organize a counter attack that wipes out a numerically superior force of the enemy: you probably have an award for 'heroism' coming. ",

            "answer_text": "If you haven't read Jon Davis's answer to How do soldiers receive medals for their actions in a war? How exactly did soldiers win medals in WW2, for example? -- you should. It's a good background answer to this suprisingly common question. I'm going to cover two specific scenarios, both very different from each other, both of which earned medals for the soldiers involved. I also want to highlight some specific awards and how they can be earned.    My unit's CIB ceremony in Baghdad In 2003, in Iraq, I was deployed with Alpha Company, 3rd Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment.  During our tour in Iraq, we \"did our job.\" We had a few guys who did \"hero shit,\" the kind of things you read about in famous award citations. We had \"that guy\" who was hit by enemy gunfire and continued to direct his team, positioning them to pull security and stabilizing the more severely wounded while refusing any attention for himself until the critically wounded medic was taken care of.  We also had a fat, lazy platoon sergeant who did absolutely nothing of value for the unit and made notoriously bad decisions, was universally disliked, and rarely left the FOB unless he absolutely had to.  They both were awarded BSMs -- Bronze Star Medals.  In the first case, the soldier involved was a junior enlisted man (I think he was an E-4 at the time).  He received the BSM with V Device. The V Device indicates the award was issued for valor and heroism in combat. When issued with the V Device, it's the fourth highest military award for valor in the order of precedence (from the top, Medal of Honor --> Distinguished Service/AF/Navy Cross --> Silver Star --> Bronze Star (with V)).   So, this is a big deal.  In the latter case, the soldier involved was a senior NCO (an E-7 at the time, promoted into this position because it was where he'd be least likely to cause trouble). He received the BSM without the V Device, because every single officer, and all NCOs of E-7 and higher, received it at the end of the tour. Presumably, this was to help their promotion potential (while those of us on the bottom of the totem pole, who put in the real work and bore the greatest risk, got screwed over).  Everyone from E-6 and below (myself included) received the Army Commendation Medal.  There is an argument that can be made that medals of this type should not be automatically awarded. I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole, except to point out that in the current system for how promotions are paneled in the military (especially in the Army and USAF; to a lesser extent the Navy) this is unrealistic and it is a fact of life that undeserving people will get awards simply due to their rank.    The Combat Infantryman's Badge There is also the broader question of medals given out simply for doing one's job. For instance, I didn't do anything in particular to merit the National Defense Service Medal -- I just served during a time of war, and boom. Criteria met. In comparison, I do not value it compared to the one award that I have that truly matters, the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB).  In order to merit the coveted CIB, you must be an infantryman or special forces (11 or 18 series MOS) who personally served in active ground combat, in an infantry (or special forces) unit, and actively been engaged with the enemy.  Just being in the combat zone is not enough. Being attached to an infantry unit does not suffice. Whether other people in the unit merit the award is not applicable to you; you cannot get this by osmosis.  Combat Medics are eligible for the close-second consolation prize of the Combat Medical Badge; while we hold it in very high esteem, it reflects a different set of risks and recognition from that of the infantryman.   I mention this because it brings up an interesting scenario. See, in otherwise identical circumstances, and with otherwise similar missions and jobs, an infantryman may earn a CIB while a cavalry scout doing the exact same thing would get diddly squat. Tankers also have a direct combat arms responsibility for which they would not be recognized. So, backed by this legitimate concern, and echoed by the raving hordes of jealous pogues, the Army created the CAB, a \"runner up\" award for everyone else who can't qualify for a CIB or CMB. At this point, well over 100,000 of them have been awarded in OIF and OEF alone. There are, as you might be able to see, both positive and negative aspects to this award. It's great that tankers and cav scouts are getting recognition for their combat engagements. They absolutely deserve it.  The MP who has to run to the mortar bunker while walking to the showers? Not so much.  Which brings me to my point. Medals don't tell the story. They can provide recognition, but it is the soldier who provides the action that merits the medal -- even if that action is as minimal as showing up.  It's not about \"winning\" something. It's about \"what did you do?\"  Most people have never heard of the Shok Valley battle. It was a not-heavily publicized engagement involving a Special Forces team (ODA 3336) on a mission to capture an insurgent warlord, deep within his own territory.   Immediately upon entering the valley, ODA 3336 was ambushed by a massive enemy force. 15 U.S. operators and 100 Afghani commandos on the friendly side, and between 200-400 hardened insurgent forces on the enemy side. I'm going to provide two different ways of looking at what happened next.  First, let's review the notations from the direct fire report of the battle. I'll skip to the highlights (note: some times/locations were redacted) :  At 0258Z, TF Bushmaster reported receiving small arms fire from an unknown number of AAF.Elements in heavy contact on objective, with casualties, decided medevac on station as part of assault package. At 0337Z, TF Bushmaster requested an urgent and priority MEDEVAC for 2x US MIL WIA. 1x patient has gunshot wound to ankle and leg, 2x patient has gunshot wound to the arm. Total BDA at this time is 2x US MIL WIA and 1x LN Terp KIA.At 0356Z, TF Bushmaster reported an additional 2x US MIL WIA. At 0358Z, TF Bushmaster reported receiving small arms fire from high ground around their LOC. At 0417Z, TF Bushmaster reports effective sniper fire from a building roof north of their position at this time. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, PROFET 72 reports ARF inserted at \u2014\u2014\u2014, unable to pick up any casualties ATT. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, PROFET 72 reports ARF is engaged with INS, SAF and sniper fire from buildings, working CASat this time. AT \u2014\u2014\u2014, Hawg-51 is rotating off station, Hawg,-53 coming on station at this time. At 0503Z, TF Bushmaster reports they are pinned down by sniper fire north of their position. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, TF Bushmaster reports they are combat ineffective and request reinforcement at this time. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, TF Bushmaster reports they are going to break COMMS at this time and relay COMMS through ARF. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, TF Bushmaster reported MEDEVAC HLZ 42S XE 2850 0050; 6 x WIA located there; precedence and type unknown ATT; HLZ is not secure ATT. At 0513 TF Bushmaster reported that there are 50-100 insurgents moving to reinforce against Bushmaster elements from the SW. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, TF Bushmaster requested MEDEVACs for 4x US MIL WIA, and 2x ANA WIA. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, TF Bushmaster reported they have established a defensive position in a small building. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, TFBushmaster reported consolidating forces at north end of Wadi, assessing number of casualties ATT and reporting insurgents on high ground all around their location, requesting CAS to engage insurgents location. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, TF Bushmaster reports that there are 9 total casualties; status of 3 new ones unknown ATT. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, Dustoff-34 reports recieving fire. At 0616Z, TF Bushmaster reported receiving fire from all around their position ATT, working to link up with GR 10 and 12 and move to initial HLZ at \u2014\u2014\u2014. At 0618Z, TF Bushmaster reports using CAS at this time to engage insurgents and need more suppression from CASATT. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, TF Bayonet MEDOPS reports tracking 6 WIA were picked up from HLZ/POI, and are enroute to JAF ATT. At\u2014\u2014\u2014, TF Bushmaster reports 6 casualties at their location, and requesting a MEDEVAC at this time. At 0639Z, TFBushmaster reported 1x US MIL WIA with gunshot wound to the pelvis and arm, 1x ANA with broken femur and assessing the 4x remaining ANAWIA. At \u2014\u2014\u2014, TF Bushmaster reported 8 detainees for Exfil. At\u2014\u2014\u2014, TF Bushmaster reported slash on 2 targets with GBUs. BDA 4x US MIL WIA, 5x ANA WIA, 1x ANA KIA, and 1x LN TERP KIA. So that's pretty bad. A bunch of casualties, several US forces wounded, and it sounds like they got pinned down really badly and couldn't do a whole lot. Super factual, in that this is basically word-for-word what was being reported at the time, but not really helpful to figuring out the details, the real feeling, of what was going on.    ODA 3336 in Shok Valley Now, let's look at a narrative summary of what happened in the middle of all that.   In the initial salvo of fire from enemy positions, consisting of small arms, RPGs, and heavy machine-gun fire, the local national interpreter was immediately killed and the SF communications sergeant seriously wounded. An ANA commando attempted to treat the SF sergeant and was himself shot and wounded severely. They are pinned down on the side of a wadi, 60 feet up from the valley floor and highly exposed. Specialist Carter leaves cover and runs through the open to recover the wounded comms sergeant and drags him back to cover, while the ODA's commanding officer (Captain Walton) provides cover fire. They then switch off, with the captain running out to drag back the ANA commando. They then switch off again, with Carter running out to grab the sergeants radio bag to give to the team's JTAC in order to call in close air support. The USAF combat controller attached to the team begins calling in non-stop air strikes from A-10s, F-15's and AH-64s while attempting to maneuver into better positions. However, now the SF intelligence sergeant is shot, and requires a tourniquet in the thigh. The soldier who treats him is then shot through the foot, and would later lose it.  A third SF operator's leg is nearly ripped off by a heavy round.  He tourniquets himself, injects himself with morphine, folds what is left of his leg upwards and then ties it to his belt, so he can continue to shoot without having to hold onto it. They're nearly being overrun and at one point the enemy is less than 40 feet from Carter's position. He stands his ground, lays down suppressive fire, and shields the wounded with his body as danger close air support slams into the enemy only 100 feet away.  Meanwhile everyone is running short on ammunition, between 100-200 enemy reinforcements are arriving, and it is getting dark. The team begins to exfiltrate, when their senior NCO is shot twice by a sniper, nearly severing his arm.  The route is perilous, with 20 foot drops the team must climb down in several places. At one point, the wounded cannot climb so they must be lowered down and caught by Carter, waiting below, literally falling onto his body. The rest of the team proceeds to the extract point, while the team's sniper, commanding officer, and Carter stay behind to destroy remaining equipment and weapons. The sniper covers the remainder of the team before withdrawing alone from to the extraction zone.  During the course of the battle, the JTAC/CCT directed over 50 attack runs, consisting of nearly 5,000 rounds of cannon, nine Hellfires, 162 rockets, a 2,000lb JDAM and over a dozen 500lb bombs.  Goddamn. That's some serious shit. Nobody would deny that the men of that team were engaged in some of the heaviest, fiercest fighting of modern combat history. The CCT earned the Air Force Cross (second only to the Medal of Honor) for his actions. On the Special Forces team, ten of them received the Silver Star that day, the single largest issuance of the award for a single battle since Vietnam. Nine of the recipients were SF operators from ODA 3336.  Here's the kicker: the tenth was Specialist Carter.  See, Specialist Carter was not actually Special Forces. He was what is known as a C2 cell, part of the team including the interpreter who are responsible for handling certain command and control actions on the objective. Specialist Carter was a combat cameraman. Let me say that again, in case it's not clear. He was a cameraman. Nobody ordered him to go get ambushed, save people's lives at complete disregard for his own, and to step up and be responsible for bringing the entire ODA back alive. But he did it. And we recognized him for it.  His response: \u201cMy whole thing is I do what you would do for me. I\u2019m no one special. I\u2019m just a normal person. I just did [for my team members] what [they] would do for me.\u201d   This dude is one of the most badass warriors in modern history Carter earned the same CAB for those actions as did the MP who gets mortared on their way to the showers. I guarantee you, he was not going out that morning wondering \"Hmm, what can I do today to earn a medal for myself?\" He received the Silver Star because he was an exceptional soldier. So you can see, the medal does not tell the story. The soldier tells the story, through their actions. Sometimes that story is mundane, checking off criteria from a box. Sometimes that story is heroic, exceeding beyond the wildest stretches of human expectations. ",

            "answer_text": "Medals for valor in combat are not \"won.\" That needs to be made very clear. Medals awarded for acts of valor are presented for actions a soldier takes where there was exceptional risk to themselves and their fellow soldiers. They aren't Xbox achievements that soldiers \"unlock\" by virtue of having completed a mission. Granted, there are definitely medals in the U.S. military that are awarded for little more than \"didn't screw up,\" but I don't think that's what OP was getting at.  The criteria by which a decoration may be considered, at least for the U.S. military, are established by Executive Order - owing to the President's status as commander-in-chief - and refined by Department of Defense regulations and further down to each individual service. Nominations for an award are usually initiated by the soldier's commanding officer who likely witnessed the action meriting commendation, and then that recommendation works its way up the chain of command to the level established by regulation.

There are dozens of medals and awards and each has its own criteria. To follow your example, for most awards it's essentially go there, patrol there, shit happens there, you respond and address said shit above and beyond the call of duty, in a meritorious fashion, be a billy badass, get shot, save some lives, walk 500 miles and don't drink water for a week..... You'll probably get a medal for that. ",
