            "answer_text": "No. Russian Intelligentsia, which was the main driving force behind the Revolution, considered gambling one of the gravest social vices \u2014 not in the least because much of their own numbers suffered from terrible gambling addiction, Pushkin and Dostoyevky being the most ptominent from the literary circles alone \u2014 so when they came to power, they outlawed any form of gambling aside from simple low-stakes betting (but only on certain sports like horse racing, there wasn\u2019t betting on football/soccer, for example) or lotteries (because lotteries were good for state coffers). All other gambling, especially pure games of chance, were illegal and carried quite heavy penalties, especially organizing and profiting from it. Some small-scale activities such as private card cames for money were tacitly tolerated, but only as long as they didn\u2019t cause social disturbances. As is, no one would arrest you for playing a couple of rounds of poker, whist, bridge or preferans with your friends on a Friday night with 10 kopecks per stake. But if you\u2019d play 10 rubles a stake and one of the players lost all his possessions and then hung himself, or, God forbid, you\u2019d be found to operate a regular gambling circle \u2014 well, to the prison you go. In fact, a lot of malinas mentioned in other answer were technically busted exactly as the illegal gambling houses, as this was usually the easiest criminal activity to find a court-proof evidence of.

No, gambling was illegal and carried out on individual basis by professional and amateur gamblers in long distance trains, hotels, beaches etc. The closest thing to casinos Soviet Union had were \u201cmalina\u2019s\u201d - flats or private houses where criminals gathered for discussion of activities, recreation and doing illegal business.
