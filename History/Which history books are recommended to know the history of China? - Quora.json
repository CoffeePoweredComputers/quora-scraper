            "answer_text": "I would start with a broad survey book. I'm going to assume you don't know any Chinese. Some would suggest Jonathan Spence's In Search of Modern China. That's not a bad suggestion\u2014it\u2019s a readable, single volume survey that covers the time period from the Ming to the modern day. If you know absolutely nothing, I would suggest that book to kind of get your feet wet. That said, it's a (fairly) limited timeframe to be dealing with, and while the book does technically begin with the Ming, it's really focusing on the mid-Qing to the modern day. If you're ready to put a (bit) more time in, I'd suggest China: A History, in two volumes, by Harold M. Tanner. This one is also a bit biased toward the Qing and Modern era, given the first book is the Neolithic to the Qing and the entire second book is from the Qing to the PRC. But it at least gives you a quick sketch of the sequence of major events before the Ming. You'd want this sketch, because from here you'll probably go into Harvard University's History of Imperial China series. This is a six-book series covering Imperial Chinese history, specifically the Early Dynasties and Han, the Han-Tang interregnum, the Tang, the Song, the Yuan-Ming Dynasties and finally the Qing. They're detailed and scholarly works, so they're not precisely readable in a pop sense, but they're very good. That said, the reason we wanted to read the books above before diving into these is that these books aren't organized chronologically, but thematically\u2014they\u2019re a set of fascicles on specific topics (e.g., \u201cManorialism during the Han,\u201d \u201cBuddhism during the Tang,\u201d stuff like that). If you have no clue what's going on when, the books can be a little confusing, though they have a brief narrative on the course of the era. Past that, I'd recommend two things: First: Get Chinese History: A New Manual by Endymion Wilkinson. This is essentially a huge phonebook of a bibliography on pretty much every era and topic in Chinese history. Want to find out about pottery during the Tang? Wilkinson can point you to twenty (or whatever) different articles on it in Chinese and English (and sometimes in Japanese). Use it to help get some direction on a topic that specifically interests you, if you come across it. There's also a large corpus of more focused texts, both popular and academic, if you decide you really like a specific era. Again, though, mostly modern eras and events are represented. You probably won't find many books in English about, say, the purging of the Buddhists during the Tang. That brings us to our second point: learn Putonghua and probably some Classical Chinese. The only real exception here is if you are solely interested in post-1911 China, in which case you might honestly be okay with just Putonghua. If you get really serious, learn both Simplified and Traditional (the crossover is easier than you'd expect if you become competent in one). I say learn Classical Chinese because if you read history books in Chinese, I can attest that they love quoting directly from the source material, so they'll end up throwing lines of Classical Chinese at you and you may well be left to decipher them on your own. Also, students of Chinese history are really, really lucky. There is an immense corpus of historical documentation, annals, official and unofficial histories, local gazettes, and so on and so forth, and they're mostly easily available. In many cases, they're also a pleasure to read, composed as they were by hyper-literate scholars raised on poetry. Many, many of these works are available (and annotated, even interactively!) online. So learning the language and allowing yourself to dig into the source material is going to be great. Of course, all of this is years in the future, and probably China: A History and The Search for Modern China will be all you need. But it really is a huge, vast, fertile plain of knowledge and historical commentary, it's hard not to get giddy about the absolute wealth of material out there. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Early to Imperial China The Archaeology of China: From the Late Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age by Liu, Li ( 2012) This book is recommended for its compelling points about, well everything. It sheds light on topics ranging from the structures of societies, agriculture, tools and warfare, regional and inter-cultural influences on development, to even diet and health. Most of the research comes from archaeological studies as well as interpreting inscriptions, artifacts, and other reputable academic sources.  Defining Chu: Image and Reality in Ancient China by Cook, Constance A. ( 1999) The immense Chu state dominated the south for centuries throughout most of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States era until its final succumb to the armies of Qin that emerged from the west. Despite certain faults, this collection of essays is the best work that I know of which deals directly with this kingdom, from the territorial expansion and contraction of Chu to the nature of Chu art to its cultural legacy in the Han dynasty. I especially recommend Jenny So's .  The Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han by Lewis, Mark Edward ( 2007) The first in Timothy Brook's admirable Chinese History project with Harvard University Press. The goal was to create relatively short, accessible texts that were also high quality scholarship for each of the major periods in Imperial chinese history. Mark Edward Lewis provides the first three. The series does not take the more direct route, that one would find in the Cambridge histories. Instead of narrative history, Lewis focuses on material culture, as well as legal, religious, and societal structures of the Qin/Han.  China Between Empires: The Northern and Southern Dynasties by Lewis, Mark Edward ( 2008) The second in the series picks up where Lewis left off, at the end of the Han. This volume covers the period between 220-618 CE. However, for those interested in narrative history, this book will disappoint. For those interested in the major changes and transformations that occurred in Chinese society at the time, this book will be greatly appreciated.  China's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty by Lewis, Mark Edward ( 2009) Divided between sections on history, geography, the economy, society, and culture, this book is comprehensive without being overloaded--whether your interests are agriculture, the status of women, or the nature of the poet in society you will find information here. It also does well at torpedoing national mythology.  Daily Life in Traditional China: The Tang Dynasty by Benn, Charles ( 2001) Extremely accessible book that is based completely on secondary sources and cites other reference books. It is a very handy introductory primer to what life generally was like for the average Chinese person. While obviously focused on the Tang Dynasty, it is a solid place for a start as serious readers/history buffs can build off of this solid foundation as they research more on their own. It is a very light read compared to the more academic texts that I usually recommend but personally this one of my favorites.  Imperial China 900-1800 by Mote, Frederick W. ( 2000) a tremendous work of longue dur\u00e9e scholarship from one of the venerable old guard of American Sinology. This book is not only meticulously researched, but engagingly written. For narrative history of China, it is unparalleled.  Samurai Invasion: Japan's Korean War 1592 -1598 by Turnbull, Stephen ( 2002) The second of the three books on the Imjin War, Turnbull writes from a mostly Japanese perspective. His book tends to favor the Japanese over the Ming and the Koreans.  A Dragon's Head and a Serpent's Tail: Ming China and the First Great East Asian War, 1592\u20131598 by Swope, Kenneth M. ( 2009) The newest of the three English language books on the Imjin War, Swope writes from a Chinese perspective and uses a lot of Chinese primary sources. Though his text has been criticized for providing flawed information, as a military historian, Swope gives an excellent account of the capabilities of the Ming military. It is best to read , , and Swope together.  The Imjin War: Japan's Sixteenth-Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China by Hawley, Samuel ( 2005) One of the three main English accounts of the Imjin War, perhaps the only thing that comes close to a \"world war\" in East Asia. This is not the most comprehensive text on the war but it gives an excellent introduction. Hawley uses mostly Korean sources for this book and writes from a Korean perspective, so the book does suffer from a pro-Korean bias.  Late Imperial to Modern China God's Chinese Son: The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan by Spence, Jonathan D. ( 1996) While not the best or the most in-depth text in English on the Taiping Rebellion, Spence's text is probably the most accessible to readers and is the second best available. This is a wonderful piece of work covering the entire rebellion from Hong Xiuquan's early life, to the Taiping ideology, to its battles with the Qing and internal rivalries, and finally to its fall.  The Origins of the Boxer Uprising by Esherick, Joseph W. ( 1988) Contra popular belief, the Boxer Uprising was neither a cult nor a rebellion, but rather a mass movement centered around Shandong that combined separate strains of vigilantism, anti-imperialism, shamanism and the Chinese theater.  Reform and Revolution in China: The 1911 Revolution in Hunan and Hubei by Esherick, Joseph W. ( 1976) Focuses on the causes of the 1911 revolution, including the new intellectual and social elite who were distinct from the gentry but not what we would call bourgeois. During this time nationalism, feminism, anti-conformist youth movements and Westernization flourished, but in discarding so much of traditional China the new urban elite became unable to relate to the needs of the rest of the country, setting the stage for the success of communism and the end of all of these trends. The Abortive Revolution: China Under Nationalist Rule, 1927-1937 by Eastman, Lloyd E. ( 1974) An autopsy of the Guomandong nationalists under Chiang Kai-sheck, from their insular, inefficient bureaucracy, inability to understand why the communists were so popular to their brief dabbling with fascist dictatorship.  Making Revolution: The Communist Movement in Eastern and Central China, 1937-1945 by Chen, Yung-fa ( 1986) A history of the Communist Party in China from their guerrilla tactics against the Japanese to the Cultural Revolution.  The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers by McGregor, Richard ( 2010) Never before has there been such an amazing in depth look at the inner workings of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) before the publishing of this book. McGregor's work was cut out for him because the CCP is probably one of the most secretive political regimes ever. Most Chinese people don't even know how many departments and adminstrative bodies there are, or which ones belong to the 'government' and which belong to the Party. McGregor dives deep and brings up a treasure trove of knowledge about the mechanics of the strange political system where the Party is the government while pretending not to be, putting faces to names and names to faces, and the corruption that runs to the very core of the system. He provides history and analysis while his masterful writing prevents it all from burying the reader.  Chen Village: Revolution to Globalization by Chan, Anita ( 2009) This is a beautiful book that traces the life and growth of a village in Southeast China through the entirety of the communist revolution until 2009. Its ambition is incredible, and its execution satisfies its aims. It is effectively an anthropological ethnography written by historians, and the work reflects some of the best of both disciplines. Rarely have I felt as connected to historical characters as I have in learning of the exploits of low-level, unimportant peasant officials in Chen Village. This book communicates the trends in political and social change in China in the last 60 years in a way that is hard to replicate from pure analysis.  Chinese Village, Socialist State by Friedman, Edward ( 1991) The first Western social scientists to collect data from the People's Republic of China, focusing on rural Hebei province, south of Beijing. Starting at the \"honeymoon period\" after the Communists took power, the authors focus their criticism on how Party edicts led to stagnation and immiseration for the villages, creating essentially a neo-feudal order.  China's Rise in Historical Perspective by Womack, Brantly ( 2010) If anyone is seriously interested in what trends have shaped the current Chinese political landscape, this is the book to read. The perspectives of the contributors are diverse, and so are the topics covered, which include religious cosmology, identity crises in wake of the revolution, ecological issues, and international relations.  Us Taiwan Strait Policy: The Origins of Strategic Ambiguity by Chen, Dean P. ( 2012) It provides a fantastic summary of the US approach toward China in regards to the Taiwan issue, and is the first major book to do so in regards to the Obama administration's policies. However, certainly not for casual reading. This is an academic analysis of the policy making process, and is making an argument for how to conduct US policy into the future. But in the course of its analysis it provides a fantastic history of the relationship between the US and the Taiwan issue.  Managing Sino-American Crises: Case Studies and Analysis by Swaine, Michael D. ( 2006) Pretty much THE book on the issue. By far the most extensive analysis of crisis behavior by China and America during Sino-American crises. Begins with the post-WWII period, and continues to 2006.  Charm Offensive by Thacker, William ( 2014) An excellent history and analysis of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) international politics, plays in the geopolitical arena, and how foreign policy affects domestic policy as well as vice versa. It is a concise and thorough introduction to the PRC's commitment to the 'soft power' grand strategy, and a must read for any student of the PRC's foreign policy history.  Modern China Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War by Lone, Stewart ( 2007) Fairly straightforward. Not just China but basically every major Asian conflict. It is a behemoth of information that has been collected from far and wide for the reader's convenience. It covers history, provides detailed and cited statistics, and gives insight to culture, art, social chances and upheavals, family and even romantic impact from living during all these wars. An excellent reference.  China: A New History by Fairbank, John King ( 1992) An excellent introduction to the topic by the doyen of American Sinology. China's modern history is the main concern, but the earlier periods are treated sufficiently.  The Search For Modern China by Spence, Jonathan D. ( 1990) It's a pretty good overview that starts with the Ming and goes through the late 1980s. Covers all the bases. Nothing is covered in exceptional depth (with a subject like China it rarely can be in a single book) but for a general idea of recent Chinese history it's more than adequate. Also, a very readable book.  China Throughout the Ages A History of Chinese Civilization by Gernet, Jacques ( 1972) A readable and detailed survey of Chinese history that is notable for not prejudicing modern history over earlier periods. It heavily focuses on intellectual and cultural history, and at times the details of the political history get ignored, but any survey this ambitious must make cuts. The account of the nineteenth century is particularly vivid.  This Is China: The First 5,000 Years by Yuan, Haiwang ( 2010) This should be the standard text in every introductory class to Chinese history. It is an incredibly short, brief book that is a crash course on Chinese history to the uninitiated as well as a solid quick reference for the more experienced. It is a work that runs over the surface of almost everything Chinese history has to offer and dips its head under the water at select places to try to give the reader a real taste of what lies before them. More than cover Chinese history, it is a great book to illustrate the fact that trying to understand all of Chinese history at once is impossible and is as much art and dynamic dialogue as it is inexact science and lively academia. Another must have.  The Cambridge Illustrated History of China by Ebrey, Patricia Buckley ( 1996) Incredibly beautiful. Don't let the visuals fool you into thinking this is a glorified picture book. It is a masterpiece of clear concise writing, tying together dates, places, and names so that they clarify events instead of overwhelming the reader. The images themselves are not only beautifully rendered but also masterfully picked so that they enhance the text, rather than detract from it. Finally, the author pays special attention to possible Western biases or misconceptions and handles them gracefully. This is the general reference book to get that is as enjoyable to read as it is informative as well as academically rigorous in its methodology.  Chinese Civilization: A Sourcebook by Ebrey, Patricia Buckley ( 1981) Chinese Civilization sets the standard for supplementary texts in Chinese history courses. With newly expanded material, personal documents, social records, laws, and documents that historians mistakenly ignore, the sixth edition is even more useful than its classic predecessor. A complete and thorough introduction to Chinese history and culture. Chinese Civilization sets the standard for supplementary texts in Chinese history courses. With newly expanded material, personal documents, social records, laws, and documents that historians mistakenly ignore, the sixth edition is even more useful than its classic predecessor. A complete and thorough introduction to Chinese history and culture.  Soldiers of the Dragon: Chinese Armies 1500 BC\u2013AD 1840 by Peers, Chris (C.J.) ( 2006) Osprey publishers have a wide variety of awesome military histories. You wouldn't be likely to find this in a college classroom, but that can be a plus. It's not a hard read, but extremely informative. ",
