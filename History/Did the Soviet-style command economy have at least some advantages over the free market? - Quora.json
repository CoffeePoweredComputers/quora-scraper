            "answer_text": "Yes. Soviet-style command economy is a baby of the Marxist concept of class struggle and radical social transformation. Which is why it\u2019s always a mobilization economy. The needs of the military-industrial complex and secret services are always at the center of it, because the surrounding Capitalists will always make mischief and seek its destruction. Which is why Stalinist societies boast much shorter adaptation cycles to wartime economy in comparison to market-based ones. This is the main enduring advantage of Socialism before Capitalism: during the periods of great struggle\u2014wars, pestilence, asteroid hits, pandemics\u2014it can very fast adapt to the changed situation and the character of new threats. As an example, an investment project for anything more substantial than a cowshed in the Soviet Union always needed to be signed off by government functionaries not only for its fire safety, compliance with sanitary norms and suchlike, but also for being compliant with local and national \u201cmobilization plans\u201d\u2014i.e. how exactly the building can be requisitioned for war purposes and in which time frame the moment the D-day arrives. In 1941, the Soviet government managed within weeks to disassemble, move to the east, re-assemble and put into use thousands of military plants and production units, well away from the fast advancing German troops. For comparison, it took almost two years for the USA, who not even were under an attack, to deploy the industrial infrastructure for war deliveries to Europe under the contracts received ahead of WW2.  Below, a Soviet poster \u201cIf war happens tomorrow\u201d It expresses the spirit of a \u201ctotal war\u201d (as in \u201cWollt ihr den totalen Krieg? Wollt ihr ihn, wenn n\u00f6tig, totaler und radikaler, als wir ihn uns heute \u00fcberhaupt erst vorstellen k\u00f6nnen?\u201d) that permeated not only the military planning, but other central aspects of Stalinist society. The Soviet mobpl\u00e1ns (\u201cmobilization plans\u201d) always pertained to the most protected state secrets. Enough to say, there remained close to none photographs of equipment being relocated east in 1941\u201342 (here\u2019s one). If you were found with a camera in a vicinity of a railway station back then, you would face an immediate arrest with a very harsh interrogation to follow. Still, \u201ceveryone\u201d in the USSR knew for certain that for example our plants producing cigarettes and pasta could switch to making rifle rounds on a dime. (As a matter of fact, they couldn\u2019t. Yet, some of the equipment could be repossessed for war production indeed. And as a matter of fact, our tractor plants were designed with production capacity 100% adaptable to making tanks).  ",

            "answer_text": "It does in a time of crisis or time when decisions need to be made quickly. It can devote society\u2019s resources to a single goal and ensure that that goal is just about everyone\u2019s goal. Less time and effort are dedicated to \u201cnon-essential\u201d activities. The Soviet Union put a satellite into earth orbit before the U.S. did because of a single-minded effort to do so, dictated and enforced from the top. While Russian leadership was driving towards a specific goal with laser-like focus, the U.S. was making cars, refrigerators and suburban subdivisions. There was zero leadership interest in making satellites - the U.S. allowed the Army and Navy compete for the honor of being the second people to put a satellite into orbit. In fact, the Navy had been given the go-ahead and the Army was not given first shot. Navy liquid-fueled rockets blew up spectacularly on the launching pad, or malfunctioned equally spectacularly a few seconds into flight. The Army\u2019s solid fuel rocket finally launched the second man-made satellite into space, and the Russians won the satellite race. They also won the race to orbit a man in space, and followed up by putting the world\u2019s first woman into space. But the U.S. landed men on the moon and the Russians were never really in that race as successfully as the Americans. Why? Because when a market-oriented multi-polar society decides on a single goal - land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth - it can do things rapidly and flexibly. I noted that another poster sang the glories of centrally planning what people want, without figuring out just how you determine what they want. Usually it ends up being what the planners want for the people, and screw what the people might actually want. Case in point: in the old Soviet Union, birth control pills and devices were not in the planners\u2019 vision of what Soviet women needed. So when Irina was pregnant and didn\u2019t want to deliver little Svetlana, she had to go to a state abortion clinic. That was her birth control option. As a result, Russian abortion rates were significantly higher than rates in the rest of Europe. BTW - Russian had been struggling with low birth rates for a long time. Repeated abortions can make a woman infertile - a bad thing if you want to boost population. D\u2019oh! After the fall of the Soviet Union, birth control pills and other contraceptive methods became available because of consumer choice. Russian abortion rates declined to match those of the rest of Europe. Irina, it seems, didn\u2019t want to abort Svetlana; she wanted never to conceive her. But centralized planning is absolutely the best. Screw Irina. The state knows better. ",
