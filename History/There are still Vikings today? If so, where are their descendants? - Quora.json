            "answer_text": "The term \u201cViking\u201d truly only refer to those Scandinavians who engaged in acts of piracy and low-level warfare in the late Iron Age (c. 750\u20131100). Only a minority of the Scandinavian peoples of this epoch, the \u201cNorsemen\u201d as they are called, ever engaged in such acts/ lifestyle. The Viking military/ sociologic phenomenon possibly arose from a power vacuum created by the pacification by the sword of the Saxons and the Frisians in the 8th century. At least in the West, there were no more buccaneers roaming the seas: all the territory between Scotland and Italy belonged to the same sphere of influence. Then, some Norsemen decided that there might be some easy coin to be made and started building boats and organizing into war-bands. They were the Vikings. Throughout the Viking Age, the size and organization of such raiding parties changed drastically. Soon these bands were not just small crews attacking isolated monasteries, but enormous armies, led by powerful so-called \u201csea-kings\u201d who threatened entire kingdoms. Then, at the end of the Viking Age, the Scandinavians had organized themselves in centralized states and only really ever warred for their kings. Following this development, and their conversion to christianity, the Scandinavian Norsemen became fully integrated into what was then called \u201cchristendom,\u201d the civilizational yardstick and loose alliance-system of the time. The Viking phenomena thus endured for about three centuries and evolved, before really morphing into something completely different. the \u201cVikings\u201d now were actual soldiers, and the \u201cNorsemen,\u201d while still culturally close, were more and more seen and identified as \u201cNorwegians,\u201d \u201cSwedes\u201d and \u201cDanes.\u201d However, if we really just focus on the military aspect of the Viking phenomena, i.e., the \u201cViking Raid,\u201d it actually survived for a much longer time in one specific area: North-Norway. There, the local rulers had to face the growing influence of the Russian state of Novgorod and both attempted to claim and control the large swath of land situated between them in Northern Fenno-Scandinavia: Finnm\u00f6rk. However, he inhabitants of Finnm\u00f6rk, the S\u00e1mi, were not themselves as concerned by this conflicts and mostly just paid their taxes to however came to their villages that year. As such, Novgorod and North-Norway had to bring the fight directly to each other\u2019s territory. Each power started sending sea-borne raiding parties to pillage, kill and burn the holding of their opponents while extending their influence and territory. Sounds pretty Viking to me! These raids actually lasted a long, long time. The last ones took actually place in the 14th century! About three centuries after the most-commonly accepted date of the end of the Viking Age (1066: death of Harald Hardrada). While such raids were definitely not born out of a similar socio-political context as the \u201coriginal\u201d Viking raids, they definitely did resemble them in the form they took. However, these attacks definitively ceased in the early 15th century and nothing quite similar has ever happened since so no, there are no more Vikings. But as far as their descendants\u2026probably just about everyone in Scandinavia, the British isles, France, Benelux, Poland, the lands around the Baltic and the Eastern Slavic countries can statistically claim to have some Viking ancestor while only a handful of actual familly records (most tied to either Iceland or the Kings of mainland Scandinavia) actually \u201cprove\u201d such a descent. That\u2019s all I can say for now. Hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "In general, we refer to the Vikings as to seafaring raiders and pirates of the Nordic origin, though contemporary West European sources called them the Norsemen usually. Their early raids out of Scandinavia were to the eastern part of the Baltic Sea where various non-Slavic tribes lived: Prusses, Curonians, Semigalians, Latgalians, Livonians, Ests, Emi, Sumi, Karelians, etc. Those raids were undertaken throughout the 8th century.  However those tribes were poor farmers and the raids were hardly worth the effort sometimes. The Vikings aimed further. They found rich lands to the south of Ladoga Lake along the trade route to Byzantine (the Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks). Those lands were populated by numerous Slavic tribes who fought each other for territory and spoils. They called the Norsemen coming to their land the Varyags. After settling in Old Ladoga (Staraya Ladoga) in a not so peaceful way, the Vikings realised they cannot conquer the entire huge land down to the Black Sea. The locals also realised it\u2019s better to make peace with those warlike foreigners. They established a centralised state in Novgorod (later in Polotsk, Kiev and other towns) with a knyaz as a head of state. His power was enforced by a full time professional guard called the druzhina. The locals paid taxes and duties to a knyaz for protection, justice, etc. It was more profitable for the Vikings to rule this way rather than pillage the territories from time to time. They also used these territories as supply bases to raid even richer lands of the Byzantine Empire (where they were referred to as the Varangians), the Khazar Kaganate, Volga Bulgaria and the Abbasid Khaliphate. The Khazar Kaganate was defeated by Grand Knyaz Svyatoslav Igorevich (Sveinald Ingvarsson). As the time flew, locals started to serve in druzhina together with the Norsemen, though even in the 10th century there were strong ties between the Kievan Rus and Scandinavia. The last historical raid of the Scandinavian Vikings on the Kievan Rus was in 1240 (the Battle of the Neva) which failed as the invaders were forced to return without any plunder. The Vikings intermarried and mixed with the local population by the middle of the 11th century. It may be suggested than many modern Russians, Belorussians and Ukrainians have some Viking ancestry. Thor Heyerdahl and some others assumed the Cossacks were the Viking descendants as they never considered themselves Russians or Ukrainians. However they plundered many coastal towns of the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate in the 16th century using their fast chaika boats.  (a Cossack chaika chasing an Ottoman galley) The Viking activities in the West were different to some extent. They pillaged the monastery of Lindisfarena in 793 which was only the beginning of their invasion to England which was dominated by descendants of the Saxons, Angles and Jutes. Although one must note they conquered England for themselves just 2 centuries ago or so. Their homeland was modern Denmark and north western Germany.  Saxon pirates plagued England when it was under the Roman rule. When the Romans withdrew their legions from Britannia to protect what was left of their empire, the Germanic invaders landed and pushed the Britons away into South Scotland (Strathclyde and Galloway), Wales and Cornwall. They established 7 kingdoms (Kent, Sussex, Essex, Wessex, East Anglia, Mercia, Northumbria). Mercia was the strongest one, though Wessex rose to power by the time of Viking arrival. It subdued Kent, Sussex and Essex. The Vikings raided the coasts, but never wintered. When the Vikings decided they could settle in England, a large force landed in 865 called the Great Heathen Army under command of Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, sons of legendary Ragnar Lodbrok by Aslaug. Other Viking jarls joined later and they conquered roughly a half of England establishing the Danelaw there. The Saxons praying Jesus Christ were definitely not stronger than ones following Wodan a couple hundred years back\u2026  Many Vikings left England after 878 to pursue their fortune in the mainland Europe when Charles the Bald died and the West Frankish Kingdom was in turmoil. Wessex recovered most of the Danelaw in the early 10th century, though the Danes came again in 1016 under command of Cnut the Great, defeated it and merged entire England except Cornwall into their kingdom of Denmark and Norway. The kingdom started to fall apart after his death in 1035. Edward the Confessor is considered to be the last Anglo-Saxon King of England ruling from 1042 to 1066. Harold Godwinson was elected by the Witenagemot as his successor. He managed to defeat and kill Harold Hardrada, King of Norway, another claimant to the English throne, in the Battle of Stamford Bridge, though lost himself to William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, in the Battle of Hastings. Although the last Viking king was Magnus Barefoot probably, but his conquests were aimed at Ireland, the Shetlands, the Orkneys and the Isle of Man mostly. Here ends the history of Anglo-Saxon and Viking England. There are estimates of up to 30% of the British people to have descended from the Vikings depending on geographical location. The highest percentage is for the Shetlands, the Orkneys and Caithness. It\u2019s lower considerably for the Hebrides and the Isle of Man. The lowest percentage is for Ireland, Wales and Cornwall. A million Vikings still live among us  However keep in mind the research above focuses on Norwegian markers in Y-DNA. The Danes were more related genetically to the Saxons, they settled in England for much longer and in larger numbers, therefore their contribution to British ancestry should be much higher. ",
