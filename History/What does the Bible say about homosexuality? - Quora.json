            "answer_text": "The Biblical stance is that all physical intimacy outside the bonds of Christian marriage is sinful. Most people stop reading right there, because their minds are already made up what to believe\u2014but if you\u2019ll allow me, let me also say a little more. If God is the Creator of life, and thus of human relationships, is it unreasonable that God should establish the boundaries for such things? Would it be reasonable of us to expect God to create sex, a wonderful and pleasurable gift, and then allow us to contort and pervert it in any way we see fit? The Bible makes the case that marriage is something God instituted as a symbol (a \u201ctype\u201d in theological terminology) of God\u2019s relationship with mankind. In the Book of Revelation and elsewhere in the New Testament, the Church is envisioned as the Bride of Christ, made holy by Jesus\u2019 sacrifice, and ready to be joined to Christ for eternity. Jesus is the Bridegroom, faithfully loving God\u2019s people, even in their disobedience and rebellion because they are redeemed by His sacrifice. Throughout Scripture, images of sexuality are used to depict holiness and righteousness versus corruption and sin. When a man and woman take each other as partners for this lifetime, their relationship is a witness about Christ and the Church. God intends for us to be in permanent, committed relationships where we love one another sacrificially, giving what it takes for the other\u2019s good and even dying for one another if needed. Marriage means loving the other person even when your mate is difficult, unfaithful, or rebellious. It means always seeking the other person\u2019s good over your own\u2014because that\u2019s what Christ has done for the Church. That said, the Bible nowhere suggests that homosexual adultery is worse than heterosexual adultery\u2026but both condemn a person to destruction apart from redemption by the blood of Christ, and both can be repented of and forgiven and put away as far as east from west if we are saved by faith in Him. The grave error of the modern church is not only believing that homosexual sin is worse in God\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s the failure to see that ALL sin is deadly and will destroy us eternally apart from Jesus\u2019 sacrificial death and the atonement He makes on our behalf.

            "answer_text": "The Bible tells us that homosexuality is a sin. Like any other sin, if we break one commandment it\u2019s the same as any other commandment. So if we lie, steal, cheat, idolize something or someone, covet, kill, hate, or anything else, it is on the same level as homosexuality, as far as God goes. We don\u2019t treat liars or cheaters like we do homosexuals, though, right? People make homosexuality into something WORSE and treat homosexuals like they are lepers and have to be kept outside the city, away from people, lest someone \u201ccatch\u201d homosexuality or something. The dehumanizing treatment of homosexuals and others of the LGBT community by some Christians is horrible. And there are actual people in the LGBT community who believe in God and Jesus Christ. They are Christians. They might be dealing with this issue, and don\u2019t know how to solve it, but they hold on to their faith while they work it out. It is not easy, and the feelings may never go away completely, but some people have managed to live this way. They take their beliefs seriously and Yahshua (Jesus) seriously, and know that their sexual preferences and feelings aren\u2019t going away, so they deal with it and live with it. What else can they do? What the rest of Christianity needs to do is recognize them as human beings, regardless, and not treat them any differently than any other sinner. They are souls that need to be saved, not some animal than must be kept in a cage. I can\u2019t say that the Bible doesn\u2019t rather clearly tell us that homosexuality is a sin, but I do know something about God: He is God, and He knows and understands all, and He is a fair and just judge. Christians should support, fully, the spiritual development of those who are trying to be Christians while identifying as homosexual, bisexual, or any other \u201cparaphilia\u201d. That is what the church is for, and it isn\u2019t their job to like it. It isn\u2019t their job to understand it. They have to see sincere believers who are LGBT as part of them, the church and body of Christ, no matter what their problem. I\u2019ve heard horror stories about this, immediately launching into exorcisms, for example. If a person in the church told a lie, would they do that crazy stuff? If they are not part of the body of Christ, how exactly would a member of the LGBT people WANT to convert, if that was their reception? ",
