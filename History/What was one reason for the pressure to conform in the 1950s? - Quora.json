            "answer_text": "In general, people conform because their is an imperative to succeed that depends on it. In the United States for example, if you worked for a company, you conformed to the corporate dress code because otherwise you would get fired. However, American culture celebrates the \u2018rugged individual\u2019 and \u2018self made person\u2019 and newness, so often non-conformity is looked on positively because they were otherwise successful. America doesn\u2019t celebrate conformity as a default good, so if you mostly followed common societal norms, you didn\u2019t feel any pressure. Compare that with Japan where conformity is seen as a positive in itself, and stepping outside of the norm in even small ways can be viewed as disruptive. For example, an in-law of mine was singled out in a company in the late 1980s as being somewhat disruptive because he grew a mustache. ",
