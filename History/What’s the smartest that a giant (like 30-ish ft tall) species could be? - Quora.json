            "answer_text": "Their leg bones would have to be the size of bridge pillions to support such a tall creature. Osteologists declare that the modern elephant is the largest land animal possible - based on calculations of limits on weight bearing bones.

While super intelligent trees may not be able to evolve due to energy constraints, I don't see how being big constrains intelligence. It does constrain body plan, however ",
