            "answer_text": "A famous political scientist named David Easton once defined politics as \u201cthe authoritative allocation of values for society.\u201d The implication is that politics is not a socially neutral system: it defines authoritatively what is good and what bad, what is permissible and what punishable, what is valuable and what worthless. It may do this collectively and (more or less) cooperatively in a democratic regime; it may do it with one-sided heavy-handedness is a dictatorial regime; it may step back and allow commerce and market forces to determine values in a laissez faire capitalist regime\u2026 But one way or another, politics is implicit in allocating collective values. Art in every form is an overt expression of values. When a painter paints a field s\u2019he is creating a value for the worth of natural \u2018countryside\u2019 locations. When an actor portrays a hero or a villain s\u2019he is showing us what it means to be good or bad. When a photographer photographs a model s\u2019he is telling us all sort of things about what we should expect of beauty. When a singer sings about h\u2019er broken heart and endless passion, or about cheap sex with drugged-out groupies, that singer is telling us what s\u2019he thinks is right and good and correct for sexual relationships. Every form of art raises values that we are expected to accept or reject as we appreciate the art, and so yes, all art is political. Sometimes it may be crapulent, stupid expressions of politics \u2014 maybe every \u201cgrab the money and f*ck the hos\u201d rap song is the moral equivalent of a Rush Limbaugh or Alex Jones rant \u2014 but it is politics in Easton\u2019s sophisticated sense of the term. There is a lesson here about the value of aesthetics to society and politics that I\u2019m tempted to dive into, but will resist for the moment because I want to reflect on it. Perhaps I\u2019ll come back and expand this post in a few days\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "No, I do not believe that all art is political - not even remotely. And I disagree with almost everything Ted wrote in his answer, including the quotation that he used about politics. The word \u201cpolitics\u201d derives from the Greek, polis, which means city, and it simply means \u201cof the city\u201d, or by extension, \u201cof the state\u201d. All politics means is the organization of government. People put many other definitions on it, because, of course, organizing government takes many forms, and any human organization can get very, very complicated - to say the least. But the word itself is simple. Art, on the other hand, has nothing at all to do with the organization of government. It is an expressive craft, elevated by inspiration to higher levels to a special place in human activity. There are artists who create art with political points of view, but that is a very small group. Most art is one of two things: an artist merely offering up his/her aesthetic expression, or else an effort at communication of that point of view to an audience. Any value judgments that the artist makes about human beings, relationships, beauty, or anything else is theirs alone and is only political if it is a statement the artist intends as such, or\u2026. the viewer receives as political. An artwork has myriad realities, as many as the number of people who view the piece. Every single interpretation is equally valid. Each person brings his own background, his own reality to a work of art. For Ted, and perhaps for other people, all art may indeed be a political statement. For me, and many others, they certainly are not. For me, they are openings to my own inner and very personal reality, and that has nothing to do with the workings of the state or its standards, I can assure you. ",
