            "answer_text": "That is hard to answer, mainly because of his first wife. When she married him she was reasonably pretty, but as she aged she got\u2026not pretty, despite descriptions of her strong supporters who still described her as most beautiful in the world\u2026but others already in 1515 described her as rather ugly than otherwise. Hence even sources from back then are biased!(and hence unreliable), and portraits are not always 100% accurate\u2026not to mention there are often 3\u20134 version of the same portrait done throughout the history, and some originals were definitely lost. And prior to Holbeins, most portraits of Henry\u2019s queens were really unflattering, if not making them ugly\u2026and unrealistic Anne Boleyn(supposedly):  (Though undoubtedly the portrait is of Queen of England-the pendant is one of the jewels of English Queens, it could just as well be any of his wives. The face is not telling, the later style hood could be due to being copy etc\u2026 And overall it is not a very realistic face.) Katherine of Aragon:  (clearly, painter of this one could paint clothes, but not realistic face!) \u2026 But in my opinion, some portraits are usable to make the comparison:   Katherine Parr looks atractive in realistic portraits of hers.  And Katherine Howard also was attractive(though some other portraits of Katherine Howard are not as flattering to her, such as Holbein's portrait that is in Toledo:  which I am not very sure is actually her\u2026but if it is so, then it portraits her from an unfortunate angle and with different shape of the nose.  But there are different versions of the same portrait it coming around. This one you\u2019d say is the same person as the first portrait, but not supposedly same portrait. This first portrait historians are unsure if it is her, but I think it is because it shows remarkably same features as her uncle-Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk.   They have the same V-like face, a rather large nose, the shape of brows, even the eyes look very similar. And in one of the sketches by Jacobus Houbraken, from the National Portrait Gallery in London, even the shape of lips looks very similar to her uncle\u2019s. (maybe bit fuller)  What is more interesting is clear resemblance to this portrait:  Which is Anne Boleyn(Katherine Howard\u2019s cousin, and niece of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk). Possibly the lost original portrait from which many later artists made their copies(not very accurate ones,) Bear in mind this is not an actual portrait, but a print of it(so all colours are dark) And colours very likely faded and changed colours. Because none of later early copies of Hever castle portrait showed her with raven hair\u2026   They show her with red hair or reddish-brown. (Darkening of pigments on older portraits is not common, the best example of this is Queen Isabella, who was blond-reddish/strawberry blond, but many of her portraits show brunette!) So it is quite possible that famous Hever portrait on which it is a bit hard to see: (so I added this one): Anne\u2019s hair doesn\u2019t seem raven, but bit reddish\u2026   But you can hardly see it anymore, hence originally that same portrait might have looked like this:  And then the resemblance between Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard would be huge! And certain attractiveness is there. Bear in mind that at that time no word for auburn existed at the time, so dark redhair could be described as just dark (which probably happened in Anne\u2019s case(and rumours of her having dark hair(catholic propaganda defaming-black of hair=of bad character), were later spread wider because her portraits have darkened over the age\u2026) While hair that was for example strawberry blond could be described as gold-red hair, but also as red-gold hair. Which is extremely confusing for a modern reader, and many even I\u2019d say very credible writers and people who really genuinely want to inform their readers with most accuracy\u2026they overlook this little detail, that language at that time, might have not been as precise as today. And they take it too literally. And that is what I think has happened with Katherine of Aragon. The historic report says red-gold hair, but I think nowadays those same people would describe her as gold-red hair or blond-red hair. I don\u2019t think at all that she would have auburn hair, in a modern sense. Because of her portraits, I think she was strawberry blond, darker shade of it: Because this shade:  Is way more accurate then auburn hair they dyed the actress in Spanish Princess. (Spanish Princess got it wrong because they used as source portrait with discoloured varnish, which made Katherine\u2019s hair look way redder than it actually was. And there is lots of photoshopped versions of Katherine\u2019s portraits online.) While evidence would suggest most of Henry VIII\u2019s wives were auburn, Katherine was more strawberry blond than auburn and rather pretty when young:  (If you look at an unrestored version of it, her hair are not nearly so red, which I find very odd. Hope they didn\u2019t screw up the restoration.) Unrestored original:  Michael Sittows portraits of Katherine:  There is the second one from Sittow-Mary with child(or Virgin with a child), but I couldn\u2019t find any discolored version of it, only brightened ones that seem very clearly as they been photoshoped or badly restored. But actually the answer is simple. Look at the one which shows Katherine as Mary Magdalene and this one:  The second portrait clearly has still a lot of discoloured varnish upon it-hence the skin of Katherine is much darker. It probably distorts her hair colour too. There is slight yellowish tint to entire varnish(and when you look at videos of varnish being removed, it might surprise you how big the difference might be before and after, even though it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case on first glance.). It could be also the case that strawberry blond hair under different light might seem one day more to blond, but one day more to red. But it still seems to me like Katherine\u2019s hair was more towards dark golden colour. These two religious portraits are probably from 1503\u20131504, ordered by Queen Isabella to promote her daughter as virgin to negotiations with English court for her betrothal to prince Harry(future Henry VIII). (Don\u2019t believe rumours that it isn\u2019t her. It looks so much like Princess Mary when she was a teenager! And features are the same as in most of Katherine\u2019s other portraits. The angle is just different\u2026) The originals when not restored also don\u2019t at all appear to be showing Katherine as redhaired. Could be due to discoloured varnish, but it seems to me like she wasn\u2019t auburn. Shiny light brown? Shiny strawberry blond? Could be.  So Katherine as a young girl/woman was plump and pretty. Sadly she didn\u2019t stay that way: (irregular eating, with strict fasting for 2 days a week, resulted in her gaining weight really fast once she became Queen and had rich diet.)  (copy of lost original, but made by Wenceslaus Hollar, who was noted for his accuracy and eye for detail\u2026probably most realistic copy of all Tudor portraits)  Katherine really didn\u2019t age well. (around 1525)And if you think this one is bad\u2026  (yes, this is actually her! She wears same dress as in her monkey portrait, so this was probably miniature made from it-but in her lifetime! Though miniatures could often be more unflattering\u2026Still it kind of points to her losing her good looks.)  While this one (made based on full-length portrait/or half-length portrait) is already a later copy. It shows the Tudor gable hood with veil pinned-which is of later style than Katherine would use in the 1530s(she was out of favour by then and didn\u2019t have portraits made), while white bits being so long is something we see only in 1520s\u2026) and the author clearly didn\u2019t understand that what she has around the neck is not lace or piece of embroidered fabric, but necklace!) \u2026 Jane Seymor was plain, but not ugly. Notice the newer style of Tudor gable hood, where black fabric is pinned to one side and white bits are considerably shorter than in the 1520s.  And Anne of Cleves was also very plain:  But it is possible her nose was more profound(but nose of every of Henry VIII\u2019s wives was profound).  \u2026 So to finally answer your question: Most beautiful of wives of Henry VIII in my opinion were: Katherine Parr and Katherine Howard,then Anne Boleyn,then Katherine of Aragon (in her youth, not in as she aged\u2026),then Jane Seymour and Anne of Cleves.But be free to have your own list, beauty is subjective.

            "answer_text": "Strictly based on their portraits (which really is the only yardstick we have), my choice is rather ironic \u2014 because she was the one Henry almost immediately dumped because he thought she was ugly (and smelly). Yup. Anne of Cleves.[1]  OK, I\u2019m on my second German wife, so I might be a little biased. (For the record, she smells nice.) Anne actually didn\u2019t do too badly by Henry, believe it or not. Somewhat oddly, he took a shine to her after all and seems to have regretted his shabby treatment of her. So he referred to her as his \u201csister\u201d and showered her with a palace and a generous pension. They even met fairly often and became (platonically) close. So not only do I think she\u2019s the prettiest one, she also arguably got the best deal from Henry and very astutely kept out of politics \u2014 managing the feat of staying on the good side of Henry, Edward VI, and Mary I, in spite of the constantly changing political winds. So she wasn\u2019t just pretty, she must have been pretty clever, too, making the most out of a really terrible situation for herself. \u2014 UPDATE I wrote the following in the comments, but thought it was a good addition to the post: My guess is that the portrait itself was quite accurate. But what put Henry off was her smell (who knows?) and her Protestant prudishness. She reacted badly to Henry\u2019s attempt to woo her (which frankly isn\u2019t surprising given the description) and Henry wasn\u2019t used to being rejected. Even the smell thing has a plausible explanation on two levels. First, it may well be that she didn\u2019t bathe as often as was normal for the English court (and for that matter Henry caught her unawares and fresh from a journey). But there is another element: It\u2019s been demonstrated that we (subconsciously) select our partners at least in part by smell, and if you perceive their smell as pleasant, then your immune systems are particularly compatible and better for reproduction. Experiments have been performed using sweaty T-shirts and blood tests that confirm the hypothesis. It works both ways, too. So Henry and Anne may simply have been culturally and genetically incompatible. Footnotes[1] Anne of Cleves - Wikipedia",
