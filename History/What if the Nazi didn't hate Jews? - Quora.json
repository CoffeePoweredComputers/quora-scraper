            "answer_text": "If the Nazis weren\u2019t anti-semitic but every other aspect of them remained the same, then it would not have made any significant difference to the outcome of the war. With Hitler\u2019s sense of hubris and hatred of communism, even without his belief of Bolshevist links with world Jewry, he would still have invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 in pursuit of \u201cLebensraum\u201d. German Jews accounted for less than 1% of Germany\u2019s population, totaling some 600,000, and the number of Jewish men available who would\u2019ve been conscripted or joined the German armed forces would have been statistically insignificant in terms of victory. Even without the resources and manpower diverted to the Holocaust, with a Soviet Union fully mobilized, Germany would still have ultimately faced defeat by Russia based on shear numbers and lack of resources, and even without it\u2019s genocidal policies, would also have been viewed as a threat to western democracies, who would have combined to stop it.
