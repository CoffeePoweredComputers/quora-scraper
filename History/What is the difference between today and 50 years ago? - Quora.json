            "answer_text": "There is a lot difference between today and 50 years ago! Listing some of them here:- Women's condition:- The women have changed a lot. Women used to work as 'housewives' and nothing more than that. They only used to cook and take care of their children. Condition has changed a lot. Women now work in offices, they are allowed to vote and their vote is equal to that of men's. Women now can marry whoever they want, they weren't allowed back then to do so. Many jobs are also reserved for them.Technology:- Technology has definitely changed a lot. There were no smartphones back then and now we can't live without smartphones. Computers weren't there but if they were there, they were very big. There were no refrigerators back then. Media was very slow back then. There is more to come.Fashion choices:- Everyone knows how fashion has changed. Women now can wear whatever they want(if they want to). The dresses that women used to wear before looked like Vincent dresses(let me know, if you know the name). Men used to wear clothes like hippie dresses.Growth in addictions (Quora is a addiction for many of us here).",

            "answer_text": "Human rights. 50 years ago women had a lot less rights compared to men. Environment. 50 years ago the air and water was terribly polluted compared to now. Peace. Never have there been as little conflict in the world as today. Besides the normal wars all over the world there was also the looming threat of the Cold War. Poverty. Poverty was much worse and much more common 50 years ago in all countries. We\u2019ve come a long way since then and poverty rates are still going down. Education. Education is a lot more accessible to all now and there is much more emphasis on critical thinking. Healthcare. We grow older and stay healthier much longer into old age today compared to 50 years thanks to the advances in diagnostics and treatments. Food quality. 50 years ago there were still less laws and quality control regarding food safety, which caused more health problems. The variety of available food is also higher now. Acces to information. 50 years you had information from 1 or 2 tv channels, a few radio channels and the local news paper. If a war was going on on an other continent or if someone was murdered in a town 50 kilometers away you just wouldn\u2019t be aware of it. The variety of opinions and ideas spread slower because there was no internet to acces these. ",
