            "answer_text": "Well, for one, they provided the names of many rivers, lakes, hills and mountains in upstate New York and Northwest Pennsylvania. They were a powerful confederation of tribes that did dominate the area in terms of trade and hunting grounds and their influence stretched from the Hudson river to the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes to as far south as the Chesapeake. During the colonial period, they traded furs, deerskins, bearskins with the French and Huron\u2019s to the north and west and the Colonists to the east. They also did trade grain and other supplies. They were formidable allies of the English and Colonists in the French and Indian Wars and were also a nuisance as allies to the Crown to the newly formed United States in the Revolutionary war. Their raids on the settlers who were on the frontier along the Appalachian Ridge in PA and the Mohawk River Valley in New York, prompted Washington to send a contingent of Troops into their territory under General Sullivan in 1781. They destroyed villages and burned crops and pretty much completed the depletion of the Confederations population and ability to wage war. They were a big feature in the Leather Stocking tales of James Fenimore Cooper ( Last of the Mohicans comes from that set). They have wove themselves through intermarriage and persistence into the fabric of our society and culture. For example, did you know that many of the steelworkers who worked on the steel skeletons of the skyscrapers and bridges in this country were members of tribes from the Confederation, predominantly the Mohawks. They generally inhabited Adirondack and highland regions of New York and seem comfortable with heights. Or they allowed that legend to flourish to get the work. ",
