            "answer_text": "Through intense negotiation and keeping each son satisfied with land.  Genghis Khan and three of his four sons Even during Genghis Khan\u2019s lifetime, there had been signs of tension among two of his sons: Jochi and Chagatai. Jochi felt that he had the right to become the Great Khan because he was the oldest. Chagatai refuted this on the basis that Jochi probably wasn\u2019t Genghis Khan\u2019s son. Jochi\u2019s paternity had always been in doubt. During her capture by the Merkid tribe and before she gave birth to Jochi, Genghis Khan\u2019s wife Borte may have been raped, which is why Chagatai sometimes called Jochi a \u201cMerkid bastard.\u201d Trying to prevent a potential civil war, Genghis Khan summoned his four sons to a kurultai in 1221. He recognized Jochi as his oldest son and wanted the others to do the same. However, Chagatai refused. He knew that he had infuriated his father to point that he would never become his heir, but he could still prevent Jochi from becoming the Great Khan. Eventually, they reached a conclusion. Ogodei, who neither brother particularly hated, would become the Great Khan. Chagatai would rule Transoxiana while Jochi\u2019s family would rule over the section of the empire closest to Europe.* By picking a non-factitious heir and handing out appanages to his remaining sons, Genghis Khan managed to avoid a succession crisis after his death. *It\u2019s also worth noting that Jochi predeceased his father anyway ",

            "answer_text": "BEHIND EVERY GREAT MAN THERE IS A GREAT WOMAN PLUS Chinggis khan appointed his successor 10 years before his death. He explained his choice of succession, divided the territory among his 4 sons. The Mongol Empire fractured into four khanates including the Yuan dynasty, the Golden Horde, the Chagatai Khanate and the Ilkhanate.Not only khan appointed the next khan but Kurultai - Wikipedia voted for it. Chinggis khan never changed his mind, there was no misunderstandings about inheritance of the throne.Violating khan\u2019s order considered to be treachery Chinggis khan officially had 4 queens, Borte, Esugen, Esui, Khulan and they all were involved in government matter. When he was preparing for his invasion to Khwarezmian Empire his third queen Esui told him \u201cMy great lord, your journey will be dangerous, please appoint your successor from your 4 sons born by Borte Khatun\u201d. The khan agreed, he stroke his beard and sat thoughtfully thinking and chose his 3rd son Ogoodei to be 2nd khan of The Great Mongol Empire. Why Ogoodei? He was wise, subtle, stable and logical minded one. If Esui was ambitious and selfish like Cersei Lannister she would have suggested her own son for throne or her favorite step son. Also if Chinggis khan was a cocky man with bad attitude and poor brains he could have ignored his queen\u2019s words or could choose his first born or the youngest one. Mongol queens were servants to their subjects and an empire.  Success of the Mongol empire isn\u2019t not entirely related to the great Khans, Mongol Queens had fair share of contribution to its success. Also Chinggis khan was not always attracted to woman\u2019s beauty but also to her intelligence and morality. 2nd and 3rd queens of Chinggis khan, Esugen and Esui were sisters from Tatar tribe, daughters of nobleman Ih-Chiren. When Chinggis khan invaded Tatar tribe Esugen was brought to him as a bride. She said to khan \u201cMy khan, I might look beautiful and smart but my sister is more beautiful and intelligent than me please ask your warriors find her and bring here\u201d. She saved her sister who was lost during the war and made her a queen. Chinggis khan wanted to behead all Tatars because they poisoned his father and created so much turmoil among Mongol tribes. All Tatars captured were knelt in front him and he was ready to give his command for execution. Queens Esui and Esugen went and joined the Tatars, knelt and said \u201cMy khan if you want to execute them kill us too we are Tatar women\u201d. Both of them saved their own tribe. Later Batu khan\u2019s Tatar-Mongol army invaded The Rus now days Russia and made them subjugate for 260 years. Mongolians often compare man and woman, a couple with the 2 columns of the ger. Two equal columns give stability to the ger structure, create strength and balance. The mentality of equality and respect should not only be within the family but within the country and even an empire. It guarantees success.  ",
