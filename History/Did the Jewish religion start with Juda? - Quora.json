            "answer_text": "Modern scholarship posits that 'Judaism' was formed during the period of 600 BCE to 200 CE, where various previous written texts and oral traditions, transcribed to text, were collated and became the 'accepted holy canon' of the Jews. The myths found in these texts point to an founding 'father', Abraham, and his being told to take 'land' in Canaan for his own and his descendants. This of course the stuff of myths, and unfortunately many through out the ages have bought these myths as factual. As it is, there is archeological evidence that the 'israelites' that inhabited Canaan were polytheistic, and transformed to a monotheistic religous sytem between 1000 BCE and the collating of the strictly monotheistic texts of the Torah, ca 600-500 BCE. The name Judah was used as a tribal name, a name of a region in the mythic 'Reconquest of Canaan', as part of a greater state called Israel, and later in the Greek and Roman empire era a jewish vassal state know as Judea. Much of the Old Testament narrative depicts the Hebrews as being commended by their deity to 'clear the land of its inhabitants' aka genocide, or expulsions, and much of the ills the Hebrews experienced was directly due to their lack of genocide and exclusion. These can be seen as 'reasons why we have a closed group', in later expressions of Judaism. Christianity has vacillated on the point of syncretism, and one of the major charges of the Protestant reformation was that the Catholic Church had included much paganism, and that the Chruch needed to be purified of such elements. Modern 'fundamentalists' often claim the ills that befall the US or the world are a direct result of not 'following god's will', harkening to the calls found in the Old Testament. ",

            "answer_text": "By our tradition and written records (the Torah) \u2018the Jewish religion\u2019 must be said to have started with Abraham. However, the specific legal rulings that make up most of Jewish law came later. These laws, in some degree, codified what was already the practice of the tribes of the sons of Israel (Israel was Abraham\u2019s grandson, also known as Jacob (Yakov). Prior to the national revelation of the law from God to the gathered people at Mount Sinai, the B\u2019nei Israel were a related group of tribes with common ancestry and customs. After the national revelation at Mount Sinai, this group became a Nation. Jews are called \u2018Jews\u2019 (Yehudim) from the Kingdom of Judah, which existed in the middle to southern (from just north of Jerusalem south into the Negev) parts of the Land of Israel. Yehudah (Judah) was one of the sons of Israel (Jacob) and the kings of Judah came from that tribe. The original kingdom was David\u2019s (of the tribe of Judah) but when his son Solomon died, an internal rebellion led to the division of the kingdom into a Northern and Southern separate kingdoms. The Northern Kingdom kept the name \u2018Israel\u2019 and the Southern one was called Judah, since it retained the land area of the tribe of Judah, and retained the rule of a member of the tribe of Judah. Both kingdoms were later conquered by the Assyrians (northern kingdom) and Babylonians (southern kingdom). The kingdoms were then reduced to provinces of the Persian empire, but the Judeans (the citizens of the southern kingdom of Judah) returned from Babylon and rebuilt the city of Jerusalem and the temple (which had been built by Solomon and destroyed by the Babylonians). The province of Judah (or Judea, which is the Greek form) continued as an entity until 165 BCE, when a successful rebellion against Persian rule led to a new kingdom ruled by the Jews, which was called the Hasmonean kingdom of Judah (Judea). This kingdom was eventually taken over by the Roman empire, but the inhabitants of the area continued to periodically rebel, and eventually the Second Temple was also destroyed, this time by Rome, in 70 CE. Another rebellion - this one almost successful - in 135 CE led to the Romans decimating the population and deporting about 1/3 throughout the Mediterranean, the destruction of the entire city of Jerusalem (it was renamed \u2018Aeolia Capitolina\u2019) and Rome renamed the whole area from Judea to Palestina (after the Philistines, who no longer existed) in an attempt to erase \u2018Judeans\u2019 altogether. This did not work, but they tried. But the religion of \u2018one God\u2019 existed from Abraham\u2019s time (probably around 1800 BCE) through the time of the existence of the Temples (First temple roughly 900 to 500 BCE and Second Temple roughly 400 BCE to 70 CE) and continued during the Diaspora (the Roman dispersal of Judeans around the empire) and until now. After the destruction of the Temple, however, much of the practice had to change, because Jewish law specified that all sacrificed had to take place at the Temple. Since the Temple was destroyed, we make charitable donations instead of animal sacrifice. Short answer - the long one is a lot longer! ",
