            "answer_text": "That is a very good question. Not many younger folks are picking up the hobby and I\u2019m not sure why anyone would really. I did many years ago (1970) when I was a boy, sick and at home from school. My Mom kept my occupied by going through a jeroboam of old pennies we had. She and Dad threw any Wheat Pennies, Indian Head pennies or Canadian pennies which they got in change into it. So dutifully sorted them out by year. Mom got me some Whitman folders to put them into and thus a coin collector was born. I don\u2019t know that many Moms and Dads do that with kids these days\u2026there\u2019s a lot more interesting diversions around now. Most coin collectors are my age or older. Many lost interest in the hobby and sold what they had. Some have them sitting in a closet or attic somewhere. Only a small percentage ever stuck with it. I did for a while but lost interest in the 1980s when I went to college. I\u2019d still kept my fingers in the waters, but not like before. The internet has been a blessing and a curse for numismatists (coin collectors). You can find what you\u2019re looking for much more easily now and can sometimes get a good deal. That\u2019s also caused prices to drift down as now you can see what\u2019s available across the globe. I can buy more cheaply now, but that also means what I have is now less valuable. As older collectors part out their collections or die and their heirs sell off their collections it\u2019s also depressing prices further. Without new collectors coming into the hobby it\u2019s shrinking overall and prices with it. Prices may drop to a level where folks decide to get in but I rather doubt it. It\u2019s a bit like record collecting in that respect or other hobbies. I don\u2019t say this to bemoan the times I live in, just acknowledging things as they are. All things must pass and if you live long enough you see it happen. ",

            "answer_text": "As has already been said, there seems to be fewer young(er) people collecting coins these days than once was the case. In my view, this is, at least in part, due to the fairly characterless coinage we now use here in the U.K. I began coin collecting almost incidentally: in 1971 the U.K ended the \u00a3SD system and introduced a decimal coinage. The reasons for abandoning the \u00a3SD all make perfect sense: calculations are so much easier and conversions into and comparisons with other currencies became a great deal more straightforward. BUT! What a wonderfully eccentric and history laden system we lost. The Pound Sterling (\u00a3 = Libra) was composed of 20 Shillings (S = Solidus) each shilling was worth 12 pennies (D = Denarius.) This meant that a \u00a3 was comprised of 240 pennies or eight halfcrowns or four crowns or ten florins or 40 tanners or . . . you get the picture. Then,of course, not every coin bore the head of the present Queen - as do modern coins - in any pocketful of coins there might have been portraits of George VI or V or Edward VII or even, and not unusually, Queen Victoria. Not only did each coin represent a different value to each generation whoes hands they passed through they also represent a comprehensible allusion to the lives of each and every person in the chain of ownership. I initially saught to collect some examples of the Old coins as little more than a record of \u2018Times gone by\u2019 . . But now . . . Some of my coins are quite valuable! You might recognise from the foregoing that I much prefer coins that have been in general circulation rather than the somewhat bland and Lifeless collectors\u2019 pieces that have been and are still being produced.
