The Benjamin \u201cwolf\u201d Tribe were notorious for being: sex perverts, gang rape murderers, and kidnappers. Saul/Paul of Tarsus was a Benjamite descendant. A \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d, whom Jesus had warned his disciples about: Gospel of Mark chp. 8/Genesis 49 - \u201cBeware the yeast [false teaching] of the [ravenous Benjamite wolf] Pharisees\u201d, \u201cwolves in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d, \u201cwho first devour [the followers of Jesus] in the morning\u201d by severe persecutions, then second \u201cin the evening divide\u201d the followers of Jesus by their Pharisaic yeast/false teaching. Paul was a Benjamite Phariseee, the worst of all possible worlds. The Judah Tribe fought against the sex pervert Benjamin Tribe in a War (Book of Judges chp 19\u201321), and nearly annihilated the Benjamin Tribe, killing all men, women, children, and animals, except for a remnant of 600 men. These kidnapped virgin brides from outside the house of Israel to take as wives because the other 11 Tribes would not give them their daughters as wives. So why would (or how could!!) GOD ALMIGHTY form a seemingly unequally yoked marriage union between Jospeh (Judah Tribe) and the Virgin Mary (Benjamin Tribe), and again with Jesus (Judah Tribe) and Mary of Bethany the Magdalene (Benjamin Tribe)? You tell me. ",

Jacob, mentioned here as Joseph\u2019s father, is really Joseph\u2019s father-in-law. That Jacob is really Mary\u2019s father, therefore she is of the tribe of Judah.

Both came from the line of King David, but they diverged from there. Joseph wasn't involved in the birth of Jesus, but all of their remaining children were in the line of the tribe of Judah, as well, which here in America is almost totally ignored because of the gentile-centrist attitude of the American churches.
