            "answer_text": "I spent two years in Japan, and the relations with Christians is typically reserved.  But then, it is reserved about almost every religion. Houses will typically have a Butsudan with a place of reverence, and perhaps a Chashitsu, or tea-ceremony room, so rituals of prayer and the tea ceremony are important. Shinto shrines and temples are ubiquitous, Christian churches are few. One of my best experiences was going to Tsuwano and having a lecture on church relations by the Catholic priest, who was remarkably ecumenical. They had a lovely retreat house with room for most of us to sleep overnight.   Tsuwano Church: tatami mats, no pews. Since about 1873 and the Meiji restoration,  religious toleration is standard. Only about 1% of Japanese are Christian, but several holidays have become secular days, including St. Valentines, Christmas and many weddings have cultural trappings of Christian weddings, including white dresses, ceremonies at wedding chapels and an exchange of vows. Officially, it is tolerated, and in Western Japan, it's more popular than in Tokyo.  Christianity was brought to southwestern Japan by the Portugese  in 1542, and they brought with it gunpowder and various inventions. Japanese were happy to accept inventions, but were resistant to importing ideas which seemed foreign.  Christianity in Japan However in 1587, in an era of European colonization and Christianization of the nearby Philippines, Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued an edict banning missionaries from the country due to the religion's growing power, intolerant behavior towards Shinto and Buddhism, and involvement in the sale of Japanese people as slaves overseas. In 1597, Hideyoshi proclaimed a more serious banning edict and executed 26 Christians in Nagasaki as a warning. Intent to bring Japan under complete control, the succeeding Tokugawa Shogunate further hardened the country's anti-Christian stance, accusing the religion of obstructing the authorities, antisocial behavior and intolerance towards the established religions. After a rebellion on the Shimabara Peninsula that involved many Christians in the late 1630s, thousands of rebels were executed and a full ban on Christianity became strictly enforced. Only small pockets of Christians, known as the \"Hidden Christians\", continued practicing their religion in secret.  Today, Christians enjoy open worship, acceptance in business and trade, and few obvious restrictions, but it is still considered a Western religion. A typical meeting will have about 30 members, but a few have as many as a hundred or more attending. ",

            "answer_text": "In general, Christians aren't really treated differently here. It can be tricky to explain why we can't participate, or need to have a limited participation, in things on Sundays. A lot of extra-curricular things, community events and meetings, etc. are scheduled on Sunday mornings. That is probably the most inconvenient thing about being Christians in our every day life.   When a Japanese person decides to become a Christian when his/her family of origin is not Christian things can get anywhere from a bit uncomfortable to downright ugly and painful. It is especially hard when the person converting is an only or eldest son or is a woman married to an only or eldest son. This was the case for my husband, since he is an only son, and it was very difficult for him at first. His family was extremely unhappy. They have come to tolerate it over time, but it can still cause tensions.  On the flip side, Japanese churches can be very tight knit and supportive. Our Catholic parish is wonderful, and like a family to us.  ",
