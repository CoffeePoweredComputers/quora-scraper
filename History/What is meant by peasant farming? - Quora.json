            "answer_text": "Peasant farming refers to a type of small scale agriculture. Peasant farmers grow crops and often rear some livestock on a small scale. Some of the produce is used to feed the family and the surplus is sold. The farmer and family members provide most of the labour. Most of the land is used for growing crops. Peasant farmers grow a variety of crops including tomatoes, cabbages, peppers, ginger, yams, legumes and rice. Crop rotation is usually practiced. For instance, small farmers often rotate legumes with peppers or vegetable crops. Peasant farmers often rear some livestock including chickens, ducks and other small animals. Farming is done using mostly labour intensive methods and traditional hand tools. Several irrigation channels or canals are used to supply crops with water. Manure and compost are used as fertilizers. www.agricincome.com ",
