            "answer_text": "Lenin did advocate for democracy. It is one of the many misunderstandings that people have about Lenin and Marxism. Marxism is not undemocratic at all, its actually a bottom-up ideology that focuses on people power over authority and oppression. We in the West are conditioned to believe that democracy must follow our own model, liberal democracy. In the USSR, they had soviet democracy. Soviet democracy was a system of elected councils (soviets) on local, municipal, regional, and national levels. Local concerns would be addressed by local representatives whilst the regional and national representatives could debate national concerns. Lenin intended the democracy to be representative of the entire working-class and therefore he wanted to ensure that members of the proletariat could be elected, as opposed to some who believed in a technocracy. He believed that the democratic process should not be restricted to those of a particular class or intelligentsia because it would be undemocratic. The democracy evolved into a dictatorship after Stalin ceased elections and ruthlessly took power in the party by murdering his opponents. ",

            "answer_text": "The question shows a total lack of understanding, Lenin was no Democrat or Marxist, from what I've read of Lenin the bits that make sense seem to be Marx rewritten by Lenin, most of the rest seem to be Lenin in wait to grab power,check out Lenin Collected Works V.I.Lenin Library : Marx was a democrat hence he was the one who called for' the workers of the world to unite' (after all they are the overwhelming majority) and the emancipation of the working classes must be carried out by the working class, no leaders in other words,something Lenin either chose to ignore or couldn't comprehend the former more likely he wasn't stupid. Democracy is nothing more than people power, not a minority of people wielding power, and for a truly democratic society to be established the workers of the world have to understand and want a democratic society, for more info on Marx and Democracy visit www.worldsocialism.org regards ian.
