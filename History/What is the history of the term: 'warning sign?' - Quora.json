            "answer_text": "Sometimes the most puzzling aspect of Quora questions is that they have made it onto Quora at all. There is a good online etymological dictionary at Online Etymology Dictionary, which you might find helpful. Your main difficulty will be that there is no 'term' \"warning sign\". It is not a phrase or saying, any more than \"blue hat\" or \"my dog\". They are just a couple of words that mean what they say. ",
