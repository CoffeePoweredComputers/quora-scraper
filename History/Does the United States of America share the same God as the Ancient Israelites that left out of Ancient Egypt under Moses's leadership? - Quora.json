            "answer_text": "No. Absolutely not and without any doubt. The Supreme Deity of Israel as described in detail in the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures has a single Name not shared by any other deity in any pantheon of gods in any other religion. This name was written nearly 7,000 times in the Hebrew Scriptures and it was not Jesus or God. Jesus is the Straw Man transliterated name of a Torah teacher and Messiah from Israel that was actually named Yehoshua. Jesus is not the same as the Messiah described in the Greek Scriptures since Christianity has twisted His teachings and created doctrines that nullify the words Yehoshua actually spoke, thus creating \u201ca different Yehoshua\u201d than the one his apostles preached. (2 Corinthians 11:4) \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05b9\u05d4 the Name of the Hebrew Deity, is absolutely not the deity of America, as no Christian church (outside the Jehovah's Witnesses) proclaims Him to be. Instead, they proclaim the Canaanite/Babylonian deity of fortune known as God to be their deity of choice. The proof of this is in their currency, \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d Likewise, the pledge of indoctrination forced upon their children daily claims they are a \u201cNation under God.\u201d The fact that America worships fortune and praises its deity over all else is precisely why the Bible fortells its destruction in over 200 verses. Of course, you would have to read it to discover this, which is something almost no Americans actually do. ",

            "answer_text": "In theory yes. But Athanasius of Alexandria made a leap of logic that there are 3 \u201cpersons\u201d within Ol' Abe's God (eternal Father, Son & Holy Ghost). This is the basic tenet of Nicene Creed Christianity or the catholic/universal Church since 325. The 451 Council of Chalcedon also reached a consensus among clerics that the Son was both God & Man. This became the official religion of the Roman Empire in 380. The former subjects of the Kingdom of Judea were granted an exemption. Some emperor mandated that the bishops of Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem & Alexandria were equal in matters of doctrine. Arius of Alexandria used to have a huge following (eternal Father & Holy Ghost but not the Son). But diplomatic & military pressure from the Frankish Empire imposed Nicene Christianity on them. The Church of Jesus Christ & the Latter Day Saints, Judaism & Islam believe in the Oneness of God. Although the Protestant Reformation broke with the Bishop of Rome. They weren't given Autocephaly - Wikipedia status by the other 4 Patriarchies as requested. There were some doctrinal differences that did not make them kosher. If they recite the Nicene Creed & follow the edicts of Franciscus Bishop of Rome (2013AD- now). Then they are Roman Catholic (big C). If they recite the Nicene Creed during liturgies then they are catholic (small c). If they believe in the divinity of Christ (aka Jesus son of Joseph the carpenter of Nazareth) then they are Christian (with a big c). ",
