            "answer_text": "NOPE! I don\u2019t care about deforestation and going outdoors increases my chances of a football and thunder striking my thick skull. Herschel Beahm IV going to the mountains with no toilets and electricity? kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk In 11th grade, there was an extra credit assignment around transcendentalism to go experience nature without talking and electronics. I used this as an excuse to go to some park I have no memory of visiting when I was a young boy who cried when dogs barked at him but was told I\u2019ve been there before. In many romance anime, I\u2019ve seen promises for marriage being made as kids such as in Nisekoi, so maybe I promised that to a girl 10+ years ago (or a boy because I\u2019ve been gay from day 1), hit my head and lost my memories, and she\u2019s going to appear someday? I photographed squirrels, which were a rare sight to me because of how infrequently I went outside, and had the film processed. I didn\u2019t turn in the assignment and failed the class, but it is a memory I am fond of. No idea where the pictures are. Same goes for pictures of me in my childhood, they should\u2019ve been in a wooden square chest but somehow the inside was vacant when I unlocked it years later with a key. There\u2019s a guy who lock picks, and I suspect him in spite of the blame being pinned on someone else, but there\u2019s no substantial evidence for either and frankly I don\u2019t care who did it and have let go of a lot of things and shifted my focus to other things long, long ago. I realized the importance of nature last year around the time I danced around campfires in Shyllien Nature Reserve with Healia and talked two people into planting trees with me at a college library and haven\u2019t visited the campus since. One guy was into mushrooms and the other one I thought was a dude but turns out was a dudette. Will also mention the crossdressing TA from astronomy class, thought I was in the wrong bathroom when I saw him. I\u2019ve been to the women\u2019s restroom at midnight when I stayed overnight without permission at the life insurance office and it\u2019s way cleaner, so now I know how to spot the differences should I ever somehow step foot in the opposite-gender bathroom, which I won\u2019t, but you never know. I inspect the signs carefully, but someone could prank me and swap signs. As prankproof as I am, jumping as I autorun and using activating byakugan in the streets, it doesn\u2019t hurt to know that a \u2640Meowstic has HA Competitive and \u2642Meowstic has HA Prankster. Oww. I would like a better internet connection and a space where I can be Tarzan.I\u2019m thinking of UNABOM. He was wrong; human freedom and dignity has improved, not eroded. Extreme violence is unnecessary to attract attention, if you want attention, just write correct-sounding things like this maniac here who acts like Quora is his personal soapbox. ",

            "answer_text": "During the 19th century there were repeated Cholera and Yellow Fever epidemics in US cities. Thus Frederick Law Olmsted (1822 \u20131903) as an urban landscape planner demonstrated best the necessity of outdoor natural areas. One of his design principles was \u201cPlanning or designs so that they promote both the physical and mental health of users.\u201d[1] Without a routine, recurrent, and respectful use of outdoor recreation the human body and spirit shrink to the perishing point. But Olmsted described it well, after all he suggested Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Groves of big trees be set aside and created parks across the nation.  Famed for his park designs, Central Park in New York City shown above is Olmsted\u2019s inestimable legacy to the nation\u2019s largest city. \u201cOlmsted had great faith in the ability of his landscape art to improve society and in particular to promote a sense of community in the rapidly growing urban centers of the country. His great parks and park systems were to be spaces held in common by all residents of their cities, places where all classes could mingle, free from the competitiveness and antagonisms of workaday life. His plans for residential suburbs, too, provided common ground that would foster both physical health and what he called \u201ccommunitiveness\u201d\u2014the impulse to serve the needs of one\u2019s fellow citizens. In addition, Olmsted believed that scenery could have a powerful, restorative influence. He was convinced that the spacious, gracefully modulated terrain of his parks provided a specific medical antidote to the artificiality, noise and stress of city life. In this and many other ways he strove to use his skill as an artist to meet the most fundamental of human needs in a comprehensive way. The psychological power of scenery, he felt, could be achieved in landscape design only through subordination of all elements to the creation of a single effect.\u201d  He create places in parks with a conscious effort to express a \"considerable complexity of light and shadow near the eye\" or \"obscurity of detail further away.\" The Olmsted Firm-An Introduction \u201cFrom Buffalo to Louisville, Atlanta to Seattle, Baltimore to Los Angeles, the Olmsteds\u2019 work reflects a vision of American communities and American society still relevant today\u2014a commitment to visually compelling and accessible green space that restores and nurtures the body and spirit of all people, regardless of their economic circumstances. The Olmsteds believed in the restorative value of landscape and that parks can bring social improvement by promoting a greater sense of community and providing recreational opportunities, especially in urban environments.\u201c About the Olmsted Legacy Papers of Frederick Law Olmsted Olmsted to Charles Loring Brace, Brookline, March 7, 1882, The Papers of Frederick Law Olmsted, Volume VII, Parks, Politics, and Patronage 1874\u20131882, eds.

            "answer_text": "How has the events of 2020 with Covid-19 and lockdowns made you realise the importance of nature and a connection with the outdoors? Let\u2019s start by saying that I grew up with nature. I was raised to fish, hunt, camp, garden and keep in touch with nature. When I decided my spiritual path I chose Wicca - among other reasons, because I have an affinity for nature, and the Pagan way has kept me in tune with the planet for over 50 years. I cared about Mother Earth long before it was fashionable. Nowadays they call it \u2018woke\u2019. I guess I\u2019ve never been \u2018asleep\u2019. Ok, now as for the \u2018year in review\u2019, having to stay inside because of the lockdown has been hard on me and a lot of the people I know. This was the first year in my life since I was 5 yrs old that I haven\u2019t gone camping or swimming. I believe that the lockdown has hurt nature lovers a lot more than it has couch potatoes, but I\u2019m hoping that they also have been affected to the point that they don\u2019t ever want to see it happen again. All of us have lost people we loved. Therefore the next time something like this comes along (and it will) everyone needs to insist on immediate action from the powers on high to combat it. As long as I\u2019m pontificating, one more thing. What\u2019s even worse to me is the irrepairable damage done to the environment by the wildfires that are raging all over the planet. We\u2019ve lost so many life-giving, oxygen-giving trees, from Australia to the Amazon jungle to the west coast of the US, that it will literally take a hundred years to replace. We\u2019re going to need to breathe long before then. We\u2019ve been raping mother earth for about 150 years now. It only took her ONE to start paying us back. And payback is a motherfrucker. \u201cIt not nice to fool Mother Nature.\u201d \ud83d\udc80 ",

Not for me, as I was already I think well connected. I retired some years ago to a small rural acreage. I go for a walk, run or bicycle ride through the (relatively) unpolluted country air most mornings and reflect how blessed I am. It has for others, judging by local real estate activity. Many are interested in getting out of the city. But this is also I imagine because of the increased opportunities to work from home and the increased awareness of it and its advantages. It is likely that as a result, more offices are going to work on a \u201chot desk\u201d model where employees do not have dedicated workspaces at the company premises, with the many savings this brings. (It may be a bad time to be the landlord of these office spaces.) As others have said, the more profound impacts are interpersonal. See my page worth a read whoever wrote it. Perhaps this may even reduce the priority on nature and the environment, by increasing the emphasis on these other priorities. But hopefully not, ideally they are not in conflict. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the human lockdown give a good breather that mother nature needed, and the strengthen of core energy and it is a big wake up of things that can happen and have been happening since the 2000. This is not the first time heavy measures are taken around here, happened in 2003 too late, and 2009 and this time was more of a hidden fear than a direct attack, but was more global than the last 2 times. The issue to really think is about the next wave of these viruses which now in China and in some countries are dealing with, it is part of the same situation, but and will be a next, how will be, did we learn how we need to take care and protect others and protect ourselves. I am sure the next virus - if you see the 2000 to the present times - won\u2019t be any easier to prevent, control and deal with like Covid. This is Sars II and every good horror story has a 3rd part. And we are living the horror of human irresponsibility with nature. It is great to see how with the lockdowns animals reappear in this and that place, even some that were thought extinct. Are we going to keep going hammering mother nature with our progress or we will stop and realise this is going to a bad place ? I already knew and keep mother nature in mind since I know myself. Outdoors is a connection I had before, but due to physical issues and lack of time I do not enjoy all I wanted but when I can I enjoy a good outdoor time. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. The honest answer is I didn\u2019t need a pandemic to appreciate how critical nature and a connection to the outdoors are. My experiences in our national park system literally changed the course of my life to a path I find much more rewarding than where I would be had I elected to continue my twenty- five years in corporate America. As for the impact of the pandemic, my wife is a doctor and endured tremendous stress during the pandemic\u2019s early days. She\u2019s come to rely on the trips I plan into our parks as a reset and a stress relief valve. When the lockdowns were all the rage, it was hard to find locations close enough for quick weekend trips. We also cancelled plans to visit Alaska in late June and replaced that trip by driving the length of the Blue Ridge Parkway and across North Carolina to the Outer Banks. In the end, our park time in 2020 hasn\u2019t decreased much from what it would have been, though the destinations changed. The pandemic did change my wife\u2019s appreciation for what I had done in completing my goal to visit all 421 National Park Service units, originally finished on December 8, 2017 when there were still 417 units. I never took for granted traveling to places like Guam, American Samoa or the Alaskan wilderness. Now, it\u2019s nearly impossible to reach those locations. You never know when the window of opportunity to explore will close. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. GDP must take account of the natural world's value: The existing financial system is corrupt and GDP is dysfunctional. The Covid-19 pandemic is essentially because of greed from the corrupt neo-liberal neo capitalized global economy, which is unregulated, and principally responsible for the destruction and devastation that being forced on the mass of the population of the planet, and the environment, causing catastrophic retaliation from nature, because our species is working against it, rather than being partners with it and preserving and conserving our natural world of biodiversity. The economists' blindness to the extraordinary value of nature is dangerous, Our overriding faith in business, profit and in science and technology is both, at times, unrealistic and potentially catastrophic. We cannot continue to dismiss what is occurring before our very eyes if we are to call ourselves genuinely civilized. We need to accept that the crisis of toxicity in our ecosystem and environment is growing exponentially and killing off our insects,fish, birds, flora and fauna and wild animals at an alarming rate because we have placed growth and profit ahead of people and of the welfare of nature and this planet. It is surely time that the individual was placed well ahead of business and egregious profit. Once abused and gone, we will never be able to replace nature and what we now take for granted, which means that future generations through our selfishness will live in a world of bare-survival because our pollinators and indeed, nature as we now know it, will be extinguished through our greed. Business- as- usual economics is not even optional. We must instead have a total fresh approach and re-think, for if we fail, we are on the fast road to this planets demise. GDP increases automatically through for instance, our producing toilet paper by chopping down a rainforest. Crime figures escalating with the dangerous rise in knife, gun crime, drug trafficking and money laundering, these will automatically mean that GDP increases substantially. Then add the resulting soaring investment in new courts and prisons with the additional lawyers legal work, and a rise in police numbers necessarily taking part, plus the accompanying media coverage. All such factors increase GDP. The destruction of our landscape heritage through poor and inappropriate building developments, property developers and shoddy building speculators land-banking for years to force-up future property prices and this with thoroughly bad planning increases GDP. Cruelty to our livestock through appalling abattoir procedures or unnecessarily transporting them live increases GDP. And If through pollution and greed,we kill our biodiversity all our pollinators, the oceans empty of fish and poison all our rivers, and we chop down every last tree, making every last breath of air toxic to the point that we asphyxiate everything, GDP will still keep on rising and the economy figures could still be growing. So that's apparently alright then! False economic intervention by the neoliberal governments of all colours, has given away and is still giving away hundreds of billions of pounds by transferring it to the very wealthiest -the wealth extractor speculators, including business corporations, outsourcing groups, and institutions. These lobby such governments for their own selfish environmental destroying agenda, and with somewhat spurious methods, these financialization cohorts are too often provided with generous party funds in return. Surely, this is our democracy going haywire? And-which anyway is feeble in its integrity to act for all the people the first place - being stifled and diminished at an alarming rate? While it is certainly true that GDP measures what we produce, it robustly fails to have the ability to factor in the cost of what we destroy to make it in the first place including our existing democracy and rapidly failing human rights. Perhaps we should have a total re-think of what our economy and our debased democratic system is all about before it is too late? Reform of all our systems is vital, and possibly a total renaissance of how the whole globe is (so incompetently) governed. As currently it is only for the sole benefit of a small minority over the vast mass of the others. But it is only the latter that can stand up and say, \u201cenough is enough, for it is time for us all to accept change for the good of the future welfare of all on this planet. Otherwise, time is fast running out. The annual scientific clock is now pointing to 100 SECONDS to MIDNIGHT: Our species will have to enforce fundamental lifestyle change as we now know it or go to extinction. Perhaps we should ALL reflect on this:- Humankind's relationship with nature and its animals have brought a pandemic crashing down on our heads. Destroying wildlife habitat at breakneck speed while participating in the capture, breeding, trading, and consumption of wild and exotic animals has brought us dangerously close to the estimated 650,000 to 840,000 unidentified viruses that scientists say could be transmitted from wildlife to humans \u2014 the corona-19 virus was one of them. And while a pandemic is inherently global in nature, a huge part of the onus of preventing one falls on the United States and the United Kingdom government system, because of their stupidity and greed in promoting deregulation of neocapitalism over the welfare of their people, the environment, and all living things on the planet.

Individuals such as Prince Charles, David Attenborough, Al Gore, and much earlier people like John Muir, were speaking when most were silent or ignorant. In Africa, however, as was the case in Europe in earlier centuries, and with the indigenous peoples of North America and Australia, we live cheek by jowl with raw nature, and have traditionally been better custodians of our living environment.

Since then, I have probably camped out in a tent more than 1,000 times and lived in houses on the Chesapeake Bay, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Potomac River for more than 50 years. We retired to a house on a big lake in the Midwest, just so we could be close to the water and nature. The COVID pandemic has just reinforced the importance of nature and the outdoors in our lives. There is so much to see and to do, and there is something incredibly therapeutic about experiencing the outdoors. Your mind clears itself of worries and stress, and focuses on the wonder of nature.

The lesson good people like yourself must learn is that Nature isn\u2019t the friend of any species.

Covid-19 and the lockdowns should hopefully remind us that Nature is the principal cause of death in the world, killing-off about a million people every week. We need to understand that \u2018Wildlife\u2019 is not accurately represented by cuddly Pandas but by Nature\u2019s invisible army of pathogens which kills-off every hapless animal which miraculously manages to survive being killed by other animals.
