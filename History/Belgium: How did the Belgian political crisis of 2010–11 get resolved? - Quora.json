            "answer_text": "(Disclaimer: My perspective is from the Flemish side.) The N-VA had 3 big demands: much better controlled immigration and integration policies (conservative demand)separatist issues related to culture and language (demand from people living near the language border)separatist issues related to money (demand from economic right wing)The king (or the people behind him) played a political role. They didn\u2019t leave the initiative to form a government to Mr. De Wever. He had this right only for 6.6% of the time, despite representing by far the biggest individual party. (The socialist bloc received 72%.) Then when it was his turn they gave him an impossible deadline (10 days). He worked day and night and passed it. But the biggest Francophone party (PS) torpedoed it before they could even have read it properly. I think the problem was that these different Flemish constituencies had found each other and posed demands that, though IMO individually reasonable, came across as an ultimatum. It probably was. Each year, the North subsidizes 6\u20137 billion Euro to the South (not disputed). There is no honest precedent for this (disputed, but IMO unreasonably so). The natural riches are also the same\u2026 except for the ports of Zeebrugge and Antwerp (disputed). Ultimately a \u201ctripartite\u201d was formed, consisting of the Big Three traditional power blocks: (Euro)Liberals, Christian-Democrats and Socialists / Social-Democrats. One must not forget that also on the Flemish side there was a lot of disdain for the N-VA from them. This was the first time in over a century that the fundamental balance of powers was upended. Mr. De Wever meanwhile became mayor of Antwerp, the biggest and most important Flemish city \u2014 the first interruption of socialist / social-democrat rule in 90 years, excluding Nazi occupation! De Wever was perceived as an acerbic populistic bully in the Francophone press, though an admittedly extremely intelligent one, who can only be blamed for bringing certain people together \u2014 not for forging their ideology in the first place. Di Rupo was perceived as a charlatan in the North, who played every bit of his considerable charm mercilessly, but also an idealist from a poor immigrant background. Both were seen as Einzelgangers, alone on a date with history, dwelling in spheres of (sleep-deprived) existance far above and beyond the common folk.  Di Rupo I held firm for 3 years. They reformed some ethnic-linguistic issues. After this, a Flemish-dominated right-wing government was formed, consisting of: Flemish side: N-VA, Christian-Democrats, EuroliberalsFrancophone (i.e. Walloon + Bruxellois) side, only the Euroliberals (the MR)They prioritized stricter immigration policies and some economic reform. (Realistic) partition talk has for the moment died out, but one shouldn\u2019t forget that the last time it happened, it was borne out of frustration with the negotiating position of other side, not due to some deep-seated romanticism. The Belgian Revolution (1830) happened under similar circumstances. Economic disparities remain unchanged. The PS remains in charge in Brussels and Wallonia \u2014 uninterruptedly since about 3 decades. However, the latest developments are strange. After the umpteenth corruption scandal and the election of Emmanuel Macron in France, the PS tumbled in the polls. The Walloon Christian-Democrats (\u201cHumanists\u201d) did a Brutus on Di Rupo\u2019s Caesar, withdrawing from their coalition. Meanwhile the communists are usurping voters left in the void. Their Euroliberals\u2019 top brass are meanwhile embroiled in an international bribery scandal known as Kazakh-gate\u2026 \u201cOooh laa laa. \u00c7a c\u2019est la Belgique ca\u2026 !\u201d, as king Albert quips in a \u201890s rap satire.

            "answer_text": "*Depends on what you view as left wing. The parties involved were socialists, christian democrats/humanists and Liberals. In Belgium christans and humanists are concidered central and liberals are concidered right wing. So, in conclusion, one could state that is was a central government. *The Flemish parties. There was a strong feeling (at that time maybe more than now) that Flanders was being held back by Wallonia and that regional governments should hold more power. The N-VA, which was the ,accepted party with the most radical views on this subject and had an enormous increase in seats (28% of the popular vote in Flanders). The Flemish parties wanted enough of their demands concerning state roforms to be met because they were affraid that otherwise th N-VA would win the next elections even harder. *This is up for discussion of course, but imop it's twofold: From the Walloon side it was hard to meet the demands of the N-VA. And from N-VA's side it was hard to step into a government with the Walloon socialists who've they \"demonised\" dureing the campaign. I personally think that both the PS (Walloon socialists) and the N-VA would have lost many votes if they would've governed together. *No idea. * Since the state is thouroughly reformed, I'd say yes. The regions gained more power and the majority of the people are against another reform for now. The concensus is to at least wait and see the effects of the current reform. *No idea. ",
