            "answer_text": "Question : How do I get rid of a gaming addiction? Preamble : You can\u2019t change somebody else. You can help if that person asks for it, but the effort must come from an internal motivation. We, as a community, do not agree on what is a gaming addiction or if it exists at all. It does not really matter. What is important right now, is your feeling that you are playing too much. You are conscious there\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s a sign of maturity and you are not afraid to reach out. I am proud of you ! The most common advice is to ask for help and find trustworthy people. It\u2019s a good starting point, but nobody can \u201cfix\u201d you in your place. Of course, everybody is different, you must find a way that works for you. The following is my method, maybe you can draw some inspiration from it. Let\u2019s get down to business [to defeat\u2026], shall we ? Know yourself Isolate yourself in a calm place with paper and pencils. Breathe deeply three times. Feel the air filling your lungs. Take time to answer honestly. Why do you play ? Playing too much is usually a substitute for something else. What is missing in your life ? Do you feel lonely ? not heard ? without control on your own life ? Do you feel trapped in your own limits ? Do you feel the need to empty your mind ? Write it down, be precise, and keep that paper near you. You are not limited to writing : use some lists, drawing, colors, symbols, or everything that you are comfortable with. There may be a lot of emotions, accept the fact that they exist. But, this too shall pass. You are the master of your own life. Be the rock in the middle of the river, letting water flowing around you. Put some words on these emotions as well and write it next to the rest. Goals The next step is to give a more precise direction for your life. Make a life plan (How to Make a Life Plan) and find out what you want (and don\u2019t want) in your life. Another example that worked for me : imagine your own funeral (while it\u2019s a bit morbid, the exercise is real). Next to the coffin, there is a booklet describing you. \u201cHere lies [your name]. He/she was \u2026\u201d How would you like for this to continue ? It\u2019s okay to have a vague idea for your long-term objectives, but your short-term should be realist (SMART Goals \u2013 How to Make Your Goals Achievable). Review everything once in a while. You are your best friend Don\u2019t forget that you are the person that will accompany you until the end, at least make this person interesting\u2026 Find hobbies. Go outside, try different activities, learn to do something. Bonus points if it involves other people, like team sports, choirs, tabletop rpg, board games, ... or use your hands to create/craft something (pottery, woodworking, metalworking, painting, origami, juggling\u2026). Have a look at all the clubs around you. In my case, I like to tell stories and I\u2019m a developer, so I took some lessons in game design (excellent yt series : Extra Credits: Season 1 - YouTube). As a side advantage, now I can\u2019t play a game without analyzing what works and what doesn\u2019t. Once I find all the major patterns of mechanics and gameplay, it feels repetitive (few hours per game) so I become bored and simply stop. Games and you Stopping entirely requires an iron will. I suppose you wouldn\u2019t be reading this if you had this will. The problem is not the game, it\u2019s your behavior with the game. Games should be leisure and pleasure activities. Let\u2019s put some rules : Gaming only after homework and housework.Each time you start a game, be conscious that you play because you WANT it, not because of habit. It makes a difference.Do a break each hour, get up, do a few jumping-jack, abs and push-ups.Set an alarm 15 min before bed, and stop everything when it rings.Stop playing when you\u2019re not having fun.Don\u2019t forget to write down your progress in your calendar ! Setbacks You will have relapses. Let\u2019s face it, someday it will come by rote, maybe from another cause : your SO dumped you, your favorite sport team lost a match, and you just want to empty your mind. The \u201cunthinkable\u201d happens. So after your setback, you \u201cwake up\u201d and regret your action. You can\u2019t change the past, but you can do better. You are a beautiful and evolving human being. You are worthy of love. I have faith in your ability to get up after your fall. Without silence, how could you appreciate music in its entirety ? Your efforts to become better will shine more if you are aware that you will have setbacks. But even though you know it will happen, you continue to fight, you magnificent bastard. The key is to get up more times than you fall, and measure the growing time between setbacks. You are not alone. Thank you for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally feel you can and should limit the amount of time children spends playing any kind of video game or other type of screen time. Also I personally feel parents could benefit from using a \u201cwhen/then\u201d policy with video games and screen time. Example: \u201cWhen you have finished these listed responsibilities- (detailed and specific) then you can have one hour of screen time.\u201d Examples of responsibilities: homework, clean room, daily chore, showers. You can even give bonus time by saying something like \u201dIf you have completed those responsibilities then you may do any of these other bonus chores for extra time.\u201d and list the extra chore in writing with the amount of extra time. Example: dishes 10 minutes, laundry 5 minutes, sweeping in the kitchen 5 minutes, taking out the trash 5 minutes, 20 minutes of reading 10. This only works if you are consistent with making sure the responsibilities are actually being met and then refusing to allow the reward when it's not until it is. AND that you pick chores your children are actually capable of doing and continue to reassess their ability by age. If these is new to your family try only one responsibility at a time. I also see no reason why a 16 year shouldn't have a higher level of responsibility than their 12 year old sibling, or their 8 sibling, or their 5 year old sibling for the same reward. (Have them consider aging a level up- the higher level you get in life the harder the boss battle) Same thing for differently abled children, or handicapped children, base chores on what they are capable of. Don't think they can't be responsible for anything because they don't have the same ablity as someone else. Find something they can be responsible for and allow them to be responsible. It's good for everyone. I also don't see a reason for people to shelter children from the connection between recreation and responsibilities at the younger ages. \u201dYou can play when the work is done\u201d and \u201dtake care of what you have or you lose it.\u201d make for an easier transaction into adulthood. Which is the goal right? Adults with more responsible at work make more money, people with money have better luxuries. If adults choose to stop working, or working as well, they're choosing to give up the luxuries they already have. Start that thought process young and it won't be such a shocker. Most kids I see with video game addictions have inconsistent rules around video games. Very few actually have a true addiction, or truly addictive personalities or behaviors. However if you do have consistent rules around games and still feel your child has an addiction to it you can and should always get help from a pediatric therapist. Your regular doctor can refer you. Most insurance cover them. They can also help you build better reward system or goal setting than some random idiot online who has never met you or your kid- like me (random idiot right here). I do hope you find the best information to help you and your child.  ",

            "answer_text": " Photo by Matt Sclarandis Hi, I am Niklas I'm 28 from Sweden, I was in this situation a couple of years back, I wanna share this with you, hopefully, you will get a spark and take action and you can get to the point where I am today. If you like this I highly appreciate upvotes so more can see this and hopefully take something from it, thank you! The way I could keep myself from going back was committing to the goals that I never thought I could achieve, DONT sell yourself short, The last two years of gaming I was bored and I could never seem to get this idea out of my head, that if I put the same amount of time and commitment into my goals as I did to games I could achieve my goals and in the end, have something to be proud of and to show for, and have great joy and genuine fulfilment in life, don't get me wrong, I do not hate games, I had some great moments in games and I met a lot of great people, but in the end, there was just emptiness. It was hard to quit since I've always been a (gamer) it's who I was, the turning point was when I allowed myself to think differently, that there is more to me than just being a gamer, telling myself that If I can turn my thinking around I can be just as great and have the same drive and commitment in life as I had in games. I always had this feeling deep inside that I was meant for so much more than working a job just so I could survive, and then that's that, coming home and gaming until it was time to go work again, I knew this was not the thing I was meant to do. I had many trials and errors trying to find that thing that could give me the drive to not go back to gaming, now in hindsight I know that I had to first take a deep look inwards instead of outwards. What I mean by that is what do I want to do, for me, and no one else. No matter if at this point I don't know how to actually do it. Just knowing that I can if I just start. If I wanna find something, I have to look for it, and that's what I did, but not only that, when I do see it I have to commit myself to know if it's real to me. I was always searching and making decisions without actually jumping in the water, I always had a sense of passion, a sense of joy, and excitement growing up watching my uncle and grandfather building there business, the leadership the creative side and helping others. I did not know that doing something for someone was the thing that brought me the most fulfilment & sense of complete, so to get myself to take action and start studying on how I could do this for myself was finding others that had done the same, I mean people that had the thinking as I did, but had overcome the blocks, people that had the same positive mindset, that it is possible, this helped me a ton, having someone telling you that I was there but now I'm here, made it so much more tangible for me. the more I opened up my mind to the possibility that it's actually possible If I'm willing to suffer for a while sacrificing something to go somewhere, I had soon reversed my mind and thoughts, that I can, and I will do what it takes. Even if my friends, my close ones, or just judgement from the outside world is not aligned with my vision. When I look back now I can see it much more clear, the pinpoints that I did that made real change for me, I'm still the man I was, but now I'm more aligned with myself than before, imagine stormy water, and now there is no wind, a much clearer path of direction. Of course, I do have doubts from time to time as everyone does, but now I have the knowledge that doubt is removed by action. CHANGED MY THOUGHTS TO CHANGE MY IDENTITY: basically telling myself that I'm not just a gamer I am what I choose to be, we are what we think about, this is hard at first, I did not believe myself at the beginning, it was just a weird feeling overall. Something that helped me a huge deal with this was having someone I respected telling me that you can do this, and not just \" cheering you on \" as a fast line with no meaning, genuinely this was what the person felt, so basically surround yourself with people that have a positive mindset and are genuine, that sees the greatness in you.HAVING SOMETHING TO WORK FOR AND STRIVE TO BE BETTER: for me, this is what I call \"the Bait/hook\" a big goal that you wanna work towards, doh this needs to be real to you and no one else. something you have a sense of passion or drive for, we all have these thoughts in our heads \"what if I could have/create/learn that job, carrier, instrument or whatever it is that's floating in your mind, this is a HUGE benefit for having a sense of purpose to do stuff in general and long lasting resluts and drive, for example, for me I always wanted to build/create something, so I started looking into the business, I was always intrigued by people running a business, the creative part, helping others, the leadership, at first I was just not confident to go at it, so here is where the \" small wins \" comes in, start small, with these small wins you will get going, and soon the ball will be rolling, and with momentum comes great results, find someone that is where you wanna be in this \" category \" so if you feel it won't work, or at any point, you lose the drive, just go back to this influencer/person and keep sparking the drive.MOVEMENT: Implementing Execersise, this can be anything from running, lifting weights, and so on, as long as it works up a good sweat, strengthening body, mind, and thoughts, this a huge benefit in my case, it gave me great clarity overall.PAIN/SACRIFICE: This is not again to scare you, it's just that something worthwhile, there will always be some pain/struggle to get there but in the end, it's worth it, and what we can do is implement things just like the above mentioned to make it easier on the way there!THE WILLPOWER AND DISCIPLINE: if you are completely out of it, start small, for example, cold showers, plan a walk every Monday, even if it's a rainy day, you do it, even plan a shower, plan a cleaning day, and execute! I know it can be hard in the beginning but Believe me, doubt is removed by action.I Have great hope for your progress, I know you will get there if you start by taking action and executing! I was deep down on the bottom in pitch-black darkness and now I'm at the surface and can finally see the light again, I know you can do it too.I hope this was not too much of a rant, I just resonate so much that I wanna share with you some knowledge because I know the pain and I don't wish that on anyone.If you have any other questions I'm happy to help, if you want to have a deeper chat with me, I'm always just a DM away, and that goes for anyone that is struggling in this matter.Sometimes having someone holding you accountable and guiding you through the hurdles if that's not something you can do by your own is a great way to get big long-lasting results.The pain of not taking action, not going after it, is overwhelmingly greater than the pain of failing on something you want to accomplish. If you got this far, thanks for sticking to the end. Sincerely Niklas. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe video games are actually a force for good in the world. Addiction, not so much. When I sold my PS3 to focus on other things, I eventually bought a PS4. That didn\u2019t work. I moved from New Jersey to New York, started a whole new life. Games became apart of that. Moving away didn\u2019t work. I tried a 90-day detox. On day 4 or something I picked the controller back up and played even more than I did before. That didn\u2019t work. I joined a community of well-to-do people and it was awesome while it lasted. I had a falling out with the \u201cleader\u201d of that community and decided I couldn\u2019t be apart of the group anymore, for my own integrity\u2019s sake. Back to video games. That didn\u2019t work. Not for good anyway. The only thing that worked for me was facing it head on. I stopped judging myself. I ignored the shame. I ignored the people\u2019s voices in my head that told me ignorant things like \u201cvideo game addiction isn\u2019t a real addiction\u201d and \u201cget a plan and do something with your life\u201d and similar things. I studied addiction like a college major. Eventually, after learning so much about what was going on inside myself, I hit a tipping point. Overcoming video game addiction was an educated decision. It was conviction, and for the first time I felt like I was facing it from a position of power. Knowledge really is power. I learned that one aspect of addiction is that it\u2019s a coping mechanism, in every case, whatever the addiction is to. It\u2019s always a coping mechanism, meaning I had to face whatever I was using games to cope with. For me, it was a cocktail of things that I really can\u2019t get into right now, but I had to work through feelings of frustration and regret. It all revolved around my upbringing - church and school and then just feeling like I was lied to. \u201cShit didn\u2019t turn out the way they said\u201d kind of thing. Another important thing to note is the role dopamine plays in addiction. Most people know that dopamine is responsible for that feeling of reward and achievement. I forget who coined the term, but you can refer to it as \u201cthe pleasure of the feast.\u201d However, dopamine is also responsible for your level of drive - it\u2019s that feeling of desire, longing for something. This is \u201cthe pleasure of the hunt.\u201d Simply put, addiction creates an imbalance here. It\u2019s why you\u2019re asking this question, it\u2019s why you want to stop but you can\u2019t. Drive is a chemical reaction. An external stimulus can fix this, a sacrifice or setting very high stakes. My marriage was at stake because of my addiction to video games; this didn\u2019t fix my addiction necessarily, but it gave me perspective. Also, after studying addiction, I realized a bunch of other things at stake as well - most notably, TIME. What\u2019s at stake for you? Or what can you give up that will hurt so much that your drive will reset and redirect itself? Edit: Sometimes the thing at stake isn\u2019t anything tangible. I know of a woman who was addicted to both cocaine and heroin. She lost her opportunity for college education. She lost the love of her life. She lost her family. She lost her home. She lost almost everything. She was still an addict. Then, one time there was a drug-bust in her neighborhood and her supplier ended up in prison. To get drugs, she contemplated sleeping with her best friend\u2019s boyfriend, who happened to be a dealer in another neighborhood. The fact that she seriously considered this was enough to make her realize she had a problem and she became serious about overcoming her addiction; she began to seek help. Dignity was at stake. Here\u2019s my point: you\u2019re on the right track by asking this question. The faster and more voraciously you learn about what you\u2019re going through right now, the faster you\u2019ll grow out of this. BTW, I still play video games. ",

            "answer_text": "Since I\u2019m a Gamer (someone who plays video games on a daily basis), I probably wouldn\u2019t be the best person to come to for this particular question. But I\u2019ll take a stab at it. Boredom. If a game doesn\u2019t interest you as much as it use to, eventually you\u2019ll get the same feeling from your other games. And to make things harder as a gamer, you want to play other games but you don\u2019t own them, you don\u2019t have the money to get them, you know no one who owns who you could borrow it from, and you don\u2019t have the means to play it even if you did buy it (Console or Computer Hardware). And though you have these other 100+ games, you jut feel \u201cI don\u2019t feel like play this or this or this or this\u201d and get to a point where you\u2019ll do something else to relieve the boredom. I was in that state for a couple months. I own close to 200 games, I\u2019ve beaten barely 10 of them. I\u2019ve played half of them, but the others I haven\u2019t bothered with and sometimes question why I got them in the first place. But yeah, I hit that point and every game becomes uninteresting. There is no real cure for it. Even if the games are taken away, we\u2019ll just crave it worse than a woman on her period who wants chocolate. And if we REALLY enjoy playing that game, even if we\u2019ve beaten it a dozen times already, we\u2019ll probably never let it go til something better comes along or boredom finally hits us. The big difference with Video Game Addiction vs Drugs - Games can\u2019t kill you. And while many games are meant for shooting, fighting, whatever, there are others that have puzzles in them that will push the limits of our brains and make us think, make us learn something to beat the challenge. One game in particular - The Secret World (Now \u201cSecret World Legends\u201d) uses quests that require the player to LEARN real world stuff to beat the quest, like finding out when a pirate did this, or memorizing who signed the declaration of independence, or even who the secretary of state was in this date, and the information needed would be REAL, not made up. Hell, there was a quest I came across that required me to read the Bible, look for a certain verse, and them compare the verse shown in game with the real one & pick out what ISN\u2019T suppose to be in the verse. And then there are games made by intellectual directors where you\u2019ll come across words being used in the game, but you don\u2019t know what they mean, and unless you find out what they mean, you\u2019ll never understand what is going on in the game. So whats the only option? Look them up in the dictionary. So you\u2019re not wasting your life away. People enjoy TV, Movies, Music, Art, Science/Math Lectures, whatever, but it is still a pleasure that people do & enjoy, and if video games are an addiction, then so is everything else. Another big thing that differs games from drugs - We\u2019re not so addicted to it that we\u2019ll suffer physical & mental anguish like we would from Alcohol & Cigarettes. I am a smoker as well. I am addicted to it. But the difference? I WANT TO QUIT SMOKING cause I know it will kill me someday, plus it\u2019s an expensive that serves no other purpose than to make me sane, and I know that once I\u2019m no longer addicted that I\u2019ll be free from it & that much richer, THEN I\u2019ll be able to get the things I want. What really keeps me from having & playing the games I want? Cigarettes. Cause if I had to choose what I feel like I need more than other, games are at the bottom & cigarettes are at the top. So I doubt you\u2019ll want to subject kids to worse addiction than games just to get them to stop, but pretty much if you want them to stop, they\u2019ll have to either get bored of playing them or satisfy something greater. That\u2019s all I got. ",

            "answer_text": "I stopped my video game addiction about eight or nine years ago. When I did, I went about a year without playing games at all, then after awhile I played them in moderation. Today I own a PS4, PSVR, Xbox One X, a steering wheel, an Oculus Go, and a nice collection of games and I play all of them responsibly. First off, I will tell you the WRONG way to try and get rid of your addiction. That is to get rid of all your game systems and games and just say \u201cno more\u201d. I tried that and I got really depressed and bored, and a few weeks later I was gaming again. So what happened were two things. First, I had bought myself a big TV, a nice sound system, PS3, and a racing wheel and played Gran Turismo Five for several months staying up all night until I beat it. When it was over, I said to myself, \u201cIt can\u2019t get any better than this\u201d and I lost interest. Why? Because satisfaction is the opposite of addiction. If you are satisfied, you are done with something. Now, this first part I can\u2019t possibly advise you on how to stage for yourself. For me it was incidental. I simply gamed until I was satisfied. The second thing that happened is I developed interest in other things, and for me it was language learning. This is an activity that I find deeply satisfying and something that I could do that shifted my attention off of gaming. So find something that is SATISFYING that you can put your attention on instead of gaming. Something beneficial. In other words, don\u2019t break your addiction to gaming by taking up drinking or drugs. Lastly, an addiction is only an addiction if you do whatever it is to such an extent that you neglect important things, like work, sleep, people, taking care of yourself, etc. If you can maintain your responsibilities in life and can handle your problems, and still game a lot, then you are not addicted. So take care of yourself, and take care of others, and if you can game without staying up all night every night, then go ahead and do so. ",

            "answer_text": "The term addiction is often used loosely, and some people merely overdo things for awhile before moderating. However when it comes to video games and other internet activities, abuse or addiction is common. All addiction is chemical. Playing video games causes a release of chemicals in your brain which makes you feel good. There is nothing wrong with feeling good, but soon your brain has burned some deep neural pathways concerning the instantaneous reward you feel when playing video games. A pattern of thinking has developed that playing videos games is the best thing going. Other activities that you once enjoyed and activities necessary for you to be productive and happy in the long run have a hard time competing with the immediate rewards you rerceive from playing video games. Again, in many cases such a desire is merely a strong compulsion that can be controlled with some effort. In some cases, especially with people predisposed to addiction, it is a real addiction involving a seemingly uncontrollable obsession and compulsion. In my opinion, in the case of severe overuse or a real addiction, once you admit it, the best way to overcome it is to seek support and accountability. Find someone you trust who will understand, explain the situation, and talk with them regularly about how you are doing with video games. Just as importantly, find a range of other activities that make you feel good. Not just one, but a variety, so you don't merely replace one addiction with another. Preferably, some of these activities should include other people. Try some fun things, but also try doing some things on a regular basis that help other people, whether family, friends, or volunteering to help strangers. Scientific studies have revealed that helping other people is a strong motivator and also brings a strong feeling of reward and accomplishment. If some games are particularly tempting you may want to delete them temporarily or permanently, but merely deleting them won't solve the problem. Video games will always be there and you cannot hide from them forever. Better to deal with the root problem. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s how I did it: First, find a piece of paper. On this piece of paper, write I WILL NOT PLAY VIDEO GAMES FOR THE NEXT 3 MONTHS(Insert date). This is called 90 day detox ,the most simple yet effective method to stop playing video games(or any addiction). Do not touch your video games for the next 3 months, that\u2019s it. This will ONLY work if your brain is ready to take it there. You should be thinking how to stop this nuance from your life, not, I really love video games but since it\u2019s bad I want to stop. In other words, your brain should kindle the light of stopping this addiction rather than a outside source. My guess is right now you are only playing video games as an addiction. You have grown up to the point where you don\u2019t truly like video games any more. It\u2019s pretty hard to describe this feeling, but this was the case with me and a couple of friends as well. By taking this detox, you will outgrow this hobby. For me, the 3rd week was when the urges came back. Although after a month, I didn\u2019t think about it even once. Do not try to bilk this plan even once in the 3 months, or else you will have to start over. The reasoning for this technique is to get rid of the physical connections of attributing video games to happiness in your brain. Unfortunately this is only the first part. Notice how I told you get a sheet of paper, not a post it note. After writing the message said above, you are going to need to find and write other hobbies or ways to keep you occupied while you do this. The reason behind this is to suppress the urges to play video games. By filling in your schedule, there is a lower probability of you even creating the concussions thought of playing video games. THIS PART IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE FIRST, or else you will get stuck in the loop. These are some of the tips based on my personal experience. REMEMBER, the number one thing in this process is YOU want to stop playing video games. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m an avid gamer, it\u2019s probably my favourite hobby, but there is no denying video games nowadays are designed to keep you playing for long periods of time. They are no longer products, they are services. When I was growing up games were often brutally difficult. I\u2019d take a break from gaming on my own, after hitting a difficult section. Today almost all games are built around some form of progression. With experience levels, weapon unlocks/upgrades, achievements etc. There is a gratifying feedback loop which mimics how slot machines work. Some people are more prone to getting addicted to this than others. I\u2019m one of those people. I used to have a \u2018completionist\u2019 mindset. I wanted to get all the achievements and rewards before I felt \u2018done\u2019 with a game. This turned playing games from a fun past-time into a job. I no longer played the game to have fun, I played to achieve some arbitrary goal. When you think about it, I was no longer a gamer, I was an employee working for the game systems. The only way to break out of this loop is to stop playing these types of games. Now I consciously avoid multiplayer games, MMOs etc. because I know I\u2019ll get sucked in to the loop. Getting this kind of self-discipline did not happen overnight. The first thing I did was give up playing for a period of weeks. I started going to the gym because exercise is a great way to generate a natural buzz. I also set achievable goals in my life and started working towards them immediately. None of these things were easy, but over time they became habits. And that\u2019s what it boils down to, change bad habits for good habits. Now when I play games, I play for me, not for someone elses notion of what \u2018completing\u2019 a game is. As Jim Rohn once said. Choose your pain. The pain of discipline or the pain of regret. I know what pain I\u2019d rather choose.  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not really the best person for this answer but I\u2019ll give my two cents. If you really believe you are addicted to video games, the best course of action would be to get some professional help from an addiction counselor or specialist.  Now for my two cents: When I was younger and more impressionable with less self control there was something I did that helped my self control in times in which I needed to focus on things other than video games. I removed the temptation entirely. Even when someone is addicted, you go through high points and low points. Immediately after your fix you don\u2019t crave another cigarette for at least a few minutes (depending on how addicted you are it could be longer). The trouble really comes later on when it\u2019s been days/weeks/months without the fix. For things like substance abuse this can be difficult as since these are consumables it\u2019s already your habit to go and buy more so often times people buy the thing they\u2019re addicted to without realizing it and then the temptation is in front of them again. Video games are a bit different. They\u2019re tied to something (and something expensive to) whether it\u2019s that PS4, Xbox, PC, or phone. What I did was completely remove the box (whatever it was) while I was in a moment of self control (usually right after I finished playing something) and gave it to a trusted person (started with a parent, then went to a friend) under the conditions that I not get it back until whatever I needed to accomplished was finished (usually a month or two but if you want to stop playing entirely it would be forever). Since the other person doesn\u2019t care as much about video games as I do/did they wouldn\u2019t see why it was a big deal and would easily keep it away from me. I suggest you do the same. If you\u2019re a console or PC gamer, remove the box from your environment. Either give it away sell it or smash it to bits. If it\u2019s a phone do the same. Since you need a phone in a modern day environment simply pick up a dumb phone from your provider (they\u2019re dirt cheap now) and it will have everything you need without the ability to play games on it. Since many people do work on their computers I suggest doing your work on a PC that isn\u2019t one you own. Either go to the library or do work at your office on your work PC. If you have a work environment where you work in a private location (IT professionals come to mind) change a bit of your environment so that other people can see that you are working and not playing a game. You don\u2019t have to tell them that\u2019s what your doing usually the fear of getting caught/losing your job for playing video games is enough. IF you start getting that itch at work, tell your supervisor what you\u2019re going through and that you may need assistance to not play games at work. I\u2019m sure they would much rather keep you on board than fire you for a stupid infraction like playing games instead of working, so they will figure something out to help you.  Still the best advise is to seek professional help. They may advise you not do this. I would go with that and whatever else they suggest. They are the professional, I am not. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is some advice to help you get rid of your addiction: 1)Start it slow: No addiction can be overcome in a matter of days,weeks,or months.You should take small steps towards achieving your goal every day .In your case you can play a couple minutes less than the day before each day.Even if you don\u2019t succeed in maintaining your streak,don\u2019t get angry,frustrated or even worese,defeated because those emotions are the last thing you need.A couple minutes can seem like something insignificant,but if you remain loyal to this advice every day you will be paying your games much less time than before in less than a month. 2)Try something else to distract you: You may have heard this a million times already so I\u2019m not bothering you by naming everything you can do instead of video games.But it\u2019s important that the activity you try either is one that requires concentration(I reccomend meditation) or is done in a social environment(a sport).No matter which one you pick,please make sure that it\u2019s an activity that you genuinely like,not one that you just do to escape your addiction. 3)Avoid staying alone: If you are alone and are doing nothing,your brain will automatically think about the activity that releases dopamine and makes it feel good(your brain does NOT like to be bored),in this case it will think about playing a game.This is when you feel the urge to play.Being with friends or family and having a nice conversation has a similiar effect to doing the activities mentioned above. 4)Don\u2019t look at your games/console(if you can) OK,maybe my formulation of the step was pretty barebones but that\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know any other way to say it.Keep your games out of sight.Put them in a drawer somewhere,where they won\u2019t be the first thing you look at when you enter your room.The same with your console(if you can move it somewhere where it stays hooked but out of sight).If you play on pc just remove the shortcuts or move them somewhere your eyes aren\u2019t immediately drawn to when you turn the PC on.This one step helped me a LOT when i overcame my gaming addiction and I hope it helps you too. 5)Seek help from family and friends: Every journey is easier with people at your side.Tell your beloved ones about your problem and I\u2019m sure they will try to help.This is not only psychological support but also they may also try to stop you when you are playing too much and bring the voice of reason in your head when the addiction has taken over. So,that\u2019s about it.For me,these steps were enough for me to get rid of my addiction and I hope they help you too.And don\u2019t forget:just the fact that you posted this question means that you are better than most(who play games for hours at a time and don\u2019t care about the consequesces)and have already made the first step towards your goal. (Ps:Please excuse any typos you see because i wrote this on my phone for lack of a more suitable device) ",

            "answer_text": "I was diagnosed with video-game addiction (by a psychologist who specialized in addictions and anorexia). First, I did everything I could to moderate my time. That didn\u2019t work. The problem is, the dopamine release from video-games will shut down the prefrontal cortex, responsible for higher thinking. So, even if I only spent 4 hours a day on gaming, the rest of the day would be spent in a fog. Moreover, it was extremely difficult to moderate the time I spent videogaming. Gaming addiction is all about the \u201c5 more minutes.\u201d I\u2019ll just hand in this quest, then I\u2019ll do that college assignment\u2026 I\u2019ll just go back to town to log off, then I\u2019ll get to sleep\u2026 I\u2019ll just vendor all the junk in my inventory, then I\u2019ll have that meal I\u2019ve been putting off for 3 hours. Next thing you know, you didn\u2019t sleep all night, and class or work starts in 40 minutes. It\u2019s important to note that games these days are designed to be uncompletable\u2026 back when it was all on NES carts and CD ROMs, it took about four days to beat a game, maybe a week or two to dig through all the secrets\u2026 and you were done. With MMO\u2019s, it\u2019s all about being in first place. The moment you stop playing, someone else is clawing their way up to the top spot, your spot, so you start loosing just by not playing (guild rankings, PVP scores, collecting a set of \u201craid gear\u201d for everyone in the guild\u2026 then you get new guild members, and you always want more guild members, they need raid gear). So, there is always more game to play: the players create an inexhaustible supply of \u201ccontent\u201d through competition. (Essentially, the business model of an MMO is to sell us, the players, to each other\u2026 we are not the consumers, we are the product). So, after about two years trying to moderate my time, I just quit (which is what my psychologist wanted from day one, but I was abstinent and he was very patient). Cold turkey. Period. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to just\u2026 stop playing. And there really is nothing short of cold-turkey that works, (for an actual addict). Mind you, the only thing that gave me the motivation to quit was my pursuit of art. You really can\u2019t do anything creative when your prefrontal cortex is a wad of cotton from dopamine, so it was either my artwork or the gaming. I went with art, and it probably saved my life. Don\u2019t get me started on how bad my diabetic management got while I was gaming\u2026 lost vision in one eye before I wizened up. ",

            "answer_text": "Look back at the way that you developed this addiction. Let me attempt to backtrack. Here you = Me :) I was having a regular schedule. Woke up as usual, go for a jog, come home and finish my breakfast, get ready for college, come home at tea time. In the evenings, I would call my friends for a game of cricket. We played for the next 4 hours until my dad would call out to me to come home. One fine evening after I finished my studies, I was lazily scrolling apps in my mobile phone when I hit upon a gaming app. Without much interest, I downloaded the game and started playing. Initially I wasn't much interested, but I continued to play since my friends had gone out with their parents. The game turned so interesting that soon I became addicted in a few months. Now I want to get out of this addiction. Look back the last few months at what I have lost. I stopped playing cricket, stopped my jogging, stopped chatting with my parents and generally lost a lot of activities. I knew I was heading towards a big problem. So what I did was to gradually go back to playing cricket, restarted my jogging, played the mobile game as well, made time to chat with my family, while I didnt stop gaming. What was happening is that I was reducing my gaming time, while retaking my lost hobbies like outdoor cricket, chatting with family and inviting friends home for dinner also. My friends asked me out for a movie, a long walk on the seaside, and often we would stop by a kiosk for bhel and pani purri. One fine morning, my mother asked me, beta have you stopped gaming ? I suddenly realised that indeed I have :) Happily I never went back to that addiction. I created more parking space in my life for far better things so much so that, unknowingly I had moved out gaming from its permanent parking space in my life. Never fight against a habit. Develop other habits that will gradually make the existing habit wither and fall away like dried leaves. Have I answered your question well ? ",

            "answer_text": "I am so glad that you have recognised this as a problem. Well done, pat yourself on the back for this. No, I am not being sarcastic here. I had this exact same problem during my college days and it turned out very bad for me and I ended up in mediocre job and even worse scores in my college, probably there was no one to guide me and mainly because I knew the problem and I didn't do anything about it. What you can start doing is have a timer set for everytime you start your gaming session. The reverse timer like 2 hours. The advantage with that is you cannot go snooze it. Once you complete your 2 hour quota for the day, no matter what stage or level you are on, you need to put down your controller and move out of the space. It will need a lot discipline and determination. If you tend to ignore the alarm, ask one of your friend or family member to intervene and stop you, but they need to do it very politely and after that you need to honor your agreement and discontinue it. If you want to take it further, then do the following - Reduce the timer from 2 hours to 1.5 hours after a week and a week later to 1 hour.Eventually after 4 weeks take up some time for gaming once in 2 days for 1 hour and then reudce it to once in four days for 1.5 hours.Have cheat days like on a Sunday afternoon or saturday afternoon, like 4 hours straight once in a month. No problem in having this, but you need to ensure that it does not repeat again in the same month.Reduce online multiplayer gaming, stick to single player campaigns.Keep rewarding yourself, like after you finish your assignment, game for an hour or so.Absolutely no gaming when you need to meet critical deadlines for a assignment/home work/project/exams.I used to game everyday for close to 2 years. But now i game once or twice in week for 4-5 hours on total. Like I mentioned before, you need some discipline and determination to sort this addiction. It is not totally bad, but anything in excess is really harmful. Messgae me of you need more help. ",

            "answer_text": "Games are fun but can get addictive quite easily. As an active and frequent player I understand what you are going thorough. Video games can take up so much time and arr bad for your posture and long term health. But health amounts of gaming can help you get better in various aspects, such as improved reflexes, concentration, decision making etc. So it has both negative and positive sides. It all depends how you use it. Of course, how \u201caddicted\" you are will determine how much time or difficulty you'll face. You can follow some simple rules - Set gaming time limit. DO NOT in any circumstances exceed this time limit.Start removing games from your mobile/PC and unsubscribe from platforms such as steam origin.Engage yourself somewhere else. Idle mind will run back to it's comfort zone. You'll start making excuses to start gaming again unless you engage somewhere else. Right now you probably spend a good chunk of time gaming. Invest this time somewhere else. Pick up a sport. Learn a new language. Keep your brain busy. Fill up those hours you're now getting which you wasted in gaming.Start exercising! Join a gym or workout at home. Develop a regime and stick to it. Replace your addiction with a new, healthy one. Make healthy things your addiction. Get addicted to healthy food. Get addicted to being fit. Get addicted to books! Just as you have to practice several hours in a game to get good at it, these things will also take time, but these things will serve you well, unlike games.Take control of yourself, game if you want to, but for healthy times. To just relax wnd unwind sometimes.Slowly decrease your gaming hours. Stopping it all immediately will only give your brain a shock and you won't be able to handle all the free time at your disposal. How you plan on reducing the time is upto you. Something like reducing 1 hr every week until you find that you're not wasting a lot of time.Do not game if you have a task to do or any work to do. Use gaming to only relax with the feeling that you're free and it's a small reward for completing your work. A time to relax a bit before moving on with the day or as a relaxing activity at the end of the day.Fix a time for gaming and fit it into your regime. Slowly reduce this time by taking up other activities.",

            "answer_text": "Just like all my other weekends, On a dull Saturday evening, I was sitting in front of my laptop searching for the players to join the game room I had created for Age of Empires. I was irritated. Thanks to the folks who kept coming and going and the game room was never full. Heck it had been more than half an hour and I hadn\u2019t got even a single chance to play a single game. My thoughts went back to the days when it all started. The group of folks in college, 10 years back, spending sleepless nights and days on gaming. That\u2019s what connected us together. Made us happy and sad together. Brought out hidden emotions out on our faces - happiness, anger, frustrations, fear, love and hate. We graduated, moved on with our own lives, but the passion for gaming never died. And here I was sitting after 10 years after having won countless number of games repeating the same old habit of mine without my old friends. Why? maybe because it made me nostalgic about the good old days, maybe it was the easiest source of getting the sense of self achievement for me, maybe it was only the few good things I was good at or maybe I was too scared to explore what life holds for me and was happy in my own cocoon. I don\u2019t know the answer. But deep down I knew that the gaming had become more than a source of entertainment for me. It had become a habit, an obsession to get the easy wins which are far more difficult to achieve in the real life. My train of thoughts were broken by the sound of \u201cStart the game already\u201d from my virtual world. I was back to the present and the game room I was waiting for was full. And instead of pressing the start button for the game, I pressed the shut down button of the laptop. And that\u2019s how it all stopped. I went out sat with my flatmates and discussed some boring stuff. But surprisingly I actually felt good. It has been more than 2 years since I stopped hardcore gaming. I do play once in a while but only when I feel like it. So long story short, You will stop playing it if you actually want to. Just think about all the amazing things that you can do in the time you spend on gaming and start spending time on the other things that you love. May the force be with you :) ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. I have been in your shoes, especially during high school and university. Good times playing many PC and console games. But when I got older and got married, responsibilities came knocking at the door. I have my own family and have to pay the bills for electricity, Internet, etc. And of course, put the foods on the table (or fridge, whichever you prefer). Seems like a drastic change of pace, but that is life for you. Welcome to the cold, hard facts of reality. But don\u2019t let reality makes you grim. I realize that deep inside me I still love gaming. Its just that my gaming focus shifts. Instead of playing RPGs and MMOs at PCs or consoles, I got to play a realistic RPG called LIFE. Its not that bad should you decide to play it wholeheartedly. You have character progressions, can specialize in classes (multi-class or sub-class if you like). But of course you have to gain EXP to level up your character, and gold to upgrade your gears as well as keeping maintenance of your castle. I like to think my life like that. As a bonus, becoming a gaming translator allow me to keep close to my love subject, while still ahead on the realistic RPG called life. And that, my friend, is how I cure my video gaming addiction. I play games for less than 7 hours a week right now, but as a level 38 gaming translator/blogger dual-classed character, I believe I have found my optimal build to play my life RPG ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Gaming is very addictive and people often find it hard to overcome this addiction. Here are a few tips to overcome your addiction:  1) Time yourself Record how much you play a particular game or games for a week. Not shocked by the number of hours you have been playing for? If you are a true video games addict, you could be playing for upwards of 24 hours a week. Think of it instead as a seventh of your week, three eight-hour sleeps (a generous amount of sleep a night by anyone\u2019s measure), or 16 football matches. That should make you realise all the brilliant other things you could be doing with your time. 2) Read a walkthrough of the game This might sound counterintuitive, because you are reading something about the very game you are addicted to, but it will almost certainly ruin the game for you and kill the addiction. Once you have read a step-by-step guide on how to beat the game, the fun of discovering new things and finding what happens next is completely finished. The game should become much more boring, as it will no longer hold any surprises, and the game will be over for you. 3) Find some cheats In a similar vein to the last piece of advice, search out some of the best cheats a game has to offer. Be it flying a tank on Grand Theft Auto, or unlocking so-called \u201cGod modes\u201d on James Bond Goldeneye, where you can summon any weapon in the game, cheating is guaranteed to break your addiction. It may take a while for the novelty of turning around the turret on your tank and taking off a little bit of time to get old, but once it has, the challenge of the game will be non-existent. And once there are no longer any challenges to a game, it will become boring faster than you can artificially boost your health. If you a feeling really advanced, use a memory editor like ArtMoney, which means that when your game is running, you can manipulate any numeric value in the game. Money, health and points will be at your mercy, rendering the game instantly less enjoyable. 4) Look around: are your friends real, or virtual? This is not to demean people who make friends playing video games online, or assume the character of the game they are playing so fully that their friends are virtual people. But it should not take long after asking this simple question to realise if you are a video game addict, the ratio of real to virtual friends will have slipped dramatically in favour of the latter. If you still do not feel like you are missing out, take roughly 22 minutes out of your gaming schedule to watch an episode of Friends. The next time you play a game, you should crave real human contact like never before. 5) Start playing games with your friends, not alone This may be tricky if having asked the question to number four, you find that the answer is you have no \u201creal\u201d friends left, but it is worth inviting friends round to play video games with you, or go to their house. Although you will want to play for as long as is possible, providing your friends are not addicted, there will come a point where they get bored, and they will force you to do something else. This should at least moderate the period of time you play for, and allow you to gradually reduce it over time. And if none of these five work, watch this rather zaney behavioural psychologist below.

            "answer_text": "In middle school, I was addicted to this video game called Realm of the Mad God. My family tried to push me from playing the video game, but that wouldn\u2019t stop me. It is part of the reason that got me into programming, but that aside, it often created a lot of distractions for me academically and provided me an escape socially. I believe many gaming communities are honestly detrimental to people, especially adolescents, if you spend a lot of time in them. I remember meeting a lot of people who idealized suicide and were very frustrated with their circumstances. I saw a surprising amount of racism, sexism, and homophobia. More importantly, I believe that most of those people were suffering from inferiority complexes and they often complained about classes and getting bad grades. Thus, for me to get out of gaming, I changed my mindset and told myself that I won\u2019t achieve my goals of creating positive change within my community if I stick to gaming in all of my free time. More importantly, I came to the realization that real relationships are more important than virtual, anonymous relationships with people that were frankly cynical and negative. Getting addicted to gaming will give many people an escape to real life, but in the long run, it will further develop into insecurities and potentially depression and anxiety.

Note: I am only speaking from my own personal experience. Many of my friends have had a good experience with gaming communities since they play video games for the sake of fun and are not addicted.

            "answer_text": " Accept responsibility. The problem lies within the individual, not within the game. No attempt at beating 'addiction' can succeed until the individual accepts its existence. The problem is not the existence of video games, nor the content of games, but the person who chooses to play them.Identify the impact. How many hours a day do you spend playing games? Do you normally go out on the weekend? When was the last time you read a book? Identifying the negative impacts of the addiction will help you focus on positive improvements and getting back the things that you really are missing.Avoid blame. Blaming others for problems that you alone must face does not solve the problems. The 'gaming industry' or manufacturers are not the cause of this problem, and blaming them does not make the problem better. The vast, extreme majority of 'gamers' are healthy individuals, accepting responsibility is the first step.Stay positive. While it is important to identify the negative aspects of the problem, it is also important to focus on the goal and progress that you have made.Set limits. If you decide that you have one hour per day to spend playing games, stick to that. Choose your games correctly! If you are playing a game that requires many hours of gameplay between saves or which is an open-ended game like many MMOs, you likely should consider a different game or different genre of games.Monitor your child's video game time. You are the parent, and thus you are in control. If your children do not listen to you, removal of the game console or setting of administrative control on the computer may allow you to better handle the problem. Look in your drawer of CDs. Are there more than 5 games that you have played in the last two months? Are these games open-ended (like Civilization, World of Warcraft, or Evil Genius)? This could be a warning sign.Add up the total hours played per week. This includes time spent reading walkthroughs and watching videos and discussing games in real life. Always round up! If this number is over 25, then there may be a problem.Request that your parents put you on a strict time limit for computer playing.There are freeware programs available for download that can help with this. Playing hide-and-go-seek with your parents (hiding your games) is an effective way to minimize gaming overall.Find something else to do. You know the statement \"my anti-drug...\" This statement is better phrased \"my anti-addiction...\" or \"my anti-bad habit...\" The best way to do this is to develop a variety of other things to do, with others.Credits: wikihow So, I hope this will help you guys and do checkout my blog - Click Here :p  ",

            "answer_text": " Source Google It is a common addiction which most of the people are suffering from. But, don\u2019t worry!! I have searched many times on the internet that how addiction can be stopped? We always feel bad when we listen to the word Addiction. Addiction is a psychological thing that makes a human addicted to a particular thing, Now, our topic is game addiction. It is often seen that if we engage our minds in a particular thing which makes us happy. Our minds force us to do that thing again and again. It happens with all of us. Let me give you my example. I used to play games the whole day when I was a kid. Most of the kids completed their childhood by playing video games. When I was 18 the PUBG game was launched and all my friends were addicted to it. I played that game too much. Then, a point came where I came to college and got engaged in my studies. After that, I never played PUBG again. How I stopped my addiction to that game My college hours were from 7 am to 5 pm. When I come home it makes me tired and after having dinner I go to sleep. This was my routine and because of this I did not get sufficient time to play games and it almost killed my game addiction. The moto of telling these stories keeps your mind busy with other tasks rather than playing games the whole day. I think you are a teenager and this time is to build your future not just wasting time on such things.  Source- Google Here are some tips to overcome game addiction  Source- Google Set time Limit: If you love to play games play them. But, set a time limit for it. We always set timetables for study but, never set them for improvement of ourselves. It is found that an average kid/child spend more than 2 hours a day in games Keep devices away: After playing for some time give that device to your senior family member and tell them to hide it for the day. Switch off your mobile phone or keep them away at night time.  Source - Google Discipline: If you make a timetable of using your device, you will get its benefits. There are a lot of apps which tell you about the time that you spend on mobile.  Source- Google Exercise or Outdoor games: Play real games with your friend like cricket, football or you can join the gym or take a walk outside which will keep your mind fresh.  Source-Google Reduce game time per week: It is not possible to overcome any addiction overnight it takes time. You just have to reduce your playing hours per week. Ex. If you are playing games for two hours you can reduce it\u2019s 20 minutes from the next week and repeat it until the addiction goes. Talk with your family: See in today\u2019s time children do not give time for their family and it is a serious case. You must speak to your family about your day, school, etc. Give them time.  Source- Google Find other hobbies. Start a collection of some sort, do some painting, etc. Something else to keep your hands and mind busy. Some of these you can also include your friends and family.  Source- Google Give value to your life: Look at your life as it is now. What could be better? Life is greater than playing games and addiction. Maybe you missed a child's event at school. Take those wrongs and try to make them right. I hope this information will help you to stop being addicted. I just want to tell you that please please play outdoor games or start running it is needed to develop your personality. Instead of playing games start learning some music Instruments or enroll in a dance club, it will feel you great!!! Keep Growing!! Thank you!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m modifying an answer that I had to a similar question on how to uninstall video games to be productive. I used to be an avid gamer, and am still very passionate about gaming. I haven\u2019t uninstalled any games on my computer (other than to free up hard drive space) What I think happened is that my priorities in life changed and I found more productive hobbies that naturally just took time away from gaming. I also started valuing my studies because I was interested in the topics I was studying in school I started bouldering, which is basically exercise disguised as a game, and many times where I would play games I find myself climbing. I started performing stand-up comedy. Writing and practicing comedy takes up a lot of the time where I would be playing games. Going to open mics is also another large chunk of my free time that i elect to use on something that isn\u2019t gaming. I found a job, which naturally takes time away from gaming, because you have work obligations and less time in general. I became interested in my school subjects because I found things that I was passionate and interested in. If you don\u2019t have these stimuli in your life and can\u2019t find any, I can tell you some other reasons that i slowly just played fewer games. Talking to friends, I noticed that many people have so many exciting interests, hobbies and talents. At a certain point, I had nothing to show for other than \u201cI play video games\u201d. It was a slightly embarassing feeling, and I vainly wanted to show off how diverse I am. This vain part of me motivated me to become better at everything. At a certain point in time you want to find self-worth in your hobbies. Whether you validate yourself or others validate you, you\u2019ll want to be someone you can be proud of. Now, in conversation, I can say all the things that I listed above, and even more things that I didn\u2019t mention, AND that i play videogames. I accept that video games are a part of my life, but I have so many other aspects to me as well. You\u2019ll eventually notice that the people who you play games with seem like they aren\u2019t going anywhere, and if you keep playing games with them, you might end up going nowhere too. You\u2019ll get the urge to branch out and do other things and have something to show for it. As I became less into videogames, I started talking to my friends that I played videogames with a lot less as well, just because there wasn\u2019t as much in common anymore. It\u2019s a bit circular. You choose to play less games, so you talk to the people that make you play games less, meaning you play less games as well. It loops in on itself. The people anchoring me to videogames were no longer doing that because I was talking to them less. As a result, one of the biggest motivations to play videogames disappeared. As I grew more distant from my friends that played videogames, I felt less pulled into videogames. A lot of videogames are social in nature, and people draw you in. Once you stop talking about it with these people, you\u2019ll feel less of an urge to play. As you branch out and find more things that you enjoy, you\u2019ll naturally spend less time on videogames. You have to want to do things that aren\u2019t videogames of your own volition and that just takes time and experience. Expose yourself to different activities and people. Find a way to make your studies exciting and interesting. Waste time in ways that don\u2019t involve videogames. Things that are productive and interesting. If it matters, I still play video games. In fact, I represent my university on the DOTA 2 team in the Collegiate Star League. It\u2019s fun, but I also do stand-up comedy, work, rock climb and am a full-time student. ",

Seriously, I even walked my dog as soon as I woke up at like 5pm-6pm and again at 2am-3am to speedway and back to get an oversized soft drink, it was the only time he got a chance to go for a walk. Now that I say it I can't believe how much of a piece of shit I was. Anyways, I realised enough was enough when I was just disgusted with the way I lived, I had no dignity and I didn't care. My mom was very neglectful to me and my siblings that she brought up which is a story of itself. So the upper apartment was always cluttered with dirty cloths, sink full of dirty dishes, fly's practically lived in the window sill. It got to a point where I woke up almost every evening to a fly buzzing around my face, and all I could do was play a damn video game. I wish I could say that I manned up and started taking care of the apartment, but I didn't. I decided enough was enough, I moved back with my dad about 3\u20134 months after and here's what I did to cure my gaming addiction. Got A Job - Get a job/go to college Started excercising/eating healthier - Doing this is kind of like playing a game, it's fucking hard and it's kind of like leveling up a character, takes time and effort. Learned how to cook for myself Started cleaning my room more often - this is a lot more important than it sounds. Jordan Peterson said \u201cyou have to put yourself beneath the trash piled up in your room in order for you to grow, a clean room is a strong base to start building off of. Got back into skating Started drawing/sketching more often In conclusion, just find other hobbies and jobs that would occupy the time you would usually spend gaming. Life is a RPG of it's own and you're the main character. Not that gaming is a totally bad thing, it's good in moderation. Every gamer dreams of a reality where they can make a living doing what they love, although not much have the balls because it's quite rare. ",

            "answer_text": "Gaming is addictive because it provides you with pleasure :) So a way to cut back is to think long and hard of what other activities could provide you with pleasure to the same extent or more. This is a very simplistic approach but it will help you. The important point here is to find other activities which would provide you pleasure but also purpose. You don\u2019t have to cut gaming 100% but just replace some of the time you spend gaming with other hobbies (watching movies, playing with yourself or doing similar things which only provide you some kind of pleasure will not help..whatever you like doing should also provide you some positive reinforcement, should add value to your life). I would strongly suggest a physical activity (biking, running, boxing, swimming, etc.) because this will give you lots of pleasure AND it will be much better for your body and mind in the long run. In any case, just change something today. If you play 5\u20136\u20137\u20138 hours normally, play 1 hour less today and in that hour do something outside if you can or inside the house, but something constructive. I wish you strength, perseverance and inspiration to find other things good for you! ",

            "answer_text": "This is a challenge no less daunting than the other kinds of addiction. In my work with young people and even some older folks who have this affliction the consequences are very real and pervasive. The heightened increase in adrenaline and eye and hand coordinated aciivity provide an endorphin boost which is hard to let go of. This emotional and mental escape from real world drama or drudgery combined with the physiological effects is very real and draws one back over and over. Sense of time is lost, productivity and sense of responsibility and even fear of consequences go down. Seeing students who have failed an entire semester or even resulting in academic dismissal over this type of addiction is heart breaking or maddening to those who don't understand the power of this compulsion who think \u201cjust stop\u201d. Much like any other addiction or compulsion the solution is at once simple and secondly neither easy or pleasant to hear. The only success I've had with addiction is complete abstinence. Know any \u201csocial\u201d heroin users? No. Neither do I. When I'm in the grip of a true compulsive malady I just want a little \u201cmore\u201d. Secret/not so secret: there's no such thing as a little more. If one is really not a true addict try some controlled playing. This might look like setting a time limit to play - say, for an hour. At the end of an hour - stop. Don't think about it anymore and go on to the next activity. A true addict probably can't do this. They may stop but can't stop \u201cthinking\u201d about returning to play or at the slightest provocation of a friend (who probably doesn't understand the corrosive and damaging results of addiction) saying \u201ccome on, just one more level or game\u201d, immediately returns to playing without the ability to say \u201cno, I'm going to go study/do something else\u201d, Vows to quit or moderate play are repeatedly made and broken and before one realizes its become one of the primary focal points of everyday living all the time. I once had my husband say \u201care you even going to take a shower? Or change out of your pajamas?\u201d And when I responded \u201cin a second\u201d and he pointed out it was 10pm (I had been playing since 9am) I realized how transfixed I'd become and how time, eating, sleeping, hygiene, nothing mattered when I was immersed in this other (and when in that state, I would have argued \u201cbetter/more fun\u201d world). So if one is a true video game addict it's not likely they can moderate or even play a little without getting sucked back in completely. There is, unfortunately, no middle of the road solution. Particularly for young people this is especially challenging because it's what their peers want to talk about and it can be a central point of socializing with friends. I wish you or anyone you know who might be afflicted the best. Take care and if we come across one another let's have a beverage or enjoy a nice walk outside (or anything productive) instead. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Video gaming is great fun but getting addicted to it is a problem. From my own experience, I used to be like crazy about videogames.(It all started from the first gaming console I got when I was 12).It was my all time favourite pastime. Now I have curbed my addiction very effectively. Now I play video games less than 1.5hrs a day.(earlier it used to be like 6hrs straight, 8-9hrs somedays) Methods which worked for me: SHIFT OF ADDICTION: Thats a new approach! I deliberately tried out other stuffs which interested me, for example-quora. I devoted more time to it and slowly gaming took a backseat.Eventually addiction shifted for good. You can take up any hobby like writing, painting, reading for that reason.(but dont get into some other addiction which is more harmful. Be careful here) KEEPING AWAY FROM GAMING LAPTOP: Yes, you heard it right. I kept laptop off and out of sight for few hours a day, initially then for full days. Also uninstalled most games.(here the trick is, the fewer games limits playing hours, particularly if you tend to play multiple games in a session). Let me tell you, it worked well. DONT TALK/DISCUSS ABOUT GAMES: The moment you get to hear about the latest game update which adds some much awaited features in that AAA title, you wont be able to resist playing that game. So its crucial that you avoid talking/reading anything related to gaming. READ ABOUT ILL EFFECTS OF GAMING ADDICTION: Am sure you will find plenty on the internet. This should make you aware of the dark side of the coin. Atlast I would say, its upto you to break your addiction before it gets worse. Its a commitment for your own good. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Seriously there is no need of getting out of gaming. Only thing is to limit the time you spend on playing game. It increases your problem solving skill and logic. It improves your hand-eye coordination and your ability to multitask. If you are interested in positive effect of video game. Watch this:  But to your question, if video games has hampered a lot in your daily life and obstructing with your daily schedule and you are serious in getting out of gaming. Then: Realize how it is harming you:- Either your grade may be suffering and you may be going through some sort of physical pain. In most, you may be diminishing your productive time.Make a list of things of your priorities:Namely, this is to put your addiction into focus. Don't make a list of what your priorities should be, but what they actually are. If you have problems deciding how high of a priority something is, look at what you've done in the past.When you had a chore to do, did you get up and do it or did you wait until you got one last level?When your friends wanted to hang out, did you want to go with them or did you want to stay home and play?When you brought your homework home, did you do it right away or did you get on the computer and play until the last minute.This will give you a sense of how many hours you are wasting on it. 3. Keep things out of your sight: Its time to take action. You may be a mobile gamer, pc gamer or a console gamer. So, to get out of this only thing you can do is just pack them up. Delete all your games from the pc. Uninstall in case of phone. Give all the disk of your console to other. And just focus on your priorities.And finally having a strong motivation is necessary. But I am again telling there is no need to stop gaming just limit the time you play and spend other time on productive activities. ",

            "answer_text": "The same way you deal with any addiction\u2026 Through addiction therapy/counseling. You need to educate yourself on what addiction is, so you can better understand what's going on with you, and how to deal with it. Addiction is like any most any mental illness, and is not \u201c curable\u201d, rather it's \u201ctreatable\u201d. Finding a good mental health & addiction therapist, is the best thing you can do, to start understand and treating your addiction. Regardless of whether it's drugs, gambling, gaming, hoarding, sex, food, whatever the case may be, addiction is medically the same. There are many underlying factors that push people into whatever things they may get into, but no matter what you wind up getting into, it's important to understand that you were an addict before you got into whatever you are addicted to\u2026 Your brain chemistry was already the way it is, and that's what people don't get. There are health issues with some things people get into, like physical dependence with drugs, weight issues, diabetes, heart disease, etc., with food, STDs with sex, and so on, but those are just side effects of what you're using/doing, not addiction itself\u2026 This is where many get things confused, especially with drug addiction, confusing the symptoms for the disorder. Find a good therapist, and join a group for gaming addicts (there are groups for everything). I find a group of like-minded people, supporting each other in their recovery, is extremely important in battling addiction. Make sure to work on your mental health issues too, as I found if you suffer from other mental health issues, aside from addiction, it's ALMOST impossible to succeed in addiction recovery, if you neglect the other issues. Good luck! ;-) ",

I checked my bank account and I was shocked that I had spent more than two thousand dollars for gaming then I thought that I could have spent for better things.I no longer watched game reviews on youtube and avoid the game forum which was very hard for me because I had a lot of friends in that forum.I no longer subscribed premium account. I still play WOT but no longer buy premium tanks or golds.I forced to make myself realize that by having more than 50 premium tanks, it did not help me becoming better player in the game.I found a better social media, which is Quora where I could write or read things which is off course better than playing WOT for 7 hours. I found many articles in Quora which helped healing my addiction.I hang out. I already have a steady job but during my addiction period, I used to spend my whole weekend sitting down before my PC to play WOT, now I regularly hang out at local community around my house and it helps me to keep my mind from thinking about games.I have reduced my gaming time.The point is, you must realize that you live in reality and not in virtual world.

            "answer_text": "Let me start off by telling you that I am not a psychologist or an addiction specialist of any kind. I have however been addicted to drugs and did have an arcade game addiction when I was young. I have been clean of both for over 26 years. I personally do not believe that you can cure someone else of an addiction. If you are the person with the video game addiction, I would say that you know what you do is a problem and that's the most important step for someone to stop their addiction. Addicted people need to know they have a problem in the first place. A third party telling them they have a problem just means that someone else thinks the person has a problem and most of the time the addict will not agree with you. He or she may start arguing with you and not be remotely close to coming to the conclusion that they have a problem at all. They will either fight you or take flight. So what can you do? Depends on what type of relationship you have with the addict. In my case, I hid my addiction from everyone and almost died before I got the message. If you are a friend, be sure the addict really knows that you care for them. Don't nag at them or do anything to trigger their impulse to fight or run. My suggestion is to find openings where you can put a thought in their head that they may have a problem. If the addict is going to school, when his grades slip, you might want to ask them if they have any idea what they want to do after school is over. If they are a young adult, you can ask them what career they may want to pursue in the future. Basically you want them to start thinking about things where their gaming addiction will get in the way of their future and potential goals. They need to come to the conclusion that gaming will impede them greatly in getting what they want. If they still don't get it, you might need to let them hit rock bottom and pick themselves up. This is probably not the answer you were looking for\u2026 ",

Your mind is driven by simple pleasures and it is hungry for those happy chemicals to release every now and then especially if you\u2019re a teenager, it is easy to get addicted to something and very hard to get out of it. I hope to give you a practical solution for your gaming addiction, keep reading.   If you\u2019re a teenager it is obvious that you are studying in a school or college and you want to build your career out of it so that you won\u2019t be dependent on someone for your entire life, right? A little bit of gaming is important for your mind to refresh but if it is affecting you\u2019re grades isn\u2019t it a problem? Here\u2019s what you should do. Set a timetable - setting a timetable can be really good for you to balance your studying and entertainment ( Not just gaming you should also include some physical exercise, outdoor games)Keep gaming as a reward - so let\u2019s say you have a test tomorrow, and you want to study a few lessons. So say it to yourself that you will complete you\u2019re studies first and you\u2019ll get a reward of gaming for 2 hours that dayTips : get a countdown chrome extension that will show you a timer of when you can start gaming after completing your workDownload SERENE chrome extension that blocks distracting websites and shuts down distracting applications on your pc. so you can temperorily shut down your games and keep a countdownUnderstanding why you are doing all of this is the point. unless and until you dont realise why do you want to stop this addiction and study it is pointless to ask the question and me here answering it. It is the first step of all. Your mind should be ready to take the pain of studying first and then take the pleasure of gaming. trust me, getting the pleasure of gaming is next level after you have taken the pain of studying.It just takes 20 days for you\u2019re body and mind to make a habit and to get rid of a habit - so the initial days would be really difficult for you, Follow this for 20 days and you\u2019re good to go. you\u2019ll never open your PC or console before studying. I really hope this answer helps. Keep going, Keep growing. Thank you! ",

            "answer_text": "This is hard. It is not easy. I have been playing games since I was 7 years old. Today, at the Age of 26 I can tell you that I lost the habit of playing games every know and then. I was addicted to Dota 2 I would play every night for as long as I could be awake. I took my love for being a gamer and turned it into a profession. Today I have so much work at office and home that I don\u2019t have time to play games (I am not sad about it but I am happy as instead of just playing the game, I am making it). Playing games is a luxury for me and now that I don\u2019t play it regularly, I appreciate the short time spent on it than wasting every single day on it. When you feel like playing Video Games, try to learn something or work on something you like. Just get away from a surrounding where games are discussed and you will be fine. There is also another way of getting out of it that I had given to my friend is, (if you\u2019re of legal working age) stop taking free meals from your family. Consider it a task that if you\u2019ve only done something to earn it only then will you have the meal or you don\u2019t deserve it. It is very harsh but it changed the minds of people as you start seeing that the meal doesn\u2019t come from nowhere and someone is working hard to get it. Get a part time job, or help someone in your family with work and you will learn a lot and they will appreciate too. I hope this helps you focus on your life than on Video Games. Remember video games are not bad, they\u2019re there to entertain you when you\u2019ve worked hard to have some time to entertain yourself. ",

I\u2019ve been a gamer *AND* a responsible adult for more than 30 years. There are two things you should do: If you want to play games, play them but then don\u2019t watch TV or movies. Gaming is, IMO, a valid entertainment alternative. I never got people who spend six hours watching TV saying that playing video games for two hours is a waste of time.LIMIT YOUR PLAY TIME, by force if necessary. If a game has parental controls, turn them on and type a random password that you won\u2019t remember so you can\u2019t turn them off. Set the game to let you play for an hour or two at most. If a game doesn\u2019t have parental controls, then still limit yourself.Use gaming as a REWARD for accomplishing your other tasks. For example, I don't call in sick to work to play games, but *do* reward myself with an hour of gaming before dinner *after* work is done. The key, really, is to just stop after a certain amount of time NO MATTER WHAT. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve played video games my whole. I love them. I can get lost in them. So, I have struggled with this. My answer is: find a challenge that you as as passionate about and focus on overcoming it. Now, the hard part, what would that be? Much of playing video games is about the challenge, persistence, overcoming adversity and figuring out a winning strategy. It is also about playing as a team with others. Stand back and consider what else would be a fun challenge that you can do with some friends. It could be a sport, making a vehicle, going on a long trip, inventing a new tech, write a movie or tv episode, record a song, making new friends or alike. Regardless, the keys to the selection are: You must care enough to win at what you want to do. Screw the obstacles, you will find a way to overcome.Know what it means to win and lose. Always have a scoreboard.It must be something you have some skill in doingFind a group of people to be on your teamFind a group of people to compete againstPlan, make progress, improve, & repeat to level upDo no harmIn sum, find a challenge and start working it. For me, its coming up with new theories and creating related data visualizations. By the way, it is still fun to play video games even while on your challenge. I find it helps me along the path. I hope it will do the same for you. ",

Even today, if I\u2019m in a situation with nothing to do and nothing to read I might play minefield but that\u2019s about it. I will break this down into mindless idler games like Solitaire, Candy Crush or Minefield and Strategy/Action/Adventure games. A few years ago I tried \u201cSpider Solitaire\u201d in an effort to understand why many of my colleagues spent so much time with such games. I too found the instant reward rush quite addictive. However,it bothered me that I as well as other people would work so hard to play a game like Solitaire while neglecting something tangibly rewarding like actual work. I was being controlled by a primitive portion of my brain that couldn\u2019t distinguish between the insubstantial game reward and something in real life. I actually loved MMORG games and played several pretty intently. Here too I became aware of a odd phenomenon. My enthusiasm waned the higher I leveled in the games. Once I\u2019d become competent at the rules and playing and explored the game\u2019s \u201cuniverse\u201d, once I\u2019d accumulated enough wealth, power or \u201cleveled up\u201d I lost interest. I, and folks I met online, often \u201creset\u201d or characters to try to recapture the thrill of our initial playing experience. This effect was pretty universal across all the games I tried. Eventually I decided to devote my time to achieving tangible results. I play table tennis pretty well, which while still a game is good exercise and has sharpened my reflexes. I buy and fix up old cars and boats which has improved my mechanical aptitude and provided me with a lot of real world experiences. Spending time with friends and new acquaintances, having intelligent conversations (at least I like to think so) has provided me with rich human interactions that computer programs can only obviously mimic by comparison.

            "answer_text": "As written in Wikipedia: In May 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) declined to include video game addiction in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, concluding that there was insufficient evidence to include it as an official mental disorder. They went on to write: However, proposed criteria for \"Internet Gaming Disorder\" were included in a section called \"Conditions for Further Study.\" The World Health Organization included \"gaming disorder\" within the 11th revision of its International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems as of June 2018. Mental health professionals are still trying to understand how to categorize and describe the habit-forming characteristic of playing video games along with what happens to the human brain after prolonged exposure to video game play. Some people compare playing video games to nicotine or alcohol, but this is a poor comparison because those are chemical substances to which people become physically addicted. There are many habit-forming activities of which video game-playing is only one. There are people who show the same type of obsessive behavior toward: their work (workaholics), collecting things (hoarders), reading, writing fiction, binge-watching TV, etc. The cure for each one of these is to make an effort to perform the activity in moderation. Limit the amount of time you spend playing video games. If you find that you cannot do this, and playing video games is disrupting your life, then you must stop completely. In this way, playing video games would be like smoking or drinking. Those who can\u2019t do it moderately should stop. ",

Use a library computer or parents computer for homework if you need to. When you feel you're back in touch with reality (you will know, becuase you will simply be happy and living and busy) then you know you are back in control. Reward yourself with video games after your responsibilities are taken care of. Don't blow off things that need to be done for instant gratification of gaming. I know, at first this sounds ridiculous and excessive, but I promise if you follow through you will be so much happier. I say this as an avid gamer- for my whole life-, as someone who has gone through the same thing. As a successful, responsible\u200b, happy adult, that can now manage gaming with my life. Games are awesome, but sometimes they take over our life, and sometimes we have to reset and assess reality, and understand where games stand on the scale of importance in our life. Don't let yourself be controlled by them, take back control of your life, and when you get back to them, have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t really need to turn back but you need to gradually bring your daily gaming hours in the \u2018normal range\u2019. Some possible ways are: Spend more time with your friends and family. Start socializing, and start hanging out with friends rather than playing with them online.Stop making gaming as a priority. Give more importance to school/College (if you are a student), or give more importance to work rather than games.Play sports! I\u2019m not talking about e-sports, but I am referring to real sports like basketball, tennis, badminton or any other sports you like. This will vastly improve your physical health as well as mental health, because team sports helps to learn qualities like teamwork and it will boost your confidence as well.There are a lot more things you could do apart from the above listed points. All you have to do is move your attention from gaming and shift that to something productive. You will definitely have some\u2019withdrawal symptoms\u2019 as you said you are addicted to gaming, but as long as you are confident, it won\u2019t be a problem. Also, don\u2019t stop gaming. Gaming is not harmful as long as it is done in its limits and other important stuff is not sacrificed because of it. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Video games is one of the biggest addiction of today's generation\u2026. WELL Let me tell you why I find myself perfect to answer this question because I have started gaming on PC when I was in STD II\u2026initially everything was fine but as the time passed I was seriously getting addicted to it \u2026I was getting frustrated when I failed any mission and started bunking my school just for games and the situation got worst in 7th STD when I forgot that night was for sleep as for me night = games \u2026.\u2026and then when I passed my 10th I realized that I have wasted lot of my precious childhood in games and started working on it (the motive of this long story is that IF I HAVE LEFT GAMING WHY NOT YOU CAN) So now the question arrives how can you leave your addiction towards games \u2026. It is not a one day or two day job you seriously need to workhard on this issue ..it might take one month or even one year to completely come out from this addiction\u2026. Don't just stop gaming at once instead if that try reducing your playing time You should have a goal in your life and promise your self that if you complete your goal you will start gaming again ..yeah it's great pt and seriously works and keep you motivated (eg I have promised my self that if I cleared my NEET 2020 exam and get a MBBS seat in merit I will purchase a new ps5 )\u2026. because of this promise I have not touched my console nor my PC since 1.5 years \u2026. Humm I have written a lot negative about games let's see some positive side too. Games taught me \u201cNEVER QUIT\u201d They taught me how stay awake at night which is usefull for me now to study And lot lot lot more but since the QS is not about this I'm leaving it here\u2026.

            "answer_text": "Clearly most of these people have no idea what they are talking about. Basic measures may or may not work on you depending on your willpower and how well you deal with temptations and chores. Just buy some self-help books/audiobooks on willpower training and general mental balance. If you are in a position you think you are overindulging and you seem to slip more than you think you should. - You are having trouble with restraint. It doesn\u2019t matter if its videogames or cigarettes or ice cream. Putting an alarm clock or some other gimmick isn\u2019t going to frustrate you less. Procrastination is a problem not because people cant track the hours they put in \u201cwasting time\u201d. It's a problem because they can\u2019t stop even when it's affecting then negatively. I have never gone after trying to somehow get rid of the temptation. Entertainment is entertaining. And it always will be. Its certainly more stimulating that homework, washing dishes, or writing your weekly documentation at your job. What you need is not to try to negate entertainment\u2019s allure, but be able to deal with it in a balanced manner on demand. I\u2019ve done it in various exercises, with anything between dealing with irritants, habits, fears, fitness, and so on. You are human. You are creative. You mind will come up with excuses to do things, just as easily as it does find excuses for not doing things you want to avoid. Be very focused and aware, analyze your particular weakness and find the smallest step of training to strengthen yourself. I didn\u2019t like dogs barking. I\u2019ve spent weeks working on my laptop close to barking dogs. It took constant attention and emotional management, but now I ignore a pack of dogs barking whatever I\u2019m doing, and it doesn\u2019t cost me any frustration. Actively stopping irritation for a month has now allowed my brain to do its original job and filter unimportant things. Like you don\u2019t hear people talking right next to you when you are very focused on a scene in a game. There is no easy universal fix. You have to examine yourself and work with your particular strengths and weaknesses. Don\u2019t get frustrated. Breaking habits is not easy. Just because you slip doesn\u2019t mean you are not making progress. Getting off your \u201cautopilots\u201d can take months, depending on how deeply integrated they are. That doesn\u2019t mean you should stop. Gaining lean muscle isn\u2019t easy or fast either, but if you stop hitting the gym after 3 days of hardship - it's clearly not going to happen at all. Mental work can be even slower than that. I have even taught my wife of a very specific way to nag me about things. Now she can interrupt almost anything I\u2019m doing, and nobody gets annoyed, and things get done. Once you know yourself better, you\u2019ll discover all sorts of shortcuts to achieve what you want by creative means. I used to spend a lot of hours on an MMO. Couldn\u2019t get off. Always got pulled back in. I didn\u2019t have much willpower training at the time. But I exploited my own greed. I started doing risky trades, risky play, in the end, I gambled everything I had of value and lost it all. Gifted the remainder of my account to random players. This was highly unsettling, however, faced with the prospect of earning it all back and the massive grind it would take - I deleted the game and never went back again. This single move saved me thousands of hours. I wasn\u2019t eager to play games at that period for quite a while. Later I got better at restraint through various means, exercises, and books. You don\u2019t need to be in control all the time. Small focused bursts are enough to get you going in the way you want. Like parachute jumping. Once you muster the nerve to step out of the plane, the remainder of the way you just have to pull a cord on time, it gets easier once you jump over some barriers. Even if you do struggle with 2 steps forward 1 step back. ",

One can easily get hooked\u2026 Find replacements to ur video game habit\u2026 whenever you feel like playing video games go read a comic book instead or do any activity which does not involve screens.

The problem with playing video game is that it gives u these feelings and trigger various areas in mind which gives u feelof elation or satisfaction but it's just like sitting and taking drugs and feeling good without actually doing something in reality.

            "answer_text": "Gaming, like other behavioral addictions, is a habit of thought that is a stimulus/response cycle that happens beyond the awareness of the conscious mind. There are many habits of thought, mostly useful, and they are usually there because it is easier to have an automatic response to a stimulus than to have to think through a problem, if it is a problem you have faced many times before. Addictions are specific kinds of habits of thoughts where the person is using the habit to soothe themselves in a way that never addresses the underlying cause of the need to be soothed. This kind of habit of thought is not so useful because it perpetuates the need for the habit when, if you got rid of the underlying cause, you wouldn\u2019t need the habit. The process for changing a habit of thought, is largely the same, no matter what kind of habit of thought you want to change. Usually people embark on this difficult work because they want to change a habit of thought that causes a behavioral pattern that makes them unhappy or is destructive or dysfunctional. Habits of thought that someone might want to change could be an annoying behavior, a mental health issue, an addiction, or any other habit. The good news is that this process works. The bad news is that this is a process that takes years and will require that people learn many new skills and practice them over and over until they become new habits of thought. Common habits of thought that people might want to change There are many habits of thought that people want to change. Some examples are: Addictions to substances or behaviors,Habitual, dysfunctional ways of interacting with other people, such as passive-aggressiveness, or other poor communication habits, orMental differences like depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia.The process outlined below can be used to change any habitual way you behave that you feel like you have no control over. Any behavior where it seems like something is making you behave this way that is beyond your control. Addiction Addictions are habits of thought that people often want to change. There are two criteria for an addiction. First, it is a thought habit where you recognize a problem and apply the same already-made solution to it without thinking. Second this thought pattern, even though it solves the problem, must do it in an inefficient or dysfunctional way. One criterion for it being dysfunctional is that the solution causes more problems in the long run than it solves. Most addictions solve the problem of emotional pain. However, instead of fixing the cause of the emotional pain, these solutions are like pain killers. They address the pain without addressing the cause of the pain. Once this becomes a habit, the brain is quite resistant to making changes in that habit of thought. In essence, the brain has learned that a solution works, and it never wants to have to think that pattern through again. Mental Differences Mental differences are dysfunctional mental habits, more commonly known as mental illness. Dysfunctional mental habits usually are the result of experiencing more shame for being unable to think and act the way you believe others expect you to act than you can handle. This results in behaviors that other people think are unusual and potentially harmful to yourself or others. Psychiatry has given these patterns of behavior many labels, such as bipolar disorder, depression, Schizophrenia, Psychopathy, Anorexia and many others. It is important for psychiatrists and insurers to label these behavior patterns because it helps them conduct research and get paid for \u201creal\u201d problems, not ordinary dysfunctions. The conscious mind doesn\u2019t have as much control as it thinks it does It helps to understand the brain as made up of numerous different minds that don\u2019t always agree with each other. Most people think they are in control of their thoughts. They experience themselves making decisions about what to think. This is how the conscious mind usually thinks. The conscious mind thinks it rules all the other minds, so it believes that if it understands a problem, all the other minds will follow its lead. However, the other minds (often referred to as the subconscious, but I prefer to call it the non-conscious so as to refer to all the ways our brains process problems that we are not aware of) are not so docile. Some of them hang onto their way very strongly, making it difficult and sometimes impossible for the conscious mind to lead all the interior ways of thinking to change their ways. The understanding that much of our thinking is automatic, not governed by the conscious mind, is helpful when figuring out how to change the way we think. The advantage of habits of thought Our brains evolved to be efficient problem solvers. One form of efficiency is that we learn to recognize different types of problems. One simple distinction is that there are problems like problems we have solved before and new problems. We have evolved to identify problems we have solved before so we can apply the solution that worked before as soon as possible, without spending much of our most precious resource, thinking, as possible. The disadvantage of habits of thought. Habits of thought can save us thinking time, but when a dysfunctional solution to a problem becomes a habit, it can cause a lot of problems. When a person is addicted, they will continue to go to a habitual solution to a problem, even if the conscious mind thinks it knows better. It seems to me the conscious mind is more influenced by the other parts of the mind than vice versa. The non-conscious mind has so much influence over the conscious mind that it can subvert the ability of the conscious mind to see things clearly. For example, many addicts are unwilling to even admit they are addicted until the evidence is far more convincing than we ordinarily require to come to know something. The difficulty in changing habits of thought It is very difficult to revamp your thinking habits. Habits, by definition, are built in to our brains so we don\u2019t have to waste conscious time thinking about what to do in a given situation. People tend not even to be aware that they have thinking habits. The non-conscious mind responds to situations that it recognizes so quickly, that we do things without even realizing that we made a choice to do those things. We didn\u2019t actually make a conscious choice. We made a non-conscious choice based on recognition of a type of problem that our brains solved long ago. Habits of thought developed over many years. They are a thought path that is followed over and over. Each time the path is followed, the connections between the neurons involved in that pattern of thought get stronger. Just as ancient footpaths eventually become superhighways to accommodate the traffic, neuronal connections of our thought habits become so strong that they are part of the infrastructure of our minds. We take them for granted. They are no longer a matter of discussion. An addiction is a thought superhighway that goes in circles, never getting you to the place you wanted to go. For most of the time we drive along these superhighway, we think we are getting somewhere other than back to the same place, over and over. How can we change habits of thought? The way to change habits of thought is by slowly working at it, step by step. We will have to uproot our thought \u201csuperhighways,\u201d and then rebuild them so that they take us to where we want to go more directly. We will have to work at it over time \u2014 maybe not as much time as it took to build and reinforce the habit \u2014 but still, a long time. It is a matter of years of sustained effort. The importance of getting the conscious mind to recognize it has no control over habits of thought The effort to change addictions will not work as long as the conscious mind thinks it is in control. The conscious mind hates the thought of giving up the belief that it controls all of the mind. The conscious mind holds onto the idea that it is in control ferociously. It seems completely against our ordinary experience to believe we are not in control of our thoughts. Yet, if that is the truth, then using the conscious mind to guide the process of changing thought habits isn\u2019t going to work. So, the first step is to recognize you (your conscious sense of self) have no control over this thought habit. This goes against pretty much everything you\u2019ve probably ever been taught or experienced about your thinking. However, to actually change thought habits, you have to change the parts of the mind that are actually controlling the way you behave \u2014 the non-conscious mind. As long as the conscious mind thinks it is in control, you will try and try to fix your addiction and you will fail, over and over, which can make things worse. When the conscious mind can\u2019t control your behavior, it thinks it is doing something wrong. It tries and fails, tries and fails. Eventually the conscious mind breaks, and blames itself for being unable to do this thing. The blame turns into shame, where the conscious mind starts beating on itself, thus making you feel like you are incapable and stupid. Thinking these kinds of thoughts about yourself over a long period of time can easily make you fall into a deep depression, where you are completely ashamed of yourself because your conscious mind can\u2019t control the rest of your mind. The shame gets worse and worse the more your conscious mind fails, and eventually, you find yourself thinking you are a worthless human being who should die. How to get the conscious mind out of the way I\u2019ve seen people get their conscious minds out of the way in several different ways. Some manage to argue themselves into this realization. They somehow find a way to convince it it has no control. Some are forced into it when the cognitive dissonance of constant failure gets so great, that the conscious mind breaks and is forced to give up. Yet others find ways to experience the quieting of the conscious mind, and eventually they learn to be able to quiet it almost at will. To convince your conscious mind that it that it has no control, you may try arguing yourself into the belief you have no control, but that may not work. That\u2019s kind of like trying to learn how to play the piano by reading a book. You will understand the theory, but until you have the experience, you can\u2019t really know what you are doing. Sometimes, people are forced into this realization by the crushing reality of their failure to fix themselves with the usual tools. You may have to be broken by this feeling of utter and complete failure in order to realize that your conscious mind can\u2019t change you. If this happens, you may feel great relief for suddenly giving up the impossible burden. It may be such a strong sense of relief, that you will feel as if the proverbial weight has been lifted from your shoulders. If this happens, it will probably be quite recognizable because it will be such a clear feeling. I suppose this might happen without such a powerful sense of relief, but I doubt it. Another way to get your conscious mind out of the way is to work at it. There are any number of practices that will help you learn how to quiet the conscious mind, and these skills are going to be useful throughout the work to change your habits of thought. Meditation, yoga, exercise, activities that put you in a state of \u201cflow\u201d and other practices can help. However, if you work at it, I\u2019m not sure you will get that sense of relief from your conscious mind suddenly giving up the fight. I think there is importance to the conscious mind breaking, because of the relief that can bring. Working with the non-conscious parts of your mind When you get your conscious mind out of the way, you can actually start working on changing the habits of thought, or a specific habit of thought where it will actually help \u2014 in the non-conscious mind. The non-conscious mind is taught by practice without expectation or practice without judgment. Judgment is the conscious mind creeping back in. It will try to do so all the time, so you have to learn to recognize when it appears. It appears whenever you think an idea that begins with \u201cI should.\u201d It appears whenever you think something is good or bad, a success or a failure. Practice simply means what it says, doing something over and over. You must practice doing things without expectation or judgment. Eventually, if you practice enough, this will become a new habit \u2014 doing things without expectation or judgment. There are many forms of this practice. Perhaps the most famous one is meditation. But any practice that quiets the conscious mind so you can do things simply to do them and not for a specific result will help. Play really helps, because play is just to play \u2014 unless you start judging yourself for winning or losing. It helps to play games which are purely fun; that can\u2019t be won or lost. Other activities include exercise or volunteering. Exercise usually helps quiet the conscious mind because you get so focused on the physical, your conscious mind lets go for a while. Volunteering is work you do without compensation. The reward, if any, is in the doing of the work, or the response you get from the people you help, not getting paid in some concrete way. The point of all this practice is to gain experience with the feeling of being without your conscious mind always observing and/or judging. The more you experience this, the easier it will become to get to that experience. It will never be easy, but it will become easier after much practice. You can expect to practice this for the rest of your life. Finding triggers: identifying memories and events that cause automatic responses Once you understand this feeling of thinking without thoughts in words, you start to apply it to your life. First, you revisit your past, remembering it with this new habit of thought. Ironically, this is done deliberately, at the direction of your conscious mind. This is to change your attitude about the events of your past, and to reintegrate the historical revisionism into a different sense of self. You must investigate yourself in great detail in order to identify all the different kinds of ways that your past contributed to the subconscious problem and solution that you call an addiction. The point of this self-relearning is to get your subconscious mind to go back to each place or event that contributed to building your habit of thought, so you can prepare to consciously recognize when a current situation triggers that past, now automatic response. You will have to use your conscious mind to do this because it is the part of your mind that can analyze situations. You need to teach it to recognize when the subconscious mind is going on autopilot to trigger the addiction behavior. This is so that eventually, you\u2019ll have an exhaustive list of triggers in your conscious memory that the conscious mind can recognize. When it recognizes a trigger, you will feel the urge to engage in your addictive behaviors. Usually, we just give into the feelings, which the subconscious mind feels and acts on. When people start identifying triggers, they often don\u2019t do it until years after the fact. A therapist can help you go through your past with a fine tooth comb, looking for the first memory of when you felt a certain way. You then look for memories of the first time you responded to these feelings by fixing the feeling, not whatever caused the feeling. I think it is easier to do this work in a group of peers who have the same problems you do. Often, when other people share about their triggers, it reminds us of our own similar experiences. This is much more efficient than working with a therapist who doesn\u2019t believe in sharing their own experience, as is typical. This is painstaking work that, like everything else in the process, takes years. However, with a lot of practice, you can learn to identify the triggers closer and closer in time to when they actually happen. The sooner you can recognize the trigger, the easier it is the use your conscious mind to divert that subconscious response into something else \u2014 something, preferably, that would solve the underlying problem, instead of solving the feeling. Developing alternative ways to respond to triggers Once you are able to recognize triggers in real time, you\u2019ll need an arsenal of alternative responses that you can engage in at the direction of the conscious mind. There are two types of alternatives responses you will need to develop new skills to handle. The first set of skills you will need to develop are ways to intervene inside your head when you get triggered so that you do not resort to the automatic response of fixing the feeling caused by the problem, but not fixing the problem. The second is to identify the real problem causing the triggers, and learn how to solve that by fixing the problem instead of fixing the feelings only. These alternative responses will have to be figured out and learned. Again, this takes practice \u2014 lots of it. Stopping automatic responses to triggers When you find you are able to be aware of being triggered even as it happens, you can start doing something about that train of thought. I think the most effective way is not to try to fight them. Trying to oppose your thoughts directly often leads into the failure trap where you let your conscious mind try to fight and fail and feel shame. Instead of opposing your thoughts, you learn to acknowledge them, accept them, and then move on to another thought. Practice gently letting go of your self-shaming thoughts. I like to imagine that I write the thought on a leaf, and put it in the river of life that I am wading through. The leaf usually circles back to me (as thoughts will), but if I let it float away enough times, it will eventually actually float on down the river \u2014 leave my consciousness. I then have room to think other thoughts, instead of constantly recycling the thought that bothers me. Hopefully you can think other thoughts that you like thinking, but at the beginning of this process, it is most likely that the next thought is also one you want to gently let go of, and the next and the next. Eventually, with enough practice, you will be able to free up space in your consciousness to consider thoughts that cause less harm to you. This is a practice that takes years to become proficient at. Give yourself time to learn it. If you keep at it, you will eventually be able to identify your self-shaming thoughts as they happen and let them go before they do much damage. At first, you won\u2019t identify them until hours or even days after they occur. You will have done a lot of self-shaming in the time between when you think the thought and you identify it as a trigger. But over time, the interval between the thought and identifying it as a trigger for self-shame will become shorter and shorter, and eventually, you\u2019ll be able to work on letting it go before it has time to do much damage. There are many ways to practice letting go of thoughts. Meditation is a practice that teaches this skill. For some people, religious beliefs help them let go of thoughts. \u201cLet go and let God\u201d is the slogan that twelve steppers use for this skill. Anything that stops you from thinking in words and allows you to access nonverbal ways of thinking will help. Creative activities are pretty good, because once you get into the flow of creating, very few people are able to hold onto ruminative or shaming thoughts. Exercise is yet another way. Solving the actual problems Actual problems are the events that cause you to feel shame. Failing tests. Losing money. Not meeting the expectations of parents. The list of things that make us feel shame is probably endless. We learned to cover over the feeling of shame with compulsive behavior (often called addictions). Now we have to learn how to solve the problems that caused the feeling instead of just covering over the feeling. Probably the most important alternative you will learn is courage. The courage is to talk about the problem that is triggering your feelings. It takes courage to talk to parents about your perception of their expectations and to work with them to stop triggering you. It takes courage to admit to mistakes and ask for help in finding ways to fix the mistakes instead of drinking away your shame. Equally important are communication skills. If you have the courage to raise a subject you are afraid of, but you can\u2019t get productive problem solving to start, your courage will be wasted. The communication skills are to help you negotiate a resolution to the problem more effectively when solving the problem requires cooperation with someone else \u2014 as most problems do. Other skills you will need are planning and surfing. Planning is something you can find out a lot about elsewhere. Surfing is about learning to improvise your way through life. The crucial part of it is to learn how to change directions instantly, when necessary; when blocked by an obstacle that is too strong to overcome. This is where you learn a kind of mental martial art. Instead of fighting things directly, you learn to use their energy to help you go where you want to go. You surf the waves and go where they send you for the most part, but also you are controlling how you surf the wave, always moving towards your goal. You will learn to not be attached to your planned path towards the goal, and eventually how not to be attached to the goal, itself. Ultimately, you will learn to appreciate the path or the surfing as fun in themselves, whether or not you get to where you thought you wanted to go. When this happens, you will enjoy much more of your life. You will completely give up beating yourself up for failure. There will be no failure, because you won\u2019t care if you reach the goal. You\u2019ll only care about working the waves. Installing more effective habits These new skills are nacent habits or proto-habits. Once you have developed new ways to respond to triggers, you need to reinforce these new proto-habits, and make them a part of your habitual thinking. You do this by practicing with people who you have hurt in your life back when your triggers led to addiction behavior instead of problem solving behavior. You must go through an exhaustive practice of identifying those you\u2019ve hurt, figuring out how you\u2019ve hurt them (where the problem solving went wrong) and then meeting with these people to tell them the mistakes you made and to let them know you are now working out a new way to cope with these problems, instead of using your addiction to cover the feelings. One way to practice your new habits is to visit people that you have harmed in the past, own up to the harm you caused, explain how and why you did it, and talk about how you will respond differently in the future. Meeting up with people from your past, often people you haven\u2019t seen since you harmed them or they harmed you, gives you opportunities to practice courage and communication and creative problem solving. Finding your passion So you\u2019ve given up conscious control. You\u2019ve practiced not-judging and acceptance. You\u2019ve identified your triggers. You\u2019ve developed and practiced alternative responses to triggers that address the actual cause of the feeling instead of just making the feeling go away. You\u2019ve developed new problem-solving habits and reinforced them. Now comes the fun part: figuring out who you really are when you aren\u2019t being buffeted around by all those shoulds and oughts and self-judgments, good or bad. What is your passion? What gives you the most joy when you do it? Again, some introspection is involved, but actually, by this time, it may be obvious to you what you really get a kick out of now that you are living with self-acceptance instead of trying to do what you think others want you to do. If it isn\u2019t obvious, keep on practicing accepting the guidance of your wants and desires until you find things you enjoy doing that actually solve your problems instead of covering over the feelings. When you get to figuring out your passion, you will no longer be living according to what you think others think you should do. Your thinking will no longer be clouded by that kind of thought interference. Now you can let yourself start to pay attention to your thoughts that are really yours. The ones you think naturally, before the shoulding interferes to blow those thoughts away. Once again, it can take years to become clear on your own thinking that you really get passionate about. This is when you can start working on your true goals. The goals you thought you had \u2014 the ones you think you have now \u2014 are probably not your true goals. They are goals to please others. Once you find your true goals, it will become much easier to work on them, because they are things you are passionate about and that you want to do.u Teaching others what you have learned We\u2019re now at the final step in the process of putting your addiction into remission. This is where you take your passion and align it with activities that help others. If you are doing what you love to do, and helping others at the same time, who is going to complain? Who will be unhappy? You will, at this point, have created new, more effective habits of thinking that actually address your problems and let you do what you love to do while helping others. Of course, old habits are hard to break, and you will never really be able to let down your vigilance. The old habits are enshrined in your memory \u2014 built into your brain by your past years of thinking the same thoughts all the time, and strengthening the connections between the neurons involved in these old thoughts. Even though you\u2019ve worked at reducing the strength of the memories and behaviors that became automatic responses in your addiction, and you\u2019ve found a way to respond differently to situations that triggered your addiction, the old thought patterns are still there. They will always be there. You will always have to be mindful of that, and so, it will be helpful to continue to use this method, over and over, for the rest of your life. At this point, you will be ready to use your passion to help others. You will be able to teach others how to pursue their goals and teach them to the tools necessary to bring their thinking into alignment with their passion. This will be fulfilling in itself, and it will give you great joy because your passion is aligned with supporting others. This helps you strengthen your connection to others, so you no longer feel alone or isolated. Getting support to follow this process One of the easiest ways to do this work over and over for the rest of your life is to do it with others who are doing the same work. You can share ideas and experiences, and provide understanding when an old thought habit wins out over the new ones. Others can help you remind yourself that you are powerless over this \u2014 at least, your conscious mind is powerless. Your conscious mind is of great value when it comes to building new habits, but it has no power to give up old habits. That\u2019s the work of your subconscious mind. The importance of patience As you can see, this is a long process. It takes a lot of practice to become proficient at these things. You have to give yourself time to learn. Impatience gets in your way, and is something you will need to learn to surf with. Acceptance of yourself as you are is a very important tool in this process. The more you learn self-acceptance, warts, depression, and all, the better you will be able to identify your passion and start to enjoy your life. Stories instead of debate You will come to stop judging yourself, and also stop judging others. You will come to realize that stories are what you want from others, not advice or argument. Right and wrong will become irrelevant issues. It will be moving from this point to the next point, accepting yourself and others however they make this movement, and working it into your path as best you can, without fighting yourself or anyone else. Being an adept Eventually, you will become adept at following your path and using that to help others, leading to greater connection and fulfillment and less worry about goals and success. Your life will be much easier because you no longer fight yourself to get anywhere. Instead, you go along with yourself. The work you need to do to achieve your goals stops being work and becomes play. Once you are playing your way through life, questions about motivating yourself will be irrelevant. You will always be motivated because everything you do will be aligned with what you want to do and who you want to be. Conclusion The process I have described will work. It will work for mental illnesses regardless of diagnosis. It will help with addictions of all kinds: addictions to substances or addictions to behaviors. It will work for any habit of thought that results in a behavior you want to change. These things are all changeable, but not by brute force. You start by coming to feel you can\u2019t control yourself. Then, when you no longer believe you are in control, it becomes much easier to rebuild your way of thinking and make it more into what you want it to be. In the end, you find out what you love to do, and it is so much easier to keep on doing what you love to do than to be fighting yourself all the time. For more information about changing habits of thought, as related to specific addictions or mental health issues, or for information about how the brain structure works and how to work with the different types of thinking our brains are capable of and that contribute to habits of thought, read my blog: Change Habits of Thought.

Feel guilty about playing games. I prefer to play in private and ignore relationships in order to play games. I go on huge gaming binges for days at a time. I play games whenever I\u2019m lonely or bored and I play games to escape reality and my problems. But I\u2019m not addicted, you are! Get off my back! No but seriously man. Unplug. Uninstall. Spend your money on a hobby that's like a game, but gets you outside. Like golf, or building and flying RC planes. That way you get the same stimuli like skill building, achievement, leveling up, upgrading equipment to be more effective, concentration, competitive gameplay, ect\u2026but in a healthy way. Something that lets you interact with people in the real world, something that lets you share with a girlfriend. Or lets you get a girlfriend, depending on your situation. Local rec softball and kickball leagues are really good for that too. gets you outside, and lest you meet people. ",

Each stimulates the hypothalmus - the brain\u2019s pleasure center, which, builds tolerance to the stimulant, and we naturally seek to recreate that stimulation with more and more of the stimulant. The methods that have generally been working for all forms of addiction are the use of support groups through a structured program. The 12 steps is pretty standard. There are lots of meetings happening in every city and town - at most churches, many community centers, etc. There are lots of websites describing the 12 steps - these steps are basically the techniques of centering yourself so you can gain conscious control over your subconscious urges broken into 12 generalized steps to work through. Get to a meeting. Keep going to meetings. Work the program. If you work the program, the program works. Unlike alcohol, drugs and gambling, eliminating computers and internet access from one\u2019s life entirely is close to impossible, depending on your profession. Therefore, you will always have triggers nearby. Therefore, you will have to always work the program. Always. If you claim that video game addiction is not the same as alcohol, drugs, gambling or sex, then you are at the first step - Denial. Stepping over that boulder starts the journey. Good luck. ",

This was a difficult time in my life to over come of being on a game system to feel like I was important in a world of a billion plus it felt like a was lost and unimportant to the grand scheme of things but I learned two things.

The key to getting over your addiction is to make sure you have no means to access to your games no matter what. To uninstall your games or stay away from your computer doing other tasks requires immense self discipline, which is lacking essentially in anyone who gets addicted to anything. So what you have to do is start killing every possibility you find to access your games. Try to find workarounds for every restriction you enforce against your gaming and then terminate that workaround then and there. Once you run out of all your options, wait for a month or two until you feel you don't have that 'urge' to play. That is when you are liberated from your addiction. You can then install your game again and NOW you can effectively implement other solutions like limiting your time, doing other tasks, getting involved socially etc. \u2014 I've been an addict and played over 2000 hours of CS and CSGO apart from several hundreds of hours more mobile gaming like COC and Vainglory at the cost of my education. But now, I have disciplined myself the way I described above and I'm happier and more productive than ever. ",

In the case of gaming is all about progression, pretty much what most not chemical addict stuff base on. Like TV shows, how many chapters, how many hidden stuff you know, etc. Or studying, the more you focus on it you'll get better grades, job opportunities, etc. These two examples are non-chemical external progressive addictions (how badass that sounds) yet their mindset in which they are based are totally opposite\u2026 Short-term reward vs Long-term reward. Pretty much, to change your gaming addiction, which is long-term reward, is trading it for another similar, which of course give you those lovely dopamina rush out of your progression. For me, reading, each chapter became a level. Finish a book, finish a game story. And writing about it, is showing off my skills, while also working on another *insert previous badass term * : writing. It's pretty much like habits, but I couldn't say that it works the same for chemical-addictions (drugs, alcohol, etc.) Although calling them non-chemical would be misleading as they work under dopamine release hence the \u201cOh, I passed another level\u201d as without it there wouldn't be much reason(fuel) to keep going. TL:DR: Gaming addiction is based on progression(fueled by competitive/goal hoarding ), so find something based on it and do it. (Working out, reading, writing, studying old school[for grades]) ",

Money lures us more than games coz its real. Then you will run after money instead of running after games.If at all you want to play the game for the sake of reaching certain levels in the game or for unlocking special contents within it which can only be obtained by putting in hours of hardwork into it, let anyone play it on your device who badly wants to play it while you do something else. The first point ( money making ) is still applicable in this case \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0eReplace playing game by listening to your favorite music which you can keep on listening over and over again for a long time.Think of creating new games instead of playing games. This will be more interesting trust me \ud83d\ude0e Get hold of Unity3d to start making games today!!! It is more addictive than playing gamesTry to draw your favorite GAME characters or collect game goodies like t-shirts , models , for example .After all , you acknowledge the game to be your everything then you must also be comfortable with these things without playing the actual game. You can also read about strategies in playing the game , discuss about it with other players or friends either offline or online. Do anything related to the game without actually playing itThank you!!! Upvote if you guys liked my answer... ",

            "answer_text": "For me, a big first step was to do some soul searching to figure out *why* I was driven to games. For me it's because I'm pretty good at games. Like in general. Not gonna be an esports star or anything, but I'm above average, sometimes being in the top few percent of players kinda above average. So when I feel like I'm failing at other things in life, be it relationships, money, dreams and ambitions, I tend to return to games as a way of soothing myself, reminding myself that at least with THIS thing I'm not just good but VERY good at it. So for me I have to try very hard to first establish what counts as \u201cgood\", as \u201csuccess\". I have to stop beating myself up when I make something lame, or didn't have a good joke to tell, or don't make as much money as my peers. I had to really hone in on what I wanted out of life and declare to me and the world that even simply moving towards that goal was a *good* thing. The second step is to simply commit, no matter how much you can see proof that you're making progress or not. Consistency is absolutely vital here, you gotta stick with something. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going to say what I've said in response to these questions before; you need to find some kind of goal to stick to. Think about what you could be doing instead and how much you could improve yourself, learning a new language would make you more charismatic and employable, working out would you help score a hot girlfrien(Or boyfriend or cat), learning would make you smarter and more interesting, etc. I use leveluplife to keep myself motivated, you mark off what you've done each day and gain xp to level up, as well as a buff to arbitrary stats, you don't earn anything but satisfaction. It's a great way to organise yourself as well, I know I've been falling behind on the language I want to learn and feel more motivated to do it every day I don't work on it, same for drawing. I'd also recommend thinking about the types of games you play, games like civ or overwatch can easily get you pulled into long sessions that spiral out of control, lasting hours. Either replace these games with something you can more easily pull yourself away from, or only play them after doing some significant work for the day. You don't need to give up games, and they can be a great break, but if you want to improve yourself (And gain a huge edge over people who game in their spare time early on in your life) then you can achieve a lot by doing these things. Also unemployment\u2019s nice and high where I live so that's pretty motivating for me to improve myself, if that's the same where you are then that's an amazing tool. As for sleep deprivation, that's probably linked to the specific games you play, if I play stardew valley at most I'll stay up and extra 20 minutes for one more day, yet if I'm in civ I want to get my nukes, even if it takes me one hundred turns. Also China settled to close to me and now I have to defend my land and also I need to improve my army and also I want to take over someone for their resourcesm, etc, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Addiction is often something that can't be treated alone. Most people need professional help. However, it won't hurt to try to cut back on your own. If you want to only play 2\u20133 hours a day-set a timer, when it goes off force yourself to go find something else to do. If you want to spilt it up your hours, set the alarm when you sit down to play. You will only have yourself to be held accountable to so it will be easy to make excuses to shut off the alarm and keep playing. Try making a list of things you need or want to do with the goal to do one a day (after the alarm). Also, start looking into other activities that might interest you that get you out of the house. Even if it doesn't sound that fun, try it anyway it's better being stuck inside all day playing video games. If you cannot reach your goals on your own, find an addictions therapist to help. ",

I would first try and have a look at what games / aspects of gaming are the most addictive to you and try to work out what is stimulating the parts of your brain that you are addicted to. A lot of modern games particularly modern MMOs or mobile games are glorified skinner boxes designed to be addictive as possible, be wary of games that require regular commitments and over periodic yet random rewards. Basically the idea is that as you approach a reward moment say earning a new level or completing a mission you activity increases as you approach the event, but drops of after since you next reward is so far away. My biggest trick is to turn more of my everyday life into a game, basic a gamerize work, chores, etc. so that I get the same kick from those activities as I do from games. ",

            "answer_text": "If you enjoy video games then stopping altogether will require a lot of self control, but here are some tips that I think will be helpful. 1. Difficulty: If you want to reduce the time spent playing video games play it on \"Easy\" level. I am pretty good so even at \"Hard\" it's not much of a challenge and frankly \"Easy\" setting sucks. But it is helpful when you have lost the interest in game and want to run through the remaining game just to see how it turns out. 2. Be Selective: Start playing only those games that really interest you. Watch a few gameplay videos on YouTube to see if you are interested, only then download the game. 3. Finish It: Don't play everyday. Choose a day and play continuously on that day. In my experience planning to play only one hour every day ends up it being 2 - 3 hours every day and not doing anything afterwards.  4. Mobile Games : Don't play them. 5. Multiplayer : I got no advice here. Just try to stay away as much as you can. Also you can do nothing and wait for something that catches your interest more than video games. Then you will stop playing video games without any conscious effort. ",

I will answer from my experience since i used to play League of legends upto 14 hours straight to now just checking updates and follow news related to it. First and most important thing would be to find something useful to do. Games are great way to relax and provide entertainment, but too much gaming does not do any good.Ask yourself a question what is it that you would like to do with your life. Invest some time learning about that and research how to accomplish it.Learn something meaningful.Start a new hobby.Read/Watch/Listen to News related to your interest.Ask yourself a question what are the good things you can learn from the game you are interested in and how is it helping.Challenge yourself to not play more than so and so hours (Specify the number of hours to play games). Reduce the number of hours after every few days.Plan your day and analyze what have you accomplished and what you could do to improve.",

            "answer_text": "I really like Dan Robb\u2019s answer as he talks about reprogramming your brain. Also, I\u2019m actually going through the same thing as you are and it\u2019s still a work in progress for me. When I went to an out of state college, I couldn\u2019t bring my computer with me. During that time I thought it was a perfect opportunity for me to stop gaming and do something else. So I took up martial arts for about a year. But when covid happened I went back to gaming and it was also the same time I stopped doing martial arts. I found that I actually really enjoy gaming but at the same time I also want to make sure I do the things I have to do. What you can do is this, take a break from gaming for at least 3 months or more. This can give you a chance to reset all the dopamine levels in your brain. Now how you stop gaming is up to you. You can give your console stuff to a friend and have them hold on to it or put them in a place where you can\u2019t reach it. If you\u2019re on PC, it might pose a challenge so what you do is get a laptop not meant for gaming or get a chromebook. If you can\u2019t do that then I suggest uninstalling every game and platform on your computer and get a software that blocks games. It WILL be hard at first but push through it. You can do something else like watch youtube or read a book. Or find another hobby. After those three months, you can then decide if you want to continue gaming or not. I got this method from a youtube channel called Game Quitters and I highly recommend checking him out. OR you can always try and limit\u2026 no\u2026 PRIORITIZE the things you have to do first. That also means getting rid of distractions such as gaming for a while so you won\u2019t be tempted. Do your homework and then you can game. Or play on the weekends. How much you game is kinda up to you but you have to make sure you PRIORITIZE. ",

            "answer_text": "As someone with addictive personality behaviors - I\u2019ve smoked cigarettes often [and quit twice], had problems with buying scratch-offs when I was younger, have had a number of alcohol-related issues [buying it without a need, drinking it to excess], as well used illicit drugs [never anything harder than naturally-occurring chemicals that happen to grow] - I can say that the way I deal with gaming becoming potentially addictive (and thus, abusable) is by limiting the intake. After a game/match or two, I\u2019ll force myself to open a book or Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime and watch a show, maybe even go outside. It\u2019s mostly that addiction is a short-circuiting of our brain chemistry that we addicts (ab)use to feel better about ourselves that then becomes a deep rut, a place that is not only dark, but self-punishing and inaccessible to those around you - people that care about you and want you to \u201cbe better\u201d - and sort of \u201cleveling out\u201d that rut to be just a place that one goes to in order to enjoy themselves or have fun is the true endgoal, if not just being able to visit that place as one might visit a forest or go on hikes through a state park - just for the momentary enjoyment that life truly has to offer.

And the only thing that changed it was the fact that I started other activities. Video games can become an addiction because it is both entertaining and rewarding (achievements, leaderboard ect).You play video games because you want to be distracted. So find other distractions. It can be work, drawing, sport, music, art, ... I recommend doing sport because it releases hormons that will make you feel happy, because video games do the same and without it you can feel 'depressed'. I also advice you to ask your parents/friends for help. It can be as simple as hiding your devices. You only need something like two months. A nice break can really help you. ",

            "answer_text": "Playing or not playing is your decision. They make those games addictive intentionally. It is supposed to be hard to put down. Asking the question indicates that you do still want to play the game. When the desire to quit becomes greater than the desire to play, you will quit. Quitting means deleting the game from your phone and not looking at it. That is, at the same time, very simple, and very difficult to do. The decision to play doesn't happen when you start playing, it happens when you don't delete the game. If you want to stop, delete it, right now. Upvote this, and then delete the app. If you spend time thinking about it, you probably won't do it. You already have reasons not to play, you know that you want to want to quit, but you haven't done it, because you are hooked. Just quit. When you start to think of the game, instead of re-installing it, think about why you deleted it, and talk to a friend, or smell the flowers, or do your homework, kiss someone, go to the gym, eat a cookie, do whatever it is that you want to be doing instead of poking your phone. Do you really want to quit? ",

It is key to build on any motivation that you may have and keep it going strong. Also find something else to do instead. It wont be as enjoyable as the games for a while but you will make new good habits if you stick with it. Keep the games far away from you especially during times when you know that you will be most tempted and get some support from someone who cares about you. Dont give up if you make some mistakes along the way, overcoming any addiction is a process that takes time. Do everything in your power to stay motivated and avoid getting discouraged. You will learn to really enjoy all the new time you have once you kick the game habit as video games can really take up a lot of time better used doing more useful and beneficial things.

There are many disadvantages of video games such as completely immersing in them forgetting everything else, weight gain and being a couch potato. However completely quitting video games might not be advisable as straight away quitting an addiction isn\u2019t healthy, reduce gaming time substantially but still satisfy your gaming sensations from time to time. You should also double down on doing social activities and spending time with friends and family as their support and companionship helps a lot.

            "answer_text": "Gaming addiction is not something new; it has existed for more than the last 3 decades. Earlier, when there were no video games, there were traditional games like board games and card games, that required people, but it was not addicting as every time people were not free to play games.  Image Source: Digit.FYI As video games came in the picture, it only required single players, and hence, people started developing an addiction. Let\u2019s see how to get rid of gaming addiction: Start with setting up a time limit for playing- Don\u2019t overplay games, decide a time, and try to stop it when the clock strikes the time.Consider gaming as a reward for getting a task done- Take it as a reward, whenever you finish all your homework or household chores, you get to play games for an hour or so.Try developing a hobby that can be done outdoor- like playing sports like football, cricket, cycling, workout in the gym, trekking, walking, and music, etc. Develop a hobby that gives you more rush than video games ever did.Go out and make relations- Stop being isolated in your room, go out and make some good friends (not another gamer like you) who are from different walks of life, explore places and culture because the real world has a lot of surprises",

Alternatively, get a notebook and take notes by theorycrafting. The goal here is simple: Any time you fire up a video game, your mind will enter analytical mode. This replaces an addiction with a beneficial hobby. Attempt to displace your video game addiction with another passionate hobby. Practice healthy hygiene: sleep on time, eat right, get enough exercise, interact with friends, attempt to live a balanced life, etc. Set time limits on your gaming hours. Failing the above, there is the option to seek professional help. Video game addiction, while not a formal diagnosis, is very much real. Best of luck to you. ",

It is like Instagram/movies/TV series. Now the problem is these things is that they waste a lot of time and energy and the outcome is nothing. In reality you can not just simply avoid something. What you gotta do is replace it. Replace is with something which may not be as productive as studies but still good for you. Like?. Like a sport. In today's life it is very essential for us to excercise. So if you go to gym at 7\u20139AM and then play video game at 4\u20136PM then stop going to gym and play badminton at 4\u20136 . So basically you used those 2 hours. And you can do anything at 7\u20139 . In a nutshell whenever you want to stop doing anything bring another interesting thing which you like and is productive as well and do it in that time frame. Now gaming is not bad if done in limit , but most of us don't do it in limit and that's the real problem. Best idea would be to make yourself a person who can just do things in limit and basically have SELF CONTROL. But it takes time and experience to actually be that person so until then do the first thing. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "I am a very avid gamer and while I was by no means competitive or professional I would be considered by most people as a serious gamer. When I went to college I had a dream of becoming a competitive rock climber and guide. I had this dream before coming to college but wanted to actualize it by the time I started my freshman year. I had zero background in sports with the exception of doing some surfing for recreation but was never physically active as a person. To make matters worse I was a smoker and was quite out of shape. Yet in a period of 2 years I became a guide and climbed at an elite level. My secret was simple and commonly employed, I trained more than everyone else, and when I physically couldn't train I read on the subject, watched videos, and made use of every other resource available. During that time I could still play games but I didn't have time with all the training I was doing. My advice to you is to find a different hobby that you enjoy as much as playing games and devote yourself to it until your at a decent level. I know for many people there don't enjoy other hobbies yet I think this is a symptom of a poor mentality there should be a million different things you enjoy other than playing video games especially because other hobbies such as traveling or painting teach you skills that are infinitely rewarding.

They love gaming, but is that stopping them from hanging out with friends and family? No. I\u2019m also constantly trying to go into town in the afternoon and weekends with my friends too. What I do to stop playing video games, I think \u201cOkay, am I paying enough attention to my friends and family?\u201d If I\u2019m not, then I stop. Also, just because you can\u2019t play a video game you love right now, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not going to in the future (i hope that makes sense). What I mean is that the game is not going anywhere, its not going to delete itself, so you can always play it when you have nothing to do later on. This is what I do since I\u2019m a YouTuber. I focus on work during the week. If I\u2019m available in the weekend, I do my videos and recordings. Hopefully this answered your question. Scotty1231 ",

The latest research shows that people (or rats, etc) with any sort of addiction have chronic stress in their lives which is causing them to compensate with short term dopamine fixes from various sources. Try to spot the things that are causing your chronic stress, it is likely to be something large, like a bad relationship or job or living situation, something that your \u201cmonkey brain\u201d wants to walk away from but your pre-fontal cortex keeps suppressing/repressing. The effort that you spend, often subconsciously, to make yourself stay in that situation sets up for seeking some sort of dopamine rush that is *relatively* acceptable in your subculture. At least you aren\u2019t on oxycontin. Try getting out of your normal situation for at least a week, you might spot what is triggering you then if you don\u2019t already know. ",

I don\u2019t like online play, and most of the games being made today are made to drag users online to waste more money to buy things to enhance their chances in the game. I don\u2019 like the idiotic running around and shooting where there is no compelling story line to keep a mature player interested and emotionally invested. Like a good novel or a good serial show or movie. I play only single player, western style (not Japanese) action RPGs such as Witcher and Kingdom Come Deliverance or Uncharted or Fallout 4 and the like. But fewer and fewer of such story-driven games are being made because they are expensive, often $200 million these days, and if the \u201cblockbuster\u201d fails it can take the game publisher down with it fast. So the shift to online multiplayer, to suck money out of online gamers, make dumb shooters like \u201cFortnite\u201d billions of dollars. The low IQ set seem to love those mindless shooters and willing throw money into the pot to keep going. Is it time to quit? If you can, sure. But that\u2019s like quitting TV or watching movies or quitting novels for some hardline fiction readers. What\u2019s the alternative? Heavy drinking? :) ",

I think it'd work for you too but the only thing is it takes time for this method to work and you need to waste a lot of time in order for this to work. I honestly think this is the easiest way and you don't need a lot of will power which, chances are, you don't have, 'coz I know I didn't.

Another Quoran linked to a popular TED Talk on this question that reveals gaming can have positive ramifications. If the reason you want to quit gaming is because people tell you \u201cit\u2019s bad for you,\u201d then you might want them to be more specific. If it\u2019s impacting you as far as your social life, school, or health goes, there can still be a healthy balance between gaming and improving those aspects. After all, video gaming is as much a hobby as reading, running, biking, etc. Simply limit the amount of time that you play games. For example, if you\u2019re playing 4 or so hours a day, get that down to 1\u20132 hours. If you notice satisfactory changes in the area that you\u2019re hoping to improve after cutting down your gaming time, then no further work is needed! If I\u2019m way off and you have just decided to quit gaming permanently because it\u2019s a serious problem, sell your console/games on your PC. But make sure that you want to quit forever (or at least for a long time), because otherwise you\u2019ll really regret it. I would, at least. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience it appears the human mind can get addicted to anything. According to Psychcentral, one way to quit is to start a project. [1]I would suggest finding another project you like that is outside of gaming. Or if you wish to still deal with gaming you can do something related to gaming but not playing games. For example, you can learn how to code. You can use that same code to help others by creating a variety of apps that people use in their everyday life and even start coding your own game. Furthermore, you can set a lower play time and exchange it with another hobby you are working on. For example, in week one, you lessen your daily gaming time by half an hour. Then in week 2, you would reduce your gaming time by another half hour. And so on, until you hit a point where the time you spend gaming does not make you feel guilty or addicted in anyway.

            "answer_text": "In my experience with overcoming addictions, 12-step groups work really well for me. I did a google search for 12-step groups for video game addiction and several came up. Definitely check that out because it will connect you with others in your exact same situation who are now free from the addiction and they can guide you out of it. The other thing is that working the 12-steps will help you get rid of the problems underneath the video game addiction. Often people use addictions to escape life and numb out negative feelings. That's the real issue, not video games. As you work on the problem from the outside in and the inside out, you'll have success. And beware of addiction switching - if you put down video games without getting rid of what's pushing you to them, you might switch to porn, books, tv, social media, or other things to numb out. Fix the root and all these escape mechanisms start to fade away and you can start facing reality and maturing as a person. That's what I had to do and it's hard to do it alone. Good luck! ",

But I didn\u2019t know how to stop. What personally helped me was a change of my living area/environment. I re-decorated my room. I planned out how I wanted it to look beforehand, too. Then i executed that plan and just went for it. At first I thought it wouldn\u2019t help, but it totally did. I used vibrant colors, which I think made an impact, too. I then started to take up a new hobby to distract myself. I started watching anime and got back into drawing. I started reading more. Reading had a huge impact. I read books on religion, novels, autobiographies, and ones on philosophy. They changed my outlook on life, and even helped me when it came to decision making. I also started to keep a diary. I tried meditation and yoga, but those just weren\u2019t for me. One thing I learned was to try new things, and to stop having a pessimistic outlook on it. Maybe mediation and yoga will help you, you never know until you try. I would also recommend seeking professional help if your really dealing with some type of depression. But the things I stated above can probably help you on some level, they helped me a lot. I was able to take hold of my depression those ways. ",

It is just a normal thing. Try to avoid thinking about the game. All depends on your will power. It is not easy, but you have to do this. Count how many time you think about the game in a whole day. Busy yourself in others activities with keen interest. Change your interest and think about your life. You can also go out for a few days to walk around or get a tour package. Try to change your atmosphere, avoid those friends for some times whoes encourage you for the game. Changing atmosphere play a key roll in all scnerio. Delete the games from your mobile. After some days you feel the result. ",

I deleted the games from the hard drive (except save files), stowed away my games and consoles in their boxes.  It was also great timing that at that time, we had to move houses so whilst I stayed with a friend for the duration of my final year, I decided to leave my gaming stuff at my house so I can 100% focus on my studies. Before I put away my stuff, I was feeling a little burnt out from gaming. I did other things before I did this drastic moving such as reading books, learning the guitar (failed miserably), tried to learn 3DS Max 3D modelling, caught up with TV shows and movies, etc.  I'm not sure why you want to stop but if you're like how I was and you feel like you need a break from video games, do it like how I did. Take a break by doing other things. :) (BTW, I did this last year. Now I've graduated and waiting for my PS4. The burnout's gone and I'm happily gaming again). ",

If it's the thrill of gaming join a range and go 2x a week or maybe a contact sport. If its adrenaline then take some friends to ride go carts or something similar 2x a week.

I still have to relate my story of how I became so frustrated with gaming that I quit my obsession and have played only infrequently ever since. I have occassional binges, but only when I have the time for it. I had been playing NES (nintendo.) Yes, it's the ancient system that was the newest and best thing in gaming at the time. I had been playing for hours, all day long. A severe thunderstorm rolled in but I was oblivious to it. There was a power surge. I was ignorant at the time, and the surge affected many electronics in my house because I had the dumb and did not own a single surge protector. I learned later that I was in the first house on a neighborhood grid, too, so\u2026 It wiped everything out. I hadn't saved, either, not that it would have helped. I just remember feeling so stunned that I sat in the dark, holding the controller for several minutes. I nearly started crying. But then I realized it was a good thing because I had been obsessing over that system and it was interfering with my life. So, after our power was restored (4 days later - the entire city had suffered a blackout) I hardly even turned on the tv. I learned to love the public library and unleashed my obsession there, practically devouring every book my fingers touched. My reading skills have skyrocketed. The best way to quit is to develop a sense of humor over how ludicrous it is. ",

I know that while I enjoy videogames, I simply do not have the time to play everyday. Some things to do if you are over the age of 18 would be to get in school if you are not already and after class use the gym there. Exercise provides an amazing amount stress relief and will help you increase your self confidence, since that trait is often a problem for people who feel they have addiction problems. I would also recommend finding hobbies that require face-to-face social interaction or artistic creation. Rich friendships and seeing projects that you create are all really healthy things to get hooked on and can help anyone feel more well rounded as a human being. ",

Antcedent - Behaviour - Consequences. Easy like ABC. Every behaviour has an antecedent. Remove the antecedent and the behaviour doesn't happen. So if you have no access to a system on which to play a video game you will not play video games. This isn't necessarily a long term solution. You'd probably just end up going to your friend's house and playing video games there instead but\u2026 \u2026in terms of stopping a behaviour, removing the trigger that causes it to happen is a pretty good first step.

            "answer_text": "Yeah, I definitely went through a very bad addiction phase to gaming. As soon as I woke up, I\u2019d be on the console gaming until 2 in the morning - it was pretty bad. The only time I would stop is if I needed to do anything, if I worked, or if I needed to eat. What I did? I sold every one of my games. I know this is super dramatic, but it helped a hug amount! I had tonnes of games and I took every one of them to an EB Games store and traded them in for Visa gift cards. I ended up with $275 just from the games I had been given and bought over the years. (I know it doesn\u2019t added up considering I probably spent over $1000 on them, but it was a great gift in return for dropping the addiction cold turkey!) I\u2019m not saying it was easy, and I was anxious as I stood there waiting as the guy cashed in each game and added up the total in refunds. BUT Seeing as I had no game to play, and it wasn\u2019t like I had just hid them, I literally couldn\u2019t play a game. To overcome boredom I had to do stuff. I ended up going for a lot of bike rides, hanging out with people, and learning other fun ways to entertain myself! Now, after (3?) years, I have only a few games that I actually enjoy and I don\u2019t play them all the time. There are times that I get into \u201cgame mode\u201d but I am much better in regulating the amount of time spent on games (e.g. I\u2019m not playing from 10am-2am). ",

You have to have strong willpower to do thisControl the urge to reinstall the app - you have to stop yourself from downloading the app. This can be done by engaging in other hobbies or activities .Talk to your friends or squad - tell your friends and squad members about your decision and ask them not to invite you to play the game or talk about it in front of you.Keep yourself strong- you will be teased and laughed at for some time but you have to be strong and not indulge in the virtual world.Stop seeing anything related to the game on the internet- usually internet is our friend by providing the information we need but in this case internet is your foe. YouTube and Google is brimming with the content related to your game, which can deter you from your goal.Try to separate the reel and the real world- while excessively engaging in the virtual world, some people starts forgetting the difference between the two which creates a lot of distress and difficulties in the real world. Your relationships and future can also be on the line. Separating the two and accepting the real life challenges can help you quitting the game .I wish you good luck in coping up this addiction. Let me know if these tips were useful and you can ask for more if not satisfied. For know, this is it. ",

In my case, I dedicated too much time gaming, but after some time I found I wanted other things (have a nice body, a girlfriend, travel, enjoy the company of other people) but these things don't come without some effort.  Nowadays I spend like 25% of my free time gaming and dedicate the rest to the things before mentioned. I encorauge you to try to do other things, and maybe accidentally you found enjoy in other activities. However, if you don't sacrifice some of you gaming time and try to do something different, you will end some day living with regret because of the wasted opportunitties and the things you never did. Gaming is not bad, but any activity in excess is not recommended. Have some faith in you and your dreams, go out and you will find that leaving your comfort zone is in the end well rewarded. However, if you simply need to study, the practical solution is to uninstall PC games, and sell or give your consoles. If you don't have games to play is easier to use your time in other things. ",

My gaming addiction was so bad that my parents would physically take my Xbox, and hide it. I would not get it back for weeks, sometimes a month. Even though my parents tried to help by taking my game system, I would still get sucked back in once my parents gave me my console back. Addictions are hard to break.. most of the time we never break addictions, but just change our current addiction to a separate addiction. The best way for me to quit gaming was to work immense amounts of hours that I was unable to play my Xbox, also leave my Xbox console at home, and go off to college. This allowed me to stop thinking about it. This allowed me to have self control. I replaced it. I came back from school, and now I don't care to play videos games so much. Just remember only you can break an addiction. Nobody can force you to do anything. Find a reason to quit. Do it for yourself, and your future. Best of luck. ",

S/he must come to accept the addiction and need for help, and put in the hard work of recovery from their own initiative. The first step is for the gaming addict to realize that s/he is truly an addict; behavioral addictions are as much true addictions as drug addictions. (See the writings of Dr. Bruce Alexander for some perspective on this.) Then, you can support your friend if s/he wants to recover, but still the real work must come from the addict. For tips on how you can support them, there is a new site that will be up soon, called WeRecover, that has the goal of helping addicts of all kinds (drug and behavioral) and their friends/families. It should be up soon. 12-step programs can be really effective too, as it's much harder for an addict to BS other addicts; as a community, they tend to be good at cutting through all that to be both firm and supportive with their fellow recovering addicts. Good luck! ",

But you know pubg is flowing like a fever in India. One of my friends give me pubg and wifi to play with him. I played 2 match that day. After that I did something that control my pubg addiction. Due to exam and my parents not agree to give money, I recharged with limited net pack for running what's app because I was deeply very lonely as I spend most of the time in pubg. Due to limited recharge in my pubg. I can't play more than one match in pubg and some days I don't even play. And now a days I started my evening walks which was stolen by pubg. At noon I try to meet my friends and play one or two match at outside in the field then we play cricket or some time gossip only. To conclude, I suggest you to recharge with limited net pack. Try to say hiii to your friends in what's app, chat with them, ask them how they are. Then play PUBG if you want but due to limited net pack you can't play more than two matches. If you again addicted to pubg it's okk\u2026next time again recharge with limited net pack. If your net pack will be unlimited, your addiction will also be unlimited. ",

In China they have boot camp for kids who are addicted to video\u2019s. I watched a documentary on it. Those kids thought their lives had ended. Their parents were the worst people in the world. The psychologist said that they became addicted out of loneliness. Most of them were an only child and did not connect with other children. I don\u2019t know if it is the same for adults but I do know as a recovery coach, that CONNECTION is key for drug addicts trying to get better. Hope this helps you and good luck. ",

Sport? Maybe volunteering a cause that's close to your heart?

            "answer_text": "Hey Clementine Weber, thanks for asking me to answer. I have found addictions either get us something we like or help us avoid something we don\u2019t like. Are you gaming to avoid making friends? Are you gaming because you are all alone? Maybe you feel superior to friends that don\u2019t get as much time to game? It helps to figure out what \u201creward\u201d you get by gaming so much. Something that might help you break the cycle is to change the way your room is arranged, this might help you remember that you don\u2019t want to be gaming as much. I would also recommend that you do something that similar, but not the same. Learn about game programming or game design. Find out about strategy or tactics related to the game genre: like if you are into racing games, find out what racers are thinking during the race. The final thought that I have is probably the most difficult. Video games develop very few skills for the \u201creal\u201d world. At some point, you will want to earn an income and live in your own apartment. To do those things you have to engage with the rest of the world. Even \u201cpro\u201d gamers have to find someone to pay them to do what they do. I hope this helps. ",

You asked how to deal with the urge to play video games and the answer for that is very simple. You just have to identify the thing that triggers you, like you want to be on top of the leadetboards and want to become a pro player. This is some of the triggers. You just have to divert from these thoughts. Take a walk, Listen to songs, Watch TED talks. It may be difficult at first but soon you will learn to control your urges. Thank you! ",

Granted, they are completely different worlds, but they are similar in some ways so I was able to get our of it. Obviously, some games don't work with this, such as GTA. It doesn't have to be a book either, it could be some activity. Personally I don't get into it, but cosplay works for some people. ",

See, what I do suffer from is depression and anxiety; I have struggled with it for over ten years. Videogames have always provided an outlet for that. I have a job that I've been at since before graduating (got offered a position during the required internship for class credit). I get things done, pay my rent, feed and clothe myself, etc. If I have some time at the end of the day and I'm in the mood I'll fire up the console or PC and play for a while. Gaming is not the first priority on my mind, and my everyday actions reflect that. I do enjoy videogames and have a bit of an extensive collection, but it's a collection that has been accrued over a number of years, it's not like I can afford to play every new gaming title that comes out; I'd end up starving. So, whenever I do fire up the console or PC I usually play between 9pm and midnight or 10pm until midnight. Each week I can log between 6 and 10 hours of gameplay. When I get a new game that number may rise a bit, depending on the game, but overall my gaming habits are far from that of an addict. ",

Music is great(I'm self taught, you can do it if you put the time in). Writing can be loads of fun, I particularly enjoy writing from humorous prompts, even rc airplanes! If you like games maybe you could learn some computer science stuff. Khan academy has some alright intro courses and with products like the Raspberry pi and Arduino, you really have some options in the projects you can start. The problem with video games as I see it is that you can play them casually. A lot of people hit a speed bump with instruments for example, and give up. If you don't enjoy it no one will blame you, but you have to put the work in for some of the best hobbies. ",

If you want to quit drinking so much soda, start buying juice or tea at the store instead. If you can\u2019t stop gaming or watching TV, replace that with reading time instead, or start taking an online class to develop your skills. Or you could do what I did: start working in games. You\u2019ll be so busy making them that you won\u2019t have as much time to play! You just might be able to use your passion for gaming as a foundation for a new career. ",

This is kind of like asking about the best way to turn the moon into green cheese; it ain\u2019t happening. First, you\u2019d need to eliminate the technology that makes it possible. I was playing computer games before there were PCs. The stuff you can do with ASCII graphics isn\u2019t rocket science, though it does require some level of programming skill, and even programmable calculators can handle the code. That means that everything has to go (including Quora), so take away everyone\u2019s cell phones (smart or otherwise), internet-of-things things, personal computers, cars, televisions, credit/debit cards, basically anything with electronics inside or behind it. Second, you\u2019d need to eliminate the very human desire to be entertained, or at least their desire to be entertained by things. The word \u201cvideo\u201d is a qualifier that tells you that they are just a type of game rather than the set of all games. There is also the problem of a lot of video games (RPGs and whatnot) being mostly a mechanism for telling a story. Some of the earliest computer-based video games were just text (a story) with a branching storyline (very similar to the \u201cchoose your adventure\u201d books that you can still run across from time to time), while others moved the pencil-and-paper games like D&D to a computer that could do the dice-rolling automatically. It didn\u2019t even take long to get a decent chess game on a computer. So there you go. Eliminate both the games and the technology that lets them be displayed on a screen or something and you\u2019re set. Oh, yeah, and you\u2019d probably need to keep firing squads or something on hand to make sure that none of those gets reinvented. ",

Also, have somebody put a password on it, like a parental control that locks it down after an hour of use. My father did that to my computer a year ago to keep me from playing IO games, and it worked: I get my homework done on the computer, then read an article on whats happening, answer one or two questions here, and read some over dinner. Finally, let me remind you: EVERYTHING IS GOOD IN MODERATION. Not gaming at all is a bad thing, especially if it's something that you like.

Long story short: Bright lights, sound effects, and feelings of progression will help ensure that a person will play for longer periods of time. I can\u2019t remember where I saw it but I remember reading an article or watching a video that was trying to come up with the reason that so many people were deeply addicted to playing World of Warcraft. One of the things that was touched on was the fact that your character was bathed in a ray of light upon leveling up. So not only do you level up frequently when you are a low level, giving you a consistent reward for continuing to play the game, you have a cool visual effect that makes you leveling up obvious. The higher your level becomes the longer it takes to get the next one so the more time and grind you would need to complete. ",

It not only occupies your physical state ,but also your mental state in terms of: I have to finish these sets now, thus you created a challenge for yourself you wish to finish.

If you're like me and have a room full of collectibles and video game related items, you'll never survive your fasting. Maybe once you get out and do some (hopefully) amazing things, you'll forget about your video games. Remember, though, video games aren't the worst things to play every once and again. I wouldn't cut them out of my life completely, instead I'd just cut back on them. You're asking the wrong guy, though, because instead of doing my college work I play video games and procrastinate until the literal last minute, so take everything I just said with a grain of salt.

Work on yourself and find out what else are you interested in ? If that is better then gaming , then do that. The plan is engage yourself in all other activities and eliminate yourself from playing games. Fix a time and play such that you must drop it after an hour or so . E.g. : play an hour before going to school or tuitions. Attach sticky notes on your smartphone, laptop, pc or TV. Every time you see the note , it will remind you of your target.

This is all because you have not trained your mind to be more puposeful or concentrated for necessary things to do. The easiest but a long exercise to this problem is meditation. Not only you can control your addiction, moreover, you will start feeling more energetic, happier, fearless and a meaningful life. I strongly suggest you all to add few minutes in your busy life for meditation. But that would be a long time to get those observations in one's life. So to remove your addiction to games the first step you have to take is - uninstall the game with full motivation, then go & search for other remaining work to complete, try to get yourself busy in some work rather than wasting time in your phone. You can read a few pages, do some household work etc. And you will observe that after few days you have all forgot about the game. There is a scientific research which says that it requires only 21 days to adopt any habit or to lose a habit. So try to make good habits and remove your bad habits with little steps. Always keep yourself engaged in some good and purposeful work. THANKU! ",

            "answer_text": "Here is how I would do it. Step 1: Tell your bank not to allow purchases of games for 2 months. This can include blocking money sent to Origin, Uplay and steam. Step 2: Use every last bit of your time to play the games you are addicted too. This will eventually burn you out of those games and you would want to play more. But oh wait you can't buy anymore! Step 3: Wait! At this point being bored of gaming you will naturally not want to play anymore. It takes about 21 days to break a habit. So wait that out and then I can almost guarantee you will have forgotten about gaming. If it isn't over then wait out another week after that. Step 4: Profit??? Basicly what this is doing is naturally making you loose interest in gaming. But if you can't do it in those 21 days still wanting to play games your bank won't allow you to buy new ones. I truly hope this helped! ",

Firstly though, if you are planning to use these strategies on someone else, ask their permission first and make sure it's actually addiction. I would first uninstall the top three games you are addicted to, and try to go without them for at least two weeks. I would then limit how much I game everyday so I have more of a scheduled game time so I'm not on forever. I'd try to avoid watching gameplay on YT or any other platform, and avoid talking about games. I don't have anymore tips. Once again, I'm not the best person to go to about this, so I hope I helps in any way possible. ",

Do you put off work or going out to meet friends so you can play? Do you skip meals or stay up late into the night? Then you are addicted to gaming. The best way to curb addiction is to remove variability. Tell yourself that you can only play for this many hours a day (say 2 hours). Also tell yourself that if you exceed that limit and play for 3 to four hours you must play for 3-4 hours for the rest of the week. This gets rid of the \"just this once\" excuse. Studies have shown that this technique is very effective. ",

If it's an online PC / tablet game, get a friend to change your password and make your particular machine only way to access it. Time limit that access mechanism. If it's a browser game, get one of the time waster / browser blockers that keeps you from accessing certain websites at certain times of day.

In your situation I feel you need to get to the point where you can do something else you love instead of gaming before you sit there and study. Pick a hobby that you\u2019ve always wanted to do, make the hobby a habit, then after that we can talk about studying. For the hobby - try something that gets you out of the house a little or somewhere you are away from games. Good activities are sports, collecting something, reading, cooking, service, etc. After that put yourself on a schedule. Always start your schedule with being productive - studying or homework. Then go down the productivity ladder - hobby or games depending on the hobby. Addictions are hard to break so don\u2019t feel bad when you play games instead of doing something else you should do. Instead when you realize what you\u2019re doing - stop doing it. Don\u2019t finish the match or round or quest. Don\u2019t wait one more turn. If it\u2019s to hard to quit don\u2019t even quit just walk away. It will be painful, it will be mentally taxing, but after a few weeks you will feel great. ",

If you have nothing to conectarte on than create some new habits(good or bad doesn't matter).ITS OPTIONAL: If you use console or other divices only for gaming, then tell the peson you live with to pack that thing and hide it somewhere you never found. And also tell that person not to give you that thing even if you die asking for it.Thats all, do these steps until u forgot about gaming. *basically it takes 2 - 3 months if you have some important things to do rather than gaming. But remember one thing my friend GAMING is the best addiction of all\u2026 ",

Habitually, for example, you shouldn't spend time around someone while they're gaming, or you'll want to join them. And when you get an urge to start gaming, this needs to trigger you to remember all the reasons you don't want to; and without hesitation, go do something else that is engaging. Probably, you are having urges to play video games because there are other things you want to avoid, like studying. Just remind yourself of this: Self-control is a habit that must be maintained, a skill that must be practiced. Self-control separates the winners from the losers, the men from the boys, the powerful from the weak. Losing your self control even once, could start the habit of losing it many times, until you lose the whole \u201cself\u201d you want to be, in your life. If you remember this, you may have more motivation to keep your self-control ",

I had a massive video game addiction, but then I shifted it to watching shows like Sherlock and stuff. Then it shifted to anime and as I grew up, I shifted that addiction to novels. However, it\u2019ll be best if you can shift that addiction to studies or something though it would be pretty hard to do that. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Ouch, very familiar story :) I was spent all my childhood in the front of computer (mostly playing computer games) or in the front of the books. But when I went to University, I SUDDENLY discovered, that amount of my free time has decreased dramatically due to great study load. Nevertheless that, I really loved studying, it was so interesting - thanks to professors of my department. I tried to find new approaches to unsolved tasks and apply new knowledge to interesting cases. Unforgettable time. So, the answer is simple - try to find more interesting and useful manner of spending time. Most difficult here is to find that manner and not to leave it because it seems difficult and there is no progress in the first attempts. More difficult it seems - more interesting it will become later and more higher-paid job you\u2019ll have in the future :) Good luck! ",

Now, almost a year later, I haven't touched them and I can play guitar. Looking back, it was the best decision I have ever made. To summarize in one sentence, Stop playing them completely and fill the time you used to play them with something else you are passionate about! Good luck! ",

If you focus on competitive, fast paced games like MOBAs or online shooters then the reason is instant gratification. Basically we need to keep our lizard brains engaged and happy so we indulge in gaming, gambling, drugs and so on. To break the cycle you need to find something worth-wild in the real world. That could be any number of activities as long as they excite the same part of the brain. Think long and hard about why do you feel the need to game so much and what are you trying to emulate or replace. If you find that and fill the void with a more healthy alternative (both physical and psychological), you are all set. ",

What I do think however is that you feel your playing is a problem, which is another issue entirely. The best advice I can give you is take up another hobby. I always recommend taking up an instrument like drums/percussion. Not only does it distract you, but beating a drum is very therapeutic ",

You should probably also figure out why you wanted to do that thing in the first place so you don\u2019t place yourself in the same position (or can accept it next time it happens). ",

This can help you get into a habit of not gaming a lot at one time. You can also get incolved in some other activities, such as a sport or another hobby, so you pursue those hobbies as well, and that will stop you from playing to many games.

And when you game its all or nothing (start a game, you need to finish it as fast ad possible)? Then you should quit completely. If you count all the hours you spend an gaming, imagine what you could achieve if you spend all these hours developping a new skill, or reading books! Learn to code, create music, invest that time with your friends and family. You will feel much better because it will be quality time! Where will gaming get you in life? Nowere! Believe me, I know because I have been there. Good luck ",

Something like, \"I play for fun, and nobody on this game can make me feel that loss of control.\"  In sports or skill development some people are helped by coaxing the subconscious into working for you.

Now sharing the Beatific Vision of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit with the entire host of Heaven, they then begin to pray with zeal for my wretched soul. In practicing this devotion, I have eradicated my prime sin, which only returns when I fail to practice it. It\u2019s what Christ said about not trusting in the world\u2019s goods, but to seek treasure in Heaven. Does this seem ridiculous to you? Then let me advise you. There is nothing older on the face of the earth than the Catholic Church. It\u2019s organization and administrative world-wide structure make it unique within the world.
