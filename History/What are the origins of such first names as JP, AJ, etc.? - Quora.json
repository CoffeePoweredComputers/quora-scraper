            "answer_text": "They usually are abbreviations of their two given names. JP might very well be for John Paul, AJ for Adam Joseph, etc. The tendency is that when there are several people in one family with the same first name, they will get different nicknames to distinguish them. A family with several Roberts might distinguish them by calling the oldest Robert and the others Bob, Rob, Robbie and Bert.The British usage of dividing names so that what was the familiar nickname from the first syllable is now replaced by the second syllable has now become common in the U.S. as well. Examples are William, once called Bill or Will, but now more often called Liam; Alexander, once usually Al or Alex, now often Xander; Sebastian, divided into Seb and Bastian; etc. Sometimes, these initials are given a word pronunciation instead of a letter pronunciation. For example, I knew someone whose given names were Benjamin Franklin, so he went by BF at first, but then people started pronouncing it as Biff. Such nicknames as Muffy (MF for Mary Frances) and Bimmy (BM for Brenda or Beth Marie) are also created from time to time.In recent years in the US, there has been a growing practice of boys who are named after their fathers as X Junior and having their nickname take the form of AJ (Adam Junior), CJ (Charles Junior), PJ (Paul Junior), etc. I think every serial show, especially the daytime ones, has at least one boy with that type of nickname.",

            "answer_text": "I think it's a uniquely American custom from certain parts of the US (which ones? not sure) to use initials as the name instead of saying the name. I remember overhearing a conversation in which a proud mama at work said of her new baby, \"His name's Charles John so we can call him CJ,\" and a French coworker of ours was astounded: \"You pick the name just so you can have the initials?\" I am American and I thought it was odd too, but I guess a lot of people do this.
