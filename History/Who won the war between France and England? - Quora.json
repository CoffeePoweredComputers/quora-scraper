            "answer_text": "Which one? There was the Hundred Years War, in which for the better part of it we were kicking the arses of les Frogs, and then some bloody peasant bird and her voices turned up and things weren\u2019t quite the same after that and we just kind of gave up on it all. Before and after that we had a few skirmishes with them (we nicked all their cash) and then we get to 1702 and the War of the Spanish Succession (we won). 1744 was the War of the Austrian Succession (they lost). There was the Seven Years War in 1756, Prussia won that one technically but we kicked French arse in India. There was a bit of an embarassment in the American Revoultionary War when the Treasonous Colonists enlisted French help, but since they were helping us to fight ourselves that one doesn\u2019t really count. Between 1793 and 1815 we were pounding the Pierres constantly (we won). After 1940 Vichy joined ze Germans! and we sank all their ships at Mers el Kebir. That annoyed them a bit. And that\u2019s the last time we scrapped with snailmunchers. In 1856 we were even on their side in the Crimea. Must have been hard for the men in red coats to remember they were supposed to be pointing their rifles away from the French. In 1914, we helped them stop ze Germans! and tried it again in 1940, except whoops. Well you can\u2019t win \u2019em all. Eh, Jacques? :P ",

            "answer_text": "Sadly no-one yet. It has oft been said that peace in Europe is no more than a ceasefire between wars, and regretfully, this is still true.  Between 8/10/2012 and 10/10/2012, approximately 40 French fishing vessels attacked an isolated group of nought but 5 British trawlers. Rocks were thrown, nets hooked on boats to damage propellers and engines, all in order to stop the Brits from fishing in French waters. Due to a combination of the above, 3 trawlers and 2 fishing boats were damaged and the French Navy had to intervene. The Great Scallop War began as French fishermen noted that British vessels were fishing in an area that they claim was within French territory, which the British denied.  Sadly, war erupted once more on 28/8/2018, when 35 French vessels sallied forth to chase away 3 scallop trawlers no doubt purposely sent by the old foe, perfidious Albion, the scandal! Rocks and nets were thrown, but the conflict had escalated, with metal bars and molotovs being thrown, damaging both British and French vessels respectively. Crisis talks were naturally held, lest western Europe plunge into nuclear fire, but broke down due to intransigence on both sides, with the French Navy vowing to intervene in all future disputes.  Alas, the drums of war beat again, as British fishermen report claims of deliberate sabotage upon their crab pots. Who knows what fresh horrors may be unleashed upon a fresh generation of brave nautical pioneers, but one thing remains very certain: War, war never changes ",
