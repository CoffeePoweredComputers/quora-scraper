            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think the Romans feared Hannibal any further after his death and when he died it was a relief to them. Yet he would remain a significant figure in the Roman psyche pretty much for the rest of the Republic and Empires existence. They couldn\u2019t help but admire him in some way and were known to build statues of him and also had an expression \u201cHannibal ante portal\u201d (Hannibal at the gates) to express fear or anxiety. He kind of moved from object of fear to legend and that legend lives on to this very day with Hannibal being considered one of history\u2019s great commanders. ",

After the Second Punic War ended in 202 BC, Hannibal served as chief magistrate of Carthage. Then, in 195 BC, he went into voluntary exile to avoid being turned over to the Romans. He became an adviser to the Seleucid king Antiochus and lost the battle of Eurymedon as commander of Antiochus\u2019 navy in 190. He fled to Crete and spent the next few years in various parts of Anatolia evading the Romans. Hannibal died sometime between 183 and 181 BC and left a letter saying, \u201clet my death finally relieve the Romans of the anxiety they have felt for so long because of me.\u201d ",
