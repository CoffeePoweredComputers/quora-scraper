            "answer_text": "I am keen to see the supposed assessment of the German observers in this question. I have never read such an assessment. But based on my understanding of expert assessment of Japanese military performance, the short answer is Yes, it was obsolete judging by the standards of modern warfare in WW2. Because this answer features personal opinions in addition to facts and expert assessments, take it with a grain of salt. (quite long but please bear with me)  Prelude During WW2, Japan was unique in that it was the only major Asian combatant nation that boasted a formidable war machine and significant technological-military-industrial capability. Some may argue that India and Chinese were also major combatant nations due to the large number of Indian + Chinese troops involved in the war but I disagree because it is my opinion that for a nation to qualify as major combatant nation, manpower alone isn\u2019t sufficient. That nation had to possess significant technological-military-industrial capability with a degree of self-sufficiency. Only 7 nations possessed that: the US, Nazi Germany, British Empire, the Soviet Union, France, Japan and Italy. The Japanese armed forces - its capabilities and philosophy - were not well known and well understood. Indeed, Japan was (and still is) a nation that was in every way different from European nations + the US. Japanese language, customs and traditions can be hard for non-Japanese to fully master and appreciate. Japan\u2019s peculiarity coupled with prevalent European\u2019s racial arrogance toward non-Europeans resulted in underestimation of the Japanese armed forces. With the exception of a few astute observers, most Westerners - both civilians + military personnel - viewed the Japanese with contempt. A stereotypical perception of a Japanese soldier was that of a monkey-like figure with buck-teeth, bespectacled, bow-legged, unkempt in ill-fitting uniforms. From this contempt stemmed the belief that Japanese fighting men were inferior and unworthy opponents to European or American fighting men. That was a belief widely held by British and American military personnel up to when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and executed their Oriental Blitzkrieg with astounding ferocity and efficiency that concluded in a sequence of resounding Japanese victories and humiliating Allied defeats. Not only did the Americans and British paid dearly for underestimating the Japanese, the bitter pills of defeat prompted a somber reevaluation of an enemy they had persistently considered inferior. The end result is eye-opening insight into the strength and weaknesses of the Japanese fighting force.  Army leadership mindset and its effect on doctrines and tactics Japanese infantry tactics in WW2 were influenced by the following factors: European influencesCombat experiencesMost importantly, the peculiar mindset of army leadersLong story short, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) that fought in WW2 was established in response to the need to eradicate rebels opposed to Emperor Meiji who sought to modernize the nation to deter foreign intrusion. In order to create a powerful military capable of defending the nation against foreign threats, the Japanese recruited European military experts. Convinced that their army and navy had to be modeled after the best army and navy in the world, the Japanese army was modeled after the Prussian (later German) army while the Japanese navy was modeled after the British Royal Navy. Consequently, Japanese army tactics/doctrines were heavily influenced by German infantry tactics/doctrines (at least initially). First and foremost, the IJA (and to a lesser extent the IJN) displayed an unfailing faith in the value of fighting spirit. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that one salient characteristic of the IJA that distinguished it from the armies of other major powers was its overemphasis on elan and fighting spirit over other factors, including weaponry, firepower and material. This had to do with the philosophies embraced by the founding leadership of the IJA all of whom were former samurais. The samurais stressed heavily the value of seishin (fighting spirit) and hand-to-hand combat in war. Although the army composed of commoners they commanded in the Boshin War defeated the samurai rebels, they praised the samurai rebels for their unmatched elan and skills in hand-to-hand combat. At the same time, they complained bitterly based on battlefield observations or anecdotal stories about the lack of martial spirit and aggressiveness of the commoner soldiers. As a result of their entrenched mindset, army leadership insisted on rigorous spiritual training to foster bravery and aggressiveness in the foot soldiers. Enlisted men were subjected to intense physical conditioning AND - most importantly - hand to hand combat. Now, this emphasis on hand-to-hand combat was at least understandable in an era when weapons did not yet possess the mass-destruction capability back in the late 19th and early 20th century (before the advent of automatic weapons like MG and SMG, tanks, artillery). However, what was incomprehensible was the fact that such emphasis on close-range combat and fighting spirit lasted throughout the time frame that spanned the years preceding and during WW2 in which weapons with mass-killing capabilities were introduced into service around the world; and the perpetuation of that combat style stemmed from support from the highest echelon in the IJA as well as combat experience in China. This warrants an elaboration. During the years between WW1 and WW2, there were intriguing developments among the leadership of the IJA that would affect everything associated with the service: its growth, structure, weapons, doctrines and tactics. Those developments revolved around the intense disputes over the restructuring of the IJA. Essentially, IJA leadership was divided into two camps: traditionalists and reformists. The reformists consisted of reform-minded officers who had been sent to Europe as attaches and observers of modern warfare between the Entente and Central Powers. Upon returning to Japan, they sought to modernize the IJA based on their evaluation of European-style modern warfare as well as their anticipation of what future conflicts would entail. Essentially, the reformists favored modern technologies, combined-arms warfare and triangular divisions. Having witnessed the effectiveness of triangular divisions supported by artillery in Europe, the reformists argued that smaller triangular divisions had greater mobility well-suited to mobile warfare (bewegungkrieg). Also, the reduction in manpower could either be used to form more divisions or artillery units attached to infantry divisions. The reformists also foresaw that future conflict would likely be protracted war against industrially powerful enemies (such as the US, Great Britain, and Soviet Union). Fighting such a war effectively demanded effective total mobilization of all kinds of resources: industrial, economic, technological and manpower. Finally, solid logistics could not be overlooked. Opposing the reformists were traditionalists who called for maintaining a large standing army. They argued that because Japan lagged significantly behind European nations and the US in terms of industrial capacity and material resources, it would not be able to fight a protracted war effectively. However, it could win a short war by attacking the enemy with overwhelming force and dealing a crushing defeat. This in turn demanded large manpower to sustain heavy casualties and to overwhelm the enemy by the application of superior seishin and hand-to-hand combat rather than technologies and firepower. The traditionalists\u2019 opposition to modern technologies stemmed from the following factors, of which some were valid and some were not: The IJA operated in Asia which, unlike modern industrialized Europe, was largely agrarian and without modern transportation infrastructure. The absence of paved roads, railroads and steel bridge would make movements by mechanized and motorized units extremely difficult. What was the point of using technologies if the conditions to facilitate their use did not exist in the IJA\u2019s theater of war? Later when the IJA won numerous tactical victories against the poorly armed, led and trained Chinese troops in China and against Allied troops in the Pacific with existing outdated weaponries, their disinterest in modern weapons intensified. They thought that there was no point in investing scarce resources to create modern weapons when what they already had were more than enough to defeat their enemies.Despite the great strides they made in industrialization, Japan\u2019s industrial capacity was surpassed by a wide margin by that of European powers and the US. The difficulty of mass production, poor quality control and lack of wherewithals for R&D made it exceedingly difficult to manufacture modern weaponries in quantities demanded by modern war.Army leaders were not only skeptical of but also disdainful of modern weaponries. Being former or descended from samurais, they preferred hand-to-hand combat, the swords or bayonets and regarded technologies as Western conceit. If anything, modern weapons took a backseat to the fighting spirit of individual soldiers. (not valid)Again, army leaders\u2019 undying belief in the power of seishin to overcome material and technological inferiority. (questionable)All in all, the traditionalists won the disputes although with some compromises. Arsenals were built to research and build new weapons. Light and medium tanks were developed to support IJA infantry in China. Some IJA divisions were transformed from square to triangular structure. But for the most part, the philosophies, and consequently doctrines and tactics of the IJA remained largely unchanged: an overemphasis on hand-to-hand combat AND superior seishin and aggressiveness.  Japanese infantry tactics The afore-described mindset of IJA leadership profoundly shaped Japanese infantry doctrines and tactics. In 1928, a new edition of \u201cPrinciples of Command\u201d was issued. Unsurprisingly, it stressed again and again that elan and morale were key to defeat or victory and therefore constituted the cornerstone of IJA\u2019s modern doctrine. In essence, Japanese infantry training emphasized: offensive-mindednessexploitation of the cover of darkness to achieve surprise, to encircle the enemy with stealthdeception and infiltrationswift shock action combined with sheer tenacity and aggressiveness to close in and engage the enemy in hand to hand combat embodied in the bayonetThe rationale underlying those tactical elements was: to compensate for deficiencies in modern weaponries and materials. Also, by fighting the enemy in close quarter, the Japanese hoped to nullify their enemy\u2019s advantage in artillery, automatic weapons.the Japanese\u2019s unshakable conviction in the power of seishin to overcome anything: including bombs and bullets (once again)Accordingly, Japanese infantry recruits trained ceaselessly in bayonet drills and various forms of close-quarter fighting such as kendo, judo, wrestling.  Bayonet training  Kendo match Throughout the war, Japanese soldiers stood out with their bayonet-affixed rifles in encounters with their enemies. It became an iconic image of IJA infantrymen.   Therein lay the strength of Japanese army training program. It produced a large number of fighting men who were physically resilient, agile and deadly in bayonet combats. Zhukov commented on the IJA troops who fought the Soviets in the Mongolian border class in 1939: Well-trained especially in close-quarter fighting that involved the bayonets. Well-disciplined, tenacious in combat, stubborn in defense. Junior commanders were well-trained and fanatically determined in battle. However There were serious weaknesses which the Japanese failed to rectified throughout the war. Little attention was given to combined-arms attacks that involved a well-balanced force composed of AFV, artillery, air support and infantry. This was easy to understand because Japanese leaders had little understanding of and disdain for technologies (mentioned above); and even if they had wanted to conduct combined-arms attack, Japan\u2019s limited resources meant that they could not procure enough hardware to accomplish that. Moreover, there was a notable lack of individual initiative, imagination AND cooperation between large-scale friendly formations. This stemmed from several factors: Japanese culture encouraged competitive spirit. Competition was preferred to cooperation. Within the IJA, team combat tactics were discouraged. There was also regionalism. The leadership believed that by organizing conscripts from the same geographical regions into regional units and inciting them to outcompete units from other regions, they would be motivated to fight hard for the honor of their regions. This meant that IJA units were highly motivated individually but lacked the willingness and the ability to operate together in large-scale operation over vast geographical area (due to inferior-quality radios which hampered field communication)Widespread brutality in the army (and navy):Since its establishment, the officer corp of the IJA was composed of samurais which occupied the highest social class whereas the foot soldiers came from lower classes. This resulted in officers treating their men with contempt and brutality.To counteract the spread of individualism and baleful western influences (during the Taisho democracy era), Japanese officers resorted to corporal punishments to instill discipline and to purge harmful liberal ideas from the men.Believing that swift victories in combat could be achieved by swift execution of order, army officers endeavored to turn their subordinate into automatons who would carry out orders without questions and thinking. This in turn necessitated instilling fear by sadistic beating, hazing and abuse of the recruits.The unconscionable violence pervading the army produced fearsome killing agents who would fight the war with astounding barbarism and efficiency, leading to atrocities. But at the same time, unquestioning obedience stifled individual initiative and creativity in military situation. Indeed, IJA\u2019s infantry training exercises were marked by little imagination, almost invariably staged with predictable outcomes unsupported infantry units routinely penetrated the first line of Soviet defenses. Despite the many deficiencies exposed during maneuvers, esp the lack of combined-arms cooperation, they always ended with an infantry breakthrough. In other words, exercises relied more on memorization of predictable tactical solutions than on imagination. One consequence was the unimaginative application of tactics even in unfamiliar situations wherein conditions for success did not pertain. Prevalent among IJA\u2019s officer corps was an uncritical adherence to textbook prescription. This was akin to a student who was very studious but not particularly clever who frequently consults his/her notes for clues to solve an unfamiliar problem. Zhukov pointedly captured this weakness: their officers, esp senior officers, lack initiative and are apt to act according to crammed rulebook. At this point, you can clearly see how outdated Japanese infantry tactics were: characterized by little individual initiative, unimaginative application of tactical solutions, and an obsessive stress on seishin and hand-to-hand combat. Next, let\u2019s see how effective such tactics were in the war.  Effectiveness of IJA\u2019s infantry tactics In the wake of humiliating defeats at the hands of an enemy they had regarded as inferior, Allied soldiers were astounded by the audacity, rapidity, tenacity and sheer barbarism of their Japanese foes. Almost overnight, stereotypes of the Japanese were overturned from inferiority to superiority. Allied soldiers ascribed almost superhuman qualities to Japanese fighters. Some let their first impression prevailed over their rationality by asserting that the Japanese were even better than the Germans (ridiculous). However, a rational assessment reveals the true strengths and weaknesses of the IJA and its soldiers and officers. There were several factors accounting for the incredible success of the IJA\u2019s conquest of European colonial possessions. Battle experience: the IJA had fought the Chinese for years before 1941 so they obviously had accumulated a great deal of experience. While the poorly trained and armed Chinese soldiers were not comparable to Allied soldiers who were more physically fit and better armed, the experience fighting the Chinese hardened IJA infantrymen and accustomed them to the stress and perils of combat.Morale fueled by inflated sense of racial superiority: racial arrogance and contempt pertained in Japan too. The Japanese emulated their Nazi ally in formulating and promoting their own brand of racial superiority. Japanese troops were inculcated with the myth of Japanese spiritual superiority, racial purity that would enable them to defeat the materially superior but hedonistic and cowardly European troops (Chinese soldiers were regarded as armed bandits. British, French and Dutch soldiers were deemed as fit for fighting rebels in their colonies only. But the Japanese respected the Germans).The incompetence of Allied commanders and soldiery: German victory in Europe compelled the British to concentrate most of their resources to counter German threat in Europe at the expense of defense in Asian colonies. Inadequate funding, supply and refusal to reinforce Singapore and Malaya led to deterioration of defense there. Allied troops were poorly trained and unmotivated. Their commanders were incompetent and underestimating the Japanese.All of these factors contributed to easy Japanese victories. It stands to reason that their success was due as much to the shortcomings of their adversaries as to their own strengths. However, as the Allies recovered from their setbacks, reorganized and fought back with vigor and determination, they would come to appreciate both the strengths and weaknesses of the IJA. On the one hand, Allied soldiers and officers recognized the daring and ruthlessness with which the Japanese conducted flanking maneuvers and night-fighting that relied heavily on speed, stealth and surprise. According to one US Army handbook: Surprise is a cardinal principle of all Japanese actions. It is accomplished through rapidity of advance, deception of all kinds, and infiltration and demonstration in the enemy rear; in short, all means available are utilized, and speed is greatly emphasized. The Japanese proficiency in bayonet combat was acknowledged, esp in the jungles on Pacific islands which greatly reduced combat range and allowed the Japanese to engage in close-quarter action. And finally, the Allies respected the Japanese for their sheer tenacity and bravery both in offense and defense. The Japanese proved very adept in the defense as demonstrated on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Also, they consistently stayed where they were and fought to the death. But on the other hands Allied soldiers quickly recognized the serious shortcomings explained above: lack of imagination, inability to conduct combined-arms operation, lack of cooperation in ground operation, inflexibility and above recklessness (engendered by a mixture of arrogance and overemphasis on attacking). Japanese troops unfailingly showed a fondness for reckless attack even when they lacked the resources to ensure success, when they were outgunned and outnumbered. Their disregard for heavy casualties made it easy for them to do so. US Marines were amazed at both the fanatical bravery and stupidity of Japanese troops they fought on Pacific Islands. Their fanaticism (fueled by contempt of the enemies) caused them to fight in tactically asinine manner which ended in self-annihilation. The IJA\u2019s unimaginative tactics, tactical inflexibility, lack of initiative and cooperation on the grounds brought disastrous consequences in battles against well-prepared enemies. One example was the Battle of Imphal between the IJA and British-Indian force commanded by British General William Slim. In 1942, Slim\u2019s forces suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Japanese in Burma because the Japanese employed swift flanking maneuver to encircle and cut off retreat route of the British. To achieve this, IJA small units carried minimal amount of supplies to move unencumbered on the field. They were able to defeat the British by swift surprise overpowering attack and capture British supplies for their own use. Recognizing that Japanese tactical success depended on surprise and speed of attack at the expense of logistics, Slim knew that if his soldiers could defeat Japanese flanking maneuvers and protect the supply, Japanese attack would falter and fail eventually. This was exactly what British-Indian forces did in the battle of Imphal in 1944. The Japanese applied the same tactical tricks they used 2 years before against an enemy well-prepared to counter that tactic. In the end, Japanese flanking maneuvers and ill-supplied IJA units ran out of supplies and fell into disarray. Having been taught to obey orders without questions, Japanese soldiers were never allowed to think outside of the box and to take over when they lost their commanders. This was in stark contrast to the German army in which soldiers were encouraged to act above their ranks and to take over when officers became casualties which gave the German army high degree of organizational cohesion. Indeed, US General J. Lawton Collins who had the distinction of serving both in Europe and the Pacific made the following insightful statement (Who was the tougher World War II enemy, the Germans or the Japanese?) They were radically different. The German was far more skilled than the Japanese. Most of the Japanese that we fought were not skilled men. Not skilled leaders. The German had a professional army. . . . The Japanese army was very much like ours in a sense. They had a small corps of officers who were professionals. But the bulk of their people were not professionals in the sense of knowing their business and so on. They didn\u2019t have the equipment that we had. They didn\u2019t know how to handle combined arms-the artillery and the support of the infantry-to the same extent we did. \u2026 They fought very, very hard, but they were not nearly as skillful as the Germans. The lack of cooperation between field units was evident on Pacific islands. Ill-informed on the progresses of friendly units and disdainful of each other, IJA units mounted uncoordinated piecemeal attacks against US positions defended by barb wires and machine guns. The result was invariably the decimation of IJA units.  Conclusion When judged against the framework of modern warfare of WW2 characterized by the widespread use of advanced technologies, communication and combined-arms operations, Japanese infantry tactics were indeed outdated. The outdatedness of those tactics could be attributed to the outdated mindset of IJA leadership. Locked in an old worldview of the romantic samurai tradition, IJA leaders obsessively emphasized seishin and hand-to-hand combat while neglecting the important role of modern technologies and communication. For the Japanese, modern weaponries were secondary to the intangible elements of warfare: surprise, deception, speedy maneuvers, faith in victory, and fighting spirit. The outcome was a fighting force made of soldiers who were exceptionally brave, physically resilient, agile, proficient in close-quarter combat, tenacious and at the same time well-drilled automatons who excelled in familiar combat situations but floundered in unfamiliar situations and were inflexible in the execution of their battle plans. Japanese tactics worked well against ill-prepared enemies and at close range. But against well-prepared enemies with modern weaponries and supported by airpower and artillery, they failed utterly. When given an order, Japanese commanders sought to achieve the objectives with the available resources rather than determine the chance of achieving success. The rigidity and lack of imagination of IJA leadership coupled with Allies superiority in technologies and weaponries led to repeated defeats for the IJA after the 1st few months of easy victories in 1942. Those aforementioned attributes made the IJA a truly unique fighting force. I think there is a factual basis in the cliche that the Japanese were first rate soldiers in a third rate army. The individual Japanese soldiers were tough, determined, brave and fanatical. But their leadership and everything stemming from it: tactics, doctrines, organization were ineffective and on many occasions proved spectacularly incompetent. A legitimate argument can be made that the IJA had the mindset of a 17th-century army equipped with 20th-century weapons. Their irrational and unfailing belief in the power of fighting spirit, intangible assets cheaper than materials such as sheer physical and spiritual strengths, and neglect of essential role of technologies showed that the Japanese were incapable of fighting modern war effectively and they paid the price dearly for that inability. General William Slim: Strength of IJA lay, according to Marshal Slim, not in high-level leadership and operational competence but in the spiritual strength of individual Japanese soldiers. It was the combination of obedience and ferocity that made the Japanese army whatever its conditions, so formidable, and would make any army formidable. It would make an European army invincible. The Japanese were ruthless and bold as ants while their designs went well, but if their plans were disturbed or thrown out\u2014ant-like again\u2014they fell into confusion, were slow to re-adjust themselves, and invariably clung too long to their original schemes. This, to commanders with their unquenchable military optimism, which rarely allowed in their narrow administrative margins for any setback or delay, was particularly dangerous. The fundamental fault of their generalship was a lack of moral, as distinct from physical, courage. They were not prepared to admit that they had made a mistake, that their plans had misfired and needed recasting. ... Rather than confess that, they passed on to their subordinates, unchanged, the order that they themselves had received, well knowing that with the resources available the tasks demanded were impossible. Time and again, this blind passing of responsibility ran down a chain of disaster... . They scored highly by determination; they paid heavily for lack of flexibility. Douglas MacArthur: Japanese troops fight with the greatest tenacity. The military quality of the rank and file remains of the highest caliber. The officer corps however, deteriorates as you go up the scale. It is fundamentally based upon a caste and feudal system and does not represent strict professional merit. Therein lies Japan\u2019s weakness. Her sons are strong of limbs and stout of heart but weak in leadership. Gripped inexorably by a military hierarchy, that hierarchy is now failing the nation. It has had neither the imagination nor the foresighted ability to organize Japanese resources for a total war. Arthur Swinson: The Japanese martial system produces not only courage, loyalty and brutality but also rigidity and stupidity. It led to great daring and acceptance of risks but also to bad staff work and administrative blunders.  Reference(s) 1/ Japan's Imperial Army: Its Rise and Fall (Modern War Studies) - Edward J.

            "answer_text": "If you study the Russo-Japanese war 1904-1905 you will see tha the tactics used then were little different than those used in WWI by the West ten years later. The German observers were probably right. The Japanese were too wedded to the notion of bushido the warrior spirit overcoming material firepower in battle.Their idea was that the warrior with the highest spirit would overcome another with more firepower but inferior warrior spirit. Going into WWII the Japanese along with the Germans, thought Americans were decadent and soft, lacking in the warrior ethos needed to win any kind of war.The Germans obviously forgot WWI. The Japanese were caught up in their own kind of racism. No doubt racism figured into the German's assessment too. Most of Europe thought that the development of first class fighters or soldiers was beyond the reach of a bunch of near sighted buck-toothed yellow monkeys. They learned differently. In the beginning of the war, the infamous Banzai Charge was thought to be the way to prevail over the enemy, and I might point out that it was not much different than the bayonet charges so beloved by the British and French and used with equally dismal and criminal results at the Somme and at Verdun and other murderous battles on the Western Front only 20 years earlier. So the Germans, who were first to shed those suicidal bayonet attacks, might have felt a bit of racial superiority. Later in the war the lessons of the first years sunk in and only commanders who knew there was no hope of victory, ordered one last charge, like the one carried out on Saipan. In other situations like Iwo Jima, all attempts to engage the Americans at the water's edge were abandoned in lieu of a battle of attrition. No charges, only grinding attritional warfare. On Iwo Jima total Japanese KIA were less than the total Marine casualties, but a record 6,800 plus Marines died, and another 20,000 were wounded. That comes out to two divisions worth of casualties out of three divisions involved. So to put it another way, of the 30,000 man invasion force against 20,000 Japanese, nearly the entire invasion force ended up as casualties: 26,000. So a whole lot of replacements were pumped into the fight during the battle. Okinawa was a bit better. There too, they chose to not fight on the terms of the US, but go underground. The executive officer of the 62nd Army a real firebrand who insisted on taking the offensive so the commanding general Ushijima relented over the objections of his operations officer Col. Yahara. A nighttime offensive was staged including two nighttime counter landings on the coast and an overland attack involving tanks and numerous infantry battalions of first line troops. The results were predictable. The Americans crushed the attack with firepower and artillery. Those same troops had they pursued the defensive battle as planned might have made the American casualties even greater. As it was 12,000 US soldiers and Marines were killed and another 42,000 wounded out of three Marine and four Army divisions employed. So the Japanese brought defensive warfare against large odds to a fine art. I updated my answer by adding two photos that refer to an answer to one of the comments. Both these 150mm guns, the Model 89 Gun and Model 96 Howitzer were used on Okinawa and were for years on display on Ft. Buckner. Upon returning Okinawa to Japanese domination (It was once an independent country before being invaded and annexed by Japan in the late 1800\u2019s) the guns were shipped back to Japan for display in their museum rewrite of the war. The top picture shows dark splotches on the gun where it is covered from tip to tail with heavy machine gun bullet divots. The gun was strafed by American aircraft at some point. I suspect this is the same gun I used to climb on in the outside display area at the museum at Ft. Buckner.   ",
