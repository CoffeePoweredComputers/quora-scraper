            "answer_text": " It has been whispered for years that Russian President Vladimir Putin holds incriminating materials over the head of United States President Donald Trump. It has never been confirmed if this is true or not but the whispers are growing louder. Jon Cooper, Chairman of the Democratic Coalition, was bold enough to tweet out the following this week. \"I can't confirm this directly, but a knowledgeable friend of mine just told me a Russian oligarch and Putin own Trump,\" Cooper wrote. \"He owes them millions and has not paid. Trump is fearful of the pee tapes being released, does not want to lose Melania, and is afraid of being assassinated.\" Things are obviously heating up in the New Year when it comes to the Mueller investigation and U.S. - Russia relations in general. NBC News ran an op-ed this past week that speculated that former Marine Paul Whelan was simply a \"pawn in a Russian spy swap attempt between Putin and Trump.\"\"Count me among those who think Putin may be seeking to swap [Whelan] for Maria Butina, who has already pleaded guilty to infiltrating America's conservative political movement as a Russian agent,\" Ned Price wrote. \"The Russians may calculate that Whelan, a military veteran who has said positive things about President Donald Trump on Russian social media, constitutes the perfect quo for their quid - both in their eyes and in Trump's \u2026 That's why we may see the Whelan case resolved in fairly short order with a swap for Butina. But what we know today suggests that such an outcome would equate a confessed Russian agent who has been afforded due process with an apparent American businessman detained and imprisoned without evidence (that we know of).

            "answer_text": "Any Russian leader runs a higher risk of being assassinated, compared to his Western colleagues. Why? Russia's recent political tradition is much more brutal than the Western one, with many rulers murdered and toppled by their internal rivals and revolutionaries.The prize for the lucky contender for taking power in Russia far exceeds what such a project may bring in other countries. The winner gets the largest country on earth, a decent army with lots of nuclear weapons, the best secret police in the world, and vast quantities of oil, gas and other minerals he can sell abroad with great profit.Russian society is far more lenient about power transfers on the top that involve killing the previous ruler.Putin himself comes from secret services and is aware of a multitude of ways of killing him that you and I can't even imagine.Putin is a ruthless ruler. He knows he has made a lot of enemies. He knows as well that the most dangerous of his enemies are those not known to him.One of the reasons Putin is always ridiculously late for his appointments is messing up any possible assassination plan. Here's a photo to prove that Putin never takes lightly his own security:  ",
