            "answer_text": "They aren\u2019t. It is the power of the round, the range of engagement and the mind of the one wielding the gun that matter. I\u2019ve often said of all the firearms at my disposal, my 75 year old Lee Enfield No.4 Mk.1 is by far the deadliest weapon I possess. It makes any AR-15 I might have be a toy by comparison. The Enfield in terms of destructive power and used in anger would cause far more carnage than any semi-auto I possess. The fact it is bolt action is irrelevant. That glass smooth action makes it able to fire 30\u201340 aimed shots per minute, comparable to any AR-15, it uses detachable magazines and fires a potent full power .30 caliber round that in close quarters would be just this side of a 12 gauge shotgun in terms of harm it could inflict. Yet every single gun control group claims they aren\u2019t after your bolt action hunting guns. Very few of them, I suspect, have hunted or seen what a .30 caliber round capable of reaching out 700\u2013800 yards does in terms of damage to a living being. If they did and spent more than 5 seconds thinking about it they\u2019d be focusing on milsurps and larger calibers, not AR-15s. Second most deadly is aimed fire in general. Pulling a Charles Whitman, such as Las Vegas, is far more deadly than some close in loser wannabe targeting innocents in a short term suicidal act. Everyone focuses on the bump stock used in Las Vegas rather than the perch the shooter fired from. It was the volume of fire that attracted attention. Spray and pray. Had the Las Vegas shooter pulled a Whitman and used a lowly scoped hunting rifle with aimed intent, he could have killed hundreds. Simply because of the distance and no one expecting fire from a hotel, at night, in a crowded venue with lots of noise to cover where the rounds were coming from. Some are probably blanching at this point at the cold, heartless analysis of mass shootings but it is the truth. None of this is a secret. With a cold heart, lack of empathy, any firearm is dangerous. Semi-autos are no more dangerous than any other gun if the gun being used is being used for evil instead of good. But gun control has played identity politics with guns and have decided that the AR-15 and semi-automatics in general are the bad privileged guns that are the oppressors and bringers of violence. They are so wrapped into their narrative they can\u2019t see that guns are not safe inherently. As one Russian video blogger stated: \u201cIs gun. Is not safe.\u201d. There is no such thing as less or more dangerous with a projectile moving at 1\u20133 times the speed of sound. All we\u2019re arguing is relative degrees of how much safety you\u2019re lacking, not the fact you\u2019re about to suffer harm. Semi-autos are the most common action type sold in the USA today and have been since the 1980s when modern semi-auto pistols began to displace classic revolvers. By the 1990s the same trend was underway for long guns. Thanks in most part to gun control for calling attention to them. Popularity breeds commonality which in turns breeds common presence. No one should be shocked that semi-autos are common today. But that does not make them the most dangerous. Your premise is false. As my Enfield or M1 Garand or Tikka T3x could attest to. ",

            "answer_text": "They aren\u2019t. Semiautomatics generally (not always) have less powerful cartridges than bolt-action hunting rifles. A hunting rifle is dangerous beyond a kilometer; Most semiautomatic pistols aren\u2019t really dangerous beyond a hundred meters, and most semiautomatic rifles (being in an intermediate round) aren\u2019t that dangerous beyond 400m. In fact, it\u2019s actually illegal to hunt with a 5.56mm (the round AR-15\u2019s use), for example, on large game because that round simply isn\u2019t powerful enough. Not only that, but bolt-actions, lever-actions and pump-actions are more commonly available and aren\u2019t subject to any regulations, and you can buy one from a pawnshop easily. Revolvers can be double-action (ergo, effectively semiauto) and can be chambered for cartridges that can kill literally anything in North America, like .500 Magnum, AKA a grizzly-killer cartridge similar to elephant guns. If it can kill a grizzly in one shot, it\u2019ll more than readily kill a man. Shotgun slugs, within 100m, will likewise do a LOT more damage than any 5.56 from sheer mass alone. The question you have asked seems to be based on a faulty assumption that having shorter times (sometimes) between rounds fired directly correlates with danger to what/whoever\u2019s downrange. That isn\u2019t the case necessarily. For \u201cdangerous to the shooter\u201d, though, I have to point out that muskets CAN explode on you if used improperly. So again, semiautomatics aren\u2019t inherently more dangerous. ",
