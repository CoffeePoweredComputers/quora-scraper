            "answer_text": "Justice depends upon your point of view, as does injustice. The father of young girl who was raped and killed see\u2019s her killer get a sentence of only 25 years because he \u2018cut a deal\u2019. To HIM that\u2019s injustice, but to the prosecution and the criminal, it might seem like justice. There will never be a time when there\u2019s no \u2018injustice\u2019 because each person sees things from their own view. Some will call things \u201cdeeply ingrained injustice\u201d, but just what does that mean? Does it mean having minimum sentences? Some think the \u20183 strikes\u2019 laws some states have are \u2018unjust\u2019, others think our laws should be stronger. Some say people are treated differently based on who they are, their color, their age, their income. Yep, that\u2019s possible, but how many years do YOU think that father would have been happy with? How many would YOU have given him? Or are you now wanting to know things like \u201cWas he black or white, poor or rich, educated or not\u201d\u2026 I can tell you this\u2026 Dad could care less! ",

            "answer_text": "Justice is an ugly thing IMO. It is not sweet, beautiful, kind and loving. It is the \u201cfinal judgement\u201d\u2026.a dark consequence for not submitting. So for me, the nobility, beauty and attractiveness of goodness* is infinitely better than any form of \u201cjustice coming down like a hammer on me, you or them\u201d. This is why making goodness the highest passion in our personal life and displaying it to others is the answer, not \u201cjustice\u201d.  I hope this helps.  *: the mix of these three.. Transcendent love: a free gift of hoping for the virtuous betterment of ourselves and others. It is unconditional with no expectations in return and frees us and others of our fears so we can gain confidence, understanding and skill without being angry or defensive. Virtue: truthful, wise, logical, prudent, trustworthy, praiseworthy, just, self-restraint, lacking corruption, forgiving, organized, clean, caring, principled, wisely generous, intelligent, humble, courageous. Wisdom: allows us to avoid traps and guides us to success using accumulated insights into what works and what doesn\u2019t work in life and relationships. ",
