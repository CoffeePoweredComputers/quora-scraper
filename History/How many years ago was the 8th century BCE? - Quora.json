            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll let you figure it out. How many centuries are we away from the start of CE? Then add the number of centuries BCE. Since they count backward starting from where CE starts, that gives a good approximation. Since we are only 20 years in, you could just say 20 centuries and 20 years (hence this year being 2020) and the same sort of adjustment could be made on the other end if it wasn\u2019t the century mark. Basically add the two dates together. Now maybe we won\u2019t have someone asking how many years ago was 1653 BCE? Just add the two dates together unless you are only working on one side or the other of that starting point, then subtract the two dates. Like the age of the US: 2020 -1776 =244 ",
