Chandrgupta mauraya Chandrgupta was a ansient king . His dynasty name as moraya . The capital name as patliputra . As per the conseltence of chanakya he eat possion in his food . One day his pragnent wife Dhurdhara shared the food. Then chanakya cut the head of his wife to save the child .  Dhurdhara  Chanakya The child have bindu of possion on his head and named as Bindusar.  Bindusar Then at the age of 40 year Chandragupta married with greek princes daughter of Seleukos Nikator devi Helena . They have son name as Justin .

And born beautiful son Sushima .  Sushima When Bindusar was injured then Shubhadrangi the daughter of brahmin saved him . She was from the Champa city. When she born an astrologer predicted that she will have one son as king and another as religion man . When she grew up her father took her to Bindusar palace in patliputra. Bindusar wives jealous of her beauty trained as royal Barbara .  Shubhadrangi Bindusar have 16 wives and 101 sons . But three sons name were mentioned Sushima, Ashoka and vitashoka . Shubhadrangi have two sons Ashoka and vitashoka. The difference between Ashoka and Sushima about one year while vitashoka was youngest son of Bindusar. Ashoka's mother give name to Ashoka which means without sorrow . The possion of Bindusar goes in Ashoka and he became ugly in looks. That is why Bindusar didn't like Ashoka.  Ashoka Now as per like as all hero story they begin with intelligence from the child life. When Ashoka was a child he kill the tiger from a Wooden stick. Radhagupta was trained Ashoka . One day Bindusar wants to know who will be the next king so they visit to the palace but Ashoka didn't go there as Bindusar hates him . Then Radhagupta gave him elephant as a gift to reach the place. Bindusar asked from their teacher who will be the next king among all prince. But although teacher know Ashoka will be the king but before this Ashoka' s mother told him that not to take the name of Ashoka . So that's why the teacher gave him hint that \u201c who sit in good place eat good food and touches the height\u201d . Ashoka deeply think and say he will be the next king. As he is sitting down on the floor and eat rice With cud and he is sitting on elephant. After this Bindusar never asked who will be the king. Now when Ashoka was of 18 years old he goes to the ujjain to handle the revolt . In ujjain he meat merchant daughter Devi and proposed for marriage her father agree but Devi said she will married if he will handle the matter without blood shead . That time Devi was of 16 years.

When Ashoka waked up and said he will manage without blood shead.  Maharani Devi Then Ashoka beome a governor of ujjain . On the other hand Sushima become governor of Taxshishila . When Bindusar was king . When Ashoka's wife was pregnant then Sushima request Bindusar to put out the Ashoka from magadh . Then Ashoka exile to kaling . Then Sushima try to kill Devi but Ashoka's mother come in between and killed. This leads to huge agressivness in Ashoka and wants to take revenge from him . Now Ashoka was totally alone in kaliang then he meat kaurwaki . Kaurwaki was fisherman daughter.  Kaurwaki Then there was a revolt in Taxshishila because of wrong administration. Then Ashoka handle the revolt . There was a person named as devtha said one day he will be the king of whole continent . On the other hand one minister subhandhu told Bindusar that chanakya is the reason of death of his mother . Bindusar have dought on chanakya for respect chanakya leave from his ministry but although he brings subhandhu to ministry . When Bindusar asked the nurse then he feels guilty and want chanakya back but chanakya disagree and took fast . He gives gift to minister where it has Poisson air . Minister as well as chanakya dead and he takes revenge from him as well. Then again there was a revolt in Taxshishila and again Ashoka control it that time minister khalayatak also favoured Ashoka because Sushima through the glavous of khalayatak in his fun that's why he favoured Ashoka . When Bindusar was near his death and lying on bed Ashoka run towards patliputra that time they wants to know who will be the next king . Bindusar's choice was Sushima but he was in Taxshishila. Minister want Ashoka to be king so they told Bindusar that they will make king to Ashoka and Sushima for Taxshishila . But Bindusar not agree so they called devta to put crown who should be king so he put crown on the head of Ashoka . When Sushima come back and said he is the deserving king . Then Ashoka attack on kingdom and kill his brothers. He put the pit on coal and kill Sushima. He became king .  After taking revenge he became cruel . He make a hell named as Ashoka's hell . And put the jailer garrika for it . Garrika was too much cruel that when Ashoka asked him for jailer his parents didn't give permission so he killed his parents. Then Ashoka was in his kingdom and saw some Buddhist monks and called them in their palace . He asked about themselves . The monk say he is Buddhist monk and son of Sushima Nigrodha . Nigrodha neither show agressivness and his face looks calm . Ashoka stand up from his place and huge him . Then Ashoka says him he can sit on any place only Ashoka's place was empty so he sit there and Ashoka also sit with him and they talk about Buddhism . This is first time Ashoka hear about Buddhism. Ashoka married Padmavati but she dead in three years after her marriage. Ashoka want the kaliang so he proposed war .    Kaliang have powerful Navy and people were cultured so they rejected the proposal but Ashoka navy was too much cruel and war against in kaliang. That time raja Anantha was king . The war goes on more than four years.   It is also said that one day when Ashoka walk in city of kaliang the destruction he saw there and his heart converted from there.

            "answer_text": "Ashoka Title: Devanam Priyadarshi Birth: 304 B.C. Birthplace: Pataliputra (modern day Patna) Dynasty: Maurya Parents: Bindusara and Devi Dharma Reign: 268 \u2013232 B.C. Symbol: Lion Religion: Buddhism Spouse: Asandhimitra, Devi, Karuvaki, Padmavati, Tishyaraksha Children: Mahendra, Sanghamitra, Tivala, Kunala, Charumati Ashoka was the third ruler of the illustrious Maurya dynasty and was one of the most powerful kings of the Indian subcontinent in ancient times. His reign between 273 BC and 232 B.C. was one of the most prosperous periods in the history of India. Ashoka\u2019s empire consisted most of India, South Asia and beyond, stretching from present day Afghanistan and parts of Persia in the west, to Bengal and Assam in the east, and Mysore in the south. Buddhist literature document Ashoka as a cruel and ruthless monarch who underwent a change of heart after experiencing a particularly gruesome war, the Battle of Kalinga. After the war, he embraced Buddhism and dedicated his life towards dissemination of the tenets of the religion. He became a benevolent king, driving his administration to make a just and bountiful environment for his subjects. Owing to his benevolent nature as a ruler, he was given the title \u2018Devanampriya Priyadarshi\u2019. Ashoka and his glorious rule is associated with one of the most prosperous time in the history of India and as a tribute to his non-partisan philosophies, the Dharma Chakra adorning the Ashok stambh has been made a part of the Indian National Flag. The emblem of the Republic of India has been adapted from the Lion Capital of Ashoka. Early Life Ashoka was born to Mauryan King Bindusara and his queen Devi Dharma in 304 B.C. He was the grandson of the great Chandragupta Maurya, the founder emperor of the Maurya Dynasty. Dharma (alternatively known as Subhadrangi or Janapadkalyani) was the daughter of a Brahmin priest from the kindom of Champa, and was assigned relatively low position in the royal household owing to politics therein. By virtue of his mother\u2019s position, Ashoka also received a low position among the princes. He had only one younger sibling, Vithashoka, but, several elder half-brothers. Right from his childhood days Ashoka showed great promise in the field of weaponry skills as well as academics. Ashoka\u2019s father Bindusara, impressed with his skill and knowledge, appointed him as the Governer of Avanti. Here he met and married Devi, the daughter of a tradesman from Vidisha. Ashoka and Devi had two children, son Mahendra and daughter Sanghamitra. Asoka quickly grew into an excellent warrior general and an astute statesman. His command on the Mauryan army started growing day by day. Ashoka\u2019s elder brothers became jealous of him and they assumed him being favoured by King Bindusara as his successor to the throne. King Bindusara\u2019s eldest son Sushima convinced his father to send Ashoka far away from the capital city of Pataliputra to Takshashila province. The excuse given was to subdue a revolt by the citizens of Takshashila. However, the moment Ashoka reached the province, the militias welcomed him with open arms and the uprising came to an end without any fight. This particular success of Asoka made his elder brothers, especially Susima, more insecure. Accession to the Throne Susima started inciting Bindusara against Ashoka, who was then sent into exile by the emperor. Ashoka went to Kalinga, where he met a fisherwoman named Kaurwaki. He fell in love with her and later, made Kaurwaki his second or third wife. Soon, the province of Ujjain started witnessing a violent uprising. Emperor Bindusara called back Ashoka from exile and sent him to Ujjain. The prince was injured in the ensuing battle and was treated by Buddhist monks and nuns. It was in Ujjain that Asoka first came to know about the life and teachings of Buddha. In the following year, Bindusura became seriously ill and was literally on his deathbed. Sushima was nominated successor by the king but his autocratic nature made him unfavourable among the ministers. A group of ministers, led by Radhagupta, called upon Ashoka to assume the crown. Following Bindusara\u2019s death in 272 B.C., Ashoka attacked Pataliputra, defeated and killed all his brothers, including Sushima. Among all his brothers he only spared his younger brother Vithashoka. His coronation took place four years after his ascent to throne. Buddhist literatures describe Ashoka as a cruel, ruthless and bad-tempered ruler. He was named \u2018Chanda\u2019 Ashoka meaning Ashoka the Terrible, due to his disposition at that time. He was attributed with building Ashoka\u2019s Hell, a torture chamber manned by an executioner to punish offenders. After he became the empperor, Ashoka launched brutal assaults to expand his empire, which lasted for around eight years. Although the Maurya Empire that he inherited was quite sizable, he expanded the borders exponentially. His kingdom stretched from Iran-Afghanistan borders in the West to Burma in the east. He annexed the whole of Southern India except Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka). The only kingdom outside his grasp was Kalinga which is the modern day Orissa. The Battle of Kalinga and Submission to Buddhism Ashoka launched an assault to conquer Kalinga during 265 B.C. and the battle of Kalinga became a turning point in his life. Ashoka personally led the conquest and secured victory. On his orders, the whole of province was plundered, cities were destroyed and thousands of people were killed. The morning after the victory he went out to survey the states of things and encountered nothing except burnt houses and scattered corpses. Having brought face to face with the consequences of war, for the first time he felt overwhelmed with the brutality of his actions. He saw flashes of the destruction that his conquest had wrought even after returning to Pataliputra. He experienced an utter crisis of faith during this period and sought penance for his past deeds. He vowed never to practice violence again and devoted himself completely to Buddhism. He followed the directives of Brahmin Buddhist gurus Radhaswami and Manjushri and started propagating Buddhist principles throughout his kingdom. Thus Chandashoka morphed into Dharmashoka or the pious Ashoka. Administration of Ashoka The administration of Ashoka after his spiritual transformation was focused solely on the well-being of his subjects. The emperor was at the helm of the administration following the established model put forward by Mauryan Kings before Ashoka. He was closely assisted in his administrative duties by his younger brother, Vithashoka and a group of trusted ministers, whom Ashoka consulted before adopting any new administrative policy. The most important members of this advisory council included the Yuvaraj (Crown Prince), the Mahamantri (Prime Minister), the Senapati (general), and the Purohita (priest). Asoka\u2019s reign saw introduction of a large number of benevolent policies as compared to his predecessors. He adopted a paternalistic view on administration and proclaimed \"All men are my Children\", as evident from the Kalinga edict. He also expressed his indebtedness to his subjects for bestowing with their love and respect, and that he considered it his duty to serve for their greater good. His kingdom was divided into Pradesha or provinces which were subdivided into Vishyas or subdivisions and Janapadas, which were further subdivided into villages.The five chief provinces under Ashoka\u2019s reign were the Uttarapatha(Northern Province) with its capital at Taxila; Avantiratha (western province) with its headquarters at Ujjain; Prachyapatha (eastern province) with its centre at Toshali and the Dakshinapatha (southern province) with its capital as Suvarnagiri. The central province, Magadha with its capital at Pataliputra was the administrative centre of the empire. Each province was granted partial autonomy at the hand of a crown prince who was responsible for controlling the overall law enforcement, but the emperor himself retained much of the financial and administrative controls. These provincial heads were altered from time to time to prevent any one of them exerting power over a long period of time. He appointed several Pativedakas or reporters, who would report to him the general and public affairs, leading the king to take necessary steps. Although Ashoka built his empire on the principles of non-violence, he followed the instructions outlined in the Arthashastra for the characters of the Perfect King. He introduced legal reforms like Danda Samahara and Vyavahara Samahara, clearly pointing out to his subjects the way of life that is to be led by them. The overall judicial and administration were overseen by Amatyas or civil servants whose functions were clearly delineated by the Emperor. The Akshapataladhyaksha was in charge of currency and accounts of the entire administration. The Akaradhyaksha was in-charge of mining and other metallurgical endeavours. The Sulkadhyaksa was in charge of collecting the taxes. The Panyadhyaksha was controller of commerce. The Sitadhyaksha was in charge of agriculture. The emperor employed a network of spies who offered him tactical advantages in diplomatic matters. The administration conducted regular census along with other information as caste and occupation. Religious Policy: Ashoka\u2019s Dhamma Ashoka made Buddhism the state religion around 260 B.C. He was perhaps the first emperor in history of India who tried to establish a Buddhist polity by implementing the Dasa Raja Dharma or the ten precepts outlined by Lord Buddha himself as the duty of a perfect ruler. They are enumerated as: 1.To be liberal and avoid selfishness 2. To maintain a high moral character 3. To be prepared to sacrifice one's own pleasure for the well-being of the subjects 4. To be honest and maintain absolute integrity 5. To be kind and gentle 6. To lead a simple life for the subjects to emulate 7. To be free from hatred of any kind 8. To exercise non-violence 9. To practice patience 10. To respect public opinion to promote peace and harmony Based on these 10 principles preached by Lord Buddha, Ashoka dictated the practice of Dharma that became the backbone of his philanthropic and tolerant administration. Dharma was neither a new religion nor a new political philosophy. It was a way of life, outlined in a code of conduct and a set of principles that he encouraged his subjects to adopt to lead a peaceful and prosperous life. He undertook the propagation of these philosophies through publication of 14 edicts that he spread out throughout his empire.  Ashoka\u2019s Edicts: 1. No living being were to be slaughtered or sacrificed. 2. Medical care for human as well as animals throughout his Empire 3. Monks to tour the empire every five years teaching the principles of dharma to the common people. 4. One should always respect one\u2019s parents, priests and monks 5. Prisoners to be treated humanely 6. He encouraged his subjects to report to him their concerns regarding the welfare of the administration at all times no matter where he is or what he is doing. 7. He welcomed all religions as they desire self-control and purity of heart. 8. He encouraged his subjects to give to monks, Brahmans and to the needy. 9. Reverence for the dharma and a proper attitude towards teachers was considered better than marriage or other worldly celebrations, by the Emperor. 10. Emperor surmised that glory and fame count for nothing if people do not respect the dharma. 11. He considered giving the dharma to others is the best gift anyone can have. 12. Whoever praises his own religion, due to excessive devotion, and condemns others with the thought \"Let me glorify my own religion,\" only harms his own religion. Therefore contact (between religions) is good. 13. Ashoka preached that conquest by the dhamma is superior to conquest by force but if conquest by force is carried out, it should be 'forbearance and light punishment'. 14. The 14 edicts were written so that people might act in accordance with them. He got these 14 edicts engraved in stone pillars and slabs and had them placed at strategic places around his kingdom. Role in Dissemination of Buddhism Throughout his life, 'Asoka the Great' followed the policy of non-violence or ahimsa. Even the slaughter or mutilation of animals was abolished in his kingdom. He promoted the concept of vegetarianism. The caste system ceased to exist in his eyes and he treated all his subjects as equals. At the same time, each and every person was given the rights to freedom, tolerance, and equality. The third council of Buddhism was held under the patronage of Emperor Ashoka. He also supported the Vibhajjavada sub-school of the Sthaviravada sect, now known as the Pali Theravada. He sent missionaries to far of places to propagate the ideals of Buddhism and inspire people to live by the teachings of Lord Buddha. He even engaged members of the royal family, including his son and daughter, Mahendra and Sanghamitra, to carry out duties of Buddhist missionaries. His missionaries went to the below mentioned places - Seleucid Empire (Middle Asia), Egypt, Macedonia, Cyrene (Libya), and Epirus (Greece and Albania). He also sent dignitaries all over his empire to propagate his ideals of Dhamma based on Buddhist philosophy. Some of these are listed as follows: Kashmir - Gandhara MajjhantikaMahisamandala (Mysore) - MahadevaVanavasi (Tamil Nadu) - RakkhitaAparantaka (Gujarat and Sindh) - Yona DhammarakkhitaMaharattha (Maharashtra) - Mahadhammarakkhita\"Country of the Yona\" (Bactria/ Seleucid Empire) - MaharakkhitaHimavanta (Nepal) - MajjhimaSuvannabhumi (Thailand/ Myanmar) - Sona and UttaraLankadipa (Sri Lanka) - MahamahindaDemise After ruling over the Indian subcontinent for a period of approximately 40 years, the Great Emperor Asoka left for the holy abode in 232 BC. After his death, his empire lasted just fifty more years. Ashoka\u2019s Legacy Buddhist Emperor Asoka built thousands of Stupas and Viharas for Buddhist followers. One of his stupas, the Great Sanchi Stupa, has been declared as a World Heritage Site by UNECSO. The Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath has a four-lion capital, which was later adopted as the national emblem of the modern Indian republic. ",
