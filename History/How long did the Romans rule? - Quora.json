            "answer_text": "Well assuming you mean the Ancient Romans, they can split up into three major time periods: Roman KingdomRoman RepublicRoman EmpireThe Roman kingdom ruled from 753 BC to 509 BC. There was seven kings of Rome(Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus). At its extent the Roman Kingdom controlled Latium(the region around Rome). Eventually though the monarchy was  overthrown and replaced with the Republic. The Roman Republic was a somewhat proto-democratic superpower that encompassed much of the known world from Spain to Turkey. It lasted from 509 BC to 27 BC, but nothing is immortal and the republic became an empire.  The Roman Empire can be split into two major categories: Roman EmpireByzantium EmpireThe Roman Empire Enpire split in 395 AD into two empires the Eastren Roman Empire and the Westren Roman Empire. The Eastren Roman Empire eventually became(known as) the Byzantium Empire. The exact time periods were: United: 27 BC- 395 AD  West: 395 AD- 476 AD East: 395 AD- 1453 AD  Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a trick question, if you like. The Roman Empire is normally dated to have begun in 753 B.C.E. Now, it was founded as a Monarchy, which evolved into a Republic and eventually, an Empire. So skip those political labels and start as 753 B.C.E by Romulaus (twin of Remus). And you thought that was the trick part,; I guess, it sort of is. However the Roman Empire end date is 476 C.E. though, technically, some argue that the Roman Empire ended in with the fall of the Byzantine Empire with the fall of Constantinople in 1453 CE. I believe the 476 C.E date to be the most accurate date, it was the year that the Germanic tribes sacked Rome which never rebounded until the Renaissance. Prior to 476 C.E. all of Rome\u2019s authority, laws, court system and trade had been relocated to Constantinople and became the Byzantine Empire. Most if not all references to Rome faded with time.
