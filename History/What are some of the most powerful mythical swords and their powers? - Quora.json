            "answer_text": "In the Web Novel of the Rising of the Shield Hero the final antagonist has a sword skill that is unbelievably broken SPOILERS!!!!!  \u201cLet\u2019s see. 100% Deadly Aim, 100% Death,\u300eInfinity Destroyer\u300f. Yep, you\u2019re dead.\u201d (Medea) White, and black. Red was also mixed in. An infinite amount of lines circle. They merge into a single narrow beam, and fly towards me. Just like with the attack that killed Motoyasu, I can\u2019t follow it with my eyes. Yes\u2026 I guess you could call it death. It\u2019s like she materialized the concept of death itself. That\u2019s the sort of feeling I got. I don\u2019t know why I was able to see it. In truth, Medea\u2019s attack was much faster than my own sense of perception, so there\u2019s no way I should have been able to see it. It\u2019s as if she had bypassed the entire effect animation, leaving only the message \u300eEnemy has been Killed\u300f behind. A patchwork of time that left only the result. The final antagonist of the Web Novel is Medea Pideth Machina who had to merge 8 universes together just to sustain her existence Her most infamous attack is the Infinity Destroyer This sword attack is near impossible to evade do to the immeasurable speed. And when it makes contact, its guarantee a 100% death. However\u2026 it doesn\u2019t stop there Not only will the attack instantly kill the opponents by materializing the concept of death on the target(s) to end their lives but also imbued with the concept of \u201cbringing an end to all possibilities\u201c Destroying all your versions Past, present, future Every parallel world Every divergent world Every timeline Every universe/dimension All at the same time If this happens then your never coming back. No magic in the multiverse can resurrect you. None of those version will be there to avenge you GAME OVER Additionally the attack can also destroy the laws of the world and even the law of cause and effect ",

            "answer_text": "Very few mythological or literary swords were inherently magical or powerful beyond enhanced physical qualities (such as never rusting, breaking, or needing to be sharpened, or some amount of glowing). Some rarer magical \u2014 but not conventionally \u201cpowerful\u201d \u2014 traits in mythological weapons include rejecting or somehow attacking an unworthy wielder and minorly enhancing the fighting ability of their users by having perfect aim or something of the sort. Usually, the great magical feats accomplished with swords are actually due to the abilities of their wielders, with the sword channeling power somewhat like a wand or staff rather than being the actual source of the magic. Other times, mythological swords were seen as a symbol of power (and not inherently powerful, though the two are frequently confused) as is the case with Excalibur. There are a few \u2014 emphasis on few \u2014 mythical weapons that I know of that were meaningfully powerful beyond use as a physical weapon, but most are not swords or even applicable to swords. I think they tend to be more common in Norse and Irish mythologies, but I\u2019m no expert. There is a staff or something similar called Kaladanda in Hindu tradition that kills whoever it strikes. The club of Dagda also magically brought death, but also could be used to bring people back to life.Cupid\u2019s arrows made the target fall in love.Several weapons would magically return to their owners once used, such as Lugh\u2019s spear, certain arrows in Hindu tradition, and Thor\u2019s hammer Mjolnir.Dainsleif was a sword that was cursed (so, not sure if that\u2019s the sword\u2019s power or not) that couldn\u2019t be sheathed until it was used to kill somebody.",
