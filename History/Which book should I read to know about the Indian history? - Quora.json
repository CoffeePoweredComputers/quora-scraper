            "answer_text": "Indian History is Unique and extremely Complex and is approximately 3000 years old (maybe even older). In order to Know everything about the Indian History I would Recommend you to read \u2018 THE HISTORY AND CULTURE OF THE INDIAN PEOPLE\u2019. The book has 11 volumes and is written by the most respected Indian historian ever R.C. Majumdar. On the initiative of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, he took up the mantle of editing a multi-volume tome on Indian History. Starting in 1951 he worked for 26 years ,travelled extensilvely and took help from a number of historians to describe the Indian history and culture in 11 volumes. You can order each of the volumes online as they are hard to get everywhere. The 11 volumes are are as follows: Volume 1 : The Vedic age(up to 600 B.C). Volume 2 : The age of Imperial Unity(600 B.C - 3020 A.D). Volume 3 : The Classical age(320\u2013750 A.D). Volume 4 : The age of imperial Kanauj(750\u20131000 A.D). Volume 5 : The Struggle for Empire(1000\u20131300 A.D). Volume 6 : The Delhi sultanate(1300\u20131526 A.D). Volume 7 : The Mughal Empire(1526\u20131707 A.D). Volume 8 : The Maratha Supremacy(1707\u20131818 A.D). Volume 9 : British Paramountcy and Indian resistance, Part 1 (1818\u20131905 A.D). Volume 10 : British Paramountcy and Indian resistance, Part 2 (1818\u20131905 A.D). Volume 11 : Struggle for freedom (1905\u20131947 A.D). It may be a little expensive voyage as each book costs somewhere from 500 to a 1000 ,for example the first book cost me 700 Rupees on amazon and the second one 500, but its worth it, every claim in the book is backed by proof and if one is really interested in the history of India these 11 volumes are more than enough to truly know everthing about our country\u2019s past. Happy reading!! ",

            "answer_text": "Seeing this question reminds me of one of my professor\u2019s answer to a batch mate, who really was unaware of his (Prof.) illuminating wit .. \".. for passing or knowing or understanding \u201c.?? Everyone wasn't sure the prof. was pissed or really genuine with his reply. For Passing:- JPH( he even referred as Jaarur Paas Hoga), S.Chand's guidebooks, Xeroxed notes and copying of course.. Everyone wanted to laugh but wasn't so sure.!! Then He started, History is not simply a neutral discipline founded upon an immutable body of facts rather a cultural product within society reflecting an age's themes and context. Thus, History writing as a form narrative in society Constructs, Organizes, and Shares knowledge through a particular form of representation viz. Speech,Writing,Language, and Understanding or what in historical sense referred as DISCOURSE. Back then, for really knowing History there are lots of secondary sources available in numbers and mine is just a tip of the iceberg (sort) thing OK for Indian history.. So, for lay users to know abit of India Sunil khilnani \u2018 The idea of India'Ramachandra Guha \u2018 India after Gandhi \u2018E.H. Carr \u2018 what is history'E. Sreedharan \u2018 A textbook of historiography\u2019Jawaharlal Nehru \u2018 The discovery of India'All this books uld give a broad base in the factual tits-bits and a balanced view of India and history in general. So, from then on thematically and chronologically one can dive into the vast array of books available and read on and on. ANCIENT INDIA India: Historical beginnings and concept of Aryan' ed. Romila Thapar (NBT, INDIA)Ram Shanker Tripathi \u201c History of Ancient India'D.N Jha \u201c Early India: a Concise History \u201cA.S Altekar \u201c State and government in Ancient India \u201c.R.S. Sharma \u201c Aspects of political Ideas and institutions in Ancient India\u201dRomila Thapar \u2018 From lineage to state\u2019Romila Thapar \u2018 Cultural past' OUPList can go on and on but this books r enough to have a base or else wanna go deep look into each books mentioned above bibliography .. U uld get a Galaxy of books on ancient India on varying themes and school of thought. MEDIEVAL INDIA Irfan Habib \u2018 Medieval India: the study of a civilization' (NBT,INDIA )Satish Chandra \u2018 History of Medieval India' 800\u20131700 AD (Orient )Sunil Kumar \u2018 The emergence of the Delhi sultanate'The Cambridge economic history of India Vol-I ed. Tapan raychaudhuri, Irfan Habib.Irfan Habib \u2018 Agrarian system of Mughal India'Athar Ali \u2018 Mughal India'Shireen Moosvi \u2018 People , Taxation, and Trade in Mughal India'This are rudimentary secondary sources for a know-how into the affairs of the Medieval period. It is to be kept in mind that the vastness of the period is such that 10\u201320 books aren't enough to get a comprehensive picture so people go into various themes viz. Social, Economic, Political, and Cultural aspects separately to give a birds eye view. MODERN INDIA Barbara D. Metcalf and Thomas R. Metcalf \u2018 A concise history of India\u2019Sumit Sarkar \u2018 Modern India: writing social history'The Cambridge economic history of India Vol- II c.1757\u20132003Bipan Chandra \u2018 India's struggle for independence'Anil seal \u2018 The emergence of Indian nationalism'Rudrangshu mukherjee \u2018 The penguin Gandhi guide'Mushirul Hassan ed. \u2018 India's partition: process, strategy, mobilisation\u2019 OUPPoints to ponder upon:- India is a pluralistic society that creates magic with democracy, rule of law, community relations and Cultural diversity so to point out that this is the best book and of those sort is really illogical. Thus read upon and get enlightened what Historically we r so rich, and to explain in history this paradox makes Indian historical narrative very fulfilling.. Happy reading and hopefully understand the idea of India. Cheers ",
