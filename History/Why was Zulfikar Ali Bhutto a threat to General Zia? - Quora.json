            "answer_text": "Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, after he was released after first detention enjoyed great public support, he traveled from one part of the country to another and addressed people; the same people that supported the grand PNA (National Alliance of 9 Opposition parties) were now rallying around him. On the other hand was a military dictator with lust of power and new-found luxury that he wanted to enjoy enough before he could be removed, Bhutto was a big threat to his rule. He had promised elections within 90 days, and he had to fulfill it sooner or later to maintain moral support and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was doing homework as a prospective successor. So, Zia had to get rid of him, to rip people off a popular option. He arrested him, released him, and then again arrested him with a stronger accusation to face, until at last he found a dummy in form of Ahmad Kasuri, who encashed the death of his own father. Irony is, Z.A. Bhutto\u2019s involvement in murder was testified by witnesses who were kept in detention until they confessed. \u201cIt was a mock trial in a Kangaroo court\u201d said former US attorney General Ramsey Clark.

            "answer_text": "Gen Zia went ahead with the execution of Z.A. Bhutto because Bhutto was an unpredictable and brash politician. While many people doubt whether Gen Zia actually wanted to kill Bhutto because initially he treated him like he should treat an ex-PM while others say that a shrewd Zia's actions were stage-managed by him according to his master-script. Not many people remember that Gen Zia had released Bhutto twice after short detentions but rearrested him after Bhutto started turning his circumstances into an advantage.  Merely three weeks after Z.A. Bhutto was deposed by Gen. Zia, he was released and allowed to go free. Bhutto took advantage of his freedom and started organizing large scale protests. He'd travel by train and organize large rallies on the way at each station delaying the trains by several hours.  The same people of Pakistan who had rejoiced his dethroning only a few weeks earlier on charges of rigging elections started treating him like a hero. They started rallying round him and this of course was a threat to Gen Zia's rule. He therefore rearrested Bhutto within few weeks but once again released him few days later. May be Zia thought this threat was enough to force Bhutto to mend his ways. Bhutto did not oblige. Zia arrested him for the third time and this time on charges of murder. Months  later he was executed allegedly after a scripted trial. ",
