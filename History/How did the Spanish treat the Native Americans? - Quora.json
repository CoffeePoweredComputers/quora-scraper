            "answer_text": "I can only comment, mostly, on early Spanish colonialism. Queen Isabella had a strong interest in converting the native people\u2019s to Christianity, and pushed for the Native Americans to be treated as subjects, not slaves. Though, the difference between being a fuedal subject and slave at that time may not be as clear to us as it seemed to them (nor as clear to the people who were subjugated by the Spanish). Queen Isabela (From History of Indies, Book II, in a letter to Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando, the 3rd Governor of Hispaniola. ) In order to entice the cacique [\u201cIndian Chief\u201d] and his men to work as freemen and not as slaves, they must be given wages, they must be treated well (Christians should receive better treatment than non-Christians), allowing no one to harm or displease them in any way\u2026 But, the Spanish colonies were far away from direct oversight, and what actually happened was less than the Queen\u2019s ideal. Backing up somewhat, to the time when Columbus and his brothers, Diego and Bartolomew, were governing the colonies. Columbus and his brothers Diego and Bartolomew (who governed the colonies in his absense) had at least put some limits on use of native labor, because one of the main demands of a group of men rebelled after his 2nd voyage was that these limits be removed, and Columbus eventually capitulated to their demands.[1] But while he treated the natives more like feudal subjects (made to work, but only for a part of the year, and on their own land), he considered captives from conflicts fair game for enslaving, outright, and selling. On his 3rd journey, after putting down an \u201cIndian\u201d rebellion (evidence that the natives had indeed been harmed and displeased), he sent 600 native captives to Spain as slaves. Isabella sent those that survived the trip back, saying she wanted subjects, not slaves. Even in this period slaving was happening by the various other Spaniards. In a letter Columbus spoke of the \u201cslavers\u201d who go after young girls. Many have used this quote to say he was encouraging or involved in this activity, but he was writing this in a letter listing the wrongdoings of colonists who had accused him of crimes. This was an example he was using of their bad character (truely or falsely\u2026but I do not doubt it was happening in light of other accounts), and right after it he said they didn\u2019t \u201cdeserve water in the sight of God\u201d (ie, they deserve to die). [2] After Columbus was relieved of his governorship (because of the rebellions and complaints against him), things got worse for the natives on Hispaniola under Bobadilla. Bartolome de las Casas, a priest who arrived with Ovando at the end of Bobadilla\u2019s governorship, describes how he allowed the men free use of the native people, not just as servants, but allowing them to take native women \u201cby consent or by force,\u201d and even to kill them for sport (History of the Indies, Book II, Chap I). After Queen Isabella\u2019s death things did not get better. Massacres, rapes, torture, and other atrocities were common throughout this period of Spanish conquest in other places as well. You can read more about these in Bartolome de las Casas \u201cA Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies.\u201d Indiscriminate slaving of natives became rampant during this period. Whole islands were depopulated. Las Casas describes scene that remind me of later descriptions of the trans-African slave trade\u2026 They used to stuff shipholds with hundreds of Indians of both sexes and all ages, pack them like sardines and close all the hatchways to prevent escape thus shutting off air and light. And, since ships carried food and water only for the Spanish crew the Indians died and were thrown into the sea, and the floating corpses were so numerous that a ship could find its course by them alone. (History of the Indies, Book II, Chap 44) While lip service was still given to converting the natives, and giving them the opportunity to be subjects, not slaves\u2026documents like the the Requerimiento show how this was often nothing but pretense. This letter was read to natives the Spanish encountered, usually in Spanish (which the natives did not understand). It briefly explained Christianity and that God had given these lands to the crown, and said that if you did not accept their rule, that\u2026. \u2026we shall powerfully enter into your country, and shall make war against you in all ways and manners that we can, and shall subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church and of their Highnesses; we shall take you and your wives and your children, and shall make slaves of them, and as such shall sell and dispose of them as their Highnesses may command; and we shall take away your goods, and shall do you all the mischief and damage that we can, as to vassals who do not obey.[3] This is all from 1492 to about the mid 1500s. My understanding, from talking with people who have studied later Spanish history (which I have not), is that things gradually got better, so that in the 1800s native Americans were fleeing to Mexican and Spanish territories because they were treated better there than the US, and that Native Americans intermarried with the Spanish and were eventually fully integrated into society (those that survived those early years, I assume). I know during these early years even there was a lot of work done by priests to end the atrocities against the native people, and recognize their humanity (though other factions in the church were working against that). Things like the \u201cRequerimiendo\u201d were meant to appease them (it didn\u2019t work). So, that was probably one reason things eventually got better\u2026but it was very bad for a long time before that.

            "answer_text": "The English Hispanic historian, John Lynch wrote: The Spanish Empire WAS NOT A WICKED EMPIRE, and I think that is the best definition I read. Spaniards can be tough, terrible when they get angry, and capable of anything, but they aren't BAD. To compare, the Russians knew that once the Spaniards settled in their villages, they had nothing to fear, after the first initial furor. With the Germans you never knew. That is the difference between the Spanish Empire and others. With difficulties, with errors, they tried to make a Christian Empire, with the best wishes of the Kings, usually ignored by the conquerors who wanted only wealth, but the concern was sincere for their indigenous subjects. Did they commit terrible acts? Yes, but in a historical context that approved almost any act in order to expand the Christian Faith. ",
