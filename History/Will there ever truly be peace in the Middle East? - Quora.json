            "answer_text": "Yes. The words of Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, immortalized by Bob Marley are relevant here: Until the philosophy which hold one race superior And another Inferior Is finally And permanently Discredited And abandoned - Everywhere is war - That until there no longer First class and second class citizens of any nation Until the colour of a man's skin Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes - Me say war. That until the basic human rights Are equally guaranteed to all, Without regard to race - Dis a war. Well, everywhere is war - War in the east, War in the west, War up north, War down south - War - war - Rumours of war. And until that day, The African continent Will not know peace, We Africans will fight - we find it necessary - And we know we shall win As we are confident In the victory of good over evil. The so-called \u201cMiddle East\u201d is North Africa and Southwest Asia, perhaps stretching into Central Asia if one considers Afghanistan, scene of an ongoing US military occupation since 2001, now part of the so-called Middle East. The wars there are a function of \u201cWestern\u201d and US colonialism, militarism and imperialism, fomenting divide and conquer tactics and techniques among the indigenous populations. Eventually, there will be a no-state solution to all the conflicts. War-mongering and repressive regimes created and imposed by the West, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, will be abolished and consigned to the dust-heap or dung-heap of history. The use of fossil fuels will be ended by humanity in the interests of planetary survival and re-forestation and the protection of irreplaceable water resources will be a shared communal and collective responsibility instead of a \u201ccausus belli\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Nope. There never was, there never will be. \u201cPeace\u201d is the absence of wars, but \u201cwar\u201d is not the only problem of the Middle East. Wars in the Middle East usually start between dictators (and Israel). Now you see those dictatorships falling apart and most of it is replaced by tribalist anarchy. The Arabs are not a single community, but thousands of small groups, divided in region, culture, clan and religious affiliations. Why in Syria there are 1000+ groups fighting? Why in Palestine and Lebanon every political party has its own paramilitary force? Loyalty is one of the strongest and weakest values in the Arab World. They can\u2019t form a single body, to whom everyone is loyal, there will always be people seeking local control. An example for this is the clan-disputes in Israel. In the Israeli-Arab villages, most of the communities are separated to different clans (\u201cHamula\u201d in Arabic), and when there are local elections, the member of the largest clan will always win and neglect the others. Honour is a major factor here. There is rivalry between the clans in many aspects of life and it is almost every week that there is inter-clan violance. In the Bedouin community it is even worse, as they are not only members of a large family, but members of tribes, who have more obligations to their fellows, and when two tribes are having a conflict, it tends to be brutal. Only last year there were incidents of clashes between Arab clans in two villages in Israel that resulted in dozens of injuries and even deaths. One incident included a Nice-style attack on members of the other clan. When Clans are not fighting each other (Which is usually the case, I hope I didn\u2019t make you think that there is constant violence between all clans all the time), they are still separated. One thing I noticed is that despite the fact Arabs are less in number than Jews, they have more political parties. In the Israeli parliament the Arabs represent only ~10% of the seats, but 33% of the political parties (they are now in a single list but can\u2019t agree on anything). The Palestinians and Israeli-Arabs have many more news websites, each concerning a local area; they hardly have any general news sites. In Syria, as mentioned before, the situation is even worse. Where you have thousands of millitant groups, fighting for control and despite the fact most of them are allied into one group, inter-alliance fights occur all the time. The same happens in Iraq as well. The only way to preserve order in the Middle Eastern Arab countries (North Africa is a different topic) is through dictatorships and no one wants dictatorships. It will take more than at least 200 years for the Middle East to change. ",
