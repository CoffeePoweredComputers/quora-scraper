            "answer_text": "Ronald Reagan is one of the most loved Presidents ever. When he died, there was a spontaneous procession of people in California that lined the road for 20 mi. It was not planned. It was not a showpiece. People showed up to bid him farewell. It was spontaneous. Why? President Reagan was a straight shooter. He was the real deal. People liked him. When Reagan passed his tax plan, which was a reduction in taxes, he called all the members of Congress late into the night many evenings, and talked to them, soliciting them individually. He did the same thing with the peace treaty with the Russians. They came to the table with stack of papers which were the issues of the peace agreement. Reagan set that aside and spoke directly to the Russians. They weren't used to that. He let the diplomats work out the rest. When Reagan was shot, he said to the secret service, \u201cI forgot to duck.\u201d Reagan was the real deal. People appreciated that. When he was in the hospital, after being shot, the story goes that Jesus Christ appeared to him and said he had to forgive the person that shot him. Reagan did. He did not hold it personally against him. He was an amazing President. He loved the United States of America. He thought that it was the land of the free and the home of the brave, and he definitely embodied that ideal. ",

            "answer_text": "He\u2019s loved and revered\u2014and hated. Few merely like or dislike him. Conservatives revere him as their standard bearer, the one who brought conservative thought into the national conversation. And of course, he was elected president twice\u2014which conservatives viewed as an irrefutable vindication of his ideas. Others view him as a fraud, a pied piper, an ignoramus, an elitist, a racist, an oppressor of the poor, etc. Who\u2019s right? Reagan\u2019s domestic agenda was to cut taxes and spending, believing that would lead to economic growth. What followed was a nasty recession\u2014followed by a historic period of extraordinary growth. His approach to foreign policy was to draw clear lines of distinction between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Someone asked him what he envisioned for the end of the Cold War. Reagan responded, \u201cWe win. They lose.\u201d The result? A historic rapprochement with the Soviet Union\u2014followed by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union\u2019s eventual collapse. Even those who hate his guts can\u2019t deny these accomplishments. So they resort to caricatures: he hated poor people and blacks; he was a shill for the rich; he was senile; he was a spineless puppet for his wife, etc. The debate goes on. ",
