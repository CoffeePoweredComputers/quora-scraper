            "answer_text": "The Romans borrowed, as other civilizations borrowed, from earlier calendars. Egyptian, Greek, Hebrew, Assyrian, Babylonian, and Sumerian. The Sumerian calendar was one of the earliest documented calendars. It was used to advise farmers about when to plant, harvest, etc as well as marking holy days from several religions. The Roman calendar started during the kingdom years and was probably used in the same way as other calendars or the ancient world. As the Roman Kingdom was overthrown and became the Roman Republic, the calendar also became a political tool the Senate played with all the time. The Roman Republic calendar was replaced by the Julian calendar decreed by dictator Julius Caesar and that was a political tool more than a way to advise farmers about planting, harvesting, etc or marking holy days. It was a way to control the Senate and his new Roman Empire. The Julian calendar was a matter match between the lunar cycles (29 to 30 days each) and the solar year (12 lunar cycles) and made the calendar corrections - the leap day - an automated process. The average citizen, however, didn\u2019t really feel the impact.  Q: How does the invention of the Roman calendar impact society? ",

            "answer_text": "Though most of the month names are derived from it, the original Roman calendar had no impact on society: like other calendars of the time, it had dates which fell at different times of the year in different years and had to use an occasional extra month to bring it into rough line with the seasons. The Julian calendar, worked out by Hellenized Egyptian priests and imposed on Rome by Julius Caesar, had the minor effect of making the periodical proclamations of an extra month unnecessary so that through the next few centuries you could tell what time of year it was by the day of the month. The change was not enough to \u201cimpact\u201d society; it was merely a convenience. ",
