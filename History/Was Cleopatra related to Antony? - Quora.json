            "answer_text": "No. Antony was a Roman from an aristocratic family, and Cleopatra was a member of the Macedonian Ptolemy family that had ruled Egypt since the time of Alexander the Great. Cleopatra was Antony\u2019s fourth wife and they had several children together including the twins Helios and Selene (son and moon.) Antony and Cleopatra each killed themselves after being defeated by Octavian (Augustus) at the battle of Actium in 31 B.C. He fell on his sword and she killed herself with an asp bite. Their young children were taken to Rome and raised in the home of Octavian\u2019s sister Octavia, who had been Antony\u2019s third wife. Cleopatra\u2019s sixteen year old son by Julius Caesar, Caesarion, was put to death as Octavian thought that he might be a potential rival for power. ",
