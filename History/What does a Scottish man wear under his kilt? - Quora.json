            "answer_text": "There was a Scottish guy at University when I was there, but he never wore a kilt, though he spoke with a Scottish accent. I remember one day some of the sillier girls got hold of him and started asking him questions. He took it well until about the end. I think it was on St Andrew\u2019s Day or some Scottish celebration. The conversation went something like this. Why aren\u2019t you wearing your kilt today? I don\u2019t have a kilt. Why not? I don\u2019t want one. Aren\u2019t Scottish men supposed to wear kilts? We hardly wear them in Scottish cities, except on special occasions. But this is a special occasion! We\u2019re not in Scotland, are we? Silly giggles, and then - Do guys wear anything underneath their kilts? (More silly giggles.) Some do and some don\u2019t. But we want to see you wearing a kilt, why don\u2019t you ever wear one? Because I don\u2019t want a lot of silly girls asking if I am wearing anything underneath! End of conversation. I can only give one (sort of) example from my own experience. When I was a teenager we went to a fair that had some Scottish dancing, men in kilts. It was on a stage and the kilts would fly up at times, and it seemed that the men wore matching tartan shorts under their kilts. But there was a very cute boy among them who seemed to be about nine or ten, and once or twice when he was dancing we could see he was wearing white underpants underneath, it was so cute. I teach a dancing group at school where we learn traditional dances from different countries, and I am thinking of going into traditional Scottish dancing (the music will have to come from CDs or other recordings as we have no bagpipes! That was another thing the university girls teased the Scottish guy about.) We will have to try to find the costumes as usual. This is elementary school so there shouldn\u2019t be any problem with wearing. I will naturally require the boys to wear their usual underwear underneath, white if they have them as this attracts less comment if shown. ",

Most other kilt (in Welsh cilt) wearers are pretty sensible; it\u2019s weather-related, on the whole. As for me, I don\u2019t require any undergarments when I\u2019m wearing my cilt. EDIT: as an addition I ought to add that if you put your hand up a Scotsmans kilt, & cop feel a of a quarter-pounder, you\u2019ve just met one of the McDonalds. ",
