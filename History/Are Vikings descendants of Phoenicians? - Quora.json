            "answer_text": "Vikings and Phoenicians were blood brothers under their skin, both utilizing the sea as their highway. But if you mean are they linguistically or culturally closely related, well I must answer with a \u201cno\u201d, vikings speaking an Indo European language, that being the old north Germanic tongue called Old Norse, whilst the Phoenicians spoke a now dead semetic language, likely related very closely to Arabic and Hebrew. But again, these two peoples \u2014 and their progeny, were elite explorers, sailors, navigators, both semi expansionist adventurers, capable, because of their untold wealth gained from their shrewd dealings with \u201cenemies\u201d, both capable of colonization, and in the Phoenician case, giving rise to a progeny far mightier than the original mother country, Phoenicia, and this sterling nation was non other than mighty Carthage herself, who fought a protracted, titanic clash with Rome that saw the end of Carthage, but it took the mighty Romans three punic wars to finally be able to roar, \u201cCarthago delenda est.\u201d Or \u201cCarthage must be wiped off the face of the earth,\u201d and they WERE. Delenda cognate with our own word \u201cdelete\u201d and thus meaning most specifically \u201cCarthage must be DELETED.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The Vikings existed in the pre-modern era, but they were the last remnant of the advanced civilisations of ancient times. The Phoenicians were from Lebanon and settled colonies in Europe, North Africa, and Anatolia. They were originally a non-Indo European people. The Basque, the Maltese, the Berbers, the Finns, and Magyars all speak a non-Indo European language and all have distinctive Nordic traits. Clearly these people arrived in Europe long before other European peoples.  Both knew Iron SmithingBoth were maritime raiders and colonistsBoth share many of the same haplogrouops (M, N, U, & R)",

            "answer_text": "I would say they have common descendants in the very remote past, say five thousand years, BCE. That is because Europe was settled by mainly two groups after the end of the LGM, or Ice Age. One was from Mesopotamia, and they were the \u201crich\u201d city builders, agriculturalists and livestock breeders, and the other was the \u201cTurkic\u201d peoples from Siberia. The Vikings descended from groups of both categories that reached the coast of the Baltic Sea and Scandinavia, and then returned repeatedly, first as settlers of the Great Northern European Coastal Plain as the weather continued to warm and become more favorable for agriculture, and then as Vikings and \u201cGerman\u201d traders. The Phoenicians were identified with the Western Coast of the Mediterranean, an area where Mesopotamians would settle or pass through in their movements into Anatolia and the Mediterranean coastal cities. Something like that. I don\u2019t just want to toss your question as too remote in its implications. ",

Hannibal is behind the Siege of Saguntum in Iberia (Spain), in which he killed every single person in the town. That brought about the Second Punic War with Rome. Carthaginians might also be behind the disappearance of Tartessos. Both had similar ships. Both used runes. Futhark is related to Phoenician runes. Both were infamous to surrounding ethnics. ",
