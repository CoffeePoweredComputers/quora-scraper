            "answer_text": "German soldiers, or at least combat soldiers, seldom killed Jews. Besides the SS commandants and guards of concentration and extermination camps, the killing of Jews was mostly done by Einsatzgruppen killing squads with the help of police battalions and local collaborators. I wouldn\u2019t call any of these German soldiers, and I wouldn\u2019t want my uncle Obergefreiter Ernst August Schmidt to be mentioned alongside these people. That said, it is a fact that the Wehrmacht in the occupied Soviet territories was well informed about and cooperative with the genocide of the Jews. In his Severity Order, Generalfeldmarschall Walther von Reichenau urged his troops \"fully to appreciate the necessity for the severe but just retribution that must be meted out to the subhuman species of Jewry\". A similar order was issued by Erich von Manstein, whose troops participated in the Simferopol Massacres in December 1941. Trucks of the Einsatzgruppe and the army, busses and also smaller booty vehicles were used to quickly bring the victims to an anti-tank ditch outside Simferopol, where they were shot. Wehrmacht soldiers also participated in the shooting. The Wehrmacht was also involved in the Babi Yar Massacre on 29 & 30 September 1941. According to Activity report USSR no. 97 of the RSHA of 28 September 1941, the Wehrmacht had approved or even insisted on the massacre: \"As has been proven, Jews were significantly involved in the arsons. Allegedly 150,000 Jews here. Confirmation of these figures has not been possible yet. 1,600 arrests were made in the course of the first action. Measures were started to register the entire Jewish population. Execution of at least 50,000 Jews is planned. Wehrmacht welcomes measures and demands radical action.\" The Wehrmacht sometimes saved Jews, however, mostly because it needed their labor. For instance, it was also the Wehrmacht that prevented the complete annihilation of Lithuania\u2019s Jews in 1941, as was mentioned in the Jaeger Report: I can state today that the goal of solving the Jewish problem for Lithuania has been achieved by Einsatzkommando 3. In Lithuania, there are no more Jews, other than the Work Jews, including their families. They are: \t\tIn Schaulen\t\taround   4,500\u00a0\t\tIn Kauen\t\t  \u201c     15,000\u00a0\t\tIn Wilna\t\t  \u201c     15,000\u00a0I also wanted to kill these Work Jews, including their families, which however brought upon me acrimonious challenges from the civil administration (the Reichskommisar) and the army and caused the prohibition: the Work Jews and their families are not to be shot! More rarely individual Wehrmacht officers or soldiers spoke up against the slaughter or saved Jews. One who spoke up was Helmuth Groscurth, later a member of the German resistance. One who saved Jews was Karl Plagge. Wehrmacht units that participated in the mass killing of Jews were essentially rear area security divisions, most notoriously the 707th Infantry Division. The members of these units were not combat-worthy soldiers and not capable of much besides killing helpless civilians. They were occassionally successful against partisans, like in Operation Hornung and Operation Cottbus, but also there most of those killed were civilians. Where they met the Red Army they were overrun and annihilated with comparative ease. I don\u2019t know of any case where a member of a Wehrmacht security division refused an order to kill civilians. However, there were cases where members of police battalions would no longer continue killing. But that was not for reasons of conscience, it was just because their nerves could no longer stand the bloodbaths. Thus the Simferopol Massacres in December 1941 had to be postponed because the policemen of the 4th Company of Police Reserve Battalion 9, who had assisted Einsatzgruppe D in its massacres since the beginning of the Russian campaign, were tired of killing and had requested being given another duty. Their request had been granted, and Otto Ohlendorf, the commander of this Einsatzgruppe, had to wait for the replacement unit, the 3rd Company of Police Reserve Batallion 3, to arrive at Simferopol in order to carry out the massacres. Einsatzgruppen members themselves sometimes broke down under the strain of constant killing. One such case, mentioned in my article Between Scylla and Charybdis, was Martin Mundsch\u00fctz of Einsatzkommando 12. He was mocked by his comrades as the \u00bbAustrian wimp\u00ab, became increasingly depressed, had thoughts of suicide and finally asked Ohlendorf in a \u00bbcomradely\u00ab conversation to be relieved from the Einsatzgruppe and sent back home. An understanding Ohlendorf sent Mundsch\u00fctz back home and recommended his internment in the SS neurological sanatorium in Munich. Mundsch\u00fctz returned to Austria and, after some neurological examinations, was able to take up again his work at the Innsbruck criminal police without restrictions. In postwar trials, especially before courts of the German Federal Republic, defendants often claimed that they had acted under Befehlsnotstand, fearing that they would be harshly punished or even executed if they refused to carry out orders to kill civilians, especially Jews. However, there is no proven case where anyone refusing to obey such orders faced any severe punishment. German combat troops, again, were a different kind of people, less inclined to kill defenseless civilians, though they also did so on occasion and were as prone as their opponents to not taking prisoners in battle or killing them on the spot, especially in the early days of the conflict. When the Wehrmacht was besieging Leningrad, not in order to force its surrender but with the intention to get rid of its population, the Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres) on 28.09.1941 issued an order to shoot down any civilians who tried to leave the city towards the German lines. The Head of the General Staff of Army Group North, after a front line trip to the 18th Army, wrote the following in a file note dated 24.10.1941 (my translation): At all visited entities the question was addressed how to behave if the city of Leningrad should offer its surrender and how to behave in regard to the population streaming out of the city. The impression arose that the troops have the highest concerns in regard to this moment. The commander of the 58th Infantry Division pointed out that in his division he had given the order received from higher above, which corresponds to the instructions issued that such pretensions are to be fired on so as to strangle them at birth. He was of the opinion that the troops would also carry out this order. He doubted, however, whether they would keep the nerve to shoot again and again on women and children and defenseless elder men in case of repeated breakouts. It is worth noticing his utterance that he was not afraid of the military situation on the whole, which especially at his wing near Uritzk is always tense, but that the situation in regard to the civilian population always caused fear.This, he said, was not the case only with him, but also down to troop level. The troops fully understood that the millions of people encircled in Leningrad could not be fed by us without this having a negative impact on the food situation in our own country. For this reason the German soldier would also prevent such pretensions by force of arms. This, however, could only too easily lead to the German soldier losing his inner posture, i.e. not shying from such acts of violence even after the war. The commanders and troops are eagerly trying to find another solution but have not yet found a feasible one so far. So the greatest concern among German officers and soldiers in front of Leningrad was not the enemy, but the prospect of having to shoot down defenseless civilians. The solution suggested in order to spare the troops this traumatic experience was to use artillery. In the War Diary of the General Command of L. Army Corps the following was stated under 24.10.1941: The commanding general visited a number of firing positions of heavy and light batteries of artillery regiment 269. The commanding general viewed the installations for the winter and the construction of emplacements and then discussed with the commanders and battery leaders the use of the artillery in case of the Russian civilian population trying to break out of Leningrad. According to army order of 18.9.1941 Nr. 2737/41 secret, such attempts are to be prevented, if necessary by force of arms. It is the task of the artillery to fend of any such undertaking as far away as possible from our own lines by opening fire at an early stage, so that the infantry is as far as possible spared having to shoot on civilians. Fortunately there were no such breakout attempts. The siege of Leningrad was horrible enough without them. ",

            "answer_text": "Several generals were sacked as they objected to the atrocities taking place in Eastern Front. Each time one general brought it up he was immediately relieved from his post and another more ideologically motivated and ruthless Nazi was selected as replacement.  The SS - Schutzstaffel - had specialized \u2018task forces\u2019 or death squads hand picked from the most sadistic and zealous Nazis in order to ensure that they would not falter as they relentlessly butchered their way across East Europe.  Even the Nazis realized that your average Nazi or German soldier might refuse and even potentially mutiny in some cases when ordered to murder women and children. So they worked their way around this \u201cproblem\u201d of some of their soldiers being \u201ctoo human\u201d - or too \u201cweak\u201d as the Nazis would put it. In their internal rhetoric the sadistic criminals they picked to murder civilians were called \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201chaving sufficient resolve to do what is needed\u201d - the Nazi higher ups preached of the necessity to commit large scale genocide against peoples they viewed inferior to themselves. And when people who were fed with chivalric notions of heroic war such as the German ace Marseille - who was also using his influence to protect a black POW from mistreatment - found out what was going on they did in fact openly mutiny. Marseille for instance was called to Berlin to receive a medal from Hitler himself. He got a rough idea of what was going on in Berlin and the ace literally went AWOL with Gestapo being tasked to find him and return him to his unit, which they did as they found him hiding in Italy. Others went even further and committed high treason through various conspiracies to murder Adolf Hitler.  The famous national hero and general Rommel was forced to commit suicide in the aftermath of the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler with a bomb. One case of mutiny involved the flight of Jews from Germany via boats - no German patrol boats were available that night to intercept the refugees as \u201cthey were all being painted\u201d. Then there\u2019s the case of Wilhelm Canaris  Wilhelm Canaris - Wikipedia He was the head of German military intelligence service - he was initially a supporter of Hitler but soon found himself unable to support the madman and used his position as the leader of military intelligence to help Allies - their enemies - another case of high treason for moral causes. Eventually he was caught and executed. So yes, there were a number of Germans who gave their lives to oppose Hitler. It is cruelty of history that they ultimately failed to stop the enemy of mankind.
