            "answer_text": "In Sikhism, since its foundation in 15th century, there was and is just a Sikh (non-baptized) and Khalsa Sikh (baptized). There is no other kind. Khalsa Sikhs are the baptized Sikhs when Guru Gobind Singh created the brotherhood of the Khalsa, emerging with a unique and irresistible identity in 1699. Guru Granth Sahib is considered the one and the only holy book and the last forever Guru as authorized by Guru Gobind Singh himself and all true Sikhs/Khalsa follow it. The tenth guru decided that it was important for the Sikhs to be able to defend their faith and he formed a brotherhood called the Khalsa of devoted Sikhs who were willing to defend their faith even at the expense of their lives. They have to take part in the Amrit ceremony held by five exemplary community members. There are five symbolic aspects of the dress of members of the Khalsa: uncut hair which symbolizes the belief in not disturbing nature anymore than necessary; a wooden comb for neatness; white shorts to wear under clothes for purity and modesty; a steel bangle for strength and eternity; and a short sword as a reminder to defend the truth and what is right. Sanatan Sikh was created as new religious movement in 1873. The founding members of this movement aligned with British during the 1857 rebellion. For their support and alliance, British awarded the founding members with vast amount of property and royalty. This movement included Udasis and Nirmala pandits who created and publicized Dasam Granth as their main text, claiming it to be written by Guru Gobind Singh himself. J.D. Malcolm created several images for the book. They were also responsible for planting idols in Golden Temple. There were more than 30 different versions of Dasam Granth created due to Nirmala pandits changing and modifying its contents. This movement was highly unpopular among the Sikhs and mostly ignored by general population. One of the founders, Khem Singh Bedi began to consider himself the 11th Guru which eventually led to the downfall of the movement and eradication of Sanatan Sikh by end of 19th century.

            "answer_text": "I don't think many people realise, is that both of the main Singh Sabhas (Tat Khalsa and Sanatan) came into being to create a distinct Sikh identity. Sanatan/Puratan Sikhs do believe in the 1 God Mahakaal/Akal Purakh, yet they believe in the existence and revering of other gods such as Chandi or Shiv. The \u201cMonotheism\u201d of Sanatan Sikhs is completely different from the Abrahamic religions e.g. Islam, Christianity or Judaism. As explained above Sanatan Sikh monotheism is worship of one God, Akal Purakh, with reverence of other gods, along with the Guru Sahibaan. Sanatan Sikhs still continue Puratan (ancient) Sikh practices such as Shastar Puja (weapons-reverence), Aarti Aarta, and Jhatka of goats, which is still performed at Anandpur Sahib, Takht Sri Hazur Sahib and such. Sri Dasam Granth Sahib Ji and Sri Sarbloh Granth Sahib Ji are at the side of the SGGS Ji by the Sanatan Singhs. The definition of \u2018Sahajdhari\u2019 by the Sanatan Singhs is one who cuts hair as of now, or one who is not raised in the Sikh religion, but one who will take Amrit and be immersed in the Sikh religion eventually. Therefore, we can conclude, that Sanatan Singhs are Sikhs. The Sanatan Singh Sabha was formed in Amritsar to protect Sikhs and Hindus from the proselytising of the Christians and the Ahmadiyyas in the late 1800s-early 1900s. While Khem Singh Bedi did call himself as the Living Guru, he had no real governance over the Nihang Singhs or the Nirmala Singhs. As the Nihang and Nirmala Singhs take Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji to be our Guru. The Tat Khalsa Singh Sabha was created to create a distinct identity for the Sikhs from the Arya Samaj. But their actions are in many ways condemnable. Kartar Singh Jhabbar, a famous Tat Khalsa leader, threw the Budha Dal(Nihang Singhs) out of the Akal Takht, pierced the Saroop of Sri Dasam Granth Sahib Ji out of the Akal Takht Sahib. However Nihang Singhs, nirmala Singhs etc etc are Khalsa Sikhs as they all have taken Amrit. ",
