            "answer_text": "Working from home increases productivity by about 30%, reduces turnover (that can be 15% of operating costs) and burnout (sometimes 30% of the workforce, improves health (people eat better, get more exercise, less stress, sleep an hour more, and don\u2019t endlessly catch colds and flus from co-workers), think better without the stream of interruptions, and it reduces the interpersonal stresses from office politics, status-seeking, gossip, sexual harassment, bullying, faction-building, etc.. This was known before the pandemic but not believed by most managers until forced to try this enmasse (steadily ignoring all sorts of data and common sense to maintain an illusory sense of close control by aloofly gazing at their worker bees and heavy tracking of most irrelevant metrics says a great deal about how useful the managers actually were (at enormous cost) and what the real \u201cspan of control\u201d is now. Shifting workforce away from the central site means it\u2019s time to lease much smaller space or sublet some of the space you own (unless there\u2019s something more productive as a profit center that you could fit into your now empty space.) It also means being able to hire people from far away (talent vs. proximity, or proximity to a market instead of the boss) that\u2019s been going on forever in sales and increasingly in IT, now it\u2019s become clear most other jobs can be done with non-local people (but preferably not the cheapest call center worldwide that one can find.) Business debt has never been cheaper and equity investors, remaining naive and expecting far too high of returns, have perhaps 500% or more of the cash in hand for viable opportunities. Too much capital, a case for about 20 years now, is unique in world history and especially for everywhere outside of a few world financial centers. Using YouTube and other online training tools is a huge opportunity, especially given how few companies train their employees at all (ask your HR about training, fire them after they explain how they\u2019ve never had the time to do more than onboarding, let alone work out 1950\u2019s state of the art career paths with tools to grow your employees into ever more valuable performers who appreciate that bet on their future.) Outsourcing accounting, human resources, benefits administration, IT hardware and software services as well as network admin and cybersecurity, and bringing operations and production more fully inhouse are long, pre-pandemic trends that make sense and are against what Business Schools teach (which have gotten us to quite a mess.)

            "answer_text": "Easy. I'm a successful serial entrepreneur in the small/niche service industry and will speak from that angle. Lots of businesses have gone under during this time. Big or small, many of them had at least one great /unique angle that kept them thriving under normal (pre-pandemic) market conditions. These various clever/unique trade practices are not the reason they went under. It was their inability to remain profitable /sustainable under a litany of other challenges, such as huge overhead, such as fleets of trucks, expensive rent, executive infrastructure, etc. Just because they weren't able to stay alive under these extremely difficult times doesn't mean that they were \u201cweak\u201d. Therefore, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Adopt and incorporate, (not steal), some of those unique features into your own presumably much smaller and streamlined service business. For example, if XYZ Emporium was known for their chicken scented hair care products, then replace the lavender fragrance in your products with fried chicken and other meats. The point is that you don't need to have a billion dollar infrastructure to put the mouth watering aroma of roast turkey in your hair conditioner. Me? I'm in the speciality chandelier industry. All refurbished/restored rare high end fixtures. I never had the financial resources, nor desire, to be a retailer of modern fixtures. The huge investment into inventory is a nightmare I was never willing to gamble on. But now that so many of those warehouse retailers have gone under, I can look at what their top sellers were, buy those pieces at firesale prices, and sell them for double. How? Those fixtures are now much harder to find since most of the sellers are gone now. And I only have inventory that I'm confidant is going to sell. Open your mind, and look very closely at what was working well for the now bankrupt major players in your industry. I'm certain you'll find lots of proven products and strategies that you can incorporate into your own business. Especially since you're not plagiarizing the major players if they're no longer in business. You're actually providing a popular offering that became unavailable when the big players went under. ",

            "answer_text": "The art of recovering after a recession is re-positioning and adaptability. Ever noticed how some people make a lot of money in a recession? That\u2019s because for every winner, there\u2019s a loser. As business owners, we want to make sure our business is a winner. Here\u2019s how: Recessions polarize the markets, they separate the good companies from the bad. This isn\u2019t about cashflow or who has the deepest pockets, though. The actions you take today, tomorrow, and over the next few months will make the decision of success or failure. Many business owners believe that if they cut costs and manage cashflow, they will slowly survive and come out the other end. Maybe the business will survive but you will still have lost huge amounts of business. Winning in a recession is about adapting to the new market. Your customers have different amounts of disposable income, different interests, and a different outlook on the world from a year ago. Take risks, seize opportunity, and be the fast-moving speedboat in a world of sinking ships. If you own a yoga studio, you can either struggle to pay the rent, or launch online classes. Chances are the online classes will make your business more profitable than ever. Invest in new opportunities, marketing, and equipment when everyone else is cutting expenses. A recession like this one is the greatest opportunity business owners ever have. Don\u2019t make yourself regret missing out. ~Elliot. ",
