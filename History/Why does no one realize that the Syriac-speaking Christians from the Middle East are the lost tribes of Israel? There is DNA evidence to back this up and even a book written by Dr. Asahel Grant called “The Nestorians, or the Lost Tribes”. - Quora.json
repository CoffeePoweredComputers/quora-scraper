            "answer_text": "It is well known that most of the population of the northern Israelite tribes was exiled and scattered around other parts of the Assyrian empire (which in this case means primarily the area of modern-day Syria and northwestern Iraq). That was standard Assyrian practice in conquests, to destroy the national integrity of conquered peoples and minimise their chances of mobilising and rebelling against Assyrian rule. But such upheavals were regular occurrences throughout human history and can never be the basis for modern nationality\u2014otherwise, half of Britain would be entitled to German or Danish citizenship, the Celts of Ireland would have claim to be Hungarians or French, many Russians could claim to be Scandinavians, etc. Besides, in the nearly three thousand years that have elapsed since then, those ancestral Israelites became thoroughly mixed within the local population and other nations that were exiled there for other parts of greater Assyria. Unlike the Jews of Yemen, for example, or Iraq, Iran, or Ethiopia, they did not maintain a persistent and self-contained cultural community that could be identified and re-associated with modern-day Israel. Even if they did, it\u2019s unlikely they would have been accepted today as long-lost brethen in Israel, because\u2014despite its name and its claim to all the territories of biblical Israelite tribes\u2014the modern-day Israel state is founded exclusively on the descendants of the tribe/kingdom of Judea, which agreed to absorb refugees from the north at the time of the Assyrian conquest (725 BCE), but not thereafter (as evident from the attitude of the Judeans toward the Samaritans after returning from Babylonian exile, around 525 BCE).

That is why you can have an ancestry DNA Test and it will show if you carry Jewish DNA or not. You can have an DNA Ancestry Test and it will show you if you are an Assyrian, Chaldean in origin because these peoples carry unique Haplogroups going back to the ancient Assyrians, Chaldeans written about in the Bible. Assyrian has a DNA which shows she originated in ancient Assyria, not Israel:  Syriac Christianity - Wikipedia ",
