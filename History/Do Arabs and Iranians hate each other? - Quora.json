            "answer_text": "This question keeps coming up on my feed, but only using different words: \u201cDo Iranians hate Arabs?\u201d\u201cWhy do Iranians hate Arabs?\u201d\u201cDo Arabs hate Iranians?\u201d\u201cWhy do Arabs hate Iranians?\u201dThese questions need to stop, I as Iranian (well American with Iranian background) do not hate Arabs, I have had many Arab friends living in America. One of my best friends in North Caroline named Waleed Abu-Salah was an Arab. Many Quorans I like such as Ahmad Kadan (\u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u06af\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0646), Ahmad El-Sheikh (\u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u062e), Ahmed Rabee' (\u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0639), Ahmed Abdelhaq Zaydan, Sana Khoury, Salwa Halabia, Ziaddin\u00e8 Chahoudi and others that I have probably forgotten are Arabs. What about Gulf Arabs? I assume this question has to due to Proxy War between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Well for me personally, the war plays a very little impact on my life. Second, despite the conflict, I doubt the conflict effects the opinions of rational folks in both countries. I like Abdulaziz Al Meajel, he\u2019s a Gulf Arab from Kuwait, I think I initially got off to a bad start with him, but were not cool with one another. And as for citizens of Saudi Arabia, well there are things about Saudi Arabia that I find very reprehensible, but I have nothing against any ordinary citizen of the Kingdom. They are just people trying live their lives, like Iranians. I don\u2019t get why many Westerns seem to think that Arabs and Iranians are each other\u2019s natural enemies. There are certainly people of both sides, such as Sunni extremist, Arab Nazis, Pseudo-Persian Nationalists, etc, who proudly boast their hatred of the other group on social media. But they are fringe minority among both ethnic groups, just as White Nationalists are among White Americans and Afro-Centrists among Black Americans. In case I get the \u201cIranians hate Arabs because of the 7th Century Arab Invasion\u201d comment from Orientalists, I will let you know that three centuries before the Arab Conquest of Persia, that Persians also victimized Arabs. In 325 AD, the Sassassind Shah Shapur II launched a campaign in Eastern Arabia that resulted into ethnic cleansing of several Arab tribes, primary the Iyad, Taghlib, Banu Bakr, Banu Abdul Qays, Banu Tamim, and Banu Hanzalah. And after the campaign Shapur II wanted to Arab tribes further West, so he built a wall and made the Arabs pay for it. Note: I am kidding about paying for the wall part Shapur II's Arab campaign - Wikipedia Sasanian defense lines - Wikipedia So as you now know, Iranians are not the innocent victim bystander in antiquity. Most Iranians don\u2019t want to be painted by Orientalists as the civilized Persians who were brutality conquered by primitive savage camel jockeys. Iran has been invaded by many empires. Alexander the Great conquered Persia and massacred the entire population of Persepolis, yet most Iranians have no ill will against modern Greek people. Genghis Khan conquered Persia and massacred around 75\u201390% of Persia\u2019s population, yet most Iranians have to ill will against modern Mongolian people. The Brits and the Russians during WWI caused a famine that killed around 8\u201310 Million Iranians, yet most Iranians have no ill will against either British or Russian people. Solh \u0635\u0644\u062d and Salaam \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 to everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some good answers here. I share my perspective. The hatred towards Arabs from Iranians, is three fold: LanguageReligionHistory1. Language We Iranians are really proud of our language. Persian is among the top ten old languages of the world. And relative to Latin or German languages, we changed very little. The invasion of Arabs in 7th century, resulted in a very dramatic change in Persian. We adopted Arabic alphabet, we adopted many Arabic words and even Parsi, (which is also the name of our language) changed to Farsi, because Arabs couldn't pronounce P. The changes were so dramatic that almost killed Persian. But some poets, writers, and kings, intervened. Today, as an Islamic country, studying Arabic, is mandatory in school. And the method of learning, is almost 100 years out of date. So it is among one of the most hated classes between students.  2. Religion As Arabs invaded Iran, they injected their religion as well. Islam. It was not much of a problem (though in that time many were killed, but we can count that as a result of war and invasion.) But when Safavid got the power in Iran, The change to Shiite Islam became mandatory. As Safavid wanted to unite people against Turkey, in which time, there was a war in between. That passed and then came the Iranian revolution in which resulted in a dictatorship with the doctarian of Islam. And many were killed by the name of Islam. They were not killed because of Islam though. But when you mention Islam as your motif when you mass-murder, It gets to people. And Islam generally is linked to Arabs. So, there goes the hatred from that perspective. 3. History Iran as an old civilization had many kings coming and going. But the most glorious ones were ones that were ended by invasion of Arabs. And at that time, the Great Persia, started to shrink down and loose its power and humanism.   And to add to other points, there is the problem that comes from revolutions, which cause extremism, which cause bigotry and with that comes racism.   But in General I can say that, in popular culture, there is not much hatred towards Arabs, as there is towards mandatory Islam and mandatory Arabic.

            "answer_text": "Everybody is listing the reasons for the bitter emotions amongst Arabs and Persians, but I\u2019m going to tell you about my very personal experience. So let\u2019s start with my childhood. At that age, I had no idea of human diversity and consequently had no idea of the existence of Arab or Persian ethnicities. I was born right after the Iran-Iraq war. All that I can remember was the memorial of martyrs on the state TV. Along with these programs, there were some other programs about the Palestine-Israel conflict; so I just mixed it up and thought that Palestine is part of Iran and Israel is another name of Iraq :) Apart from that, I used to hear some of our relatives were living and working in Kuwait and Dubai. Those who were working in Kuwait were called Kuwaiti and it was relatively synonym of wealthy because they could earn so much money and send it back home. Again I thought of Kuwait and Dubai as some cities in Iran! So no knowledge of Arabs yet. Then when did I get to know there are some people, different from us, called Arabs? Well, it all started with football. The first matches I can recall are 2002 world cup qualifications. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain were Arab teams in our group. In Tehran, IRN beat SA and since the commentator was overjoyed I found out that it wasn\u2019t an ordinary match. In Riyadh, it was a draw, but at the moments the SA was the victorious team, from what commentator said, I learnt it\u2019s so shameful to lose against SA! After that, the most important match was IRN-BHRN, even with a draw Iran could get qualified for the world cup. But to everybody\u2019s surprise, IRN lost the match and Bahraini players and some of their fans waved SA\u2019s flag (that win didn\u2019t benefit Bahrain, it just paved the way for SA to get qualified for the world cup). If it was up to me, I wouldn\u2019t have got offended, but from what the commentator and other mature football fans said I learnt it was so offensive and I should be outraged. Before this, I used to think the only enemies that we had were the USA and Israel, and all the Muslim countries are on our side. But after these matches, I learnt that being Muslim is not the thing that unites us, but the race and language are of much more importance. As time elapsed and I grew up, from what I read in history books and heard on the news, I learnt it was Arabs who invaded us in Iran-Iraq war (not Israel) and it wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d invaded. Some said a Saudi Mufti has a fatwa that you\u2019d be rewarded if you kill or rape a Shia. They said another Mufti had said I wish for a day when Persians are beggars in our streets. I read a book named \"two centuries of silence\" in which Arab conquest of Persia was narrated in a dark theme (I think I\u2019d better point it out that, despite the claims about Iranian government being anti-Arab, it was completely the opposite. In our textbooks, we read that Sassanid kings were incompetents, so when the Persians were offered the new faith, they accepted it with open arms. Besides that, I frequently heard from our clerics that they wish for the unity of the Muslim world). So despite all I\u2019d learnt about our tumultuous history of our nation with Arabs, I expected Arabs and all the Muslim countries to be on our side against our non-Muslim enemies. But it wasn\u2019t realistic and I learnt it when the news of wiki leaks came out and there was some evidence of SA\u2019s conspiracy against Iran. I would laugh at my feelings at that time. I felt like I had been betrayed and I had the same feeling when SA raised its oil production to foil the effect of Iran\u2019s sanctions (I had no idea of a political and economic rivalry between the two). And I found out our enemies even have military bases in our neighbouring countries. The Arab Spring and its aftermath made these negative attitudes even stronger. Not that I support Iran\u2019s policies in the Arab countries. I just find it unfair to only blame Iran for its so-called ambitions. Every Arab citizen I\u2019ve come across has had a very biased opinion on this matter. While Persians admit their government destructive role in the region, Arabs consider themselves purely as innocent. To be honest our complaints about our government\u2019s interference in other countries is for our own sake. There\u2019s a popular slogan in Iranian\u2019s demonstrations which says \"no to Gaza, no to Lebanon, I will sacrifice my life for Iran\". There are some other disputable matters amongst Arabs and Persians, including the UAE claims about our Islands and the name of the Persian Gulf. But believe me, as far as I know, there\u2019s no religious basis to these sentiments. I read in many responses that the root of this bitterness is Shia-Sunni conflicts, but I guarantee that it\u2019s not. Many Iranians are far less religious than what people assume. These non-religious Persians don\u2019t care about religion (be it Shia, Sunni or even atheist), and about religious ones you can\u2019t say they hate Arabs at all, they have some complaints about some Arab countries\u2019 policies but you never hear them saying we hate Arabs. So in conclusion, if you ask me: why do you have bitter feelings against Arabs? I would say: because I found out they dislike us. But does it mean I would disrespect them or mistreat them when I meet? No, not at all. A year ago my Arab friend (Iranian Arab) had a guest from Iraq. he wasn\u2019t pro-Iran (even maybe anti-Iran), he just came over to see my friend. Knowing that, we all were more than hospitable toward him. We showed him around and even got angry when someone overcharged him. Who knows?! maybe all this bitterness is restricted to the internet :D ",

So, what\u2019s give? Algerians (that\u2019s me too): Cool, I have no problem with Iran. In fact we do have good tie comparing with Saudi Arabia. That doesn\u2019t mean we trust Iran either, due to they finance Islamist terrors at 1990s.Moroccans: aren\u2019t they sponsoring terrorism in Moroccan Sahara? We are also real defenders of Islam, not those Magi fuss. Long live KSA!Tunisians: beautiful, but it is a mystery. We are neutral though.Mauritanians: we don\u2019t give a damn.Libyans: what? Iran? How do we know? They were friends of Gaddafi, damn them all!Egyptians: we are both ancient civilizations but the stupid mollahs want to ruin us.Sudanese: we used to have many Iranians there.Chadians: no idea.Somalis: no idea.Djiboutians: no idea.Yemenis: when will Iran get the hell out of our country and cede their support for Houthis? Leave us alone!Omanis: excellent. We do business with them everyday.Emiratis: we have many Iranians, we are fine, but we hate how they meddled on our jobs. Give us islands back.Bahrainis: Iranians said we have similar facial to them. How? We are Shiites but not Iranians. Long live KSA!Qataris: they can serve as counter-balance against our annoying neighbors. At least we are independent, and Iran can do good for us.Saudis: how many Iranian terrorists please?Iraqis: we Shiites like them, but Sunnis hate them.Kuwaitis: we have no problem with Iran except they meddle too much on our job.Jordanians: why don\u2019t Iran stop interfering anyway?Lebanese: more divided. Shiites and Christians are okay with Iran. Not Sunni Lebanese of course. We at least trust Iran, but not okay if they want to station too long.Palestinians: we love Iran! Thank you Iran for supporting against when those Gulf traitors backstab us.Syrians: pro-Assad hails Iran, anti-Assad hates Iran. Syrian innocents blame both.Comorians: where?You see that? Opinion in there are also extremely divided between groups and groups. I am an Arab-Amazigh from the Maghreb. I feel Iran okay, because we have nothing to hate each other, even though our people tend to take side if they need. However, those like from Gulfs are mainly anti-Iran. Those from Levant are more divided. People of Jordan will claim Iran as an interfering nation. Palestinians think them liberators; Egyptians feel sad for the lost of Iranian civilization; Sudanese just need money. But I have no hatred against Iranians at all. We have nothing to do against them. However, depend on which position, it would be divided. ",

            "answer_text": " As you can see, the Muslims conquered a lot of regions during the 7th and 8th century, including Persia. During this time, Arabic became widespread in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula. This was necessary, because the Umayyad empire was Islamic, and its system was based on the caliphate. It\u2019s important to note that nationalism is absolutely forbidden in Islam, and that the spread of Arabic in the Umayyad empire had nothing to do with nationalism. The prophet Muhammad - peace and blessings be upon him - was an Arabian, and to be more precise, he was a descendant of the prophet Ismael, and Ismael is the son of the prophet Abraham - peace be upon them. The Jews also descend from the prophet Abraham, albeit not from his son Ismael, but from his other son Isaaq - peace be upon him. This is the reason why both Arabs and Jews are known as Semitic people. Since the prophet Muhammad was Arabian, and the message, which he conveyed to the people in the Arabian Peninsula was in Arabic, it\u2019s pretty obvious as to why the Muslims were learning Arabic during that time. According to Islamic scholars, it was important that Arabic was taught to every Muslim - both men and women - so that they could understand the Qur\u2019an and the narrations about the prophet Muhammad - peace be upon him. A lot of Persians became Muslim, and the non-Muslim Persians were also tolerated in the Umayyad empire. Keep also in mind that Persians were mostly Sunnis before the Persian conversion to Shi\u2019ism began in the 16th century, which would have dramatic consequences.  This man is known as \u2018Shah Ismail\u2019, he was the first Safavid ruler of Persia during the 16th century. He wanted to convert all the Sunni Persians to Shi\u2019ism, and what he did was unprecedented, because he forced all the Persians to become Shi\u2019ites, and whoever refused to convert, would be executed instantaneously. This kind of oppression was a nightmare to the Sunnis, and I honestly feel very sad for all those Sunnis who lived in Persia during that time. As time past, the Persians and Arabs no longer had any connection with each other. Arabs were mostly against Shi\u2019ism due to the fact that Shi\u2019ism contains a lot of polytheistic ideas, which are considered to be anti-Islamic. The fourth caliph Ali - may Allaah be pleased with him - didn\u2019t invite people to get worshiped, but despite this, the Shi\u2019ites insisted on worshiping him. Another act of disbelief, which the Shi\u2019ites also did, was that they cursed the spouse of the prophet Muhammad, and they also cursed the first 3 caliphs. There are many more acts of disbelief that are very common among Shi\u2019ites, but in spite of this, they still claim to be Muslim. It baffles me when I hear them call themselves Muslim, because they\u2019ve actually rejected the tenets of Islam. The hatred that you asked about has nothing to do with race, I can assure you that. It\u2019s about the clash between the Sunnis and the Shi\u2019ites. Honestly, if the Shi\u2019ites nowadays would become Sunnis, then the tension would go away, no doubt about it. May Allaah guide the Shi\u2019ites to the straight path, amin. Greetings, Faysel ",

            "answer_text": "Iranians feel differently about Arabs in each period. If tension becomes more as a political result they will start to hate Arabs these days Saudis are under the radar like the mina tragedy that more than 400 Iranians died. Example in my city ahvaz Arabs and other ethnics don't have much problems intermarriages is very common between people so hate isn't much in our society and we don't see such things in our daily life we are very cool with our persian countrymen and friends and most people of Iran see Iranian Arabs very warm and friendly people in my opinion they categorize Arabs in three groups Iranian Arabs( positive view) arabized countries like Morocco, Algeria, Libya,...( neutral view) and the Peninsula Arabs (negative view). So why there is such negative view toward Peninsula Arabs? Religion and language This is mostly among Nationalists who hate the Arabs for invading persia murdered and inslaved many people and forced the religion on Persians and forbidden persian language for two centuries. these people are mostly pro shah who live in America and western countries and still some of them are in Iran these people are not much but they are increasing. There are some shia religious people who dislike wahabi and salafi ideologies which are supported by countries like Qatar, saudi Arabia, uae... They don't like the people who follow such ideologies and most of these people are arabs. Our government is corrupted and does some stuff in the name of islam which some Iranians dislike them and some strict rules that exist they do many things in name of islam and when people see their failure they blame islam( when u think of islam u will have an image of Arabs cause it was brought by them and it's related to their culture) so it makes a negative sense There are other reasons like Iran Iraq war which most arab countries supported saddam hussein example yaser arafat supported saddam so that made a negative view of Palestine for Iranians or Egyptian pilots volunteered for helping saddam army and so on it was 8 years of a bloody war so forgetting about it is a bit hard And the behavior of some rich Arabs in Gulf countries which some of these people look so arrogant bc they got alot of money and didn't work for it( i hate such people and even some of my arab friends in other countries hate these Gulf Arabs too so it's not that surprising that Iranians hate them) and lets not forget changing the name of Persian Gulf to Arabian Gulf that made alot of problems between these nations But with all these things Iranians will be friendly and nice to Arabs who visit iran and they will try to communicate with them to understand how do they feel about eachother and they will have a nice chat together that's an experience which one of my persian freinds had with one of pilgrims who was going to mashhad. Our country is a very interesting and beautiful and if our government tries to show it better it can attract many Muslim and Arabs to here and people can have more communications and reduce the negative thoughts and it would be something to fix our economy. With all these things I said these negative feelings isn't true about all Iranians and some of them don't feel negative about Arabs and it can be reduced it mostly depends on political situation. ",

            "answer_text": "Mmmm! Pretty much, yeah! If you asked me this question two years ago, I would\u2019ve said: No! What a terrible thing to say! But I think Iranians hate Arabs in general since forever and all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten the bitterness they hold for Arabs for stepping onto their land almost 1500 years ago and influencing their language, culture, and religion. Though the leaders of the Arab army must have included the three most beloved Imams; Ali and his sons, and though their culture flourished in the Islamic golden age. I actually believe one of the reasons they adopted the Shia sect was the convenience of being Muslim and still allowed (encouraged) to hate Omar and other first old Muslims whom they hold responsible for the almost Arabic alphabet they use today. Gulf countries are usually ruled by Arabs, who, on the other hand, do return the favor and share almost the same feelings except maybe with less bitterness. They were blissfully unaware of how serious those feelings were, but thanks to satellite regular people everywhere are very aware of them. However, those feelings can be embraced and kept for domestic use as they were, which would be much wiser. if it weren\u2019t for the media (and especially USA international media, which of course doesn\u2019t mean any harm), it would probably have been a much better situation. Of course, the other Arab countries differ but most of them are not concerned with the whole thing. As I said in the first line I was unaware of the whole thing until I spent some time on Quora and started noticing how friendly some Iranians were when referring to Arabs in their answers, so maybe there\u2019s a vice versa, though I haven't come across any myself. I find it sad that both parties are not focussing on what they have in common instead. However, I wish during that time everybody let go of passive feelings and wish each other safety and health. ",

            "answer_text": "As a cosmopolitan Iranian who has always loved his country,culture etc and respects if not loves others as well(including Arabic culture) I feel obliged to answer this; Not all Iranians hold any sort of resentment or bias against Arabs and more importantly majority of those who do have a biased view on them don\u2019t \u201chate\u201d them but look down on them or just don\u2019t like them thus their ill mentality and attitude is far less hazardous to our Arab brothers and sisters than their Islamophobic counterparts in other parts of the world! most of the enlightened and open minded Iranians DO ACCEPT that we do have a lot in common compared to Europeans or other trendy idols of modern civilization(a simple but lovely example is how we kiss when we greet!). Even someone like me who isn\u2019t really keen on \u201cIslamic brotherhood\u201d( I\u2019m not religious and have my own criticisms of the current situation in Islamic world),know and appraise many Arab personages(from Khalil Gibran and Ahmed Zewail to Ibn al-haytham and Ibn-khaldun) and respect a lot of my fellow homo sapiens who bear the label Arab by birth.This respect and fondness of mine for semintic cultures is not alien with my roots,if you look at history you can trace it in the likes of sibawayah who wrote the first book of arabic grammar(obviously to smooth the way of learing this beautiful language for other non-arab muslims easier), in hafez,saadi and rumi (prominent figures of persian classic poetry) who loved to ornament their poems with arabic verses and in the seminal romance story of two Arab lovers Layla & Majnun in persian literature! But unfortunately,there is a growing inclination toward redefining Iraninan patriotism adherence to superiority of Iranisn (mostly preislamic)civilization to that of \u201csavage invaders\u201d who \u201creached to no height but the top of the ruins of the privious nations!\u201d . This line of thought ,if can be considered as one, is all about belittling our Islamic heritage and disrespecting and underrating other cultures in area,Especially Arabic culture . This boastfil outlook was formed during Pahlavi reign as a resault of contact with german facism but was ferociously rejected by 1979 revolutionists,in a way that ended up humbling and humiliating our non-Islamic Identity and heritage!the islamic regime dosen\u2019t embrace nationalism at all and if there happens to appear a slight reference to iranian culture it\u2019s about \u201cislamic-iranian culture\u201d and paying tribute to persian thinkers contributions to islam! Goddamn frustrating for an iranian, isn\u2019t it? Now The rest is easy!Anti-Islamic republic guys love to show their disapproval going the exact way of rhe regime. ",

            "answer_text": "Some do, Some Don\u2019t. Some Arabs (and some Non-Arab Muslim Countries) Don\u2019t hate Persians just because they are Persians, They hate\u2019em because some Iranis hold the same Ideology that the Current Iranian government has. They hate\u2019em because of Iran\u2019s continuous interference in Arabian Gulf\u2019s Personal Affairs and continuous efforts to support terrorist organisations like Hezbollah who aim to overthrow the Arab Regime. (No one likes when someone tells them what to do and what not to do.) They hate the constant threatening from Iran\u2019s government to close the Strait of Hormuz . They hate\u2019em for criticizing Arab countries for favoring Western countries like U.S. and U.K. for Military purposes (calling U.S. the great Satan) but on the contrary is doing the same thing with the help of China and Russia. There\u2019s also the cultural differences and Historic wars between these two groups and let\u2019s not forget that a significant amount of these two parts of the world constitutes of Muslims with Arabs favoring mostly Sunni Islam and Persians Favoring Shi\u2019ite Islam which leads to Ideological differences as well.  \u201cPersians will never forget their defeat at the hands of Arabs in the Battle of Qadisiya 1,400 years ago. It is as if a fire keeps seething under the ashes and is waiting for the right moment to explode,\u201d he said. Iran\u2019s attempts to gain supremacy in the region are not triggered by political ambition as much as by a racist drive that pushes Iranians to prove they are superior, the professor said. \u201cWhenever Iran issues any fiery statement about our neighbors in the U.A.E, Qatar, or Kuwait, you can easily detect that they revolve around a belief that Persians are superior. Listen to our foreign minister, parliament speaker, or even mosque imams, and you will notice that derogatory tone they use and which focuses on the racial and not the political superiority of Persians.\u201d (-Iranian intellectual Sadek Zibakalam) http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/09/170927.html  The only Arab country that support Iran(Government not people) are Syria and Azerbaijan. Lebanon has it\u2019s political system constituting of Hezbollah militants so \u2026 The Reason why Saudi stopped sending military Aid to Lebanon. Saqib Ghani's answer to Why has Saudi Arabia cut 4 billion dollars in aid to Lebanon's security services? In Short, Some Arabs hate Iranis because of these 5 main reasons : -Cultural Differences -Historic Wars -Ideological Differences -Political Alliances -Religion differences  Your Friends probably see you as a Friend and don\u2019t care much about your Political view or what Faith you subscribe to. P.S. I have a lot of Irani Friends too and when we meet we don\u2019t always talk about politics we do what friends do \u2026 Fun :D . ",

            "answer_text": "There are four different ways to answer this question. Are there Arabs who hate Iranians? Yes there are. I remember when Muhammed Morsi made his visit to Iran, there were rumours about Shia Islam spreading to Egypt. Of course this is an absurd and baseless rumour, but it\u2019s an example based on my personal experience. You\u2019ve also got Arabs who hate Iranians on the basis of the \u201cAhwazi independence movement\u201d. Are there Arabs who like Iranians? Yes there are. Shiites in Iraq view Iranian Shiites as brothers separated by borders. There are a lot more Arabs who view Iranians as friends on the basis of religion. And of course there are Arabs who sympathize with Iranians and wish to see an end to the Islamic Republic. I personally like Iran (not the government) and its people. Are there Iranians who hate Arabs? Yes there are. I\u2019ve seen a lot of Iranians who hate Arabs on Quora making absurd and baseless accusations. One Quoran in particular accused Arabs of \u201cstealing Iranian music because they\u2019re jealous.\u201d Others have decided to blame Arabs for the overthrowing of the Shah despite there being no evidence of Arab involvement in 1979. Are there Iranians who like Arabs? Yes there are. Again, there are Iranians who like Arabs on a religious basis, viewing Shiite Arabs as allies. Then you\u2019ve got the Iranian government, which likes Arabs so much that they\u2019re spending more money on militias in the Middle-East than on their own citizens \u2014 of course I\u2019m exaggerating, they\u2019re not really doing it out of love for the Arabs.  I answered this question in four different ways just to prove to you that there is no overall consensus. There are Indians and Pakistanis who hate each other and others who like each other. There are Mexicans and Americans who hate each other and others who like each other. The list goes on, but hopefully you understand my point. ",

Palestine,Syria and Lebanon: We like them and are fond of their cuisine,music \u2026 .But we don\u2019t like the fact that our government spend too much money and resources on them while we have lots of domestic problems. So nothing personal about the people. Gulf Arabs(Qatar,UAE,Kuwait and \u2026):There is an stereotype that they are rich and over prievlaged just because they have oil and they do not deserve all this wealth because they haven\u2019t worked hard for it. So the general view about them is not very positive but it is not due to racism and stuff. Oman:Good culture and civilizations and reliable allies.Somehow the most favorite Arab among us.(After Ahwazi and Abadani people of course.We love them.Persians tend to like them more than other Iranian ethnicities,actually.They have a very friendly culture and are the least racist ethnicity in Iran). Egypt:There was a cult Iranian Tv series not long ago\u201dJoseph the prophet\u201d which took place in ancient Egypt. So when we hear about Egypt that is what that comes to our minds:The ancient civilizations,Pharoes,Pyramids and \u2026 . Some people don\u2019t even know they speak Arabic and to be honest we don\u2019t consider them Arabs. Jordan:Neutral to positive. North African Arabic nations:I admit that I don\u2019t know much about those countries(Not unlike many Iranians) ",

            "answer_text": "I think the word hate is little bit to harsh. I'm an Iranian and I don't hate any groups of people. Arabs, Chinese, Germans, Americans and etc are all humans. We are all one race. We are all humans sharing one home which is our earth. Hating some other people is not a good idea. We have already seen what hatred leads to. Just Google WW1 or WW2 and you will see if you haven't already.  I agree Iranians regardless of their ethnicity don't have a good image of Arabic people in their mind. Why? There are many reasons. I'll explain it one by one. When we hear the word Arab in Iran we automatically think of the following events: Arab invasion of Sasanian Iran in the 7th century which lasted for two centuries.Iraqi invasion of Iran by the Saddam Hussein.Saudi Arabia's policy on spending millions of dollars to change the historical name of Persian Gulf.UAE's policy on claiming Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf.As you can see Iranians clearly don't have good memories with Arabs. I hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s like any other nations and it is partly because of stereotypes and xenophobia. It also varies from person to person; For example, Shias in Iran have almost good relation with Shias in Iraq or other places. However, it\u2019s not the case of non or less religious people, which are majority and are increasing in Iran. Some people admire any progressive nation; so, some Iranians may admire Jews and Israelis more than GCC countries. Yet, some may admire GCC countries for their progress in economy or building Mega cities. Iranians have some memory of Arab conquest of Iran, but I don\u2019t think it has a strong role in their attitude; The problem is that they see the continuation of this cultural difference, rivalry and hatred from the other side. We shouldn\u2019t forget that Saddam once tried to invade Iran and named it the battle of Ghadesieh (Muslim conquest of Iran). However, many Iranians soon forgot this aggression and currently they have a neutral or positive attitude to Iraqi people. On the other side, some aspects of the Saudi Arabia regime and the fundamentalist groups are almost hated by most people, and not only by Iranians. However, the main problem as I said is xenophobia. Some Iranians not only hate Arabs, but any religious person, even Iranian ones. Some even don\u2019t consider Mullahs Iranians, but representative of Arab religion and culture. However, most of these Mullahs or religious people are moderate and ordinary people. I personally don\u2019t know much about Arabs and their culture. They are not in movies or series. So, we may be familiar with Europeans or Turks more than Arabs. And those we see on media are mainly religious preachers or extremists like Bin ladan. It seems that Iranians historically never have seen things as strict as Arabs. We don\u2019t understand some of Islamic laws, which could have rooted in Arab history and culture (you know which ones I say). However, as I said, in this respect, we opposed to any radical person, whether he is Arab or Iranian. Then again, we may associate these radical Iranians to Arabs \u2014 as some of them state that they are descendants of some Arabs or Imams. It's not per se a problem, as we are not racist, but being indifferent to Iranian culture and identity by some of them makes them unpopular Muhammad was an Arab; so some Iranians may simply ignore him; but I think it is more difficult for Arabs (especially from Arabia); Muhammad and Islam is part of their identity, and they have sometimes a nationalistic attitude toward their religion. It\u2019s why ISIS or wahhabist accuse Shias or Iranians of non-believers and non-Muslims. But it\u2019s more due to xenophobia, and the lack of information; Moderate Arabs can be found; the moderate Iranians and Arabs could try to overcome the extremists and radical ones and make a progressive and developed Middle East. We feel that we need unity because we are all Middle Eastern and have some common enemies. We should try to understand each other more, and get more close to each other. When it happened Iranians and Arabs will become good friends of each other. ",

They also bombed the American compounds in Riyadh and brain washed the Shiite minority in SA to oppose the government along with killing many innocent police officers. They also torched our embassy in their country. We never attacked them or murdered any Iranians. We don't go on street screaming \u2018Death to Iran\u2019. King Abdullah actually went to Tehran before because he want a peaceful Middle East. But they didn't listen, they didn't even listen to America or any other countries either.

The most hate you will see is usually between Sunni Arabs and Shia Iranians. I believe they aren't hateful because of their religious differences, but because of what their governments tell them. Sunni Arabs in Saudi Arabia and other gulf states are raised with negative impressions of Iranians and their version of Islam which is Shia. In Iran the people are raised to have a negative impression of Sunni Arabs, especially in Saudi Arabia and Wahhabism. Shia Iranians and Shia Arabs get along quite fine. Present-day Iraq and Iran are a perfect example of this. As for Sunni Iranians, they exist but their numbers aren't significant enough for people to starting hating them so I really don't have anything to say about them. Believe it or not, many Shia Iranians and Sunni Arabs get along without any problems. So I guess you could say some Sunni Arabs hate Shia Iranians and vice versa but definitely not all. ",

There are hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of Sayyids in Iran, whom are descendants of Muhammad (pbuh), and clearly Arabs as well as Persians. There are also countless Persians (although not necessarily Iranians) living in almost all Arab countries. They have emigrated from Persian countries such as Afghanistan.  To conclude, yet the hatred exists, but it is not as strong as one might believe. And also not as important. ",

They were friends and now that Saudis and Israelis are given a go to become a power in the middle east, they\u2019ve become enemies What Saudis and Israelis have learned the hard way is that the west didn\u2019t help them in their defeats against Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria etc. On the other hand, Iran has been working with middle east nations as far back as 7th century BC. That\u2019s a couple years before I was even born. So this is a foolish attempt to want to try and breaks these relationships in this fantasized hegemony.

Even today, we call descendants of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) Seyed (Arabic for sir) and respect them highly. To some Iranians, me included, we and some Arabic nations are regarded as different branches of the same tree. For instance, Iraq was the capital of Iran for about a thousand years. Even the Iraqi capital of Baghdad was a Persian town near Sasanian\u2019s capital of Ctesiphon. The name is even Persian Bagh + dad means given by God. Also, as the Quran says, all Muslims are Brothers; hence, Iranians, who are mostly Muslim, consider Arabs as their brothers. This is a map of the Sasanian Empire which was the last empire before the spread of Islam:  I got it from:Sasanian Empire ",

I have many close Iranian friends and I appreciate Iran as it has pushed back Saudi and militant Sunni ambitions throughout the Arab world. That being said, i wish the government would be less stringent on its citizens and allow for more freedoms. It's not as crazy as Saudi Arabia but still very strict. I suppose, as an Egyptian, I can relate with Iranians because we both have a rich history that predates Islam. Unfortunately, Egypt and Iran have been at odds with one another more than they have been friendly. I feel very sorry for the average Iranian, who just wants to live as any other human being and take care of their family but is in severe financial distress due to harsh, unwarranted sanctions imposed by America and her dogs. Hopefully, I will visit this beautiful country some day. ",

Any conflict between Arabs and Iran is essentially because of oppressed government policy on key matters, and the outcome of the media machine and propaganda to influence public opinion. Some Arab governments have worked tirelessly to promote fear and hatred of Iran, especially the Saudis, and Egyptians. Others are neutral like Oman and Jordan, and some are friendly like parts of Lebanon and Syria. Saudi in particular are trying to position the conflict in a religious frame, while in reality it is purely political. The people in the other hand are either ignorant and believe the media and hate Iran, it are smart enough to have their own opinion.

Aside from politics/religion in regards to the social aspect Iranians are generally speaking very proud of their heritage and culture which is often viewed as arrogance and thus rubs Pan Arabs the wrong way often resulting in a tiresome competition. Among the Levant, Gulf and Maghrebi Arabs there is more unity due to shared language and similar culture. Wheras culturally and historically speaking, Iranians feel more close to the Tajiks/Afghans and Turks/Turkic people. But ofcourse we also love our Bandari (Iranian Arabs) people.
