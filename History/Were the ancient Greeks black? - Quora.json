            "answer_text": "Rita Maria Bargash's answer to Were the ancient Greeks black? No. There is no evidence of \u201cblack\u201d outside of sub saharan Africa. Meaning the indigenous people. Ancient Greek were mediterranean caucasoid, same as today with a variety of skin tones.  Truth hurts. It must be replaced with a lie. There is plenty of evidence of \u201cblack\u201d in the Sahara and in North Africa. The Nubians of Egypt and Sudan are among the blackest Africans. They are indigenous people and they are not sub-Saharan people. They are depicted on frescoes dating back to ancient Egypt.The Tebu of Libya and the Drawa of Morocco are North African indigenous Blacks. They are not sub-Saharan people.Saharan countries like Mali, Niger, Chad and Eritrea are inhabited by Blacks up to 90% let alone all the black skinned Sudanese and Mauritanians who are falsely categorized as North Africans.There are no countries in North Africa without indigenous black skinned populations. They mostly live in the southern regions, rural areas and as isolated communities in the north. Libya is at least 30% Black. Southern Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt are all black lands.The descendants of invading settlers from Eurasia themselves have kept oral traditions of the indigenous black skinned populations of North Africa they pushed south like the Bafour.

La tradition chze les Oulad Bieri [D'apr\u00e8s Ismail Ould Cheikh Sydia). Il y a bien longtemps, apr\u00e8s No\u00e9, ce sont les Noirs qui occupaient notre pays : ils remontaient jusqu'au Maroc, jusqu'au moment o\u00f9 vinrent de Syrie les premiers Blancs conqu\u00e9rants : c'\u00e9taient des hommes \u00e0 peau claire et dont les yeux \u00e9taient gris. Courtesy of Google Translate Long ago, after Noah, Blacks inhabited our country: they went up as far as Morocco until from Syria came the first white conquerors: they were light skinned men with grey eyes. La tradition chez les Ida Aghzeinbou Voici ce que l'on dit dans ma tribu : je le tiens de mon p\u00e8re qui le tient du sien. C'\u00e9taient les Noirs qui depuis No\u00e9 occupaient la Mauritanie jusqu'au Maroc. De grands Blancs vinrent de Syrie : leurs cheveux n'\u00e9taient pas noirs et leurs yeux \u00e9taient gris 2 ; ils eurent une guerre avec les Noirs et ils les repouss\u00e8rent, cela se passait bien longtemps avant le proph\u00e8te. Courtesy of Google Translate Here's what it is told in my tribe: I got it from my father who got it from his. Since Noah, Blacks inhabited Mauritania as far as Morocco. White men of great height came from Syria; their hair was black; and their eyes were gray. They waged a war with the Blacks and the Blacks were repulsed, this happened long before the prophet. The written word of the ancient times is crystal clear about what the ancient Berbers known as the Mauri, Mauretani or the Maurusoi looked like. Mauretania (Mauritania) Mauretania, or Maurusia, as it was called by Greek writers, unquestionably signified the land of the Mauri, a term still retained in the modern name of Moors, and probably meaning originally nothing but \"black men \". Internet History Sourcebooks Strabo: Geography, c. 22 A.D., XVII.iii.1-11 And I have heard this man say that beyond the country which he ruled there was no habitation of men, but desert land extending to a great distance, and that beyond that there are men, not black-skinned like the Mauretani. 6th A.D. \u2013 Procopius in his History of the Wars book IV contrasting the Germanic Vandals who had settled in North Africa with the Moors claimed the Vandals were not \u201cblack skinned like the Maurusioi\u201d. Better evidence is the results of archaeological studies. Archaeological studies On the remains of the Phoenicians and Carthaginians: \"The Phoenicians had nothing in common with the official Jewish type: brachycephal, aquiline or Hittite nose, and so on [...] skulls presumably Phoenician, have been found west of Syracuse [...] but these skulls are dolichocephalic and proganthous, with Negroid affinities\". \"Other bones discovered in Punic Carthage, and housed in the Lavigerie Museum, come from personages found in special sarcophagi and probably belonging to the Carthaginian elite. Almost all the skulls are dolichocephalic.\" - Eugene Pittard \"Les races et L' histoire.\" \"The anthropological examination of skeletons found in tombs in Carthage proves that there is no racial unity [...] The so called Semitic type, characterized by the long, perfectly oval face, the thin aquiline nose and the lengthened cranium, enlarged over the nape of the neck has not been found in Carthage. On the other hand, another cranial form, with a fairly short face, prominent parietal bumps, farther forward and lower down than is usual is common [...] most of the Punic population in Carthage had African and even Negro ancestors\" - Charles Picard \"Daily Life in Carthage at the time of Hannibal\". Adolph Bloch said, in a presentation to the French Anthropology Society in 1896, entitled \u201cSur des races noires indig\u00e8nes qui existaient anciennement dans l\u2019afrique septentrionale\u201d (On native black races which existed formerly in northern Africa): \"The race which gave birth to the Moroccans can be no other than the African negroes because the same black type [...] is found all the way to Senegal upon the right bank of the river without counting that it has been recognized in various parts of the Sahara [...] and from there comes black Moors who still have thick lips as a result of negro descent and not from intermixture [...] As to the white, bronze, or dark Moors, they are no other than the near relations of black Moors with whom they form the varieties of the same race; and as one can also see among the Europeans, blondes, brunettes, and chestnuts, in the midst of the same population so one may see Moroccans of every color in the same agglomeration without it being a question of their being real mulattos.\" The Mediterranean region is one of the oldest melting pots and the Mediterranean type is the result of amalgamation of light skinned and black skinned populations of various types who were once numerous in the region. Uniparental Markers of Contemporary Italian Population Reveals Details on Its Pre-Roman Heritage Mediterranean people have an average of 7.1% of black ancestry. Italians have a slightly higher black ancestry on average. \"This analysis indicated that Italians have a basal proportion of \"sub-Saharan\" ancestry that is higher (9.2%, on average) than other central or northern European populations (1.5%, on average). The amount of African ancestry in Italians is however more comparable to (but slightly higher than) the average in other Mediterranean countries (7.1%)\" ( Published: December 10, 2012DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0050794 ) ------- The accretion of a small amount of Negroid blood by the Mediterranean stock causes a frizziness of hair form; a darkening of skin color, which becomes extremely variable; a broadening of the nasal breadth; an increase in interorbital and biorbital dimensions; and often an increase in facial and nasal lengths, as well as a tendency to nasal profile convexity. Vault dimensions and body dimensions change little. - Carleton S Coon. Ph.D Mediterranean proper (hereafter meant when the word \"Mediterranean\" is used alone): Short-statured, dolicho- and mesocephalic form found in Spain, Portugal, the western Mediterranean islands, and to some extent in North Africa, southern Italy, and other Mediterranean borderlands. [...] often carries a slight negroid tendency. - Carleton S., Ph.D ------ The renowned French Ethnologist Dr. Paul Rivet, used to say: \u2018there is a ratio of 4 to 18 per cent black blood around the Mediterranean Sea\u2019. He thus referred to the Negroids of the early Paleolithic and Mesolithic - Grimaldi Man and Caspian Man -- an important group of the Mediterranean populations until the Neolithic ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I don't blame these people for not knowing the truth. Just take the words of most ancient Greek texts themselves stating that the first native settlers of ancient Greece were black bringing technologies including the invention of math itself from Egypt, which was the first major industrialized country. If you google \u201cthe first industrial country in the world\u201d you\u2019ll get Belguim, wikipedia with an asterisk noting the first \u201cEuropean\u201d industrialized country. A sly ploy at not having to mention the first industrialized country in the \u201cworld\u201d, which was Egypt. I say Greece but in reality Greece as a country or culture did not yet exist. For the last 500 years \u2014 after the death of King James of the Bible who was also a black man \u2014 the \u201cpowers that be\u201d have tried and in some cases succeeded at trying to rewrite history by cutting the larger noses off of statues and repainting paintings of people with african features with lighter skin and more European features. Even North Africans were considered White according to America up until the late 80\u2019s early 90\u2019s. The practice is called \u201cwhitenizing\u201d, which is what happened to a lot of King James\u2019 paintings. Just go to the Coronation of the current Queen of England and you\u2019ll see her testify to being of African ancestry. Our kids are a product of high school history books based in complete revisionist history written in the 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s, and early 70\u2019s. One of the most successful high school history text book of all time \u201cThe Triumph of the American Nation\u201d has perpetuated so many lies that it would be hard for anyone under 60 to believe the truth. Most all publisher have since required all current textbooks to read exactly as \u201cThe Triumph of the American Nation\u201d; for financial purposes of course. OMG, if someone actually took the time to study our real history the average Americans head would pop off! Seriously! Socrates the Greek philosopher describes himself as \u201cblack death from a kangaroo court brought on by drinking from a cup of poison hemlock as punishment for my teachings\u201d, the words of Socrates are the pillars of Christian belief and Western thought. Earning him the title Father of Western Philosophy. Note that all early greek philosophers went to Egypt for as long as 20 years to study philosophy. Even the word philosophy comes from Africa. There\u2019s no origin for the word philosophy in Greek. We know the truth if you dig deep enough, but the real question is why did they start trying to hide African origins in the 1500? Thats the real question! ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: NO. What does \u201cblack\u201d mean? First, lets get this idea of a color describing an ethnicity out of our heads. It\u2019s absurd. Skin color is not a very good way to designate genetic and ethnic heritage. For instance, many people from Sri Lanka have dark skin, yet we don\u2019t call them \u201cblack\u201d. There are many northern Indians with dark skin and we don\u2019t designate them as \u201cblack\u201d. In fact, the word \u201cCaucasian\u201d means, and originally meant, people of \u201cCaucasoid\u201d heritage. This included all Indo-Europeans, people from the Middle East, Near East, North Africa, Europe, West and Central Asia and the Indian Subcontinent. It had little to nothing to do with skin color and everything to do with other traits and heritage as Europeans, many North Africans, many west and central Asians all come from a similar source regardless of their skin tone. Today we use the word \u201cblack\u201d to describe people of sub-Saharan African descent, like we use the word \u201cwhite\u201d to describe people of European descent. The problem with this is the majority of sub-Saharan people are different shades of brown and yellow and the majority of Europeans are different shades of pink, olive, tan, and beige. Just like people from the middle east. Of course there is a big difference between a Swede and a southern Italian, yet both are considered \u201cwhite\u201d. Even though you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference between most southern Italians and Syrians, Lebanese or Palestinians. Conversely, we also think of the Levant as \u201cbrown\u201d, but that hardly would describe the range of phenotype found in the Levant, even outside of modern day Israel which is an aggregate of different Jews from around the globe, of all shades of skin tone. But you can find Lebanese people with dirty blond hair and blue eyes, you can find Persians with dirty blond hair and blue eyes, despite these not being the average phenotype of the area. All this means is that these areas are all populated by Eurasians and Eurasians come in various skin tones. Greece is no different. There are light skinned Greeks, some with blond hair and light eyes, there are olive skinned Greeks, beige Greeks some with blue eyes and dark hair, some with brown eyes and brown hair. Greeks, like all Eurasians, come in various different forms. You will find that there is a Mediterranean range of phenotype that basically covers any shore of the Mediterranean. That includes southern Europe, North Africa, and the Levant. We also should remember that when Alexander conquered much of the Mediterranean, the Near East and Central Asia, Greeks and other people that lived around Greece and the Black Sea migrated all across the Empire, including, heavily, to Egypt, where the Ptolemaic Dynasty was of Greek origin. After the Greeks came the Romans who expanded some areas and lost others. There was also the Persians, Assyrians, Babylonians and eventually Turks and Arabs conquering and/or migrating through these areas. So ALL of these areas are diverse and mixed. None have a single phenotype. Sub-Saharan Africans come in many tones too, most of which are not actually black. The oldest groups in Africa, the Khoi-San, are generally a yellow tone with Asian-like features. These are the oldest groups in Africa. It was from the proto-Khoi-San that all other populations on earth derived from. Human beings have generational mutations. Both skin lightening and skin darkening alleles developed fairly late in human evolution. Thus both very dark skin and very light skin are changes in human Phenotype. What we think of as \u201cAfrican\u201d phenotype today was heavily equatorial. The Bantu\u2019s from West Africa migrated east and enslaved, killed and pushed the Khoi-San and the Pygmy out of their territory. The Bantu and Bantu related people, who now settle much of sub-Saharan Africa only did so in the last couple of thousand years. Similarly, East Africa, especially the Horn Africa has very specific people groups and genetics. Horn Africans are in part sub-Saharan, Arabian and Northern Semitic because Horn Africa (Sudan and Ethiopia) were part of the ancient Mediterranean and Middle East world while West Africa, mostly, was not. Greeks however, were never what we now know as \u201cblack\u201d. People have watched this BBC show, which tried to reproduce the \u201cCheddar Man\u201d from England. Cheddar Man was a Western Hunter Gatherer, the people group that settled most of Western Europe after the last Ice Age. Many modern Europeans are direct descendants of these Western Hunter Gatherers, who mixed with incoming Middle East Farmers and then Indo-Europeans from the steppe. That episode was highly disingenuous. Western Hunter Gatherers did have slightly darker skin than most modern Brits, but it was probably a shade closer to Southern Europeans than sub-Saharan Africans. In fact, the scientists that were responsible for Cheddar Man got very upset with that depiction in the BBC episode and made a correction. You actually can\u2019t tell the skin tone from the genetic information they had. They could only tell that he did not have ONE of the three skin lightening alleles because it came later with the Indo-Europeans. That means he was probably a bit darker, perhaps like modern day southern Italians or Spaniards. But that doesn\u2019t mean he had anything to do with sub-Saharan Africans as the Western Hunter Gatherers were absorbed into the modern day European gene pool. Thus modern Europeans are far closer to the Western Hunter Gatherers than any person of modern sub-Saharan descent. Greeks were themselves a mixture of Western Hunter Gatherer, Eastern Hunter Gatherer (who were much lighter than their western counterparts) and Middle Eastern Farmers who migrated from Anatolia throughout the rest of Europe. Modern day Sardinians, Basques and North African Berbers are likely the closest to this original Middle East farmer population that migrated westward. While most other southern Europeans are various mixes. It is possible that upwards of 10,000 years ago, before any recorded history, there were some sub-Saharan Africans that migrated into Europe, but there is no record of them if so. Similarly, while \u201cblack\u201d Africans had lived in the region that is currently the Sahara desert from about 10,000 BCE to about 6000 BCE, during the Green Sahara, when the Sahara was not a desert but a lush, humid region. Desertification occurred, creating the Sahara we know today and these civilizations ended and mostly migrated south to what is now sub-Saharan Africa. Some migrated East towards the upper Nile in Sudan/Ethiopia. This migration cleared out most of the North African Green Sahara population. This is when Eurasians migrated from the Near East and Southern Europe and settled North Africa to create the Northern Egyptian\u2019s we know and the ancient proto-Berbers and many modern North African people groups. It was not until about 700 CE, when southern Arabians, whom we know as modern phenotype \u201cArabs\u201d, expanded, migrating and conquering out of the southern Arabian Peninsula. This is when North Africa, the Levant and much of the Middle East got its \u201cArab\u201d or \u201cbrown\u201d phenotype. North Africa and the Levant today have about 12% more sub-Saharan dna than in ancient times. This is specifically from this Arab expansion. Southern Arabs have always had a close trade and social connection to the Horn of Africa, as they are geographically very close. So when the Arabs set out from Southern Arabia, spreading Islam, they also spread the \u201cArab\u201d phenotype we think of today as having a heavy presence in North Africa and the Mid East. A phenotype that was far less abundant prior to Islam. People also seem to forget that \u201cwhite\u201d people have melanin and can tan, sometimes very dark. There are three different varieties of melanin in human beings. A brown pigment, a red pigment and a yellow pigment. All non albino humans have different proportions of these three varieties of melanin. While Northern Europeans will often have more of the red pigment, southern Europeans often have more of the brown and yellow pigment, which is why they can tan very dark quite often. While people with red hair tend to have an abundance of the red pigment, which is why they tend to freckle and burn more than tan. But that Northern European phenotype is a small minority in the broader Eurasian spectrum of phenotype. The vast majority of Eurasians, including Europeans, have a beige or olive complexion and tan. The further north you go, the more red and less brown pigment is found. But these are all considered \u201cwhite\u201d people today, which is a fairly silly term as it doesn\u2019t really describe anything accurately. ",

            "answer_text": "For the most part, the ancient Greeks looked just like modern Greeks. The majority of them had olive-colored skin, dark hair, and brown eyes. Obviously, though, due in part to Greece\u2019s geographic location in southeast Europe, there was a great degree of diversity in terms of physical appearance, just as there is in Greece today. Some people probably had darker skin and others had lighter skin. Certainly, some had blond hair and blue eyes, but most of them probably did not. Generally speaking, the ancient Greeks did not really pay much attention to skin color and there are not many references to it in ancient Greek texts. This is because the entire concept of \u201crace\u201d as we know it today is a relatively recent western cultural invention that did not exist prior to the eighteenth century. Ancient Greek writers such as Herodotos of Halikarnassos (lived c. 484 BC \u2013 c. 425 BC), who wrote about people of many different nations, had no concept of race. In fact, in ancient Greek and Roman art, skin color is most often used not to distinguish race, but rather to distinguish gender; men are commonly portrayed as darker-skinned and women are commonly portrayed as very pale-skinned, because respectable housewives were expected to remain indoors for almost their entire lives and rarely, if ever, go outside. For instance, here is a first-century AD Roman fresco from Pompeii showing the Greek deities Aphrodite and Ares:  Aphrodite is shown as pale because she is female and Ares is shown as deeply tanned because he is male. Here is a Greek mosaic from Antioch dating to the second century AD, showing the Judgment of Paris:  The goddesses Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite are all shown as pale-skinned because they are female, but Paris is shown as darker-skinned because he is male.

            "answer_text": "No. But let\u2019s anyse it since we\u2019re here. First of all, what do you mean by \u201cblack\u201d? If you mean the social construct as it is percieved sometimes primarily in USA, the menial worker with low income that is abused by society\u2026then\u2026  Well not even by that definition. They had a lot of slaves and some of the slaves were Greek but the Greek citizens were ruling thmeselves either in direct democracies or in oligarchic republics. They all had some land/house and if they hadn\u2019t they were sent to get some in a colony or they became mercenaries which paid a lot thus either way they were or became higher income citizens. Therefore not black. But I guess you ask if they had a very dark skin. But this is also a social construct. How \u201cblack\u201d is black? If you have a drop of blood of a \u201cblack\u201d ancestor, are you black? By American standards you are, even if it\u2019s just 1/32 which is silly: by some laws in the United States, people with one black ancestor of 32 might be called \"black,\" but their 31 other ancestors are also important in influencing their health.[1] Anyway, regardless of the vagueness, the false assumptions and misconceptions of your question, let\u2019s see if the original Greeks are black. I have a lot of refernces and clues in an answer to a related question: Yannis Gaitanas's answer to Do Greeks honor their black African ancestors which is scientifically shown by haplogroup analysis? But again we are having an issue as to who where the original Greeks? If we define them as \u201cthe first humans(Homo sapiens) that lived in Greece\u201d then we sould have in mind that Greece also had a Homo sapiens neanderthalensis population.  And Neaderthals are pretty much the original blonde or red haired humans, the ones with rosy cheeks, fair skin, freckles etc. And these guys were in Greece 40, 000 years ago. That\u2019s pretty much original. Neanderthal third molar from the site of Lakonis, Greece, dating to ca. 40,000 years ago.[2] But were these paleolithic people Greeks? Given that Greece has the earliest Homo sapiens sapiens remains in Europe, perhaps the first homo sapiens ever appeared in Greece, thus the E haplogroup that is more common in Greeks and nearby Albanians may have come from these first African settlers some hundred thousand years ago. However, as I have explained at the answer I linked above, it\u2019s not just the Greeks that have this haplogroup-it\u2019s kinda common throught Europe and west Asia.  How can you assume 20% of an E haplogroup means your ancestors were black while 10% means they weren\u2019t? Where\u2019s the limit, and why? Again, it seems it\u2019s an arbitary social construct. Besides, the biggest percentage is found in Albania and Italy and even more among the Sephardi Jews. If you mix thme with Greeks you get colours such as  Gabriele Carteris-a Grecojewish actress. I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s black and nor should you. If we are still talking about paleolithic humans, apart from the Neaderthals, most Cro Magnon would be rather black. There is some debate over Cheddar man but most scientists believe he was a black Englishman from 10,000 years ago:  Tom Booth, an archaeologist at the Natural History Museum who worked on the project, said: \u201cIt really shows up that these imaginary racial categories that we have are really very modern constructions, or very recent constructions, that really are not applicable to the past at all.\u201d Yoan Diekmann, a computational biologist at University College London and another member of the project\u2019s team, agreed, saying the connection often drawn between Britishness and whiteness was \u201cnot an immutable truth. It has always changed and will change\u201d. (...) Scientists believe that populations living in Europe became lighter-skinned over time because pale skin absorbs more sunlight, which is required to produce enough vitamin D. The latest findings suggest pale skin may have emerged later, possibly when the advent of farming meant people were obtaining less vitamin D though dietary sources like oily fish.[3] So, there is not much point arguing about the color of paleolithic populations. Besides, these doesn\u2019t count as \u201cGreeks\u201d, right? The first people that we can undisputably call Greeks were the ones that we have written proof that they spoke Greek, the Myceneans. Together with the related Minoans that inhabited the islands they were the people that lived in the Helladic area after the neolithic age, during the Bronze age. Minoans and Mycenaeans were genetically similar, having at least three-quarters of their ancestry from the first Neolithic farmers of western Anatolia and the Aegean and most of the remainder from ancient populations related to those of the Caucasus and Iran. However, the Mycenaeans differed from Minoans in deriving additional ancestry from an ultimate source related to the hunter\u2013gatherers of eastern Europe and Siberia introduced via a proximal source related to the inhabitants of either the Eurasian steppe or Armenia. Modern Greeks resemble the Mycenaeans, but with some additional dilution of the Early Neolithic ancestry. [4]  So, that settles it. These people got the pale colored genes from the paleolithic Neaderthals or the Helladic region but mostly came from the Aegean and Western Anatolia with some remainder from Caucasus/Iran. The ancient Greek speaking Myceneans in particular, had an additional ancestry from Eastern Europe and Siberia. That\u2019s pretty far away from \u201cblack\u201d Africa. Besides, we can see from art that not only do ancient Greeks made images of them as white people but we also have examples of blonde hair too:  Blond Kouros's Head of the Acropolis . The original blond painting of the curly hair is faded. Only remnants of the paint are visible today. Pictured below is a photograph of the so called Blond Kouros's Head of the Acropolis. The head is a gypsum copy of the original in Athens. It is painted with the colors believed to have been originally used by the artist, however, only traces of the blond hair have been actually found. The painting was done by experts in the Antikensammlung M\u00fcnchen, Germany. Frontal view.  [5] So, were they black? No, however you see it.

The percentage of black hair in Ancient Greece would be at 65% in the southern mainland and 72% in Cyprus. And I hate Nordic supremacists who claim all Ancient Greeks were Germanic looking blondes before the Turkish invasion. The Turkish invasion genetically had little impact on Mainland Greece and just slightly more on Cyprus. Though the Greeks had more Eastern influences than western ones. Hence why the Greeks are an Ancient society mentioned in the Bible whereas the Ancient Spaniards weren\u2019t mentioned in the Bible. If you grab some Greek food in Toronto it will have way more influences from the Middle East than a Fish and Chips restaurant out predominantly English/Scottish Barrie Ontario which is bland European food. It sickens me that bullshit white nationalist sites and groups have been trying to recruit Greeks in the diaspora over the past 40 years in countries such as Canada and the U.S. to join their groups. Just 100 years ago in Toronto there were anti Greek riots and in America the KKK actively targeted Greek immigrants in Omaha in 1909. As such the American Hellenic Society was formed. I really think Greeks should pride themselves in their own lovely culture and heritage as opposed to trying to be like bland Anglos living in cookie cutter suburban homes. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. I even think the opposite Why? because Greeks are Mediterranean people and the Mediterranean isn't native to Black people historically. Blacking of the Mediterranean people started with the slave trade with Subsaharan Africa especially with the Horn of Africa and Nubia (Today\u2019s Sudan). And mostly affected Egypt due to close proximity. Therefore Egypt is one of the darkest country when it comes to skin color. What a coincide. :) So can we call Greeks of Mediterraneans white? Yes and No. Why again? Because people who inhabited the Mediterranean developed unique skin color it's kinda changing from session to season. It\u2019s called olive skin. When you exposed to a lot of sunlight you had to adapt. Olive skin Mediterranean people tend to look like a Latino when they are in their respective native land. But If you took the Mediterranean who has olive skin in this case let's say ancient greek to the northern latitudes after a couple of mounts s/he became significantly lighter. How do I know that? Because I\u2019m a Mediterranean person. So Probably an average ancient Greek doesn\u2019t look like a Scandinavian white like when they exposed to the sun they immediately turn in to pink white. They like to be white but easily can be tanned white and easily de-tannable when they lack sun white. ",

By and large Greeks are \u201cMediterranean\u201d type with dark, often loosely curling hair, dark eyes and olive skin (I\u2019m a bit paler unless I work on a tan, but I have the eyes and hair!). Of course there are Greeks who range from simple \u201cbrown hair\u201d to blond and even blue eyes, but there are rather rare compared to the very common Mediterranean features. ",

It was a big deal however for the colonials who needed cover for enslaving people and stealing their properties and resources. The whole Thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal, etc thing was a bit of problem and the solution was that white people were superior and other colors were not really 100% human. So taking something from an animal is not really stealing and killing an animal is not a sin. So thats why the whole racial supremacy thing came about\u2026 ",

Although black he wasn\u2019t Political Correct like the Athenean Warrior. He used to have many slaves and he was actually proud of it. As a matter of fact at least once every year he was going hunting after Argeans in order to enslave them and make them break their backs at his plantation.

If you mean dark-skinned, then yes their pre-historic ancestors were because all humans were dark skinned if you go back far enough. If you mean black as in what we call modern sub-Saharan Africans, then no. Ancient \u201cCheddar man\u201d shows that pre-historic people in Britain were dark-skinned. But you wouldn\u2019t call him black by the modern definition. He had blue eyes and only slightly curly hair. Other than the darker skin, he shared no typical characteristics with today\u2019s \u201cblack people\u201d. The first people that we call \u201cGreek\u201d were not dark-skinned. Their distant ancestors were though, just like everyone else. But even by the time the Greek predecessors, the Mycenaeans, emerged, it was thousands of years after evolution had significantly lightened the skin tone of European peoples (and North Africans and West and Far East Asians).

We know that modern Greeks are not black. So, it is right to conclude that the ancient Greeks were not blacks. The photo above is the bust of Plato. It is the Roman copy of the Greek original bust.

In some parts of Europe Black people lived even in bronze age. In Greek case, Near East people and people from central Asia migrated there and developed Greek civilization as we know it now. During classical period there were black people not as citizen but slaves. So in modern sense, Greeks shares black genes and it has been proved scientifically. Sources: 1) New study suggests white skin came to Europe from Near East 2)Neolithic and Bronze Age migration to Ireland and establishment of the insular Atlantic genome 3)https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/afrg/hd_afrg.htm 4)Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans 5.

Further the out of Africa does not mean that humanity came from people similar to modern day \u201cAfricans\u201d and therefor humanity should have started \u201cblack\u201d There is no evidence for this either. None of modern day human \u201craces\u201d was involved in the out of Africa. Ancient Greek were mediterranean caucasoid, same as today with a variety of skin tones. This however doesnt mean or equal being of a mixed \u201crace\u201d or that not looking \u201cwhite\u201d/nordic equals \u201cblack\u201d. The variety of skin tone/shade among the mediterranean populations is mostly due to environmental weather/climate conditions rather than \u201cadmixture\u201d There is no genetic evidence for this either.

The gene responsible for lighter skin colouring is about 13,000 years old. There was a dark age following the collapse of the Mycenian civilisation. The gene had spread to what is now Greece by the end of that dark age. So, by the time we can start talking about \u201cClassical Greek civilisation\u201d, the people involved had a much lighter skin tone the current residents of sub-Saharan Africa. But the people who lived in what is now Greece prior to that almost certainly had much darker skin than the current residents. ",
