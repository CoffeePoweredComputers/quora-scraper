            "answer_text": "It is OBLIGATORY upon the Muslim to follow the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), according to the way of the righteous salaf who followed the GUIDANCE of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the SAHAABAH and those who followed them \u2013 may Allaah be pleased with them all. These people are called AHL AL-SUNNAH WA\u2019L-JAMAA\u2019AH (the People of the Sunnah and the Community). Everyone who follows the way BROUGHT by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is one of THEM\u2026 what do you say to those who do not acknowledge (for whatever reason) the scholars of today such as shaikh Uthaymeen, shaykh bin Baaz raheemahullah, shaykh Al-Albaani raheemahullah? a few call them wahabi and say that these scholars follow a new sect rather than the universal deen of al-Islam that was followed by all the major scholars of the past. Answer Praise be to Allaah. The Muslim is obliged to accept the teachings of Islam, and act upon them. When he hears of some word or deed which is based on EVIDENCE (daleel) from the Qur\u2019aan or Sunnah, then he has to accept it and give it PRIORITY over anything else. He should check what people say against the evidence of sharee\u2019ah, and only accept those views which are in accordance with that evidence. It is known that Shaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd Al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him) called people to TAWHEED and he wrote his famous book on that topic which is CALLED Kitaab al-Tawheed. In this book he limited himself to quoting only the CLEAR evidence from the verses of the Qur\u2019aan and the SAHEEH ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Commentaries on this book were written by his grandson \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan and other scholars. Hence none of his opponents can REFUTE this book or claim that his evidence is FALSE. They fabricated LIES and believed them, so they believed that he was misguided. They gave the same label to the scholars of the Muslims such as Shaykh Ibn Baaz and Shaykh AL-ALBAANI (may Allaah have mercy on them both). It is known that the shaykhs whom we have mentioned did NOT deviate from the correct view with regard to BELIEFS and ACTIONS; they followed the same path as the SAHAABAH and TAABI\u2019EEN, the FOUR imaams, the AUTHORS of the Six Books and others. Those who do NOT acknowledge them do that either out of IGNORANCE, BLIND IMITATION of others, JEALOUSY, STUBBORNNESS or following their own WHIMS and DESIRES, or adherence to traditions, BID\u2019AH (innovation) and EVIL actions that go AGAINST the evidence (of SHAREE\u2019AH). Earlier and later scholars have proven such people to be wrong. So we must FOLLOW the evidence and give it PRIORITY over the views of all people\u2026 Have a wonderful day\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "He was an initiated Sufi of the Qadiri order, among others. The Qadiri Sufi order traces back to Shaykh Abdal Qadir Jilani, who followed the Hanbali fiqh. In a manuscript of the Hanbali 'alim, Shaikh Yusuf bin 'Abd al-Hadi (d. 909H), entitled Bad' al-'ula bi labs al-Khirqa [found in Princeton, Sorbonne and Damascus], Ibn Taymiyya is found in a Sufi spiritual genealogy with other well-known Hanbali scholars, all except one (Say. Jilani) heretofore unknown as Sufis. The links in this genealogy are, in descending order: (Both Abu 'Umar b. Qudama and his brother Muwaffaq received the khirqa directly from Abdul Qadir Jilani himself.) Further corroboration of two links separating him from 'Abdul Qadir Jilani comes from Ibn Taymiyya himself, as quoted in a manuscript of the work al-Mas'ala at-Tabriziyya (manuscript, Damascus, 1186 H): Ibn Taymiyya is quoted by Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Hadi, affirming his Sufi affiliation in more than one Sufi order: [found in \"Al-Hadi\" manuscript in Princeton Library, Collection fol. 154a, 169b, 171b-172a and Damascus University, copy of original Arabic manuscript, 985H.; also mentioned in \"at-Talyani\", manuscript Chester Beatty 3296 (8) in Dublin, fol. 67a.] Additional evidence of Ibn Taymiyya's connection to the Qadiri silsila (lineage) is found in his lengthy commentary on the seminal Sufi work by his grand-shaikh, 'Abdul Qadir Jilani, entitled \"Futuh al-Ghayb.\" [this is found in a Princeton manuscript, uncataloged, also in Leipzig University Library, Arabic manuscript #223, and Istanbul University, Turkish translation, \"Futuh ul-Gayb Hakkinda Yorum\"] The essence of his commentary on \"Futuh al-Ghaib\" is to show that Sufism, when orthodox, is completely in consonance with the Qur'an and hadith and the consensus of the community [ijma'a]. A Tasawwuf not based on the revealed law is heretical. In his commentary, Ibn Taymiyya upholds ilham, or Sufi inspiration, as evidence stronger than weak analogy [qiyas], or a weak tradition [hadith,] or istis-hab cited by those who are immersed in fiqh, or divergences of the law [khilaf], or the principles and sources of the law [usul al-fiqh]. He places inspiration [ilham] on the level of legally valid evidence on which to base a preference for one action as against another when all other sources fail. Perfection of the soul, says Ibn Taymiyya, does not consist in mere knowledge. On the contraray, along with the knowledge concerning Allah, there must necessarily be love [mahabba] of Allah, worship of Allah, and the turning back to Him in repentance. Real tawhid consists in worshipping no one but Allah, and worship calls for perfect love [kamal al-hubb], perfect veneration [kamal at-ta'zim], perfect hope, fear, reverence, and respect [kamal ar-raja' wal-khishya wal-ijlal wal-ikram]. We intend to publish a translation of that lengthy commentary by Ibn Taymiyya on Futuh al-Ghaib in the future. Ibn Taymiyya's Discussion of Tasawwuf in His Majmu'a Fatawa What Ibn Taymiyya Says About the Term `Tasawwuf' Here we will mention what Imam Ibn Taymiyya, mentioned about the definition of Tasawwuf, from Volume 11,\"At-Tawassuf\" of \"Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya al-Kubra,\" Dar ar-Rahmah, Cairo, Imam Ibn Taymiyya says: Ibn Taymiyya continues: He continues about the Sufis, Imam Ibn Taymiyya About Saints and Sainthood Imam Ibn Taymiyya mentions in volume 11, page 190 of Majmu'a Fatawi Shaikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyya, edition published in Egypt by Dar ar-Rahma: He then quotes the famous hadith from Bukhari: Imam Ibn Taymiyya About Miracles of Saints In his book al-Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya, published by al-Madani Publishing House, 1980, page 603: He continues in Majmu'a Fatawi Ibn Taymiyya: All that Imam Ibn Taymiyya says about the subject of Tasawwuf is found in a large book (volume 11) consisting of 704 pages only about Tasawwuf. And we would like to mention briefly what he said on page 314, about the hadith Qudsi [i.e. related from Allah Himself]: Imam Ibn Taymiyya says: He continues on p. 314 quoting Prophet's saying about the saints: Imam Ibn Taymiyya About the Unveiling of Appearances He said: Imam Ibn Taymiyya Mentions some Great Shaikhs of Sufism And we wish to mention some of the shaikhs which Imam Ibn Taymiyya accepted from the well-known Sufi shaikhs. This is found in his volume entitled 'Ilm as-Sulook [the Science of Travelling the Way to God], which consists of the whole of volume 10 of Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya which is 775 pages in length, all of which is about the knowledge of the ways of true Sufism, the Science of Travelling to God, ['ilm us-sulook]. On page 516, the third paragraph he says: And Ibn Taymiyya continues: In Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya, published by Dar ar-Rahmat, Cairo, Vol, 11, page 497. Book of Tassuwuf), Ibn Taymiyya says: Here we find Ibn Taymiyya calling for people to take a guide and mentioning that each guide has his own method (tariqat) in calling people to the Prophet's ways.
