            "answer_text": "As Andrey Shevchenko already said, for most Ukrainians the word \"makhnovshchina\" is the only thing they associate with Makhno. From my observations, his image is perceived somewhat humoristically - perhaps due to years of Soviet (anti)propaganda which depicted his anarchist formation as a complete mess .  It is a pity because his movement was not as primitive as may appear at first glance. I doubt it can be really considered as a part of Ukrainian national movement proper, but nevertheless he was quite an influential player in his time. ",
