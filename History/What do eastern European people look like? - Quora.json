Here are some examples: Russian singer Elena Sergeevna Katina  Russian actor Andrei Chadov  Bulgarian singer Emilia Valeva  Bulgarian singer Krum  Romanian ex-model/TV moderator Andreea Raicu  Member of the Romanian group \u201cAkcent\u201d Adrian Sina  Serbian ex-model and TV hostess Nina Radulovi\u0107 Le\u010di\u0107  Serbian actor Milo\u0161 Bikovi\u0107  Polish actress Joanna Kulig  Polish singer Micha\u0142 Kwiatkowski  Hungarian singer Laura Cserpes  As you can see, we can be both very different from each other and yet very similar in some parts.

Small and very tall people (that is a north - south thing as everywhere). I cannot even say that all Eastern Europeans are white because Roma who have been living here for more than thousand years have often a darker skin color and so do people from the Balkans. Yes, there is a certain stereotypically eastern slavic look: High cheek bones, very pale but rosy cheeks. But you won\u2018t find this much in the Western and Southern Slavic countries, where people mixed with Germanic, Celtic, Magyars, Roman, Greek, Jewish and Ottoman people for a really long time. ",
