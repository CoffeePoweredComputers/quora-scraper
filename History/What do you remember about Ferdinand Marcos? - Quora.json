            "answer_text": "I was just a kid during the latter days of Ferdinand Marcos. Aside from what is already written in the books (both negative and positive),few things I can remember him by: Nutribun - while it is largely a product of the US Food for Peace Program, it was popularized by the Marcoses high-jacking it by stamping their names on the bag of buns and distribute it to public schools. Compared to pandesal, it is larger, harder and dense. It is filling but not palatable for some of us kids and what the school teachers do is they will offer you a spread of margarine or peanut butter for 5 cents. Ah, those were the days.Bagong Lipunan bank note series and jingle - The fancy design of the Philippine peso and the legendary, rat in the 2 peso bill. Oh yeah, and that Bagong Lipunan jingle that always plays on the radio and sung during flag ceremonies after Panatang Makabayan. Heck, it plays in my head sometimes.Green Revolution - A project that saw the rise of abundant rice production and self-sustenance. Ironically, this was also the time that poverty shot up despite the affordable price of rice. Information here .Negros famine - I remember Ka Freddie Aguilar\u2019s song \u201cMga Bata sa Negros\u201d and the pictures of gaunt, hungry children along with it. I remember it was due to the fall of the region\u2019s sugar industry.Ninoy Aquino\u2019s assasination - This was the biggest news in the country and even the world back in mid 80\u2019s. It even spawned a movie revolving around the supposed assassin, Rolando Galman.Philippine Constabulary (PC-INP) - for a time, they were the local boogeymen of children when parents wants them to stay indoors. I remember them saying \u201cHala, kukunin ka ng pulis!\u201d to younger kids or \u201cAyan may PC!\u201d for teens. I think this was an allusion to the news about disappearing militant students in which the PC was allegedly involved.Banning Mecha/Anime like Voltes V - WTF, right? We kids had to settle with Sesame Street, campy Hanna-Barbera cartoons and He-Man.These are some of the things I remember back then. At that time, government propaganda filled the radio and TV but also sentiments against the government was at its peak. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A I don\u2019t remember anything about Ferdinand Marcos except that he was booted out as President of the Philippines. But I definitely remember his wife, Imelda. She was reported to have owned 7500 pairs of shoes. It was a standing joke among late-night comedians. Believe it or not, she\u2019s still alive. Age 89. When I heard about the former Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak, and his wife I immediately thought about Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. Here\u2019s a brief list of what was confiscated from the Razaks: \u201cThe items comprised 12,000 pieces of jewelry, 567 handbags, 423 watches and 234 sunglasses, said commercial crime investigations chief Amar Singh. The jewelry includes 2,200 rings, 1,400 necklaces, 2,100 bracelets, 2,800 pair of earrings, 1,600 brooches and 14 tiaras, he said.\u201d1MDB Probe: $273 Million in Valuables Seized From Ex-PM I\u2019m fascinated by why a person would need 14 tiaras. Did she sleep in them? Same with the 7500 pairs of shoes owned by Imelda. There are only 365 days in a year. It would have taken her over twenty years to wear them all if she wore a different pair every day. Talk about hoarders! ",
