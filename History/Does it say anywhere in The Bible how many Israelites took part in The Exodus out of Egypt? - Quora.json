            "answer_text": "About 600,000 adult men not counting women and children with them as well as another \"mixed multitude\" mentioned right after that and also a great many life stock (Exodus 12:37). So...I'm guessing a few million, AT LEAST. It could have very will be 10 million or more for all we know considering that extra \"multitude\" mentioned with them. That \"mixed multitude\" is actually another important point for archaeological evidence, since many scholars of the Exodus studying ancient Palestine would point out our evidence for early Israel with all their settlements, artifacts, pottery, etc, in the earliest centuries seemed to also have a mix of peoples rather than a single ethnicity. But what is ethnicity? I agree with the scholars now who don't take either a hyper objective or subjective stance towards defining ethnicity and contend historical traditions and continuity, rather than anything biological or physical, is what defines an ethnicity in antiquity. It's why what unites \"Americans\" as a single group is our acceptance of certain historical traditions, regardless how much we disagree on them. But that's obviously a tangent for another debate. And that debate is over the meaning of the Merneptah Stele which claims an \"Israel\" existed in Palestine right around 1200 B.C. And I point that out to just refute Rod's answer which is completely unsupported. Rather than \"Google it\" I will cite the real scholars who point out such \"13th century BCE\" evidence for \"Israel as a place and name...\" [EXCERPT] \u201c \u2018Canaan has been plundered into every sort of woe; Ashkelon has been overcome; Gezer has been captured. Yanoam was made nonexistent; Israel is laid waste, his seed is not.\u2019Now there are a couple of things I want to say about this mention of Israel. This is not just a mention in a deed or a contract that may have reference to a small village or even less. This reference to Israel shows that the post powerful man in the world, the pharaoh of Egypt, was aware of Israel. Not only was he aware of Israel\u2014he boasts that one of the most important achievements of his reign was to defeat Israel. Of course he exaggerates when he says that Israel\u2019s seed is not\u2026.The fact is that in 1212 B.C.E. (the campaign was five years before the inscription), Israel must already have been a military force to be reckoned with....The Merneptah Stele is obviously a very important piece of evidence in connection with the current debate about the rise of Israel\u2026If Israel was already such a force in Canaan in 1212 B.C.E., then Israel must have been established there for some time. Those who would like to push back the date for Israel\u2019s entry into Canaan, stress this aspect of the Merneptah Stele\u2026On the other hand, those who say that Israel\u2019s existence only begins with the monarchy have to deal with this troubling bit of evidence. I often wonder what would happen if we didn\u2019t have this fortuitously preserved find. I\u2019m almost certain that those scholars who insist that Israel didn\u2019t exist before the monarchy and who tell us that there is no premonarchical history accounts in the Bible would carry the day\u2026.How do these scholars deal with the Merneptah Stele, since it indubitably does exist. They say that Israel refers to something else. What that something else is, is not clear.\u201d(Shank, 47, 49-50)Reference:\u201cDefining the Problems: Where We Are in the Debate,\u201d The Rise of Ancient Israel, ed. Hershel Shank, William G. Dever, Baruch Halpern and P. Kyle McCarter, Jr. (Washington, DC: Biblical Archaeology Society, 2012), 7-61, iBooks. [EXCERPT] Also, it is never mentioned that this amount was also how many Israelites were \"slaves\" to the Egyptians. Recall again the \"mixed multitude\" that is separated from the 600,000 men. However, if we expect Egypt to have used mostly men, as is most likely, in their manual labor projects for constructing cities and temples, then 600,000 is not actually that exaggerative. Going by the traditional dating of the Exodus around the mid 15th century B.C., not only does archaeology reveal a plethora of Semitic and Asiatic slaves for the Egyptians' projects, but the pharaoh Amenhotep II (the one I think was the Pharaoh of the Exodus too; the chronology would make it either him or his father Thutmose III which I very much doubt due to the fact he remained literally one of the greatest pharaohs of Egypt ever and led numerous military campaigns all his life until his death) in one of only 2 military campaigns he executed at the beginning of his reign captured over 100,000 POWs likely to be used as slaves (see Petrovich, Doug. \u201cAmenhotep II and the Historicity of the Exodus Pharaoh.\u201d Associates for Biblical Research (February 4, 2010). http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2010/02/04/Amenhotep-II-and-the-Historicity-of-the-Exodus-Pharaoh.aspx (accessed 6 November 2016).) I know this is still much less than 600,000, but 100,000 captives in a campaign is literally unheard of in all of Egtypt's history in this time. It's not much to suggest this was undertaken to replace the mass exodus of Hebrew slaves by Amenhotep (or perhaps his replacement as one scholar I've read theorized he actually died in the events of the Exodus and the Egyptians quietly replaced him with another; he argued this based off the evidence we have in Egyptian records for two different ascension years for Amenhotep II and the fact we have no evidence to think Amenhotep was a coregent). And lastly, I just want to point out nomadic tribes and, yes, even entire nations rarely left archaeological remains. Interestingly, most of Israel's early rivals and nomadic neighbors mentioned in the Bible like Edom and Moab also do not appear in the archaeological record until roughly the same time as Merneptah's inscription in the 13th century B.C. However, while there is a significant amount of WRITTEN evidence to their existence in such centuries, there is next to no archaeological remains for ANY of them. And to point out one example, we had literally NO archaeological evidence for the entire nomadic nation of Scythia for quite some time, despite ample written testimonial evidence in history to their existence. Point is, no before you or anyone else asks, we should not expect a large amount or perhaps even ANY amount of archaeological remains to be discovered proving such a huge multitude was traveling nomadically for 40 years before settling down and hardly in an organized, national sense (that did not come until much later for biblical Israel) but in a tent-based, tribal system of settlements. FORTUNATELY...archaeology has uncovered precisely that in the time and place of Palestine the Bible informs us Israel had begun settling down. ",
