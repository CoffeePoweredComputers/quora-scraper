            "answer_text": "We really still don\u2019t exactly know, from What are the routes of transmission of leprosy? The route of transmission has not been definitively established, although human-to-human aerosol spread of nasal secretions is thought to be the most likely mode of transmission in most cases. Leprosy is not spread by touch, since the mycobacteria are incapable of crossing intact skin. Living near people with leprosy is associated with increased transmission. According to Transmission of leprosy: a study of skin and nasal secretions of household contacts of leprosy patients using PCR - PubMed Results showed that 60% of untreated MB leprosy patients examined histologically had acid-fast bacilli in the keratin layer. By PCR studies it was found that 80% of the patients had M. leprae DNA in skin washings and 60% had M. leprae DNA on swabs obtained from the nasal mucosa. Ninety-three contacts of the untreated MB cases were also tested for exposure to M. leprae by analyzing skin washings and nasal secretions by PCR. PCR analysis showed significant skin (17% positive) and nasal muscosal (4%) exposure in contacts before instituting treatment of the index cases. After 2 months of treating the index cases, all contacts tested were negative for M. leprae DNA. These data suggested that both skin and nasal epithelia of untreated MB leprosy patients contribute to the shedding of M. leprae into the environment and contacts of untreated MB cases are at risk for contact with M. leprae through both the nasal mucosa and exposed surfaces of their skin. Living in close contact with a patient, and acquiring the Mycobacteria leprae from their skin and aerosols from their noses can induce infections in the people around them. ",

            "answer_text": "Why did the armadillo cross the road?  To give leprosy on the other side.   The most common way in the US  one can contract leprosy is from an infected armadillo.  Leprosy is not very contagious.  You can contract it with close contact with an infected individual.  Because this infection is rare and presents with symptoms that are slow growing, the actual way it is transmitted is unknown.  Most epidemiologists believe the infection starts in the respiratory tract.  The vast majority of cases in the United States are from immigrants from third world countries. If you develop an injury or a skin condition that tingles or even stops hurting after a period of time but does not heal, it very well might be leprosy.  Leprosy attacks the nervous system. ",

            "answer_text": "Leprosy is a type of mycobacterium, a group of very slow growing bacteria.  There is usually a lot of contact involved, but it isn't be a rigid rule.  Mostly it is shed in the nose or lungs, but there are mycobacterium in the skin, so a wound is probably also a possibility. The bacterium can cross over mucus membranes (so mouth, nose) or through the skin (it cannot go through intact skin, but any little wound will do.)  I am guessing the people who contract it from armadillos are hunters/preparers of armadillos - in that case it might involve a really large exposure all at once, rather than the repeated small exposures that lets it pass from human to human.  I don't think any other sources are known. ",

            "answer_text": "Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, an acid-fast, rod-shaped bacillus. The disease mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes. Although not highly infectious, leprosy is transmitted via droplets, from the nose and mouth, during close and frequent contacts with untreated cases. Contrary to the social stigma, leprosy is not highly contagious, and does not cause body parts to fall off. In fact, 95% of the world's population is naturally immune to the disease and, once diagnosed, a person is easily cured. Transmission from human to human is through respiratory droplets. Hope this simple answer would enlighten your day and have a nice day. ",

More importantly, the interaction of the human immune system with the leprosy bacteria determines whether a person can catch leprosy at all and how the disease manifests itself in the people who do catch it. Those characteristics of the immune system are hereditary. So a person can inherit susceptibility or resistance to leprosy and can inherit a tendency to develop one or the other clinical forms of leprosy. ",
