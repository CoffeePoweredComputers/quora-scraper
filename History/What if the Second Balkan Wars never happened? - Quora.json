            "answer_text": "So, your question takes us to parallel universe, in which Bulgaria does not attack Greece and Serbia in 1913. The Balkan alliance (Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria and Montenegro) remains intact and strong. Bulgaria would own a shore of the Aegean sea along with the port city of Kavala, much of what is now European Turkey. Assuming the assassination of the Austrian Archduke still happened in 1914 in Serbia and Austrian empire declared war on Serbia, the Balkan alliance would be reactivated against the Austrian empire. The Ottoman empire would be too weakened and geographically isolated to ally with the central empires (Germany and Austria), because in our timeline Bulgaria joined them and provided a bridge among them and the ottoman empire. The first world war would be much shorter. Maybe it would end by 1916. Possibly by a treaty less humiliating for Germany. Thus WWII would be avoided as the reason for the rise of nasism (poverty and humiliation) could be null. The Balkan alliance could evolve into a \u201cChristian confederation\u201d or not. Turkey would still be around, minus a big part of the European side, confined to the outskirts of Istanbul/Constantinople. Albania would be somehow smaller, as the cities of Kor\u00e7e/Korytsa, Gyrocaster/Argyrocastro and Avlonas might have been Greek (they were occupied by the Greek army in 1913). The European campaign in South Russia (1919) would not have a Greek contingent, so no Greco-Turkish war (1919\u20131922), no exchange of population, no genocide of Greeks (Rums) in Turkey. So the Greco-Turkish relations would be quite cordial today, no Turkish campaign in Cyprus (1973\u20131974). How about that? A peaceful middle East without religious fundamentalism. One can only dream. ",

            "answer_text": "The 2nd Balkan War (29 June \u2013 10 August 1913) was caused by Bulgaria, which was dissatisfied with the territorial gains it got from the first Balkan war. For more territory, they attacked all of their former allies, Serbia, Greece, etc. and ended up with a huge loss, and a big blow to their economy as well. Worst of all, they would join the Central Powers in WW1 later on and blow their existing economy and territories as well. For your question: If Bulgaria never caused the 2nd Balkan war, we would have seen a very different Geopolitical map of the Balkans: A smaller kingdom of Serbia, Smaller Greece, smaller Romania, a little smaller European side of Turkey, and obviously a bigger Bulgaria. WW1 would have inevitably happened, making the Bulgarians have a much greater chance of winning the war (just in the Balkans) with some key territories and a better economy. However, the Central Powers were doomed from the start, so it wouldn\u2019t have been long before the British or French were at their doorstep. In total, we would have just seen a stronger Bulgaria, but still losing the territories and economy they actually did after the 1st Balkan War. Hope this helped! : ) ",
