            "answer_text": "I am. Just kidding. This question is impossible because the answer is totally subjective. As it would be in response to any profession, or with anything, really. Could you say, with total confidence, who the greatest physician is? Or, what the best meal is and be prepared to defend it against all others? What about the greatest place to take a vacation? The best place to live above all others? Have you tasted every food, vacationed everywhere and checked out everywhere there is to reside? The thing about detectives is that there are so many different specialties within the field. Those who conduct surveillance. Death scene investigators. Forensics. Research investigators, and so on. It would be literally impossible to choose one out of all of the sub-specialties. And, then be completely objective about your choice. ",

But I will always remember my daughter texting me that it was hard to work when she was sooo in love. I texted back who are you in love with? She answered, Sherlock Holmes of course! God mom you are so yesterday. I thought that was hilarious. ",
