            "answer_text": "How to even begin answering this: I once wrote in my private writings, If liberty was God's gift to American in the 18th century, Abraham Lincoln was the gift He gave to America in the 19th Century. I have a hard time overestimating his importance because literally everything he did was so perfectly timed, so meaningful, and so effective that even his political enemies often marvelled or became his friends and allies. 1. He was extremely selfless and quick to forgive. Most of Lincoln's cabinet was made up his rivals from the 1860 Republican Convention.  In previous administrations, Presidents filled their cabinets with cronies or spineless ciphers. Seward, Chase, Bates, and Blair were all very capable men and were all very good at their cabinet positions.  When Lincoln made changes, they were filled by capable men, most notably Edwin M. Stanton as Secretary of War.  Lincoln also gave several men multiple chances to succeed or fail, such as General McClellan.   2. Lincoln knew the art of taking the blame when it best suited.  When many were calling for Stanton to resign, Lincoln made a speech not only protecting Stanton but personally taking the blame for the failures that Stanton's critics were trying to use against the Secretary of War.  By taking the blame himself, he protected Stanton (whom he needed desperately as secretary of war), he built trust and confidence with Stanton (and, by extension, the rest of the cabinet), silenced Stanton's enemies, and diverted the blame to a place where his enemies couldn't touch (himself, elected president and was more or less untouchable there until the end of the term).  Lincoln knew that blaming his predecessor was political suicide. 3. Lincoln was an excellent judge of character.  He was able to judge people's motives better than they themselves, and was able to rise above that, able to make proper decisions in spite of it.  Secretary of Treasury Chase was never a loyal member of the cabinet: even as secretary he was using his influence to undermine Lincoln's chances at getting renominated in 1864.  Knowing Chase's political treachery, he kept Chase on for months, as he was supremely capable of financing the war.  Only mid-1864, long after much of the heavy-lifting was over, did Lincoln finally accept Chase's fourth resignation letter, much to Chase's surprise. 4. Lincoln didn't worry about side issues.  When General Grant was facing Gen. Lee, he sent back massive numbers of dead and wounded, and some were calling Grant a butcher.  Even Mary Lincoln criticized Grant's losses of men. Lincoln refused to caught up in the details (we have to call the deaths of thousands of soldiers details, sadly), and recognized Grant's talents of defeating his enemies. 5. Lincoln, better than any other President, was an excellent judge of his constituents. Consider this, in 1861, Maryland was on the cusp of secession; they tore up rails and cut telegraph lines, endangering Washington, but in 1864, Maryland ratified a new state constitution, outlawing slavery.  Had Lincoln tried to end slavery in 1861, Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky, and Delaware would all have seceded; but by the end of 1862, the country was ready for the Emancipation Proclamation, black soldiers, and a change in the nature of the war.  By the end of the war Maryland was the fourth state to ratify the 13th Amendment ending slavery.  The timing was perfect. There's a reason Lincoln has more biographies than any other President: he was successful when many of his opponents would have failed, he led when many others were afraid to step out, and he could read people extremely well. His reputation as a great President is well-earned, and all have much to learn from this western lawyer from Illinois. ",

            "answer_text": "Lincoln constantly and unfailingly fought against slavery and slave power for the entirety of his political career.  From opposing the Mexican American war and fighting against the slaveocracy spreading into the federal territory, to freeing slaves in the rebellious south by the point of the bayonet in 1862, to pressuring the border states of Maryland (1864),[1 Missouri (1865), one of the Confederate states, Tennessee (1865), and the new state of West Virginia (1865) to emancipate using more pacific means, the man fought tooth and nail against slavery within the realm of political, military, and strategic feasibility.  His peace overtures, the ten percent plan, were predicated on Emancipation  It is a shame that slave holding traitors in the border states prevented him from acting immediately, but he also was fighting the greatest and most terrible war this nation has ever seen in its history.  Securing the logistical bloodline for Sherman and Grant as they delivered the hammer blows that destroyed the slaveocracy of the South once and for all unfortunately had to take precedence over the immediacy of emancipation in states like Kentucky and Maryland.  Since he still operated under a democratic system the entire time, he could only pressure, wheedle, and plead for a state like Delaware to do the moral thing and emancipate. The last thing Lincoln fought for before a real white supremacist put a bullet in his brain was for the passage of the 13th amendment.   Lincoln's 1864 party platform resolved to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment, and while he was murdered before he could see its passage, his successors were able to fulfill his dream of the eradication of slavery through enshrinement of emancipation in the highest law of the land. Slavery is part of American history, but so is the eradication of slavery.  The Confederates made very clear they were founding their nation to defend and spread the institution of slavery, whilst the Union, however imperfectly, fought and ended it.  One side represents repentance and atonement for past historical sins, the other a denial and maintenance of human bondage as the very basis of its ideological underpinning. ",
