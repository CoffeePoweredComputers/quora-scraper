Those two time periods are pretty far apart in terms of what was happening. Of course, it could also be an example of cherry picking in order to make your comparisons look better. ",

There was roughly the same economy and roughly the same political situation. Obama\u2019s first three years are an apples and oranges with the economy Trump inherited. ",
