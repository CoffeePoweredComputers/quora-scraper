            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat was the origin of the Black-Jewish alliance of the 1960s?\u201d It was an alliance of common goals. The Jewish people were persecuted for centuries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It did not stop when they arrived in the New World, and it did not stop even when \u201call men were created equal\u201d. From those centuries of persecution one of the things the Jewish people learned is that they will never be free as long as any people are enslaved. Two of the \u201cpillars\u201d of the KKK were \u201cKoons\u201d and \u201cKites\u201d. Blacks and Jews had a common enemy in racism and joined forces to fight it.
