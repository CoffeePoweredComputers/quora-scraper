            "answer_text": "Hi Andy, we know very little about ancient Philistine genetics. It has only been recently that a Philistine cemetery has been discovered and very few skeletons from it have been sequenced for DNA. The results are showing a local population with transient South European admixture but it is unclear where the minor European elements is coming from. Most likely from the Western Mediterranean because it brought some Western Hunter-Gatherer ancestry to the Middle East which is almost nonexistent in Greece but research is ongoing. You can read about this piece of research here: Ancient DNA sheds light on the genetic origins of early Iron Age Philistines Additionally, you can see a previous answer I\u2019ve written to a similar question: Ral Cheva's answer to If the Philistines were transplanted Minoans, how come they didn't continue the civilization of the Minoans?

So any now existing people who claim to be descendants of the Philistines are of Greek origin, not Middle Eastern. ",
