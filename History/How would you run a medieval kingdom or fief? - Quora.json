            "answer_text": "What would my medieval fief look like?Well, roughtly like this:  Except I would live in the castle.  What else? 1.) I would use the modern knowledge of how disease works and establish hygienic standards and mandatory bathing on a regular basis to keep everyone less dirty. People die less often from hygiene related illnesses.  2.) I would also gather a bunch of skilled craftsmen and start developing prototypes of steam engines. Once we have a working machine, we use it in the agriculture for things like ploughing to ease the labor of the peasants. 3.) I would befriend the local Bishop and/or bribe him to make him ensure everyone else that my inventions and ideas are simply brilliant and/or come from divine inspiration as to prevent being accused of magic.  3.) Everyone loves me. ",
