            "answer_text": "Some interesting answers\u2026 The Sterling is a STEN derivative, where Patchett - who designed the improvements - agreed to wait until WW2 had ended before presenting his bill. When he did present the bill it included a blank space for the number of weapons produced (He was supposed to be paid a sum per gun) The War Department however refused to divulge the number, which they claimed was a military secret! Patchett had to go to court to get a figure (and get paid what he was owed!) \u201cSterling\u201d is the name of his company. The last Sterling model looked vaguely futuristic - square cross section, rather than circular. Designed to be manufactured under licence by third-world customers. (It flopped) The Sterling, (like most SMGs) fires from an open bolt. Less common is its use of Advanced Primer Ignition. Pull the trigger, the bolt leaps forward, strips a round from the magazine, feeds it into the chamber\u2026 and (unusually) fires it BEFORE the bolt reaches battery - the \u201cbang\u201d comes while the bolt is still moving forwards. The bang produces recoil, which pushes the bolt backwards. But, nonetheless, the bolt leaping forwards and changing the weapon\u2019s centre of gravity mid-shot, which is not conducive to accuracy. But it IS well-known, well-liked, and pretty reliable. The H&K MP5, on the other hand fires from a closed bolt: pull the trigger, the hammer drops, making it an inherently more accurate weapon. ",

            "answer_text": "If used as intended very good. If used single shot at 100m mehh. Was once on a range doing the annual range practice. Strange officer turned up. Took over range and showed us how to use it short bursts at short range as a close quarter combat weapon it is very good. Probably violated some range orders didn't care. Whoever he was range warden wasn't going to mess with him. Not going to get into a long range fire fight with it clearing buildings or trenches ideal. Good enough for the imperial storm troopers:) ",
