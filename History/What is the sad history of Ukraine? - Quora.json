            "answer_text": "Holodomor which happened mostly because Soviet Russians stole all their grain and killed millions of Ukrainians due to starvation. This is officially recognized as a genocide. Soviet Russians led by Stalin then sold this food abroad and bought missiles and other military junk. From 3 to 12 millions Ukrainians died due to this genocide (source: Holodomor - Wikipedia). I want to remind you that the entire World War II resulted in ~24 million soldiers death (source: World War II - Wikipedia), so just imagine how terrifying this Soviet Russians crime in Ukraine was as it killed nearly half of that and all the victims were peaceful civilians: mostly farmers with children. Soviet Russians forcefully takes away food from Ukrainians:   Ukrainians dying because of starvation caused by the Soviet Russians:      (starving Ukrainian children, similar to what you currently still often see in Africa)  (starving Ukrainian family) Nearly 100 years had passed and Russia, Russians still bully Ukraine and Ukrainians. I hope they will never again trust them and will finally break free from their jail and tyranny. The state is still above the citizens in Russia and they rather buy missiles instead of improving their citizens living standards, which are terrible compared to Europe. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is a bit misconstrued. Perhaps, \u201cWhy is the history of Ukraine sad?\u201d or \u201cWhat are the sad parts of the history of Ukraine?\u201d be more correct. However, I will try to answer the posted question. The sad history of Ukraine is its people. Throughout history people of Ukraine (or people who lived in parts which are nowadays called Ukraine) had done baaaaaad decisions, that, in the aftermath, made their or their fellows\u2019 fate worse or much worse than it\u2019s been before. Or far not better, anyway. Just a glimpse at history will give you way too many events, which scream \u201cOhgawd! What have you idiots DONE?! WHY?!!\u201d, \u201cYe gods, way to go, dipwits, enjoy your shitty life getting even worse now!\u201d: 1147 son of Kyiv Grand Prince Volodymyr Monomakh Yuri Dolgoruky had been said to establish Moscow. Dubious move, as had been proven many a time later on. Two years after the third capture of Kyiv in 1150 he had been killed off for that sin. 1618 hetman of Ukrainian cossacks Petro Sahaydachnyi did not capture Moscow to have it burnt down, although the city was besieged by the Cossacks\u2019-Polish-Lithuanian joint expeditionary task force (although not \u201cexpeditionary\u201d :) now, but Ukraine, Lithuania, and Poland do have now a joint brigade, fancy that). True, this was due to the Polish guys\u2019 uneasiness when they thought about rather making a Deulin peace accord, which got them acres and acres of Moscow state\u2019s lands. But Sahaydachnyi\u00b4s failure to have Moscow burnt down was generally frowned upon later on nevertheless. 1654 hetman Khmelnytsky stroke a deal with Muscovy in Pereyaslav, which played and still plays a big part in the essence of the appetite for keeping Ukraine under Russia\u2019s influence. Needless to say, the decision brought tragic consequences to Ukrainian people. Before his death Khmelnytskys was very sorry for that, as he understood, what Bismarck understood later on, and had been proven yet again with the Budapest memorandum: treaties with Russia are not worth the paper they are written on. Moving on. While cossacks\u2019 hetman Ivan Mazepa fights alongside Charles XII of Sweden in the Great Northern War (oh, how Russians hate him for that. Can you believe him - he fought against our Peter the Great! How dare he betray Him! They STILL, to THIS DAY, recite anathemas to Mazepa in their Orthodox Churches! Something that Muscovy hates the most is when people they consider to be their underlings, as was the case with Ukrainians since Pereyaslav, actually take up arms to fight against them), the fight proves unsuccessful, as part of cossacks\u2019 leadership is in opposition to Mazepa, and, instead, fought for Peter I. Mostly due to their own personal wealth interests being safely aligned with Moscovy\u2019s interests. Yet another chance to break free from northern \u201cbrothers\u201d is wasted. \u201cTreason\u201d of cossacks under Mazepa takes empress Catherine to such hatred hights, that she commands the Zaporozhyan Sich to be demolished in 1774. 1917\u20131918. Kyiv after the Bolsheviks\u2019 putsch was in many Ukrainian governments\u2019 hands, including bourgeois, the authoritarian, and, finally the socialist-democratic government of Vinnichenko, who, as naive socialists back then, was firm in that it is better to strike a deal with Bolsheviks and trust them. This brought Ukraine back into Muscovy\u2019s hands. Again. And now into quite a firm grip, which resulted in Holodomor Famine, Executed Renaissance and \u201ctalented\u201d general Vatutin killing loads of unprepared Ukrainian nationals (so-called black-jackets, the conscript units from the civilian population of the just liberated parts of Left-Bank Ukraine) in the surge for Kyiv in 1943. 1991. The first presidential elections in Ukraine. Newly found independence means close to nothing to the Sovietized population, much of which had been brought to Ukraine after the 2. World War from other parts of the Soviet Union, and so they elect a previously Secretary General of CPU Leonid Kravchuk instead of Western-oriented Chornovil. Thus, Ukraine is doomed to drag its existence into the oligarch-managed country instead of a normal Western-type country. 1994. Ukraine signs a Budapest Memorandum. She gives up nuclear weapons (third largest pile of such weapons in the world) in exchange of, you will laugh, Russia\u2019s (among others) guarantees of security and respecting Ukraine\u2019s borders. How that played out, is now clear to everyone. 2004. The chance is given again. Through Orange revolution. The chance is blown. Again. Through the likes of Yulia Tymoshenko and Yanukovych getting the power and yanking the country yet again into the realm of Muscovy\u2019s interests by signing the caballing Gas treaties and prolonging Russias Black Sea Fleet stay in Sevastopol. 2019. The chance is given again. Through the Revolution of Dignity. And is blown yet again, by electing the current Nincompoop \u201cYanelokh\u201d Zelensky into the president\u2019s office. So, as the kind reader may see, Ukrainian people like to shoot themselves into their feet by often forgetting the history of the fallacy of trusting Russians, and making utterly disastrous choices by this.
