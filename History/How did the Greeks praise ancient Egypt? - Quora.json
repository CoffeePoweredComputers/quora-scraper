            "answer_text": "Praise was mostly literary (Herodotus, for example, visited Egypt and wrote about it), but they certainly emulated what they admired. Notably the \u2018Greek\u2019 column is directly derived from its Egyptian original. There was also a religious influence, especially after Alexander\u2019s conquest, leading to a syncretist deity as Serapis. The Isis cult was also influential, eventually spreading through the Roman empire after the demise of the diadoch empires. From the Ptolemaic period dates the dynastic chronology by the Greek priest Manetho. The Ptolemees were very much aware of Egyptian culture. Even though they kept rather aloof of the population at large, it was perfectly possible for an Egyptian to make a career under the Ptolemees. ",

            "answer_text": "The ancient Greeks recognized Egypt as an ancient source on knowledge. One must remember that, in the Periclean Athens, the 5th century AD, the Great Pyramid was already 2000 years old. Herodotus devoted the first book of his History to Egypt; Plato invoked Egyptian wisdom in the Timaeus. There is a body of works known as the Hermetica, which reached their final form between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, which posit ancient Egyptian sources for Greek philosophy. They possibly originate in earlier, lost, Pharaonic texts. (Ficino, who made the first translation of Plato from Greek into Latin in the 15th century, translated the Hermetica first.)

            "answer_text": "The great Greek civilization is a product of what Greek masters, scientists, and philosophers studied and transferred from the Ancient Egyptian Civilization. Sure they add a lot to it but all the very basics they build upon came from Egypt. You can simply say that the Greek civilization is a son or daughter of Egyptian civilization. For more details here is a link from 1951 when Greek university honored Dr. Taha Hussien , it is full of details about who studied what and where in Egypt, promise you will be amazed : https://ar.wikisource.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%AF_930/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1_%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86 Hope you can read it as it is in Arabic.

            "answer_text": "Greeks happily credited ancient Egypt but often could not accurately trace the origin of ideas, when they were co-created or discovered, when borrowed, when general knowledge in the eastern Mediterranean world from before careful records, etc. You can find individual references by the Greek you care about from Herodotus forward. With Alexander forward you get a blending, so when an ethnic Greek in Alexandria writes something, shall we view it as \u201cEgyptian\u201d? While tradesmen went all over uppercrust writers who left us travelogues are few and of course repeat rumor and myth as often as history. ",
