            "answer_text": "Well, I don\u2019t know which sex you are or what your intentions towards Adolph, but your evaluation of his looks is mind-boggling, considering:  That he had bad teeth and bad breath.[1] His mouth was so foul-smelling that when he began to speak people took one step behind. That was not because he was intimidating\u2026He had scars left by trench warfare, one of them possibly resulting from a gas attack.[2] Some victims of gas attacks got pretty nasty scars on their bodies and Hitler was notoriously shy\u2026Even in his lifetime, he was considered no beauty model.[3] He wasn\u2019t tall, he didn\u2019t have fair hair or light-coloured eyes and his nose was notoriously unshapely. His official portraits were often doctored or actually paintings instead of photographs. This photograph serves as an example of careful choice of angle and light to favour the depiction of the f\u00fchrer: light incides from the upper left, illuminating his eyes and making them appear lighter (my own eyes would look as blue as the sky if photographed in black and white under such light, and they\u2019re definitely brown, or \u2018dark honey\u2019 if you prefer). Sideways lighting also made his nose look thinner than it actuallyl was.  He looked nothing like the \u2018ideal beauty\u2019 he and his followers considered beautiful. Some have ventured that his moustache actually covered a cleft lip scar,[4] though this is difficult to prove \u2014 however, the very story hints at the fact that people perceived his upper lip and his nose as unshapely. Under less than ideal lighting and angle, like in film stills, his unshapely potato nose, his rotten teeth and his general swine appearance were undeniable. Prison records taken while he was interned after the Beer Hall Putsch suggest he had only one testicle and a micro-penis resulting from a genetic deformity called \u2018hypospadias\u2019, which causes the urethra to open under the testicles, forcing him to urinate sitting and, if you had not yet concluded that so far, rendering him completely \u2018powerless\u2019.[5] His sexual life is the subject of much debate, and with or without such conditions he was known to have a troubled approach to women.All in all, Hitler looks more like a creepy old fart with some mental and physical issues than someone that would be called \u2018cute\u2019. Your ability to see beauty even in him is commendable, but it only diminishes the value of your praise: if you can see beauty in everyone, then beauty is not something special.

            "answer_text": "Probably not - he had his admirers among German \u201cupper crust \u201c ladies when he was up and coming - being invited by one in particular as a kind of entertainer in order to regale them with his crazy speeches.  I had a friend once who went through an adolescent stage of admiring \u201cthe Fuhrer\u201c  although I am pleased to say that he eventually grew out of it However he was a very mixed up person who could never keep a job. I would suggest that if you have any sense of admiration for the man that you be tactful about it - it is likely to offend any Jewish person for a start and probably many more .  Also try to study some of Hitler\u2019s less cute actions and policies.  See then if you still find him endearing. ",
