NO VOTE! ),Blacks to jail, prevent them from voting, ( what, you\u2019re a convicted felon ? NO VOTE! ),Browns to Mexico, prevent them from voting, ( what, you look like an illegal, even though your family was here before there was a US ? NO VOTE! ),even, prohibit abortion NOT for moral reasons,but to Make America WHITE Again.\u201c\u2026 to populate is to rule \u2026\u201dand pregnant black women in the US already have a higher death rate than women in non-industrialized nations, so they don\u2019t need to abort, they just die anyway, along with their black babies, a two-for, according to the Make America WHITE Again crowd, and even if they live, off to jail with them with the highest incarceration rate in the world, and prohibit them from voting that way.It\u2019s about Making America WHITE Again.

            "answer_text": "Making abortion illegal benefits a community by ensuring fewer women will die from pregnancy-related complications. No, wait\u2014it won\u2019t. Outlawing abortion benefits a community because it makes sure that all products of conception receive adequate housing, nutrition, medical treatment and education until they are adults. Well, no, not that either. Making abortion illegal guarantees all children will be parented with love and affection, and none will be abused or neglected. Nope on that one too. Criminalizing abortion means a woman will not experience economic hardship, underemployment, or career interruption because of her pregnancy and childrearing. Uh, no, I guess not. Abolishing legal abortion ensures that no victim of sexual violence, child or adult, will have to gestate and deliver her rapist\u2019s child. Oh crap, that won\u2019t either. Outlawing abortion benefits communities because it means there will no longer be any children spending years in institutions or temporary foster care while they wait to be adopted. No, that\u2019s not likely either. The only benefit I can possibly imagine is the smug, self-righteous satisfaction anti-abortion activists derive from a position that harms others. ",
