            "answer_text": "This question really annoyed me. At a surface level the question indicates a lack of knowledge of Macedonian royal traditions. Macedonian kings were supposed to marry several women to get several sons. Philip, Alexander\u2019s father had married several women including the Thracian Meda and the Illyrian Audata to seal treaties with neighbours. In any case this had been common practice for centuries as proven by the recent archaeological find of the The Lady Of Aigai, the wife of Amyntas I, a Lydian princess. When Mardonius reached Macedonia her daughter, Gygaea, was given as a wife to a Persian satrap thus securing the Macedonians position in the Persian court. Women, as was the case even as late as the 19th c., were collateral of international agreements. Collateral they may have been, but chattel they were not. The burial of the Lydian Lady in the most hallowed ground of the royal cemetery and the riches that accompanied her (see picture) prove that she occupied the position of consort and high priestess. In short, Alexander\u2019s royal family had always had dynastic relations with foreign houses and they honoured their foreign consorts.  My favourite detail: the diadem is adorned with the scene of the blinding of the Cyclops. It seems Homer was already a favourite two centuries before Alexander:  At a deeper level (and this is where my annoyance stems) it challenges everything that Alexander is supposed to represent. You see, the Greek schoolbook version of Alexander is a Greek monarch who in contrast to imperialists of later ages (e.g. British and French) respected local cultures and demonstrated this even in his personal life. A person who believed that personal value transcended ethnic divisions. We have been taught to respect him exactly because he married a woman from Sogdiana (Roxana was NOT Persian). The question demonstrates that there is now an undercurrent that rejects this all encompassing view of Alexander and tries to keep him confined to the paradigm of a pure, Greek monarch. How odious, how demeaning to the man\u2019s vision! It really makes my skin creep that people impose their modern prejudices to historic figures. How very 1984! ",
