All Iranian languages, credit: Valentyn Stetsyuk They are spoken simply because people used to speak them and there was never a lack of speakers which enabled them to be spoken by the generations which would replace the previous ones and be replaced by new ones, so the language was taught, spoken and therefore still is alive. Iran has been a crossroad and a centre of many empires and civilizations which thrived, spread their cultures and languages. ",
