            "answer_text": "There are quite a few interesting primary and secondary sources notably Primary-Aquinaldo\u2019s own memoirs such as \u201cTrue Version of the Philippine Revolution\u201d and another one in Tagalog, Prime Minister Apolinario Mabini\u2019s Revolucion Filipina, General Alejandrino\u2019s journals and quantitities of personal letters, official corespondences and newspaper headlines. Note that newspapers of the times were no less biased as newspapers of today but nevertheless considered primary sources. Also, official corespondences and even personal letters can have a restrained content. After all, these pre-democracy Filipinos did not want to end up in the garote or gallows. Furthermore, the primary sources has contradicting accounts of events, simply explained as the writers were human and subject to bias. Secondary sources, which were based on primary sources added the author\u2019s own personal anaylysis (and bias) is notably Nick Joaquin\u2019s \u201cA Question of Heroes\u201d, where he dedicates an entire article or chapter of the book on the personal life of General Emilio Aquinaldo. One can only compare this to contrasting accounts of other secondary sources such as Teodoro Agoncillo though Agoncillo wrote more on Andres Bonifacio and how Aguinaldo affected him. Other secondary sources include Rise and Fall of Antonio Luna by Jose (the basis of the film General Luna) and how Aquinaldo affected him. As such, the story of Emilio Aguinaldo is vast. He was a prominent figure of the Katipunan, the Spanish-American War, Philippine-American War AND Japanese Occupation. To answer the question, \u201cWho Exactly Was Aguinaldo?\u201d, let us limit the information to his personal character. There are contradicting accounts of Emilio Aguinaldo\u2019s scholarly capabilities. Nick Joaquin mentions that Aguinaldo barely understood Spanish as he did not finish even high school. Joaquin mused how Aguinaldo could have survived a meeting between Filipino Patriots and American Military Officials in Singapore and Hong Kong which was conducted in Spanish being the medium between the English speaking Americans and Spanish speaking Patriots. HOWEVER, there are actual video footages after the war by American journalists where Emilio Aguinaldo spoke fluent Spanish and his only means to communicate with the Americans (who probably knew a little Spanish due to neighbouring Mexico).Emilio Aguinaldo was a merchant, a \u201cmangangalakal\u201d or more commonly known in Filipino or Tagalog as \u201cViajero\u201d. He dropped out of high school to engage in the family business of merchandising. The family had their own merchant ships to carry out trade. As such, he was always travelling. During Spanish settlement and rule, positions in the local government seems hereditary. I have yet to confirm if \u201celections\u201d did not exist in the Philippines until America introduced it. Emilio Aguinaldo was Cabeza de Barangay then Gobernadorcillo/Capitan Municipal (Mayor) of Cavite El Viejo, now Kawit, Cavite. Emilio Aguinaldo was mostly successful during the Revolution because of this political machinery. He had access to the Spanish Navy Commander in Cavite vital information on its military situation as well as complete access to the municipal arsenal.For a Filipino during the times, Emilio Aquinaldo was a \u201cmatandang binata\u201d . He married late in his late 20s. Most Filipinos married at 18 years old during his time. This is according to the analysis of Nick Joaquin, a major contribution to his \u201cinsecurities\u201d later on during the First Philippine Republic added his undergraduate status. Makes you wonder why Patriots made a big issue of the more wide reader Andres Bonifacio as \u201cwalang pinagaralan\u201d while Emilio Aguinaldo\u2019s sorry state of academic background had never been brought up.Emilio Aguinaldo was elected President of the Republic that succeeded the Katipunan in Tejeros while he was fighting in the battlefield. The Magdiwang packed election (Bonifacio allies) elected Aguinaldo, a Magdalo, who did not seek any position in the new government. His closest politcal allies were present in the elections though.Emilio Aguinaldo was \u201cPrincipales\u201d but was not \u201cIlustrado\u201d unlike Andres Bonifacio who had close links to Jose Rizal due to his membership in La Liga Filipina, a society of ilustrados or Manila High Society. As such, Andres Bonifacio was westernised and liberal than Emilio Aquinaldo. As such, Emilio Aguinaldo was a seasoned native politician and a member of the local nobility contrary to Andres Bonifacio who was an artisan (the merchant class that overthrew the French King in Europe). Both were freemasons though.Emilio Aguinaldo\u2019s repeated refusal to fight a guerrilla warfare and stubborness in Baler (Los Ultimos de Filipinas or Last of Spain) was due to his seasoned political insights. He believed war will not be won in the battlefield alone but in the political front. He was desperate for recognition of independence from the western powers (thus his insistence on a frontal war despite lack of resources AND stubborness in Baler because he wanted a signed surrender paper to show the western powers. He eventually gave in to Luna\u2019s war plan but too late. America had already overran his wartime capital in Pangasinan and was running for his life with a few hundred men left.Emilio Aguinaldo unsuccessfully ran for the presidency of the Commonwealth in 1935 against Manuel Quezon, one of his close aide during the revolution and also a prominent figure of the Philippine Revolution.Emilio Aguinaldo collaborated with the Japanese in 1942. Japan waded into the Philippines with General Artemio Ricarte. During the Philippine-American War, the Republic had hoped that Japan would intervene. As late as 1942, the patriots were still hoping for this intervention and finally happened during World War II. Japan turned out to be worse than the United States. General Ricarte died fleeing from Macarthur\u2019s forces in the Mountain Province together with Japanese generals. Emilio was tried after the war and was acquitted.Emilio Aguinaldo lived to old age in the 1960s. Before he died, he had asked Diosdado Macapagal when he would get a statue in his honour in the capital city of Manila.I have yet to verify the authencity of that book \u201cTrue Version of the Philippine Revolution\u201d by Emilio Aguinaldo. It had not been mentioned by older historians but has recently surfaced in ibooks. If you can get a hold of it, it is an interesting read. Among the most interesting accounts in it was that the First Philippine Republic had a navy of eight ships, formerly merchant ships converted to warships, donated by rich Filipinos. ",

            "answer_text": "Emilio Aguinaldo was a Filipino patriot who led a somewhat successful revolt against Spanish occupation and unsuccessful revolt against the American occupation after his nation was ceded to the US as a result of the Spanish American war. The US used him to end the insurrection by having him swear allegiance to America. While this was a forced oath, Aguinaldo said he was seeing his soldiers killed without accomplishing change. Because of the resistance to US occupation, America\u2019s actions were quite barbaric during the initial occupation but the capitulation of Aguinaldo as the century turned led to a more positive relationship. Unlike Spain who simply plundered Philippine resources, the US built up infrastructure and gradually eroded the umbilical cord leading to independence. Aguinaldo is revered by the Philippine people and rightly so. He was their George Washington. He lived to age 97 and his estate is maintained much the same way as Mount Vernon. For no additional charge! Slightly off topic; World War 2 gelled a strong relationship between the two nations and 1946 saw complete independence. It also added new heroes to the Filipino list, including General Westmorland among the middle and upper classes and Lt. Edwin Ramsey, who led the resistance movement among the Tagalot indigenous people. Completely off topic but a favorite interest of mine; The m1911 sidearm (.45 cal Automatic Colt Pistol) saw its first effective use in the Philippine insurrection when it replaced the super .38 revolver. It sacrificed accuracy for greater stopping power at close quarters, essential in combat situations. It was standard issue for Cavalry soldiers like Lt. Ramsey, (Leader of the last cavalry charge of the US army,) during WW2. ",
