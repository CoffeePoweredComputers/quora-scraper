            "answer_text": "Yes. Remember the Crimean Crisis in 2014. And think about it, before the USSR collapsed, Putin worked for the KGB. So yes. And I honestly think he\u2019s going to do it. I can almost guarantee you because of covid19, everyone will be distracted, including Ukraine and East Germany, and yeah he\u2019s going to strike and bring back the USSR. And I mean, Belarus would help them with that. And yeah, the Soviet Union will be back, the anthem will be back, Leningrad and Stalingrad will become things again. There will be statues of Putin everywhere and other Soviet Leaders, including Stalin. Putingrad might become a thing. Half of Russia and a few other post soviet states actually miss the USSR and would work with Putin. I guarantee you while Trump and his administration are trying to get kids back in school and try to ban tiktok, that\u2019s when they\u2019ll strike. And remember, Russia has one of the biggest militaries in the world. And combine that number with any post soviet state that would help them. And don\u2019t forget about Russia\u2019s allies. China and North Korea and Cuba. They would most likely send troops to help the Red Army. Even if the US got involved, it would be too late. And not to forget that Putin can threaten anyone with nukes now. So it is inevitable that this will probably happen within the next month or two. ",

            "answer_text": "Russia has several problems. The first is demographics. It is not making enough babies. Within five years the young male population is going to decrease rather quickly. If Russia is going to make a military move it has to be now. The second problem is that Russia can no longer feed itself. It, therefore, has to buy food and its only export to pay for this is oil and gas. Both of these are dropping in value. If Putin is going to rebuild Russia it has to be now because in five years it will not be possible. Frankly, I don\u2019t think it is possible now. ",
