            "answer_text": "Personally it's Edward the Fourth for me, although I concede his reign was far more impressive at the beginning than the end. Regardless he was really a bit of a Popstar for his time. He is described as Good looking, Blonde and Tall (Like a lot of the Plantagenets - Being tall helped when King) and as a young man he really had it all. He was a good fighter, charismatic and a popular commander amongst his men in the War of the Roses. Women litterally lined the streets for him when he would return to London. This celebrity like popularity in the Capital - meant that they would always open the gates for his armies and was actually one of his major advantages in the War of the Roses. As a very young man he was able to win three very important large scale battles. This included his last two which he fought after losing the throne he had originally captured from the incompetent Henry VI. He captured the throne in the first battle that he ever commanded after his father's and closest younger brother's recent and rather unnecessary deaths and won. He made a political blunder in choosing to marry Elizabeth Woodville, however personally I always liked the fact he married for love and not for political gain. Obviously something very uncommon for Royals at that time. This marriage was what lead to him falling out with his most powerful supporter in the Earl of Warrick and subsequent need to flee into exile on the Continent with Warrick changing sides sponsoring a return of Henry to the throne. In one of the Medieval periods great comebacks Edward was able to secure the support of his troublesome younger brother George the Duke of Clarence and his more loyal brother Richard (Later to become Shakespeare's infamous Richard the III) and defeat his enemies on his return to England in perhaps the two largest feild battles ever fought in Engalnd. Henry and his more capable son (Named after his father) and Warrick were all deceased by the end of the last major battle Edward fought. Unfortunately in later life he got fat and lazy which lead to his premature death which was a contributing factor amongst many others to the eventual demise of the Yorkist and in turn Plantangent Dynasty. This occurred several years later due to his younger brother Richard the Third charging to his death in battle against the forces of Henry Tudor. Regardless as a young man in his prime Edward always struck me as late Medieval England's David Beckham and for that reason he is my favorite. I prefer to not think of his later years but in reality most secure Kings in that period (Think Henry the VIII for an obvious example) did often usually have problems in later life with excess when it came to glutony and infidelity.

            "answer_text": "Of the \u201cBroom-handlers\u201d (which is what Plantagenet generally meant in French), my preference is Richard the Lionheart (Richard I, lived 1157\u201399). It was during his reign (1198\u201399) that Common Law was formalised and came into official operation. I also like Richard III but for no particular reason. Shame that Ricky-3 was buried in a city council carpark (but now in better premises). His direct descendant today is a carpenter somewhere in England. ",
