            "answer_text": "the definition \u201cdemocratic\u201d is itself very difficult, currently it is beeing used by people with huge media presence to define their friends and enemies. everybody wants to be democratic, but in truth and reality democracy can be almost like dictatorships or truly active. however for a democracy to be truly active and vivd, mane core realities have to be deeply imbeded in the democracy and the society. among many i write some i know out of my personal experience. society needs a common language, or means to understand each other.society needs an educated populationsociety needs a population with work morale.society needs a population that thinks socialist regarding the solution of the problems between each other.society needs a trusted mass media systemsociety needs a trusted financial system with the democratically regulated banking/financial system that serves the democracy.7. society needs basic economic stability for everyone involved in the democracy. such standards are quite huge and the democratic penetration into such a society are thin. for example children or less educated people might completely feel excluded out of that society. especially in young countries like in africa the democratic penetration can quickly be very small. and could look almost like in a medieval election of dukes and counts. which only an extremly small percentage of the population is able to decide and be involved. this way you can question yourself how widespread the circle of the democratically involved people are. for example even the muslim khalifate had its councils that commonly discussed decisions just like parliamentarian democracies do. so regarding this you can choose how you feel about a particular democracy in africa.

            "answer_text": "I made this map using data from the 2016 Democracy Index, an index made by the Economist Intelligence Unit:  A higher score means better democracy, based on this, Cape Verde is the most democratic nation in Africa. Countries that follow up with high democratic ratings include Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, Ghana, Senegal, Tunisia, and Lesotho. The least democratic nations in Africa \u2014 flagrantly authoritarian regimes, include Chad, Guinea-Bissau, the DRC, the CAR, and Equatorial Guinea. I left countries like Somalia and S. Sudan blank because of the scarcity of data and lack of government function. Western Sahara is also left blank because it lacks autonomy and a recognized government. ",

Yet there is a popular perception that Africa lags behind the rest of the world in this most nebulous of political terms. This is despite the fact that millions of people elsewhere in the world live under regimes that can be described as authoritarian, oppressive and undemocratic, while millions of people within Africa enjoy the benefits of relatively good governance. Former British leader Winston Churchill thought democracy was \u201cthe worst form of government, except for all the others\u201d. His words lays bare the imperfections of what we call democracy, but also hint at how difficult it is to define. 1) Democracy is not spreading across Africa Countries that describe themselves as democratic are members of a very broad church. They range from nations that respect citizens\u2019 political freedoms and civil liberties to those that repress dissent and hold elections that are neither free nor fair. Just as other regions of the world display varied systems of governance, there are discrepancies among African countries too ",

Many people here believe that better leaders come forward thru a party selection, than a people\u2019's election. So they vote democratically for a less democratic system. ;-) In the Netherlands many people consult an on-line platform, to check what party program is better inline with their political views, but then vote on the party they feel more attached to.

As a result, one too many African countries today are economically stagnant and cannot find a way out, when all they need to do is give their people the freedom to run their affairs themselves without much interference from the government. Without good governance, most African countries will never get ahead let alone just get by. You will notice that I have intentionally refrained from pointing at individual countries. I have also given credit to none of them simply because the lack of good governance is pervasive throughout Africa. ",
