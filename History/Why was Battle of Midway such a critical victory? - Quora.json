            "answer_text": "It was a critical victory for several reasons. It halted the Japanese advance eastward and ended the immediate threat to Hawaii. Hawaii was crucial for U.S. Navy plans to counter-advance across the Pacific once sufficient forces were built up. It ended the near free-reign the Japanese navy had had in the Pacific since the attack on Pearl Harbor, and it also inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese navy from which they would never fully recover. Even though the Japanese navy was still superior to the U.S. Navy in all respects after Midway, including aircraft carrier strength, the Japanese navy had lost four of its six best aircraft carriers and many very valuable pilots at Midway, and it could now count on significant U.S. opposition to future moves. The U.S. Pacific Fleet had not only survived, but it had inflicted severe damage on the Japanese navy in surviving. Had the U.S. Pacific Fleet been destroyed at Midway, Hawaii would have been in grave danger of being lost, the Japanese navy would have had free reign in the Pacific, the West Coast of North America would have been completely exposed to the Japanese navy, and the American advance across the Pacific that actually happened would have likely not been possible. The most viable path to victory against Japan in the event of a defeat at Midway would have been through the Aleutians, and Japan would have been far tougher nut to crack had that been the case. Midway is often referred to as the battle that turned the tide of the war. I think it is more accurate to say that it was the battle that began to turn the tide of the war. Japan, with her still superior forces, still had the upper hand after Midway, but no longer an almost free hand. Midway kept the U.S. Navy firmly in the fight, and it set the stage for the subsequent Battle for Guadalcanal. Guadalcanal was the battle that truly did fully turn the tide of the Pacific War in favor of the U.S. In summary, the U.S. Navy\u2019s victory at Midway bought enough time and space to make complete victory over Japan possible.

            "answer_text": "Multiple reasons. First, it was the first major defeat of the Japanese navy in the Pacific war. They had run, roughshod, over all opponents since Pearl Harbor and, had they successfully taken Midway, would have been a direct threat to the American possession of Hawaii. A morale as well as a military victory for the Americans. Second, the core of Japanese naval power was the reach and strength of its aircraft carriers. As Yamamoto understood before the war started, dominance in the vast Pacific would be decided by air power, not battleships. Midway took four of their best carriers off the board and Japanese industry couldn't hope to replace them as quickly as the more powerful American industry, now accelerating into overdrive, could. The day after Midway, the Japanese still had the most powerful navy in the Pacific. However, without those lost carriers and aircrews, could no longer expand its reach. They were forced into a defensive mode while Americans quickly learned how to fight them more competently and the American industrial juggernaut began to produce superior planes, ships and in volumes the Imperial General Staff (IGS) couldn't hope to match. It took another eighteen months or so for U.S. dominance to be really visible. Guadalcanal was a six month test of wills where American grit over tactically superior Japanese forces finally prevailed, completely astounding the IGS. Losing at Midway cost the Japanese the edge. Losing at Guadalcanal proved it. More than two years of brutal combat remained, but, by the Battle of the Philippine Sea in 1944, naval dominance in the Pacific had swung so completely in favor of the Americans that even the arrogant IGS realized they had a losing hand. By the subsequent Battle of Leyte Gulf, the four remaining Japanese carriers were only suitable as decoys and the once dominant Zeros so completely outclassed and outnumbered that they were mostly deemed useful for suicide missions.
