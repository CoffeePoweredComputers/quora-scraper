            "answer_text": "That question cannot be answered in any short form, except to point out that it WAS the Western Roman Empire that survived and the eastern empire that faded away, which began in 325 C.E. in Nicaea, and was finally nailed-down with the allowance of the Germanic Barbarian tribes\u2019 take-over of the empire around 476 C.E. \u2014 all with Vatican Blessing . Although Byzantium continued after 476 C.E. it really never retained the aura of Roman Empire, mostly due to it not being in Europe proper. The entire Blessing of the Barbarians being allowed to take-over the Western Empire had to do with the intent for Catholicism to hijack the Empire in favor of a \u201cHoly Roman Empire\u201d - which it actually did achieve by 800 C.E. and which came to and end in 1800. The only thing that can be concluded is; if Western Rome fell that Christianity would resemble the original Gnostic form, over the Paulian Resurrection Type promoted by the Vaticanized Catholic Christianity. If this were the case, we would not have had a Catholic type christianity in Europe - most likely would not have had a Vatican, and Christianity would have been the religion of the teachings of Jesus and not the promotion of Resurrection God teaching which originated with Paul. Now this topic is of great interests but would take a couple volumes in book form to give it justice with referencing. ",

            "answer_text": "We would have more peace less worry from the attempted moslem invasions,more graeco-Romano would survive without having to put up with the mess in the Balkans I call the 20th century the balkan war century as it began and ended in the balkans(Sarajevo began the Great War and the breakup of Yugoslavia ended it with Bosnia-Herzegovina). Europe might have stronger and more united capable of destroying genghis khan and with the leadership of Charles Martel,France might have chased back the berber invaders and caused to run faster than they did.Egypt would still be free of Moslem influence and so would the near east,Arabs would be sent home with their tail between their legs and there would be more unity. Spain would not have had that stupid civil war amongst the verigenians thereby causing a fool to invite some berber military assistance thereby bringing such scum to invade and to cause devastation in Spain (I have always hated unbridled greed so what happened to Crassus was fine by me,or even the pope would have no power he will stay as he is bishop of Rome third in power to the patriarch of Alexandria so the priests could marry and women being the first clergy and deacons would have more power than these misogynistic useless clergy).Charlamagne would be unnecessary and other so called emperors that owed their power to the crowning of the pope,Gregory v11 might not have been able to push the investiture crisis there is the example pushed by this bishop of Rome to make the clergy celibate unlike the Greek church . We would all speak Latin ,now what I have written is counter factual for one of these ideas for one theory leading to another to happen had to work like a domino and one does not necessarily lead to another,but the important aspect is that we go with assumption that Rome able to evolve it\u2019s army with better training,hardware the scorpion might have been minuterized to its logical small to carry size and with the arrival of the stirrup from Japan a more efficient cavalry might have been used against atilla the Hun,who knows?
