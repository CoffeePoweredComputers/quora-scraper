            "answer_text": "We need wars to keep the population in check, indeed the human race is destroying itself due to overpopulation. The \u201cnuclear stalemate\u201d has basically ended major warfare and lead to there being too many people alive right now which is literally destroying the planet as we deplete our resources. In theory if we ever reduced the population to about 2 billion people and wound up with a single government that was capable of regulating population growth to keep it around that level we could end wars\u2026 the population would be low enough for everyone to have a decent standard of living without competition or destroying the environment. A single government/uber-culture able to regulate human reproduction would mean the biggest reason for people to fight (different ways of life) would be gone as well. Simply put technology would advance to the point where machines would do everything, including build and maintain each other, at this point we\u2019d have little to do but entertain ourselves, and face it\u2026 real war isn\u2019t fun for anyone. That said this is never happening. At the end of the day nobody wants to die, or see their loved ones die. Nobody is going to regulate the population, never mind reduce it. The future of humanity is going to be one of misery\u2026 your living at the high point right now. Our population will expand, we\u2019ll run out of resources, the current societies will gradually degenerate, and eventually humans will become feral beasts wondering how we did so much in the past and how we let it get to this point. We will continue to war among ourselves while overbreeding, and we\u2019ll be clubbing each other with rocks if nothing else until our sun finally dies out. We\u2019re pretty much a doomed species due to overpopulation and the resulting resource depletion and environmental destruction. On a lot of levels it\u2019s the WMD that did it\u2026 without them needing to actually be used. I expect this will depress people as much as it does me (the truth sucks), but basically be happy you got to be alive to see our species at it\u2019s height. ",

            "answer_text": "Democracy. TRUE democracy. Wars are caused by oligarchy, where rich old men saying \u201clet\u2019s you and him fight, to get me more money.\u201d Because most people value their own ass too much to fight a war for personal loss or gain; which is why oligarchs invent this \u201cduty, honor and country\u201d shit. Like in the Selective Draft Law Cases, the nine wretched rich old fartson the Supreme Court, rationalized combat-slavery with the following claptrap: Compelled military service is neither repugnant to a free government nor in conflict with the constitutional guaranties of individual liberty. Indeed, it may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the duty of the citizen to render military service in case of need, and the right of the government to compel it. Exept, that liberty is held to be endowed every person by their CREATOR\u2014 not the Constitution, which did not create them, and so cannot grant or deny it. Rather, the post-Lincoln regime simply created a quasi-theocratic dictatorship regarding the granting of all rights; and thus omnipotent discretion in destroying them. This was inevitable, once the Lincoln GOP destroyed true democracy, leaving only fake democracy in its place; while transferring final authority from the actual voters in each separate nation-state, to the 545 oligarchs in federal office. Ending with the Supreme Court. Thus, as James Madison warned in the 1800 Report on the Virginia Resolutions: \u2026in the term \"states\" \u2026 means the people composing those political societies, in their highest sovereign capacity\u2026. because in that sense the Constitution was submitted to the \"states;\" in that sense the \"states\" ratified it; and in that sense of the term \"states,\" they are consequently parties to the compact from which the powers of the federal government result\u2026. The states, then, being the parties to the constitutional compact, and in their sovereign capacity, it follows of necessity that there can be no tribunal, above their authority, to decide, in the last resort, whether the compact made by them be violated; and consequently, that, as the parties to it, they must themselves decide, in the last resort, such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition\u2026. However true, therefore, it may be, that the judicial department is, in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort must necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the authorities of the other departments of the government; not in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact, from which the judicial, as well as the other departments, hold their delegated trusts. On any other hypothesis, the delegation of judicial power would annul the authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this department with the others in usurped powers, might subvert forever, and beyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy, the very Constitution which all were instituted to preserve. These works simply observe the fact that each state was declared a separate nation-state unto itself in 1776; and did not surrender that status via the Constitution in 1787-9: but on the contrary, final authority was secured by it to the individual citizen voters of each state, vs. each state\u2019s delegates as under the prior Articles of Confederation. Accordingly, the USA has existed as a criminal empire in which all citizens live as slaves to the corrupt Leviathan state. ",
