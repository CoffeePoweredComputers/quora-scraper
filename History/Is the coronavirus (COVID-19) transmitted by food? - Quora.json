            "answer_text": "SARS-Cov-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) binds to the ACE2 receptors which, in addition to existing on cells throughout the respiratory system, exists on cells lining the gut (and circulatory system).After the pandemic got rolling, doctors reviewed records and found that many patients diagnosed with COVID-19 had originally sought medical treatment for digestive system complaints.From these two points alone, it\u2019s baffling how anyone can say \u201cwe have no evidence to suggest the transmission of COVID-19 via food.\u201d We do. These observations are direct evidence suggesting transmission via food. Now, having said that, \u201csuggest\u201d does not mean \u201cprove.\u201d Viruses are pretty feeble, and the things we eat are exactly the sorts of things that chemically, should bind to and quickly destroy virus particles. So while we have evidence suggesting transmission via food, we have evidence suggesting that\u2019s unlikely. But \u201cunlikely\u201d does not mean impossible. Washing or otherwise sanitizing your food makes sense, especially if you are at particular risk. But at the same time, you should not injure or poison yourself in the process, and should consider that with the risk of contamination through food being logically very low, and the fact that the odds of your innate immunity handling trivial amounts of virus or weakened virus with no problem, this is not something you should be loosing sleep over. That said, I routinely wash, repackage, or irradiate with UV-C light all items entering my home, and have done since the middle of March.

            "answer_text": "Hmm I would most definitely thinks so, SARS-coV-2 have a larger viral load and 35% of the time entering directly to your nuclear area or glands, this is their final destination, this is where the Y- RNA enters your cells without difficulty and symptoms would be almost with 24\u201372hrs and can only be detected by a PCR test, if you think you have been exposed research the latest prophylaxis treatment in your country and try rather to cook everything well esspecialy fish if there is an outbreak on the coastline. I have 5 candidates at the moment that all have not contacted and have been on the front line daily, by taking The L-Amimo acids,.i have studied 2 that support my study, effectively the one is L-Glutamine and L-Lysine and a few others these protect cells by boosting the protein layer making it impenetrable and Glutamine plays a major role in digest and produce healthy cell reproduction, this has not been proven but used in many hospitals in the recent week I started my course of AminoGrow a month ago You must however practice 3 more things; Masks preferably with a filter if you can't get a filtered mask, then get a cotton washable mask,( you can clean it daily with new gloves and alcohol pads only so you ideally don't make it to wet, when u do this do each side evenly and hold it only on elastic side which you will clean last, then itake a glass of water fill it up 85% them after inserting in microwave for 50sec revome gloves and clean hands with no 70% based gel or liquid and sterilization should be completed. Then hang up in a protected high place or sterilized plastic bag sealed as airtight as possible and store in cupboard alone, only open again after washing hands and.glovea and put mask on and so not tpuh the front of your mask nor try to touch it if you use my method with good hygiene bleach everything that you touch, doorhandle buttons or anything you may touch, shoes can pick up contaminated cov-2 and spread it on your floors, so either leave your shoes at the entrance or bleach the sole Everytime you go out with gloves or wash your hands with surgical soap and wait to dry.Try not to go out in windy conditions and light rains as continuation could have come.deom a building wall from someone spitting or sneezing and the drops may enter your eyes, so sunglasses on a rainy day is a good idea. I tracked the spread of a few countries that showed the more wind the bigger the outbreak the rain theory min still not convinced.Do all of these things and keep to a strict procedure till we find a reliable vaccine as treatment I for covid-19 would be retroviral drugs made for abola and both type 1 and 2 Hiv. These could save you as it will slow down the spread and give your immune system to identify it's pathogen and then radicate them, this can take from 3\u20136weeks in severe symptoms, mild symptoms, stay at home and isolate yourself for 3 weeks and get tested by PCR only as some patients have left after rapid tests show a negative and then respawns with full force , most cases result in death.Be heathy any practice hygiene, masks, Amino acids and bleach your floor counterb, bathroom do not ingest or inject, if u ingest call the poison control association in you lr country or ambulance and try to expell by vomiting. Good luck guys. ",
