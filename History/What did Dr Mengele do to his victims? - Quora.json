            "answer_text": "There were 3 main roles that Mengele performed at Auschwitz: When trains filled with men, women, children, babies, elderly etc arrived at the camp, he made a selection that designated the 90% who would die immediately versus the 10% who would be worked/starved to death. This can be termed the primary selection.He performed hideous medical experiment both on adults, children and babies. Many of these victims were twins. The details of the experiments were too horrible for me to go into detail about.Once many prisoners were working hard on just starvation rations, he would do periodic selections of these workers. Anyone who looked sick, weak, apathetic, etc was sent to the gas chambers. This can be termed secondary selection.",
