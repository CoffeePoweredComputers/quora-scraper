            "answer_text": "The idea of certain natural inalienable rights.[1] We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed This is an idea that is propagated throughout the texts of different Enlightenment period writers. We have Paine\u2019s Common Sense and Rights of Man, among others; but we also have mottos and manifestos. I think everyone\u2019s heard that well-used French tripartite: Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9. Interestingly, it was first used in a speech given by Maximillien \u201cthat man now famous for liberal use of the guillotine\u201d Robespierre. From On the Organization of the National Guard[2] : Discours sur l'organisation des gardes nationalesArticle XVI.On their uniforms engraved these words: FRENCH PEOPLE, & below: LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY. The same words are inscribed on flags which bear the three colors of the nation.(French: XVI. Elles porteront sur leur poitrine ces mots grav\u00e9s : LE PEUPLE FRAN\u00c7AIS, & au-dessous : LIBERT\u00c9, \u00c9GALIT\u00c9, FRATERNIT\u00c9. Les m\u00eames mots seront inscrits sur leurs drapeaux, qui porteront les trois couleurs de la nation.) Locke believed those natural rights to be the right to life, liberty, and to property. What constitutes inalienable rights is clearly a matter where people differed. In fact, many of the period\u2019s writers only believed these to apply to white, land-owning men. However, this idea that there are things that all human beings are entitled to is the basis for all civil rights movements since. The world we live in is not quite perfect; but the ground we\u2019ve made in the fight for these rights is astounding, and I believe the world to be better than ever. But we\u2019re not done yet. The human race should set forth to do the best for its progeny, to make their world even better than ours. The idea that people should naturally be entitled to certain rights are the foundation for how I engage with people. My default nature is to treat everybody with empathy, kindness, and respect, because those mannerisms - among other things - should naturally be given and received between the entirety of humanity. Inalienable rights affects the daily proceedings of life itself. This has had the biggest impact of any Enlightenment idea on my life.
