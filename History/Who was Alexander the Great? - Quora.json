            "answer_text": "Alexander the Great (warning, this is kind of weird) So once upon a time in 356 BCE, there was a baby that was born. His dad was the king of Macedon, so he was the little baby prince. Aww, how cute. So they name him Alexander. But he was the third Alexander. So he was officially Alexander III. So this kid grows up. As I\u2019m sure you all know, kids need to get an education. So guess who he got as his private tutor? Aristotle!! Lucky duck\u2026 So anyway. Aristotle tells him something along the lines of \u201cmoderation is key\u201d. Remember this. Moderation is good. Alexander keeps growing up. And eventually, at age 20, he was crowned king of Macedonia. He marries a lady named Roxana from Bactria. Go Alexander\u2026 Now, Alexander over here has some beef with the Persians. Because, about 100 or so years ago- 109 I think (don\u2019t quote me on that) the Persians had destroyed the Acropolis. So Alexander knows he\u2019s a smart guy. He decides to take over the Persian Empire! At this time, a guy named Darius is ruling the Persian Empire. Alexander goes to Issus. There he met Darius, and they fought at the Battle of Issus.  Battle of Issus - Wikipedia Basically, Alexander conquers Persia and expands his empire. His success makes him really cocky. Really, really cocky. Okay, maybe \u201ccocky\u201d was not the word I should have used. Because\u2026 I think it\u2019s self-explanatory. Let\u2019s say \u201carrogant\u201d. His success made him arrogant. He started to drink a lot. That totally trashed his liver. On top of that, he always went in to battle. (Which was a really stupid idea because if he was killed then what would happen?) From that, he got a lot of battle wounds. Anyway, he died while his wife was pregnant. His kid was a baby, so he couldn\u2019t rule- he needed a regent. Plus, Alexander had a half-brother named Philip. (By the way, the kid was named Alexander IV. Personally, I think they should have come up with a new name. Alexander is getting kind of boring. For the sake of this answer I will call him Little Alex.) Philip wanted to be king, but all the hotshots said no. They all had personal rivalries with each other, so they ended up arguing over this. Alexander must have been too busy expanding to notice that all his generals hated each other. Things weren't the best at other places in his empire either, but expansion, expansion, expansion, right?? So they split up the empire into chunks and gave different people different chunks to rule. That failed miserably. In the end, Philip became king. Little Alex was murdered at around 13 to prevent him from becoming powerful. TL;DR Alexander was a Macedonian king who took over the Persian Empire. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question asking about a man who was considered to be a demigod in his lifetime by his own people and by the bystanders who were fortunate enough to see him and his actions which defined ancient Greece and the Hellenic civilization in general. Alexander was the son of Philip II of Macedon,the king of Macedonia and he inherited the throne of Macedonia at twenty years old when his father died. He then led a series of conquests which stretched the Greek empire from the Macedonia to Egypt,and Persia to north-west India. In a decade he had managed to conquer most of the known world and have the longest stretching empire until that time. Alexander was called the Great and rightfully so,as he built monuments and twenty cities named after him,such as the one called Alexandria in Egypt which is still standing. He helped to spread Greek culture and influence to Asia,Africa and everywhere in between he went. He was the first western leader to come in close contact with Hinduism and Buddhism present in the Indian subcontinent at that time. He brought his Greek ideas and philosophy to India in return. Alexander is even said to have made the king Porus,and Indian maharaja,one of his regional commanders for the Punjab province which he conquered.  ",
