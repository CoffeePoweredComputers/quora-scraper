            "answer_text": "It\u2019s debatable. As definitive proof of when cities sprang up and what you call a city is all a matter of opinion. Do you call any major village a settlement? then we coulnd\u2019t possibly know what really is the oldest city in Europe. But if you go back and look what city had been continiouly inhabited, that we know of; it\u2019s either Plovdiv in Bulgaria or Argos in Greece. As a previous awnser stated, Plovdiv has remains of inhabitants 6000 years back. However, Argos had a better documented history , beginning somewhere in the first millenium BC. That history goes back 7000 years, arguably making it the oldest city in Europe. However, both Plovdiv and Argos had been cycling between city and village for centuries. If you take a more strict understanding of a city, as in having walls or a significant number of inhabitants, then you get other contenders, like Athens, whose history indicates it was a fully fledged city some 3400 years ago, around 1400 BC. A status it hasn\u2019t really lost since then. If you also count in cities that weren\u2019t continiously inhabited, Knossos also comes to mind, but that city hasn\u2019t been inhabited since 1200 BC\u2026 I hope this gives a good idea of what could be the oldest city in Europe, and why multiple cities could call themselves \u2018the oldest city in Europe\u2019.
