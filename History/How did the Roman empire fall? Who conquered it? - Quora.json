            "answer_text": "This guy:  Mehmed II the Conqueror in 29 May 1453. The process towards the decline and fall of the Roman Empire was gradual. The Western part of the Empire collapsed due to a combination of incompetent Emperors, internal strife and barbarian invasions. The East survived almost a thousand years more but eventually collapsed due to similar reasons.  Above is a map of the Roman Empire during its height of power. Looks impressive, right? Thing is, after the death of Marcus Aurelius, things began going downhill. A series of incompetent Emperors followed until 235, when Maximinus Thrax became Emperor. He was of low birth, a soldier and seen by the Senate as a \u2018barbarian\u2019. Yet, because he had the backing of the army, he was able to secure power for himself. This set off what became the \u2018Military Anarchy\u2019 or \u2018Crisis of the Third Century\u2019 (235 - 284), when military commanders became Emperors thanks to force of arms only to be overthrown/assassinated shortly thereafter. The crisis, combined with barbarians invasions of Germanic tribes across the Rhine and Danube, as well as the rise of a new powerful Persian Empire, the Sassanid Dynasty, caused the Empire to fragment. Gaul and Palmyra (in the East) became independent regimes and the Empire was essentially divided into three Kingdoms. Aureliean managed to reunify the Empire. He claimed the title Restitutor Orbis or 'Restorer of the World'. His reign did not last long however. As expected, this military anarchy weakened the Empire considerably.  All this changed thanks to Diocletian (the guy above). He took control of the Empire in 284. He expanded the bureaucracy of the Empire, enlarged its civil and military services, centralized it, claimed supreme authority (Dominate), ruling more like a Persian Emperor than a Roman one, and most importantly of all he divided the Empire into East and West. He understood that the Empire was too large to be administrated by only one man. Each part was led by an \u2018Augustus\u2019 while a subordinate named \u2018Caesar\u2019 aided the \u2018Augustus\u2019 and served as a heir. That system became known as the \u2018Tetrarchy\u2019 (Rule of Four). While it did not survive after the abdication of Diocletian, the division between East and West proved to be permanent. Constantine I (the Great) in 324 reunified the Empire and constructed a new imperial capital on the site of the ancient Byzantium; he named it Constantinople. The center of the Empire thus moved to the East. The Empire was divided for the last time in 395, when Theodosius the Great died and left the East to his son Arkadios and the West to his other son Honorius.  The East was dominated by civil officials, the princesses and eunuchs. The West was dominated by military officers. Surprisingly as it may sound, this worked well of the East and bad for the West. In the West, the military officers subverted the power of the Emperor while many of them were of barbarian origins. On the other hand, the civil officials, princesses and eunuchs were mostly Roman and, as they depended on the office of the Emperor, were less likely to subvert it. The East was also richer, more urbanized and many important trade routes passed through its lands. The West was less rich and had less resources to muster. On the other hand, while the West faced only Germanic barbarians, the East faced both Germanic barbarians and the Sassanid Dynasty (AKA Persians) who were a rich and great Empire in their own right. What saved the East was better diplomacy as well as luck; using their wealth, the Eastern Emperors could buy off the barbarians and persuade them to attack the West instead. They were also lucky as the Persians too faced barbarian invasions and so were willing to make peace with the Eastern Romans. The Western Romans were less lucky; their provinces flooded with barbarians and their Emperors were incompetent. Not only that, but they assassinated their most capable military officers: both Stilicho and Aetius, capable military men who had defended the Western Empire, were murdered by order of the Court. Thus in 476, the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed by a barbarian general.  This was not the end of the Empire. As I\u2019ve noted in another answer of mine, the Romans did not see the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire as two different Empires in the way many modern people do. They considered them to be one Empire with two courts and Emperors. After all, the Empire had been ruled by more than one Emperor before (Tetrarchy). Until the fall of the WRE, there were still two Consuls, one from the West and one from the East, and laws issued in one part of the Empire took effect in the other part too. After the fall of the West to the barbarians, the Romans (or Byzantines, as modern historians call them) made an effort to restore their control over their lost Western provinces. Emperor Justinian (527 - 565) reconquered Italy, North Africa and Southern Spain for the Empire. Yet, despite his successes, his successors proved less capable in defending the Empire. Lombards soon invaded and took over a large part of Italy. Berber tribes raided North Africa. The Persians took over Syria, Palestine and Egypt. Although Emperor Heraclius beat them, the Arabs in the 630\u2019s and 640\u2019s took over Syria, Palestine and Egypt and until 717 they had managed to conquer most of Armenia and all of North Africa. The reasons for this sudden collapse are still debated; although there were religious differences between Monophysites and Orthodox, modern research shows that the Egyptian and Syrian populations actually sided with the Empire and not with the Arabs as it was believed in the past. The wars of Justinian in the West are sometimes blamed, but modern historians argue that the Empire was not as depleted by the wars as it was believed and that North Africa and Sicily were prosperous provinces that made up for the expenses of holding the West. Possibly, the reason for the sudden collapse is a combination of incompetent leadership, civil strife and attack on all fronts that stretched thin the manpower of the Byzantines.  In 717, Leo III came to the throne of the Empire. His Isaurian Dynasty saved the Empire and set the stage for the recovery of the Empire. Because this question is about the fall of the Empire, I will describe only shortly the timeline between 717 and 1025: the Isaurian, Amorian and Macedonian Emperors proved to be capable administrators and excellent generals. They reconquered the Balkans, pushed back the Arabs in Syria and Mesopotamia and expanded their rule in Southern Italy. In 1025, when Basil II died, the Empire looked like this:  Why the Empire collapsed a few decades later? The Emperors proved to be incompetent, relying on the civil officials only and sidelining the military officers who had brought all those victories. The harsh measures of Basil II against the Anatolian aristocracy, who provided the generals that defended the East, also played a role in the decline of the Byzantine military. The Empire began relying on mercenaries. The Turks, a nomadic people, were able to use the civil strife between civil and military officials and their mobility to defeat the Byzantines. The defeat of the Empire in the Battle of Manzikert (1071) allowed the Turks to overtake most of Anatolia. The Komnenoi Emperors managed to to push back the Turks with the aid of the crusaders. Although they did not manage to push the Turks out of all of Anatolia, they secured the wealthy coastal areas; the Turks were left with the barren highlands. The Balkans were also completely secure after the Komnenoi pushed back nomadic invaders from the north. Yet, those victories were short lived. In the 1190\u2019s, incompetent Emperors came on the throne. The wealth of Byzantium combined with the incompetency of the Emperors was enough to lure the Western crusaders to take over Constantinople in 1204. The Empire fragmented.  Three Greek states emerged: the Empire of Nicaea, the Despotate of Epirus and the Empire of Trebizond. Of them, the Empire of Nicaea in 1261 restored the Byzantine Empire by retaking Constantinople. For a century, it seemed that Byzantium could survive as a regional power in Greece. Yet incompetent Emperors and civil wars ruined the Empire once more. The 1341 - 1347 civil war was catastrophic and allowed the Serbians and Turks to intervene in the conflict and make gains. The treasury was depleted and many provinces were lost. The Empire was on the mercy of Italian merchant city states who demanded privileges for their merchants. Eventually, the Empire became smaller and smaller until it consisted only of the City; Constantinople. The last Roman Emperor was not Romulus Augustus and did not give up his throne. The last Roman Emperor was Constantine XI. When the Ottomans besieged Constantinople in 1452, he fought bravely even though he knew that he could not win. In May 29, 1453 he charged at the enemies when they entered the city and died fighting as a simple soldier. That heroic last charge was a fitting end for an Empire that had lasted almost 1500 years.  The reasons the Empire fell: civil strife and civil wars, incompetent Emperors, attacks from all fronts by barbarians which stretched thin the resources of the Empire and bad luck. ",

Nevertheless the Roman Empire was a glorious and powerful empire and it was as large about 5,000,000 square miles across Eurasia, the Balkan region, The Middle East and some parts of Africa.  ",

They were ruthless in that they pillaged like mad and left a path of destruction behind them.  Pictured is the Visigoths invading Rome, the first of three Germanic tribes to devastate Rome in an invasion.  No single group of people conquered the Roman Empire. It was a number of different Germanic tribes who each went to different parts of the Empire, successfully invaded and then settled themselves. ",
