            "answer_text": "Yes absolutely! The richest Man In Babylon by George S.Clason is an introductory books about personal finance. Since this book is only 150 pages I decide to finish it in a single 2 hour long reading. This book is not the ultimate personal finance book, there are other books out there but it can really help you to have the right mindset about money. This book has a very simple message-Everyone has the right to be wealthy. These 15 lessons are so good that I have decided to read them every morning as daily affirmations. My 15 lessons from The Richest Man In Babylon are- Financial Freedom can only be achieved if your earned wealth is greater than spent wealth.To become rich you must be ready to claim your share of the good things in life.To become rich you must not be one of those people who stand far away ,enviously watching others enjoy.If you want to become rich , the first thing you must do is to stop buying cheap things that look less respectable.To become rich you must promise yourself that you will not be satisfied with the life of a poor man.Before starting your journey towards financial freedom you must open your life to the worlds most finest things.The basic rule of money:All you have earned is yours to keep.Everything you earn must be saved , your savings must also earn and the saving from that must also earn.Always take financial advice from someone who handels huge sums of money everyday.Calculate your expenses everyday and control it.Always set aside emergency /retirement savings.Make a list of all your necessary daily expenses and monthly expenses . Remove the other expenditures , think of them as the multitude of desires that must go unsatisfied and do not regret.The 5 laws of gold-(directly from the book)The First Law of Gold. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family.The Second Law of Gold. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.The Third Law of Gold. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.The Fourth Law of Gold. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.The Fifth Law of Gold. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.14.Don't loan money to someone who can't return it back . Ask for advice in such cases. 15.You need to have a constant earning capacity in order to attain wealth. Hope you liked my answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Totally. Written in 1926, the book \"The Richest Man In Babylon\" by George Samuel Clason is still relevant today.  Most of the books on personal finance that have been written since then have taken up the great ideas set out in that book. The first essential idea that is still relevant today is this one: Rich people are rich because they save their money, do not go into debt and do not spend their money foolishly. The second essential idea is the implementation of this principle. George Samuel Clason advises you to pay yourself first by saving at least 10% of your income. This way of thinking has since been repeated in many books on wealth and personal finance. Paying you first means not spending your money on useless things you don\u2019t need. Those who fall into this trap make the choice to serve last. And often there is not much left to spare at that point. ",
