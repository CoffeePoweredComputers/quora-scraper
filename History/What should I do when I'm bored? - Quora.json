            "answer_text": "Ahhh yes, if anybody has tried to master this question, it's me. Well a definite boredom killer is playing video games. Video games, computer games, mobile games. Basically any game. You can even throw board games and card games and other types of traditional games in there. I think games were created specifically to do away with boredom, obviously. I am a huge fan of all kinds of games. Next, try picking up a good book. Reading can kill hours upon hours upon hours of time. Reading is a very constructive activity that sharpens your imagination and your mind. You will learn so much through books. Read widely and read deeply as high school SAT counselors advise students. Explore new hobbies. There are a plethora of hobbies, many creative ones, that you can pick up and really indulge in. Maybe you would love to learn how to dance, or play an instrument. Or you can take up scrapbooking, jewelry making, flower arranging. Who knows, with practice and talent, you might even turn said hobby into income! In any case, it will expand your world and offer you excitement and stimulation. In constrast to creative hobbies, one can also explore scientific and technical hobbies. Maybe, your city has a local science museum where you can find activities and programs. Try networking and making new friends. Expand your social network and host a party at your home. Parties and social events are always exciting events to look forward to. Get involved. Find organizations in your locality where you can become an active member. Maybe it is a cultural, political, or volunteer organization. You can dedicate your time and energy there. Plus, such involvements look great on a resume, especially if you take on leadership roles. Plan a trip or travel destination. Travelling is always an exciting and enriching experience. You will have some goal to save up for. And planning a dream vacation beforehand with a full itinerary will get you feeling excited and adventurous. Plus, planning ahead means less hassle when it's time to go. These are some of my suggestions as to what one can do when bored. There are, most likely, a million more suggestions, but I obviously cannot list them all in this one post. ",

            "answer_text": "Stuck at home dealing with a bad case of the blahs? Before you let your lethargy get the best of you, remember that boredom is a choice, not a sentence. To prove my point, I put together some super easy (and mostly free-of-charge) things you can do when you find yourself overwhelmed with boredom. From styling your bookshelves to DIY facials, here are thirty ways to have fun the next time you're feeling bored.  (Image credit: Anna Spaller) Organize 1. Free up your phone space. What better time than now to clear out all the stuff taking up space on your phone? Use your downtime to score some extra GBs by deleting old photos, apps you don't use, and old messages. 2. Style your bookshelf. Whether you prefer your bookshelves color-coded or stacked gallery-style, organizing your books is a great way to kill time and freshen up your bookshelf. 3. Organize your closet. If you're anything like me \u2014 aka dealing with a tiny overstuffed closet \u2014 your wardrobe is likely long overdue for a clean out. Now's your chance to finally clear out your closet and hopefully score some extra storage space. 4. Upgrade your bathroom storage situation. Looking for a new place to store an awkward dresser? There are tons of unexpected bathroom furniture pieces that offer ample bathroom storage opportunities \u2014 and now's the time to move some stuff around! 5. Clear out your refrigerator. No matter how much of a clean freak you might be, chances are you have at least one expired item sitting in your refrigerator. Take this free time to clear out your fridge and organize your freezer while you're at it, too. 6. Declutter your place. Why stop at your closet or fridge when you can de-clutter your whole stinkin' place? Take this time to downsize your stuff and make a charitable drop-offwhen you're done.  (Image credit: Shay Spaniola) Clean 7. Deep clean your bathroom. Searching for a productive way to kill a good hour? Give your bathroom a good old-fashioned deep cleaning and you won't have to worry about it being dirty when your schedule picks up again. 8. Or your kitchen. Name one thing more satisfying\u2014and fun to look at\u2014than a sparkly clean kitchen? We won't hold our breath. 9. Or your whole friggin' house. Feeling the buzz of your freshly cleaned bathroom or kitchen? Ride the cleaning wave and keep on tidying up (at least until you think of something better to do). 10. Soften a cheap pair of sheets with vinegar. Too tired to deep clean your place but still searching for something productive to do. Throw your cheap pair of spare sheets in the washer with a cup of baking soda and \u00bd a cup of vinegar and brace yourself for a good night's sleep. 11. Clean your makeup brushes. Got ten minutes and a couple of hair ties? Rid your dirty makeup brushes of oil buildup and bacteria and give them a thorough upside-down cleaning. 12. Pull out your clothes steamer. You can tackle everything from carpet stains to dirty tile grout in just a matter of minutes with your trusty garment steamer (even travel-sized versions will do).  (Image credit: Minette Hand) Create 13. Make a mood board. Turn your boredom into inspiration and fashion a mood board for your bedroom or home office. 14. Make your own woven rug. Foreseeing a weekend at home? Stop by the fabric store on Friday and by Sunday, you'll have a one-of-a-kind hand-woven rug. 15. Dress up your furniture. Feeling bored but ambitious? Pull out your paintbrush and make a fun stencil, and before you know it, you'll have your very own bone-inay-inspired dresser. 16. Dye your stuff. Looking for a fun way to update your bedding? Grab a pack of fabric dye from the store (it's under five bucks) and tie-dye your sheets and pillowcases. 17. Refinish your furniture. Bored but don't have the budget to go shopping for new furniture? Refinish your furniture's battered wooden legs with metallic contact paper for a revamped look. 18. Repurpose old paper bags. Who knew paper grocery bags had so much design potential? From storage bins to plant holders, you can use your down time to upcycle all those paper bags you've been hoarding.  (Image credit: Minette Hand) Decorate 19. Design a gallery wall. What better time than when you're bored to finally fashion a fabulous gallery wall for your living room? 20. Upcycle old candle jars. Before you throw out your depleted candle jars, consider saving them to repurpose the next time you're bored with nothing to do. 21. Rearrange your living room. Searching for a cheap way to update your whole apartment. Rearrange your living room for a fresh new look that's totally free of charge. 22. Forge an entryway. Dreaming of a proper entryway but stuck with a narrow hall instead? Use your free time to forge a mini-foyer for your apartment with a few coat hooks or a diy dowel coat rack. 23. Refresh your kitchen. Update your kitchen on the cheapby simply hanging up some art or removing your cabinet doors for open shelving.  (Image credit: Esteban Cortez) Play 24. Have friends over. Stuck at home broke with nothing to do? Call your friends over and play a party game with stuff around the house. 25. Phone a friend. Don't feel like company? No worries. Now's your chance to Facetime a friend and catch up without having to switch out of your sweatpants. 26. Determine your decor personality. Feeling especially bored but antisocial? Take our online decor personality quizto figure out your decorating style. 27. Exercise. Boredom doesn't have to turn into laziness. Use your free time to jumpstart your fitness goals with a fun in-home workout routine.  (Image credit: Marisa Vitale) Indulge 28. Sign up for some home catalogs. Home catalogs are ripe with decor inspiration. Sign up for a few of the best home decor catalogs now and you'll have them on hand for the time you feel bored. 29. Bake something delicious. What better time than being bored to channel your inner Julia Child? Treat yourself to something simple but delicious that you baked yourself (no worries if you don't want to share with your roomies). 30. Give yourself a DIY facial. Turn your down time into a spa-day with a DIY facial you can make from stuff you probably already have at home. source: 30 (Mostly Free) Things to Do When You\u2019re Bored ",

            "answer_text": "Here are a couple of ideas. Each one of them takes some dedication, so you I hope you\u2019re REALLY bored, and not just lazy.  Learn another language: Go unto Duolingo, or attend a community college class. You don\u2019t even have to pay for it, just walk on in and crash the course. You\u2019ll receive no university credit for it, but that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here, right? I\u2019d also recommend getting phrasebooks and finding other people who speak the language fluently. You\u2019ll need the practice. Try your local Starbucks. You hang out there long enough, and you might be surprised by how many languages you end up hearing. Learn to ride a unicycle: This will take about a week to learn, plus ~$130 for a good unicycle. I dunno, though. People are often trying to get rid of the stuff. I mean, who rides unicycles, anyways? Keep on practicing, and soon you\u2019ll have an obnoxious form of transportation for all occasions. Learn how to solve a Rubik\u2019s cube: These things are everywhere. Steal one from your sibling or claim that it was yours at a lost and found somewhere. Find an online video tutorial for solving. Get some scrap paper for writing down and memorizing algorithms. If you\u2019re REALLY bored, you\u2019ll have learned to solve it by the end of the day. Learn some calculus: Despite how intimidating it might sound, the basics of calculus really aren\u2019t all that difficult. So long as you have a good understanding of algebra (trigonometry can help too, but it\u2019s not entirely mandatory to get started with) you\u2019ll do fine. Get your hands on an introductory textbook, find a decent tutor from the aforementioned community college you\u2019re freeloading off of, and give it a go. You\u2019ll also be relying heavily on Desmos graphing calculator and Wolfram|Alpha. Go to a community service event: Be it providing for a homeless shelter, a soup kitchen, a marathon, or a clothes drive, it\u2019s a decent way to spend the afternoon/evening, while receiving community service forms that you can either staple to a job application or an incarceration form to hand to your employer/probation officer. (Is there really a difference when you get down to it? IDK) Plus, you feel smugly morally superior by the time you\u2019re done with it. Learn how to juggle: Juggling\u2019s one of those ridiculously simple things that takes a great deal of practice. I learned how to juggle by using some balled up socks. Whatever you do, don\u2019t use tennis balls. Those just make it extraordinarily frustrating whenever they bounce off of the palm of your hand and roll under the couch. Give it a few days.Juggle Rubik\u2019s cubes while riding a unicycle: I\u2019m not quite sure what you\u2019d be hoping to accomplish with this one, but hey, you SAID you were bored, didn\u2019t you?",

Shouldn't it be called double V?  5. Maybe oxygen is slowly killing you and It just takes 75-100 years to fully work.  6. Every time you clean something, you just make something else dirty.  7. The word \"swims\" upside-down is still \"swims\"  8. 100 years ago everyone owned a horse and only the rich had cars. Today everyone has cars and only the rich own horses.  9. If you replace \"W\" with \"T\" in \"What, Where and When\", you get the answer to each of them.  Six great confusions still unresolved  1. At a movie theatre, which arm rest is yours? 2. If people evolve from monkeys, why are monkeys still around? 3. Why is there a 'D' in fridge, but not in refrigerator? 4. Who knew what time it was when the first clock was made? And now sixer .... Vagaries of English Language! Enjoy!!! - Wonder why the word funeral starts with FUN? -Why isn't a Fireman called a Water-man? - How come Lipstick doesn't do what it says? - If money doesn't grow on trees, how come Banks have Branches? - If a Vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a Humanitarian eat? - How do you get off a non-stop Flight? - Why are goods sent by ship called CARGO and those sent by truck SHIPMENT? - Why do we put cups in the dishwasher and the dishes in the Cupboard? - Why do doctors 'practice' medicine? Are they having practice at the cost of the patients? - Why is it called 'Rush Hour' when traffic moves at its slowest then? - How come Noses run and Feet smell? - Why do they call it a TV 'set' when there is only one? - What are you vacating when you go on a vacation? We can never find the answers, can we? So just enjoy the pun and fun of the English language!! ",

Maybe it\u2019s your: Career: your job/study doesn\u2019t inspire you anymore, and you wonder if there is something better out there.Relationship: you are feeling numb in your marriage/relationship and wish you could feel deeply in love againHome: you are tired of where you live and long for somewhere with a different energy to it.Now something different have to do\u2026\u2026. 1. Channel your seven-year-old self. What would you want to do right now? Color? Paint? Run around outside? Play dress up? Eat with your hands? Play that instrument hiding in the back of your closet that you haven\u2019t touched in years? Just because you\u2019re a grown up doesn\u2019t mean any of this stuff will be less enjoyable than you remember it. Give yourself permission to play.  2. Speaking of little kids, if you have your own or access to any (in a non-creepy way, like they\u2019re your niece or your best friend\u2019s kid, you get the idea) go play with them! They also keep things so simple, and we can really stand to be reminded of this and stop allowing ourselves to get bogged down in boring details.  3. Order a hot dog. While you\u2019re eating it, Google: \u201cWhat\u2019s in a hot dog?\u201d You decide whether or not you want to finish it.  4. This one is for the ladies: wear your sexiest lingerie under your work clothes. Your \u201clittle secret\u201d will leave you feeling anything but boring all day!  5. Play cell phone roulette. You\u2019ll need at least one buddy for this. Scroll through the contacts in your phone, stop on a random one and call the person. Could spark an incredible catch up session. Could be incredibly awkward. Neither are boring.  6. Fill out a pack of Thank-You cards. Give them to random people who probably don\u2019t get thanked too often for doing what they do ever day. Ideas: police officers, librarians, servers, baristas, cab drivers, sanitation workers, teachers, people behind any check out counter, receptionists, your friends, the guy at the falafel stand, etc. 7. Sign up for a class in something you\u2019ve \u201calways wanted to do\u201d, or something that makes you really uncomfortable. Ideas: pole dancing, salsa lessons, cooking, knitting (yup, there are classes for this, too!), karate, boxing, something techy like the workshops they run in stores, learn language you\u2019ve always wanted to speak, etc.   8. Interview your grandparents about their life. You can bet they\u2019ve had some crazy experiences you probably never knew about. 9. Get up on stage at an open mic night whether you\u2019re funny or not (and if you\u2019re not, memorize a few of your favorite jokes and tell those!) 10. Do something for someone else that you wish someone would do for you. We all have a few ideas on this list. I promise you will feel amazing after and anything but bored. 11. Plan a weekend trip or an all-out vacation. This will give you something to look forward to.  12. People watch. Find a bench in a crowded area (centers of transportation like airports, bus stops and train stations are great for this!) and just observe. People are infinitely interesting.  13. Eat something you\u2019ve never eaten before. It totally depends on you 14. Dance. You can get your friends together for a night on the town or just pull up a video on YouTube and bust a move from your own living room. If you\u2019re feeling extra brave, you can even dance in public.  15. Step away from the computer and go get some time with people you care about IRL. (That stands for In Real Life). Facebook stalking doesn\u2019t count as real social interaction. If this is not working then dont worry try to make your own list. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of these answers are filled with ideas and similar suggestions if you google this question: read a book, learn a new language, discover a new hobby, etc. And those, of course, are all great suggestions. I\u2019m not knocking them. So hopefully no one takes it that way. As someone who had suffered an unshakable sense of boredom for decades (and this is no exaggeration \u2026 thank you, depression, for that one), I found most of these suggestions given just left me feeling empty and still bored. I tried for years to conquer boredom, to no avail. Reading a book? Bored. Play guitar? Bored. Go to a class to learn something (salsa, knitting, etc)? Bored. Took two years of German and private lessons \u2026 still bored. Biked for hours \u2026 still bored. Went to the gym daily \u2026 bored. (I\u2019m a lifelong athlete and runner and running is the one thing that I love\u2026but I was out of running commission for awhile. So while I work out daily \u2026 I really only love running and team sports.) Little worked for me except for the following, so I\u2019m suggesting this only if you are suffering from a boredom that seems to stick around, and you have a budget to work with (or are a responsible credit card owner and can pay off monthly statements in exchange for exhilaration and in return you will get some nice travel perks or other points): Buy a scooter. < \u2014 Game changer; preferably one you need a motorcycle license for. (They go faster.) Hell, buy a motorcycle instead, if you want. I bought a sweet scooter that went up to 70 mph and that thing made me feel alive every single time I rode it. It cost $2000. Cost of gas for the tank? Between $1\u2013$2, premium gas, to fill my tank and it lasted for at least 50 miles. It was my best purchase ever.Buy a plane ticket to some place you\u2019ve always wanted to go. Find a cheap one and you can easily find cheap accommodations through a number of sites. Sticking yourself into a new culture can shake things up. Seeing new sites can shake things up. Getting lost in a new city is fantastic. Even if you literally get lost.Just pack up and move, if you don\u2019t have some major responsibility tying you down. That\u2019s what I did. I woke up every day hating where I lived (my hometown), feeling empty and completely uninspired. I looked around at my surroundings for years and thought \u201cWhy am I in this place?\u201d. So, I decided to apply to grad school in Stockholm, Sweden because I love the city. I applied to one school. Got in. Sold everything. And moved abroad. And while nothing has gone smooth here in any way in the two years I\u2019ve lived here, that feeling of being bored has completely vanished. I still struggle with depression but that perpetual boredom \u2026 has lifted.",

Whether I was in the car, having a meal with my family, on vacation - it really didn\u2019t matter. I said I was \u201cbored.\u201d I remember so vividly this seemingly insignificant, but life-changing moment I was in the car with my parents and brothers when I repeated my favorite repetitive sentence when my dad stopped the car and turned to me and said, \u201cBoredom is a state of mind, not a fact. When you\u2019re bored, you ARE boredom. There\u2019s no such thing as a situation being boring. Saying you\u2019re bored is a sentence about your being, not the situation.\u201d I was 13 at the time. The wisdom hit me like a ton of bricks; for the first time I thought - \u201cwhat the hell does it even mean to BE bored?\u201d Like anything else in life, an adjective we use to describe a situation usually has NOTHING to do with the situation itself, but how we\u2019re relating to it. Saying \u201cthis is boring\u201d or I\u2019m bored\u201d simply means that we\u2019ve decided to relate to a circumstance as boring. It means that we haven\u2019t been able to find a relationship to this circumstance as interesting, fun, or enjoyable. This is going to seem a little harsh, but I don\u2019t intend it as an insult in any way. Sometimes we need a little bit of reality to change the way we\u2019re thinking about something. So - to answer your question of what you should do when you\u2019re bored - realize that boredom is a state of mind, and find a way to relate differently to your circumstance. If you\u2019re bored, you can always\u2026 do something that\u2019s not boring! Read a bookThink about something that interests youLearn something you don\u2019t knowDo some work you\u2019ll have to do laterListen to musicCall someone you missThank a friend or family member for something they did for you in the pastBe grateful that you\u2019re alive\u2026.. there\u2019s always something TO DO. If you can\u2019t find something to DO when you\u2019re feeling bored, then you need to question whether you have enough interest in life. ",

            "answer_text": "Humans are creatures of intellect. Boredom is a creation of your intellect. It\u2019s the revolt of your brain, which craves for knowledge. I can give you a list of activities you could do when bored. That would be giving you a fish. You\u2019d benefit a lot more from learning how to fish though. Think about the activities you\u2019re spending the most time on. When battling boredom, basically you can divide them in two major groups: activities stimulating your intellect, and activities not doing that. The first group contains things like writing, reading, painting, sports, learning, playing an instrument, having engaging and challenging conversations with smart and educated peers, doing creative and productive work on a project. They don\u2019t seem like fun to most people, generally because enjoying those activities requires a level of commitment and a learning curve that most people lack. You need to be familiar with a few general principles and practices, but then you\u2019re free to dive into the endless pools of engagement those activities can provide. The second group includes watching garbage TV and reality shows, playing video games and conversing with shallow-minded individuals or groups. They don\u2019t engage your mind to its full capacities. You gain little or nothing when participating. You grow tired of them quickly, and you try to replace them with other similar activities. The cycle is hard to leave. I know, I\u2019ve been there. The more you engage in stimulating activities, the faster time flies. You might get bored from them occasionally, but that\u2019s because you\u2019re physically tired from doing them for hours in a row without noticing almost the entire day has passed. Once you become a person fully aware and in touch with his intellectual needs, you\u2019ll never be bored again. ",

            "answer_text": "What is boredom anyway? You might not realize it, but boredom stimulates a form of anxiety & stress. It evokes an emotional state that creates frustration and feeds procrastination. It\u2019s a desire to be \u2018doing something\u2019 or to be \u2018entertained\u2019. It\u2019s a desire for sensory stimulation. What it boils down to a lack of focus. If you think about those times when you\u2019re bored it\u2019s usually because you \u2018don\u2019t know what to do\u2019. So indecision plays a big part. When we are focused on what\u2019s important to us and what we want to achieve, it\u2019s pretty hard to be bored. So one answer to boredom is to become focused on what you want. Sometimes it\u2019s good to be bored If boredom is a desire for sensory stimulation \u2013 then what\u2019s the opposite of that? To be content with no stimulation. In other words, to enjoy stillness. Research has shown that it\u2019s not the \u2018boredom\u2019 its-self that causes the frustration, it\u2019s the resistance to doing nothing. Think about it. What would happen if you were to \u2018let go\u2019 of the desire to be entertained? You wouldn\u2019t be bored anymore. You would be relaxing! In my experience, it\u2019s often the most obvious, simplistic solutions that are the most powerful in life. So when you\u2019re bored, the easiest way to combat this is to enjoy it. Sounds weird, but think of \u2018boredom\u2019 as a form of \u2018relaxation\u2019. It\u2019s a break from the constant stimulation that 21st century living provides. The constant TVs, mobile phones, radios, internet, emails, phonecalls\u2026 Who knows, maybe \u2018boredom\u2019 is actually a good for us? Next time you\u2019re \u2018feeling bored\u2019 instead of feeding the frustration by frantically looking for something to do, maybe you can sit back, relax and savor the feeling of having nothing to do. Here\u2019s my 3 step strategy to overcome boredom: 1. Get focused Instead of chasing sensory stimulation at random, focus on what\u2019s really important to you. What would make good use of your time? What could you be doing that would contribute to your major goals in life? Here are a few ideas: Spend some time in quiet contemplation considering what\u2019s important to youStart that creative project you\u2019ve been talking about for the last few weeksBrainstorm: think of some ideas for new innovative products or businesses2. Kill procrastination Boredom is useful in some ways because it give us energy to \u2018do things\u2019, so next time you\u2019re bored why not put this good energy to use by ticking off those things that you have been \u2018meaning to get done, but have been too busy\u2019. This is a great time to clear your \u2018to do\u2019 list. Some ideas: Do some exerciseRead a bookLearn something newCall a friendGet creative (draw, paint, sculpt, create music, write)Spring cleanWash the carRenovate the houseRe-arrange the furnitureWrite your shopping listWater the plantsWalk the dogSort out your mail & emailDe-clutter (clear out that wardrobe)3. Enjoy boredom If none of the above work, then try a different approach. Don\u2019t give in to boredom and instead choose to enjoy it. Contrary to popular belief, we don\u2019t need to be constantly \u2018doing things\u2019 in order to be productive. In-fact research has shown that people are more productive when they take periods of rest to recharge. So take some time to relax. You never know you might even like it. Source: Lifehack ",
