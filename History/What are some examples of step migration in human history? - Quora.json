            "answer_text": "How about human migration? The slow movement of people here, then there, then a little bit further. Take a look at the map of how certain peoples\u2019 human DNA has been mapped migrating over history:  The first step started on the West coast of Africa, then slowly migrated out of Africa, over to Europe and Middle East, then to Asia and beyond. The final step has us humans of today inhabiting, quite prosperously with large cities full of commerce and technology and sprawling suburbs full of homes and economies, every inch of the world\u2019s land masses. Quite a feat for a few homeless, nomadic guys in West Africa! ",

            "answer_text": "It is thought many Aryan tribes were kicked out of India for not respecting Cow and Brahman. India extends to Russia in North and Lanka in South and China in East and West to Caspian Sea and in fact includes Arabia. Arabs of ancient times were noble peoples expert at horse riding and some were devotees of Lord Shiva. Dr. Elst states Arabs are first victims of profit MohaMAD, crazy arab businessman. Mohamadanism exists due to xtianity. MahaBharat war (about 5000 + years ago) left severe shortage of girls. Genetic damage occurred. Unjust wars create ugliness. This war was at junction of two ages: Silver age and Iron Age - Mankind fell directly from Silver Age to Iron Age. Now we are at low point of Iron Age - proof is in ill-treatment of girls and cows. (source is book by Rajaram - Nostradamus and Beyond - Visions of Yuga Sandhi) We are living in dangerous times (jihadists etc.) Demon Chengiz Khan did a lot to destroy beauty - see youtube video entitled Death of Beauty: Central Asia.Excellent portrayal of history - accurate and fair video.Druids probably migrated from India. 16 million women murdered by xtianity due to hair colour - xtianity hates silky black, gold and red hair - yellow hair is acceptable - how did Indra supposedly get yello hair Answer: adultery.One thing is true: real party is at Hindu Heaven - svaraga loka - no visible or invisible minorities - good thing as visible minorities always ruin the party.Semitich creeds are demented. Man is Divine. Earth is beautiful. Crazed xtian preachers defile airwaves when they dare say \"creation is cursed\" - - only one cursed is one who finds fault with what AkalPurakh has created.Become liberated and visit Hinduism.co.za - why languages of India not listed?excuse typos ",
