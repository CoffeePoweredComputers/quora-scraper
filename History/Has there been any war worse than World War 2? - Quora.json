            "answer_text": "That answer largely depends on your point of view. In terms of (absolute) number of casualties or total number of active war participants the answer is clear: No. But e.g. measured by relative casualties (compared to total population) for a single country or by result for the loser, there are certainly cases worse than WW 2. Just 2 examples: The thirty years war in Europe (1618\u20131648) took a total toll of appr. one third of the whole German population by battle deaths, famine and deseases. The third Punic war between Rome and Carthago (149\u2013146 BC) costed Carthagos existence and led to slavery for all of Carhagos remaining population. Some of Dschinghis Khans or Tamerlans campaigns likewise included destruction of whole cities or principalities including death or/and slavery for their entire populations. Thus in a nutshell - if the whole earth populazion is your reference, WW2 so far was the worst war in mankinds history. If single regions are your reference, than their were wars far worse. ",
