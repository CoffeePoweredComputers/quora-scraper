            "answer_text": "First off, failing to invade a country twice was not that unusual, even for the Mongols. How many invasions did the Mongols had to make before Jin, Western Xia, Goryeo, and Song surrendered?Typhoons. This is the most popular and common belief. A lot of soldiers drown before they ever made it to the shores of Kyushu. However, what was even more disastrous than people drowning were the supply ships that were sunk. Logistics are crucial in an invasion, and without them, the entire battle would start to end badly. Mongol soldiers were trapped in Japan without supply ships due to the typhoon, so they could not receive any backup, food, or medicine. As a result, it was only a matter of time before the Mongol soldiers get wiped out by the Japanese samurais.The Japanese were an incredibly united group of people. After the first Mongol invasions, the Japanese were smart enough to build walls and fortify their beaches to prevent an imminent second invasion. Many other countries that the Mongols conquered previously were run by a bunch of morons that were more interested in political infighting than to unite against the Mongols.The conquest of Song China. The Mongols were the first foreign group of people to have fully conquered all of China, but they did so at a heavy price. It took the Mongols more than 40 years to defeat all of the remaining loyal Chinese troops, a bloody war that had a body count greater than all of WWI and almost on par with WWII. Quite frankly, at this point in time, the Mongols had essentially exhausted all of their manpower, resources, and money for another great war.Kublai Khan, the emperor, became a raging alcoholic in the 1280\u2019s (around the second invasion of Japan). He became disillusioned with life after losing his son to illness, and no longer had the drive to conquer the world. After Kublai, his successors inherited such a large empire (populated with mostly non-Mongols) that it would cost all the resources and money they had just to maintain it.",

            "answer_text": "Typhoons On their first invasion in 1274, they landed in Kyushu and fought, but withdrew soon. There is a theory that was just a reconnaissance though.  When they came again in 1281, 7 years later, northern Kyushu was well fortified so it was more difficult to land. While they were stuck on their ships a typhoon hit the Mongolian and Goryeon fleet. I think Japan used the 7 year gap better for preparation. The 7 years of Mongolian was used to concur Southern Song Dynasty. Some says that kamikaze suicidal attack at the end of WWII was affected by this lucky win by Typhoon, made Japanese believe they will be saved by supernatural power in the end. ",
