            "answer_text": "Let's take Christopher Columbus. When I was in elementary school in the late 70s and early 80s, we were taught that he \u201cdiscovered America\u201d, and he proved the Earth was round. The names of his ships were not the Nina, etc. and they omitted his crimes against humanity. Historians had known all this for years prior; it was no secret. Nonetheless, that is what was in the textbooks and what teachers told us. This is just one of numerous examples that have come to light over the years: the George Washington story of chopping down the cherry tree was bogus (as was his wooden teeth). There was no mention of the 1921 Tulsa attack (a key moment in black civil rights history). Chameleons don't change color to match their surroundings, etc. etc. ad infinitum. We were then left to figure out this shit for ourselves in adulthood, or corrected in higher education. Whole books and websites have been written on this, illustrating the hundreds of objective falsehoods children are/were taught. I have no idea why they do this, but I'd like to find out. I want to ask teachers and administrators: \u201cWhy did you lie to us? You knew better but still lied to us. Why? What purpose did you hope to serve by teaching us objective falsohoods?\u201d The one forgivable sin is science. New discoveries and changes are occurring at an increasingly rapid pace. It takes time (sometimes years) for new info to filter down to the public and education system. Thank goodness for the internet where we have instant access to bleeding-edge discoveries. I don't know what's being taught today. I hope it's a hell of a lot more accurate than what my generation was taught. Sooo, yeah. Not that I'm bitter, or anything (plot twist: yes, I am bitter about it) ",

            "answer_text": "Context: This question is a very difficult to answer, since this one question has so many possible answers, which, in turn, lead to so many other \u2026 not possible answers \u2026 but so many possible \u2026 questions! Yikes! Humbly, therefore, I offer - not answers (so presumptuous!) - but some observations (much less presumptuous \u2026) Observations: That old Roman guy, Pontius Pilate, posed the basic question (as he washed his hands, nice silver platter, nice linen cloth, nice slave holding both), when he said: \u2018What is truth?\u2019 Meaning that truth is not an absolute, but a relative - depending on how you experience it, why you experience it, when you experience it, & WHO THE HELL IS TELLING YOU TO EXPERIENCE IT ????!!! If truth is relative, then history is a relative, then it can be true (depending on how you see it, rationally, or, even more importantly, how it affects you, emotionally), or it can be false (depending on how you see it, rationally, or, even more importantly, how it affects you, emotionally). Which means that History Books lie (if you disagree with their conclusions), or, History Books do not lie (if you agree with their conclusions). And that means: how do you tell when History Books do not lie, or how do you tell when History Books actually do lie? The Conclusion: History Books do not lie when they have the available facts which confirm the conclusions which you wish to have confirmed. History Books lie when they have the available facts which confirm the conclusions which you do NOT wish to have confirmed. History Books are You. They do not lie, when you wish to believe them. They always lie, when you wish to not believe them. Be like Pilate: wash your hands. Or, be like dat guy Jesus: be crucified. The truth is the truth. The question is: Whose truth\u2026? ",
