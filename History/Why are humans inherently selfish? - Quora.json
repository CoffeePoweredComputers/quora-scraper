            "answer_text": "It\u2019s important that we look after ourselves - in fact, if we are to help others then we need to do that. This does not mean that we are inherently selfish in a bad way - I need to make sure I eat well, I need to get enough sleep, etc; if I don\u2019t do these things not only will I suffer, but it is likely that I\u2019ll cause problems for my friends, family, and clients. So looking after myself is not only about caring for myself but caring for others too. You give examples of people whom you think acted selfishly even though they are known as caring for others and seeking to create a more humane society. I really would not want to get caught up in a discussion about whether that is the case, but I will say that Martin Luther King knew that he might be murdered. Rosa Parks certainly wasn\u2019t taking the easy way out when she made her protest, and Gandhi might easily have been assassinated. Those actions were extraordinarily selfless, and strong evidence that people cannot be merely labelled as \u2018selfish\u2019 - we are more complex than that. We need to care for ourselves and for others, and only when we do both can society run well. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, human beings here on the earth are not selfish. They are destructive and consequently self destructive. It is never selfish to be a criminal, and the human beings of the earth are Universal criminals. Torturing thousands of trillions of animals is of no benefit to themselves, as people inherently pay for all the wrong things that they do . Inherently in this case also means inevitably, as nobody can have the eternal sleep until they have suffered for all the pain that they have caused in the world. That means that all the people of the earth who are connected to the common human gestalt suffer for trillions of years after their deaths. This is why I myself avoid all association with the common human gestalt. It is not selfish to cause pain in the world. It is not selfish to cause poverty in the world either. If Africa was a rich continent, then the global product would be so much higher. Starving billions of children to death is not a selfish way to behave. In no way do I find the humans of the earth to be selfish. ",
