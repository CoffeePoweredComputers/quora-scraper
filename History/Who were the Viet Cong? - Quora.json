            "answer_text": "The term applies to the forces of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (usually abbreviated to National Liberation Front, or NLF), an organization founded in 1959 on the skeleton of the early \u201cViet Minh,\u201d a communist-led coalition that fought against the Japanese and the French from the 1940s onward. They never used the term \u201cViet Cong\u201d themselves - this was a label stuck on them by the Republic of Vietnam (RVN; South Vietnamese government), and was short for \u201cVietnamese Communist.\u201d When I used to teach courses on the Vietnam War I made sure my students recognized this distinction - but in practice \u201cViet Cong\u201d (or the even shorter \u201cVC\u201d) is a convenient shorthand for the armed resistance in South Vietnam. The VC are normally distinguished from the North Vietnamese Army, those forces which entered the South from the North (Democratic Republic of Vietnam; DRV) down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. A more profound, philosophical reading of \u201cWho were the Viet Cong [really]?\u201d is impossible to answer in a short space, since many intelligent men spent years trying to figure out \u201cJust who ARE these guys?\u201d One of the best studies is by Jeffrey Race, an American who was involved in village counter-insurgency in the early 1960s, figured it wasn\u2019t working, went back to the USA, read everything he could, and eventually got a PhD on the topic, published (revised) as War Comes to Long An. War Comes to Long An: Jeffrey Race: Amazon.com: Books (This is the original 1972 edition; there is also a later, revised edition.) Making a long and nuanced analysis far too short and simple, he concludes that at the village level the RVN government did not show itself to be on the side of the peasants, but the VC did. If you\u2019re interested, please read Race\u2019s book, not just this postcard version! ",

            "answer_text": "The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, or Viet Cong, was an a combined political and armed group who fought the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam (ARVN) and the Americans during The American War (The Vietnam War in the west) during the 1960s and 1970s. The Viet Cong should not be confused with the \u201cregular\u201d soldiers of North Vietnam, although both took their orders from Hanoi. The Viet Cong enjoyed success recruiting southern nationalists to oppose American forces. Many members of the Viet Cong carried out their daily lives, including working with American forces, only to don their signature black uniforms at night and carry out attacks. The Viet Cong was an effective fighting force until it over stretched itself during the Tet Offensive of early 1968. In an attack to wipe out the American presence in one coordinated attacks, American counter-attacks defeated the Viet Cong to a point it would not recover. However, the Tet Offensive caused the American public to seriously question its role in South Vietnam. The Viet Cong remained active as a political and military force until North Vietnam finally defeated the South and united the two countries into one. ",
