            "answer_text": "This question is no different than asking why one country is richer to another. Economic theory provides a range of reasons to that question. We can pick and decide. Is it because Greece has larger population? NOIs it because has access to better technology (e.g Internet) and infrastructure ? Maybe if we think its EU membership.Is it because its education system produce good quality human capital and thus innovation? I don't knowIs it because the government manages its economy much better? I don't think so, given that Greece got bankruptIs it because its institutional quality and laws? Maybe, largely due to EUIs it because of Religion? I don't think so, given that Istanbul is catching up with Greece. But might matter if Religion affects any of the previous pointsIs it because of its location? I again I don't think so.We can keep asking such things all the time. The root cause of everything in my opinion will end up to its EU ( not Eurozone, that's different!!) membership. Let me point however that Turkey on constant basis is growing faster than Greece. Very soon will be richer in per capita terms, and at some point much more or equally advanced economy. Thus far for example Istanbul\u2019s GDP per capita in purchasing power terms is very close to Greece\u2019s. Also, most of the \u2018developed thing\u2019 in Greece appears in Athens, maybe some Islands or other touristic places, and in part in other cities. Across country there is much heterogeneity. Same applies to Turkey of course. Developed as some others point, might mean many things including whether one country is democratic or not. There are many institutions that classify countries according to different criteria. OECD, where Greece is member, is the club of rich countries also classified as developed. Turkey is also part of this group. So, I restricted my comparison to economic terms. Other social dimensions may be included. The index of misery is rather similar between these countries. Poverty, however, and illiteracy rates are much higher in Turkey. Inequality is also much better in Greece. Freedom of speech, too. Some of these factors, are very much correlated with stages of development. ",
