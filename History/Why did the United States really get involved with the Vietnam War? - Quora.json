            "answer_text": "Precedent. Because that is how America did it in Korea ten years before. Really, some of the parallels are amazing. I see a trend existing then, broken only by the public's revulsions after Vietnam -- for the most part. As much as I personally am wary of modern day liberals, because of them ideas have apparently pretty much sunk deeply into key generals' heads to do more with less, not asking much from the public. They laid off the histrionics hard sell, at least compared to beforehand. Kudos to liberals and their ways to constantly bring back up the ghosts of Vietnam! Yes, to a degree even in 2000's Iraq and Afghanistan.----------------------------------------------------------------- Back to Vietnam (& Korea comparisons) consider that \"We\" had A) lying, incompetent magnificently poetry talking, blame mongering generals who never seem to know what was really happening in the field yet grabbed as many matters into their own shaky and greedy hands of ownership as was humanly possible for a vain man to do (MacArthur, Westmoreland, Harkins**) . B) exasperatedly pained US presidents who three times seriously contemplated a coup of the nearly impossibly minded ruling leader (Rhee,Diem). C)generals wanting to use nukes and enlarge the war (eg MacArthur & LeMay). D)plus huge undeclared US involvements in Confucist Asian civil wars massively aided by the USSR and the PRC. About 50,000 US were killed in Korea and 70,000 in Vietnam, not to (usually) mention the millions of non US who died. Read up on what kinds of generals Hodge and Roberts were in Korea or Harkins in Vietnam, all before the big shooting started. William Roberts: Korea is impossible for tank warfare. The roads are too narrow and the rice patties too soft. (Thus the two hundred plus Soviet tanks of NK demolished defenseless anti tank or tank less SK in a few days.) He assumed the North Koreans thought the same. They had not. \u201cOn the eve of war, KMAG's commander General William Lynn Roberts voiced utmost confidence in the ROK Army and boasted that any North Korean invasion would merely provide \"target practice\".[108] SK resorted to suicide satchels under tanks, until the supply of volunteers dried up. Then they had to retreat big time, eventually to all the way to Pusan. This earned them the title of loser. And their officers were observed to retreat with them having open umbrellas and white gloves. (Also it did not help that when NK did invade, most of the SK officers guarding the capitalist were at a party opening the new officers club in Seoul. Nor did the fact the division was at one third strength, in large part due to leaves for peasant harvests. Shades of Yom Kippur 1973.) In short, circa 1962 America half thought 'this must be the way to walk through a mine field' as it had been done half successfully that way before. Along comes Johnson, a half wit president in regards to such a delicate issue of Vietnam, who loved magnificent looking generals and we really got into a mud pit. The rest is history. Eisenhower lamented of the late 1950s how a future poor president who did not know how badly the US military operated at times. And how to guide it, ask the right questions. LBJ fell into this trap hook line and sinker, JFK not very good, and Ike died about as Nixon (who would have listened far more) took office. Truman I have more consideration for. It was still understandable to still try to muddle through with good intentions at that point of the Cold War, sort of. After the Korean 'conflict' the information was on the table for those who cared to look. Even MacArthur knew by 1961 or so, and apparently publicly warned the last couple of years he lived to stay out of Vietnam. In Vietnam there were some 15 to 20 years to prepare and study up, and there were the true Korean War lessons to be learned. Unfortunately the delicate situation was heavy ham handed with almost none of the finesse needed or previous lessons truly learned.That is really how America got into Vietnam as we know it today. **Harkins is little remembered now but blindly controlled the show in the early years so badly into a tail spin that no one was able to undo the incredible mess. Later generals sort even admitted as such, like Maxwell Taylor. In the later post 1965 Vietnam War years among the army lower officer corps, a massive brass goof up was called 'pulling a Harkins', especially one covered up to make as if a victory and a project worth continuing effort/funds/time. See 'A Bright Shinning Lie' to get a detailed description of the General. Preview and partial online copy: A Bright Shining Lie  A better understanding of the war, and really, really, really why the US got involved in the Vietnam War, see this video, specifically at the 14:00 minute to 25:00 minute marks. His name is L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n - Wikipedia, who truly controlled Vietnam during those war years:  Here he is  All presidents did give serious thought to the issue. Note how LBJ was being manipulated by his associate here, similar to JFK just a year earlier: While LBJ had some reasoning power, such as the clip: Forum Examines State of Vietnam War in 1967 or the straight video, 8 minute mark (to about 9:00 mark) \u201c I DO NOT BELIEVE WE CAN FIGHT THEM 10,000 MILES AWAY FROM HOME AND EVER GET ANYWHERE.\u201d LBJ 1964 I BELIEVE THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS COME INTO IT, I DO NOT BELIEVE WE CAN FIGHT THEM 10,000 MILES AWAY FROM HOME AND EVER GET ANYWHERE. I DO NOT THINK IT IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR AND I DO NOT THINK WE CAN GET OUT. IT IS JUST THE BIGGEST MS -- IT IS JUST THE BIGGEST DAMN MESS. I LOOK TO THE SERGEANT TO AS SIX LITTLE KIDS -- I LOOK AT THE SERGEANT TO HAS SIX LITTLE KIDS. WHAT IN THE HELL AM I ORDERING HIM OUT THERE FOR? WHAT IS LAOS WORTH TO ME? WHAT IS IT WORTH TO THIS COUNTRY? WE HAVE A TREATY, BUT, HELL, EVERYBODY ELSE HAS A TREATY OUT THERE. YOU START RUNNING THE COMMUNISTS, THEY MAY CHASE YOU INTO YOUR OWN KITCHEN. >> THAT IS WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD IS GOING TO THINK IF THIS THING COMES APART ON US.\\ To repeat \u201cI do not think it worth fighting for and I do not think we can get out. Just the biggest [mess]\u2026 What is it worth to this country?\u201d, and yet only a year later he orders the troops practically at hundreds of thousand increments. However, in the end, even more than JFK, he was talked into involvement by his advisers. Guilty as charged. Nixon was not often talked into dumb foreign policy things (though foolishly was by Kissinger to get involved with the PR fracas with the invasion of Cambodia), nor was Eisenhower in concern to Vietnam.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s complicated and there are a lot of answers. None of them are right; all of them are differing degrees of wrong. Pick your poison. Maybe we got involved because the French got chased out. The French did get chased out of Vietnam, they were (and are) NATO allies, and their colonial proxies in the area had a reasonable claim on \u201chey, you guys said you had our backs.\u201d Maybe we got involved because of Containment. George Kennan wrote his famous \u201cX Telegram\u201d which essentially said \u201cthe way you defeat communism is you prevent it from spreading.\u201d Communism was threatening to engulf South East Asia and the United States policy was to resist. Maybe that\u2019s why we got involved. Or maybe we got involved because of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Sure, that basically didn\u2019t happen the way it was sold to the American people but these things have a way of getting away from people. It\u2019s very difficult to know who knew what when and what their intentions were at every step along the way, so even if Tonkin was a ruse, it\u2019s not clear who got hoodwinked. Or maybe we got involved because Johnson was lost without Kennedy and was never really included in foreign policy conversations until Kennedy was shot. Maybe that\u2019s why military advisors and some financial aid turned into a giant granite wall in Washington DC. Or maybe it was economics. American aid came with the caveat that it be spent on American goods shipped from American ports and that created a crushing pressure on the Vietnamese economy. The Americans bled the Vietnamese white while shutting out the rest of Asia and perhaps a number of them were unwilling to let that cash cow go. Maybe it's all of those things, maybe it\u2019s none of them. Vietnam is a messy conflict that defies a lot of the traditional analytic tools for understanding it. In the end, the memorial in DC is poignant in more than one way: it\u2019s somber and humbling, yes, but it sneaks up on you too. ",
