            "answer_text": "In my reading \u2014 we must define terms \u2014 I define \u201cdialectic philosophy\u201d as the method of logic developed by Kant-Fichte-Schelling-Hegel from 1780 to 1830. It\u2019s a Synthetic Logic, as contrasted with the Analytic Logic of Aristotle and the Analytical School of Bertrand Russell et. al. In very simple terms: Analytic Logic offers two values: TRUE/FALSESynthetic Logic offers three values: TRUE/FALSE/TRANSITIONALIn very simple terms: With Analytical Logic, a college course passing grade would be only A+, and everything else gets an F-. That\u2019s two-valued logic \u2014 Either/Or and no middle ground. It is the most ancient and still the most common form of Logic, even in much modern Science. Synthetic (dialectic) Logic recognizes many nuances of Truth (e.g. A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F+, F, F-). In modern Non-Modal Logic, this might be called, \u201cFuzzy Logic.\u201d In very simple terms: The argument for Dialectic (Synthetic) Logic is that Nature Herself is never a strictly Either/Or affair, but there is an amazing range of Colors in between the extremes. Nature shows that the statement, \u201cthis is a seed,\u201d could be True this month, but False in future months, as the seed sprouts and grows. Thus, Time is the factor that can change True to False, and False to True. This was emphasized especially by the writings of Hegel (ca. 1800\u20131830). By contrast, Analytic Logic is basically \u201cabstract\u201d and lacks a Realistic portrait of Nature. Science observes that \u201cTruth\u201d changes with the regularity of a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d \u2014 still \u2014 a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d usually takes Science by surprise. So, dialectic logic (by my definition above) is a way to appreciate Nature in a more nuanced and realistic manner than Analytical Logic, with its abstract, time- neglecting, \u201cseries of snapshots\u201d approach to Reality. There\u2019s my reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Dialect philosophies basically is interaction with different moralities and ideals but even though there are some contradictions dialectic philosophy allows both contradictions to be accepted and then molded together airtime and reasoning which is kind of how the United States has been formed because of 50 states having very many different types of laws that will contradict each other considering there are states that have legal recreational marijuana some states medical marijuana and another states it is still illegal but the conflicts are still minor and major concerning the event whether it infirst to criminal activity considering the amount of the crime how the crime was committed and if it was a violent crime which changes the circumstances of the crime itself considering that it is illegal in some states for marijuana use in California but you still can't walk down the street smoking a joint because that would be considered the same issue with drinking beer open container public intoxication so dialect philosophy basically tries to integrate and move forward so things that would be considered wrong may be considered to be less of a crime to pending on the type of situation or event concerning violence theft fraud that can the details of the basic crime committed but in general dialect philosophy basically incorporates change and to some extent acceptance and growth ",
