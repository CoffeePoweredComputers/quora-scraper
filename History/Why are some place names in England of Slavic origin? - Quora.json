            "answer_text": "When a name is spoken in the English way you quickly realise the origin does not come from other languages like you are suggesting. Same goes with France. They may have names that look English but when you listen to the natives you quickly realise your error. London in Polish is Londyn - this is never used. Russian for England is \u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u044f or Angliya. Again we never use this in England. Maybe you have a Russian language map of England - best invest in an English OS map. Russian maps of England look like this :  The Russians copied the OS maps and there is a special way of finding out if it is a copy. The OS maps have errors put on the map to identify copying. The Russian maps have these errors. The OS keep these errors a secret obviously - somebody has a list of them well hidden. ",

            "answer_text": "Most English place names are of Germanic origin (English and Norse). A few are derived from Celtic names (like London and Carlisle, and many rivers and mountains). There are a few names copied from Russia by communities such as miners who supported Marxism and the fledgling Soviet Union but their number is tiny. ",
