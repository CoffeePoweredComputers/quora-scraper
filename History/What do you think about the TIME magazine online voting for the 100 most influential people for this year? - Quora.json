            "answer_text": "No they are not real votes. Some 48 hours before the votes started to flow in Modi's favor and against Arawind Kejriwal in thousands a hour which is virtually impossible without a huge and massive campaign which did not happen.  (No am not saying Modi can't get votes am saying technically that kind of response rate is impossible) Shortly after that few AAP supporters started urging others to vote for Arwind Kejriwal so that he wont loose his position on the charts and then the activity seems to have stabilized. Here is why both the groups are wasting their time: The poll is run by PopTip one of the leading online (with special interest in conversation analysis) customer response analyst groups who really know what they are doing. The system if I understand it properly will not produce results just based on the number of votes. Am sure a sanitation process will be run removing all and every fake or artificially created votes on basis of multiple rules that may include but not limited to IP, Geo Location, Service Provider, Cookie Trail, request rates, agent signatures ,use of anonymisation service etc etc. This is done by any serious agency that is doing a important survey  (Which POPTip really is) and am sure neither BJP supporters nor AAP supporters who have worked day and night will not see any fruit of it. The analytical engines that  produce the final results are usually intelligent enough to solve this flooding problem.  Further the listing is not just depending on the number of yes no votes, people seem to have assumed that if one get's more yes votes they go in and if more no votes they go out which may not be the case. There maybe other rules that apply to the voting process. Maybe they will just ignore all votes from within India for the sake of it. My opinion will be the following. 1 : Both Modi and Kejriwal will be in the list at varrying ranks depending on the vote status till some 2 days ago as the flooding seems to have started then.2: Only one will be on the list depending on vote status from 2 days ago.
