            "answer_text": "Spain treated the Indigenous peoples of the Americas with extreme violence, death, torture, mutilation, rape, and enslavement. The Spaniards used their superior weapons, guns,cannons, swords,cross bows, to crush any and all resistance by the Indigenous people. The power of the Church over the Indigenous was used to control them as well. Greed not God drove the Spanish Conquistadores and the priests. The Conquistadores were trained in rigorously in the use of weapons and warfare tactics. They also had the advantage of using horses in battle and using horses to cover long distances quickly. The treatment they subjected the Indigenous peoples of the Americas was that of a torturer over a victim. Inflicting the greatest amount of death to destroy their civilizations amounted to the genocide of millions of people. Out of all the conquests of the Indigenous people of North, South and Central Americas, there was only one group of Indigenous people, the Pueblo tribes in New Mexico, that successfully revolted and drove the Conquistadores and the Spanish priests and settlers out of their lands. Their relationship was that of the conqueror over the conquered. It was established by invasion, battle, total destruction and enslavement by the Conquistadores. The Indigenous people reacted by resistance to the conquest by the Spaniards. Their resistance resulted in millions of deaths at the hands of the Spaniards, including deaths caused by starvation and diseases brought to the New World. Power and control through physical force, and threats of violence was how the Conquistadores established and kept the relationship of master over slave between them. The Spanish Conquistadores of the 16th century Spain were professional soldiers who were trained in the use of weapons and mounted calvary. They explored, sought adventure, and riches in the name of King and Queen of Spain. Most of the Conquistadores were from Spain were Castilian although some were Portuguese, The expeditions in search of new land and riches was underwritten by the King and Queen of Spain, therefore anything they found, they claimed for the Castilian Spanish crown. In addition to the riches for the King and Queen of Spain, the expeditions were to bring Christianity (Catholicism) to any of the Natives of the lands that they encountered. The Catholic Church had enormous power and wealth during the 15th and 16th century\u2019s, especially in Spain. Rome, back in the 12th century, had established Papal Inquisitions for the purpose of routing out heretics but more so, used on anyone that the Pope and Church felt were their enemies. They used it \u201cIn the Name of God the Father and Jesus Christ the Son\u201d to amass power, gain control over political foes as well as friends, and to secure land and wealth for the Church.  By the 15th century, the throne in Castilian Spain established a \u201cSpanish Inquisition\u201d and issued decrees that demanded Jews and Muslims convert to Catholicism or leave Spain. The Inquisition was used by the throne and Church to ferret out \u201cheretics\u201d which most often turned out to be people who had \u201coffended\u201d the throne or Church, people who the throne or Church felt threatened by in someway or people whose land and riches were coveted by the throne or Church. The \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the New World, by a expedition paid for and authorized by the King and Queen of Spain, in 1492, caused a great stir throughout Europe. Spain envisioned exploring and finding vast lands full of riches, including the Fountain Of Youth. The Holy Roman Catholic Church in Spain saw this as a continued opportunity to gain more power and control for the Church in Spain as well as for the Pope in Rome. The Spanish Catholic Church, wanting to keep their coffers over flowing for themselves and Rome, urged the King and Queen to invest in sending more expeditions to the New World. The Church proposed to send along priests to minister to the expeditions and as a opportunity for them (Church) to bring many souls into the Church through baptism. The other \u201cunspoken reason\u201d was that it would give the Church the ability to insure it got its share of secured lands for the Holy Roman Catholic Church along with its \u201cfair\u201d share of the riches. It would also serve the purpose of keeping an eye out for any\u201cpolitical\u201d matters that might be useful for additional power and wealth. Having the presence of the Church also meant that the Spanish Inquisition would/could be active when and if needed. Therefore, along with the Conquistadores went the priests, ready to claim souls for the Church along with claiming \u201cother things\u201d. The Spaniards had first invaded, conquered, and established colonies in \u201cHispaniola\u201d (modern-day Dominican Republic and Haiti. Hernan Cortez, who had left Spain at 19 and settled in Hispaniola as a farmer and notary, spent seven years there. The treament of the Indigenous people by the Spanish was horrific. Many were killed, most had been tortured, raped, mutilated and then forced to work as slaves for the Spanish colonists. In 1511, Cortez heard of a new expedition, under the leadership of Diego Velasquez to conquer Cuba and joined it. While in Cuba, Cortez served in several official capacities and then was appointed as mayor of Santiago. The success that Cortez had in Cuba fueled his ambitions for more power, wealth and excitement. He convinced Velasquez to allow him to head up an expedition to invade and conquer Mexico. But when Velasquez called it off, Cortez took the ships, men and weapons and left anyway. Cortez and the Conquistadores that he led, landed on Mexican shores with an army of 500 men who carried superior European weaponry in 1519. They engaged in a battle with Indigenous people near the village of Tabasco, they quickly subdued the hostiles. Cortez went west and on then to the southwest coast of the Yucatan peninsula where he established Veracruz and claimed it in the name of King Charles of Spain. Here he spent time training his army and the additional Indigenous forces that joined with them into a great fighting force. He used discipline and training on his men to insure they were a cohesive force, he even burned up his ships so no one could leave. He and his forces marched on to the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n in 1519. When the Conquistadores arrived at Tenochtitlan, the Aztecs at first thought Cortez a God. His fair skin and fair hair and eyes set him apart. They arrived on horseback, horses were something that the Aztecs had never seen before and they thought them to monsters with two heads and six legs. They were wearing shiny armor and carrying their superior weapons of rifles, swords, axes, and cannons. The Spanish fired off the guns and cannons which totally scared and intimidated the Aztecs. While the Spanish forces were treated well by Montezuma, the leader and ruler of the Aztecs, the Spanish made it clear they intended to conquer the Aztecs and take control over the city and its wealth. The Spanish sacked the city and took Montezuma hostage. Cortez ruled the city and people by using Montezuma to do his bidding. Later, the Aztecs saw Montezuma as Cortez\u2019s puppet ruler.  Cortez formed an alliance with several of the tribes who were tradional enemies of the Aztecs. They joined forced and under Cortez, they learned the Spanish fighting techniques and in turn, taught the Spanish there fighting techniques. Meanwhile, Velasquez, angry over Cortez\u2019s treachery, sent forces to Mexico to unseat Cortez. When Cortez got wind of this he took a garrison of his men along with the forces of his tribal allies and went out to meet the forces sent by Velasquez. Cortez and his army defeated the Spanish force and then returned to Tenochtitlan, where he found the Aztecs in full rebellion. He took his men and retreated but one of his men was killed and his body left there, which was how the Aztecs contracted small pox. Having no immunity to small pox, the disease ravished the population of the Aztec people living in Tenochtitlan. Over three million Aztecs died as a result of the small pox, and by the time Cortez regrouped and re-entered the city, the population was starving, dying of small pox and they put up little resistance,. Cortez rebuilt the city which had been reduced to ruins by the battles, into a magnificent city where many Spaniards and other Europeans came to settle, Mexico City. Cortez was rewarded by King Charles I of Spain with the governorship of Mexico. Cortez\u2019s invasion and conquest of Mexico , caused the deaths of tens of thousands of the Indigenous people. He enslaved much of the native population, and many of the indigenous people were wiped out from European diseases such as smallpox. \u201cBoth scenarios would unfortunately become a common theme among many explorers' interactions with natives.\" Mexico was named \u201cNew Spain\u201d and became a possession or colony of Spain, the King and the Holy Roman Catholic Church. In 1540, V\u00e1zquez de Coronado, who was the Governor of the providence of Nuevo Galicia, an area in Northwestern Mexico or New Spain, took a large force of Conquistadores, indigenous soldiers, slaves, four Franciscan priests and set out to explore the area North of New Spain. They had heard the stories of the survivors of two previous expeditions, of a large city, as large as Mexico City, high up on a mountain that was built of gold, they called Cibola They had heard stories of \u201cseven cities of Gold or Cibola\u201d as well as fertile expanses of land with large rivers running through. Coronado led his expedition up through New Spain and then into what is now California before cutting over to the east. He eventually arrived at the Pueblo of Zuni, where they were refused entry. They attacked with their superior weapons and trained soldiers and gained entrance. There they re-stocked their supplies by cleaning out the Zuni\u2019s food. From there they went to Hopi, but found no gold there. Again they used force to gain entrance of the village, killing and maiming, and they took the Hopi\u2019s supplies as well. They did winter by the Rio Grande at a village located along the shores. Once again they had to fight the inhabitants, it was a very fierce battle killing hundreds of the Indigenous village people.  Coranado spent time exploring up as far North as Kansas and eventually returned to New Spain (Mexico). 40 years later the Conquistadores returned to the area now called New Mexico. The Chamuscado and Rodr\u00edguez Expedition was led by Friar Rodr\u00edguez and a Spaniard named Chamuscado. It was a small expedition made up of some Spanish soldiers, a four priests, Indigenous slaves and black slaves along with some of the Indigenous people who had been \u201ccivilized\u201d by the friars. They went looking for a village of people who were \u201cadvanced enough\u201d to grow cotton and weave cloth to the north of New Spain (Mexico). They spent more time investigating the Pueblos and were impressed by how prosperous they were. They had bountiful crops of food, enjoyed fish from near by rivers as well as buffalo, deer, elk. They were very impressed by how large the pueblo village\u2019s of two and three story homes built up on mesas.  Eventually, one of the priests wanted to return to New Spain and left. He was killed by some of Indigenous tribes along the way. Later, most of the expedition decided to return to New Spain to report on what they had found. Two of the priests refused to leave and stayed, but were murdered by the Indigenous people a few weeks later. The rest of the party returned to New Spain stirring interest in the colonization of the Southwest, New Mexico,Texas, Arizona and Colorado. In 1598, Juan O\u00f1ate led 500 Spanish settlers and soldiers with over 700 head of live stock to what is now called New Mexico. As governor of New Mexico, O\u00f1ate expected the total subjugation of the Indigenous people even though he commented on the similarities of the Pueblo people to the Spaniards themselves. Juan O\u00f1ate might have not expected much trouble in subduing the Pueblos because of the realative ease with which the Aztecs were conquered. However, it became obvious that the Pueblos were not going to submit so easy. O\u00f1ate later observed and experienced that they were to goingto be tamed like docile sheep. Instead, the Spanish had a revolt by one of the Pueblos, Acoma, that the Spanish brutally quelled. \u201cThe Native Americans at Acoma revolted against this Spanish encroachment but faced severe suppression. In battles with the Acomas, O\u00f1ate lost 11 soldiers and two servants, killed hundreds of Indians, and punished every man over 25 years of age by the amputation of their left foot. The Franciscans found the pueblo people increasingly unwilling to consent to baptism by newcomers who continued to demand food, clothing and labor. Acoma is also known as the oldest continually inhabited city in the United States.\"(Nash, Gary B. Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America Los Angeles 2015. Chapter 1, pg. 5 ) Unlike New Spain, the Spaniards never were able to totally dominate the Pueblo people. \u201cMissionaries attempted to convert the natives to Christianity, but had little success.\u201d Contemporary scholars believe that the objective of Spanish rule of New Mexico (and all other northern lands) was the full exploitation of the native population and resources. As Frank McNitt wrote : \"Governors were a greedy and rapacious lot whose single-minded interest was to wring as much personal wealth from the province as their terms allowed. They exploited Indian labor for transport, sold Indian slaves in New Spain, and sold Indian products...and other goods manufactured by Indian slave labor.\"[14] Wikipedia The Great Pueblo Revolt of 1680 : The Pueblo Revolt killed 400 Spanish and drove the remaining 2,000 settlers out of the province.  The various Pueblo tribes/villages, from the Hopi\u2019s in Arizona, to the Zuni\u2019s and Acomas, in SW New Mexico, along with the Pueblos along the Rio Grande, joined with the Northern Pueblos up to Taos, over a period of three years, led by medicine man named PoPay, years, they plotted to revolt against their cruel and inhumane rule and religion. Finally, on August 13, 1680, they rebelled in mass against the Spaniards and the priests. They were successful in driving the Spaniards completely out of New Mexico for the next 12 years. It was the only time in history that a Indigenous people were able to throw out the European Invaders.  When the Spanish years later. They negotiated a surrender of Santa Fe, where the Governor\u2019s Palace was located and a peace agreement with all of the Pueblos. The Spanish continued to attacked by the nomadic tribes, the Apache and Navajo, but the Pueblos would provide fighters to help the Spaniards because they too face attacks by the two tribes. To this day, many of the Pueblo people have managed to keep their tradional beliefs,ceremonies and UCB of their culture alive because they managed to practice both their religion and the Catholic religion, by intertwining them, without losing their traditional beliefs. Note: Much of what I related here is history that I was taught orally, and later, in school by book. I was born and raised in New Mexico on a Pulebo Indian Reservation. My Pueblo great grandmother, and great great Aunts all told us children the stories that had been passed on for generations. I also was given the Spanish version of the history from my great grandmother, who had blonde hair, blue eyes and spoke pure Castilian Spanish. Her great- great -grandparents were part of the original Spanish settlers. I also used resources from Wikipedia and a very rare old book, \u201c New Mexico : Land of The Delight Makers\u201d by George Wharton James, copyright 1920  This is a older photo of the Village of Laguna,where I was born and raised  This photo is one often seen in books on Pueblo Indians. They are a man and his wife, he is a leader of Laguna and is supposedly related to me. ",

            "answer_text": "Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s had a mestizo son with the indian translator woman he had been given as a present by indians (Marina o Malinche) He referred to his son as \"the beating of my heart\", and adored him more than the legitimate ones; while two centuries later the president of the USA Thomas Jefferson sold the children he had with a black slave girl. There were plenty of natives in California until the anglos took over. Spain did a census in Alta California (including San Diego, Santa Barbara, Monterrey and San Francisco) as provinces in 1790. There were 150.000 aborigines. Took settlers from 1849 to 1890 to wipe them all out. What happened in the Eastern side?. Indians were simply systematically massacred, expelled and enslaved throughout the British colonial period and also when the 13 colonies became independent. The Spanish mixed with the natives and the whites, Anglo-Saxons and Protestants, displaced them, took the land from them and if they opposed, they killed them, but they never had mestizos. The miscegenation in the territories of the Spanish Empire was a perfectly designed policy based on the legal family and marriage. In contrast, it should be noted that interracial marriages were prohibited in some US states. USA Until the 60s of the 20th century. By contrast, the founding father of the United States, George Washington, in 1779 ordered that as many Indians as possible be killed without making any age or sex concessions or distinctions. In his own written words, \u201cIt is essential to destroy not only men, but also their villages and plantations. Everything planted will be uprooted and any new planting or harvest will be avoided. What lead can't do, hunger and winter will. \" Or Thomas Jefferson later complained along the same lines, that the \"backward tribes\" of the border would once again \"fall into barbarism and misery, see their membership reduced by war and scarcity, and we We will be forced to move them, along with their forest beasts, towards the mountains\" You cannot run from your DNA. The consequences can still be seen: in the former Spanish America, there still are large indigenous populations, and indigenous languages are still widely spoken, while in the USA, native peoples have almost disappeared, and there is little left of their languages. Go to Peru or Mexico and you\u00b4ll see that +90% of population has Spanish and indigenous DNA. Less than 3% north of Rio Grande. In America, the colonization style of the Spanish was to conquer and merge, christianizing and civilizing. So they founded schools and universities practically from the very beginning (the first university in America was university of Dominican Republic being founded in 1538), plus documenting and preserving the local languages. Certainly there were abuses, but laws were dictated against that and whenever possible, they were enforced. Columbus himself suffered the rigors of those laws. As a result, Spanish America has more than 100 million pure indigenous inhabitants and a large majority of mixed population, with a minority of white inhabitants, mostly descendants of recent migrations. On the other hand, the anglo-dutch colonisation style implied the total elimination of the natives before settling the of the colonist families, by means of a systematic genocide or by pushing the indigenous population to the west. Spain did not treated Native americans horribly. Indians use to fled west and south to enter Spanish territories, out of reach of the Anglo-Saxon settlers. Of course there were cases of abuse. It is normal in a 3 to 4 centuries colonization and taking into account the historical context, but in many cases also were there were complaints and trials that favored indians and also convictions when they occurred Spaniards questioned themselves if colonization was a right or not (in 16th century, something impressive) and produced the Laws of Burgos as early as in 1512, 20 years later of americas\u2019 discovery. The Spanish had abolished Indian Slavery in 1512. They were the first laws that the Hispanic Monarchy issued for their application in the Indies or the New World or America in which they abolished indigenous slavery and organized their conquest, which were signed by the Catholic King Ferdinand II, on December 27, 1512, in the city of Burgos, for the government of the natives, Indians or natives and that were the result of the first meeting of theologians and jurists, where it was discussed and concluded - continuing the medieval tradition that prioritized the evangelization of the Indian and that that superior good justified other possible evils - that the King of Spain had just titles of dominance of the American continent and that the Indian had the legal nature of a free man with all property rights, which could not be exploited. This was the origin of modern International Laws handled by UN. I can also argue explaining than Spain created publishing houses, hospitals and universities by dozens. 2 centuries before compared to any other typically extractive colonization and anywhere in the world that has been colonized, not only in America but also in Asia or Africa. In these hospitals or universities any native can be treated or study. Can you imagine a sioux studying in Harvard in 17th century? This is unheard of. This happened in spanish american regions frequently. Compare amount of universities in Spanish territories with the 13 colonies which founded Harvard and St Mary College more than a century later than Spain.  The Spanish did not enslave the indigenous people and of course they did not systematically kill or exterminate them. Still less in the territory of New Spain that today is part of the United States. Spain encouraged them to leave nomadism, tried to convert them to Christianity, gave them cattle and horses, and even settled next to the missions and taught them agricultural techniques. That's what missions were for. More than 200 in current USA land.  I\u00b4ll put you a good example: Geronimo, the last apache, Geronimo was born in Arizpe (today, in the Mexican State of Sonora), he was born on June 1, 1821. The town was founded by the Jesuit Jer\u00f3nimo del Canal, so the name was frequent among the Bendokes. Geronimo and his parents were baptized, and the recently discovered baptismal records remain. They were sedentary and productive, that is, they did not engage in predatory raids. That came later, when between the Mexican and American authorities they were left with no other option to survive. Look at his signature:  This is not apache, not anything. It is pure spanish. Geronimo The first document that mentions the existence of the Apaches was written in Taos in 1702. In 1720 an Apache embassy arrived there requesting permission to settle in the territory, permission that is granted by the Spanish governor. They were coming from the East because of the pressure of english settlers and comanches to spanish territory. In that strip of territory of New Spain, there was the Apacher\u00eda, which is the name of the region where the Apaches settled when they crossed the borders of the Spanish empire in the 18th century seeking protection During this full century 1700-1800 in the viceregal period there were no notable conflicts and that the Apaches lived reasonably integrated within the empire. Do you realize that that last Apache, the Indian Ger\u00f3nimo spoke Spanish? They were not hostile tribes it was a hispanomestizo world. You are parroting a lot of myths btw. It's hilarious how you whitewash your own history. ",

            "answer_text": "Spain was very cruel in its treatment of Native Americans. But it was not racist. They relied on the good will of the Indians. The Catholic Church replaced the Conquistadors in the USA to try to control and changed the Indians. The Spanish tried to make the Indians Spanish but that never worked. In places like California, they wanted the Indians to take over their defense of California from them because the Spaniards feared that Russia would take over California and the Spanish needed California to remain Spanish in order to use it as a buffer state to protect the Silver mines of Mexico.The Spanish all over Spanish America had a system called the Encomienda, which was a system where the Indians were like servants. They had to work in the fields.The mission was used to Christianize the Indians but many would run away and the soldier had to go and get them back.The Presidio was like a fort and the soldiers would be stationed there and it was not very far from the Mission.Spain's attempts to use the Indians for whatever goals they had failed miserably. The Spanish would not or would not learn from their mistakes. The Spanish empire in Central and South America was too big for Spain to manage it successfully. Spain was a declining nation in the 1700s. In 1800 there was a resurgence of Spanish power that lasted for a short while and then various parts of Central and South America created their own countries and became independent from Spain.Mexico, which is the main nation that came out of the Spanish empire continued the same policies as Spain. For example, in Florida, before the independence of many Central and South American nations, the Spanish allowed Americans to settle down in Florida. Two of the agreements that I know of were that Americans should : 1) learn Spanish; and, 2) become Spanish citizens. The Americans promised to do so but were quick to forget these commitments and eventually took over Florida and made it American.The same thing was repeated in Mexico. In spite of the fact that now Mexicans ruled Mexico, their policies were similar to those of Spain when it came to Americans living in Mexico. Because the Americans failed to meet these requirements, and because there were injustices in Texas that Americans did not like, Texas eventually became independent from Mexico. And all the while nothing was done to included the largest Indian group in Texas who still controlled most of Texas. We get the impression that the Indians were far from every centers but in this case, they controlled most of Texas and the impression is still that there were only Americans and Mexicans there. ",

And we also have many cases in which the Spaniards arrived with good intentions and they were received with violence. In any case it is well known that the leaders of some American nations even got nobility titles and land captured to common enemies and you could find them years later fighting for Spain in the Phillipines (Tlaxaltecs were formidable warriors). I would avoid the English and North American propaganda texts and I would read the primary sources like the accounts of Ulrich Schmidel or many others. You learn and understand how it was to be part of a Spanish expedition, how sometimes things went fine and the encounter with natives was a good experience and how sometimes things went bad and not necessarily because the Spaniards did anything wrong.

We had a stone age level culture when the Spanish arrived on their 3 ships. This stone age level of technology clashed head on with the most powerful military entity of the end of the Renassaince. Steel, cannon germs and horse were what gave the Europeans the edge. The Taino welcomed the Spaniards as possible allies against their foes the feared Galibs (Caribs). The Taino gave the Spanish all the gold they could carry, women and slaves. The filthy Spanish that arrived to a green, clean and lush plentiful paradise yet this was not enough. Their greed and avarice made them want it all. The Queen of Spain, Isabel was deeply moved by the harm inflicted on the Taino and she listened to the Friars, Montesinos, Las Casas and other religiously pious men who were genuinely horrified at the treatment of the natives. Yet there was only so much she could do. Then the European diseases arrived and that finished off much of the original Taino on the Island of Santo Domingo. Yet many of the children born from Spaniard and Taino survived and these are the heirs of the those proud indigenous people that endured after the Spanish apocalypse. ",
