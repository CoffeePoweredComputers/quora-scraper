There is evidence of an early civilisation in Armenia in the Bronze Age and earlier, dating to about 4000 BC. Archaeological surveys in 2010 and 2011 at the Areni-1 cave complex have resulted in the discovery of the world's earliest known leather shoe, [44] skirt, [45] and wine-producing facility. [46] Not that Turks aren\u2019t ancient, just not in that part of the world. Footnotes[1] Azerbaijanis - Wikipedia",

There is no way that Azerbaijan can historically belong to Armenia, when Armenia is just a tiny little spectacle of land, with a very small population, as compared to Azerbaijan.
