            "answer_text": "Context is pretty important here. With the Japanese domestic market, efficiency is highly regarded, and kei cars are all the rage (cars about the size of the scion iq). They have small displacement engines and are pretty Spartan in all the interior commodities in the name of saving weight. The German domestic market is different. There is a market for economy cars (Opel) but that isn't available in the US domestic market. We are more used to luxury and performance brands like Mercedes, bmw, audi, Porsche; and semi-luxury in volkswagen. These cars have higher displacement engines with more cylinders for a smoother, quieter ride. They have a lot of bells and whistles, and sound deadening to ride more quietly and surely, which adds weight. If you compare USDM cars by size class you'll find the mpg difference is quite small. Mid size- VW passat: 23/34 city/hwyHonda accord: 27/36.Toyota Camry: 24/33.BMW 320i: 23/35.Compact sedan- vw jetta: 28/40Audi a4: 27/37Toyota corolla: 30/40Acura ILX: 25/35I could keep going but, you have access to Google I'm sure. This is excluding hybrids, there is no contest there which is more efficient. Japanese all the way. One more thing to mention, Germany has a much more prolific diesel market than the US does, so people buying cars in Europe with the interest of paying less for fuel will opt for that (vw Polo). ",

            "answer_text": "Only Japanese hybrids are more efficient. If you\u2019re comparing cars from Germany (VW, Audi, Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Opel) vs Japanese (Honda, Toyota, Mazda, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru etc) compare size and class of vehicle and you will see that they are very similar. German cars have a long history in Diesel engines which are more fuel efficient than Japanese petrol engines. Of course, if you compare a big luxury car with a small hatchback, you\u2019re going to find big differences in fuel efficiency. But if you compare like-with-like, you will find them quite similar.
