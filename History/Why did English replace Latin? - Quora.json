            "answer_text": "Latin, as an everyday spoken language, gradually split into a variety of dialects spoken in different parts of the western Roman empire. After the western empire collapsed in the 400s CE, those dialects gradually grew further apart until they were no longer the same language. This point was reached around the 700s or so. At that point, Latin was no longer the everyday language of any family, and children no longer learned Latin as their native language. Latin continued to be a language used by the western Christian church. Because the church was the main institution where formal learning took place during the Middle Ages, Latin became the language of learning. But it was a foreign language to all who learned it, and it took years of study to master it. At the same time that Latin was dying as a native language, a new language was developing from a group of Germanic dialects brought to the country we know as England. That language, Old English, took the place of Latin dialects as the most important spoken language of what is now England by the 500s CE because speakers of Old English conquered the towns where forms of Latin had been spoken. Old English would change dramatically over the centuries to emerge as modern English during the time of the Tudor monarchs in the 1400s and 1500s. English was the native language of millions of people in England. With the conquest of Ireland, the union of Scotland with England, and centuries of English rule over Wales, English spread to those countries as well. (Note that in Scotland, Scots is also spoken. Scots developed independently from Old English. Linguists disagree about whether Scots is a dialect of English or a separate language.) By the 1700s, Latin had largely given way to the leading European languages, including English, as a language of scientific and scholarly discourse. This was inevitable, because these living languages made learning accessible to much larger audiences than an ancient language like Latin, which was nobody\u2019s first language. Beginning in the 1600s, English spread around the world to colonies established by England or the United Kingdom in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. By the 1900s, English was spoken as a native language by hundreds of millions of people. Because the world\u2019s leading economies during the 1800s and 1900s were English-speaking and because English was spread to so many countries around the world under the British empire, English became the world\u2019s most widely spoken second language and the main language of international communication. By the mid-1900s, this dominance made English the undisputed language of science and learning as well as the most widely spoken language in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "English never replaced Latin except in special areas. Due to ordinary processes of language change, such as invasions, borrowings, and normal changes over time, Latin became Italian. That was in parts of Italy. Old English (and languages that preceded it in England) changed due to ordinary processes of language change, such as invasions, borrowings, and normal changes over time. That was in parts of the British Isles. Latin was so well respected that learned men for a long time used Latin to write scientific papers. (I am not sure that it was ever a spoken language at international gatherings.) At some point, the spread of English internationally helped replace Latin with English in international gatherings, scientific journals, and international rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. However, the latest iteration of Latin is called Italian and it is spoken in Italy. Old English became Middle English and then Modern English and it is currently spoken as a native language in England, the US, New Zealand, and Australia by many people\u2014and perhaps a few other places.
