            "answer_text": "Moabites were already gone as a separate nation by Nehemiah\u2019s day (5th century BCE). Their area was overrun by Arabs, so it is possible that Moab dissolved into the Arab population. Jeremiah does promise that Moab will return at the end of days. Ammonites lasted much longer. They are mentioned as a numerous nation as late as second century CE. They lived in present-day Jordan. Then they disappeared from the historical record. We have no idea what happened to them. Perhaps they assimilated into the Roman culture. ",
