Hence the higher castes of society do not want to be touched by lower human life justbin case he accumulation of their sins will be somehow passed on in a touch - Hence you have the category of UNTOUCHABLES ! I cannot say that I am in favour of this , but never say that I do not understand - EXACTLY WHY! In other words ? These are now returns after time in Asuraloka and Naraka and are now your very good neighbours and yet all still - UNTOUCHEABLE\u2014\u2014\u2014  JEFFRY DAHLMER  MAI TSE TUN  HEYNDRICK - NAZI !  GENGIS KHAN !  MOST EVIL MEN that EVER LIVED- untouchables?  IDI AMIN - He now Carrys Away your waste !  LYBIAN DICTATOR !  HIMMLER ?  Hitler - He is perhaps one of your untouchables ! Would you let him take care of Your children? Or cook your food ? Again ! He is now only good for cleaning the waste from the insides of Your toilet place and nothing more! because NOW \u2014\u2014-he is an UNTOUCHABLE!  I rest my case! ",
