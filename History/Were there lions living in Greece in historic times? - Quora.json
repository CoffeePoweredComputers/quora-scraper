            "answer_text": "Fabio Paolo Barbieri is right. There were lions in Greece when Xerxes invaded. They mostly lived in the North where there were still forests and large prey (eg water buffaloes). Lion hunting was a sport for Macedonian nobles. This is mosaic from Pella (last quarter of 4th c. AD) that is believed to depict Alexander and his friend Hephaestion.  We have no way of knowing whether this lion hunt ever took place or wherem but there is an historic account of their existence. Herodotus in his Histories relates that they lived in mainland Greece in the regions that are today the Greek prefectures of Thrace, Macedonia and Thessaly and that they attacked Xerxes\u2019 camels. As Xerxes marched by this route, lions attacked the camels which carried his provisions; nightly they would come down out of their lairs and made havoc of the camels alone, seizing nothing else, man or beast of burden. I wonder what prevented the lions from touching anything but the camels, creatures which they had not seen and had no knowledge of until then. In these parts there are many lions and wild oxen, whose horns are those very long ones which are brought into Hellas. The boundary of the lions' country is the river Nestus which flows through Abdera and the river Achelous which flows through Acarnania. Neither to the east of the Nestusanywhere in the nearer part of Europe, nor to the west of the Achelous in the rest of the mainland, is any lion to be seen, but they are found in the country between those rivers. Aristotle also mentioned much the same thing, but I can\u2019t find the reference. To get your bearings the camels were attacked near Therma as Xerxis was leaving the Halikidiki peninsula. Therma was a Greek polis that gave its name to Thermaikos gulf. Just for the fun of it I used Google maps to give you an idea of where they might have been. You can see that even today the region is still very much forested. No there are no lions, but there is an abundance of wild boar and there are wolves.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well nobody can really answer that because none of us lived then. But, What\u2019s written in that link doesn\u2019t necessarily need to refer to an actual lioness actually tearing that Phil guy to pieces because he took her cub. If anybody actually sat down and wrote that, they were probably aiming to get another message across. Why on earth would some person sit down and write that Phil took a cub and got killed by the lioness? Where\u2019s the proof that this happened? What was the point in mentioning it? What was the point in writing about it? Why is that being studied today? Read behind the words and see what you find. What message did the author want to get across? It\u2019s probably bullshit though don\u2019t go too crazy about it. It\u2019s not the first piece of bullshit about Greece and most definitely not the last. ",
