            "answer_text": "He would be unimpressed with modern Britain because: his statue was vandalised - hard not to take that personallySome people think he was racist. By today\u2019s standards he was. He was against Indian independence because he thought Indians were incapable of governing themselves. He hated Ghandi who is revered not just in India, but by many in the world.He\u2019d be shocked at the amount of Indians living in Britain and serving in senior government portfolios.the British Empire is no more. He was a big believer and defender of the Empire because of the dominance and status it brought Britain. Fact was Britain couldn\u2019t defend it during the war; couldn\u2019t afford to administer it afterwards; and most people it colonised wanted Britain out, as the the mother country failed to defend them, exploited and infantilised them. Most Brits had no experience of the Empire nor were that interested in it, beyond the status it gave the UK as a world power.Britain is still not the global power (it was not when he died), but he\u2019d be disappointed it never reclaimed that position.As an staunch anti Communist, he\u2019d be joyous about the collapse of the USSR and the Eastern Block.He\u2019d be horrified at China\u2019s rapid development into an economic and military superpower (because China is Communist and Asian - he couldn\u2019t fathom that a non Western and communist country could achieve this global status).He\u2019d be dismayed that staff would complain about his inappropriate behaviour or expectations - drinking on the job, holding meetings while he was still in bed, throwing temper tantrums, staff being on call at all hours (those bloody socialist industrial agreements!) or expecting his secretary to take dictation while he bathed (albeit outside the door). Can\u2019t do that now, even if you were PM.Contempt for smoking laws and all the \u201cnonsense\u201d about passive smoking - Illegal now to smoke the trademark cigar inside number 10, in the car or anywhere else that is enclosed or X metres from a building entry. What to do??So Churchill would be dismayed and in conflict with global development, modern laws and values, particularly around equality of races, multi culturalism, anti discrimination, self determination, universal suffrage and global support of decolonisation, etc. ",
