            "answer_text": "Very gradual. In the middle ages, when firearms began to slowly become recognized as viable weapons, they were cumbersome and expensive miniature versions of cannons. They needed dry wadding and powder, shot, or ball, and a viable ignition source. They were heavy, cumbersome, slow to reload, and a hard rainfall could put an entire armed force out of business, if they couldn\u2019t keep their powder dry. Needless to say, soldiers used to hardier, lighter, quieter. and more dependable and re-usable swords, spears and long-bows were somewhat unwilling to wholeheartedly embrace being vulnerable for the 15 to 20 seconds it took to reload a firearm, if you were good at it, which most of them weren\u2019t.. So, it was a slow change, which took over a century to take on. ",

            "answer_text": "Because firearms were not (and are still not particularly) cheap, the transition was slow. The first firearms made their appearance around 1400, but combat by sword was still common in the War between the States (1861) and to a lesser extent in 1918. Over time, the changes in warfare included: The disappearance of the \u201cknight in shining armor.\u201d By 1550, no human body could carry armor that would stop a bullet.The replacement of knights and chivalry by huddled masses of conscripts, although some chivalric ideals remained until recent times.As muskets and cannons developed, battles joining at longer ranges.",

Early firearms were not very effective, and hard to load and fire. And not very accurate. As firearms improved , they started to take over more and more of the melee weapons. Basically, you could train someone to use a firearm in an afternoon. Melee weapons took time and practice to learn to be used effectively. ",

Metallurgy was iffy, at best. Bronze barrels and heavy stocks did not make for rapier lightness. Only the richest could afford them, much less to equip an army. The earliest ideas of fielding firearms were \u201cwe can outrange arrows\u201d, so lets have a few fusiliers\u201d. The evolution after that was a marvel of human ingenuity!! But slow, expensive, and heavy would describe the earliest transitions. ",

Things like soft trigger pull remains the same with a handgun like it does with a sniper rifle. Breathing techniques remain the same as well. The only differences involves stances and gripping the 2 different kinds of firearms. ",
