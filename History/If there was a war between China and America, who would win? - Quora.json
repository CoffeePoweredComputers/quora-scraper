            "answer_text": "This is a very difficult question to answer. Because you will explain a problem from different directions, for example, you can analyze it from military, economic, political, even mathematical and statistical angles. I try to answer your question from a cultural perspective. If China and the United States really do that, the final result will be heavy losses, both the United States and China.  I. Mutual distrust caused by lack of communication Many people will think that if China is strong, it will have military actions against neighboring countries. Actually, it's not necessarily true. The Chinese government's policy clearly states: \"It is our territory, and we will not lose an inch; It is not our territory, we will not want it. \"  But I can understand why so many countries have serious concerns about China's rise. According to the US government's point of view, whether China is a threat depends not on how China expresses its position, but on whether China has the ability. For example, if you are an American policeman, when you arrest a suspect, if the suspect fails to follow your requirements after repeated warnings, then you can shoot him. Because American police are not sure whether a suspect will attack him, killing him is a way to ensure their own safety.  The best way to meet a policeman in America is to obey orders. Don\u2019t do anything stupid. This is like a paradox. In fact, China does not have the right to speak in the world. There are 1.4 billion Chinese people who use Chinese, but how many foreigners really understand Chinese? How many foreigners really know China? Similarly, how many Chinese people can really speak English? At the same time, most powerful countries use English, and most English-speaking countries are skeptical and conservative towards China. China is like a dumb man, while America is like a \"blind man\". When a dumb man and a blind man are locked in the same room, and they both have weapons in their hands, what do you think they will do?    The picture is from \u201cSAW 4\u201d Therefore, it is not China that says it is safe, but other countries will think China is safe. This is a manifestation of the paradox of national security. It's not just that the Chinese and the US governments don't trust each other, and the people don't trust each other. Even if it's an intimate couple, the husband suddenly won't let his wife touch his mobile phone one day, and even if it's his random behavior, the wife will wonder if his husband cheated.  A. The US government will not trust the Chinese government The Asia-Pacific region is currently the most economically developed region and the region with the greatest economic potential. The global domination of the United States determines that the US government will not allow itself to be absent here.  It can be seen from the map that the US military base here basically completely surrounds China. Although China cannot fully confront the United States, China's regional power cannot be ignored in the Asia-Pacific region. The US government's economy itself is very dependent on foreign trade. As the largest trading partner of the United States, do you think the US government will accept a country, China, which is not an ally of the United States? In my other article, I analyzed why the US government needs to maintain a high military budget. This is determined by the national nature of the United States, not by one's personal wishes. Chuen Yao's answer to Why shouldn't the USA reduce their defense budget since it is already way more than double the second highest spender (China)? B. The Chinese government will not trust the US government either. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the attitude of the American government towards the Chinese government has changed. At one time, China and the United States had an enemy to face together, the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union did not exist, the necessity of the existence of this alliance was lost. For example, during World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were allies, but after the end of World War II, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union began in less than five years.    Before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the enemy of the United States was the Soviet Union. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the United States and NATO countries took over the sphere of influence of the former Soviet Union in 10 years and further expanded their sphere of influence.   In the 21st century, the enemy of America is Al Qaeda. It took the United States 10 years to wage the war against terrorism. When Al Qaeda is eliminated, who will be next? Russia? No, frankly speaking, Russia can't confront the United States now. Russia is of little economic value to the United States. But China is different.   When Obama decided to return to the Asia-Pacific, China knew that it had to prepare for the possible conflict between China and the United States.  C. Will there be a war between China and America soon? If the President of the United States is a normal president and the President of China is a normal president, the possibility of an all-out war is very low. But now the president of the United States is Trump, an idiot who loves adventure but knows nothing about international politics (sorry, no offense). We never overestimate Trump's wisdom, but we will never underestimate Trump's destructive power.  (Sorry, no offense, I just google the pictures of idiots\u2026) Now the US Navy is in the South China Sea, and the US Air Force is patrolling the Chinese coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the Chinese coast. If China does this in the Gulf of Mexico and flies around Orlando, will the US government allow it? China is now exercising great restraint because the current president of the United States is Trump. A president who has gone bankrupt three times won't know how terrible war is once it breaks out. Therefore, Chinese people are more anxious than Americans to wait for November. Let the president go quickly.   II. What are you fighting for? This is a very critical issue. Your purpose determines your determination, and your determination determines the final process. For example, a cheetah is hunting a deer. If the cheetah fails, the cheetah loses only one meal; If a deer fails, it loses a life. Then you can think about what deer will do when facing cheetahs. The US is the cheetah, while China is the deer. Many people say that China is a powerful country now. Yes, China is strong now. But a powerful China is not a country with a tradition of expansion in essence. And China also does not have the ability to confront the United States in an all-round way. China's strength is like the deer running faster, instead of suddenly having teeth like cheetahs. A. How many American soldiers really know what they are fighting for? Here I tell a story about cultural differences. In eastern countries, such as China, Japan, and South Korea, surrender is regarded as a shame. For example, in World War II, defeated Japanese soldiers would commit suicide. The Japanese believe that suicide is glorious while being captured by the enemy is a sign of cowardice. In China, there is often a saying that \"people are in the position\", which means that as long as I am alive, the position is in my hands. The enemy wants to seize the position unless they kill me. Maybe there are only a few people on the ground, and there is no hope of victory at all, but the Chinese soldiers will continue to fight until they die before receiving orders.   On the contrary, western countries are not. A soldier's life is more important than victory. If all the soldiers died, it would be impossible to win again. If the soldiers are still alive, there is still the possibility of victory. Even if there is no chance of victory, surrender can avoid unnecessary casualties. Therefore, what the East does is not necessarily disrespectful to live, and what the West does is not necessarily a shame. This is just a cultural difference. What about American soldiers? I think American soldiers are one of the best soldiers in the world. The extraordinary courage displayed by American soldiers in World War II won the respect of people all over the world. But do American soldiers really think what they have done in Iraq and Afghanistan is right? Perhaps many American soldiers will think that they have liberated the people of Iraq and Afghanistan from centralized leadership. But this is what Americans think, and do Iraqis and Afghans really think so? If American soldiers bring death and pain to other countries, and people in other countries look at you with unfriendly eyes, what will you think in your heart? I used to study in the United States. I am an ROTC of the US Marine Corps. I also have many friends from American soldiers. To be honest, I think Americans are really friendly, lovely, and kind. They don't have so many complicated ideas. Their favorite things are playing ball, playing cards, playing games, fighting, finding girls, and eating pizza. But they also know that they are soldiers and need to do so. But when I saw my friend come back from Afghanistan, he seemed to have changed. War will turn a boy into a man, but it will also leave him with scars that will be hard to erase all his life.  I don't deny the military strength of the United States, but I doubt very much how determined the United States is to kill the Chinese government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. China is larger than the United States. If it is not completely occupied, China will continue to resist. If the American soldiers think that the Japanese soldiers in World War II are already terrible, then the Chinese soldiers will give you further experience. At that moment, China will be hell, and the American soldiers who came here also stepped into hell. The American government attaches great importance to the lives of American soldiers. So is the US military ready to attack China at the cost of millions of lives in China? If Vietnam's losses are unacceptable to the United States, then I don't think American soldiers need to treat their lives as games. You can start over when the game is over, but you can't start over when life is over.    B. How many Chinese soldiers really know what they are fighting for? Is the US government here to liberate China? Chinese people are very happy now, and they don't need the liberation of the US. You can come to China and have a look. Does the US government want Chinese land? The US government has no idea of occupying land since World War II. If you want to support the puppet government in China, the cost is far higher than the cost of US military operations. Is the U.S. government going to rob China of its resources? China itself doesn't have much resources. America's per capita resources are much richer than China's. Is it necessary for you to grab them? What are the reasons why the United States and China started it? I think it may be the political needs of the country. But I hope American soldiers understand that the purpose of American soldiers' military action is only a task, but the resistance of Chinese soldiers is not only a task but a national responsibility. If American soldiers die, the government will feel sorry, but Chinese soldiers die for their country. Although China is not as powerful as the United States, it will be a terrible existence for Chinese soldiers to go to the battlefield with the determination to die. China paid 20 million lives to defend its national independence in World War II. This is China's determination. It's like you made a super-large Lego model. Now that your brother has stepped on it, do you want to beat him? China has paid such a high price in exchange for today's living space, so does the US government have the courage to challenge such a country? I don't doubt America's ability, but I doubt America's courage and determination. Is it worth it?  And all this in itself can be avoided. III. Only those who have experienced war know the value of peace. There is a good saying in China: Only the sun and people's hearts can't look directly with their eyes. The sun is dazzling, and people's hearts may be very dark. We can't make all people friends, but we can make all people not easily enemies. War is the most fierce thing, and it will destroy everything. Although my major is military, I am very opposed to war. Maybe many people have never seen someone die in front of you. Maybe many people have never seen a sudden cold shot and let your friend's brains crack. I believe that after you have seen it, you will understand how terrible war is. Just like snipers, they will lurk very well, but can snipers ensure that they will never be caught and can always leave the battlefield safely? Once snipers are caught, they are often not treated as ordinary prisoners of war but shot directly. Therefore, it is best not to fight. A war between China and the United States would be a disaster for the whole world. Of course, only soldiers who are not afraid of death can have a greater chance to survive on the battlefield. Exercise every day can protect yourself and your family, but it doesn't mean you can bully others at will. The reason why China has not been invaded today is not because of the kindness of neighboring countries, but because China has a sword in its hand. Having a sword in hand and having no sword in hand are two completely different concepts. Finally, I want to say. Every one of us is a parent's child, and we will also be parents of children. There is a good saying in China, \"\u5df1\u6240\u4e0d\u6b32\u52ff\u65bd\u4e8e\u4eba which means don't impose what you don't want on others.\" You don't want to die, and so do others. I hope that the US government and the Chinese government can devote themselves to global peace and stability instead of fighting each other. If a dumb man and a blind man can kindly tell each other that I am not a bad person before fighting, perhaps conflict can be avoided. Therefore, communication and dialogue are very important.   The hero's sacrifice is not to make us enemies again. ",

            "answer_text": "HiI answered a similar question. Chinese are an emerging economic power. They realized a long time ago the failure of the Marxist economic model and chose the hybrid socialist-capitalist one instead. The availability of ultra-cheap labor gave them an edge few other countries could compete with. A strong authoritarian government-run economy made it a formidable force. However, as the Japanese noticed decades ago, other nations had resources that could feed a hungry growing nation. The South China Sea is a wealth of traffic, oil, fish, and other countries with resources. China has begun to bully its way through and claim other countries' properties. The problem is they don\u2019t want to voluntarily surrender those to the Chinese. China has been flexing its military might to push back and intimidate. Ask yourself why is China spending so much on expanding its military if it doesn't have more obvious expansion gains in mind. As the Japanese did in the 1930s, you start taking from weaker neighbors. The Chinese began to build \u2018permanent carriers\u2019 or islands to serve as bases to expand their operations\u2014much like the Japanese did with their Navy pre-WWII. Now they are in direct conflict and competition with Vietnam, the Philipines, Japan, South Korea, etc. The US has long been a bastion and protector of the region and free-market exchange. Therefore, it seems inevitable that these two superpowers will converge at some point. The problem will be that the Chinese have a military that is untested, unpracticed, and inadequate. One major strength of any military conflict is the knowledge and skill of the fighting opponents. It is one thing to muster up a massive amount of conscripts but you need seasoned leaders to train and guide them. The Chinese don\u2019t have any. Their last real experience as a fighting force was their three-week invasion of Vietnam in 1979 in defense of their protectorate, the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia. The Sino-Vietnamese War was a total disaster for the PLA. (see link) In 1979, China Was Crushed in a War with Vietnam. What Happened Next Is Shocking. The Chinese may have achieved a diplomatic victory, as Ellerman suggests, but it appears that China was the overall loser militarily in the confrontation with Vietnam along their common border. Sino-Vietnamese War, 1979 Now, bear in mind, that was four decades ago. There will be no officers around with any experience in fighting any military conflict. Outside of a periodic border skirmishes with the Indians, they lack battlefield moxie. Remember, military protocol, strategy, and training is based on the wisdom of modern conflicts not on Sun Zhu.  I wonder where he earned all his ribbons and decorations\u2014party loyalty? Then look at weapons: the US. has a far bigger navy than China, with 500 vessels compared to China with 300 warships. When it comes to its air force, China has the world's second-largest fleet of jet fighters. The US is in first place with 2,800 jets to China's 1,500 jets. The US far outspends China when it comes to defense. Unlike the US, which has engaged in costly wars for decades without break, China hasn't seen a major conflict since a brief war with Vietnam in 1979. And unique from the U.S: China does not have any military allies to back up its ambitions where the US has many. We defeated the fourth largest army in the world in three weeks in the Gulf War (Iraq). We then defeated their military once again in 2003 in less than one month. 2003 invasion of Iraq - Wikipedia We turned out the Taliban from Afganistan to install a democratically elected government that is still in place. Yes\u2014they are still fighting the Taliban who hide in Pakistan who has funded and protected them since the start. Ideally, we would love to have to destroy the Taliban but since they hide in Pakistan, they are not many options except to accept that nuisance. The Pakistani ISA has long been a major supporter and has an interest in an unstable Afganistan. It is what it is. Now, we had to fight a guerilla resistance for years before we stabilized the government enough that they could defend their own sovereignty. It worked. They have their own military and we were able to withdraw. We are not occupiers or colonists. Now, let\u2019s go back and discuss battlefield experience. We are a warrior nation. We learned a long time ago that strength is measured in abilities...not in diplomatic rhetoric. England's Neville Chamberlain was the consummate diplomat in the 1930s, willing to take the enemy's reassurances because he wanted to believe that Hitler meant well and would be a man of his word. Unfortunately, we know how that turned out. Winston Churchill, a previous soldier who fought in the Boer Wars as a young man knew the enemy would only respect the sword...not words. We are a warrior nation that became a Super Power through our ability to back our efforts up with action. That is why there are 80 guns for every 100 US citizens. We love our guns. and we love to use them, We have spent most our history fighting. That\u2019s right\u2014the majority of our history of a nation. America Has Been at War 93% of the Time \u2013 222 out of 239 Years \u2013 Since 1776 - Global Research If I was to bet on a boxer for a professional bout in Las Vegas, I would definitely place my money on the one with the most experience and the most victories. Yes\u2014my boxer didn\u2019t win in Vietnam because his owner pulled him out of the ring but he only lost three battles out of several hundred (true count). His kill ratio was easily 6:1. But the politicians lost the will to continue the fight. I agree that the Chinese place little value on their citizen's lives and would fight to the last man or woman\u2026we look at the lives of our citizens totally differently than Asians. I know because We do place a far greater value on our lives. The Chinese just threw waves of men in charging positions in Korea with little regard for their welfare. Many had no weapons and would just pick up the weapon of the one fallen in front of him. That is quantity over quality. Asian views of lives and US are different. I viewed that serving in an infantry unit in Vietnam. We would risk our lives to extract our wounded buddies and I never saw the enemy do that once\u2014not once. The US has been planning large scale warfare for decades. We use a process called Scenario Planning to prepare. It uses various scenarios and statistical probabilities to prepare various alternatives. We also have a large arsenal of weapons (WMD) to produce the maximum damage. We also have Neutron Bombs which destroys lives without destroying structures. We have worked aggressively to prepare various means to destroy their carrier islands through a direct attack and tsunami-infliction methods. US warns of ability to take down Chinese artificial islands U.S. Has The Ability To 'Take Down' China's Man-Made Islands American-haters love to point out our flaws. Yes..Prosperity has had its downside with our obesity rates going up. That is the problem with being a rich and desirable nation. We love our fast food and it sticks to us. Prosperity has an ugly side. We are still number one in the world as the most desirable place to immigrate. We are not a perfect nation by any means and because we attract so many we also have our flaws. List of sovereign states and dependent territories by immigrant population - Wikipedia People keep saying, \u201cWell they haven\u2019t had to take on a big nation since WWII\u2026\u201d .Duh\u2026think about\u2026wonder why\u2026.duh!!!!??? One of the reasons we haven't had to fight a major player is, well look at this chart\u2026think about it. That is not bravado\u2026that is history.  Mike Tyson at age 53\u2014I wouldn\u2019t go up and insult him. He is planning a return to the ring..  Let\u2019s hope these two nations don\u2019t go to war. We are trading partners\u2014not friendly ones\u2026but dependent one. EDIT\u2026several of the respondents here seem to imply that China was exercising its legal rights to the South China Sea area. International Court in the Hauge ruled against China in 2016. The US is trying to preserve the sovereignty of the adjacent territories recognized by international law\u2026 Some of the America Bashers can always justify some rhetoric that either flies against US interdiction or supportive of Chinese expansion efforts. Under Cover of Pandemic, China Steps Up Brinkmanship in South China Sea Territorial Disputes in the South China Sea | Global Conflict Tracker A recent article shows China's build-up is more than defensive\u2026they are planning offensive activities.
