            "answer_text": "Not only can astronomers measure the distance of galaxies, they can measure how galaxies are moving. Galaxies are not holding still in space, nor are they moving randomly. Some galaxies are moving towards their neighbors, attracted by their mutual gravity. But the biggest pattern we see is that galaxies are moving apart from one another. This motion apart is not all at the same speed; instead it follows a pattern where galaxies that are further apart are moving more quickly. This particular pattern indicates the whole universe is expanding. To see why, consider a loaf of raisin bread. The raisins are like galaxies and the dough is like the fabric of space in the universe. As the dough rises, it carries the raisins along, pulling them apart from each other. Raisins that started out on opposite sides of the loaf will be a few inches farther apart after the dough rises, while raisins that started out near each other may only move half an inch. So, the speed of their motion is proportional to the separation between them. In the same way, the space of the universe pulls galaxies further apart as the universe expands. Astronomers detect a galaxy\u2019s motion by looking at its light spectrum. When a galaxy is carried away by the expansion of space, its light waves are stretched out, making it appear redder. The change in the galaxy\u2019s color is called the red shift, and can be used to calculate its velocity. From the measurements of many galaxies, astronomers can accurately measure the expansion rate of the universe as a whole. The age of universe can be determined by imaging what the universe looked like in the past, \u201crewinding\u201d the expansion. In the past the galaxies must have been closer together, and in the distant past they would have been packed together in a tiny point. If we assume that the expansion rate is constant over time, the age for the universe as a whole is about 10 billion years. However, astronomers have been working over the last 20 years to determine how the expansion rate changes with time. We now know that early in the universe the expansion was slowing down, but now it is speeding up. Using careful measurements of this change in expansion rate, the age of the universe is now known quite precisely to be 13.7\u00b10.13 billion years. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually the current data suggests 13.8 billion years old. How can we possibly know that? The answer comes from the dialog between theory and experiment. On the one hand, theoretical physicists have developed the Lambda-CDM model to describe the evolution of the universe. It consists of Dark Energy (the Lambda), cold dark matter (CDM), and the regular baryonic matter that everything visible is composed of, all within a general relativistic framework of an expanding Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker spacetime. The model predicts the general shape of the fluctuations in the Cosmic microwave background. On the other hand, experimental physicists have built state of the art satellites (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck) to measure the tiny fluctuations in the CMB. These measurements are extraordinarily sensitive, finding the temperature of space in every direction, sniffing out the oldest light in the cosmos. LCDM uses these measurements to pin down the numerical values of certain parameters in the model. These fitted parameters are then used to estimate derived parameters, one of which is the age of the Universe. In the image below the blue dots are experimental data on the CMB angular power spectrum, while the red line is the theoretical curve that best fits the data. It is the physicis that goes into making the prediction for that curve that also tells us the age of the universe.  You can read more about this here: CMB power spectra, likelihood, and cosmological parameters ",

            "answer_text": "The best available information indicates that the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years. Hubble has helped to measure the age of the universe using two different methods. The first method involves measuring the speeds and distances of galaxies. Because all of the galaxies in the universe are generally moving apart, we infer that they must all have been much closer together sometime in the past. Knowing the current speeds and distances to galaxies, coupled with the rate at which the universe is accelerating, allows us to calculate how long it took for them to reach their current locations. The answer is about 14 billion years. The second method involves measuring the ages of the oldest star clusters. Globular star clusters orbiting our Milky Way are the oldest objects we have found and a detailed analysis of the stars they contain tells us that they formed about 13 billion years ago. The good agreement between these two very different methods is an encouraging sign that we are honing in on the universe\u2019s true age. ",

            "answer_text": "It's based on the age of the oldest identified star in the visible sky.  The age of that star is determined by the quantity of heavier elements present inside it. That is predicted by using spectral analysis of the radiations coming form that star.  All elements give out radiations in a particular frequency when superheated. This distribution of which element radiates in which frequency is mapped to their corresponding element and is compared with that radiated from the star.  The intensity of light in that particular frequency determines what percentage of the element is present in the star.  We have a rough idea of how much of a certain heavier element is formed in a star and after what duration of time based on many models. Simply put, the presence of heavier elements other that hydrogen will say about the time the star has been undergoing fusion(of hydrogen) .  As most of us all know, as hydrogen gets  fused, helium fusion starts . Then comes lithium and such.... Hence,we can say how long the star has been burning based on the quantity of heavy elements present in it.  As we find older stars, the age of the universe will be correspondingly increased as well ",

Using the most recent data they have from a variety of sources and  applying the best astronomical and physics theories, they calculate what the age would be if all the theories  are correct.   When new and better theories emerge, and new data are obtained, they will run the numbers again, using the new theories, and arrive at a new estimate which may be the same, different, or with a narrower range of uncertainty.  Over the last 30 years or so this estimate has changed several times, by as much as a billion years or more. This does not mean they are guessing.  They are applying the best human understanding (theories) with the best data available to arrive at the best estimate anyone can make until knowledge improves. Other responses will probably describe how the data is obtained, what the theories are and how the estimates are calculated.  I look forward to learning from them. ",
