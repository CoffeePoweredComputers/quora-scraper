            "answer_text": "Diamond\u2019s book is brilliant. Possibly wrong, but brilliant. More likely, he is mostly right but wrong in some details. Your details are not relevant to his argument. He doesn\u2019t say that plants don\u2019t make a complete protein. he says that there was a greater variety of crops in Eurasia than elsewhere. The fact that Europe had the black death actually helps his argument \u2026 by the time the cultures met, Europeans were immune to a lot of stuff that others were not immune to. No one denies that north south travel exists. Travel was easier in much of Eurasia for a lot of reasons. No one denies that the Americans had civilizations. But their civilizations did not have guns or steel and were susceptible to more diseases. Of course the natives of the new world ate. But there was a greater variety of food, and more surplus food, in Europe. There are sensible ways to critique Diamond. But these are not the ways. ",

For the most part no, they're actually pretty straight forward and logical, although I don't like how he portrays technological advancement as if it was a Civ 5 tech tree, inventions and technological progress aren't predestined to always be the way they came about in Europe, for instance the Aztecs had the most urban and densely populated and geographically large city in the WORLD for a few hundred years, with sewer systems and road systems. they may not have had guns but I would love to see the Europeans be as good as irrigating and agriculturalizing 60 degree mountain cliffs like the Inca could. and as for true/accuracy I'd say he is 90% spot on, I personally don't like how he throws the word \u201cEurasia\u201d around so much without clarifying exactly where he is talking about since Eurasia is huge, but other than that I really don't think he has made many or huge mistakes in his analysis.

Now David Brion Davis is one of the Titans of Modern American History and is considered the world expert on the history of slavery. I doubt there are many history/geography/anthropology populisers that David Brion Davis would cite, but he cited Jared Diamond. So he at least of the main stream, heavy weight, academic community respects Jared Diamonds scholarship.
