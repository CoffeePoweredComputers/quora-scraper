            "answer_text": " The Battle of Poitiers Going out on a limb here and assuming you mean \u201cduring medieval times\u201d, because pretty much after this point, kings stopped dirtying their fingers with actual fighting. As has been pointed out (accurately) in my answers so far, kings would usually wade into battle surrounded by a guard of some sort\u2014 this is a tradition that goes back to biblical times. Royal Guards of various sorts were picked men, usually trained to do just that job, usually armed well and paid a form of stipend above and beyond feudal loyalty, and often barracked close to the king so they didn\u2019t get ideas. Various \u201cguard\u201d regiments in later militaries started out this way\u2014 a core element to protect the sovereign. Final note: Some of the more wily later medieval kings (from the 11th century onward) would dress identically to the King\u2019s guard, maybe with a unique crown attachment, so they couldn\u2019t be picked off easily by long ranged archer fire. See the French king Jean II at the Battle of Poitiers. He was dressed identically to a picked set of knights acting as his guard and only recognizable close up due to his headdress, which must have confused the English who were out there hunting for royal hostages. It took a local knight on the English side (from Artois) to recognize him and take him hostage. As the size and scale of battles increased with technology, it took a lot of work to manage them, and for the sake of victory participants couldn\u2019t afford to risk their command units by throwing them into the scrum. So having the king pick up a sword and swing away became increasingly rare after medieval times. ",

            "answer_text": "Most kings did not fight on the front lines with regular soldiers unless it was extremely necessary or the king was making a last stand against some prevailing enemy forces. Still, history is laden with many examples where kings have fought along with their army. Considering instances where the king fought in a battle, he was usually surrounded by an elite guard comprising of his best soldiers. To put the king in the line of fire it was necessary to annihilate his best soldiers. A high casualty affair for enemy soldiers because the king's elite regiment used to be one of the best trained and well equipped unit. The same troops were also responsible for protecting the palace and other royal institutions. Not to forget, the king's armor and other protection gear was more thick, sturdy and heavy than regular soldiers. Presence of the king on a battlefield was primarily for the sake of boosting morale of his troops rather than his active involvement in a skirmish. ",
