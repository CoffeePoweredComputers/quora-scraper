            "answer_text": "Oil is a global market. The U.S. government does not steal or buy oil from the Middle East. The government buys finished products, lubricating oil, jet fuel, etc through contracts. The U.S. government does not own or operate any refineries anywhere in the world. The U.S. Government does not own any tankers or railroads to ship the oil from one place to another. Oil is traded for money (in U.S. Dollars) by traders located world wide that usually never even see the oil that they are buying and selling. That oil is shipped via tankers, pipelines, rail cars, and trucks to wherever the oil trader may make a profitable sale, less shipping costs which are paid to the shipping company(owners of the tankers, pipelines, rail cars, and trucks). It is not at all unusual for oil to be traded multiple times from the time it is produced until it arrives at a refinery. What the U.S. government does, via it\u2019s military reach, is to ensure that those global markets remain stable and do not fluctuate wildly in the event of some terror attack on a tanker, oil field, or refinery. To wit, President Trump authorized oil to be drawn from the strategic petroleum reserve \u201cif needed\u201d to calm jittery oil markets in the wake of the attack on the Saudi Refinery. This immediately settled the markets and it soon became clear that no long term shortage would occur. No oil was withdrawn for this purpose, just saying it would be was enough. The Strategic Petroleum reserve does make occasional trades in it\u2019s oil holdings due to the interference of Congress in laws they pass. The theory Congress operates on seems to be \u201cBuy High and Sell Low\u201d. So the U.S. Government\u2019s role is not to \u201csteal\u201d any country\u2019s oil. It is however, through it\u2019s military presence, restricting some sales from the market (Iran) and has a role in determining the ownership and profits of some oilfields such as the one in Syria by not allowing Assad access to what was once one of his major profit centers before it fell into ISIS control.

            "answer_text": "No, the US is not stealing oil from the Middle East, it is buying it, and it is paying the OPEC price to the oil producing countries in the Middle East. At this point in time, due the magic of hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) the US is producing more of its own oil cheaper than it can buy it from OPEC, so American oil production is reaching an all-time high. It can also buy oil from Canada at a discount to OPEC prices, since Canadian production of heavy oil from its oil sands (\u201ctar sands\u201d) is also rising and Canadian oil companies are willing to undercut OPEC prices to make sales. Canadian oil is backing Middle Eastern oil out of the US market and Canada now accounts for over 1/3 of America\u2019s falling oil imports, more than all the Middle Eastern countries combined. Between American \u201cfracking\u201d and Canadian \u201ctar sands\u201d, North America is approaching continental oil self-sufficiency. This is causing a lot of problems for Middle Eastern oil producing countries because they no longer have the US over a barrel for oil supply. Both the price and the US demand for their oil is falling, and they really need the US money to finance the lavish spending style their ruling classes have gotten used to. ",

            "answer_text": "The oil in the Middle East, produced by the OPEC nations, are sold on the open market. The US buys a fair amount of that oil, and pays market prices. While the US is a net exporter of Petroleum products, it also buys on the open market looking for delivery to certain ports, and for certain grades of petroleum. While there are those that state that the US should go into the MIddle East and steal oil, the reality is that historically, all the US has wanted is continued guaranteed access to buy the oil at market prices. In order to achieve this, the US has worked with nations in the Middle East to make that happen. Even the invasion of Iraq, which truly was significantly about oil, was about access to that oil. The multi-national oil companies (not the US government) wanted to be able to develop and extract the resource. But it was never about \u201cstealing.\u201d ",

Some of these companies have been purchased back by the nations that they originally worked with.  For example,  Saudi Aramco was originally part of Standard of California Oil, which became Standard Oil, which was purchased by Exxon.  The Saudi government bought back the original piece by about 1980 and moved the head offices back in 1988. Every barrel of oil was paid for.  Sometimes, the negotiated rates were better than the world price but that is negotiation, not stealing. The US government is not in the oil business. ",

Such companies could of course engage in bribery and environmental destruction as local companies and rivals did, but that is another issue. ",

And what do the Middle East governments do with all the USD they get from selling their oil? They buy goods and services from the US, invest or loan it back to the US. Just check how much money Middle Eastern governments have invested in the US. From Wall Street to the Silicone Valley. We don't need to steal their oil. We just need to make sure the oil producing countries are ruled by people who are friendly towards our interests. ",
