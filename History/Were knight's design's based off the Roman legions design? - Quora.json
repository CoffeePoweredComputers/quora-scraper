            "answer_text": "No they weren't. And I don't think a knight looks much of anything like a legionary either. What the knight is based on is a paradigm in warfare that required armoured impact cavalry, combined with a socio-economic paradigm where society was effectively governed by the exchange of land for military service. what the knight was partially influenced by, was the Cataphract cavalry of the Roman Empire in the east, but the role and equipment was somewhat different all the same. The kind of legionary you are on about is nothing to do with the medieval knight. ",

            "answer_text": "The roman empire lasted a long time. Early roman soldiers look nothing like any kind of knight, fighting much in the same way as a greek hoplite.  However, late Roman soldiers (I will only count the western Roman empire for simplicities sake) look very different.  which is not all to different from the early knights of western europe  And that is very simply because the gear of the knight is a derivative of that of the late Roman soldier.
