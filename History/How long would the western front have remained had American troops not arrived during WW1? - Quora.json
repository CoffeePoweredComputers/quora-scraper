            "answer_text": "If the planned German Spring Offensive did not succeed, WWI would have ended the same way majority of wars in Europe during that time did: via some kind of settlement among the combatants sometime around 1919 or 1920. By that time, everyone almost had nothing to throw into the fray anymore. Instead of reading about WWI and the Treaty of Versailles, we would be reading something about a massive European war during 1914-1919/1920 or so which ended in a stalemate or some kind of peace treaty and territorial exchanges (or something happening to Serbia, hey a terrorist group sponsored by them started the mess that would become WWI and with no Russian Empire around to protect them it might not be something good). Although by the time it's over, UK, France, Italy and Germany would probably be the ones left standing with the Austro-Hungarian Empire fragmenting due to domestic problems. ",

            "answer_text": "Not mentioned in any of the other answers was the state of the British economy. In a book about antisubmarine warfare, I read that the British refused to assign destroyers to convoy duty, on the belief that they were warships and had to be kept ready to fight the German High Seas Fleet (which never came out after Jutland). When the American representative showed up in spring 1917, the British First Lord of the Admiralty told him that Britain had about six weeks of food left for its civilian population. The Americans convinced them to use destroyers to protect merchantmen from U-Boats, and the US eventually created and deployed a field army in Europe. ",
