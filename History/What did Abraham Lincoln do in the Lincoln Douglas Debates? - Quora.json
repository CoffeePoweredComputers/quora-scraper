            "answer_text": "Abraham Lincoln\u2019s skills as a raconteur transformed him into a formidable political opponent, one that his adversaries underestimated at their peril. His persona as a humble country lawyer could not mask his ambition. The Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858 provided a national showcase for the future president\u2019s talents. Like many politicians of his day, Lincoln seasoned his speeches with masterfully told stories. The endearing tales served their purpose; they engaged his audience and highlighted important points.

This Reminds Me of a Little Joke | Print | Wisconsin Historical Society His jokes, however, can be lifted from his speech and appreciated on their own. Among Lincoln\u2019s oft-told jokes, the story of the preacher and the perfect woman remains my favorite. The President told of a southern Illinois preacher who, in the course of his sermon, asserted that the Savior was the only perfect man who had ever appeared in this world; also that there was no record, in the Bible or elsewhere, of any perfect woman having lived upon the earth. Whereupon there arose in the rear of the church a persecuted-looking personage who, the parson having stopped speaking, said \"I know a perfect woman, and I\u2019ve heard of her every day for the last six years.\u2019\" \"Who was she?\" asked the minister. \"My husband\u2019s first wife,\" replied the afflicted female. \u2014 Story relayed by soldier-turned-publisher James Grant Wilson (1832-1914)[1] In an age where oratory and rhetorical prowess were highly prized, the ability to enrapture an audience was viewed with reverence. Journalists of the nineteenth century frequently reprinted political speeches, accompanied with commentary on the speaker\u2019s demeanor, skill, and listeners\u2019 reaction to each verbal thrust and parry. In this respect, the future president stood out among his fellow legislators in Illinois. With an audience roaring in laughter and hanging on his every word, his opponents soon realized that Lincoln\u2019s affable nature concealed an excellent debater. During all seven of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, observers noticed Lincoln\u2019s skills against Stephen Douglas, a masterful debater in his own right.[2] Even friends of Douglas grew concerned as they watched the debates unfold. The manner in which he would tax \u2018my friend Judge Douglas\u2019 with a troublesome question, or answer him humorously with \u2018that reminds of a story,\u2019 or some other telling form of repartee, all resulting in tremendous laughter and applause, however it may affected Mr. Douglas certainly worried me very much.[3] These ribbons of humor woven through the debates did more than set Douglas back on his rhetorical heels. The captivating stories were a tool to carry his audience to his unavoidable conclusion: slavery was a stain on the United States, a pestilence that the country must overcome. Though he did not consider African-Americans equal to whites, he saw the institution of slavery in moral terms. That is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent. It is the eternal struggle between these two principles -- right and wrong -- throughout the world. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time, and will ever continue to struggle. The one is the common right of humanity and the other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself. It is the same spirit that says, \"You work and toil and earn bread, and I'll eat it.\" No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle. -- October 15, 1858 debate at Alton, Illinois.[4] Over one hundred and fifty years later, Lincoln\u2019s verbal dexterity still leaps off the page. I have searched in vain for modern-day equivalents in today\u2019s politics, but I have yet to find them.  \u201cEvery one of his stories seemed like a whack upon my back\u2026 Nothing else - not any of his arguments or any of his replies to my questions - disturbs me. But when he begins to tell a story, I feel that I am to be overmatched.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Douglas, on his famous debates with Lincoln.[5] Footnotes[1] Lincoln's Own Stories[2] Lincoln-Douglas debates | Summary, Dates, Significance, & Facts[3] Lincoln's Sense of Humor[4] Slavery Quotations by Abraham Lincoln[5] Abe Lincoln's Legacy of Laughter",

            "answer_text": "First you must remember that at this time in our history the respective state legislatures elected their states US Senators. So these debates were a part of the political campaign process to try to convince people to support the state legislatures that supported them. Lincoln was largely unknown outside of Illinois having severed in the Illinois state house and 1 term as representative in the US Congress. It was during one of these debates (there were a total of 5 or 6 debates that were held in various parts of the state) were Lincoln made his argument against slavery in what came to be known as his House Divided speech. This series of debates took place after 2 other significant events that directly impacted on the slavery issue. The Dred Scott decision and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The Dred Scott decision involved a slave named Dred Scott who moved to a free state with his master and they lived their for a number of years. His master returned to a slave state but Dred Scott refused to go with him claiming that being brought into a free state and living their for a number of years made him a free person. His master took him to court claiming he was still his property. The case went to the Supreme Court and was decided in the owners flavor, the majority opinion written by Chief Justice Taney a pro slavery person. Lincoln considered this decision to be one of the worst in court history with its practical implication being that it made slavery legal everywhere. The Missouri Compromise was a compromise that restricted what new territories and states could be slave and which would be free. Stephen Douglas helped lead the effort to repeal the Compromise arguing that each new state should be able to decide for itself. Lincoln believed that slavery would die a natural death from the weight of its own economics and advancement in technology. As the slave population continued to increase the economic burden to slaveholders grew. Slavery could only remain a viable institution by increasing the area that allowed slavery, where current slaveholders would have a market for their excessive slaves. The Dred Scott decision and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise destroyed the efforts of the anti slavery movement to contain slavery. These events are what in part inspired Lincoln to run against Douglas for the US Senate. While he lost to Douglas his Hose Divided speech brought him national attention and national support of the anti slavery movement in the north. This directly influenced his winning the Republican nomination at the Convention in Chicago. ",
