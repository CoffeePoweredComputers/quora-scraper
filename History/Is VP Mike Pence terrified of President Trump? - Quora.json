            "answer_text": "Cowed would be a better word than terrified. Pence had won a tight race as governor in 2012 and had low approval numbers coming into his 2016 reelection campaign. His policies based on very conservative Christian ideology had been criticised by many. Given that he accepted to become Trump\u2019s running mate Trump was the underdog and in many ways was very much against the values Pence claimed. So he must have felt his reelection prospects were pretty bad. His gamble paid off and Pence seems to have played the perfect Trump VP so far, discreet and almost fawning. Unlike cabinet positions with actual power Pence is less likely to have to contradict or oppose Trump so his position is more secure than the others\u2019. So what does he have to fear? Unlike appointees Pence can\u2019t be fired so his position is secure until January 2021. The worst possibility is that Trump might want a new running mate. And if he does Pence political career may well be over. The primaries are over and there is no open race for him to enter so late in the election cycle. A senate election will occur in Indiana in 2022 but he\u2019ll have to oust incumbent fellow Republican Toss Young unless the latter decides not to run for that position again. All other options available that year would be a step down for Pence. And by 2024 he probably will have been forgotten. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of charisma so he would have difficulty staying in the public eye for four years like Sarah Palin, despite all her flaws, managed to. Even Trump supporters are unlikely to feel enthusiastic about him. Those love Trump\u2019s brashness and offensiveness. And anyway they are from a dwindling demographic. And to the rest of voters he\u2019ll carry the stench of his association with Trump. All his hopes rest on staying as running mate and Trump winning again. I see no other bright future for him. And while there is talk of Trump changing mate he might find it difficult to find someone better than Pence. If you\u2019re an up and coming politician who wants to use the vice-presidency as a stepping stone. Trump has been very divisive and good VP candidates might be hesitant, especially given how difficult working with Trump has been shown to be. And if you want visibility through a stint as VP there\u2019s the fact that Trump doesn\u2019t share the limelight. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Pence is Trump\u2019s handler. If anything Trump fears Pence. It wasn\u2019t until Trump named Pence his running mate that the party (enough at least) went all in on Trump. You may notice Trump changing his tune a little bit once Pence came aboard. E.g. Trump began using terrorism as a bigger talking point. Trump eased off his trash talk of anyone in the Bush family. (Remember he accused Bush of lying about WMDs and knowing about 9/11 beforehand? Wow! You\u2019ll never hear Trump say that again.) Trump going \u201coff the rails\u201d imho can feel a little scripted. But Pence is the guy who accused John Ashcroft of being a terrorist for disputing Pence\u2019s claim (which Pence knew was a lie) that Saddam Hussein was sending \u201csuper anthrax\u201d to the USA after 9/11. Yeah, remember anthrax? Mike Pence was on the anthrax task force. Funny how they never mention that as a qualification for being on the 2020 task force, isn\u2019t it. ",
