            "answer_text": "There have been at least eight treaties of Versailles: in 1756, 1757, 1758, 1768, 1783, 1787, 1871, and 1919. Versailles was the main palace used by the Kings of France, and even after the monarchy was abolished it remained a huge, luxurious building with plenty of space inside for hosting international conferences. As such, it was the natural place to hold negotiations between France and other countries, and many treaties were signed there. There have also been over 40 Treaties of Paris (or Conventions of Paris, or Paris Peace Accords, or similar names.) ",
