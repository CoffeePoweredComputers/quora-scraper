            "answer_text": " stephenhicks.org/ To understand the 1940 Tripartite Act which created the Axis powers, one has to go deeper into Japanese-German relations. First, I think it is important to note that modern Japan and Germany are fairly similar. Germany only became a country in 1871. Before that, it was a multitude of countries and city-states. After defeating France in the Franco-Prussian war, Prussia united all the areas to make the Empire of Germany. A formerly weaker power now strutted upon the world stage as a real game changer in Europe. Japan had a very similar rise. When Japan was forced out of isolation in 1854, it began a period of rapid westernization. And we have already chronicled the coming-out party that was theRusso-Japanese war. So, we have two formerly weak and isolated powers that now have come into their own and have shown the world that they are a force to be reckoned with. Early Relations After ending isolation, Japan had a very friendly relationship with Prussia (which would later come to be Germany), and Prussia was modernizing with typical German efficiency and speed. Japan saw their progress and decided to bring direct influence from them to hopefully modernize in a similar way. So, Japan hired many Prussians and later Germans to come to Japan as advisors to aid them in modernizing. These would be known as the \u201coyatioi gaikokujin\u201d. Think of Tom Cruise\u2019s role inThe Last Samurai, and you\u2019re on the right track. If you go to a school in Japan today, it is still based on the old Prussian system. Look at the school uniforms. For the most part, there are military dress uniforms for boys and sailor uniforms for girls. Everything in Prussian society was about creating Europe\u2019s greatest fighting force, which it did in spades. This militaristic approach helped streamline everything to aid in faster modernization. These German advisors helped form Japan\u2019s constitution and military. It\u2019s almost like Japan was Germany\u2019s little brother. But the relationship would sour. World War One  upload.wikimedia.org/ There is an easy way to understand Japan and Germany\u2019s relationship up to this point. Let\u2019s compare their situation to the friendship of Michael Jackson and The Beatles founder Paul McCartney. They were very different musicians, but two of the greatest of all time. They were different races but realized that they had a lot to learn from each other. The two really inspired each other, but their relationship fell apart because of business. When The Beatles songs\u2019 rights were up for grabs, Paul McCartney was scrambling for cash so he could own the rights to his own life\u2019s work, and right as he was going to get them they were snatched up by none other than his great friend Michael Jackson. When Paul McCartney confronted his friend about this backstabbing, Michael Jackson merely shrugged and said, \u201cThat\u2019s business.\u201d That\u2019s how it was for Germany and Japan as well. As a new imperial nation, Germany knew it had to do what all the other cool kids were doing \u2013 it had to establish foreign colonies. Germany is in a very delicate position in Europe. It is surrounded by other powerful neighbors and has few natural resources. So, having colonies abroad would help to stabilize things at home. Germany arrived at the tail end of the Age of Exploration. All of the good spots had been taken. One of the only areas of the world that wasn\u2019t entirely owned by other European powers was Asia. So Germany started to acquire different spots in Asia. Imperial Japan thought in very much the same terms of the European powers and also wanted colonies. They saw their natural zone of influence in much of East Asia. So when Germany came trouncing in and claiming stuff, for the Japanese it was like some guy bursting into your backyard and saying parts of it were his. So, Japan started making friends with Great Britain, and the blossoming German partnership largely cooled. Finally, after the outbreak of World War One, Japan allied with Britain and the Allies and quickly took over those German Asian holdings, \u201cThat\u2019s [Imperial] business.\u201d Friendship out of Indignation  upload.wikimedia.org/ After World War One, Germany was in a really bad place. It was forced by the allies and the newly formed League of Nations to sign a terribly harsh treaty, which crashed the German government and economy, and this would ultimately be the cause for the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party. Japan was not a big fan of this League of Nations. To be completely honest, the league was quite unfair with Japan. They punished Japan for doing to its neighbors what the leaders of the League of Nations, Britain and France, consistently did with their colonies. Slaughter thousands of native tribesman in Africa? Perfectly okay if Britons did it in Africa, but Japan take over and create the state of Manchukuo (Manchuria)? Completely unacceptable! Japan could not deal with the League\u2019s apparently rank hypocrisy and quickly withdrew from the League. Hitler\u2019s Germany originally had strong ties with the Chinese government, but Hitler quickly saw that Japan was going to be the most strategic partner in Asia. Many people think of Hitler like a Bond villain in that he wanted to take over the entire world. That is not exactly true. Hitler\u2019s view was that the world should be controlled by the \u2018Great Powers\u2019. America would control the Americas, Great Britain would have her colonies in the Middle East and Africa, Germany would have its thousand-year Reich in central and Eastern Europe, and finally, Asia would be controlled by Japan. Japan, for her part, did want to continue to expand. It created the \u201cGreater East-Asian Prosperity\u201d sphere. But both Japan and Germany shared a common enemy in their ambitions for expansion; the Soviet Union. With common goals and a common adversary, and a long history of friendship and co-operation between the two powers, an alliance between the two seemed like common sense. Many Japanese leaders also felt that an alliance with Germany would isolate the aggression from America, although it would actually turn out to be quite the opposite. The Second World War and Beyond When war broke out between Germany and the allied forces of Europe in 1939, a short war was expected by both sides. Before 1941, the United States was technically neutral and Japan was not involved in the war in a military way, despite being strongly aligned with Germany. At this time the relationship between Germany and Japan was mutually beneficial, but not heavily intertwined. Indeed, Japan was more concerned with exerting its influence in East Asia and not further west than that. However, Japan made a sudden entrance into the conflict when it attacked Pearl Harbour in 1941, bringing both itself and the United States into the war. It is said that Hitler was particularly happy about this, feeling that Japan was a very strong and capable ally. From this point, Japan along with Germany, Italy, and smaller states, came together as more of one force. When Germany declared war on the United States as a response to them declaring war with Japan, this further strengthened the relationship. As the war went on and Germany and Japan began losing their strongholds across the world, trade and communication between the two countries deepened, with both countries becoming dependent on each other for valuable resources. When Germany surrendered to the Allied Forces in May 1945, Japan chose to see this surrender as an act of treason and made moves to distance themselves from Germany and its leaders. Japan soon had to also surrender when it was clear the Allies would be victorious. Since the war, relations have once again blossomed, focusing mainly on economic and business negotiations and trading relations. Nowadays, the two countries are friends and have very closely aligned ideas about the directions of their countries. Both seen as pioneers of technological advancements and high-quality electronics and industry standards, hopefully, they will continue to prosper. In Conclusion Japan\u2019s joining of the Tripartite Act was probably one of the greatest mistakes ever made by both Germany and Japan in their histories. For Japan, it led to greater enmity between itself and America which would lead to Pearl Harbor. Because the treaty stipulated that they had to show solidarity with each other, Germany was also forced to declare war on America, which almost certainly resulted in the destruction of the Thousand Year Reich and Japan\u2019s Empire.Why Did Japan Join Forces With Germany During World War II? \u2013 Japan Info ",

            "answer_text": "Short Answer: Japan wanted to expand. The Allies were in the way. It would make no sense to join them. What good would it do to join the allies against Germany when Japan already gained the German islands in the Pacific in WWI? Would make no sense to join the allies given the strategic framework of the Japanese leadership of the times. To the East was Ally #1\u2026Russia who blocked expanding west and Russia defeated them in battle in Mongolia. To the Southwest were Allies #2, #3 and #4\u2026raw material rich possessions of the Dutch, French and British that would make Japan strong. With the allies conquered or weakened by Hitler, the UK, Dutch and French could do little to prevent Japanese conquest. Only the US stood in the way (Ally #5). Japan needed the oil in Indonesia for its plans, especially after the US embargoed Japan after its behavior in China. Japan wanted to rule parts of China (Ally #6). The whole point was to succeed against the allies. If that is your strategic framework, which side would you choose? Strangely enough it would actually have been in Japan\u2019s long term interest to have joined the allies although this was not apparent to them at the time (how could it be?). They would have avoided the fire-bombing of their cities, the atomic bombs of two cities, the loss of many of their most dedicated men and the enmity of their neighbors which is not resolved to this day. Instead, Japan could have been one of the founding architects of the current global system and gotten what it was after\u2026namely access to raw materials and global markets with secure shipping lanes. Let\u2019s call it \u201cco-prosperity.\u201d It would have given Japan prestige, and perhaps even a permanent seat on the Security Council. It could have played a role earlier with the World Bank. It\u2019s economic influence in Asia is today well known. It\u2019s political and cultural prestige could have been equally strong. Japan would have greater influence in Taiwan than it does today. And it would have the respect of China and Korea. There would have been no tragic division of the Korean peninsula had Japan not chosen war with the Allies. Anyway\u2026the US and Japan quickly became friends after the war. My only question is how would militarism have been addressed if not by defeat. Let us hope wiser minds prevail today for all countries where we see tensions rising and short-term thinking at work. Like the Japanese who should have chosen the Allies, we cannot see so far into the future nor be so wise as to see all of the consequences of our actions today. Kumar has a far more magisterial treatment of this subject in another answer which includes the historical evolution and context. ",
