            "answer_text": "This question is about the evidence (ie verifiable, credible research) on MB having actually happened. It is not about faith/belief, philosophy or ancient tradition. Therefore please avoid comments on the teachings/ philosophy in MB/ Bhagwad Gita. The basic plot of the Mahabharata is taken from the Rig Vedic \u201cBattle of Ten Kings\u201d. The author/s of MB have used this event and added ideas from the RIg Veda along with some very creative writing. This event (BTK) has been dated by scholars to be between 14 to 10th C BC. This was a battle involving various tribes including the Bharata tribe. The winners were the Bharat tribe. Hence the name Mahabharata. Ref Battle of the Ten Kings - Wikipedia, Mahabharata Historicity by Prof. B B Lal https://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/article/download/782/769 The rest of it, is a romantic/ dramatic fictionalisation.. in modern times we see similar films under the genre \u201chistorical drama\u201d. As, historical dramas go, the Mahabharat also provides us rich information on prevailing kingdoms/ geography and society/ culture , class/ caste divisons. But the stories of fantastic weapons, humongous armies, superheroes , re-births and re-incarnations, advanced technology (nuclear, cloning/ surrogacy etc) are the imagination of the author/s. So we can give them full marks for their creativity but we cannot accept everything in the the story as \u201chistoricaL\u2019 I see a lot of posts on the internet (including on Quora) citing specific planetary configurations mentioned in the book, as proof that everything in the Mahabharat is gospel truth, but consider the following : Isaac Asimov has written the foundation trilogy in the 1940\u201360 time period. With the technology/ knowledge available to him, he has referred to numerous existing galaxies etc. If an alien civilisation were to discover Asimovs books a 1000 years from now they would tend to believe that because scientifically verifiable facts were present in the story, the story itself must be real. However we know that what Asimov wrote is a work of fiction. And so it is with the planetary configurations proof for the Mahabharata. They show that when the book was written (see Note 1) adequate knowledge of astronomy existed to mention specific planetary positions of the past, but they are not proof that all the events mentioned in the Mahabharat are factually true. Or to use another example>> One can today (in 2019) write a story set in 2026 in Delhi. It can mention existing places (like Rashtrapati Bhawan, parliament house etc) and past true events (like the Lok Sabha election of 2014) . The story goes on to say that in the year 2025, New Delhi was destroyed in a nuclear attack. Someone in Delhi reads the story in 2030 and he also sees that new Delhi has never suffered a nuclear attack and still exists as it did earlier. The story uses historically verifiable facts from 2019, but is the nuclear attack of 2025 true ? Now let us move to a 1000 years later (in 3019 AD), Delhi no longer exists, perhaps obliterated due to a natural disaster or abandoned due to pollution. Another person now reads the story in 3019. Since Delhi no longer exists , he will tend to believe that the nuclear attack mentioned in the story was a true event. But was it ? Or simpler still: Spiderman comics mention New york city. And New york city is real. So Spiderman must also be real. (Correction from Superman to Spiderman as suggested by Bhavya Nayyar) . Or closer home Shaktimaan (TV serial from Doordarshan) has many references to existing Indian cities and places. Therefore Shaktimaan is real. So just because one (or few) verifiable facts are mentioned in a story, it does not make everything else in the story also a historical / scientific fact. Similar is the case with the findings of the submerged Dwarka city. What they tell us is that the writer/s of the Mahabharata were aware of these events (of flooding) , but again they are not proof that all the fantastic events described in the Mahabharata actually occurred. Several answers here have shared pictures of the submerged city, claiming that the city was submerged around 3000 BC .. around the same date that is used to date the MB battle using the planetary positions..ie 3126 BC. Most of those pictures are fake. They are from other submerged locations and not from Dwarka. The National oceanographic Institute located in Goa has dated these submerged ruins to to 1500 BC. So we can say that the Mahabharata is a story written around an event which happened. But to say that the specific events, stories of advanced weapons, and all the fantsastical people mentioned in the Mahabharata are \u201chistorical\u201d is a bit juvenile. (Similar stories , of battles in which the gods were also involved, are also available in Greek , Roman , Viking and Chinese mythology. I wonder is there is a debate in Europe and china, on whether they are history or mythology.) A modern comparison could be the films like Ashoka, Jodha Akbar, Mughal e Azaam, Bajirao Mastani. All are based on historical events, but all the events in the film are not exactly historical record. Note 1: Many scholars have expressed the opinion that the Mahabharat as known now is actually an extended version of the older (and shorter) book \u201cJaya\u201d with 8800 verse, composed around 4C BC. With the passage of time , stories were added to the original (or core) till 4 C AD leading to what we now see as Mahabharat (with 100,000 verses) was created. It is possible that the astronomical references were added only in these later extensions. Also, knowledge of astronomy in India has existed since 12th C BC. Edit 1 For a related discussion please see Ajay Joshi's post in Random by design Edit 2 Some of the most-read/ most popular answers to this question have used astronomical calculations, the submerged city of Dwarka and references to Tamil Sangam literature to \u201cprove\u201d that all the Mahabharata events are historically true. I find that in each of the evidences offered in support there is either a flaw in the logic or in the reference itself. I have put my queries to the people who have answered. So far there is no response. Edit 3 Consider this : The Pandava army was 7 akshauhini strong, while Kaurava was 11 akshauhini strong. This means , the following were present on the battlefield: Foot soldiers 19, 68,300 nearly 20 lacs Horses 1,172,880 ie nearly 12 lac horses with 12 lac soldiers mounted on them Elephants 2,62,440 with at least one soldier and one mahout. Chariots 2,62,440 with at least one soldier and one charioteer Thats a total of 44 lac men ..more than the combined army strength of todays India, China USA and Pakistan. Plus the horses and elephants. Does it look like a true historical record ? Or consider this >> In the 7th chapter of Bhisma Parva, this shloka appears.( No 9 ) << \u0101dityataru\u1e47\u0101bh\u0101so vidh\u016bma iva p\u0101vaka\u1e25yojan\u0101n\u0101\u1e43 sahasr\u0101\u1e47i \u1e63o\u1e0da\u015b\u0101dha\u1e25 kila sm\u1e5bta\u1e25>>The translation is >>> mountain called Meru made of gold. Effulgent as the morning sun, it is like fire without smoke. It is eighty-four thousand Yojanas high, and, O king, its depth also is eighty-four Yojanas.>> The lowest agreed measurement of Yojana is 8 km. So 84,000 yojana would be 6,72,000 km. That would make this mountain 50 times the size of the Earth. Mahabharat has dozens of exaggerations like this. Makes it difficult to accept it as historical record. ",

            "answer_text": "You can try the answer against the background of about 175 flood myths available in other cultures! [Myths are truths conveyed in story-setting] All of them say forces of nature destroyed a morally depraved world, and a new world started thereafter with a few people. Prominent among them is the Bible that says after the dissolution (through flood) the new world started with 8 persons. In India it says a wicked world ended with Mahabharat War in which weapons of mass-destruction were lavishly used with cataclysmic effects, and new system of things started thereafter. Yet beneath the details, both West and East scriptures give this implied truth: An OLD WORLD ORDER that became extremely decadent was destroyed through some means, and A NEW WORLD ORDER was brought in. 1)\tAccording to Septuagint Bible [Old Testament that was in use at the time of Jesus], ancient world ended and a new world started in the year in 3134 BC (CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Deluge of Catholic Encyclopedia; 2 Peter 2:5; 3:5-7) Interestingly, this ancient Bible account of a global flood is common to three major religions\u2014Jews, Christians and Muslims. Parallel secular history of Sumerian Kings list that begins immediately after the Flood \u201csuggests a Flood date close to 3000 BC.\u201d In contrast, books that support theory of evolution may claim that history is linear and millions of years old which they say depending on dating methods such as Carbon-14. But carbon dating has its problem. Its results vary according to the objects that are made subject to it. It may show the shell of a living freshwater mussel to be aged over two thousand years, and coal, oil, and natural gas that are supposed to be millions of years old may show as aged in the tens of thousands of years. Problems are many with this carbon dating method. One among is that C-14 is forming today faster than it's decaying. And another problem is that earth's magnetic field is decaying exponentially which would affect influx of cosmic rays, which in turn affect C-14 formation rates also. Willard Libby, who invented the C14 dating method to determine the age of biological materials by measuring their carbon-14 activity, found that this method has proven somewhat accurate back to only about 2000 BC, and wrote \u201cthat history extended back only 5000 years.\u201d (Libby 1958: 531) (Associates for Biblical Research). 2)\tIn India it is taught that each Kalpa (cycle of 5000 years) ends with Mahabharat War and a Golden Age would start thereafter. (Bhagavat Gita 4:7) Aryabhatta, the great mathematician and astronomer of India in the 5th century CE, examined the astronomical positions recorded in the Mahabharat, and wrote in his work, the Aryabhattiya, that the approximate date for previous Mahabharat war to be 3100 BCE. [This may be the strongest evidence] 3)\tInscription found in the Jain Temple at Aihole prepared by Chalukya King Pulakeshi says that the temple was constructed 3735 years after the Mhabharat War, and 556 years of Saka Era. (Today Saka Era is 1939 while Christian era is 2017). Hence (1939 - 556 = 1383) 1383 years ago the temple was constructed. 1383 years backward from the present year of 2017, we reach 634 AD which is the year of inscribing this. That means in 634 AD, 3735 years had passed from the Mhabharat War. So the date of the Mahabharat War comes (3735 \u2013 634) to 3101 BC. (Meguti Jain temple of Aihole - Jain Glory - was an era ...; http://www.kerurtown.gov.in/tourism) 4)\tDr. E. Vedavyas who surveyed the researches on astronomical dating of Mahabharat done by 120 scholars over the past hundred years, says sixty-one of them fixed the Mahabharat war to have occurred between 3000 and 3200 B.C. (Astronomical Dating of the Mahabharat War, written by . Dr. E Vedavyas, Agam Kala Prakashan, Delhi) Thus, all the above references show that previous Kalpa ended around 5000 years ago. Going for earlier date would not make sense; because population almost doubles about 50 years [projected world population for the year 2026 is 8 Billion; it was 4 Billion in 1974, and 2 Billion in 1927, according to United States Census Bureau]. If we make a chart backward like 1 Billion in 1874, \u00bd Billion in 1827 \u2026. you will very soon reach the number of population as just two in less than a few thousand years! Thus all evidence points to the fact that the present Kalpa is very close to its expiry date [which is also confirmed by such major threats such as climate change, sea-level rise, accelerated rate of species becoming extinct, increasing number of countries developing nuclear weapons \u2026etc.]. It will end in combined events of 3rd World War, civil wars and natural calamities, following which the next cycle of 5000 years will start with Golden Age as its first phase.
