At that time, her age will also be 3 times her present age, so it will be 3 * X. Since her age at that time will be 3 * X and X + 16, one may write : 3 * X = X + 16 Or : 2 * X = 16 Or : X = 8 The girl's age is 8 now. ",

            "answer_text": "This can be answered using a simple Linear equation. Let the variable representing the girl\u2019s present age be defined as \u2018x\u2019 In 16 years, the girls age will be \u2018x+16\u2019 In 16 years she will be 3 times as old as her present age and so x + 16 is equal to 3 times her present age or \u20183x\u2019 So writing this mathematically: x+16=3x Then Solve x + 16 = 3x 16 = 3x - x 16 = 2x 16/2 = x 8 = x x = 8. Because x represents the present age of the girl, the girl\u2019s age now is 8 years old. ",
