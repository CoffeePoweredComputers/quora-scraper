            "answer_text": "The benefits were social (status) rather than financial. Knights formed a distinct social class bound by a common code of honor known as chivalry. (For more on chivalry see: Helena Schrader's answer to Were knights chivalrous?)  When a man was knighted, he was NOT automatically given a fief. In the early 12th century particularly, this led to a large number of young men \u2014 fully trained as cavalry men, and technically raised to knighthood \u2014 but lacking employment and income. The term \u201cfree lance\u201d refers to this class of men, men trained to arms and raised to the status of knight, but not attached to a specific lord. It was not a desirable status, as a knight could not long maintain his status long without a source of income. He needed income to finance his horses, pay a squire, and maintain his armor. Without horses, arms and armor, he might technically be a knight, but he could not perform as one. In consequence, knights without fixed employment were little better than mercenaries.  In fact, however, most knights did find fixed employment. Either they attached to the household of a noblemen or a wealthy knight or even a bishop or abbot. They earned their keep (usually a place to sleep, meals, stabling and feed for their horses, and specific items of clothing) in exchange for serving their lord.  Loyal service to a lord could be rewarded with a good marriage or a fief if one became vacant or was acquired through conquest in frontier regions (e.g. Spain, the Holy Land). Or loyal service might lead to a lucrative and respected position as a household official, e.g. a constable or steward at one of the lord\u2019s several residences.  A land-owning knight was of higher status than a household knight. He was able to live on his own, marry and found a family/dynasty. Landowning knights were the backbone of the judiciary and also the executors of the law as sheriffs etc.  ",

            "answer_text": "The privileges available to knights obviously varied over time, since medieval history and the relationship between knight and lord itself changed. But in the most general of answers, the knight would typically be granted (or at least promised) to some land holdings to support his lifestyle as a military service provider to his lord- the knight was originally a follower of a lord that provided himself and some men to fight. In \u201cbastard feudalism\u201d this slightly changed form actual service to payment in kind, ie you pay your lord the amount of money and resources necessary for him to obtain that service from somewhere or someone else, ie mercenaries. This became particularly important as knights evolved from armoured cavalrymen to landholders that had to function as administrators of those holdings- hard to do when you have to spend time training to fight, then actually going away for months to fight. Why do that when you can just pay someone to do it on your behalf? So that is the most fundamental and basic privilege of a knighted person- a very different type of work than the commoner that had to make products or till the field. Luckily most knights tended to have the upbringing for this sort of job, or at least served as squires in a form of apprenticeship prior to being knighted. Particulars varied of course, but land holding was most significant. ",
