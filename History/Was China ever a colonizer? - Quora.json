            "answer_text": "  Beginning from a single river valley, the Chinese took over a continent through cultural expansion and repeated military force, over centuries. Their colonization is rather similar to the Romans or Frankish or Americans, but more extensive in terms of time, space, and culture, but not really religion. The Chinese are arguably the most successful colonizers of all time, in part because they have so totally absorbed, displaced, or pacified groups which resisted them for centuries and millennia, like the Miao, the Yue, and the Mongolians. Discussing modern colonialist behavior is a lot more controversial, but I\u2019m generally of the opinion that people throw the word around too easily in describing modern China, such as when talking about China\u2019s involvement in Africa or Pakistan, and not nearly enough in describing historical China. That said, Tibet and Xinjiang are also inarguably colonial efforts, though the west has done exactly the same and worse things in our own contexts and there\u2019s nothing to be done and blah blah. It is colonialism. What else do you call a military occupation and extremely intense control of speech, education, and assembly, to make the locals fit the language, behavior, worldview and (lack of) religion of the ruling ethnicity? Those two efforts are also among the most successful modern colonial attempts in history, as the separatist movements have been almost completely discredited and most locals in both regions seem to have come to a pretty accepting modus vivendi, and any violent resistance is essentially retaliation rather than actually an attempt to seek a state or incite ethnic separation. Compare this state of affairs to comparable separatist movements in, say, Russian Dagestan and Chechnya, which have managed to stay active in spite of heavy soft and hard state pressure from the overwhelming ethnic majority. China was not an overseas colonizer, but this was largely because they had no navy to speak of because of their overwhelming issues of land control and their lack of any nearby naval rivals or major consistent trade partners. If the Ming emperors knew that the Incans had cities of gold and silver, and they didn\u2019t have rebel and barbarian armies breathing down their necks, I\u2019m quite sure they would have figured out a way to Peru and set up military commanderies in what would eventually be the provinces of Yinzhou and Jinzhou.

Actually, in Taiwan\u2019s historical education, Han Colonization of Taiwan is a very important topic for pupils to understand how Taiwan transformed from Dutch Formosa to Chineses Taiwan and how Han Chinese colonized the island and marginalized the Taiwanese aborigines into highland under Qing Dynasty rule (1683-1895). If you are interested in this period of history, you can see the book below: How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century, by Tonio Andrade (2008)Book review: \u2018How Taiwan Became Chinese\u2019 - Taiwan Today ",
