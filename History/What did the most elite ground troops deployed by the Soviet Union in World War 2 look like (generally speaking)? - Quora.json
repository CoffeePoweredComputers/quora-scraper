            "answer_text": "I have several nominations: 1. Soviet Marines. (Marine Infantry).   They were:1. Considered elite. You see, Navy was considered one of the most elite branches of Soviet Armed Forces before the war, they had much higher conscription requirements (for example, all Navy (and Marines) members had to have a high school degree, even the last private). Obviously, as Navy requires much more intellectual activities than any infantry.2. They got much better training. 3. They were much better equipped. As they used Navy stockpiles of supplies, and Navy Chief Kuznetsov was a very decent commander (for example, he was one of the few Soviet commanders who anticipated German invasion days before, broke all Stalin\u2019s orders to \u201cremain calm\u201d, mobilised all his forces days before the invasion, and in the evening on June 21st put all his AA crews on maximum alert, explicitly telling them to shoot down any aircraft flying towards the ships from 0000 June 22nd irregardless of their status and shown hostility. As a result - his cruisers RADAR detected first waves of German bombers and not a single ship was lost the first days of invasion). For example, marines were almost completely issued semi-automatic SVT-40 rifles, unlike infantry, that used mostly Mosins. The problem was that SVT-40 was very dependant on proper maintenance, and was prone to jams otherwise. That\u2019s why \u201cordinary infantry\u201d didn\u2019t like them, but marines had both the training and supplies to properly maintain their rifles. Also their stockpile of SVTs was not lost during first year of the war.  Also they got some nice lend-lease toys like Tommy Guns:  4. They were badass. Partly this comes because of special, naval esprit-de-corps. I understand this as follows: on the ship, everyone\u2019s proper duty is important to survival of the whole crew. If you are afraid and run away from your station, the whole ship can be lost with all hands. If you stand at your station to the last, you may die, but the whole ship will survive. Mission comes first, then ship, then crew. So naval psychology is collectivism in its pure form: no matter how grim is situation, you are required to remain at your post no matter what. And this resulted in their high morale, determination and willingness to participate in the most desperate and unwinnable situations. Just read about Nevskiy Pyatachok or Kerch Amphibious Assault. These guys went on certain death without any hesitation. Also they were used on most important parts of the frontline, for example, in Stalingrad. Yes, Marines in Stalingrad, isn\u2019t it surprising?     They also loved to show-off: even when deployed on land, they usually wore Navy black peacoats, blue naval uniform with striped shirts and naval hats (although it is said that they wore them only for photos and to show off to infantry, not on the frontlines, because black is a bad camouflage colour). Shout \u201cUra\u201d on attack? Ha, that\u2019s too mainstream! The\u2019d better shout \u201cPOLUNDRAAA\u201d on bayonet charge! Because they were not some \u201cdirty land rats\u201d, but Elite of the Soviet Navy! And they also had women among their ranks:   Elizaveta Mironova, sniper of 255th Black Sea Brigade. Had more than 100 Germans on her personal score when she was killed near Novorossiysk in 1943. But among them, the Black Death, elites of Soviet Union, were units much more dangerous and experienced. Behold them:  181st Special Recon Detachment of Red Banner Northern Fleet. Basically, Soviet Marine Force Recon. Performed LRRPs up to 300km inside German lines, performing raids, capturing shore batteries, destroying German supply lines in Norway. Their raids were as far as Troms\u00f8 (just look on the map where Troms\u00f8 is and where is Russian/Soviet border) Their leader, Viktor Leonov, was Twice Hero of the Soviet Union. Also it was being said that US Marine Corps based some of their combat/recon manuals on some of their operations. I cannot confirm or deny this fact. Some English info on him and their unit: This Russian sailor forced a Japanese garrison to surrender \u2014 after he was captured ",

            "answer_text": "Well I wouldn\u2019t too much know but some of the best would be the Guards Rifle Infantry and Shock Infantry which these guys were major threats to the Germans and were really powerful.  ^ As you can see the Shock Troops look very professional as they really are. The Spetsnaz existed at the time but were in small numbers even though they were still very well trained however despite this, they are no where near their modern day and Cold War equivalents. I might say the Guards Rifle might be the most elite but I keep seeing these soldiers of the USSR in WWII called Red Guard which I think was top secret cause I don\u2019t see any documents of them. But here\u2019s the Guards Rifle  As you can see here they look close to normal Red Army soldiers but don\u2019t let those silly uniforms fool you. These guys are the Red Armies equivalent of the German SS and that info ALONE defines how insane these guys are. They had an army consisting of infantry and armor which also resembles close resemblance to the U.S Marines with their vehicles and stuff. The Guards Rifle infantry are U.S equivalents to Rangers and German equivalent to SS Panzer grenadiers. There were also Shock armies as well with tanks and stuff too and mainly had tanks useful for breakthroughs. Overall the Guards Infantry takes this. Edit: I might\u2019ve been incorrect as I forgot how elite the Soviet Marines were too \u2192  And lets not forget the Kremlin Guard probably one of the most insanely elite I have heard from another Quora to about them defending Moscow and only losing 97 men and killed over a thousand troops. He also said that the Marines were the most elite. ",
