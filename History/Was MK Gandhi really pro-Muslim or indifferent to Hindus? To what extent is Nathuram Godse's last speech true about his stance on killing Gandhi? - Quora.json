            "answer_text": "Gandhi was follower of Sanatan dharma , a staunch practicing Hindu who believed in all age old traditions of Hinduism. He was also a DEMOCRAT and learned his lessons on politics by reading Tolstoy and perfected his political belief in South Africa. When he cam back to India his political experience was more than the cumulative experience of entire Congress which at that time included stalwarts like Gokhale/ Tilak/ Lala Lazpat Rai among others. The problem with the then leadership of congress was it was made up largely lawyers and barristers who practices politics from their chambers and were practically aloof from the masses. Before Gandhi there was no single leader who had acceptance across the country and among all the classes of Indian society, Leaders like Tilak/Gokhale /Lazpat rai were famous and popular in small geography and did not command following across the length and breath of this nation. Gandhi is generally accused of being pro Muslims and pro Pakistan and generally speech by Nathuram Godse during his trial is quoted as a proof\u2026as if Nathuram Godse was a authority on the same, the basic thing forgotten very easily or overlooked very conveniently was he was addressing to the gallery and milking the nascent democratic norms of Freedom of speech and free and fair trail, he is the only ASSASSIN in the history of Modern world who has been given such freedom while on TRIAL\u2026..neither the assassin of Lincoln and Kennedy never faced a trial and were killed before being accorded a trial. Now for his being pro Pakistan and his acceptance to creation of Pakistan the basic question which is overlooked and never discussed in any forum including this was What were the demands of Jinnah for accepting united India? a. Jinnah demanded a loose confederation of Muslim Majority North west India with India. Just remember British India had around 560 princely states and Muslim population was in large number across India, in Kerala, central India, East India, Hyderabad and if this demand would have been accepted How the same relationship could be denied to them across India and what was stopping large principalities from demanding the same relationship. b. Equal seats in parliament for Hindus and Muslims ; just remember Muslim population was around 255 of total population of undivided India an dhe was demanding 50% seats reserved for Muslims. c. No discussion on Land Reforms and abolition of Zamindari , just understand 99% of leadership of Muslim League came from Landed Gentry and as soon as land reforms were implemented this gentry was supposed to lose it control and power, just remember in Pakistan no Land reforms have happened since 1947, the Waderas, Khans, Sardars, i.e. the Landed Zamindari class still rules the roost pf Pakistani Policy\u2026 Congress and Gandhi did not accept these demands and Jinnah never budged from these demands . The other was release of some 55 crores to Pakistan from consolidated funds of India, as per partition of India rules Pakistani share in consolidated funds of India on 15th August 1947 was Rs.55 crore , GOI stopped the release of fund after Invasion of Kashmir by Pakistani army in October of 1947, Gandhi as his nature was did not like going back on agreement and terms agreed and tried to reason and then sat on indefinite fast to persuade GOI to release these funds\u2026.. his reason was simple\u2026an agreement was made and it should be honored despite whatever changes or new issues have been introduced after signing the agreement\u2026. None of the above shows his pro-Muslim stance\u2026. Pakistan came into existence because Jinnah never wanted an united India and was hell bent on division of India at any cost\u2026the deliberation to avoid partition were always one sided where one side was keen to avoid it but other side did not budge even an inch to accommodate or avoid partition\u2026 the other instance is just an example of high level of Probity in personal and political life which people like Godse and his supporters could never understand till date\u2026as it is beyond their understanding \u2026\u2026.

He blindly supported Nehru . ",
