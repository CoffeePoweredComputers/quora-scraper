Your myopic progression thou is not dependent on wearing glasses , but if you have myopia n not wearing glasses then u will be deprived of crisp vision , if u don\u2019t wear correction then your eye n vision become suppressed which cannot b corrected even if u wear glasses later on, hence wearing glasses is must n also if there is pathological myopia wherein the error is more than -6D n seems to b increasing still u ought to wear glasses n get checked frequently as this is not under anyone\u2019s control that it stops .

            "answer_text": "Yes! Myopia or near-sightedness is a condition where the light enters the lens and falls before the retina. This condition can be corrected through right nutritious food, sun gazing and minimal eye stress. Retina is like an elastic rubber band which can be brought back to original state by following the above. Thereby giving ample time for the rubber band to come back to original shape. But if you were glasses, you are training your eyes to focus the light that falls before the lens. This is similar to hold the rubber band in deformed state(while hoping not to be deformed anymore). So one way or other, you are losing your eyesight! So, if you have lower power of eyesight, I recommend you get rid off the glasses. Once you get used to it, you will be wearing it forever. PS: This is applicable for people with near-sightedness, not for those wearing glasses due to headache! ",
