            "answer_text": "I will try to answer this question in a few words although I appreciate that it will be an over-simplification. Firstly, I can say that for many centuries, China was scientifically and technologically in advance of the West. A thousand years ago, in the Song Dynasty, China had paper and the printing press, while Europeans were still laboriously writing on calf skins. Literacy was increasing, military and industrial technology was advancing, clocks were becoming more accurate, and China seemed to be developing more in the way of capitalism than a purely agrarian economy. Even the political culture was becoming more sophisticated, with differing \u201cparties\u201d or factions at court. So when more \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cprogressive\u201d ministers were in power, the traditionalists would be sent away to govern an island, or retire to their family, or go to the mountains to paint or write poetry, and vice versa. For a time in China\u2019s history, there was an open intellectual space. New ideas were discussed. It was possible to experiment with new technology, and so on. In Kaifeng, the first Song capital, there was an intellectual ferment. The educational system and the exams were leading to improved knowledge, and surplus intellectual energy could be devoted to profitable research. This benefitted China. But there were faults within the system. For example, Wang An Shi came up with some very useful economic and political ideas. He was eventually stopped by the Empress Dowager, and other traditionalists at court. Indeed his horse-breeding programme was abandoned. The Mongols, the Jurchen and the Khitai peoples loved horses, and their cavalry later devastated China. Perhaps the Mongol invasion stopped China from progressing so fast. Or perhaps it was the fact that the \u201copen intellectual space\u201d I mentioned was getting narrower and narrower. In a world of warring empires, it seemed that the most important question was how to control China? How to keep China stable and keep the people obedient and the dynasty in power? These questions are not necessarily conducive to scientific or intellectual progress. During the Southern Song Dynasty, (1134\u20131279), the philosopher Chu Shi was busy formulating his intellectually rigorous \u201cneo-Confucianism,\u201d and one aspect of that philosophy was that social relationships were to be more ritualized and standardized. For example, women were to have much less freedom. But intellectual freedom was also at stake. I am not sure how Chu Shi would have thought of that issue. When Europeans saw Ming dynasty China, it came to seem like an ideal, well-run society controlled by a class of intellectuals and philosophers. The mandarins seemed to be running China well, and they had the right to physically punish the working classes. China was, or seemed to be amazingly prosperous. But at that very time, the Chinese mind was closing. The \u201copen intellectual space\u201d was getting narrower. To be a success, to be successful in China, you had to have passed the civil service exams, which were seen as all-important. If memory serves me correctly, there were local, district, provincial, levels to the exams. Then there was the national level, where people in the north went to Beijing for their exams, and people in the south went to Nanjing. Above that was the imperial level, and the top scholar of China who would be chosen by the emperor. As time went on, the system became narrower and narrower. Exams were based on the five classics and the four books. Men-it was always men-had to isolate themselves in little cubicles for the exams, which lasted 9 consecutive days! Passing those exams became the be all and end all of everything. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, it was actually possible to be a truly great scholar and never reach the top levels. You could write erudite books of Confucian philosophy and be highly-esteemed by those that did pass. You could be a genius but classed as a failure and a loser because, sigh, you just did not have the talent to pass those exams! So the examination system took on a life of its own. Whereas in previous dynasties, before 1368 (the start of the Ming dynasty), there had been some free intellectual space where science could develop, during and after the Ming dynasty, science and technology became stagnant. This wasn\u2019t true early in the Ming period but it soon was true. At the same time as the number of mandarin jobs remained stagnant, China was undergoing a population explosion. So now suddenly there was much more competition. One solution was just to buckle down and try one\u2019s best! That left little room for science! For some reason, literature was still active, but I think this may be because literature per se, did not necessary go against the mindset of the Chinese. Be that as it may, during the Ching Dynasty, (1644\u20131368), some of the emperors took great delight in censoring, controlling and limiting literature as much as humanly possible. It reminds me of the way China censors the internet now. Chinese culture always tended to be socially conservative, but in the Ching period it was much more so. And the Ching imperial family was Manchu, not Chinese, and that was one more reason to be super-cautious. Many Chinese people despise the Ching dynasty, because they held China back for so long. So, when the Europeans started to appear more frequently in China in the late 18th and 19th century, the Chinese intelligentsia simply lacked the intellectual wherewithal to adapt to this change. Their education would have told them that a lot of the new science was amusing but unnecessary, or indeed subversive. They would have seen their job as maintaining the peace. They would have depicted themselves as ruling through virtue (despite being appallingly corrupt and venal). They would have decided there was nothing to learn from Europe. In the 19th century the dynasty itself was in sharp decline. Perhaps Chinese civilization itself was now in steep decline. As famines, wars, and rebellions increased, people struggled to survive. That in itself might distract people from science and technology, but the fact was that in our Victorian era, some people in China did see the need for reform. Some reforms were undertaken. According to author Jung Chang, Cixi, the Dowager Empress of China, was not merely a roadblock but did try to modernize China. That said, it would be a case of Chinese middle class or upper-class people who had been exposed to a western education, or who had come into contact with more liberal currents of thought. That did happen. But the problem was that the old guard kept stepping in at the wrong time to thwart progress before it really got under way. If China had developed a modern navy at the right time in the 19th century, there would have been fewer invasions, better foreign trade, and the country would have gained prosperity sooner. ",

            "answer_text": "Why didn't China develop the science and technology that the West had in the 19th century? China has developed its science and technology in a different way than the West. And in a certain way, we might even consider it is surpassing the West since the 12th century. Due to the dominant religion in the West, the development of Western Science are \u2018capped\u2019 (limited) into the materialistic/physical domain only, whereas the non-physical realm (i.e. psychological and spiritual realms) is the domain of the religion and therefore untouchable/taboo. Hence, Max Plank, one of the founders of Quantum Physics once stated: \u201cScience cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of nature and therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.\u201d - Max Planck (see Relativity, the Absolute, the Human Search for Truth: Nobel Laureate and Quantum Theory Originator Max Planck on Science and Mystery ) Carl Gustav Jung, a 19th century psychiatrist came up with the concept of collective unconsciousness and the \u201cArchetypes\u201d and Rupert Sheldrake came up just recently with the concept of morphogenetic fields, both proposed to expand contemporary science into the non-physical realm, but due to the arrogance of the scientific community, they are called \u2018pseudo-science\u2019 and quasi ignored. It is no secret that the magnetic compass, paper, and printing are Chinese inventions during the Han Dynasty around 1st & 2nd century AD, and gunpowder was invented during the Tang Dynasty (9th century), long before the West know about them. In the 12th century, Chinese scholars were working on the \u201cNew-Science\u201d to investigate the nature of things. They combined the ancient philosophy of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism into a syncretic philosophy, known in the West as \u201cNeo-Confucianism\u201d. Unlike Western science, Chinese philosophy didn\u2019t put any restriction on the development of the new science and consider human as an integral part of nature subject to the investigations. Without any restriction they identified \u201cthe organizing principle\u201d called \u201cLi\u201d that is organising \u201cChi\u201d to form matter. Everything has its Li and Chi. There is no Li without Chi and no Chi without Li. Every human being also has his/her own Li. (see The Li Series ) The latest 21st-century western science is trying to find the \u201cGod particle\u201d to understand how matter is formed while ignoring C.G. Jung and Rupert Sheldrake concept of the non-physicals. Western Science is geared to control and exploit matter, while Chinese Science is geared to understand nature including human. They found that human nature/essence is basically multi-dimensional and eternal/immortal. I\u2019m sure there is plenty of research literature about this \u2018human science\u2019 in China, but one book I know is called \u201cThe Secret of the Golden Flower\u201d - (T\u00e0iy\u01d0 J\u012bnhu\u00e1 Z\u014dngzh\u01d0) translated by Richard Wilhelm with foreword and commentary by C.G. Jung. The book is about meditation to create \u2018eternal light-body\u2019 and to become a \u201cTrue Human\u201d - (Zhen Ren), who is immortal. Amongst some western spiritual groups, it is known as the process of \u201cAscension\u201d. In the West, we know of Jesus Christ, who resurrected from his death, appeared amongst his disciples at Pentecost and then ascended to \u2018heaven\u2019. In China, we know of the eight legendary immortals. The Secret of the Golden Flower mentioned above was attributed to Master Lu Dongbin, one of those eight legendary immortals. I believe there are many others in China who also attained immortality. We don\u2019t know them because those who attained it, usually don\u2019t want any publications. My ancestor, who came to Indonesia in the late 17th century was one of them. He was very well known as an excellent healer and Fengshui expert. People built nine (9) temples in different locations in East Java and Bali to worship him. The legend says that he built a water palace for the King within 3 nights with the help of beings from other dimensions. At the end of his worldly life he disappeared in the jungle, but every now and then he came to talk to people using other people body (trance channelling).

            "answer_text": "China always had very roughly 1 in 6 of the entire world population within its borders. The sciences it did develop were based on this fact. Hence, while mathematics and other abstract sciences were very important, mechanical engineering and others were not. Automation was simply unnecessary, and naval power didn't matter if you're surrounded by weaker nations. When Britain came knocking on China's door, they brought with them an adaptation to their needs. Machines and other labour-reducing technology became hugely important after the Black Death, when there was a labour shortage everywhere. The same technology would have been China's downfall if millions of people's jobs became replaced. However, it was the military need to protect oneself that drove China to adopt Western technology. A common misconception is that China lagged seriously behind Western powers because it lacked their tech. By the end of the 19th century, China had good manufacturing capacity for European rifles and other hardware, and was able to put up stubborn resistance during the Boxer Rebellion, Sino-French War, and First Sino-Japanese War, despite losing all of these. It was more so the effects of European intrusion that weakened China by dividing up the opinions of the court and introducing radical ideas. ",
