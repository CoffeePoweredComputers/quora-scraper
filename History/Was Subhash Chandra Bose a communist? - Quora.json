            "answer_text": "The problem with \u201cIndian Leftists\u201d is that they can consider anyone as a communist just because they had a slight inclination towards the left spectrum of political ideology. Be it Shaheed Bhagat Singh or Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, the Indian leftist in India has a habit of considering such nationalists as communists and leftists. Yes it's true that Netaji Bose and Bhagat Singh were socialists but then again just being a socialist or admiring the ideology of socialism just because one is anti imperialist will not make you a communist. For example, Mahatma Gandhi formulated the ideology of Gandhian socialism and later Atal Bihari Vajpayee of BJP, a right wing party introduced this ideology in his party principles but that doesn't makes Gandhi or even Atal Bihari Vajpayee as a leftist or communist. Similarly, just because Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose supported socialism doesn't makes him a communist. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose in his book \u201cIndian Struggle\u201d clearly mentions that Netaji wanted a dictatorial regime in the first 20 years of Independence as it would be essential to rule India with iron hand so as to inject the values of discipline and ensure stability for the development. He believed in the ideology of Samyavaad which was a mixture of fascism, communism blended in Indian style. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose even admired Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and met Adolf Hitler in Germany, who was hated by the communists[1]  Interestingly, Netaji formed a party which is the All India Forward Bloc when it was formed its constitution was about 200 pages while today it's less than 100 pages. The AIFB today is controlled by stooges of Communist Party of India (Marxist) who themselves used to call Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose as \u201cthe running dog of Japanese PM Tojo\u201d [2] Also, post independence it was the Left and the Marxists historians themselves who ensured that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose never finds a place in History text books. But this wasn't possible. The hatred which Communists have for Netaji can be witnessed by this fact, but still they try to portray him as communist. Therefore, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was not a communist Footnotes[1] Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose wanted ruthless dictatorship in India for 20 years | India News - Times of India[2] http://CPM wakes up, finds Netaji not Tojo's dog\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/cpm-wakes-up-finds-netaji-not-tojos-dog/articleshow/35301610.cms",

            "answer_text": "In fact, Subhas Bose had explicitly and repeatedly disassociated himself from communism \u2013 he considered himself \u201ca socialist, but that was a very different thing from being a communist\u2019\u2019 p. 348, Brothers Against The Raj. A primary distinction between communists and socialists lay in their respective emphasis on internationalism vis a vis nationalism. Bose had ridiculed the internationalism of the communists and had disparaged them for attacking the concept of nationalism: \u201cThe attack is not only ill advised but unconsciously serves the interests of our alien rulers...before we can endeavour to reconstruct Indian society....we should first secure the right to shape our own destiny...When political freedom has been attained, it will then be time to consider seriously the problem of social and economic reconstruction. As far as I am aware this is also the opinion of prominent communists in other lands. To introduce fresh cleavage within our ranks by talking openly of class war and working for it appears to me at the present moment to be a crime against nationalism. To what straits we may be reduced by a mal-assimilation of Karl Marx and Bakunin becomes manifest when we come across a certain class of Indian labourites (or communists, if you call them so), who openly advocate the use of British or foreign cloth on the plea of internationalism.\u2019\u2019 p. 166, Brothers Against The Raj. In 1927, in a letter from Mandalay jail to his brother, he had disassociated himself from Communism: \"If I had the remotest intention of becoming a Bolshevik agent, I would have jumped at the offer made and taken the first available boat to Europe. If I succeeded in recouping my health, I could then have joined the gay band who trot about from Paris to Leningrad talking of world revolution and emitting blood and thunder in their utterances. But I have no such ambition or desire.\u2019\u2019 p. 146, Brothers Against The Raj. In addition, while independence was primary, and unionisation secondary to Bose and other socialists, radicalisation and organisation of the workers was primary to Indian Communists p. 207, Brothers Against The Raj. In fact Nehru was more sympathetic to Communism - Nehru had said in a Press Statement issued on 18 December, 1933: \"I do believe that fundamentally the choice before the world today is between some form of Communism and some form of Fascism, and I am all for the former, that is Communism. I dislike Fascism intensely and indeed I do not think it is anything more than a crude and brutal effort of the present Capitalist order to preserve itself at any cost. There is no middle road between Fascism and Communism. One has to choose between the two and I choose the Communist ideal. In regards to the methods and approach to this ideal, I may not agree to everything that the orthodox Communists have done. I think that these methods will have to adapt themselves to changing conditions and may vary in different countries. But I do think that the basic ideology of Communism and its scientific interpretation of history is sound.\u2019\u2019 p. 351, The Indian Struggle (1920-1942). ",
