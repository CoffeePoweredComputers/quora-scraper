            "answer_text": "If you mean what were the major differences between French vs British colonization, you'll find few points below. But, if you were wondering: what are the major differences now between ex-French colonies and ex-British colonies, it's a different question (Commonwealth vs Francophonie).  Population sources British - Colonists were recruited from among middle-class farmers, artisans, tradesmen, indentured servants, convicted criminals or immigrants from other countries.French - Initially fur traders, merchants, and missionaries. In 1665 some 1100 French soldiers arrived and were given land. Neither Protestants nor peasant farmers were allowed to emigrate.Settlement British - In the southern colonies in Virginia and the Carolinas, the colonies used a plantation model. The settlements of New England and the Middle Colonies \u2013 Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware \u2013 in contrast, operated on a family-farm model. By 1700, the English colonies had a combined 100,000 inhabitants. Soon the colonists began growing tobacco, which they quickly produced in enormous quantities. Tobacco was very labor intensive: it took nine months of work each year to cultivate. Plantation owners therefore relied on indentured servitude and African slave labor to do the work. French - The first colony, Acadia, was founded in 1604, and Quebec was founded in 1608.  By 1660 there were about 3000 people living in New France. While by the eighteenth century the French claimed most of the U.S. Midwest, Louisiana, and Canada, its colonists were never as numerous as the English and Spanish. At first, French settlement was based upon the fur trade and, to a lesser extent, fishing. French colonies in the Caribbean were established on a much different basis than New France: the French established plantation-based colonies there for sugar and food. The most important French colony was Saint Domingue, modern-day Haiti and Martinique (which is still a French overseas department today). As in the Dutch and Spanish colonies, French sugar plantations relied heavily on the labor of African slaves.Government British - Distance from England and a frugal Parliament allowed colonists to set up local governments and representative assemblies and to tax themselves, as long as they did not take up arms against the Crown.French - Colonies were fully subject to the French king. There were no political rights or representative government, and public meetings could not be held without permission.Population Growth British - Rapid growth due to liberal immigration policies. By 1627 Virginia had approximately 1,000 settlers. By 1754 total population in the English colonies had grown to 1.5 million; this included large proportions of German and French.French - Slow growth; by 1672 no more than 5,000 colonists had settled throughout New France. New France also had a large gender imbalance \u2013 in the 1660s, the ratio of men to women was six to one. Since the first groups of colonists were overwhelmingly men, the colonists did not reproduce as quickly as the English colonists did. Some men had children with Native American women; their children, called M\u00e9tis, often became outcasts from both communities. The gender imbalance was eventually corrected, when Louis XIV sent boatloads of women to the new colony. In Canada the French population totaled just under 40,000 by 1734. In Louisiana, by 1763 there were approximately 10,000 settlers, including 5,000 slaves and Acadians. Relationships with Native Americans British - As in New France, Native American populations helped the English settlers stay alive; Native Americans gave supplies to the new arrivals and taught them to survive. Unlike the French, however, the English did not treat the Native Americans well in return.French - Fur trade with the Native Americans gave the French a seemingly endless supply of furs. The trading relationship between the French and the Native Americans was an equitable one: the French needed the Native Americans to provide and cure the furs, while the Native Americans needed the French for European items like metal pots.Sources: Page on granburyisd.orgPage on saylor.org Compare and Contrast the British, French and Spanish Empires ",

            "answer_text": "There is a great difference between Britain and France regarding their colonial past: Britain is tricky, France is conservative. The British rulers were not always benevolent and same as French rulers regarding their colonies, but this difference exposed with: The French regarded their mission to these colonies were to \u201cexport its civilisation mission\u201d and considered their colonies belonged to lower class and barbarians. Brits regarded their mission to their colonies were to assimilate, divide and bribe, while also setting up industrial revolution in their colonies, and banking.The French used their colonialism as a great expansion of its pride for military history, and as such, they don\u2019t prefer using colonial soldiers but only use the Francized soldiers or native French soldiers. The Brits used their colonialism to use and exploit the strong materials and population to help them fight in wars. This created the difference when French Army rarely had any regards of other colonial soldiers, as French officers did not trust them; but British Army often had Sikh regiments to Egyptian regiments to control in their main colonies.In both of these colonies, there were Governmental differences. France preferred both colonies to be ruled directly from Paris, even in the so-called protectorates like Morocco or Tunisia had little independence of its own; Britain was different, they slowly set up Governments in their colonies, as it could serve British interests. But this difference was most British-established Governments had more autonomy to maintain their control of colonies unlike French one, with India, Canada and Australia as examples, and not always under London\u2019s influence.On industrialization, Britain set up industries, factories, economic system, universities, both in their colonies, so in the future these colonies would have to remain a huge debt of British modernization in these colonies. It\u2019s largely successful within India, Jordan, Malaysia, Australia, Singapore, Kuwait, Canada, Egypt, UAE, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland and Qatar being the most successful ones (not all of them were in pair, but they developed a lot); but France had little interests of establishing industrialization, nor even trying to improve education unless it is suit for their climate. As for the result, many of former French colonies suffered economic damages, educational system crippled or wars and often in infrastructure collapses, repeatedly happened like Vietnam, Cambodia, Algeria, Mali, Syria, Niger or Ivory Coast. There were exception when Sudan and South Sudan were even more terrible than Tunisia and Morocco.British colonial rules didn\u2019t care much on religious or ethnic issues unless they found suit, like what later came to Israel/Palestine, Pakistan/India and South Sudan/Sudan; they didn\u2019t often send preachers to their colonies. French colonial rules, instead, favored people affiliating with the Catholic Church and Vatican. French rule was largely fueled by the meaning of religious rather than British rule.When it came to colonial treatments, British rulers treated its colonies fairly well, although there were dark chapters like Bengal famine, Irish war and famine, but overall British imperial rule marked with a level of political regarding freedom and of course, they departed away right on time to let these colonies develop itself. France however, had a poor reputation of treating its colonies and it staged many wars against French rule, the two most devastated wars were in Indochina and Algeria, so France remained to be one of the worst oppressors in the history.",
