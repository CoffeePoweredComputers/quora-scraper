            "answer_text": "Because the District was set up so that no state housed the nation\u2019s government. Now, I am sympathetic to the lack of representation for the District\u2019s residents. I feel the most appropriate solution would be to carve out the strictly federal government portion and have the remaining residential areas retroceded back to Maryland, from which the territory originated. This is what happened to the portion that Virginia had ceded to be part of the District, which was returned in the 1800s. The retroceded piece could easily be set up as the new Maryland county of Columbia. The residents would become Maryland citizens with the right to vote in it\u2019s elections. The state would likely be apportioned an additional Representative in the House because of the additional population. There are, of course, issues with this solution, but I feel that would be most appropriate. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite simply it is too small. Washington, DC is even smaller than any of its neighboring counties in Virginia and Maryland. Here are a few statistics for comparison:  Basically, Washington, DC is a city. It is not sufficiently large enough to hand the duties of city and state nor does it have the tax base to support them. Some people think a commuter tax could help, but that would likely drive more people out of DC, and encourage remote working. Between traffic being a mess and the terrible condition of DC road people don\u2019t need any more incentive to not go into DC. For voting and representation purposes, being part of Maryland (where it originally came from ) would seem to be a reasonable idea. ",
