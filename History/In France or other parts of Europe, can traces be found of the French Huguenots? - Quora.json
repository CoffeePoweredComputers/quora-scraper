            "answer_text": "You'll have a hard time, they're still very persecuted! I'm kidding. On the one hand, not all Huguenots have left, and on the other hand, they're now called Protestants. Protestantism, which was established in France at the beginning of the Reformation, is now the third most popular religion in France after Catholicism and Islam, but before Judaism. French Protestants are divided on the one hand between the two denominations officially recognized in 1802, the Lutheran churches and the Reformed churches, and on the other hand between the various evangelical denominations united in the National Council of Evangelicals of France, most of which came from England and the United States during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such as Baptism, Pentecostalism, Adventism and the other evangelical churches. These represent about one third of French Protestants and are growing rapidly. According to the Protestant Federation of France, there are 2.6 million Protestants in France with 4000 temples and 1600 pastors. If you want to find a very lively Huguenot atmosphere, I advise you to visit the C\u00e9vennes. And especially in Mialet where the \"assembl\u00e9es du d\u00e9sert\" still take place in memory of those prayers made deep in the forest to escape persecution.  From there, you will be able to follow the trail of the Camisards towards Geneva and freedom\u2026  Le Mus\u00e9e du D\u00e9sert (in English) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there are over one million French people of Huguenot ancestry in France today as well as millions of others overseas. Today, there are some Reformed communities around the world that still retain their Huguenot identity. In France, Calvinists in the United Protestant Church of France and also some in the Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine consider themselves Huguenots. A rural Huguenot community in the Cevennes that rebelled in 1702 is still being called Camisards, especially in historical contexts. Huguenot exiles in the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa, Australia, and a number of other countries still retain their identity. Emigration and diaspora The bulk of Huguenot \u00e9migr\u00e9s relocated to Protestant states such as the Dutch Republic, England and Wales, Protestant-controlled Ireland, the Channel Islands, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Electorate of Brandenburg and Electorate of the Palatinate in the Holy Roman Empire, and the Duchy of Prussia. Some fled as refugees to the Dutch Cape Colony in South Africa, the Dutch East Indies, the Caribbean colonies, and several of the Dutch and English colonies in North America.
