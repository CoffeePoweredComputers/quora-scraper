The Treaty of Penn with the Indians, sometimes known as Penn's Treaty with the Indians at Shackamaxon or more simply Penn's Treaty with the Indians, is an oil painting by Benjamin West, completed in 1771-72. The painting depicts William Penn entering into peace treaty in 1683 with Tamanend, a chief of the Lenape (\"Delaware Indians\") Turtle Clan, under the shade of an elm tree near the village of Shackamaxon (now Kensington) in Pennsylvania. The peace between the Lenape Turtle Clan and Penn's successors would endure for over 70 years, until the Penn's Creek Massacre of 1755.[1] The treaty William Penn entered into was remarked upon by Voltaire, who called it \"... the only treaty never sworn to and never broken.\" \u2013Wikipedia - Penn's Treaty with the Indians This is Benjamin West\u2019s \"The Treaty of Penn with Indians\" painted 1771-1772.
