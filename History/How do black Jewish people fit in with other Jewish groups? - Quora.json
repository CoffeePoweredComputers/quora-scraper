            "answer_text": "It depends on what group of Judaism we're going to fit in with. There's two basic cultural types of Jews: Ashkenazi (white, Eastern Europe diaspora) and Sephardi (which is basically everyone else, as Sephards have been found throughout Africa, Mexico, and China). Then there's the religious sub groupings of Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox. With other Sephardic Jews, there's usually never issues, however with Ashkenazis, there can be some controversy. I'll touch on my personal interactions with each: Reform: This was the type of synagogue I attended as a child. Here, I was accepted with mostly open arms, some skepticism and intrigue, until my Bar Mitzvah, and after this, I was fully integrated. I am still friends with the people who I went to Hebrew School with. Temple Emmanuel in Roanoke, VA was the shul.  Conservative: This is the type of synagogue I attend now and started exploring as a teenager. As the practices are more regulatory and strict than Reform, this is where I was personally most comfortable. It's not an immediate welcome with open arms, but there's definitely none escorting me out the door either. The key to acceptance here was simply interacting with people and allowing them to see me worship. Nothing contrived for the purposes of assimilation, but not hiding anything either. Once people saw I laid Tefillin, could follow through a typical service, and knew how to conduct myself without people instructing me, the general consensus was \"Okay, he's done this before\". I attended Beth Israel in Roanoke, VA and now recently began attending Sinai Temple in Los Angeles.  Orthodox: I was a part of Torah Teen Resort in Napanoch, NY through Chabad Lubavich at the age of 15, almost went to Yeshiva at 17, and later studied with various people in Chabad in Los Angeles. I never felt a part of here and that's because they treated me like a foreign agent. During service, I was never given a Aliyah. Ever. That's because they didn't really see me as a Jew. They wouldn't even bother asking me if I was a Cohen or Levi. I remember I went to the Chabad house in Los Feliz in early 2013 and they were waiting for a minyan...I showed up as the 10th person, and they waited until two other people came before we proceeded with the service. The typical interaction to this day is: \"What, you're Jewish?!?!\" (me) Uh, yeah \"Okay, but is your mother Jewish? \" (me) Yes, she is \"Wow, that's crazy...okay, okay...so, is her mother Jewish?\" (me) *sigh*...response here changes depending on where my tolerance level is...

            "answer_text": "It really depends. I will only address the social aspect, since in the religious aspect, there is no distinction. In any social context, people find it easier to relate to other of a similar background. This is natural and a part of human nature. Black Jews themselves are not homogeneous. Some are American, Israeli, African or another nationality. Some are born Jewish and some are not. Some are very Orthodox and some are very liberal and progressive. So there are two aspects. #1 - the actual background of the Black Jew. If the Black Jew is from a different culture and nationality than the majority of the community/congregation, then they may have a hard time fitting in and/or being accepted. The same can be said for any White Jew in the same situation. However with Black Jews, the gap may be widened due to the physical differences alone. This doesn't apply so much if the Black Jew is a member of a community where the majority of the community has a background like theirs (i.e. the Black Jewish community in Chicago). #2 - how Black Jews are perceived. This is a very tricky area to discuss because you can't make blanket statements about how all White Jews see Black Jews. On one extreme, some White Jews see Black Jews as an anomaly and personally see Black Jews as not being \"really\" Jewish...in spite of what Jewish law may say. To them, being Jewish is about bloodline and culture. If you aren't born into it or if it is different from theirs, you're not really a Jew. To the other extreme, some White Jews see Black Jews as their long lost brothers. Even to go as far as to travel to remote areas of the world where Black people are either descended from Jews or practicing some form of Judaism...and they go there to bring them into the larger Jewish community and will even facilitate their emigration to Israel if they so desire. Commonly what occurs is something in between. Little outright hostility towards Black Jews from other Jews...but something short of full acceptance. The divide manifests itself most often in the areas of marriage and dating, where a non-Black Jewish set of parents may disapprove of their child marrying a Black Jew, mainly due to racial/cultural reasons; and in regards to the education of young Black Jewish children - who are often educated in White Jewish institutions where they learn and/or see little in regards to Black Jewish history, experiences...or even fail to ever see any formal examples of Black Jews besides themselves (this is a big issue in Jewish children books...where Black Jews are rarely depicted).

            "answer_text": "There are two parts to this question, and it is a serious question. First, from a religious aspect, the race of a person is completely irrelevant in Judaism. In fact, in Conservative Judaism today, race, gender, and sexual orientation are completely irrelevant.  All aspects of religious observance are applicable to all Jews. No one is privileged above anyone else (including clergy) and nothing is hidden. From a social standpoint, there is an uncomfortable reality that racism still exists in some communities. This is very much related to the background of the people in the community and reflects the fact that traditionally there has been very few black Jewish people. Unfortunately, while Jews have supported civil rights actions for the last 150 years in America, standing together with Martin Luther King throughout the turbulent 60's, a number of African-American leaders have chosen to view Jewish groups as adversaries. Some well-known pseudo-religious leaders in the Muslim community (e.g. Farrakhan) have made their anti-Jewish and anti-Israel feelings known. This, incorrectly, fuels a polarity between Jews and African Americans in the US and bolsters racist undertones in some communities. I should say that, here in Las Vegas, due to the nature of the community - a rather heterogeneous and accepting congregation - there is little evidence of this. ",
