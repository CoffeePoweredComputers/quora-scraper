It has its equivalent in Dating and Relationships in the caterwaul, \u201che stole my woman!\u201d which completely discounts that the woman in question has Freedom (is not, in advanced cultures, chattel) and is the one making the choice. Slightly less often, purveyors of unsuccessful culture use other rhetoric to disparage the taste, intelligence, breeding, etc., of those who chose other than the complainers\u2019 culture. Cultures must \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 be functional, i.e., a successful way of living for the practitioners of a given culture, otherwise that culture will be abandoned because its practitioners have all died, or have all chosen another set of cultural practices to adopt as better than what they had been doing. Globalization offers increased knowledge of other cultures and ways of living to everyone, which in turn presents increased competition for \u201ctraditional cultures.\u201d Those traditional cultures will persist if they work for their practitioners, and won\u2019t if they don\u2019t, when compared to any/all other cultures of the world. Everyone gets to choose \u2026 unless someone else arrogantly prevents them. ",

Further it is a hallmark of education, as I know it, to be respectful and interested in the culture of persons one may meet in life. That the world has many cultures is self-evident. Then any moves to subjugate, kill or simply open warfare a Culture is not something that can be condoned. It is in this sense that Cultural Imperialism is unacceptable. ",
