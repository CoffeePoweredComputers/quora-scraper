            "answer_text": "God Himself did it. Though it isn\u2019t totally done yet. There is something up there. That I know almost certainly. But not 100%. And that\u2019s because I\u2019ve seen some coincidental looking occurrences that were impossible to be real coincidences. They could not be coincidences because they came from a time where you had asked for a coincidence. A coincidence like that can\u2019t be coincidence. That is a response. God is a strange character. He seems to not know what He is capable of. Maybe that\u2019s why He answers so few prayers. He doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re to Him? But whatever, it\u2019s like the song \u201cGod sometimes you just don\u2019t come through.\u201d A God can survive centuries of not responding but eventually they get discarded. The Egyptian Gods were alive and responsive for a very long time but unresponsive for many centuries afterwards and people gave up and found or made new Gods. Their old Gods no longer pulled them through calamities. The same with the Greek and Roman Gods. Now slowly, but not that slowly, after 2000 years of \u2018not coming through\u2019 for too many people our current God is undermining His self. ",

            "answer_text": "The fundamentalist of religions who pick and choose passages in their 2000-year-old holy book to feed the faithful that validated slavery in the service of the plantation owners who were the richest people in the U.S. at the time. IE: the Southern Baptists preaching that slavery was not included as a sin against God In the service of the Plantation owners. We are dealing with Muslim fundamentalists who perform horrible crimes against humanity. Constantine in ancient times noticed that the Christians that were facing sure death, would not renounce Jesus. Constantine thought that kind of faith is very useful for his rule. Whatever happened to \u201crender unto Caesar that is Caesars and unto God things that are Gods\u201d ",
