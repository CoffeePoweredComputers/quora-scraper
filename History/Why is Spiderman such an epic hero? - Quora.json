            "answer_text": "He most certainly is! I think the reason, though, is similar to Batman\u2019s- his overall humanity. There are plenty of superheroes out there (Captain America, Iron Man\u2026 most of the Avengers really) that are human, but they just seem so disconnected from us. Captain America is basically a legend, his fame from the World War known by many. Iron Man has more humanity, but still feels disconnected, because he lived an overall good life, and is very rich. Most can't identify with a billionaire playboy, it's like hearing about Bill Gates. But Spidey is different. He's just a teen at high school- we've all been there before. Before getting powers he's just like any one of us. And even when he got powers, before his uncle Ben was murdered he probably would have just used his powers for personal gain- he wasn't exactly rich. But then, as I said above, his uncle was murdered. As Peter Parker stood over his uncle\u2019s body, Ben\u2019s wise words crept into his brain- \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility\u201d. Peter realised that he could have stopped his uncle\u2019s murder, but he chose not to because he was selfish. That is a very human quality. Peter was overcome with the realisation that he needed to use his great power to help people, and thus, Spider-Man was truly borne. He's so epic because before a radioactive spider decided to bite him, he was normal like any one of us. Heck, that spider could've bitten anyone, but fate (or, at least, Stan Lee) decided that it would happen to Peter. And even when he became a superhero, under that mask he was still facing very human problems that teens his age were facing as well. And that is what makes him so epic- his sheer normality underneath the extraordinariness (is that even a word?).  ",

            "answer_text": "Spider-Man (write it properly, please) is very popular because he\u2019s very human. Of course, the lesson that a great power comes with great responsabilities is always true. But it\u2019s not completely the point. Every problem an average human of our time has ever had (bad marks, paying the bills, being ostracized by peers, being too shy to make the first move, even flu and catching a cold) Spidey has had it. He\u2019s like you. And me. And the guy on the street. And the guy at the chemist\u2019s. He\u2019s just a person who happens to get powers, and he tries to use them at his best. But then again, he\u2019s human. He can\u2019t always accomplish his goals. He fails. He suffers. But, what makes him a bit better than you and me is\u2014 when he fails, he cracks a joke and he\u2019s back up. It might take days or months\u2014 he will always be back to do what he does. Because he can\u2019t ever give up. He\u2019s just unable to stand down, literally or figuratively. He\u2019s just a bit better than me. And than you. That\u2019s why I can always dream, I can always try, to be like him. I can\u2019t crawl on walls, of course. But if he can get back up after his losses, why can\u2019t I? If he can use his talents for good, why can\u2019t I? Why can\u2019t you? Anyone could be Spider-Man. He\u2019s not the kind of hero we should look up to without ever being like him, like Superman. He\u2019s not perfected in the moral sense like Superman, nor in the physical sense like Batman. Because we, you and me, can\u2019t be like Superman and Batman. They\u2019re far too perfect. But we can be Spider-Man. We can use our powers to support our responsability. Spider-Man tells us that we can be heroes. That\u2019s why he\u2019s epic. ",
