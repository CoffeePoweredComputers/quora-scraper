            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not. Oil is located where steamy jungles once were. But some is cheap to extract & refine, and some is expensive to exploit. We\u2019ve burned up most of the cheap easy stuff. Now we have to burn oil to produce oil. Mid-East oil was under barren land, like all the gushers in Texas/Oklahoma. Tulsa was the oil capital of the world in 1949. Ever see photo of Santa Barbara beach in the early 1900s? see below: Know what that area looks like today? Lights of the offshore oil rigs at night, big pipes coming onshore to refinery on the beach, no kidding.  ",

            "answer_text": "Because parts of the Arabian Plate used to be underwater after it broke off from Africa. As it got closer to the Eurasian plate, and Anatolian those parts then rose to above sea level due to tectonic activity.  Really, all areas where crude oil is found were underwater at one point or another. Most of the oil is probably actually in the Ocean, but it is hard to find and expensive to extract. ",
