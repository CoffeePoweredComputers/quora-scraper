            "answer_text": "Many people (me included) find that very likely. The arguments are mostly circunstancial and go as follows: That the portuguese at least strongly suspected that there was land, or islands, west of the Azores and Cape Verde, before Colombus\u00b4s is well documented by maps and 15th century tradition. Columbus, before his first voyage, was certain that there was land on the western parts. He got this conviction, according to his son, both from portuguese maps and from talks with sailors. There\u00b4s also definite evidence for this on the letters of Columbus and the spanish kings, in which its said that the portuguese thought that there are lands south of those dicovered by Columbus. According to Las Casas, Columbus sailed a more southern route on his third voyage (1498) because he knew that the portuguese king knew or at least strongly suspected that there was land located there.After Columbus\u00b4s discovery of the New World, the spanish immediatly proposed a line dividing the world in portuguese and spanish areas of influence. This first treaty drafted in May 1493 defined the \u201cborder\u201d as a line going 100 leagues west of Cape Verde. The territories on the west of the line would belong to Spain, and on the east to Portugal. The Portuguese king couldnt accept this , and time and again struggled to move the line more to the west. In the final treaty (Tordesillas, September 1494), the border was defined 370 leagues west of Cape Verde - thus including part of Brazil. Theres no reason at all for the portuguese to make such a point in moving the line this further west, unless they knew, or at least strongly suspected, of the existence of the brazilian lands.We know that the mariner Afonso Gon\u00e7alves left on an expediction to the western southern seas in November 1494 - leading to a protest by the spanish that the portuguese were trespassing the Tordesillas treaty line. Afonso Gon\u00e7alves was later hefty rewarded for his efforts. We dont know the results of this expection, but the fact that he was rewarded shows that he found something or at least brought back information about unknown territories.in the Esmeraldo de Sito Orbis, a book about sailing and explorations written beetween 1505\u20131508, the writer, the portuguese mariner Duarte Pacheco Pereira, claims that in 1498 he sailed to on kings\u00b4s orders to \u201cdiscover\u201d the \u201cwestern parts beyond the ocean\u201d. then he describes the brazilian lands nowadays located there. The text is sketchy, and one could argue he was just describing what was already known by the time he was writing (Brazil was \u201cofficially\u201d known since 1500). But theres no point in mentioning the otherwise unknown 1498 expedition at all, if it had been totally fruitless. Most likely, this 1498 expedition is related to brazilian lands and they did land there.Regarding sailing and the first \u201cdiscovery of Brazil\u201d in May 1500, theres no reason for Cabral\u00b4s - the official \u201caccidental\u201d discoverer - fleet to detour as far west as he did on his way to India, if supposedly they didnt know about any Brazilian lands. A sailing mistake that would push the fleet so farther west is extremelly unlikely. So definitely, he was there because he wanted to be there, and the reason he wanted to be there must be that he already knew, or at the very least had a very strong hunch, about the existence of Brazil.On the \u201cMestre Jo\u00e3o\u00b4s\u201d letter to the king of Portugal, written during the Cabral\u00b4s expedition, where he reports the 1500 discovery, he very clearly writes that the king \u201cmay see the location of this new found land on a map owned by the mariner Pero Vaz Bisagudo\u201d. He even adds that that map is outdatted because it doenst show whether the land is inhabited or not. this proves that the portuguese knew about Brazil for at least a few years before 1500 and even had maps showing it.There are other arguments, but these are the strongest in my opinion. So in short, its very likely that: Before Columbus the portuguese already knew or very strongly suspected about the existence of the New World;There were a number of secret expeditions (amongst these the Gon\u00e7alves 1494 and Pacheco Pereira 1498 expeditions) send by the portuguese king after Columbus in order to recognise the southern continent. These had to be secret in order to keep from the spanish the location of lands who might end to be spanish territory.The discovery of Brazil in 1500 by Cabral wasnt an \u201caccident\u201d - Cabral was oridered to make a detour on purpose on his official mission. The territory was already known and this \u201cdiscovery\u201d was organised as soon as they were sure that the lands could be claimed by Portugal with no issue.",

            "answer_text": "Everything indicates that the Portuguese already knew about the existence of Brazil, before Cabral got there. Let's look at some evidence. Even before his return, the story goes that Vasco da Gama had already recorded in his logbook, somewhere around 1497, that American lands existed, communicating the king of Portugal, D. Manuel, as soon as he returned to Portugal. Christopher Columbus, upon discovering America in 1492, suggested in his manuscripts the existence of other lands south of the Dominican Republic. A few years before Cabral arrived in Brazil, more precisely in 1494, Portugal and Spain signed the Treaty of Tordesillas. Everything indicates that the first Portuguese to set foot on Brazilian soil was not Cabral, but Duarte Coelho, a person of extreme trust of the king D. Manuel and considered a genius in navigation and astronomy, at that time. Coelho discovered Brazil at the end of 1498, at the behest of the king. The big problem was that Duarte Coelho ended up landing between Maranh\u00e3o and Par\u00e1, in lands belonging to Spain, according to the Treaty of Tordesillas. Thus, when he returned to Portugal, the king asked the mission to remain confidential and that, in the meantime, a new mission be prepared that should reach Brazil elsewhere, on land belonging to Portugal.
