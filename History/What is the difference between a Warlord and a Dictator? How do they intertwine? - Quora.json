            "answer_text": "Technically, a warlord exerts authority by armed forces over a territory. He is not elected or considered a political entity. His favour may be sought for things to get done but is not usually acknowledged as a political representative of a nation. A dictator can be and often is elected into office, whether fairly and only after he becomes a tyrant or in rigged elections. He may even be a warlord that takes over the entire state but, mainly, he is then considered the head of state and legal representative of the country. So, whiles for instance Stalin may have been a dictator, he was also head of state in the eyes of the Soviet union and the world. Warlords may be rebels or actually work under the government to control parts of the country. Not always so, but they would be the henchmen of a dictator . ",
