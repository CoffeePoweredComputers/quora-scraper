            "answer_text": "Yes (but also\u2026No) But mostly YES Here\u2019s what millions of revisionist recent boxing fans in love with technically inferior boxer like Wilder or an untested celebrity-look-the-part-of-a-champion Anthony Joshua backer don\u2019t realize - TYSON dominated everyone and anyone for 4 years and it wasn\u2019t close with anyone. He did flame out to soon - but he didn\u2019t flame out fast. Most people don\u2019t know: \u201cTyson holds the third longest unified championship reign in heavyweight history at eight consecutive defenses. He currently ranks #15 in BoxRec's ranking of the greatest heavyweight boxers in history. [10] He was ranked No. 16 on The Ring's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time, [11] and No. 1 in the ESPN: The Worldwide Leader in Sports list of \"The Hardest Hitters in Heavyweight History.\" [12] Sky Sports described him as \"perhaps the most ferocious fighter to step into a professional ring.\" [13] He has been inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame. People confuse the bitter disappointment of watching him decline so far so fast once it started and convince themselves he wasn\u2019t dominant for very long. UNTRUE - He was dominant before he won the title and then he KEPT the title with blowout beating after blowout beating for YEARS - not months - YEARS. He held the kind of status that transcends his sport just like Jordan did with basketball - HE was THE MIKE for a long time before MICHAEL hit his airness status. And at the time the fighters he dismantled were respected far more then than now - but no one mentions it\u2019s not like the heavyweight division is always loaded with great fighters. We have three dominant heavyweights right now - 3 - AND ONLY TWO OF THOSE CAN ACTUALLY BOX. But people bash him for smoking Spinks, Bruno, Pinklon, Razor, Tucker, Berbeck, Holmes, Bonecrusher, and anyone else that could have been vastly more respected today if Tyson hadn\u2019t obliterated them in his day. And another truth no one wants to admit - You take Mike Tyson on his best day, and match him against ANY heavyweight in history and no matter who you pick no one would bet the farm against a pinnacle Mike Tyson feel great about their chances. If Mike Tyson knocked out Ali in some fantasy reality time warping fight NO ONE COULD CLAIM THEY WERE STUNNED by the outcome. For my friend John McGlothlin, I\u2019ll go ahead and say the same could be said for Ali if it went the other way - I respect John\u2019s opinion on Tyson more than most people I\u2019ve interacted with because he makes valid points and can use facts to support his arguments - but the point is yes. Until Douglas beat him and the loss of his mentor and then trainer and the appearance of the soul vampire that is Don King - Tyson was easily the best fighter of his era. And NO ONE mention the steroid cheating headbutting fake man of God known as Evander Nothing-Real-About-Him-Holyfield who cheated, lied, cheated, and pretended to be innocent better than any obvious bad guy in boxing ever did. He was a fake the whole time who could have cemented himself as the greatest cruiserweight of all time if he hadn\u2019t been so damn jealous of Tyson that he had to dope up on roids and head but Mike with his mutated cranium to get the win and play it up as a good guy. I wish Tyson had headbutted him in the nose instead of bitting his ear - would have evened the fight at least a little bit. So be fair - knock him for his inexcusable behavior, choices, and wasted years of what could have been a spectacular career - But please let\u2019s all stop degrading the heights he did achieve because it\u2019s hard not to judge the depths he fell to in some very public ways. It wasn\u2019t brief - it was TOO BRIEF - not the same thing ",

            "answer_text": "For a very short period of time, yes. The problem was, he was so easily tempted out of his discipline when Don King pulled him away from Kevin Rooney\u2026 Tyson lost both his emotional connection to his adoptive parents and the (boxing) family that turned him into a fighter and taught him that very disciplined violent approach. Plus the crazy time When Robin Givens married him and called him manic depressive on national TV, the rape and imprisonment etc. After that he was beaten by Douglas, Holyfield, and after that he could only really ko guys through sheer speed and power without much focus or game plan. He also never overcame adversity to win a fight. Never even got up to continue fighting. So, while he was a force of nature for a brief time, and had perhaps an unparalleled combination of speed, power, knock out ability with any punch with either hand, and good defense, losing it so easily, never overcoming adversity, we have to wonder how good he was in the overall sense, as in, could he have ever been a complete fighter? How long was this period of dominance and that extraordinary ability we saw for just a couple of years? Isn\u2019t that less than what anyone would consider an era? We were fortunate to have him, but as an all-time great he sure didn\u2019t pan out. ",
