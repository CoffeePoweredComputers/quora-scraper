            "answer_text": "To my knowledge, the oldest scent still in use is Queen of Hungary water, which dates to about 1370 (sources vary). Queen of Hungary water originated as a headache remedy, and over the centuries its uses have grown. There is a rich variety of recipes for Queen of Hungary water. Key ingredients are rosemary and brandy. The next oldest fragrance still used today is Farina's Eau de Cologne which was first sold in 1709.  It'll cost you about $75 for 4.2 oz, which isn\u2019t bad. After 1709, there's quite a few scents of long history still in production. None of these is a perfect recreation of the original: natural ingredients inevitably vary from one year to the next. International an domestic law ban the use of some ingredients, some ingredients have become so scarce as to be prohibitively costly (sandalwood) or are now regarded as immoral (civet). However, the technology of synthetic fragrances makes it possible to create modern versions that are very, very close to the original. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly, many of the aromatics used in the ancient world are still used in modern perfumery. Original formulas like the Roman nardinum is just not pleasant according to current perfumery tastes. It was made using spikenard (Nardostachys jatamansii) a herb from the Himalayas resembling valerian in scent. Some ancient world fragrances such as musk (from the scent gland of musk deer) are still being used. Aloes (Aquilaria spp), (which is mentioned in the bible) is still in high demand and generally sold these days under the Arabic name \u2018Oud\u2019.Myrrh was the base note for a number of ancient perfumes but is not often used these days because it tends to have a medicinal scent.Perfumery is a constantly evolving art and tastes change markedly over millennia.
