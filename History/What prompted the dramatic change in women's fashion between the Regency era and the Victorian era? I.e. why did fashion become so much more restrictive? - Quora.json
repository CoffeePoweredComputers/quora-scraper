            "answer_text": "Tastes change to reflect the needs of the time. Regency fashion followed the French Revolution, and it represented the political, philosophical and aesthetic antithesis of the Bourbon monarchy (which set the fashion trends for all of Europe during the 18th century). Regency fashion was very much influenced by the philosophy of the Enlightenment and therefore incorporated many things from classical antiquity. There was a pressure and a call for minimalism, \u2018natural\u2019 beauty, and egalitarianism, all of which challenged the excess, artifice and hierarchies of pre-revolution French fashion. The latter 19th century was dominated by industrialism, urbanization, globalism/imperialism, etc. This is very different from the pastoral fantasies and the light chemise dresses of Austen and the Regency/Directoire period. Napoleon reinstates a French aristocracy and makes himself an emperor. The grecian country-peasant look is no longer fashionable, and folks want to look distinguished, urban and wealthy. Bright saturated chemical dyes are invented, the new Bessamer process makes mass-produced steel available (and consequently steel-boned corsets and steel cage crinolines), the sewing machine is invented, etc. All of these innovations in technology are reflected in fashion. The technological revolution represented a forward-looking dynamism of mass-production and the power of man triumphing over the power of nature, all of which really negated the classicizing tastes of Regency style. Regency style looked to ancient history and the natural world for its aesthetic and epistemological inspiration. If you think of a woman\u2019s figure when you juxtapose the classical, gauzy, almost see-through dresses of the Regency period and the very tailored and fitted dresses of the Victorian era, it\u2019s not difficult to see which represents nature and which represents \u2018civilization\u2019 (or man\u2019s ability to conquer nature). However, it must also be said that fashion is like a pendulum. On one level, there is the socio-cultural influence, but on the other end, there\u2019s a limit to how much garments can change. If a skirt is very long in one period, then it will rise and be short in the next because where else is it gonna go? If dresses are very loose and simple in one era, as they were in the early 19th century, then in the next, they\u2019ll be structured and ornamental. There\u2019s always a back-and-forth with culture and with fashion where we travel so far in one direction that, over time, it begins to lose its novelty; and then we rush back in the opposite direction in search of something radically different.
