This means that from noon to noon (a day\u2019s run for any ship, even today) you did not have much in the way of checking your position, so your course made good (or the course you were steering), adjusted for magnetic variation and your leeway (which any good seaman was sure to find out in his first days in a new ship) and \u201ccasting the log\u201d for your speed through the water, adjusted for what you considered the current or tidal stream was, could be plotted on the chart to give a reasonable idea of how your last day\u2019s run went. Doing all this chartwork (still a feature of RYA courses as they were in my yachtie days I would imagine), resulted hopefully in your next noon sight (providing the cloud cover allowed it) being spot on. Yeah right I hear you say, but many experienced navigators weren\u2019t that far out. We left Singapore on a voyage to the west coast of Canada (Seattle) taking a Great Circle route via the Aleutians. The deck apes never saw the sun from the day we left - not even a glimmer of a star sight. The whole 50-odd day voyage was made by DR, with the Old Man saying to the 2nd Mate when we were around a day away \u201cWarm up the radar (valve driven in those days) for the 8\u201312 before you go off watch at 0400, will you? They should see the coast at 48 miles by mid-day. The 2nd Mate decided to warm it up a bit earlier though, and as the picture cleared around 0200, there was the coastline dead ahead\u2026 That required some severe \u201cflogging of the log\u201d to avoid the final day\u2019s passage being at some 57 knots\u2026 ",
