            "answer_text": "Is racism an issue in France? Not really toward minorities : that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist, but that it\u2019s much more latent than actually expressed. Among white French, the dislike toward people of color in our country is quite a casual subject of conversation. When colored people are involved, we all become much more tolerant, first and foremost out of both sense of civism and cordiality (we know well to differentiate passion and reason, emotions and reflexions) and for the really racist elements, to avoid any necessary confrontation leading either to a fight, either to the police station and why not tribunal. Exemple of stereotypes :Black people are libeled to smell bad, and to have cockroaches at home -> that can be seen as cultural rejection, but also as racism.Arabs are libeled dishonest, stealing, and unreliable : common idea is to keep them in front of you, never in your back -> that is mostly cultural rejectionAll-out racist caricatures (\u201cthey are coming from the tree\u201d) are mostly turned in derision nowadays : we are all coming from the tree at some point.We have millions of Arabs and Black people, and dozen of thousands of recent Roma, Albanians, and Middle-Eastern migrants, for example, and yet, very few \u201cracially\u201d motivated violent incidents every-year toward them relatively to their population (let alone ours), part of them happening during police operations, these categories of immigrants and descendants of immigrants being more prone to criminality than the rest of the population not only because of their skin-color when different than ours which lead them to be discriminated, but mostly due to their below-average integration in the society, below-average living standards.Ordinary discriminations are much more common, but not irreversible. Usually, a formal complaints about it, may it be toward and individual, company, or administration, or a proof leaked on a social-media will give the desired effect : apologies at first, sometimes indemnisation of the moral prejudice if we speak about formal procedures.Their partial islamization (except for the Roma) also lead many of them to disrespect the French Law as inferior (the Roma are basically running away from any form of Law, and just want to be left alone), care only about their community, this when they actually do so : often, they don\u2019t even care about the good precepts of their religion, and only use it as a \u201cweaponized form of communautarism\u201d emboldening their non-civic attitude. And the fact that many descendants of immigrants are outstanding citizens in our country doesn\u2019t change that many others are not.As you can already guess, the main issue is not racism per-se, but basic culturalocentrism of the French people, a thing happening here like in other countries of the World, without happening as much as in many other countries of the World : for all its flaws and lacks, France provide a chance and safe condition of life for all its citizens, and if the getthoisation of the immigrant populations and their precarious conditions of life are real, they have nothing to do with what is actually happening in their countries of origin : they are way safer, richer, more free and with more opportunities here than there.Hence, despite our faulty assimilation and integration process, the white-French are tired of hearing so much about \u201cracism\u201d and be systematically labelled as the perpetrators : the minorities are racist also, and because of their \u201cspecially protected status\u201d, both encouraged to complain about what is done to them and play victim when they actually do so themselves.The common stereotypes about our visible minorities is \u201cthey are much more racist than we are\u201d. I personally agree with that. If we white French were 6 to 7 millions in France, and these minorities were 60 millions, I think we\u2019d end up in enclaves like the Serbs in Kosovo & Metochia, or even exterminated if the circumstances allowed.Here comes the other side of racism : the racism of visible / ethnic minorities against the white French majority : For every \u201cSale Arabe\u201d (Dirty Arab) or \u201cSale N\u00e8gre\u201d (Dirty negro) you can find on a French city wall, a \u201cSale fran\u00e7ais\u201d (Dirty French) or \u201cNique la France\u201d (fuck France) will answer to it, and yet, for one of the minority, there\u2019s 10 of us white French for now.Anti-visible minorities discriminations (Anti-whoever racism, Islamophobia, Homophobia) are widely commented, shamed, and punished by law ; but anti-French or anti-White discourses are perfectly ok : some white French even speak that way against their own kind in support of minorities they do not belong to because conform to the caricatured ideal of our civic-nationalism, it\u2019s hence politically correct and political correctness give them a sense to belong in the right side of History. Is that racism of self ?Some minorities (Algerians first and foremost, but also all Islamized ones) don\u2019t hesitate to \u201csecure themselves\u201d buildings, streets, or even whole neighborhoods in which white French, including cops, are not welcome unless they are totally submitted or crooked. \u201cThis place is ours\u201d (I\u2019d answer to that : \u201cUntil we decide otherwise\u2026\u201d). Is that racism ?The media became more and more silent about those phenomena, and try to elude their cause : the culprits are depicted as \u201cyoung without purpose\u201d, \u201csmall imbeciles\u201d, while they are actually radicalized communities of immigrants and their descendants who refuse the Law of the French Republic, let alone to assimilate to the French culture of even nation, except when it\u2019s about demanding social-aids (everybody is 100% French in that case). Is that endorsement of racism ?In these neighborhoods, it\u2019s culturally hype (and sometimes related to genuine events) to mention to \u201cbang a little White (female)\u201d, \u201ctake turns on her\u201d, \u201cstick inside her some big Arab/Negro cock\u201d, \u201cknock her up with a little Arab/Negro\u201d, etc, etc. Is that racism ?The white young women are \u201cprivileged\u201d targets, because using them sexually in degrading condition is perceived as some kind of catharsis for events the perpetrators didn\u2019t live through, but yet sponged the hatred and intellectually catalyzed it, especially because the French Hip-Hop scene relays all these phantasm and realities all-together and make them trendy, with the complicity of white French businessmen smelling the money to make on that subculture. Is that a form of \u201ccapitalist racism\u201d ?The minorities adhering to this kind of anti-White and mysoginistic sub-culture should be aware that they are lucky to be in a country as moderate as France is. To speak about our ethnic women like that, let alone follow through with action, would grant you a place in mass graves in different times\u2026 or lands. And hence moderate their behavior and atone for the misdeeds already done, instead of barking for more and keep going.At the end, while the French global companies backed by the French government continue post-colonial policies in Africa in the well-known war for resources and profit, the French people and related institutions endlessly apologize for the colonial-crimes of the past, shun their own secular Christian heritage or white European character, and promote our own aliens, if not enemies, that abuse us AND despise us at the same time so often, when it\u2019s not all out hatred. Honestly, even if the French people is mildly racist and quite culturalocentrist, we did a lot of efforts as a people to both atone for our State\u2019s sins and give our minorities both good condition of life and a sense of respect that they sometimes don\u2019t even have for themselves : a trait that we know widely share with the out of the extend of our pro-minorities and pro-integration policies. So, if people living in our oversea territories, Africa or Maghreb can still form historical complaints toward us, they should not forget that we decolonized 60 years ago : what has been done in our former colonies since then, and by whom ? Is that only \u201cus\u201d, or is it also \u201cthem\u201d who cause trouble ? As for those who live in France, they should stop breaking our balls with racism, and be grateful about what is now given to them, instead of complaining about the past or the fate of countries they would never go to nor would accept them, and crying then for more while feeding with their numbers our police-stations, tribunals, prisons, their radical mosques and even some terrorist organizations abroad with extensions within our territories. France is still an European country, the country of the ethnic French people of European descent and culture, first and foremost, and that will change only with the plain assimilation of our \u201ccolored minorities\u201d, whatever political correctness or even our ideology of civic-nationalism might say and glose about it. And what we expect is assimilation, not integration : due to our History and now our collective mindset, we are culturalocentrist much more than ethnocentrist, let alone racists, and hence focused on cultural-nationalism much more than on ethnic one, beyond our claim of sole civic-one. Assimilate, and you will not find a lot of racists in France to complain about it : we welcome those who genuinely do as brothers and sisters. Don\u2019t, and we\u2019ll endure, until the matter is solved one way or another : our home will always be our home. In the meantime, if non-Europeans French citizens and of course residents are not happy in France, they can always go back to the ancestral country they identify to, and see how they fare there : we won\u2019t likely miss those.

            "answer_text": "Is racism in France a problem? That's a big question!!!! I am afraid to say yes, because some people think it does not exist, but it is palpable. We do not recognize community rights in France. For instance, you would never have a day off for Ramadan or any other religious holiday, except the Catholic religion. But, in other respects, we are treated as separate. It depends on everyone's point of view, but I would say that not everyone has the same opportunity to succeed. For instance, there are enclaves within suburbs called zone d\u2019education prioritaire (ZEP). These zones have meager resources. If you graduate high school from a ZEP, your chances to get accepted into a prestigious university will be much lower. If you immigrate from a poor country and you require social assistance, you will be placed in a neighborhood full of people like you. The result is that there is a ghettofication of neighborhoods by country of origin: Mali, Guinea, Algeria, etc. These neighborhoods tend to be full of crime and gang activity. People who grow up in these localities feel marginalized by society and are susceptible to being recruited by jihadists. We are really considered French only when we perform heroic acts like saving a child from death, but if the child had fallen Mamadou Gassama was attempting to save him, he would have remained African. We are French when we save people in a store during a terrorist attack, but before this, our requests for citizenship get denied several times. I myself faced this case. I was born in France, but most of my life was spent outside this dear France. I returned to my native country when I was 21. To my surprise, I was told that I was no longer a citizen, because I grew up outside the country and had not resided in France before turning 18. Who could have imagined that in the country in which I was born, I would have needed a residence permit to circulate freely or work, that I would have stayed in jail for two nights because I was not recognized as a child of the country? I was not claiming to be of Gaulish ancestry. All I was asking for was a recognition of my citizenship, on account of having been born here. ",
