You should try watching YouTube videos and of course you'll get better the more you just relax and play. If I had to guess it'll take 20-50 hours to feel confident in the game. You got to put a lot of time into it, not just something you can expect to be good at from the get go. ",

The best say to get the hang of it imo is either watch Arumba\u2019s old games of it where he demonstrates many of the games features or just fiddle around with it yourself for awhile while reading some of the guides on steam.
