            "answer_text": "Logistics has always been tricky. There were several methods: Carry supplies from depots.Steal/confiscate supplies.Trade supplies.I read that the Assyrians were the first to master this skill, but I have no definite source. However, the Romans and the Feudal Japanese had methods. Whatever the civilisation, the general theme would be that the army would start off with supplies that would last a certain amount of time. If possible, it would restock from supply depots and from friendly communities. Once it reached enemy territory, it would be less inclined to trade and more likely to just take what it needed. The army may be willing to be lenient to try and get the native population on side or it may not care about the native population in the slightest. If supplies were managed properly, then there would be enough to support thousands. If not, the results would be devastating. Here\u2019s some quotes: PLUTARCH: He fought by stamping on the enemy\u2019s stomach. CAESAR: Some\u2026 said that they did not dead the enemy, but feared the narrowness of the roads and the vastness of the forests and that the supplies could not be readily enough. TACITUS: Nothing distressed our troops so much as the scarcity of supplies. [Matyszak, 2011, pp145, 147]. I know that the Duke of Wellington ordered troops to pay for supplies to ensure that the British army was more popular than the enemy forces. Here\u2019s some sourced data:  SAM61 Ashigaru with rice bails.These were not only supplies but were used for barricades, Perry Miniatures The Japanese would sometimes employ so many logistical staff that there\u2019d be more of them than actual soldiers, perhaps 60% [Turnbull, 2012, p111]. The army, whether 10 people or, as the question asks, several thousands, will start off by carrying baggage. This may include packhorses, bearers, and ox-drawn carts. This may carry 10 days supply of food and fodder. If the enemy has used scorched-earth, this may be the only way to keep supplied. Otherwise, the army will organise foraging and cash payment, with looting only acceptable in enemy territory. Even then, the army may be cautious and try to get the farmers to join their side. Still, samurai and ashigaru were ready to use torture [Ibid, pp118\u2013119].  AB Figures: 15mm Marching Legionaries, Mule Trains & Baggage Wagons The Romans would work in a similar way to the Japanese. They made sure legionnaires had a weeks supply of food each carried in their packs [Matyszak, 2011, p145]. In the field, the army would have some stockpiles, mobile food supplies, and packed meals. The stockpiles were prepared in advance, the mobile food supplies were herds of cattle (that could also supply glue), and the packed meals were grain and cured meat [Ibid, pp145\u2013146]. On the march, the Romans typically had the baggage train in the centre and the best troops behind them. There should also be flank guards and the servants should be trained in what to do in battle [Webster, 1985, p234]. After this runs out, becomes monotonous, or becomes unsuitable for soldiers working hard, foragers would look for fresh meat and perhaps vegetables. The enemy civilians may have already evacuated, so the auxiliaries can just find what they need. This may include the food people may need to survive in winter [Matyszak, pp146\u2013147]. Cavalry and infantry would protect this convoy [Ibid, pp147\u2013148]. Matyszak adds that the Macedonians once tried to set fire to a Roman camp as it had looted so much flammable grain [Ibid, p147]. There was also a possibility of soldiers hunting wild animals, perhaps even more so with an increase in German units in the third century [Webster, 1985, pp263\u2013264].  Hospitaller Sergeant - 54mm (Pegaso) (2006) | Crusades | Armor clothing, Medieval knight, Knight The Hospitallers used packhorses to form supply trains. These packhorses were cheaper than riding horses [Nicolle, 2001, p48].

However, foraging for food and water and taking it from local populations, either by purchase or confiscation, we're also options. ",
