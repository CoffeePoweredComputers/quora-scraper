            "answer_text": "It wasn\u2019t a new religion. Two sects of Judaism survived the destruction of the Second Temple, because those two sects didn\u2019t require the Temple to maintain connection to their faith. One was the Pharisaical sect, which relied upon regular prayer and penitence as a substitute for Temple sacrifice. This evolved into the Talmud and today\u2019s Judaism. One was the Messianic sect, which believed that the mashiach of Judaism had already incarnated and died for their sins as the Mashiach Ben-Yosef or \u201cMessiah son of Joseph,\u201d also known as the Suffering Servant. By bringing the Holy Spirit and having it dwell within those who believed, the body of each believer would serve as the new Temple. This became the Body of Christ and today\u2019s Christianity. But until the third or fourth century A.D. these weren\u2019t separate faiths - just separate schools of thought about the same faith. It was John Chrysostom\u2019s homilies, political conditions in the third and fourth centuries, and irreconcilable theological differences that separated the two branches into different faiths. Ultimately they\u2019re still based on the same faith. They just have very, very different ideas about who the Messiah is and what their personal obligations are. ",

            "answer_text": "Jesus was Jewish but there is no religion called Jewish. Jewish largely refers to being of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Around Jesus\u2019 time it could also refer to a person living in the nation of Judah, later called Judea. To be Jewish in modern times means to follow a certain set of rituals and customs, and sometimes laws. There is no spiritual faith mandate to be called Jewish, as it is purely a cultural pronoun. The faith of the followers of the God of Abraham is called Judaism. Jesus did not create a new religion/faith. He both clarified the mistakes that had been made since the time of Moses, and as the promised messiah, introduced the promised new covenant from our creator. Christians are practicing what could be called Judaism under the new covenant from God. As sometimes happens in Judaism, many Christians fall into practicing faith under their own (or their leaders own) worldly (often selfish) interpretation, and thus become Christian in name only. Jesus told us this would happen. Thus we have a situation where Christianity and Judaism each think the other has gone astray - but are generally the same faith. Jews often try to separate Christianity from Judaism insisting it is another religion all together. This is not a correct ideology. They are the same faith to the same God, with different beliefs about how to know/return to Him. Ultimately if you are confused about which belief system is true, you should pray to God with a pure and honest heart - and ask for discernment. ",
