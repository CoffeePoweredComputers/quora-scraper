            "answer_text": "As a second-generation Canadian of East Indian descent, speaking purely from experience, I would say this: Just let your kids be kids. It\u2019s really that simple. It\u2019s not rocket science. Don\u2019t put pressure on them to fully \u201cassimilate\u201d into what you may consider the \u201chost\u201d culture or to memorize every passage of the religious/holy book of your own \u201chome\u201d culture or society. Childhood and adolescence is confusing and traumatic enough without having to deal with zealous, overbearing parents imploring their kids to abide by bizarre, arbitrarily determined rules and expectations, lest they will somehow not be accepted into society or will be a \u201cshame on the family\u201d, depending on one\u2019s point of view. I disagree with other Quorans here who claim that you have to \u201cfind a balance\u201d between two, supposedly juxtaposing, milieus and/or cultures, in the context of a Western upbringing. Contrary to what many people may claim or try to portray (usually, I find, for some sinister political purposes), Western societies tend to be fairly progressive, open and tolerant. That\u2019s precisely why many foreigners see countries like Canada and the US to be \u201csafe havens\u201d or \u201cshining cities on a hill\u201d, to borrow a famous quote from President Reagan. Of course, you\u2019re going to have people who see your kids as \u201cIndian\u201d, \u201cChinese\u201d, \u201cLatino\u201d, \u201cAfrican\u201d, or whatever it may be. However, rest assured, such attitudes are fairly isolated and well on the decline. And, in most progressive and diverse urban centres, such a focus on racial or ethnic identity wouldn\u2019t be just frowned upon, but ridiculed as well. For example, I have lived in the famously diverse Greater Toronto Area for my entire life. Although I have had many discussions about my ethnic heritage with many friends, co-workers, teachers, professors, etc., I have hardly ever been regarded as an \u201cIndian\u201d person and expected to conform to stereotypes as to how a typical \u201cIndian\u201d person should comport himself. If anything, the only few people who have really cared about whether or not I am \u201cIndian\u201d enough are those who share my ethnic background, not those outside of it. And, frankly, between the two of us, they\u2019re not exactly the brightest thinkers, but that\u2019s a separate discussion for another day. So, just make sure that your kids\u2019 childhoods are filled with play, adventure and excitement. As they grow up, they will develop their own identities and means of relating to their ethnic background. However this takes place, as long as your kids are happy, well-adjusted and intellectually curious, there\u2019s nothing to sweat. They\u2019ll be respected amongst their peers first and foremost as people, not as \u201cIndians\u201d, \u201cAfricans\u201d, \u201cIrish\u201d, \u201cChinese\u201d, etc. by default. Best of luck! Hope this helps a bit. ",

You do not need to asimilate 100% but the more you do the easier it will be for your kids to fit in as they grow up. They can still be proud of their heritage, culture, and customs of course, america specifically is very accepting of other cultures (despite all the sensationalized BS you hear about racism in the news). I mean there is still a chance you will encounter some racism on occasion, but it\u2019s definitely not as bad as CNN makes it out to be. I think for the most part americans will really only have an issue with you if you are here illegally OR are the type of selfish/narrow-minded immigrant that emigrates here and then REFUSES to assimilate/respect other cultures but demand that everyone else change/conform to fit yours. Other than that, I think if you can find a way to come to terms with any/all culture differences, you and your family will have the opportunity to able to be just as happy/successful as anyone else here can be.

            "answer_text": "You have to do a balancing act between being Indian and being American. (I\u2019m just taking Indian as a shorthand, but you can replace with any immigrant group). Many parents slide too much on one side. My son was born in the US and while I lived in the US I tried to expose him to the good parts of the American culture. I myself grew quite fascinated with the American culture [not the Hollywood type] and spent time with local families during Christmas and Thanksgiving. I used to take my son to local libraries and play gyms with a lot of diversity and avoided getting him pinned to just his birth ethnicity. You have to make sure that the child fits with the American culture and its varied traits. He/she needs to have friends with other races, be able to appreciate its history and in general play well with the melting pot. At the same time, you cannot forget that your kid is a brown kid. No matter what the passport says or what you believe, he/she will be an Indian American [at best] rather than an American. Locals would call them an \u201cIndian gentleman\u201d or lady when they mention a positive encounter with them [Oh, I had this Indian doctor, he was extremely good. Oh, the petite Asian lady at the store, she has a great smile\u2026]. And you have to embrace that. You can try to call them as racists or whine in social media, but nothing will change. Like our Piyush [Bobby Jindal] you can even change name, religion, beliefs and lighten up your skin tone in paintings, but you will be seen as a brown guy. [Bobby Jindal on portrait: 'I'm not white?'] In short, do not try to ditch either of the two identities. That will put undue pressure on the child. Connect them with our culture, language, religion etc. Make them a bridge connecting different traditions. Bring the best of each culture to the table and let him/her flower into the third culture [Indian American]. ",

            "answer_text": "You really don't know which way its going to be, so let your kids just be. I\u2019m a second generation immigrant from South India. I was born there then I moved to California when I was two years old. When I graduated high school, my parents then pushed me to study abroad in India for my undergraduate lasting 4 years. After graduation, I moved back (also with parental influence) to California and I\u2019m now an employed citizen of America! And firstly, just to make things clear, I\u2019m not going to argue over which place is better or which culture is better. Because its simply a petty argument, that goes on for days and leads to nowhere. All throughout my life, I had my peers pointing at how backwards, ignorant and \u201cfob\u201d Indian culture was. Ironically, these same people were so close minded that when I came back from India, they inherently assumed my life was miserable and sad. I also had people tell me how uncultured and \u201cbad\u201d American culture was. These same people taught me to succumb to fear and question my choices. If anything, I\u2019ve learned that both sides can learn from each other, and in it's true nature there\u2019s huge similarities between the thought processes of Eastern and Western cultures. After all, we\u2019re all human. But, that\u2019s another discussion. My point being, in the end, (and after months of therapy) I chose not to follow a label. And it\u2019s important you give your child the same opportunity. Don\u2019t label them. If your from India, you don\u2019t have to call them Indian, or Indian-American, or American, or Indian-Canadian (I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there). Just let them be who they are. Yes, balancing is one option. Although, balancing is also very very hard. After all they're just children. Grow them up with ethics and let their true personality emerge. There will be a thousand labels out there, let your child know he or she doesn't need to be caught up in them. Be the role model you want them to follow. As I said, I\u2019m not here to tell you to be in sync with your original culture, Western or balance both. But if you want your child to follow something the best you can do is to exemplify that \"something\". Note: I\u2019m taking a pause here. Because I want to be clear with what I said. I\u2019m saying be the role model you wish to see in them, but DO NOT FORCE THEM TO BE YOU. There\u2019s a very big difference. If you\u2019d like your kid to assimilate, then you should show them how to implement assimilation. Whether that means learning Western dishes, expressing through Western music, etc, etc. If you\u2019d like your kid to remain to your original culture, be a role model to the values your culture holds closely, invite them to celebrate your culture\u2019s festivals, etc etc. If you\u2019d like your kid to balance both, then show them how to do that. Be a Westerner outside and practice your culture at home. Whatever you do, don\u2019t command them to assimilate, stay true to your culture, or find a way make the balance, show them how it can be done. Commanding or forcing them will only cause further resentment. Children learn a lot from the behavior of their parents. If you show respect to both cultures, the chances your child will too are high. Introduce ideologies, don\u2019t force them. I think this touches the topic of religion/no religion. I was brought up a Hindu and I am a follower of it spiritually. The ideologies resonate with me on a deep level. I was introduced to it as a child, however it was entirely my choice to delve into it. Which is why I think its perfectly fine to introduce your cultural or religious/non-religious norms to your child, as long as you're not forcefully instilling them and thereby hurting the child. But, if your child is never introduced to your original cultural/religious/non-religious norms theres no way he or she can follow it. Raise them to be INDEPENDENT THINKERS You have the perfect opportunity to teach your child how to be an independent thinker. Ask them to question things. Question both sides of an argument. It's important for them to formulate their own opinions. Ofcourse in the beginning they'll need help from you. But as they grow let them see the world in their eyes which will be much more global. Teach them to formulate opinions through research and experience rather than follow immediate instincts or gossip. There will be millions of people out there trying to pull your child to their opinions. Don't allow them to get swayed away. Teach them why you think your customs are valuable, but give them the freedom to see through to that. Don't be hard on yourself. As I mentioned in the beginning, you don't know how your kid might turn out. So don't hurt yourself if your child doesn't follow the same patterns or customs as you did. If you portrayed and showed respect to your customs and cultures well, the chances your kid will follow are high. However, day by day the world becomes connected and globalised in different ways. The amount of influence you have can be high or low. Don't beat yourself over it. In the end, I would say be patient and understand where your child is coming from. And help them understand where you might be coming from. Allow open and meaningful relationships to help discuss cultural problems they may be facing. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "As an immigrant one needs to maintain the balance between the two cultures. For acceptance in the US society, your children needs to learn and understand the local culture. They need to blend in with other children irrespective of their color or race or religion. Since your child will be having American friends, you as a parent also need to learn general social customs of the society. But at the same time your roots are in your home country. I believe parents should keep their children connected to their roots. Because that is their true identity and that will stick to them through out their life. I believe that the balanced understanding of both the cultures will help your children ingest a sense of confidence in the US society and a sense of pride and empathy for their homeland. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Corporal punishment, as is common in other cultures and societies, is not acceptable here. It can, depending on 1. The severity, 2. The type, and 3. Who is taking notice of it, lead to you being jailed and your children removed from you. I suggest you read up on this, and learn acceptable alternatives and solutions, before tragedy befalls. I don\u2019t know where you are from, or what you consider reasonable (for all I know, you could already follow a Western style pattern of discipline); but conversely, something you consider mundane and common in your home country could, without you meaning to, rip your family apart. We take this seriously, on the whole, here. ",
