            "answer_text": "England was massively affected by the Norman Conquest. It was the last successful invasion of mainland Britain, and left us with the Royal Family that we have today. All the old English aristocracy was replaced by Normans loyal to William, giving him immense power over his newly conquered territory.Moreover, many Anglo-Saxons fled abroad, meaning that the Normans strengthened their position by physically removing those not willing to subject themselves to the new rulers.The Domesday book shows that 95% of the land south of the Tees was owned by the Normans as a result.Anglo-Norman became the language spoken by the majority, as the nobility all spoke French, whilst the the lower orders spoke Old English. Overtime, these merged into the language we have today.French names became common, such as William, Robert, and Richard.Surprisingly, few place names changed, instead remaining with the \u201coriginal\u201d given by the Scandinavian settlers.Old English was the result of Briton, Saxon, Angle influences, showing how the successive invasions changed England.As mentioned above, the current Queen is descended from William the Conqueror, meaning that all subsequent rulers of England from 1066 were in power because of the Conquest.",

            "answer_text": "it seems after the conquest the local population of Anglo-Saxons never had the gumption to drive the foreign invaders out. the Chinese were able to drive out the Mongol invaders in a bit over 90 years but the English are still ruled by a foreign dynasty. admittedly the new dynasty isn\u2019t Norman. when the Brits did finally dump their monarch they were so put off by Oliver\u2019s \u201crepublic\u201d they brought another foreign dynasty back to rule. how sad is that? how much of this was the result of the Norman invasion is an interesting question.
