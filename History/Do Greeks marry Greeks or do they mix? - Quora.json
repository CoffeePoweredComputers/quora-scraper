            "answer_text": "This is an addendum to Nick Nicholas\u2019 answer. Upvote his and come back for some details. Greeks do tend to be quite endogamous. That was especially prevalent vis-a-vis particular ethnicities. In the areas of Macedonia and Thrace it was akin to treason to marry a Bulgarian (in my peoples\u2019 minds this includes Slavs in the fYROM) until the 80s at least. Later it was not talked about openly but both sides knew it. I remember teasing a Bulgarian friend in the 90s and telling him that if he wanted to learn to speak fluently he just needed to marry a Greek girl. There were plenty of Greek students in Bulgaria to choose from. He stopped, looked at me and asked me point blank \u201cWhat Greek girl would marry a Bulgarian guy, especially if she came from N. Greece. If she went home to announce it to the family, she would never come back*\u201d. I swallowed my tongue, as we say in Greek. There was no answer because he was absolutely right. Later in the 90s there were a lot of marriages between older Greek men and younger women from Eastern Europe. Marriages of convenience on both sides, they were looked down upon and many an ugly family quarrel has taken place because of it. There is still often a suspicion that such marriages are little more than a financial arrangement. Among the younger crowd and especially since Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU attitudes have relaxed. Their passports are as good as ours, they don\u2019t need a work permit and there is little financial advantage in marrying a Greek. The taboo is just now and very slowly starting to relax against Albania. But it is still there, as evidenced by the existence of a theater play \u201cIn laws from Tirana\u201d. However, since the second and third generation Albanians in Greece can\u2019t really be distinguished from the natives, unless they want to, I see them being gradually assimilated. It is more of a class distinction, anyway. To marry a well-to-do educated Albanian wouldn\u2019t really matter. Same for Turks, but due to the different religion these are extremely rare. Regarding other people in Europe there is an upward trend of intermarriage within the EU. Marrying anybody in the EU won\u2019t even be looked upon with any kind of curiosity in Greece. However, judging from the people I know Greeks, even the 20\u201330 yo well educated new diaspora that have moved and live abroad, tend to stick together and marry their own, even today when there is no social pressure to do so. I have no answer as to why, as I never felt the need to be among Greeks when abroad, but it is obvious that for some people it is \u2026reassuring? comforting? I am waiting for the opinion of the younger diaspora, to find out why they do it and to what measure. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on where and when, of course. In Australia 40 years ago: almost never intermarried. In Australia now: often do intermarry; intermarriage exceeded 50% some time in the last ten years. In Greece a century ago: almost never intermarried. There weren\u2019t a lot of non-Greeks around to marry (depending on your definition of non-Greek, of course; I\u2019m taking an expansive one). Now: less so. Of course, that answer is a commonplace. More concretely: Greeks are by default endogamous in diasporas: they are rather attached to maintaining their cultural identity in the face of what they see as an external threat. Unusually so, compared with other migrant groups. That gets mitigated by various interrelated factors. Size of settlement: small Maniat settlements in Italy in the 17th century assimilated rather readily.Local authority figures: the colony in Corsica did not assimilate in the critical first two generations, because they had a monasteryful of monks and several chieftains with them, urging them to stay Greek Orthodox.Time: the second generation of Greek Australians didn\u2019t intermarry; the third did.Sense of threat: the Greeks that migrated from Corsica and Mani to New Smyrna Beach, Florida were a minority of the settlers; the majority were Minorcans (especially once malaria got the Maniots). In New Smyrna, it was the Minorcans and the Greco-Corsicans against the cruelty of Andrew Turnbull. In Corsica, the Greeks were at constant war with the Catholic Corsicans for another three generations; in Florida, the same Greeks intermarried with the Minorcans immediately. The Minorcans weren\u2019t the threat any more; the English were.",
