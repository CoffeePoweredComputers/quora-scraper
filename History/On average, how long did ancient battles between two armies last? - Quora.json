            "answer_text": "Depends on the environment and conditions around the battle. If it\u2019s open field and one army plays their cards right or one is under-prepared then the battle could last for an hour or maybe a few hours. ((If you include other factors like chasing and routing then this could be longer/make up a large portion of the time)) Some battles however could last for days like Thermopylae where the phalanx of the Spartans and other Greeks at a narrow passage held off the Persians for three days until eventually the Persians with the help of Ephialtes found another way through resulting in the Greeks defeat. If you count sieges among a battle of two armies ((seeing how ones trying to get into the city)) then it could last for days or even weeks. If you count in factors around the place being siege the time it takes could be shorter or longer. Siege of Constantinople was around 53 days and others like the Siege of Orleans exceeded 200. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the armies. Many battles were over with very quickly \u2013 less than an hour \u2013 because one army wasn't nearly as good as the opposition. But I would imagine that to roughly equally trained Greek phalanxes could go on for quite a long time. And the battle of Hastings was distinctly unusual in that it lasted eight hours. Two relatively well-trained and relatively equal enemies. ",
