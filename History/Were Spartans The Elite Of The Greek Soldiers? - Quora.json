            "answer_text": "Before Alexander Magno or after?Sparta was weakened after the war of the Peloponnese,what allowed them to the final win was the fact that the plague hit Athens causing the city state to lose its army.Whilst Alexander and Phillip both decided that Spartan power was negligible,during Alexander\u2019s invasion of Anatolia the Spartans did try to raise revolt with the army of other city states,but the loss of manpower suggests that mayhap only the aged and infirm could muster,The revolt,funded no less by the satrap of one of the many patty rulers of Anatolia gave the needed funds,Alexander\u2019s deputy,Antipater considered it so neglible that he took care of another revolt.The Spartans were allowed to grab allies antipater turned his attention to them (his army had an advantaged of 2to 1 in his favour)and the ensuing battle of Megaopolis which utterly destroyed Sparta and Alexander once apprised of the battle,called \u201cA battle of mice\u201d. Another and better example of an elite military as we understand it,a small group used to being placed in the thick of the fighting were the Sacred Band of Thebes.This band composed of homosexual lover were famous for never breaking as all had a stake in its winning it was also broken by Phillip in the battle of Chaeronia in 335 b.c..These troops composed of 150 pairs of lovers at from the scanty and sometimes lost evidence fought with chariot and spearman.

            "answer_text": " I\u2019d say the Carian mercenaries would have been Greeks most elite fighters for hire (from around 1400\u2013800BCE) but were not Greeks themselves, they likely taught Spartans how to fight in battle formations and were considered the most disciplined fighters by Greeks, noting they are full-time soldiers in a time when Sparta had not yet implemented military academies. They lived on Delos and adjacent island before being driven out from the islands and settled on Caria which is where they get there name from. They were likely paid annually in head of herd by islands at a festival to Apollo, which does appear to be recorded on the flotilla (south wall) and shipwreck (north wall) fresco for services rendered as shown below, click to zoom.  This seal shows a Cretian athElite on the left, Carian in the right. This same scene is shown in many Minoan seals. It takes a Minoan bull-leaping athElite, to jump over the Carian shield wall to break their ranks, two Cretan foot soldiers are shown on the floor, the attrition rate is high, the Carians fought as a military unit. They invented, battle dances (military drill), horse-hair helmet plumes, and many shield innovations. They provided soldiers and crew for Minos navy, but were driven out of the islands by Minos and likely fought for those that paid them. They are more like marines in Minoan times, small detachment on ships. It is possible that if they encountered plain (wooden) hulls in their territorial waters: boarded, inspected cargo and probably levied duty. Minoan ships are white hulls, so it is easy to identify non-Minoan vessels. This scene may represent a civil war before they relocated to Caria.   Carians fought as a military unit. Further details on battle dances.  ",
