            "answer_text": "The two are remarkable similar in many ways as they were both professional entertainers whose functions were very similar to that of courtesans. While both are often associated with prostitution, and there were indeed cases of both providing sexual services for their cliental, this association is a more modern one that began after the arrival of Western powers. But this is about differences, so let\u2019s begin!  Differences in Origin: While geisha are considerably better known beyond their native country, it may come to a surprise that their role is significantly younger than that of the kisaeng by around seven hundred years. Geisha first appeared in Japan around the beginning of the 18th and originally it was a position held by men, not women. Geisha were not originally meant to be courtesans but mere entertainers, providing a backdrop of music or dance while customers paid to spend time with oiran, who were in some ways the forerunners of the geisha. By the end of the 18th century, women had generally taken over the role of geisha. Though they were never meant to be the main attraction of courtesan houses, the changing taste of the clients shifted from the very ornate and proper oiran to the more subdued and approachable geisha.  Oiran, who are strikingly similar in appearance to geisha. The origin of kisaeng, on the other hand, is much less clear. Though it\u2019s known that they had been around in Korea since the 10th century, they have often been neglected by historians due to the country being strongly influenced by Confucianism, which did not have kind opinions on either women or entertainers. The appearance of kisaeng, however, coincides with the dramatic increase of Confucianism in the country as well as the jarring drop of autonomy that women in Korea previously enjoyed. Social Status: The position that geisha occupied within the social status of the Japanese caste system is somewhat a mystery and seems to be, for the most part, undefined. While it\u2019s safe to assume they did not belong to the burakumin (the untouchable class), they did not easily fit any of the other class descriptions either. If I had to guess, each geisha probably retained whatever social rank they were born into, with their occupation having no effect at all. (If someone knows otherwise, leave a comment and I\u2019d be happy to make a correction) The status of kisaeng, however, was much more clearly defined by the Korean government. Belonging to the cheonmin, they were a part of the lowest class in premodern Korean society other than the nobi (slaves). By the 17th century, however, all kisaeng were designated as government slaves until the Gabo reform in 1894. Despite their very low status, kisaeng were considerably better educated than most of the nations population, men and women alike. As such, they commanded an unusual amount of respect for their class from not only commoners, but the middle class as well. Training and Ranks: For both geisha and kisaeng, training usually began during childhood, typically as early as age six or eight, though girls in the early teens could also be accepted. Also true for both, any daughter born to either a geisha or kisaeng almost always became as such themselves, essentially being born into the profession. For geisha, training took place in what is called an okiya, essentially a lodging house in which geisha lived in. The house would provide the expenses for living and training, but each geisha was contractually obligated to eventually pay back all expenses after they \u201cdebuted\u201d (i.e. began to officially work). Thus, long after training, many geisha had to remain in their okiya until their debt was fulfilled. Though they originally worked in the pleasure districts, geisha eventually were given their own districts called hanamachi where okiya would typically be located. The okiya themselves were funded by associated tea-houses, where the geisha would entertain clients.  As \u201cokiya\u201d were not meant to entertain clients, they were relatively unremarkable compared to their surroundings. Apprentices were referred to as maiko, who were well known for wearing makeup and kimino\u2019s much more ornate than fully trained geisha, who are referred to as geiko. The reason for this was because maiko were generally not permitted to interact direction with clients, instead observing the geiko\u2019s interactions as a part of the training and provide entertainment by performing music or dances. Thus, the more ornate appearance was to make up for their lack of conversation. After spending a few years training in dance and playing the shamisen along with other skills, maiko would graduate and become a geiko, typically no older than the age of 20. After a geisha had paid off their debt to the okiya, she could either continue to work at the okiya to help with training new maiko or work independently if she was financially stable or had managed to secure a danna (more on the later). I am not aware of any age limit for geisha and assume they could retire at any time after their debts were repaid. For kisaeng, the process could be slightly different. For most, training was similar to that of a geisha in that initiates were placed in kibangs, or kisaeng houses, and would be mentored by the experienced kisaeng already working there. The most skilled kisaeng, however, were produced from what was called gyobang, which was essentially an academy for teaching advanced dances and court music. The primary purpose of the gyobang was to produce kisaeng with the specific purpose of performing for the royal court. Once training was over, kisaeng would begin work at an assigned gibang or an assigned government posting, though some might work at inns on busy travel routes.  A photo of a \u201cgwonbeon,\u201d another type of kisaeng school that replaced the \u201cgyobang\u201d system during the Japanese annexation period. Unlike geisha, kisaeng had a very strict hierarchy organized into three ranks. Haengsu were the highest, having always trained at a gyobang and could therefore perform for the royal court and perform the most complicated dances and songs, were allowed to choose and refuse their clients, and would eventually be charged with running gibangs and overseeing the training of new kisaeng. Seonsang made up the middle rank, having also received training at a gyobang and were also allowed to perform for the court, though usually only in supporting roles for the haengsu. Samsu were the lowest rank, as they likely did not receive training at a gyobang and were not allowed to perform the same songs and dances as haengsu. Kisaeng assigned to government postings (such as magistrate offices or military based) were given an entirely separate designation: gwangi. In addition to their entertainment duties, gwangi also acted as secretaries and housekeepers for the officers at their posts.  A \u201cgibang\u201d usually consisted of an enclosed group of buildings that included a pavilion for banquets and a large open courtyard for larger performances. Kisaeng also faced significantly more government regulation. Though they were not confined to any specific wards like geisha, they had to regularly check in with a hojong, an officer charged with monitoring and keeping a consensus of the kisaeng. In order to move to another district or province, kisaeng would have to put in a request with this officers to get approval first. Kisaeng were also often required to report to the gyobang for additional training in regional skills and to ensure the quality of those they already held. Beyond this, however, kisaeng generally governed themselves, with the gyobang often acting as their administrative office. Skills and Arts: Geisha and kisaeng had very similar talents for the most part, including performing tea ceremonies, reading and writing poetry, dance and playing instruments. Geisha in particular were required to learn to play the shamisen as a maiko, but would also typically learn to play the flute and various forms of drums. The types of dances they performed were often meant to tell a story, similar to a play, using various gestures to convey meaning. Some geisha could also be particularly skilled in calligraphy.  Two geisha playing a \u201ckoto\u201d (left) and \u201cshamisen\u201d (right). Beyond music and dance, the skills of a kisaeng would often depend on the region they resided in. For example, some regional kisaeng focused on performing pansori (a type of Korean opera), while others were famous for performing geommu (a traditional sword dance). Kisaeng over the age of thirty focused on needlework, dressmaking, and even learned to practice medicine to act as nurses when required. Another unique aspect of kisaeng is that they were usually educated to develop a quick wit and would often create riddles for their clients to solve. Also due to this, when kisaeng composed poetry, they tended to specialize in sijo form, which typically employed twist elements. Kisaeng, in fact were instrumental the the development and elevation of this poetry style.  Several 20th century kisaeng posing for a photo before performing a \u201cgeommu.\u201d Appearance: The appearance of both kisaeng and geisha was largely dictated by the fashion trends of the respective cultures. To compare the two would be like comparing the each nations fashion culture, but I guess I\u2019ll say something anyway.  A modern geiko (center) with two maiko, illustrating the significant difference in appearance between the two positions. Perhaps reflecting their origin, true geisha was fairly subdued in terms of their appearance. While the stereotypic image of a geisha was that of a woman in white oshiroi white makeup in an ornate, long sleeved kimono, this was actually the attire of maiko, not full fledged geiko. Geiko themselves would only don such an appearance except for particularly special performances. Instead, they more typically wore more visually conservative (though not low quality) kimono\u2019s. Notably, the collar of a maiko\u2019s kimono was always red (either solid or patterned) while a geiko\u2019s collar was always white. This was why the ceremony in which a maiko graduated to a geiko was called \u201cturning the collar.\u201d Furthermore, the sleeves a a maiko were always considerable longer than that of a geiko. When they did wear make up, geiko and maiko alike would typically blacken their teeth with charcoal, as was the fashion of the time.  Two maiko. Note the extra long sleeves that distinguish them as such and the red-white patterned under collar which suggests senior status as maiko. Kisaeng, by comparison, were considerably more ornate than a geiko in terms of clothing, though arguably less so than a maiko. A difference, however, is that there was no dress code to distinguish kisaeng of different ranks. They typically wore an ornate jeogori (upper jacket of a hanbok) with a brightly colored chima (hanbok skirt). Though often portrayed as wearing gache (a large and ornate wig), the headgear or a kisaeng largely depended on the region and the occasion. Depending on the occasion or type of performance, however, kisaeng would also wore wonsam, a large, ornate gown with long sleeves that typically went over the hanbok. Overall, kisaeng were remarkably similar in appearance to noble women in terms of dress.  A color corrected photograph of a kisaeng, likely taken during the late nineteenth or early 20th century. One of the few physical distinctions was that unlike women of nobility, kisaeng were not required for fully cover themselves with a jangot or sseugae chima when they went outside and instead instead wore a jeonmo (a large, fashionable sun hat). Unlike geisha and maiko, kisaeng did not seem to have any dress code to distinguish one rank from the other.  A painting depicting two kisaeng on an outing. Note the woman in the foreground as she is wearing a \u201cchima\u201d head covering, suggesting that she is a noble woman and thus distinguishing her from the kisaeng. Patronage and Relationships: Traditionally, geisha were required to refrain from romantic relationships if they wished to continue working. Though they were free to marry if they wished, they were usually forced to retire to do so. The closest relationship a geisha could have with a man while maintaining her profession was called a danna. A danna was a patron, typically wealthy, who would pay for the geisha\u2019s expenses, and provide her with gifts while allowing her to stay in his home. This patronage system, however, doesn\u2019t always equate to a romantic relationship, though they did often coincide. This system, however, was often necessary for a geisha to gain independence from her okiya. Kisaeng were somewhat similar in that they were not allowed to have personal romantic relationships. They were more restricted, however, as their status did not allow them to simply retire whenever they wished. Around the mid-Joseon era, however, kisaeng also started to benefit from a patron system. The patron, called a gibu, would provide a kisaeng with financial support and would also act as a guardian. Unlike a danna, however, a gibu did not have exclusive rights to a kisaengs services, nor could he have her stay in his home. If a man was wealthy enough, however, he could take a kisaeng as a concubine (a secondary wife) by paying a substantial fee. This was typically an ideal, albeit early, retirement for a kisaeng as it provided her with long term security. A kisaengs social status, however, was not improved though such an arrangement. Interestingly, though any child of a kisaeng would be considered illegitimate, a son could receive his fathers status (particularly if he was from the royal family) and could even be designated as his heir while daughters would always inherit their mothers status, typically becoming kisaeng themselves. Association with Sex: Considering the stereotypes of the two, I feel obligated to mention something on this. While it wouldn\u2019t be accurate to call either geisha or kisaeng prostitutes, there were some reasons why this stereotype developed for both. As I and probably others have pointed out numerous times, both kisaeng and geisha were first and foremost entertainers. Yet, sex for compensation was not entirely absent from the professions. While most geisha did not provide sexual services, there was a minority that did. At the time, prostitution was legal in Japan, within designated areas. But with the presence of yujo (average prostitutes) and oiran who already provided sexual services, there wasn\u2019t a significant need for geisha to do do the same. That said, however, there wasn\u2019t much to stop a geisha from providing such services if she wished to do so. Such cases were prominent enough to that different terms were used to distinguish geisha\u2019s who provided sex from those who didn\u2019t; kuruwa geisha would provide sex in addition to entertainment while machi geisha would provide only entertainment. And while the geisha did not necessarily have a romantic relationship with her danna, many did, often acting more like a secondary wife than a personal entertainer. Furthermore, in some cases, the ceremony in which a maiko was promoted to geiko status, the maiko would undergo mizuage; a process in which the maiko\u2019s virginity was given to a patron who had been sponsoring her. Mizuage, however, was not universally practiced as it seemed to be reserved to smaller, rural communities. The association with prostitution was exasperated during the US occupation period as many prostitutes claimed to be geisha, thus greatly distorting the international understanding of the profession. Kisaeng, however, were not legally allowed to provide sexual services to customers. Prostitution itself did not exist as a legal, organized profession prior to the 1870\u2019s due to Korea\u2019s strict adherence to Neo-Confucian ideals. To say that the law was followed to the letter, however, would be a lie. Some kisaeng did offer sex for compensation to some customers, but it was typically done only by those of samsu rank and likely in smaller, rural towns where there was considerably less oversight. There were, however, also instances where some customers would use their higher social class (typically the yangban aristocracy) to force kisaeng into providing sexual services. Gwangi kisaeng were particularly vulnerable to this as they were isolated from the kibangs and gyobang, which helped to provide some protection against this. The prevalence of either cases is not well known, most scholars on the subject agree that the majority of kisaeng did not (willingly) provide sexual services.  During the late Joseon-era, kisaeng were popularly depicted in paintings in romantic encounters. Stories of kisaeng romances were also popular, though both these things were largely responsible for their later association with prostitution. Today: Although true geisha briefly fell into obscurity by the 1940\u2019s and 50\u2019s, the effort of many in Japan to revive their traditional cultural traditions has has made it so a healthy number of geisha exist today. Many modern geisha do not necessarily have to start out as maiko or train in an ochiya if they have obtained the necessary skills beforehand, which affords them significantly more autonomy than their historical counterparts. And, just so it\u2019s said, modern geisha, do not provide sex for compensation as prostitution is now illegal in Japan. As a result of this, the danna system is rarely practiced today as it often seen on the darker side of the grey area.  Geisha still operate today and are a popular target for tourists visiting Japan. As for kisaeng, despite functioning even during the period of Japanese annexation, they have essentially vanished by this point. Though there are apparently some kibangs that operate in South Korea, they likely only borrow the name as the training, education, and services provided pale in comparison to their historical counterparts and thus are not considered real kisaeng. In fact, many traditional songs and dance of kisaeng have been lost forever due to decades of annexation, war and division of the county, all compounded by the lack of coverage they received in historiographies. Though there has been rising interest in the kisaeng in recent years, there has not been any real effort to revive the system as was done in Japan with their geisha. In North Korea, any surviving kisaeng and their descendants were labeled as a hostile class back in the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, thus it\u2019s highly unlikely that any exist there today.  Kisaeng generally no longer exist today. Now somewhat of a historical enigma, they have become a popular subject of modern media. ",

            "answer_text": "Others already wrote great answers. I learned from them a lot. Thank you for the good answers. What I only know is their nuance in modern society. 1. Geisha is felt like one of the traditional Japanese cultural things nowadays. I think it\u2019s because Japanese government retrieved many traditional things they didn\u2019t focus on in the past, and made it into one of Japanese cultural parts for foreigners. So, when we hear \u201cgeisha,\u201d we imagine a woman is performing it as an art with the traditional dress and makeup. 2. Gisaeng has the nuance of \u201csexual lady for a man in the bar\u201d in modern Korean. So, when we hear \u201cgisaeng,\u201d it sounds like a metaphor for women appealing their sexism for or assisting a man with liquor.  About gisaeng, I think it\u2019s because the concept of traditional gisaeng is no more in Korean society, and Koreans\u2019 general view for gisaeng changed for some reasons. Originally, as others said, gisaengs were women with high levels of poetry and literacy. They were maybe the most educated women back then except for queens. They assisted yangban \u2014 nobel men \u2014 with playing instrument, and some other activities for many parties. In other words, they were partly similar to musicians in the party hall in Europe in the past. However, the problem was those yangbans. Some of them were arrogant with their power as nobels, they forced gisaengs to assist them sometimes. It was written in some classic Korean novels. In this situation, they had no choice but to follow those yangbans. So, they semed to assist and appealing yangbans with their sexism. I think this is why the image of gisaeng changed negatively nowadays, like prostitute. But I think it\u2019s not fair, because it was not those gisaengs willings but the yangbans force. But the view for gisaeng changed as if it had been for voluntarily assisting men with sexism. So, in modern Korean, the word \u201cgisaeng\u201d is sometimes used for indicating women in the bar assisting men with appealing sexism. Korean government also didn\u2019t revive the concept of traditional gisaeng as a cultural part for foreigners. This may be from the changed image of it. ",
