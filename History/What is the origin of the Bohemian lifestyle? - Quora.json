            "answer_text": " The area enclosed in red defines Bohemia in the year 1400, and which today forms part of the Czech Republic. A bohemian lifestyle is usually characterized by a person or persons who live in an unconventional manner. In nineteenth century France, it was believed (wrongly) that the Romany people, aka Gypsies, Travelers, and perhaps lots of other names as well, originated in Bohemia. Furthermore, as the Romany people had a lifestyle not in sync with the general population, the label 'Bohemian' was a convenient description for individuals or groups not complying with what was considered to be the norm in society. A prime example would be a male artist who wore his hair long, while every other guy in the country was walking around looking as if he were part of the Marine Corps. To conclude, the term was coined in the mid to late nineteenth century, and would appear to have stayed the course ever since. ",
