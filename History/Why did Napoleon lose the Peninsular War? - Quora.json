            "answer_text": "Napoleon won many battles and wars including the initial war against Portugal and Spain. But unlike his victories over Austria, Prussia and Russia through 1809, he never sought to remove those monarchies and occupy his victims. That is what he did in the Iberian peninsula, and it sparked a war of liberation throughout the peninsula. It was a massive guerilla war and as difficult to win as modern guerilla wars. The British intervened and liberated Portugal, and then bedeviled the French in Spain. The British were led by Wellington, who led a brilliant effort with very limited troops. He also pioneered supply and logistics that were critical in the struggle. The French tended to win fighting guerillas, but could never end the rebellion. They lost consistently fighting Wellington. The French kept sending in forces which kept the war in check, but by 1812, that ended. Wellington invaded Spain and captured Madrid. ",

But looking at the \u2018peninsula\u2019 itself we can note that Napoleon never really bothered with it himself, but left things to several competing sub-commanders who could easily be outplayed one by one. Which is exactly what happened. ",
