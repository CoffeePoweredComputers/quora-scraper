            "answer_text": "The good majority considered themselves Christian and were considered Christian at the time. The one major exception was probably Thomas Paine, who leaned more toward agnostic. Thomas Jefferson was a Diest, and John Adams and Ben Franklin were Unitarians. 200+ years ago, you could be a Diest or Unitarian and still be considered Christian. Since then, some Christians have narrowed the standards. What people like Jefferson, Adams, and Franklin believed was 1) there was some kind of cosmic God, but not necessarily one who performed miracles, 2) the surpassing wisdom of Jesus\u2019 moral teachings, and 3) usually some possibility of an afterlife. But they did not accept the Trinity or Incarnation. Of the other Founding Fathers, they tended to belong to a \u201cmainline\u201d religious denomination but were generally not what we would call \u201cEvangelicals\u201d or \u201cFundamentalists\u201d today. For example, George Washington was an Anglican (today he\u2019d be Episcopalian), but questioned the literal truth of transubstantiation. He also believed strongly in religious freedom for all Americans. ",
