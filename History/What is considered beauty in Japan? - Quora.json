            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A! They love pale skin, big eyes with eyelids with fold, skinny body and small feet. For men, tall, big eyes with fold in eye lid or not, broad shoulder and slender legs, a little bit of muscles but not too much like Gold\u2019s Gym poster, and dress nicely. Women buy beauty products to bleach their skin and wear sunblock at all times and use a parasol to walk outside. Whiteness of the skin has been considered as purity (has nothing to do with Caucasian) since the old days. For men a slightly tanned is ok but only barely. Tanned skin is considered \u201cplayer\u201d or someone not serious and it is considered as a bad thing in the company. Men and women tend to put sunblock and wear long sleeve T-shirts so they don\u2019t get tanned while they are on vacation. They like cute or chic but they don\u2019t like sexy. Sexy is considered vulgar or reserved for women of the night (hostesses, high class companions, etc.). But Japanese fashion has its diversity and each type of fashion has its beauty. In Tokyo each city has its fashion types. In Harajuku we can see Goth, Lolita (girls who dress like dolls), koseiha (literally means original), and in Shibuya there are some gyaru (girls who tan and die their hair, blond, platinum or rainbow colors and they also tan and wear lots of make ups) etc The fashion depends on people\u2019s age as well. The younger they are the more diverse. People tend to stop being original as they age because of the intolerance of originality in the working environment. Dying your hair as a man isn\u2019t tolerated, women can only lighten their hair color but just dark brown etc. Dying your hair is also considered not \u201cclassy\u201d in the working environment. There\u2019s always the standard that\u2019s imposed to us from very young age in schools. While I was living there, people would ask me all the time \u201chow come you\u2019re so black?\u201d and they would mention it anytime they could. When I was in Japanese school, kids would mock me for my dark skin. These are the generalization but you can think that majority of \u201cnormal\u201d Japanese prefer light skin and \u201cclassy\u201d people. Here are some examples, I took some pictures from the \u201cbeautiful Japanese women list\u201d from a Japanese blog.          Source: https://the-rankers.com/posts/beautiful-japanese/ Here are the men\u2019s example:        These people are all in the show business so they are not the representation of the majority of Japanese people, but you can get some ideas about what they consider good looking.

            "answer_text": "Alright, the attractive things in Japan, not to mention the hot travel spot, hot spring, The way they do and don\u2019t, and the season festival special, I am going to talk about the \u201cMarket Street\u201d in Japan, where you can find tons of cafe, restaurant, convenient store, drug store, and so on and the most important, they open all year round. The market street appear like a shopping mall but the atmosphere is different, you can feel the energy and blend yourself into the Japan culture, try their common dishes, traditional food, and also special dining.  The photo above is the Tanuki(Raccoon) square in Hokkaido and it is located in the city of Sapporo. They are 7 streets in total, fill with various shop and diner, you can just find what you want on this street.  A welcoming doll in front of the bargain drug store.  Yup, do you see the tax free in the picture? They are a lot of tax-free shop around here if you buy a certain amount of their goods, then they will give you a receipt and clip in your passport then give you cash back straight, what you need to do is show the receipt to the custom during your flight. Other than shopping, you can find a lot of diners here, from the small roadside food vendor, izakaya, cafe, family restaurant, until luxury steak house, also a pub, bistro, bakery, and dessert house, all of them are gathering in this multi-purpose street. Not only traveler, this market street also drawing local to relax in this lovely bustling street.  This is another street in Otaru Hokkaido, it seems loneliness at daylight, for what I saw during my travel, these market streets are always bustling at night.  This is an underground street in Hokkaido, \u201cgluttony\u201d. You can tell from its name, this street is big and full with an array of food, snack, drinks, dessert, cake, ice cream, and so on, you can spend few days and have your breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner around here and yet, you can\u2019t finish trying everything here. I love the fried food here.  This is the Kuromon market in Osaka, very busy in the morning and it is a fresh food market. You can find the top quality of Japanese beef around here and also fresh seafood which you always encounter in the Japanese restaurant. some of the shops here provide food tasting (They grill Sirloin in front of you with Charcoal!!) , you may buy if you like the product, or you pick your favorite beef, then they grill for you on the spot, of course, some of the shops are without a seat.  This is another street in Osaka, you can find the best Kushi Age in Osaka around here. I really enjoy walking through a clean, lovely, and bustle street in Japan which accompany with relaxing music which broadcasted by the speakers around the street. You don\u2019t need to look for it when you comes to Japan, as it appears when you roam around in the city. I hope my writing is understandable and I hope this help. ",
