            "answer_text": "Communication.  Electricity helped win the US Civil War. The first important electrical application was the telegraph.   During the Civil War, the north had telegraph wires (mainly running along its rail-lines) and the south didn't. Lincoln had a telegraph room in which he would receive real-time updates and issue direct orders.   The south was still using couriers bearing letters. Lincoln spent hours - days - in that room.   He would wake up and go straight there. This ability to communicate in real-time proved critical to the northern victory. Soon the telegraphs were opened up for civilian use in the form of a \"telegram\" - mail that transmitted by telegraph and transcribed on the other end for local delivery. ",
