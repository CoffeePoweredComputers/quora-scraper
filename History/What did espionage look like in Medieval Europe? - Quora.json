            "answer_text": "There is a very good historic example how the 13th century James Bond would look like. The person in question was even an Englishman, but his real name is shrouded in mystery. He was known as Robert of London, but it\u2019s highly doubtful if this was his original name. Robert was a very educated English priest who spoke a lot of foreign languages. He was sent as a secret envoy to the court of Emir Mohammed-al-Nassir of Morocco by King John \u201cLackland\u201d. He was supposed to win the Emir\u2019s support to the king in some events which will later become the inspiration to Game of Thrones. Robert however wasn\u2019t an idiot, he understood that Muslim troops in England would mean the end of a Christian kingdom. He deliberately botched the mission, then returned to England and became one of the key persons behind the Magna Charta. In 1218 he was ostracized and ousted from England for his participation in the Magna Charta rebellion. He joined the Templars and became a Crusader. On his way to the Holy Land he visited Hungary where he spent some time and inspired the creation of a historical document very similar to the Magna Charta, the Golden Bullion (Aranybulla) in 1222. Thus Hungary avoided the fate of England and didn\u2019t slide into anarchy as much as England did. He also received military training in Hungary from his hosts, which mostly included strategy and tactics. In other words, he became a highly trained military commander. In the meantime he also learnt Hungarian and became familiar with the Hungarian state\u2019s workings. However Robert had a dark side too. He was an avid gambler. One day he lost everything he owned in the town of Akko, (today Acre in Israel, north of Haifa). The Templars then ousted him, shaved his head and chased him out of town in only a cloak. He was left to die in the desert, but his physical stance and intelligence saved him. He successfully found an envoy of the Mongol Empire and offered his services to Khan Batu. As a person speaking many Western languages and skilled in the arts of war, he was accepted into the Khan\u2019s service. 13 years later, in 1235 he was elected to become the chief diplomat and master spy of the empire. He was tasked to walk ahead of the Mongol armies on their campaign towards the West and \u201cput a golden saffle in the mouth of every nation\u201d. He was just about to turn European history once more. In these times the Hungarians did not only live in the Carpathian Basin. Groups of Hungarians remained in the Eastern steppes - today Russia - who settled there before the main host reached the Carpathians in the 9th century and founded today\u2019s Hungary. Robert met these Hungarians too. He was just enjoying their hospitality when he met another historic figure: Friar Julianus, the envoy of King B\u00e9la the IV from Hungary, who was travelling eastward to establish contact with the same Hungarian tribes. The two diplomats met and talked in 1236. Julianus was quite surprised that the Mongols had a European in their service, and that he even spoke fluent Hungarian. He mentioned this meeting in his report to the king when he returned. The head of the Dominican order, Bishop Ricardus was very concerned about the Mongols, he thoroughly questioned Julianus about this mysterious Englishman, and he has written a detailed report to the Pope. It is still in the Vatican\u2019s library. In the meantime the Mongols conquered the areas then known as Magna Hungaria and Magna Bulgaria, areas where scattered parts of the Hungarian and Bulgarian people lived (both remnants of the former Hun empire). These people have completely disappeared after the Mongol conquest. Robert had a major role in these conquests, his diplomatic skills greatly accelerated Batu\u2019s campaigns. The next target of the Mongols was Hungary, the first bastion of Catholic Europe. Robert, on behalf of the Khan, has written two letters to King B\u00e9la, offering him terms in exchange of letting the Mongol host pass Hungarian territory. In these letters he argued with the relationship between Hungarians and Mongols, both being steppe nations, with similar culture and past. B\u00e9la did not buy this and decided to resist. It wasn\u2019t a very good idea because the Mongols made short work of the Hungarian army in the battle of Muhi in 1241. Ironically they used the same tactics as the Hungarians in the 9th century to beat armored German knights, and the Hungarians now used the same knights themselves. The Mongols massacred the whole army. The king survived and escaped - he left the next year in the castle of Trau in Croatia, on an island - but the Mongols ravaged and pillaged the whole country. It was probably the worst disaster in our nation\u2019s history. However, the story doesn\u2019t end here. After the battle of Muhi, the Mongols were collecting valuables from the dead on the battlefield. They found the beheaded corpse of the chancellor of Hungary, and found the royal sigil on it. This gave an idea to someone who was able to recognize what it is, and also spoke Hungarian. Most likely it was Robert of London again. He personally picked some captured Catholic priests and offered them freedom instead of brutal execution in case they deliver a \u201croyal\u201d letter to all cities and villages. He used the stolen royal sigil and his Hungarian knowledge to produce a letter in the name of King B\u00e9la IV. Roughly translated, the contents were this: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of the rage and ferocity of the dogs, and don\u2019t dare to move out of your houses. Although due to some unforeseen circumstances we all had to leave the camp and our tents, with God\u2019s grace we are slowly getting them back and we are preparing to fight another battle; thus we ask you only to pray, may the graceful God squash our enemies\u2019 skulls.\u201d In other words, this letter called to cease all armed resistance. The text of this letter was preserved in a contemporary chronicle written by Bishop Rogerius. The results were devastating: most cities believed the deception, did not prepare for any defense, believing that a royal army is holding up the enemy somewhere, and quickly fell to the Mongols. (As a side note, there is a widely used literary term in Hungarian for Mongols: \u201cdog-headed Tartars\u201d. The idea of calling them \u201cdog-headed comes from this \u201croyal\u201d letter, which compared them to wild dogs.) Robert\u2019s luck ran out in 1242. He was captured near Wiener Neustadt with a group of Mongol officers on a spy mission. He was identified, sentenced to death for treachery against Christianity and executed. So this is how a spy worked in the Middle Ages. Robert\u2019s story is certainly extraordinary though. ",

            "answer_text": "After the collapse of the Roman Empire in Europe, espionage and intelligence activities were confined to wartime or local service. Warring factions under barbarian lords may have used strategic espionage to gauge the strength of their opposition or learn about enemy defenses, but no written records of such activities survive. The only considerable political force in Europe during the Dark Ages was the Catholic Church, but operations on the European periphery were confined to monastic outposts that struggled for survival. In the Middle Ages, the birth of large nation-states, such as France and England, in the ninth and tenth centuries facilitated the need for intelligence in a diplomatic setting. Systems of couriers, translators, and royal messengers carried diplomatic messages between monarchs or feudal lords. Literacy was a rarity, even in the early royal courts, so messages were carefully delivered verbatim by couriers, or clergy acted as scribes. Espionage remained mostly limited to battlefield operations, but the development of the feudal system, in which lords swore fealty to monarchs, created a complicated allegiance network. The web of allegiances gave rise to laws prohibiting treason, double allegiances, and political espionage against allied lords. In the eleventh century, the Catholic Church rose to the fore in European politics. With a large bureaucratic network, the resources of feudal military forces, and the largest treasury in the world, the Church formed policy that governed all of Europe. Throughout the course of the Middle Ages, two events, the Crusades and the Inquisition, solidified the power of the Church and created the only long-standing, medieval intelligence community. In 1095, Pope Urban II called for the first Crusade, a military campaign to recapture Jerusalem and the Holy Lands from Muslim and Byzantine rule. The Church massed several large armies, and employed spies to report on defenses surrounding Constantinople and Jerusalem. Special intelligence agents also infiltrated prisons to free captured crusaders, or sabotage rival palaces, mosques, and military defenses. The Crusades continued for nearly four centuries, draining the military and intelligence resources of most of the European monarchs. The Crusades also changed the tenor of espionage and intelligence work within Europe itself. Religious fervor, and the desire for political consolidation, prompted thirteenth century church councils to establish laws regarding the prosecution of heretics and anti-clerical political leaders. The ensuing movement became known as the Inquisition. Although the Church used its political force as impetus for the Inquisition, enforcement of religious edicts and prosecution of violators fell to local clergy and secular authorities. For this reason, the Inquisition took many forms throughout Europe. The same movement that was terror-filled and brutal in Spain, had little impact in England and Scandinavia. Espionage was an essential component of the Inquisition. The Church relied on vast networks of informants to find and denounce suspected heretics and political dissidents. By the early fourteenth century, Rome and the Spanish monarchs both employed sizable secret police forces to carry out mass trials and public executions. In southern France, heretical groups relied on intelligence gathered from their own resistance networks to gauge the surrounding political climate, and assist in hiding refugees. In 1542, the process of Inquisition was centralized within the Church. Pope Paul III established the Congregation of the Holy Office, a permanent council, composed of cardinals and other officials, whose mission was to maintain the political integrity of Church. The council relied on censure and excommunication to coerce problematic individuals, forsaking the brutal cloak and dagger methods of early Inquisitors. The council maintained spies and informants, but shifted their focus to scrutinizing the actions of Europe's monarchs and prominent aristocrats. The advent of the Renaissance in Italy in the mid-fifteenth century quelled much of the fervor and political fear that drove the Inquisition, and the movement faded.
