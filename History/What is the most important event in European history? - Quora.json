            "answer_text": "For me, the most important event in Europe\u2019s history was The Black Death.  What makes this so important is that it was Europe\u2019s reset button. Before the Black Death, the people in Europe were living either in densely crowded cities reeking with dysentery\u2026  \u2026or were toiling as serfs on the countryside, aggressively working to feed an overpopulated continent.  All ruled by an outdated feudal system and an increasingly corrupt Catholic Church that controlled all aspects of life.  When the flea carrying rats had carried the disease, it spread like wildfire across the world, but especially in overpopulated Europe.  From 1347 - 1351, as an entire third of Europe\u2019s population had perished, everyone thought it was the coming of the apocalypse. Populations in cities were cut in half, and those who died were buried in mass graves.  The Jewish population of Europe were forced to move further East after being blamed for bringing the Black Death, as many of them did not catch it.  Entire monasteries died from this disease.  But out of this tragedy, came a new Europe. Due to the labor shortage, landowners were forced to increase the wages and conditions of their peasants, or risk them leaving their estate.  With higher wages, the peasants could buy what they wanted such as consumer goods, from beer to clothing to furniture in a newly growing market.  With fewer people to feed, famines such as the Great Famine of 1315\u201317 would no longer happen. An increase in investment saw a universal increase in wealth across Europe.  So when the Lords tried to reestablish pre-Black Death wages and conditions, the peasants revolted, and a new and growing middle class was cemented.  Those who survived the disease would build up a resistance to the disease, and even though there were major outbreaks later on such as in London or Florence, it would never reach the levels that the Black Death did. As the Church could do nothing to stop the Black Death - the veteran clergymen had all suffered at the hands of the disease, and were soon replaced by novices - people began losing faith in the Catholic Church, paving the way for the Scientific Revolution, and Protestant Reformations later on.   So while the Black Death had brought destruction to Europe, like a phoenix, it rose from the ashes, improved and stronger for centuries to come.

            "answer_text": "The Battle of Tours In the beginning of the 8th century, the Umayyad Caliphate was reaching the height of its power. The Caliphate had engaged in continuous conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the East. By 715 AD they had conquered the Iberian peninsula and were making their way into the European heartland.  The Umayyad forces were making their way north Prior to fighting the Frankish army led by Charles Martel, the Umayyad Caliphate found the European kingdoms to be easy prey. They were decentralized and preoccupied with fighting among their own to combat the invading force. The Umayyad army invaded the Frankish kingdom after they conquered the Iberian peninsula. Charles Martel knew of the growing threat from the Arab army and decided to make an alliance with the neighboring Frankish kingdoms. The Arab army, led by Ar Rahman, set their sites on the city of Tours. Charles Martel knew of this and sent his army to meet them there. In the battle, the Ar Rahman led heavy cavalry charges in attempts to break through the Frankish line only to be repeatedly rebuffed attempt after attempt. Then part of the Frankish army led by Odo counterattacked with their cavalry by flanking the Arab army and attacking their camp. This resulted in large portions of the Arab army retreating back to defend the camp and this allowed for Martel\u2019s forces to advance and decimate the remaining Umayyad forces. Ar Rahman was killed in this battle.  Charles Martel depicted at the Battle of Tours The Frankish victory ended the Umayyad conquest of Europe. In addition Charles Martel gained fame for his victory and later played a vital role in establishing the Carolingian Dynasty. Had Charles Martel lost the Battle of Tours, it would have been very likely that the Umayyads would conquer the rest of Europe and establish Islam as the dominant religion in the region. This would have forever changed the European landscape and the many principles and events that formed the basis of Western Civilization. Instead Europe remained a Christian empire. ",
