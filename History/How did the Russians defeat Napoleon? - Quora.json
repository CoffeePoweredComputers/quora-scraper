            "answer_text": "It should be noted that the Russians never actually defeated Napoleon\u2019s army. Conventional wisdom on the Russian invasion is as has been said already that the Russians retreated back into Russia, drawing the huge French army after them and applying a scorched earth policy. This denied the French army much of the supplies that it needed so that eventually they became too weak and were forced to retreat. The snow and poor conditions caused a horrific amount of attrition and the some 600,000 men that contributed to the Russian campaign were wittled down to about 100,000. These figures can be a bit misleading however! Of the 600,000 some 200,000 were designated for garrison duty and supply administration and so were never destined to be engaging the enemy. Of the 400,000 about half were French compared to the Grande Armee of 1807, which invaded Russian the first time, of all whom were French. This multi-ethnic force consisted of many of Napoleon\u2019s client states who were generally second rate troops and Prussians and Austrians who were less then enthusiastic with French control. Therefore the numbers hide a weakness - the poorer quality and disloyal nature of some of the elements of the Grande Armee of 1812. The casualty figures seem crazy high but the vast majority were from desertions. Napoleon had been demanded ever increasing amount of conscripts from both France and his allies to fight in Spain and now to undertake the Russian invasion. Not many, including the French, were very keen on this and took their first opportunity to desert. Much of the \u201ccasualties\u201d were actually in the first half of the campaign and before General Winter kicked in. Many of Napoleon\u2019s issues can be laid at him changing his own plans and failing to understand the mindset of the Russians. Originally he had set out to destroy the Russian army completely with a look to occupying Lithuania, operating out of Vilna and setting down for winter if he had not done so. Instead he pushed on trying to catch the Russian army as best he could which was his original objective. He believed that putting pressure on Moscow would force the Russians to fight and he was right. The battle of Borodino was a French victory but not a conclusive one. A lot of the French horses had died from the campaigning being unable to bear the Russian heat. This deprived Napoleon of his cavalry to pursue and destroy the retreating Russians at Borodino and so instead he left them and occupied Moscow. At this point he had completely disregarded his plan and believed that the Russians would now negotiate for peace. Instead the Russians refused to negotiate and so Napoleon was overstretched and in a poor position. His ego stopped him from making the decision to retreat for a few days in which time Moscow was set on fire. It should be noted that at this point Napoleon had around 140,000 men left at his disposal - most of the damage had already been done by desertion and death, but as said earlier there was also a great deal of men detached along the supply lines. Even during the retreat from Moscow the Russians were cautious to attack as they believed that the French could still fight back. This can be seen at the battle of Maloyaroslavet where the French defeated a Russian force. The impressive crossing of the Berezina also showed that the French were still capable of great feats. The French force that recrossed the Vistula river into Poland was a shell of its former self no doubt and the losses were huge. The same however can also be said for the Russians - they needed time to mount an invasion as their troops were also ravaged by cold and poor supplies. The defection of the Prussians and the disengagement of the Austrians were the bigger blows for Napoleon immediately after. He would go on to show that he could still muster large armies to fight but the introduction of the Prussians and then Austrians to the fight against him would massively swing the balance of power. Without these defections it is unlikely that the Russians would have been able to support an invasion, and if they had they would most likely have been checked by Napoleon. So while the Russians were certainly influential in Napoleon\u2019s defeat no doubt it was the desertion of his \u201callies\u201d that truly saw him finished and even then there were moments where it looked like Napoleon might have been able to pull it off.

            "answer_text": "Since the beginning, the operation was destined to fail, not just because of a powerful Russian army but with things related to logistics and supplies and Napoleon\u2019s decisions. There are three main reasons why he lost. 1- This army was too far away to be properly supplied. Even now when we have trains and trucks it would be a big strain on the supply system. Imagine in 1812 when the only way supplying armies was through carriages or goods from captured cities. Keep in mind that the army consisted of 680,000 soldiers with over a 1,000 guns, this was extremely large for the time it happened. These supply problems are reflected by the number of soldiers that died because of disease and starvation. Notice how far away is Moscow.   Look at how many people died from diseases in August. 2- Napoleon stayed much longer in Russia than expected. By the 15th of September Napoleon had already captured Moscow and he fought that the Russian Tzar is going to sign a peace treaty. But this would not happen, Moscow wasn\u2019t the Russian capital and their army was still undefeated and capable of fighting. This seems quite strange, as Napoleon captured Vienna (the Austrian capital) 2 times, on both occasions the Austrians didn\u2019t surrender as their army was still standing, and he had to go and defeated them. Why would he think that the Russians would surrender now? Owing to his false ideas his army stayed in Moscow until the 18th of October. The snowy and Winter weather started exceptionally early this year and Napoleon\u2019s troops lacked winter clothing. When Napoleon decided to retreat his march was slower because of the heavy snow there was. If he left Russia earlier most of this wouldn\u2019t happen. 3- Russian strategy and forces. People often think that the Russian army was deeply outnumbered by the Grand Arme\u00e9, but this is far from true. The Russians counted upon almost 500,000 regular troops and almost 1,400 guns, this is more than Napoleon\u2019s artillery forces. There were also hundreds of thousands of militia and partisans during the campaign. Nevertheless, the Russian regular army was spread out, with some forces in the South to defend a possible Turkish offensive. Russian commanders were well aware of the greater experience of Napoleon\u2019s commanders and soldiers, and they knew that Napoleon\u2019s aim was to destroy the Russain army and not to capture cities. Owing to this and their past experiences with Napoleon, Russian superior commander, Barclay de Tolly decided to use the vastness of Russia to his advantage, he also decided to use scorched-earth tactics to prevent the French from capturing any resources. The Russian nobles thought that this strategy was for cowards and they were afraid that Barclay de Tolly (he wasn\u2019t Russian) would betray them. Because of this, they replaced him with Mikhail Kutuzov. Kutuzov knew that Barclay de Tolly was right and he continued his strategy. Napoleon was able to reach the Russain army at Borodino, and he fought he could destroy the Russian army. However, by this time Napoleon\u2019s and Russain forces were almost equal in numbers. As big parts of his army went to his flanks and to the Baltic countries. Moreover, he found the Russians in well-prepared defensive positions. Napoleon also became ill of a disease (most likely hemorrhoids) that prevented him from riding a horse. The Russians managed to inflict heavy casualties on the French and retreat. After capturing Moscow and staying there for 5 weeks Napoleon had to retreat. At that moment the Russain cavalry harassed French forces. Because of this Napoleon had sacrifice a few thousand troops to save the rest of them. To sum up, the key reasons why Napololeon failed were related to his own decisions and logistics problems. ",

            "answer_text": "The Russians never militarily defeated Napoleon on the battlefield. They just kept retreating, avoiding battle until reaching Moscow, lost this battle, continued to retreat further to the East then just sat there and waited for the winter to show. What defeated Napoleon in Russia was the early and harsh winter this year, and overextended lines of communications. Most of the casualties suffered by the Napoleonic army in Russia was during the retreat and because of cold or starvation, not because of combat losses. The Russians only sent cosaks to chase the poor living deads walking in the CD but their regular army was never able to push through the French rear guard commanded by Marshal Ney although this rear guard was really in low numbers and composed of exhausted men. Same at the Berezina the Russian regular army was unable to stop an exhausted Napoleonic army and the remaining s if the army (mainly composed of non-fighting men) went through it and finally made it back to France. Like during WWII the Russians can thanks the desertic immensity of Russia and the fact they had plenty of room to continue their retreat towards the East. Otherwise they would have been forced to sustain a decisive battle much earlier and no doubt that Napoleon would have crushed them like in Austerlitz, Eylau and Friedland because Russia was the first and only campaign of the Napoleonic wars where Napoleon had an army that outnumbered the army of his opponents.

            "answer_text": " The Russians drew Napoleon into the vastness of Russia, all the way to Moscow, did not leave anything of value for Napoleon\u2019s army to eat or use, and put up a tremendous fight at Borodino. Many French and allied soldiers were killed, and a death sentence was also passed on Napoleon\u2019s wounded, since they could not be taken out of Russia. The Russians refused to negotiate. When Napoleon finally decided to retreat, the Russians forced his army to leave the same barren way they had entered. Cossacks constantly attacked the retreating French soldiers, who starved and froze and died on the way back to their homes in Europe. When the French were crossing the last river, the Russians shelled their makeshift bridge and forced many into the freezing winter water. Less than 10% of the invading French army survived, and the dead included many of Napoleon\u2019s best and most experienced troops. While Napoleon was able to raise another army, it never fought as well as before, was less experienced and was outnumbered by the many enemies Napoleon had made. Napoleon\u2019s enemies rejoiced to know he had finally been beaten so thoroughly in Russia and this sealed Napoleon\u2019s fate. Nations started deserting the French alliance. Russia\u2019s army then invaded the French Empire, along with other allies of Russia and Britain. ",
