            "answer_text": "I asked a similar question some time ago and received a volley of similarly disappointing answers. In the meantime, I did some more research and I'm now in the position of answering this. But first, let us take a minute to ponder over how likening immigration to colonization, or freaking barbarian invasions is a very pedantic way of spitting in the face of every immigrant ever. We don't come to plunder your riches and rape your women, despite what your neofascist press likes to claim. On to my first example: Serbia Kosovo actually. Kosovo used to be a purely Serbian region, that is of key importance to Serbian history. But following lots of Albanian immigration, the population of Kosovo has now a strong Albanian majority. They felt alienated enough by the Serbian government to request some autonomy, to which Serbia replied with artillery shells. One civil war later, Kosovo is an ind\u00e9pendant stage and, as far as the Serbians are concerned, it was ripped out of Serbia because of immigration. Ever noticed how Singapore is at the end of what's called the \u201cMalaysian Peninsula\u201d? That's because Singapore used to be part of Malaysia. Given the extremely strategic location of it, you'd assume that this tiny nation ripped it's independence at the cost of a lot of blood. What happened instead is that there were so many Chinese immigrants in Singapore that, once they outnumbered the locals, the Malaysian government decided it was not theirs anymore and declared it ind\u00e9pendant. Like, Singapore woke up its own country one morning. Best ind\u00e9pendance ever. This incredibly stupid move on the part of Malaysia is explained by the fact that Malaysia is a notoriously racist country (as in appartheid). One of the many occurrences of racist = stupid. There. Those two tiny examples are all I could find on the topics of countries \u201ctaken over\u201d by immigration. Instead of entire countries, in both cases, it is just the secession of a tiny region. I'd love to hear about more examples. I would hate to hear about yet another military conquest being relabelled \u201cimmigration\u201d. ",

More recently, in Taiwan after Mao won, the losing Chinese settled there, displacing the ethnic Taiwanese. Israel is another example of immigrants totally displacing the local populations. Although Tibet is not officially a country, mass migration by the Chinese is done to explicitly dilute any resistance from the tibetans. Most Caribbean islands have been overrun by either westerners or the slaves they brought over. Hawaii, although not a country, has been overrun by Americans, though technically not immigrants either.
