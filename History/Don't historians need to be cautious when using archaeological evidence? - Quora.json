            "answer_text": "Every historian and archaeologist needs to be careful when analyzing any artifact or document left by a person or civilization. While archaeologists usually deal with physical artifacts, such as flint tools or burials or anything else left by people, historians usually deal with a mix of information that could include archaeological finds or, possibly, more often documents about a past event. Each source needs to be evaluated to determine if it is a primary source or a secondary source, or even if it has been faked. Take Titus Livy, who lived about 64\u201359 BCE to 12\u201317 CE. He wrote a history on the Second Punic War, which happened in 218 to 201 BCE long before Livy was alive. Livy\u2019s writing, therefore, is a secondary source since he was not a witness. An historian would need to be careful they treat Livy as a secondary source and not an eyewitness. The same caution is required when writing about one or more archaeological finds. Plus, dating a find can be challenging so you\u2019re not talking about absolute years. You could be talking about huge ranges of time. Homo erectus (\u201cupright man\u201d) finds, for example, show they evolved as a distinct species in Africa about 1.9 million years ago. That\u2019s a guess time period because science cannot be more precise with current technology. Several things about this information: The time frame is an estimate.Soon after Homo erectus is identified as a distinct species it appears they also migrated out of Africa.New finds could push the time frame for becoming a distinct species back further.It is not an absolute and should be treated as such.So, yes, every historian and archaeologist need to treat any source with caution and be prepared for new information.  Q: Don't historians need to be cautious when using archaeologist evidence? ",

            "answer_text": "Very cautious. Perhaps the greatest trap historians fall into with regard to archaeological evidence is the idea that, if there is none, than the historical event probably didn\u2019t happen. The truth is, archaeology only uncovers a fraction of a fraction of the things that once existed, we must keep this in mind when considering what is has to tell us. Above all, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. ",
