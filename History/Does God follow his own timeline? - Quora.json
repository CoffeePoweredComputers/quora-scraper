            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cDoes God follow a timeline?\u201d \u2026I will go against the consensus and say \u2026\u201cyes!\u201d What needs to be clarified is the word \u201cfollow.\u201d When I create a painting, there are specific steps existing within a process which all lead towards completion. First I build a frame, buy a canvas that fits, stretch my canvas on the frame, prime my canvas, sketch out my image, paint in sections in layered order, make my final touches, and \u201cvoil\u00e0!\u201d \u2026a completed work of art! I cannot make my final touches while I\u2019m building the frame nor can I sketch out my painting without first procuring a canvas. So with regard to creating my work of art, a definite timeline needs to be followed in order to reach completion. We see within all of God\u2019s creations that a timeline is being followed. In The Biblical Genesis there is a definitive seven-step timeline (days) that God uses in the creation of our universe (including a well-deserved off day from work).  Credits: \u201cSeven Days\u201d Yoram Raanan Jewish Biblical art Proponents of Intelligent Design can equally argue that God followed a 14 billion year timeline in the same way Quantum Theory has proposed with complex life forms arriving at a later point in time after the \u201cframe\u201d had been constructed and the \u201ccanvas had been primed.\u201d Another argument is that the arrival of Jesus Christ was the result of a specific timeline set in place by God based on the evolutionary development of society. The argument is that Christ\u2019s arrival during His time was based on the specific level of societal advancement our species had achieved. Christ arriving now, or 5000 years earlier might not have achieved the same results. We also find timelines embedded in everything that we are and all that we know exists. Even though we are considered masters of our own selves, our bodies are still governed by timelines. We are born, reach childhood, become an adult, grow old \u2026and then we die. Summary: Is God required to follow timelines? \u2026No. Does God follow timelines? \u2026Yes. True, God clearly uses timelines within His creation processes, but God is not subject to any timelines regarding Himself. An omnipotent entity that has an infinite origin and an infinite existence is not subject to any timelines. God could have created our universe 100 trillion years earlier or 1,000,000 trillion years later if so desired. However, this does not automatically assume that God does not follow specific creational timelines embedded within His infinite existence after creating our universe. ",

Because I was young I honestly dont understand the result. 5 years ago after he died about year 80 to 90ties I saw the proof. It is called unisex trend fashion. Another crucial event that was prophesied and told to me by my father when he was alive. He said, maybe passed your time all the jews on earth will form an alliance and will bond together, black jews, white jews, all kinds of jews. Dont believe anything I say, just follow the trend happening on earth, open up your eyes to reality, and do your own research. There will be shortage of food supplies and famine will be everywhere, earth will suffer from different calamities, flood, earthquake, volcanoes, heatwave, change in climate pattern. This is my god it gives you an early advance warning. Does your god give you this information? If not, be resourceful ask yourself why? ",

His creation is the intricate system of nature, with fixed and predictable laws, one of them being cause and effect. We choose whether or not to be in alignment with nature or not. There is no time line for God, only the thought of creation. Time is a construct that we use to organize our lives. However, the only time that exists is this very moment.
