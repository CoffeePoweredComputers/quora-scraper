            "answer_text": "Oh boy, here we go. Chevy is one of my favorite car companies but they had some real screw ups. 1: the Chevrolet Vega. When I hear someone saying that they have this car, I always think, \u201chow much of it is left?\u201d these cars ate the definition of rust. My 20 year old truck has less rust on it now than one of these things have in 6 months. Also let me tell you that my truck was soaking in moisture before I bought it. It's got lots of frame rust. 2: Chevrolet Chevette. Ahh yess, the underpowered rust bucket hatchback. I've never owned one, but for a good reason that I stated in the first sentence. It has the same problems as the Vega. It's an underpowered rust bucket that shouldn't have been made but GM wanted an economy car and they wanted one NOW. So these PoS\u2019s were made. I know some people loved these things but I doubt any of these cars are road worthy. 3: pretty much any Silverado from 99 to the present. I like the siverados. I own one. But Chevrolet trucks have a serious rust problem. Honestly I would ditch Chevrolet and buy an import because the Japanese really know how to build cars. But, whatever Chevy has done to prevent rust really doesn't work. The frame of my truck is made of \u201cgalvanized steel\u201d. Also it had a \u201cprotective coating.\u201d My friend has an 89 Ford F-150 and that thing has no rust. Of course do wash our trucks regularly and give our trucks basic needs but GM really needs to step back into thier roots and re find out how to make something reliable. ",
