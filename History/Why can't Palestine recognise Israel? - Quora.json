            "answer_text": "Mutual recognition as States has existed since the start of either state that is the Zionists have recognised Palestine as a State since the The Twelfth Zionist Congress was held in Carlsbad, Czechoslovakia in December 1921 - See more at: Page on mondoweiss.net from which it seceded in 1948 and conversely Palestine  has recognised Israel since 1948 The Statehood of Palestine. The Issue is all about the  borders of either state and not the recognition of either state, despite the political rhetoric. Paragraphs 6 of the 1921 Carlsbad Resolution state:  2. (a) The Jews on the one hand and the Arabs on the other are to be regarded as living side by side on a footing of perfect equality in all matters, including the official use and recognition of their respective languages.(b) In areas in which there is a mixed population, the rights of the minority are to be fully guaranteed, including the right of representation on the local administrative bodies.(c) The existence in Palestine of the Jewish National Home is not to be a bar to the recognition of Palestine, when the time is ripe, as a self-governing commonwealth. 3. The Zionist leaders and the Jews of Palestine will support the demand for the development of self-governing institutions on a representative basis, it being clearly understood that the terms of this agreement will remain binding and inviolable, as will also the provisions of the Mandate, so long as the Mandate is in force. 4. The Zionist leaders and the Jews of Palestine will support the demand that non-Palestinian officials, with the exception of the High Commissioner, the Civil, Financial and Legal Secretaries, and the heads of the Principal Departments, shall be gradually replaced by Palestinians, due regard being had, in the case of District officials, to the Arab or Jewish character, as the case may be, of the population concerned. 5. Jewish immigration is to be limited by the capacity of Palestine, from time to time, to absorb it, but not otherwise. It is declared that there is not nor has there ever been any intention to disturb the existing Arab population or any part of it. The right of the Arab inhabitants and their descendants to the secure enjoyment of their homes and prosperity is unequivocally recognised and guaranteed. 6. (a) It is agreed that the Law of Nationality should recognize as citizens of Palestine all persons who being presently resident in the country at a date to be subsequently fixed, do not decline such citizenship, provided that no person owing allegiance to another state shall become a citizen until he has renounced such allegiance.(b) It is further agreed that facilities should be provided for the acquisition of citizenship by persons who take up their permanent residence in Palestine, the qualifying period to be settled by common agreement with the Mandatory Power. (emphasis added)  In John Quigley's  book on  The Statehood of Palestine he quotes a letter from the Arab Higher Committee which confirms Israel's Statehood as at 1948:  \"The Arab Higher Committee and the Arab League states were confidentof their legal position that Palestine, coming out of the mandate,was a state that should become independent under a government thatwould control Palestine in its entirety. On December 17, 1948, Syria suggested in the Security Council that the admission of Israel to the UnitedNations might violate international law. In that regard, Syria raised thequestion of the status of Palestine. It asked the Security Council to seekfrom the International Court of Justice an advisory opinion on the followingquestions: 3. Under the present circumstances would the Security Council be actingin conformity with the United Nations Charter and the internationallaw if it recommended the admission of the State of Israel tomembership in the United Nations?4. Is the General Assembly empowered to partition Palestine betweenArabs and Jews without consulting the lawful inhabitants of thecountry in securing their consent?\"  (emphasis added) Quigley further adds:  In 1993, despite Israel\u2019s public position that it would not talk with thePLO, confidential PLO-Israel discussions took place in Oslo, Norway.The PLO did not insist on cessation of settlement construction as a precondition.The Norway discussions focused on setting up a temporaryPalestinian administration in Gaza and the West Bank, to lead after aperiod of time to negotiations for a final settlement between the twoparties. As secrecy on these talks was lifted, Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Rabin publicly recognized the PLO \u201cas the representative of thePalestinian people.\u201d4  Rabin demanded that the PLO recognize Israel, andin response Arafat wrote him a letter, stating that \u201c[t]he PLO recognizesthe right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security.\u201d (emphasis added) I might add that Israel also recognised Palestine as a State where Quigley quotes Benjamin Netanyahu:  Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud party, understoodthat Israel had done precisely that. Addressing Rabin from the floor ofthe Knesset, Netanyahu declared:Despite its denials, the government has accepted the creation of aPalestinian state. Israeli Courts have also accepted Palestine as a state again I quote from Quigley:  That Palestine statehood continued was implicitly affirmed by anIsraeli court in 1951 when an Israeli judge had to consider the questionof whether a person who had held Palestine citizenship during themandate and who, as of 1951, resided in Israel, was a citizen of Israel.Israel to that date had adopted no statute on citizenship; hence, it had nocitizenship. The judge answered the question in the affirmative based ongeneral legal concepts of state succession.[I]n the case of transfer of a portion of the territory of a State to anotherState, every inhabitant of the ceding State becomes automatically a nationalof the receiving State . . . . If that is the case, is it possible to say that theinhabitants of part of a State which is transformed into an independentState are not ipso facto transformed into the nationals of that State?79 The judge\u2019s reference to \u201cpart of a State\u201d was to Israel as a part ofPalestine. The judge was assuming Palestine to be a state, out of which a new state had been formed in part of its territory. (emphasis added) ",

            "answer_text": "Why be negative? Israel HAS recognized the Palestinian state and the Palestinians\u2019 right for a state of their own. Numerous times, as I will elaborate: The British, who ruled in the middle east since 1918, could not bear the continuous fight with both the Jewish and the Palestinian population. So in 1937 they suggested 2 states to be set: the Jews accepted the offer, the Palestinians REJECTED it (they could not accept the idea of a Jewish state). As fighting grew after WW2 they turned to the newly-born UN for help. They hoped the UN would approve them to stay and control the area, but the UN (November 29, 1947) voted for the establishment of 2 states: one Palestinian, one Jewish. And exactly so - the British had to leave the area (on May 14, 1948), and on that same day the Jewish state of Israel was declared. But no Palestinian state was declared, even though they had all of the possibilities, abilities and recognition. The entire planet waited for them to set up their own state. They did not need Israel\u2019s recognition. But they did not. They did not do this because they did not accept Israel exist at all- so they joined 7 Arab armies (Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon etc.), whose armies invaded the country, to try and physically annihilate each and every Jew. They thought that when Israel is wiped out - they would establish their state INSTEAD. But they failed, and the stupid Israelis did not want to die. That war ended in 1949 in a state where the Gaza strip AND the West Bank of the Jordan river being part of Arab countries (Egypt and Jordan, respectively). Strange - but no Palestinian state was declared on those territories. No one thought such a state should be - they ALL anticipated the coming destruction of Israel. Going forward to the 1990s - Israel and the Palestinian Authority negotiated to find a solution. Israel stated its acceptance of a Palestinian state. These talks eventually failed because of an unbelievable eruption of murder actions initiated by the Palestinians. In 2001 Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel proposed a very generous offer to the Palestinians in return for mutual recognition and end of conflict - rejected again. So you see - it\u2019s not about Israel recognizing a Palestinian state. It\u2019s the need for a change in the state of mind among Palestinians: accept Israel, negotiate and have mutual compromises made, once and for all. Amen! ",
