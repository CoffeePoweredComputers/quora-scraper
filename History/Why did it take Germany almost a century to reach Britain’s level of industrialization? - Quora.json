            "answer_text": "The simple answer is because Germany didn\u2019t exist. The area that now is Germany was a patchwork of principalities, free cities and small kingdoms of shifting feudal dynasties comprising the Holy Roman Empire for a Millennium until Napoleon, with French bureaucratic zeal, rationalised it down to about 320 individual territories. Parts of it were relatively advanced industrially like the Ruhr valley and Silesia. The Hapsburg House of Austria had become hereditary Emperors since the 15th Century and hosted the Peace Conference after Napoleon was defeated in 1815 in Vienna. Britain had played a major role in defeating Napoleon as had Prussia, an agrarian Kingdom in what is now Eastern Poland, with its capital in Konigsberg, now Kaliningrad the Russian fleet\u2019s Baltic enclave. So as part of the settlement Prussia received the Ruhr, probably partly as a British ploy to counterbalance the Catholic Hapsburgs with a Protestant power. Little did they realise that the Prussians would harness this industrial power to weld a rival German Empire that would not only challenge Austria and help keep France in check but also compete with Britain. By the 1830s the German states had begun this process with a Customs Union, so industrial development also required the German States to sweep away their Princely bureaucracies and associated feudal baggage in the way Britain had done two hundred years earlier. Industrialisation and social change together with the forging of a nation state all had to happen together\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "An interesting question. What we now call Germany was built by Bismarck from a heterogenous collection of states and countries, some of which were equally as advanced as UK pre 1800. For example, mines in what is now the Czech Republic were at least as developed as British mines in the nearly 18th century, complete with wooden railways along which the miners propelled smallish trucks. Nor was Germany behind in steam locomotives, of which the first good one was probably Der Adler (The Eagle) on the Nurnberg Railway as early as Stephenson\u2019s Rocket. Siegfried Markus in Vienna built a petrol driven self moving light wagon as early as the French motorcar pioneers. So, why did Germany not quite match Britain industrial development. Their army which defeated the French in 1870, while modern, was not especionally advanced as regards materiel, however excellent it was at fighting. But by 1914 Imperial Germany could field huge cannon which tore apart the defences of Liege, and as quickly as the British they had produced ultra-narrow gauge railways to get supplies up to the front. It\u2019s a bit of a puzzle. By 1914 Germany could produce battleships which could meet the British fleet as equals, but only in about half the quantity. Note: Just saying they were not as advanced is a simple get out. ",
