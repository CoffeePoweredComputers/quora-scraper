            "answer_text": "There is a single trait that I can think of.  Yes, just one. Coming from someone that has a high IQ and has been surrounded by many people with high IQs in his life. (Father, friends, teachers, therapists, etc.) This isn't even a habit. It's a trait. This trait is the need for stimulation in some way. Every other quality/habit/trait I can think of is not one I can draw a confident correlation between. (Except for emotional irregularity in most cases. But that's handled and manifests in many different ways depending on the individual. Not a habit I can write on.) Going back to the need for stimulation, I've found its greater than those with average or lower IQ. Not to say that it comes out in the same way. In Jordan H's answer, she mentioned this came out in her curiosity/need for intellectual stimulation. I'd say this is one way, but not a way that's shared by all with a high IQ. I know many people with a high IQ that've no interest in academics. They're not at all curious. They don't need to be intellectually challenged. In cases like this, I've found that their stimulation is usually fulfilled by one of the following: Drug/substance abuse.Casual sex. A lot of it.Video games or similar.Television, movies and similar.Any other form of entertainment you can think of.A high IQ definitely doesn't mean there's a desire to learn anything. Just a desire to be stimulated in my experience. That's about it. Aside from that, I've not noticed anything I could say most exhibit. Habits vary. Traits vary. Some of the high IQ people I know are the most compassionate I know. Some are the coldest. Some are in between.  I'd say narcissism isn't a shared trait between all those with high IQs. However, I've noticed it's definitely common in successful academics. (IQ is irrelevant in that respect, in my opinion.) Addressing another of the points in the answer I referred to earlier, I've never found myself to be antisocial. I've never found myself judging people based on what they know. I sincerely appreciate authentic conversation. With anyone. Many of my friends are the same.  They often recognise that everyone has something to learn from everyone else. At least that's how we conduct ourselves. I recently addressed this in another answer, you can find that here: Jake Mcspirit's answer to Do very intelligent people enjoy conversations with regular people?  So, I'd say high IQ people share very few similarities. We are as mixed and as varied as every other demographic of people you can think of. Our increased processing speed just means we're actively seeking out stimulation in some form or another more often than those without a high IQ, in my experience. (I do exhibit some OCD traits in my thinking. Some of my friends exhibit these traits in other ways. I'd say, in general, no more than the average person though.) As for some of my own personal habits: I can't abide by a fixed routine, my need for stimulation often won't allow it.I will often eat the same and dress the same most days. I don't often think these things are entirely deserving of much thinking time.I'll often sit and think in hypotheticals. Hours can pass without me doing much of anything beside thinking.I pace while trying to figure something out. That or I'll tap my fingers. This is the only way I'll stay focused and not get frustrated and drop it.My interests vary. Massively. Daily. I'm a polymath, to some degree.I'll take on multiple projects at once. This is another way of how my need for stimulation manifests.I have had a long history of substance abuse.I have had a multitude of mental health problems. I also had a rather rough upbringing, so I attribute more of my mental health problems to that as opposed to my IQ.I LOVE CONVERSATIONS. If you read my answer I linked earlier, you'll get it.Can't think of anything else right now. I'm sure there's more to it. I hope you've enjoyed this window into my mind. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Admitedly I only read a few of the top answers, but I couldn't take it any more. These answers described we're characteristics of high achievement individuals... Not necessarily those with high intelligence. Success is a red herring. People of average and even below average intelligence can be very successful and those with high intelligence can be total disasters driven to compulsive and destructive behaviors by the many detriments that so often come with their \"gifts\".... the label in education circles is called \"twice-exceptional\" and comes as things like high IQ+learning disability (e.g. Einstein was reportedly Dyslexic). Yes there can be a correlation between high intelligence and the drive for achievement but high intellectual capacity does not assure achievement (the kid that sits in the front of the class and answers every question is not necessarily the smartest in the room) determine motivation (any genX slackers out there that didn't \"perform up to their potential\"?) or curiosity. In fact quite the opposite can be just as true. Intelligence is not correlated with self motivation. Think about those folks you've encountered who are the smartest people you've ever met... Are they the most successful?  Were they the valedictorian of every class they were in? Probably not. Also, extreme intelligence will show in many forms... The gregarious polymath... The hyper focused but socially ill equipped genius, etc.  There is no one good answer.  Also think about the brilliant criminal, the sociopath/psychopath and those who suffer psychological illness such as schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder... Strong correlations there with above average intelligence.  and never dismiss the power of hard work. The number 1 predictor of success beyond intelligence is tenacity... or as its popular to call it now, grit. Intelligence helps, but hard work and determination are much stronger predictors of achievement And you will usually call those folks \"smart\". Donald Trump springs to mind... Focused, aggressive, determined and successful without a doubt... But I don't expect his intelligence to be much beyond average.  ",
