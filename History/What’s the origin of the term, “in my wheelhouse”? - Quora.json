            "answer_text": "Well I just used that term in an earlier response, so I looked it up earlier today, wondering the same question. Turns out the wheel in question is a very big wheel, as in the side-wheeled paddle boats that used to ply the Mississippi River (and were written about so engagingly by Mark Twain in his Life on the Mississippi). The housing that covered the out-of-water portion of the wheel was called its \u201cwheel house.\u201d The interesting implication of the phrase, which I\u2019m sure has made it especially popular among tv talking heads on political topics, is that anything INSIDE the wheelhouse will be addressed with considerable force. So it\u2019s become a not-so-subtle way of patting oneself on the back (\u201cjust wait till you ask me a question that IS in my wheelhouse!\u201d) while appearing to be circumspect and deferential.
