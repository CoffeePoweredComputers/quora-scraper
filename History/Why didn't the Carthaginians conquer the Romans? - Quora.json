            "answer_text": "Timing.  Carthage's initial expansion was westward towards Morocco and Spain.  By the time they turned northward to Sicily and Italy, the Romans had become a power in their own right and their Italian conquests were laying the economic and military foundations for a strong empire.  In addition, the Roman army was generally higher quality than the Carthaginian army and while the Roman navy was a complete joke at the start of the First Punic War, it improved rapidly from there. Even then, Carthage came pretty darn close to destroying Rome in the Second Punic War.  Hannibal absolutely destroyed the Roman army at Cannae and may have had enough of an advantage to conquer Rome itself.  Instead, he chose not to and focused on raiding the countryside.  Hannibal had a major opportunity there, but just didn't take it. ",

            "answer_text": "Carthage wasn\u2019t entirely united in the endeavor of fighting Rome. Though they hated the romans, it was the powerful Barca family (of whom Hannibal was a member) which had largely appropriated large parts of modern Spain as their own domain, that was at the vanguard for war against Rome. Carthage, in theory a city state (in practice an empire), was actually a type of republic/oligarchy and the Carthaginian ruling council had mixed opinions on the endeavor,some feared that the Barca family was growing too powerful and could end up taking over Carthage entirely and establish a tyranny or kingdom, once it was done with fighting Rome. Thus they never supported Hannibal and the Barca family as much as they could have. Instead, they had to draw on resources from their own holdings in Iberian peninsular for the campaign. Maybe with more unity they would have supplied Hannibal with more money, which may have given him the extra resources needed to succeed in conquering the romans. ",
