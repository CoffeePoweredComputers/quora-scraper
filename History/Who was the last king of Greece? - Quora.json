            "answer_text": "No one considers either the Bavarian prince Otto (who the German elite forced onto the newly liberated Greek state), nor the Danish princes who insist on claiming a throne they have neither the inheritance rights to nor any legal standing after the referendum of 1974. The last king of Greece was the Emperor Constantine XI Paleologos. He died in 1453 defending Constantinople from the Ottomans. After the City fell, his daughter, Sofia-Zoi Paleologina, married the Russian Grand Prince Ivan III and became the grandmother of Ivan the Terrible. Even if the Eastern Roman Empire (or Byzantine) succession continued within Russia, the royal house of the Greek kings ended with the death of Constantine XI.  ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion,as Constantine regarded himself as a Roman, I prefer to refer to Perseus of Macedon as the last greek king.He styled himself as \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2,or Perseus,king of the greeks,and was the last great greek king before his loss at pydna.Afrer him Rome came, Byzantium(Rome but Eastern style) came and then the ottomans and the false danish princes.Anyhow, historically,the title King of the greeks was last used by Perseus of Macedon.
