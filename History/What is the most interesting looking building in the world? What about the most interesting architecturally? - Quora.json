            "answer_text": "That's a very subjective question to which everyone could have a different answer, even if everyone was aware of all buildings. As an architect, I find most interesting buildings which show that their creators had interesting ideas. Someone mentioned the 'Flatiron' Building and the Sydney Opera House: both are interesting responses to, and both probably outside any brief for the task.  On the above basis - that the concept counts - 'interesting buildings', which should include structures such as bridges, may be small or large, complex or simple.  Among many, I find the Great Pyramid fascinating. Not because of any arcane 'pyramidology', but because the concept behind it - an eternal structure - was executed so well. All buildings, everything in fact, is trying to fall down; to achieve the lowest state of energy. The Great Pyramid has endured substantially in its original form because it was designed as a collapsed structure. It mimics a heap of stones; the shape of maximum 'repose' of a pile of rocks. It can't fall down because it already has, in a sense. And that, with the inclusion of a few internal spaces, is all the building is. Its simplicity and purity is astounding. Other buildings interest because of the ideas behind them and the will of their creators to bring them into being, or because of their impressive use of materials, or in their absolute fitness for their role. An igloo, for example, is a perfect example of necessity being answered by the only materials at hand. Gaudi's Sagrada Familia church is one man's outrageous concept made real. The Taj Mahal is the exquisite embodiment of one man's devotion, and the cathedral at Chartres is a sublime statement of religious faith. The Pantheon in Rome is a conceptual and structural leap, and the Parthenon is a remarkable work of subtlety and precision. Norman Foster's skyscrapers are generally tours de force demonstrating the possibilities of modern design and materials. Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion and Farnsworth House are exercises in stripping architecture to its essentials, and Frank Lloyd Wright's houses are almost alive in the way they interact with human senses. That's only part of one person's long list - so the posted question is a big one. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A.The answer to this question would be very subjective.Interesting is a personal topic - based on this my answer is based on my interests. There are other very interesting / aesthetically pleasant buildings that's not on this list.Yes it's a list as I cannot choose the best (maybe the living tree houses - but they take to long to 'build') So here goes:ANGKOR WAT & OTHER ANCIENT TEMPLES         ADOBE BUILDINGS:      CAVE & UNDERGROUND BUILDINGS:         LIVING TREE HOUSES:    PYRAMIDS:   Why are these buildings interesting:The Adobe, Cave, Underground & Living Tree Houses spell out a path to SUSTAINABILITY over and above the aesthetic. A paradigm shift to being more responsible. The one aspect I find the most interesting in these types of construction is the free flowing lines turned into a functional space. I have included the Temples & Pyramids for the interest in the intricate artworks that vary from miniscule to gigantic and the dedication by the Architect & artists that went into the construction of these buildings. Some other buildings that I find really interesting are buildings built out of necessity. Shelters of twigs, leaves & mud by early man, Igloos, converting caves for habitation & protection etc. My answer does not mean that other buildings are not interesting. Tim Simpson gives a very good answer here. ",
