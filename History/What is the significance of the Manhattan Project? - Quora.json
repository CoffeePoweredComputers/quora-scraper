            "answer_text": "The Manhattan Project resulted in the world's first successful detonation of an atomic weapon, the \"Trinity\" test.  The Trinity Test, July 16, 1945 There are two major results of the United States acquisition of an atomic weapon: (a) the detonation of two atomic blasts at Hiroshima (August 6, 1945) and Nagasaki (August 9, 1945).   (b) the beginning of the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. two atomic blasts  Although the first two blasts were initially credited with bringing World War II to a close, historical evidence has mounted that the war would have likely ended anyway.  The blasts were more likely responsible for avoiding a U.S. land invasion of Japan and avoiding the accompanying loss of American life (though obviously at the cost of a large number of Japanese lives). The other two major reasons atomic weapons were likely used on Japan were (i) the United States, having developed these weapons, had major factions in the military who wanted to see them tested and used in combat; and (ii) the United States was turning its attention from a war with Japan and Germany (the Axis powers) to the coming \"peace,\" after the US and its allies (including the USSR) were victorious.  The U.S. and USSR had signed an agreement in May, 1945 (at Yalta Yalta Conference Milestones: 1937-1945), committing the USSR to assist with a land invasion if the war was not over in three months.  The U.S. was watching the USSR exert a brutal control over eastern Europe and was eager to keep Societ troops out of Manchuria, and thus wished to end the war as quickly as possible, keeping Asia under US auspices. nuclear arms race  It is hard to overstate the importance of the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.  It resulted in a tremendous commitment of resources and occupied the psyche of both nations for several decades.   It is also a major reason for the arms proliferation that has occurred throughout the rest of the developed world in the past few decades. ",

            "answer_text": "I take this to ask whether the development of the A-Bomb was necessary, not whether the project was needed to achieve the result. Yes. Germany was planning along the same lines, and had a working reactor, heavy water supplies and U-235 extraction facilities in place at Peenemunde. The Japanese probably had their own research going on in Manchukuo. If the US did not take Einstein\u2019s advice, the result could well have been the worst disaster to befall the world in all of history. Heisenberg was no fool; the allies had to assume that he eventually would have figured everything that had to be done. After the war, we learned that his only significant mistake was calculating that a higher critical mass was needed to initiate a fission reaction than was in fact required. ",
