            "answer_text": "Kennedy didn't want war. The Russians had appeared to increase their demands making it more likely that the war would happen. The Russians mentioned the US nukes in Turkey and as these were obsolete and due to be decommissioned any way it was an easy bargaining chip for Kennedy to offer. However it would be politically costly for him to publicly agree to it - and so it was kept secret.  ...the president [Kennedy] recognized that, for Chairman Khrushchev to withdraw the missiles from Cuba, it would be undoubtedly helpful to him if he could say at the same time to his colleagues on the Presidium, \"And we have been assured that the missiles will be coming out of Turkey.\" And so, after the ExComm meeting [on the evening of 27 October 1962], as I'm sure almost all of you know, a small group met in President Kennedy's office, and he instructed Robert Kennedy\ufffdat the suggestion of Secretary of State [Dean] Rusk\ufffdto deliver the letter to Ambassador Dobrynin for referral to Chairman Khrushchev, but to add orally what was not in the letter: that the missiles would come out of Turkey Anatomy of a Controversey It's also worth reading The Myth That Screwed Up 50 Years of U.S. Foreign Policy - By Leslie H.

            "answer_text": "The United States thought that pressing the USSR/Khrushchev to far could lead to a hysterical reaction by the Soviets at Gotterdammerung. The US got what it wanted (missiles out of Cuba). Anything else was largely irrelevant to American strategic interests at the time.
