            "answer_text": "Please remember there were more wounded than dead casualties. Civilian fatalities during the WWII. Incl. deaths caused by war related issues like starvation, deceases, etc.( absolute figures. The figures are approximate and may vary some from different sources ). Soviet Union, 17 millionChina, 16 millionPoland, 6 millionIndia ( inc. todays Pakistan and Bangladesh ), 4 millionDutch East Indies, 3,5 millionGermany, 3 millionYugoslavia, 1,3 millionJapan, 1 millionGreece, 0.7 millionPhilippines, 0.6 millionKorea, 0,5 millionFrance, 0.4 millionLithuania, 0.35 millionCzechoslovakia, 0.3 millionBurma, 0.25 millionHungary, 0.25 millionLatvia, 0.22 millionRomaina, 0.2 millionThe Netherlands, 0.2 millionItaly, 0.15 millionMalaya incl. Singapore, 0.1 millionFinland, 0.1 millionBritain, 0,07 millionIn the extreme other end of the scale: USA, 0,01 million (civilian US merchant ship sailors transporting war supplies)WWII fatalites as percent of the population.( civilian and military fatalities ) Poland, 17%Lithuania, 14.5%Soviet Union, 14%Latvia, 12.5%Greece 10%Yugoslavia, 10%Germany, 9%French Indochina, 7%Hungary, 5%Dutch East Indies, 5%Japan, 4%China, 4%Philippines, 3.5%Romania, 3%The Neherlands, 2.5%Finland, 2.5%Czechoslovakia, 2.5%France, 1.5%Burma, 1.5%Belgium, 1%Italy, 1%Papa New Guinea, 1%Britain, 0.9%And again in the extreme other end of the scale: USA, 0.3%In view these undisputable figures, it is most interesting to observe the number 1 position the Westen main powers have placed themselves in the WWII war history and battles to defeat Nazi Germany and Empire Japan. E.g. did the very focused Iwo Jima battle cost 7000 KIA US soldiers.While the Stalingrad battle cost aprox. 0.5 million KIA on either side. There were several almost as big battles on the eastfront.And China fought many far, far bigger battles than the Iwo Jima against Japanese forces in homeland China. How the WWII is presented in USA by the US 75 years WWII VE and VJ anniversity medal. Wonder where has the Soviet flag, and Stalin, and the Chinese flag and Chiang Kai-shek all gone?? All erased from the official US WWII history\u2026? While the British and French flags are shown. Even though France was defeated and surrendered by the legitimate French government in just 6 weeks in May-June 1940\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "The country that suffered the most total casualties in WW2 was generally accepted as the USSR but it has recently been discovered that Stalin ordered special units to remove the ID discs from dead Red Army soldiers to make reported losses lower than those actually sustained but he also added all those who died in the Gulags, starved to death as a result of his policies or who were just executed as being undesirable. So like so many things the official figures from the USSR are suspect. I would suspect that China suffered the highest total of war casualties because they had been fighting the Japanese for at least a decade before WW2 proper began. There are only some very rough estimates for the numbers of Chinese civilians killed as a result of Japanese occupation and military casualties were almost impossible to confirm. ",
