            "answer_text": "The earliest accounts I know of are 2002 when big pharma bought a patent on the novel Corona virus. Could there be another one in the future is what we need to know. In my opinion I have reason to believe this virus has relatives from its family still hibernating either that, or it evolves at an unbelievable rate. In my wildest opinion it can either act on it's own or it is remotely controlled. I may get backlash for this but my \u2018conspiracies' have fulfilled themselves. I am unwavering and only fear myself. In my honest (maybe wildest) opinion, this is the part where song limericks, poems, scriptures, books, history, paintings \u2018prophecies' call it what you want, they were always telling us about where we are now. In their heart -of -hearts people feel what's going on and are trying to adjust but won't go there in conversation. Maybe many have a genuine fear and choose to ignore or accept it and that's very understandable. Other's just live and operate in a state of denial about anything. The one thing I see is the parasites still making a profit off the misery of others. But if that money you released to a bottom feeder in exchange for goods in your survival it's a dollar well spent. Hope for the best expect we already know the rest. I say this as a formal submission to all of you who gaze upon the screen prepare yourselves take caution but dont take oppression. Whatever is coming it's COMING. I don't k know any other way to put it. Now's a time to reflect on self. Nothing is just random. Nothing. History will show you something similar and what it took to get there. Believe actions not words but NEVER take any uttered threat for granted. Take it as face value. I trust my gut. This is far from over, they said this current pandemic is a simulation to prepare us for the real deal threat in the field. In other words we haven't seen anything yet. No ONE is to blame, it's just how it rolls. ",

It was not until the 1960s that the first human corona viruses were identified, so if there has been some epidemic in the past, we would not have known what it was. The future? Yep plenty of options for the future. ",
