            "answer_text": "In vitro gene editing is coming soon to a womb near you. At some point, parents with the proper connections will be able to choose levels of intelligence, athleticism, height, and general disposition as easily as one orders a happy meal at McDonalds. They will have it their way. Modern science isn't far from bringing back extinct creatures either. Harvard and MIT professor George Church, one of the world\u2019s leading geneticists, and his \u2019de-extinction\u2019 project aims to make herds of woolly mammoths \u2013 or at least, animals that closely resemble the massive mammals \u2013 walk again. In practice, the research involves editing the DNA of Asian elephant embryos so they\u2019re born with some of the characteristics of their long-dead cousins, including thick fur, an insulating layer of fat to survive cold conditions, and the ability to release blood oxygen at lower temperatures. Wouldn't that be great? Imagine the safaris that people would take to the Arctic just to get a gander at our long-lost friends - granted that we still have a cold Arctic habitat to put them on. Approximately 30,000 years ago, Neanderthals disappeared. That makes them the most recent, extinct relative of modern humans, as both Neanderthals and humans share a common ancestor from about 800,000 years ago. Chimpanzees diverged from the same primate line some 5 million to 7 million years ago. To understand the genomic differences between present-day humans and Neanderthals, compare the differences in the Neanderthal genome to the genomes found in our DNA, as well as to chimpanzee DNA. The genetic variation of Neanderthal DNA is 99.7 percent identical to present-day human DNA, and 98.8 percent identical to chimpanzee DNA. Present-day human DNA is also 98.8 percent identical to chimpanzee. We've recovered lots of tools and small glimpses of Neanderthal culture from archeological digs across Europe to Sibera. However, very little is known about the Neanderthal as a species. Could they talk? If so, could they form complex sentences? How did they think? Were they sociable? What was it about them or even our relationship to them that made them go extinct? The first Neanderthal genome was sequenced back in 2009 by a finger bone found in Croatia of a young Neanderthal female. Since then 9 other Neanderthals sources have added to our knowledge of the Neanderthal DNA and have helped complete the full genomic picture of a Neanderthal. Remarkably, these genomic sequences are publicly available on the NIH website. Anyone with an advanced CRISPR lab and some embryos could begin the process of bringing back the Neanderthal. Many questions exist that we might never know the answer to unless we bring a Neanderthal back to life. Once created, we could barrage it with a series of tests to decipher different areas of intelligence. Long standing questions about speech and sociability could finally be answered. But the ultimate answer is we'd finally have a clue as to what made us different. Why did we survive when so many other Homo species did not? Similarly to the Wooly Mammoth, creating a Neanderthal is possible by altering the DNA of an existing Homo Sapien embryo by only .3%. Across many of the developed nations, there is an ethical prohibition of any genetic manipulation on a human embryo brought to term. To date, no internationally agreed-upon regulatory framework for gene editing exists, so each country is in the process of evaluating whether, and to what extent, current regulations are adequate for research conducted with, and applications and products related to, gene editing. Barring some nation-state that has a less than stellar track of human rights developing a Neanderthal embryo with human parents, the easiest way to produce a Neanderthal without the ethical stigma would be to alter a chimpanzee embryo by 1.2%. There are 3 billion base pairs in the genomes of human, chimpanzee, and Neanderthal. 1.2% represents 36 million alterations. A large number to edit, certainly, but potentially doable. If a chimpanzee gave birth to a Neanderthal, what rights would the Neanderthal have? While the courts have agreed that chimpanzees share emotional, behavioral, and cognitive similarities with humans, they have denied that chimpanzees are persons on superficial and sometimes conflicting grounds. Consequently, chimpanzees remain confined as legal \"things\" with no rights. Conversely, the major moral and legal question regarding a \"de-extinct\" Neanderthal remains unanswered: would a Neanderthal be a mere \u201cthing\u201d, as the law currently sees chimpanzees, or can they be \"persons\" possessing fundamental rights? As mentioned earlier, the genetic difference between a Sapien and our known Neanderthal genomic sequence is .3% or 9 million base pairs of DNA. The typical difference between the genomes of any two homo sapiens is estimated at 20 million base pairs (or 0.6% of the total of 3.2 billion base pairs). Why is it important that we figure out if a Neanderthal inherently has human rights? As gene editing advances, there will be more and more opportunities for \"designer species\" who are created specifically for different industries ranging from ocean farming to space exploration or simply as caretakers for the elderly. If genes are the only metric of responsibility for rights, then corporations will edit to that marker but could create new species that have intelligence and speech ability as great as the average human. If it is intelligence and speech that define rights, then corporations could create animals who just border current species. The problem with humanity is that it is centered around being human. If we are going to create a just and humane society, we need to come up with a better litmus as to what qualifies as having inherent rights to life and liberty. The way that science is going, the future of our species may no longer be us. We must be prepared for that eventuality. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a touchy subject, because for at least some people, there are some primates we should consider human.  Chimpanzees like Nim Chimpsky, and gorillas like Koko, show a lot of human features, and that's not just anthropomorphization.  Get to know a great ape, and you'll find that they're a lot closer to human than many people are comfortable thinking. One key thing they can't do, however, is talk.  Language is one of the key things that is distinctive to humans, and even people who don't speak the language well are considered outsiders to your group, if not your species.  Koko was able to make a remarkable array of sign language signs, but there's no evidence that she ever mastered grammar even at the level of a five-year-old human.  Nim Chimpsky could definitely understand some spoken words, but there's no evidence that he really mastered what we'd call language.   Mind you, there are are least some humans who never get to that level, either, and we don't consider them out of the \"human\" category. Nobody knows quite what Neanderthals could do, and that would have been important in how people felt about them.  There is some evidence that Neanderthals could talk, in the size of their brains and the structures of their bones, but it's far from conclusive.   Without doubt they used stone tools, and created elaborate funeral ceremonies.  They cared for each other; there are skeletons of individuals who clearly survived injuries and birth defects that they could not have managed on their own. Having an actual Neanderthal in front of us would tell us a lot.  They were certainly more human than any existing animal, and as I said, there are some primates who may deserve more consideration for human-ness than they do.  I might not let a chimp vote, or attend school, but it may be that keeping them in cages is inhuman. Certainly keeping a Neanderthal in a cage would be inhuman.  As for whether I'd allow it to vote... hell, there are an awful lot of people I'd remove that privilege from, if I could.  Neanderthals can't do it any worse than we do. ",
