            "answer_text": "In a sense, it has happened at least three times \u2014 and each time, due to the electoral college\u2026 not the electoral college itself, but by the vote of a small panel or committee that made a ruling on the elections. Although\u2026 if you do count the electoral college, George W. Bush won the electoral college with just 1 elector to spare. Which means that if Gore could\u2019ve convinced just 2 electors to switch from Bush to him, he would\u2019ve become president. I think he correctly concluded, though, that wasn\u2019t going to work, no matter how many things had gone wrong with the Florida 2000 presidential election\u2026 Because you see, the 538 electors are not a group of \u201cwise people\u201d as Hamilton might have wanted \u2014 they are chosen because they are party hacks. So, those Republican party hacks were never, ever going to vote for Gore. Now, as to the other cases\u2026. Going back to 2000 again. There are arguments as to who really won Florida, had the recount continued. Some say that Bush would\u2019ve won anyway. However, what did end the recount, essentially declaring Bush the winner, was the 5\u20134 decision in Bush v. Gore from the Supreme Court. That can be considered a case where one vote made someone president. An even worse case happened in the infamous Tilden v. Hayes election (1876). Democrat Tilden won the popular vote by 3%, a significant margin. He also won the electoral college with 19 elector votes to spare. BUT THEN\u2026 The Republicans contested several of the states\u2026 enough states to potentially switch 20 electoral votes, precisely enough to flip the election if they got all 20. A supposedly independent commission was formed to settle the dispute, but it was deadlocked for a long time. Finally, a deal was struck to end Reconstruction. The result was that this dirty deal caused the one abstaining member of the commission to throw his vote to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes. The result of this dirty deal was that the commission awarded all 20 disputed electoral votes to Hayes\u2026 which resulted in Hays winning the electoral college with one vote; that is, no votes to spare. The other time\u2026 the third time? (Actually it was the first.) In the election of 1800, Jefferson and Aaron Burr got the same number of votes. Before the 12th amendment (1802), electors each had two votes but they were undifferentiated. The Democratic-Republicans forgot to withhold a vote for Burr, who was supposed to become VP. The election was thrown to the House of Representatives, which was deadlocked for 36 ballots. At last, one of the delegations supporting Burr (doing this deliberately to frustrate Jefferson), had ONE MEMBER who switched to voting for Jefferson, thus allowing Jefferson to finally declare victory. So that would be the first example of how one vote \u2014 in this case a Congressman\u2019s \u2014 made someone president. ",

            "answer_text": "No. But it\u2019s not the simple, and there are issues that need to be understood. To be precise, we have to distinguish between an election being decided by a single vote, which could happen, and an election being decided correctly by a single vote, which is extremely unlikely to happen. After all, not all votes are correctly counted. There is a (very small) amount of voter fraud, a (somewhat larger) amount of election fraud, and (a small but still too large amount) of vote mis-counting, i.e. incorrect handwriting matches, damaged ballots, \u201changing chads,\u201d improperly but not maliciously discarded ballots, etc. These miscounts, in effect, contribute random noise to the vote. Given that there is random noise in the vote, there is an implicit signal to noise ratio in the vote. For us to be confident that the vote is correct, the margin of victory must exceed the noise floor by some significant margin, say 2 standard deviations, i.e. a 95% chance that the victory was not just random. It\u2019s clear enough that in most Presidential elections, the margin of victory is big enough to be quite confident of the result, but that\u2019s not always the case. In other words, a very close election will have a victor, but who that is might just be a statistical fluke, and not reflect an actual majority of the voters. The closest Presidential election in recent history was in 2000, when the vote was so close that Florida state law required a recount. Bush won Florida by 537 votes, a margin of 0.009%. We do not know what the \u201cnoise floor\u201d in the Florida count was, but most observers believe that if Florida had completed its statewide recount, which was stopped by the Supreme Court, the result of the election would have been a victory for Gore instead of for Bush.[1] That is pretty strong evidence that the Bush victory was a statistical fluke caused by random problems with the vote.

The margin of error in counting ballots makes the notion of a single vote difference deciding an election TOO CLOSE TO CALL \u2026 it\u2019s within the margin of error and indeterminable.
