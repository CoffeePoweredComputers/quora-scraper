(Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell)    Currently, at the cabinet level, you have Jason Furman, the Chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisers and the Secretary of the Treasury, Jack Lew who wear glasses.  Then, you have Al Franken from MN, probably the most popular liberal currently in the Congress.   Last of all, a certain DICK CHENEY staring right at ya!  ",
