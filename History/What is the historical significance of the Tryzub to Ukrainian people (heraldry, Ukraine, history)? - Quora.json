            "answer_text": "Tryzub was the dynastic symbol of Rurikid dynasty, which ruled Kyiv from the 9th century. The first known depiction of tryzub as a trident is found on the coins minted by Prince Volodymyr (Vladimir the Great), who ruled Rus' between 980 and 1015.  A coin showing Volodymyr with a tryzub After the disintegration of Rus', its successor states in Ukraine used different symbols, including a lion (Galicia), an eagle (Chernihiv), a cross (Volhynia), the Sun (Podillia), Michael the Archangel (Kyiv) and others. Starting from the 16th century, Ukrainian Cossacks used a seal depicting a Cossack warrior holding a musket. After Ukrainian autonomy was proclaimed in 1917, there existed many proposals for a coat of arms, which contained many of the previously used symbols.  Proposed variants for a coat of arms of Ukraine, 1917[1] In December 1917, Ukraine introduced its new currency called karbovanets. The banknotes were adorned by the tryzub of Prince Volodymyr, and this symbol began to be associated with Ukrainian statehood. In 1918, Ukraine proclaimed independence, and tryzub became the country's official coat of arms.  Coat of arms of the Ukrainian People's Republic In April 1918, Pavlo Skoropadsky, an aristocrat from an old Cossack family, overthrew the Ukrainian government with German support and had himself proclaimed hetman (military ruler) of Ukraine. A new coat of arms was developed for his regime, known as Ukrainian State. It depicted the old Cossack coat of arms combined with a tryzub. However this design was never officially approved, as Skoropadsky was deposed in late 1918, and the original Ukrainian People's Republic was reinstated.  Proposed coat of arms of the Ukrainian State After its final defeat in 1921, Ukrainian People's Republic became a government in exile and continued using tryzub as its symbol. Many rival Ukrainian organizations, like the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, also adopted variants of tryzub. Finally, after Ukrainian independence was restored in 1991, tryzub was reinstated as the coat of arms of Ukraine.

            "answer_text": "The tryzub, or trident, had no real historical significance for the present state of Ukraine or its people. It was a symbol that appeared on coins minted by the early Rurikid rulers of Kiev/Kyiv, but was not used as a political symbol thereafter. None of the various polities that existed on the territory of present-day Ukraine, such as the principalities that existed prior to the Mongol invasion of 1240, or the Cossack Hetmanate that came into being after the secession from the Polish-Ukrainian Commonwealth, ever used it as an identifying political symbol. It was only in the 19th Century that secessionists who wished to create an independent state called Ukraine, separate from the Russian Empire, decided to adopt the tryzub as the symbol of that projected state.
