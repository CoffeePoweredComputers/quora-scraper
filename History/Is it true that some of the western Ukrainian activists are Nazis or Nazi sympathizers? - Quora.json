            "answer_text": "The question in present tense, so i will answer as for today. Yes there are groups of youngsters that like nazi attributes and atmosphere. This kind of groups exist in every country and Ukrainian groups aren\u2019t special or bigger. If you mean past then: No ,there were no fans of Nazi ideology since people of Ukraine knew nothing about ideology and it was radically different from what they believed in. Yes, some of Ukrainians allied with Germans, but not because they like colors of German uniform or were eager to burn Jews alive. The thing is that Soviet union was a much bigger enemy for Westerners then German. Holodomor was still fresh in memory of people, hundreds of thousands of people send to camps and shot. If i live in country that treats me like a pile of dirt i would be glad to have any chance to change situation and a lot of Ukrainians grabbed the chance to get rid of Soviets. Of course \u201cgood German\u201d illusion fade away when nationalist try to announce free Ukrainian republic in Lviv and were punished by Germans for that. Next time when someone will mention Bandera as a \u201cfascist, monster\u201d,ask them where was Bandera since 5 July 1941 till August 1944. The answer is: he spend 4 years of war in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Russian propaganda portrays him as a monster that personally ate half of Red army, but the answer is simple. His man had been fighting soviets till 1952 when last partisan squad was annihilated. Another thing i always mention. Print out Nuremberg trials logs and try to find Bandera, OUN-UPA or other nationalistic groups accused in any kind of crimes-you won\u2019t find a thing. All this attempts to put an equal sign between western Ukrainians and Nazis comes from Moscow, whos citizens served in several SS divisions,ROA army, preparation of German pilots and officers in USSR training facilities, German-Soviet parade in Brest before the war. Level of hypocrisy is enormous. ",

            "answer_text": "Ukrainian nationalist figures were indeed Nazi symoathizers, especially Bandera had Nazi title as well. Bandera sitting with other Nazi SS in Nazi SS uniform:    These Ukranian nationalist armies were responsible for horrific pogroms which murdered Jews (innocent Russians and Poles too). My own great grandparents, their parents and most of their children were brutally murdered by these pogroms. Perhaps Ukrainians (esp. West Ukraine) today are not of the same mentality as in ww2, but it is shameful for the Ukrainian people and government to deny this part of its history, and to instead award medals of national hero to them as the case recently.  Ukraine is one of the most xenophobic cultures in Europe, not liking anyone else than Ukrainians pretty much.  Having said that, while the revolution in Ukraine has some fascist sideline support from some extremist parties, and its history has a lot of hatred toward non Ukrainians, the mentality of people in Ukraine has shown a lot of change for the positive and the revolution has been started by genuine protestors being fed up with extreme corruption and wanting change. There is very pro Putin propaganda happening that touts the whole thing as pro Nazi sympathisers trying to get to power, when it's not true either. ",
