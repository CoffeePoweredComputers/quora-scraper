            "answer_text": " Devi or Vedisa-Mahadevi Sakyakumari was the first wife of the third Mauryan emperor Ashoka. She was the daughter of one merchant of Vedisagiri or present day Vidisha. She is called Devi or Sakyani. Ashoka married her when he was the Viceroy within Ujjain. He was sent to end the turbulence within Ujjain. He saw Devi and was mesmerised when he saw her beauty. He requested her father to allow him marry her because he loved her. Devi was wise and kept one demand in front of Ashoka. The demand was to end the turbulence of Ujjain without violence. The Mahabodhivamsa says that Devi had come from the clan of Shakyas. Ashoka and Devi had close relationship and they loved each other. Two children were born to Devi who were one daughter Sanghamitra and one son called Mahendra. Sanghamitra was born three years after Mahendra. Devi didn't convert Ashoka to Buddhism. When Ashoka went to Pataliputra his wife Sakyani and their children stayed within Vidisha. His chief wife within Pataliputra was the lovely Asandhimitra. It wasn't suitable for Ashoka to make merchant's child his chief queen. Asandhimitra was one princess and that's why she was made the chief queen. The Ceylonese Chronicles tell the stories of Ashoka and Sakyani's love. They both loved each other and Sakyani was the love of Ashoka. She was the mother of his first two children. Sakyani was special for him. ",
