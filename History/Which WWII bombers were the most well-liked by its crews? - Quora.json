            "answer_text": "The Mosquito and the Wellington were both loved by the RAF. The Mosquito for its speed and elegant lines, and the Wellington for its ability to soak up a huge amount of damage. The Red Air Force\u2019s IL-2M was liked by its crews as a big improvement from the earliest days of the Sturmovik. The increased armament, more solid wings, while still keeping the incredible amount of armour made it respected by crews. The Luftwaffe bomber crews quite liked the Dornier Do-17. It was a schnellbomber, (designed to outrun fighters) and had excellent handling, making it harder to hit. Its poor bomb load saw it replaced by the Ju-88. The G4M3 version of the \u201cBetty\u201d was a welcome improvement on the original Japanese bomber, with self-sealing fuel tanks, crew armour and a better tail turret design. Unfortunately for the Japanese, these improvements were fairly late in the war. The B17G was popular with their USAAF crews. The B17 had already shown how much punishment it could soak and still fly home, but the nose turret was a welcome addition, providing a way to deal with the Luftwaffe\u2019s frontal attacks. ",

I remember reading that its crews loved it. One from left field I guess, but the very first that popped into my head when I read the question. ",

Only have experience of the Lancaster , inside , the B52 is awesome , even bombers are fighter planes as such . Drop the payload , get home . Little space for a flight attendant :-) . ",
