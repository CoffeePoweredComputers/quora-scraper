            "answer_text": "Far more than two cities were bombed, and thoroughly destroyed, in Japan in WW2. I know, this is a Quora question designed to try and make \u201cmoney\u201d by asking an \u201cobvious\u201d question. But the question is asked from the commonly held uneducated understanding that \u201conly\u201d \u201ctwo\u201d Japanese cities were \u201cbombed\u201d in WW2. Many are only taught the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d history that here was Japan, sitting there with butterflies and Geisha girls, and those dirty mean Americans cruelly dropped atom bombs on them without warning. Of course, anyone with slightly more education than that knows that a strategic bombing campaign had been going on for a while, and at least 42 major Japanese urban centers had already been destroyed by conventional bombing raids of 300, 500, 700 bombers at a time, before any atomic bomb was dropped. Five months before the atomic bombs, Tokyo was bombed and destroyed by massive conventional raids and by some estimates, more people were killed in Tokyo than by both later atomic bombings, combined. Oh, you didn\u2019t know that? Now you do. Ask a real question. ",
