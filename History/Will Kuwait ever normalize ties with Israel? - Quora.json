            "answer_text": "It probably depends on how badly Kuwait needs Israel. You see until recently Israeli leaders believed that to get the Arab states to accept Israel, Israel needed to give away land vital to its defense (making itself weaker). In reality, Arab countries do what is in their best interest. making peace with a weak Israel is not in their interest. Bahrain and the UAE are making peace with Israel (with Saudi\u2019s blessing) because Israel is strong and they believe Israel can help defend them against Iran and Turkey and also be a route for their oil to the West if Iran closes the Straight of Hormuz (One of the reasons Iran is so upset, their constant threats to close the Straight of Hormuz will become useless). Hopefully eventually Kuwait will realize it can benefit from ties with Israel and join the movement towards peace in the Middle East. ",
