            "answer_text": "Who\u2019s buried in Grant\u2019s tomb? The answer is in the title. Cultural anthropology is the study of culture, all cultures including your own, and how those cultures came to be, how they function, how they interact, what the political and social structures are, what is adaptive and non-adaptive. The reason people who successfully study cultural anthropology ar more qualified then others without the same training to enter and learn about other cultures is that we've learned not to go in like Clint Eastwood and demand rigorous change to our way of thinking without understanding why things are the way they are. In one of my first anthro classes, I learned about an Eskimo tribe who traded with sailors in port every year for generations.They came to rely on \u201cmodern\u201d trapping methods provided by the visitors. One year, the ship didn't show and a great number of the tribe died of starvation. The tribal knowledge of how to trap without the \u201cmodern\u201d traps provided through trade had been lost. It's an important lesson for anyone who engages with another culture. Don't go changing things based on your personal value system. The consequences could be disasterous. Not to be too much of a geek, but I've been binge watching StarGate SG1. Somewhere in season 3, there was an episode that jumped on every one of my anthropologist nerves. The team encountered a civilization that used nano technology in select children to increase learning. When that child turned 12, the nanites (sp?) were extracted and distributed to the population, disemanating the information very effectively but leaving the child for all intents and purposes at the intellectual level of an infant. To Col. O\u2019Neil, this was \u201cbarbaric\u201d and \u201c\"unthinkable.\u201d So he abducted the child in an effort to change her mind and convince her to seek sanctuary. Why was that culture so wrong and backward? Because it was judged according to our values! Need I say I hated that episode. I wanted to reach through the television and smack Col.O\u2019Neil. What gave him the right? What would be the conse of his choice? Did he even consider the impact he would have on an entire population?? What kind of dumbass writers were behind that script? Can I still find them and bitch them out? I can't abide that kind of arrogance and neither can anyone else trained as a cultural anthropologist. Be careful! Ask questions before you go blindly mucking things up. Understand the consequences of your actions. You aren't God and any action needs to be carefully considered. That is the essence of cultural anthropology. ",
