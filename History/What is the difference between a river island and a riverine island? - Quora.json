            "answer_text": "Absolutely no difference in geomorphic context. And I don't think there is any significant difference. A river island or riverine island is very much the same physical feature. A river island is an island that is formed due to the action of the river- it maybe entirely within the river or may have an ocean coast. The latter is true for many of the islands in the delta of Ganga in Bangladesh. The word riverine refers to anything relating to a river. Riparian is a similar word. So riverine island should necessarily mean an island formed by river. Another important thing to be noted is that these islands are never permanent. They are actively being eroded by the enormous might of the rivers such as Amazon, Yangtze Kiang, Brahmaputra, Ganga, Paran\u00e1, etc. It is a known fact that the largest river island in India- Majuli island in Assam, has reduced in size due to the erosive nature of Brahmaputra. So it is wise not to inhabit these areas for a long time or make it your home. I guess the question has been answered. ",

            "answer_text": "A riverine island is a specific type of river island. The major difference between a river island and a riverene island is that riverine means relating to or resembling a river such as the many islands formed in Bangladesh near the mouth of the Brahmaputra.  There may be countless many of them. These are not the same, they are being eroded continuously. Whereas a river island is just a permanent island in the regular section of a river. So the main difference is that riverine is more open ended in its interpretation. ",
