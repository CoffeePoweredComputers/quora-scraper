            "answer_text": "Simply put, it wasn\u2019t. If you believe what you see in Hollywood movies than you could be forgiven for thinking that Medieval people saw \u2018witches\u2019 under every rock, but the truth is that they didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve linked some articles highlighting some of the common misconceptions about the witch-hunts and witchcraft in the Medieval period. A brief history of medieval magic Common Errors about Witch Hunts One point that needs to be made here is that Medieval people had a totally different attitude to religion then we are used to now. For example, most Medieval Europeans believed relics had supernatural power. The the bones of a Saint, or the remnants of their clothing, even soil from their graves could heal the sick or have miraculous power. They also believed the certain natural substances such as herbs, as well as some rocks and minerals had certain properties. Some also believed in astrology, but all of the above beliefs were considered entirely consistent with mainstream religious teaching and ideology.  As far as the church was concerned, God made the stars, and he made plants and trees and rocks, so it was entirely legitimate for people to harness the natural properties of these things, or use them to tell the future. They also taught that Saints were special people, who had a sort of direct link to God in heaven, so it was perfectly acceptable to pray to them, and believe items associated with them had special power.  (A page from a Medieval text in the British Library depicting the believed influence of different astrological signs and alignments on body parts and functions). Second, if you read Medieval Literature, especially the Arthurian legends you notice one thing. Everyone knew figures like Merlin was a wizard, but nobody cared. Why? Because Merlin\u2019s \u2018magic\u2019 was presented as entirely within the remit of Christian beliefs and theology. He was considered to be a prophet, akin to the ones in the Bible, and his supernatural birth wasn\u2019t his fault.  (Image from a 13th century manuscript depicting Merlin, the standing figure on the left, dictating his prophecies) Basically, a lot of beliefs or activities that we would now call \u2018magic\u2019 were considered entirely acceptable in the Medieval period, as long as you invoked God, prayed to the Saints, made the sign of the cross, or wrote the names of the Apostles whilst doing them. All of them were considered an entirely acceptable and legitimate source of power and assistance. Read some Anglo-Saxon \u2018charms\u2019 for example. All invoke Mary or Jesus, or some Saint or another. There even seem to have been cases of people taking the bread that the priest had blessed in church, to spread on their fields and help crops grow. Although the clergy weren\u2019t too keen on the idea of people using the sacrament in such a way, to do so wasn\u2019t \u2018witchcraft\u2019: it was probably just considered hollow superstition or mildly sacrilegious. Where the Medieval church and authorities drew the line was necromancy, or what they considered to be using diabolic power. Basically, devil worship or a person who was considered to get their power from Satan and Demons, or consulting with the spirits of the dead. So, when people really did get into trouble, what they tended to be accused of was called necromancy or \u2018sorcery\u2019. Relatively few people, however, were actually accused of these things. And even fewer were convicted and executed. Famously, in the High Middle Ages, the church actually taught that people who said they were witches and had supernatural power were delusional and should be pitied instead of being punished. The authorities seem to have held that these kind of beliefs were something that ignorant rustics held to, but not sensible educated, cosmopolitan people. The Medieval Church was concerned with heresy, NOT witchcraft per se. The problem is that people often conflate the two, or fail to understand the different. Denying the authority of the Pope, rejecting transubstantiation, or the resurrection could be considered heretical. But it wasn\u2019t witchcraft. The Templars were executed for heresy. Not witchcraft. European witchcraft - Wikipedia The real paranoia about witchcraft really started in the 16th and 17th century. In fact, trail by Ordeal, which many people (wrongly) believe to have been a common practice in Medieval witch hunts, was actually banned by the Pope in the year 1215, because he believed it was wrong to invoke God to mediate in petty human squabbles. It was bought back by the Puritans in England in the 17th century. Modern Wicca is not related in any way, shape or form to Medieval beliefs about \u2018witchcraft\u2019. In fact, you barely see that word \u2018witchcraft\u2019 used in the Middle Ages. Its a modern religion based on nature worship. Many of the actual practices of ancient and Early Medieval paganism would quite simply be illegal today. A historian debunks seven annoying myths people always get wrong ",

            "answer_text": "trying to control a hostile world is always difficult and can stretch the imagination not to mention the back. The Middle Ages we're horrific times with a handful in power and very short life spans. Witchcraft with its quick answers , obvious attempt to control the situation, not to mention the power it gives to those who would normally be a victim of that world. Who would not want to Dabble in such power. So of course the greatest power in the Middle Ages, the church went after witches the hardest. Such is the price of power. Today the only Danger is people laugh at you behind your back. But you'll always find plenty who need and are willing to believe. Not many burning at the stake these days. I consider that a good trade-off .fear which was rampant in the Middle Ages always finds an answer you can live with. ",
