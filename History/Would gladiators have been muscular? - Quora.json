            "answer_text": " In 1993, an ancient cemetery was found in Ephesus (western part of Turkey), the former capital of the Roman province of Asia. Scientists had two suspicions suggesting that this is a mass grave of gladiators. Ephesus was the place where gladiator fights took place \u2013 we have many artifacts from this place, including graffiti, indicating that they have taken place since 69 BCEMost of the buried remains had critical injuries, indicating death after dramatic events.Ephesus was once a powerful eastern city with over 200,000 inhabitants. The mass grave found had an area of \u200b\u200bapproximately 19m\u00b2, in which over 60 young gladiators were buried. The burial site was on the road leading to the temple of Artemis \u2013 the Greek goddess of hunting; this building was one of the famous seven wonders of the world. Scientists have conducted detailed studies of the bones and skulls of buried men. The conclusions were surprising: the gladiator diet was, in our opinion, very vegetarian and rich in carbohydrates. After the isotope analysis, it turned out that gladiators ate much more vegetables and less meat compared to the rest of the city\u2019s inhabitants. Hence the colloquial term for gladiators \u2013 hordearii, or \u201ceating barley\u201d. What\u2019s more, the gladiators were not perfectly muscled men, but rather had significant amounts of fat. They ate mainly wheat, barley (of rather inferior quality), legumes (e.g. broad beans) in order to acquire significant amounts of subcutaneous fat. It was extremely helpful in the arena, because it protected the most important parts of the body such as ligaments, nerves, blood vessels from cutting. This guaranteed a better spectacle for the masses because the gladiators were wounded, cut and bloody bodies were visible, but they were still fighting in the arena. A diet based on cereal products, however, caused significant calcium deficiencies. To keep the bones strong, a special decoction of charred wood (or plants) and bone ash, which was very rich in calcium, was drunk. In this way, the bones could regenerate faster and were much more durable. Compared to the bones of the other inhabitants of Ephesus, gladiators had really strong bones. So it was an early form of supplementation.  more you can read here: Nutritional secrets of gladiators \u00ab IMPERIUM ROMANUM ",
