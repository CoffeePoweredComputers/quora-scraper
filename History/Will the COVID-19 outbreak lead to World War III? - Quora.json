            "answer_text": "Not the disease itself - that\u2019s nothing, but the mentality of the people manipulating you about it. Leaders are ruthless and War is the most profitable of all activities so by frightening the population they will cause it. Only a proper democracy where the leaders are controlled by the society could save us. I wrote this recently concerning coronavirus. \"I am suspicious about potential exaggeration of the Coronavirus crisis as I notice a particular thing is happening, namely that we are being fed data rather than information. The effect is excitation because with data there is neither context nor comparison and dimensional testimony that information provides. If information, rather than data, was the basis of interchange we might expect a report like this. \"Since December 2019 the World Health Organisation has been aware of the outbreak and spread of a disease called Coronavirus. So far the disease is said to have been contracted by 823,000 people in all being 0.01% of the World Population. It is worth noting that of those 600,000 current sufferers 95% are considered to be in mild condition and only 5% Serious or Critical. There seems to be no real understanding of how the infection is spread because there isn't much evidence that those countries in lockdown are in a better position than those which are not. For instance Italy and Spain are at 40 times the Global Average, France 10, Iran 7, Sweden 4, US 2, but Turkey below just as a simple example. The worst affected country is Italy where over the past 2 months there have been12,428 deaths. This equates to a death rate of 206 per million or 0.02% annualising at 0.12% provided the number of sufferers increases for the coming 10 months which we sincerely hope it does not and shouldn't do because Flu is normally associated with colder weather. We should bear in mind - for context and comparison - that 25,000 people died in the 2016/17 Flu Epidemic in Italy as part of what was then thought of as the normal and unavoidable periodic mutation and cycling of flu strains. This paper takes serious issue with World Governments, all but one of whose societies are - so far - less affected than Italy to make sure that a disease of this kind and at this stage of its progression be watched carefully and the sufferers taken care of, but the safety of those within vulnerable and marginal society groups not be endangered by economic collapse and dislocation of services which would seem to be an unavoidable consequence of the chosen method for defeating the illness. We have no idea where socio-economic trauma might lead us, but mass unemployment would cause misery and considerable shortening of lives and possibly many deaths depending on the remaining cohesiveness of the society, so people who wish to and consent must be allowed to go about their normal lives. By the contextual and level-headed standards of the rules of logic and reason a disease such as this should not lead to the extremeness of reaction we are witnessing. We would like the Government to inform us of their studies, particularly as to how many members of society they are willing to see harmed or killed in order to continue this campaigm to its conclusion?\"\" More important than my ramblings is this link from a professional epidemiologist  Do not trust world leadership on anything - though, curiously, the one closest to common sense is actually the hated Trump - and demand a democracy where the populace stands sovereign over the State otherwise we willget disaster after disaster.

            "answer_text": "It is only an opinion and a theory .. yet it's not baseless either. World War III has already started somewhere around Jan 2020. It is US, UK, France and the Corporate world against Russia and China. Covid-19 is a weapon that was launched against spesificly 2 countries . Yet with this reason the global elite will remove huge amount of enemies in the world such as in Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Vietnam, Algeria and many other countries. (North Korean Leader is already gone and his dummy is walking around and Venezuela's president caught dozens of Americans who wanted to do assault on goverment forces cought yesterday. Coup in Qatar, and many many stories happening behind the curtains ) Covid 19 is only being imitated in US and UK and France to show high death rate even by people who are dying by other causes, this is already a fact and not a conspiracy theory. Phase-1 of the attack happened already and now phase-II started where they are eliminating high profile scientists and working class in strategic industries such as submarine factories , airspace and many money key workers and scientists. Basically the US is striping Russia and China from there working class that can make a diffence in the war. Now the new trend is to open the countries and that is a trap that Russia and part of China are entering in to. US and the corporate world has an objective to feed you and indirectly other countries that soon something positive might happen. But its just to give you fake hope to keep you waiting while they achieve there plan phase by phase In 2 to 4 month time the death toll in Russia and China will reach unbearable toll and waiting will not be an option .. the russians and Chinese will retaliate with there own virus or similar response otherwise they will lose that chance all together. That part of the war is unpredictable and things might go not as per the plan of US, UK and France and things might turn to hot war. Yes, people reading might think that the death toll in UK, US and France are huge , yet they are sacrificing few thousand in there own country and the rest of the statistics are fake , as any dead body in US and UK are not allowed to be investigated and do otopcy . Another way of covering up for the crimes comited. As always, every war ends up ugly and this one is no exception and it will not go as smooth as the people who planed it in the coming 2 to 4 month. Brace your self , things are about to get ugly very soon \u2026 I hope I'm totally and utterly wrong \u2026 for the first time, I would feel happy if someone would make fun of me and say that I was wrong after 4 month \u2026 ",
