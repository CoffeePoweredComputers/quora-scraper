            "answer_text": "I happen to be very fond of the the L-88 427 engines. This fondness is directly related to personal experience as I had the chance to drive a 1968 L-88 Corvette back in 1973. It was by far the fastest car I\u2019ve ever driven and I remember it fondly to this day. And I could have purchased that car for around $2,800.00 back then. But I could not have afforded the insurance. Today a nice example will sell for over a million dollars. I still have nightmares about that!!! Not only would I like to be a millionaire but I\u2019d just love to drive that damned thing again\u2026 \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. Even though I\u2019m almost 66 years old. But I digress\u2026 The L-88 was a race engine that you could order as an option in the 1967 through 1969 Corvettes; if you and your dealership could navigate the Central Office Production Order process. Along with a sturdy lower end, it had a radical solid lifter camshaft, 12.5 to 1 compression ratio, aluminum cylinder heads, aluminum high rise intake and 850 cfm Holley carburetor. You could drive it on the street but it wasn\u2019t pleasant. Rated at a conservative 430hp it produced a realistic 550hp. Just a little over 200 Corvettes were built with the L-88 option during the production run. However\u2026. The L-88 Corvettes would be trumped by the ZL-1 1969 Camaros. The ZL-1 was essentially a L-88 engine with an aluminum block. It was only available in the 1969 Camaro through, again, a Central Office Production Order (COPO). I think only 50 or so of these vehicles were built and are extremely valuable today. I love Chevy big blocks. I\u2019ve owned both a 396 and 454 Chevelle. And my boat has a 454 engine. But to illustrate the strides we have made in engine efficiency and performance, a well tuned and driven L-88 or ZL-1 would be around a 12 second car in the quarter mile. My son-in-law has a late model Mustang. 5.0 liter engine. Whipple supercharger. Bigger injectors. Performance tune. And a few other odds and ends. You can drive it anywhere in comfort and get 20 mpg. And it\u2019s a 10.5 second car. Scares the heck out of me!!! ZL-1 Engine  ZL-1 Camaro\u2026 Doesn\u2019t look like much, does it?  Pictures courtesy of Google. ",

            "answer_text": "thats an easy one for me. the best big block chevy engine is the 454. the 454 could be had from mild to wild . powered station wagons , pick up trucks , boats and were a favourite for tractor pulls . reliable big torque engine for trailer towing the 454 was a very good robust engine that could tackle any big job. i remember i was in GEORGIA IN 1974 and the state trooper came in the gas station we were at and he was driving a 1974 chev with 454 on the fender. even the cops liked them. i remember when i was in trade school and we had a donated 1973 caprice fully loaded with a 454 . it was on a car carrier that fipped so the trade school got it and repaired it. so we put it on the dyno and it pulled 255 horses at the rear wheels which i thought was pretty damn impressive for a smog engine.
