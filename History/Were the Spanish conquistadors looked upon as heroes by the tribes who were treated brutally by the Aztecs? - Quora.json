            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. They viewed them as a party that could help them take the Aztecs from power. Of course, those who were allies looked on them as such, & in some cases the Spaniards had to enforce coups d\u2019\u00e9tat on these kingdoms to force their submission. This happened particularly to the states around the Texcoco Lake. On the other hand, empires like Tzintzuntzan (Tarascan state) got certainly nervous with the fall of the Aztecs, despite having been enemies & being neutrals at the time of Spanish arrival. Poor decisions provoked their fall. The ones you ask actually view the Spaniards as allies, but not as saviors. Let\u2019s remember that Spain was one of three factions that brought down Tenochtitlan: they did not arrive like overpowered US Marines \u2013let\u2019s remember there were Spanish soldiers that ended up at the top of the pyramids as sacrifices & that there are accounts of a horse losing its head to Aztec obsidian-clubs\u2013. Even if there were technological differences, it was not Medieval Europe vs Halo\u2019s Covenant. Over time, most of those peoples ended up under poorly managed \u2018encomienda\u2019 systems (a good intention with a terrible implementation). Although, Tlaxcala was granted a level of autonomy seen to this day. ",
