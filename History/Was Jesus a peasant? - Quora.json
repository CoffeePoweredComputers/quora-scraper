            "answer_text": "NO!!!!! If we read Josephs linage, we find that they were all the ruling kings of Judah, up until  captivity. However, even when a nation is subject to another, the royal line still continues to be the royal line.. they just are not actually sitting on the throne and ruling.  So what we have is a direct line from Joseph to the ruling kings of Israel.. that makes Joseph the rightful heir to the throne of Judah. There are many indicators to Jesus wealth in the Bible. Most obvious is the the verse. \"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.\" (2 Cor 8:9) which tells us point blank that he was not a peasant, but rich. There's the fact that his cloak was only one piece (when the soldiers were going to divide his cloak at the crucifixion). Only the MOST wealthy could afford to have a cloak made from a single piece of cloth.. most cloaks were made of several pieces.We have Mary and Jesus at a high society wedding, with Mary ordering the servants.. Since when would a high society person even invite a peasant to their wedding... much less let them order the servants??? But royalty? oh yes if they ordered the servants it would be accepted ..We have that Jesus was called a rabbi, the Jews would never call some poor untrained person a rabbi, only those who had gone through years of training and schooling.. which cost $$  ( the same as it does today).We have the customary trips to Jerusalem for the Passover, only the wealthy could afford to go regularly, same as traveling cost today. the poor don't travel much.We also have Jesus discussing God with the priests while there at the Passover, the priest would not have taken time during such a busy event for a poor  common boy, the the heir to the throne Israel though, would be,a different story.We have the  Pharisees going to the Romans with the claim Jesus was  going to usurp the Romans authority and  be king. How could they get away with such a claim? Because through Joseph, Jesus was the heir to the throne of Judah. If Jesus had been a poor peasant, the Romans would have laughed their heads off at the Pharisees  being worried about Jesus claiming  kingship, and would have dismissed it as  \"some poor crazy delusional fool\", no threat at all to the Roman rule. Even Pilot  recognized Jesus right place as heir to the throne of Judah during  his questioning of Christ. To which Jesus replied \" My kingdom is not of this world\". There is Jesus conversation to the rich young ruler who asked how to be saved. Jesus said to him \" Give all your goods to the poor and follow me\". Jesus was saying \"Do as i have done, be like me, Give your wealth to the poor just as I have given my wealth to the poor\" This is also why the early church sold all their extra  goods and gave the money to the poor, they were following what Jesus had done. One of the greatest lies ever perpetuated is that Jesus was poor. Mankind likes to think that Christ was poor, because then it's OK for them to pursue and keep their riches for themselves and still think they are \"following\" Christ. If Christ didn't have riches to give away, then they don't have to give away theirs, and its not an indicator of truly following (imitating) Christ. However one cannot serve two Masters.. one cannot serve God and money.. but people are most often just religious.. and have  no love for the REAL God, the Truth, but like to remake  God in their own image...  they are very religious, but their hearts are not for God, but themselves..  There are many other indicators that Jesus was wealthy.. but this few should at least get one thinking... if they want truth that is.. ",

            "answer_text": "Most likely. One of the very few things about the historical Jesus that is highly likely is that he was from Nazareth.  The gospels of Luke and Matthew go to great lengths to \"explain\" how a Galilean from Nazareth could be the Messiah, given that the Messiah was meant to be from Bethlehem in Judah.  They tell contradictory and mutually exclusive stories of his birth to get around the awkward fact that he was from Nazareth, which means this is most likely a historical element about Jesus that they had to get around because it could not be avoided.  gJohn also has people dismissing him as the Messiah for exactly the same reason. Archaeology tells us that Nazareth was a tiny village in the early first century AD - barely more than a handful of families maintaining subsistence-level terraced farming, possibly supplemented with day labouring for other farmers in the area.  This community was small and dirt poor. Those who, oddly, have some kind of problem with idea that Jesus was a peasant try to dangle a lot of argument from the slender thread of a single reference to Jesus being a carpenter.  In the whole New Testament, this is only said of him in one verse: Mark 6:3.  As I note in my comment on Harold Kingsberg's answer to this question, there's some reason to doubt that this actually does mean he was a carpenter.   But some simply take this single reference at face value and then build suppositions on the Greek word \u03c4\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd. They argue that \u03c4\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd can mean craftsman, carpenter or skilled artisan or even architect.  They then select \"architect\" from that range of possibilities and create stories about Jesus and his father working as high status architect-builders in the nearby city of Sepphoris.  This is fiction-writing, not history. While there is a small chance that these speculations are true, the fact that he lived in such a tiny, impoverished village makes it rather more likely that he was a village craftsman, making tools and fixing household items, not a middle class architect who just happened to live in a peasant village. This is supported by much of Jesus' teaching, which focuses on the affliction of the poor, the greed of the rich, the imposition of tax burden and the difficult life of day labourers trying to make a living.  Many of his reported parables and sayings have agricultural settings or use metaphors to do with farming. As with most things about the historical Jesus, the evidence is so meagre and so open to interpretation that it is hard to answer the question and quite easy to construct interpretations that could answer it any number of ways.  But his origin in Nazareth is one of the few likely things about him we can say with any assurance and archaeology of that site alone tells us he was most likely a peasant living in a village of fellow peasants.
