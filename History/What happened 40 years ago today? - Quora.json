As it became richer and the middle class in China grew, they'd become more like us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to believe that yeah that everyone wants to become like us, though become more western, more democratic. In fact, all the opposite occurred. China's human rights violation have gotten worse and worse over the years, whether it's the leaders or religious minorities or their neighbours, the people who enjoy democracy in Hong Kong until just recently, the bullying of Taiwan. So we've seen very malign Chinese activity,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. The theft of intellectual property has gotten so bad that Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI recently called it the greatest wealth transfer in human history was a theft by the Chinese of our intellectual property, he said. \u201cNow, that's not just an abstract concept, okay? That's sweat equity. That's American innovators. That's people that are putting their whole life into dreams. People have invented things in their garages. People who've built companies, who've done everything they can to create an idea and turn an idea into reality. And then what happens? That idea gets stolen by China,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not just that they've lost the economic value of their innovation or of their method of doing business, the Chinese have taken it sometimes using slave labour but using cheaper labour, often manufactured of products that compete at a lower price and then put the original person who invented the technology out of business and then kill the industry from the United States and whole industries go to China. Whole manufacturing plants go to China,\u201d he said. It has been really astounding, O\u2019Brien said. \u201cChristopher Wray also said that the FBI is opening a new espionage case against the Chinese every 10 hours. I mean, escape scope of Chinese activity against the United States is relentless. We've never seen anything like it. There's nothing like this in the Cold War with the Soviets,\u201d he said. President Trump, he said, has stood up to the Chinese. For the first time in 40 years, he put tariffs on the Chinese. \u201cWe had a phase one trade deal that partially addressed some of the unfair trade practices and was a huge step in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as soon as that was signed, we ended up with the president calls at the China plague or the COVID outbreak here, which made that, somewhat irrelevant because of the tremendous losses we suffered, again because the Chinese wouldn't share the virus samples with us early, wouldn't let CDC doctors come into China early to investigate, wouldn't let WHO doctors come into China to investigate, wouldn't restrict travel from China to overseas, especially to Europe when they were restricting travel within China,\u201d he added. However, he asserted that the United States under Trump would prevail against China. \u201cHe is the first president that stood up to the Chinese. I hope he's not going to be the last president who stands up to the Chinese. And as difficult as the problem is, let me tell you, I'm confident in the United States of America. I believe at the end of the day, we are going to prevail. We've got a peace through strength foreign policy finally that we've been missing for some time now,\u201d he said. The United States is investing is defense and us taking strong action on the diplomatic front against the Chinese. \u201cWe're taking strong action on the trade front. We are protecting our intellectual property. We're not going to--you know, we called out the communist Chinese party. We're taking strong action and have massive sanctions on the Chinese for the first time because of the treatment of the Uighurs or their treatment of democrats in Hong Kong,\u201d he asserted. \u201cI think at the end of the day, our allies are going to follow us, what you've seen happening with 5G and Huawei and we're seeing many, many countries, including our closest allies turning away from the Chinese, turning away from Huawei and going with trusted providers on 5G. So I think at the end of the day, America is going to prevail. I think trump president Trump's vision of free markets and free women and freed men is an attractive message not just to our allies but even to people within China,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cSo you know, I'm confident in the future, but I'll tell you, this is a challenge. It's a heck of a challenge, but I'm convinced that under President Trump's leadership, the American people are up to the challenge,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.
