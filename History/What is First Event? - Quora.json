            "answer_text": "I have worked on the First Event organizing committee for 2 years now as the Workshop Coordinator.  First Event provides programming to the entire gender non conforming spectrum including crossdressers, genderqueer, trans* and transitioning (both FTM and MTF), genderqueer, drag queens, mixed gender presentation, intersex, other gender non conforming, couples and partners of people who are gender non conforming as well as those of all ages.   The conference has experienced a 20% growth for the past 3 years.  While I cannot give you an exact number on the statistical break down for people attending, I can tell you that there were in excess of 100 Female to male people this year.  I'm thinking there were possibly twice that number of male to female trans* people.  I would say that about 50 percent of the attendees are crossdressers.  There has been a huge surge of couples attending because we provide support groups for partners.  There is a small percentage of trans* health care providers and mental health counselors who attend the conference to learn more about trans* issues.  Our attendance was probably 600 plus this year.  We are one of the largest and longest running trans* conferences in the country.  Next year (2015) will be the 35th year and we are looking forward to another year of 20% growth. New this year (2014) was the Winter Luau Pool party and the Evening of Elegance.  2014 which was absolutely phenomenal.  2014 had a large focus on Gender 101 type workshops for those newly transitioning as well as many new added genderqueer or multi identity topics which were more non binary in nature.  Most of the activist content was on Friday.  We had new doctors this year and we have more new doctors lined up for next year, although we do have some doctors which come every year as well.  We will be offering a survey soon offering questions to attempt to discover people's workshop ideas for 2015. Our conference is quite unique also in that our audience is quite diverse.  You will see the guys both those who are female to male as well as crossdressers and gay drag queens getting along with those who are male to female.  I've been told that some of  the other conferences are much less diverse. For 2015, the conference will be held at the Waltham Westin hotel.  We expect it to be even bigger and better than the 2014 conference. ",
