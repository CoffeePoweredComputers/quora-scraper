            "answer_text": "I\u2019m tempted to re-cast the question as \u201cWhat does Trump mean by anything?\u201d at this point. More helpfully, Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201cfake\u201d tends to be roughly synonymous with \u201ctells me something I don\u2019t like\u201d. So \u201cfake news\u201d is news which paints Trump and his people in a poor light, \u201cfake polls\u201d are those which suggest that he\u2019s at risk of losing the election in November, and so on. Following that through to its conclusion, \u201cfake history\u201d would be \u201chistory which paints something [more than likely the USA] in a poor light.\u201d It\u2019s what\u2019s sometimes referred to as \u201cblack armband history\u201d in Australia. The idea is that very few countries have a pure and unsullied record of doing good things. Teaching the history of a given country, therefore, involves looking at the good and the bad. The US has some pretty impressive high points in its history, as well as some really low low points, and you can\u2019t simply ignore the latter in favour of the former. Teaching (or, more charitably, focusing too much on) those low points would appear to be what Trump considers \u201cfake history\u201d. ",
