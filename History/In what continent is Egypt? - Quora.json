            "answer_text": "Meet the Suez Canal.  It\u2019s a 193 km (120 miles) long, 25 m (80 ft) deep and 200 metres (675 ft) wide man-made canal between the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. Proposed by Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte in 1799, it was completed in 1869. From that year forward it is considered as the border between Asia and Africa.  Whatever lies to the west the Canal is Africa, whatever lies to the east is Asia. Since the state of Egypt lies to both east and west of the Canal it becomes one of the three trans-continental countries \u2014 Russia, Turkey and Egypt. When Alaska was part of the Russian Empire, that country used to be spread over three continents \u2014 Europe, Asia and America. The African part of Egypt is the Nile Valley. It features the cities of Cairo, Alexandria, Thebes, Memphis\u2026 quite the part of folklore, pop-culture, toruism and historical studies.  The Asian part on the contrary, used to be a desolate desert, inhabited by semi-savage Bedouin tribes and reclusive monks in secretive monasteries. This is the land where Moses got lost and wandered for 40 years with the entire Hebrew nation in tow.  Not very inviting, I must conclude. No wonder people don\u2019t want to live there. While 1,378 people live per km\u00b2 in Alexandria Governorate, only 15 live per km\u00b2 in North Sinai Governorate and 5 people in South Sinai. But, make no mistake. Sinai has been a highly important strategic location ever since the Canal was built. In the 20th century many battles were fought over the Sinai peninsula, including the Battle of Romani (1916), the Battle of Sinai (1948), the Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967), and the Battle of the Sinai (1973).  It also features the Israel-Egypt border (there\u2019s also a Gaza-Egypt border). One of the most guarded borders in the world.  It\u2019s fenced with 245 km long steel barrier that includes cameras, radar, and motion detectors built over three years at a cost of USD 450 million. It was until recently guarded by the Caracal Battalion of IDF, a fighting unit that\u2019s 70% composed of women fighters.  The Asian part of Egypt has the Canal on one side and the Barrier on the other. And, it has very few people in there. Easy for everyone to forget but the generals. The only border post at Taba-Eliat is often closed.  Do not despair. If you are interested, and is not an Israeli citizen, you still can check out the wonderful South Sinai town of Sharm el Sheikh and its gorgeous and competitively priced Red Sea resorts.  \u0623\u0647\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648 \u0633\u0647\u0644\u0627\u064b (Ahlan wa sahlan, lit. welcome)  ",

            "answer_text": "Africa. The history of Egypt, ancient and modern, is African history. Egypt is a Nile-Land first and foremost like 10 other African countries. The Nile is our greatest African river in length and shared history. Egyptians are people of the Nile. They have always been Nilotic people. The FGM, a widespread cultural practice in Egypt, is inherited from Nilotic ancestors. Egypt is a founding member of the African Union (formerly OAU). President al-Sissi is the Chair of the African Union. Egypt is a member state of numerous regional and continental African organizations and initiatives (The Nile Basin Initiative) Ethnic Egyptians carry genetic markers of African origin, either the e1b1b hg or the e1b1a hg. The E macro-haplogroup is African regardless how it sliced e1b1b hg or e1b1a hg. It is considered African admixture outside Africa. There is an obvious link between Egypt and the Great Lakes Region that is hardly mentioned when people talk about Egypt : the Congo-Nile Divide where the Nile and Congo basins intersect. Many Congolese ethnic groups cite Egypt as their ancestral land. An Osiris statuette was found in Congo (Katanga). A set of Egyptian vases were excavated in Congo (Kasai). ",
