            "answer_text": "It is not only possible but essential Countless millions know the reality of it. John 3:7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.It becomes a greater reality than our physical, first birth. It becomes the greatest reality on the life of those born again. We see things through new eyes of understanding, we have access to God\u2019s mind to do God\u2019s business, We receive the kingdom that He delights to give us. Drug addicts become responsible citizensprostitutes become godlythieves become giversthe wicked become holy (Holy means separated unto God, it is more a state of being rather than a behavior - though one behaves as one IS)we go from being self and world-centered to being God and Kingdom centered.Without that new birth heaven is impossible. John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.John 3:6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.Only those of the Spirit can live in the eternal spiritual realm of Heaven. It starts when a person comes in real spiritual contract with God. And we can not make it happen John 1:13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.It is a gift given to those who seek God and truth with all their heart and requires that we admit we are in need of being changed and our life is not as it should be. Even for those who are born again, it is an unexpected experience and has far-reaching changes and benefits. The change in our life manifests itself suddenly and slowly throughout the rest of our lives. It is beyond description and we can only partially describe it, but not really, it is too personal. What many do not tell you is that the flesh (who we are in the natural) is constantly seeking to gain control. The flesh and spirit are always striving for control. Our spiritual nature and aspirations compete against our appetites and our \u201cME-ness\u201d Those who walk in newness of life do not fulfill the lusts of the flesh, but often the flesh does assume temporary supremacy. The struggle is told of in Romans 7. the reality of the new birth and the death that proceeds it, is explained in Romans 6. The mind of man can not comprehend such things. God has deliberately made them seem foolish to the mind of man. Many claim to be born again, but the above things have not happened to them. It is not a religious experience.  It is not contrary to reason or logic, but is far beyond it and reveals a Higher reason and logic It is a supernatural transformation ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah. There\u2019s a thoroughly PRACTICAL reason for this, and pardon me, but everybody who believes in reincarnation should be aware of it. All of a Universe\u2019s sentients have to be eternal beings. It keeps them from blowing the Universe the Hell up. So we\u2019ve shown why we all have to be eternal souls. Well, now, what\u2019s the simplest way to handle all these friggin\u2019 eternally existing souls? Reincarnation. That\u2019s the SIMPLEST solution. And that\u2019s it, the way the Universe works. HAS to work, if it\u2019s going to be a stable Universe. Let me repeat all this in more rigorous fashion. See what you think. The existence of the soul can be demonstrated in two ways. One: Directly, with the construction of a soul-detector and observing a soul leaving a dying body. I have reason to suspect the detection principle will be rapid variation in Planck\u2019s Constant. Two: Indirectly, from a purely theoretical analysis. There are two factors to consider. One: Observation of human behavior and Two: The necessity of keeping a Universe\u2019s sentients from blowing their Universe the Hell up. Until some fuzzy-headed scientist gets around to building a soul-detector, let me lay out the theoretical proof, and you can judge for yourself. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s easy. Absurdly simple. And would you like to live in a world where nobody is afraid to die? Where you personally are no longer afraid to die? It\u2019s only a single experiment away. Oh, by the way, the eventual result of the scientific confirmation of the existence of souls will be the complete and total destruction of all evil on Earth. See my story at the end.) Life after death is real, the cold-sober scientific truth, the way the Universe works. Life after death is not a fiction or a fantasy. It is real, something vitally necessary in order for the Universe to be stable, mainly to keep the Universe\u2019s sentients from blowing the Universe the Hell up. On this one thing, the existence of the soul, those silly religious woo-woos are ABSOLUTELY right. Those moonbeam-dancing, ley-line-loving, crystal-worshiping, long-haired-hippie-freak woo-woos are totally dead-bang right. I can prove ALL of this---if you are smart enough to understand it. (Although intelligence really isn\u2019t the main problem, but rather the ability to think clearly and objectively. THAT is rare, even among scientists. THIS IS AN EASY PROBLEM TO SOLVE. Considered simply as an exercise in logic, the problem of the existence of the soul is entirely trivial.) I can prove it all by the best, most rigorous method the human race has ever found for finding the truth. The scientific method. Observation, hypothesis, and finally confirmation by testing in the lab. By building a soul-detector and detecting souls in the lab. The detecting principle, I suspect, will be rapid changes in Planck\u2019s Constant. You don\u2019t even have to use people. You can use cats. Why cats? Cat-soul dived through my chest once. Also, soul theory indicates the source of emotion is the soul, not the brain, and therefore any animal that shows emotion, in particular love, is an eternal being and has a soul. The observation and hypothesis parts I have solved. I\u2019d get the third one too, if I had the money. Alas, I don\u2019t. It would take a million bucks just to start. I continue to hope some bad-boy millionaire scientist or engineer will trip over my Quora answers one day. (You hearing this, Elon? Would you like to smash the whole damn world? I can show you how.) Let me give you the short version, then the long version. Rigorously objective analysis of human behavior reveals human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence, on quite a number of levels. Since human bodies are certainly not eternal, human beings MUST contain an eternally existing component, i.e. they must have souls. You might object something as weird as souls could only exist if the Universe had some EXTREMELY powerful need for them. You would be correct. There actually is an extremely powerful need for a Universe\u2019s sentients to ALL be eternal beings who have souls. It inhibits the sentients from destroying their Universe. If a Universe\u2019s sentients are NOT eternal beings, then the Universe logically becomes Hell. Because most sentients\u2019 lives are composed mostly of pain, and unless their existence was without limit, their pain, and their lives, would be completely meaningless. Live in Hell, and then die. Sentients would destroy any such Universe in a cosmic heartbeat. It would be the MORAL thing to do. And oh my, yes, all sentients possess the theoretical capacity to destroy the entire Universe, as one aspect of sentients is knowledge of how the Universe works, as in the ability to write down the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws and then use those laws to change the Universe around them as they see fit. Stephen Hawking embodies the entire situation perfectly. If anybody understands the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws, it is Stephen Hawking. If anybody has suffered at the hands of the Universe, it is Stephen Hawking. And waddya know, Stephen Hawking has found a way to destroy the whole damn Universe. With a flick of his little finger. He has pointed out the Higgs field exists in an excited state, and that the existence of all the Universe\u2019s particles depend on the Higgs field remaining in that excited state. So, because the Higgs field exists in an excited state, the Universe contains a fundamental instability which can be used to destroy it. If the Higgs field ever drops to its ground state in any particular area, all the Universe\u2019s particles in that area will promptly disintegrate. And from that area the drop in energy (and therefore disintegration) will spread, exactly like dropping a spark into gunpowder. And the entire Universe dissolves back into the Chaos it came from. So all we have to do is build a machine that will catalyze the drop of the Higgs field to its ground state. We will only have to use it once. We punch the button\u2014-and poof, no more Universe, at the speed of light. Remember, if we all are not eternal beings, we all live in Hell, and this is the moral thing to do. The odds are pretty good the human race is NOT the first sentient species to evolve in the Universe, but no sentient species has ever actually done this. The Universe is still there. I hereby conclude this Universe\u2019s sentients are eternal beings, and there is a way to detect souls in the laboratory. That\u2019s the short version. Now the long version. Here is an essay which explores this Universe-destruction thing further. This is the rock-bottom of it all. It\u2019s ALL about keeping the Universe in one piece, man. ON THE SENTIENT CONSTRAINTS OF A SENTIENT-CONTAINING UNIVERSE http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-sentient-constraints-of-sentient.html Now an exploration of the various ways human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence. (This is by no means all the ways.) If human beings possess immortal souls, it should be possibly to logically deduce this by objective analysis of their actions. It should be possible to show in your own personal actions. It should be possible to show you ACT like you have a soul, even when you think you don\u2019t. THE MURDER ON A BEACH THOUGHT EXPERIMENT http://theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/12/murder-on-beach-thought-experiment-on.html It should be possible to demonstrate the rule exists in collective action. It should be possible to demonstrate the assumption of eternal existence exists in the foundation rules of the world\u2019s stable societies, although they may not be aware of it. ON EMOTION DRUGS http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-emotion-drugs.html The physical purpose of souls is stability. So it should be possible to demonstrate denying or removing the assumption of eternal existence results in extreme personal pain and extremely violent instability. AND NOTHING HEARD MY SCREAM http://theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/05/and-nothing-heard-my-scream.html The reincarnation thing. I observe fiction is reincarnation. A RATIONALIST LOOKS AT REINCARNATION People wonder what happens to them when they die. They do it every time they turn the TV on or watch a movie. I laugh. And now one last stinger. This is for the REALLY smart people out there. The existence of souls is currently perceived as mostly an academic debate. Something that won\u2019t make much difference one way or the other. It is not. The confirmation of the existence of souls will cause the most profound change in human behavior there has ever been. This will be a scientific discovery that will cause a change in humanity\u2019s MORAL behavior, as people will finally understand it is impossible to escape the consequences of your actions. Let me illustrate this with a story. A scientist builds a soul-detector, IMMEDIATELY detects souls\u2014-and smashes the entire world. The total and permanent destruction of all evil on Earth begins as the good guys are finally cut loose. Because science has now proven the MORAL thing to do is also the SMART thing to do. AFTER THE AWAKENING https://futurism.media/after-the-awakening This story is the future, what\u2019s about to happen, right around the corner. The Awakening is coming.
