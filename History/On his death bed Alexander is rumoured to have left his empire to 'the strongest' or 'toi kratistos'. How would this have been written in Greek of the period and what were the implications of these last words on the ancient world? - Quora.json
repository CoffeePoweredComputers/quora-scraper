How would this have been written in Greek of the period? as following \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1ff3 - To the strongest/best  and what were the implications of these last words on the ancient world? To begin with, according to general Craterus, Alexander said \u201cto Kratero\u201d instead of \u201cto kratisto\u201d, thus claimed that Alexander chose him as his successor (\u201cTo Craterus\u201d), his claim was however dismissed.

Some saw it as a mockery or foreshadowing of their future squabblings and wars that would destroy Alexander\u2019s own creation. Others understood it as Alexander\u2019s revenge to his generals, who halted his advance in India, made him return back and perhaps poisoned him to get their share of glory, power and wealth. Finally, some interpreted it an act of arrogance by Alexander, that no one were to succeed him, build upon his legacy, live similar glory and achievements, as that phrase or should i say command would certainly lead the successors to war, division and utter destruction.  Perseus, the last king of Macedonia, paraded through the streets of Rome defeated  Cleopatra VII, the last Queen of Ptolemaic Egypt and the last of the successors, commiting suicide ",
