(Sorry if this story offends the puritans amongst us who will complain that I am not addressing the precise question, but a tail gunner was brought up and this tail gunner\u2019s story deserves to be told. So, to those who complain \u2013 get over it and move on with your lives. On the night of 24 March 1944, 21-year-old Flight Sergeant Nicholas Alkemade was a tail gunner and one of seven crew members in a Royal Air Force Avro Lancaster bomber returning from a bombing raid on Berlin. His aircraft was attacked by a German night fighter, caught fire and began to spiral out of control. Because his parachute had gone up in flames, it was unserviceable. Alkemade decided to jump from the aircraft without it, preferring to die by impact rather than burn to death. He fell 18,000 feet to the ground below. His fall was broken by pine trees and a soft snow cover on the ground. He suffered only a sprained leg. The Lancaster crashed in flames, killing the pilot and three other crew members. Alkemade was subsequently captured and interviewed by the Gestapo, who were initially suspicious of his claim to have fallen without a parachute. But when the wreckage of the aircraft was found and examined his captors reportedly gave him a certificate testifying to the fact. He was a celebrated POW, before being repatriated in May 1945. Now there is one bad-ass tail gunner! ",
