            "answer_text": "It\u2019s difficult to say. There probably are elements of that, even in Polybius, who is considered a very reliable historian. For example, the story of his father forcing him to swear eternal enmity to Rome. That\u2019s a very novelistic way to set up a story. The story of how they got elephants to cross the Rhone River on floating platforms seems dubious also. In fact elephants can swim well. But probably Polybius had no way of knowing that and needed to make something up. The story of the soldiers exploding a rock in the Alps. First of all, if this was a known pass, how could there be an obstacle in it that wasn\u2019t taken care of long before? Second, how would Polybius come to learn such an obscure bit of information. The pre-battle conference at Zama makes for great reading, but seems dubious too. Would those two really have gotten along so well? Remember that Hannibal was responsible for the death of Scipio\u2019s father. ",
