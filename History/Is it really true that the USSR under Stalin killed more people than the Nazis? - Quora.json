            "answer_text": "Impossible to say. While the role of Nazis in devastations during WWII is thoroughly researched, the most important archives detailing Soviet history of the time remain unavailable to historians. Consider this: Right before WWII, the USSR had a population census that was openly doctored. It could be an attempt to cover up casualties of the collectivization and the Great Purge in the 1930s. Stalin might be using the devastation of WWII to cover up these losses. No attempts to recover the initial records of the \u201939 census have been made.Both the Nazis and the Red Army extensively used scorched earth policy and indiscriminate bombing of civil areas. No attempts were made to investigate the exact scale and consequences of this. The Nuremberg Processes squarely put all blame on the Nazis.In addition, you have an issue of attributing blame for general misery. Would everyone agree that people who died of starvation on the Soviet-controlled territory during WWII and right after it in 1946\u20131947 (between 1 and 2 million, at least), were killed by Stalin?

None the less, in recent years I come to question in great detail how the USSR could have rivaled America even after being destroyed twice over. In the span of one Generation. I've also noticed how in some circles your not suppose to bring that up. Dima Vorobiev will likely have the clearest answer to this question. ",
