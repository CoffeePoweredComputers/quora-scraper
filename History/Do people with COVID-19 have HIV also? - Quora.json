            "answer_text": "No. Completely unrelated. But some people that do have HIV can still get coronavirus. The body's immune system can defeat coronavirus within 2 months if they can be kept alive. But a person with HIV will carry the virus for the rest of their life. It may take a year before HIV causes problems. A person with coronavirus may become sick between one or two weeks after infection. Many people will have few or no symptoms of coronavirus. Over 90% of people survive. Everyone with AIDS will die. Mainly from the infection unless they die in some other event. The coronavirus and HIV come from very different regions. HIV most likely comes from primates in Africa. Coronavirus may come from bats in China. HIV/AIDS kills hundreds of thousands of people each year. It is a very slow but deadly disease. Most deaths are in Africa. It is likely that coronavirus will have mostly died out in 2 years' time. For a number of reasons. There are still many things we do not know about these 2 viruses. Despite intensive research. ",

The former has spread across a wide enough swathe of the global population that it\u2019s sure to have infected at least one person who has the latter. That said, a lot of people with HIV know that they\u2019re immunocompromised as it is, so they may be more likely to have self-isolated where possible. It would be the developing world where that may not be the case. If the meaning of the question is \u201cDoes being infected by covid-19 cause someone to be infected with HIV as well?\u201d, though, the answer is no. They\u2019re two separate viruses. ",
