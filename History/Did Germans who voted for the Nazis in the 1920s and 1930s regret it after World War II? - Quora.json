Some Germans who voted for the Nazis in elections that culminated in a Nazi plurality in the Reichstag and thus Hitler\u2019s appointment as Chancellor never regretted their votes, because they died in the war, whether in the military or in the bombings of German cities. Others clearly were later regretful, given the vast destruction brought upon their country by the war Hitler instigated. Some, from what has come to light, never did, and there are neo-Nazis who still support Hitler\u2019s ideas in Germany today\u2014a small number, but given the lessons of history a more astonishing phenomenon, if one thinks about it, than the existence of such hateful ideology in small numbers of Americans.
