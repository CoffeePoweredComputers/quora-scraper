            "answer_text": "Question: To what degree did the Vietnamese people support the Viet Cong? Answer: Well, I think that most of the Vietnamese in South Vietnam supported the Viet Cong.  (Ben Tre, one of the VC base during the Vietnam War against the baby killer[1] forces - American troops) Firstly, According to the American source, about 80%[2] of the South Vietnamese would have voted for Mr. Ho and his force - VC if a free election were held relating to the Geneva accord 1954[3] .  Secondly, the Source of North Vietnam is very limited, so, they could not provide for VC in South Vietnam as Americans did to its puppet regime - South Vietnam. It means that VC must base on the Vietnamese civilian's support. If not, VC could not fight even only some days during the Vietnam War. So, America would love to kill the Vietnamese civilians and report them as VC like the My Lai massacre[4] and 43[5] massacres committed by the South Korean troops.  Thirdly, Among three choice to support during the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese had America, South Vietnam regime and North Vietnam/VC. Here are the people who supported American troops in Vietnam.  (Happy house for America) Most of the Vietnamese follow Buddhism and you see most of them oppose the South Vietnam.  (the Buddhist crisis 1963[6] and a monk burnt himself to oppose the South Vietnam regime) In conclusion: I think that most of the Vietnamese supported VC and North Vietnam. It explains Why America and the American allies often tried to kill the Vietnamese civilians and report them as VC. P/s: I write answers based upon the gist and requirement of the question. Readers are requested to read it with neutrality and rational approach. I throughout this answer has no intention of showing any disrespect towards any group of people or country.

            "answer_text": "The problem was the Viet Cong were Communist, first, using Nationalist rhetoric to sell their backing. Using fear, intimidation, forced conscription, and constant execution of South Vietnamese government appointed to village leadership. Our infantry unit,along with other units, were often called in after the local village or hamlet chief and his family had been executed but the VC. Their bodies were hung or heads placed on stakes as a warning to others for supporting Saigon. See, when the French withdrew in 1954, the Viet Minh purged its ranks of non-Communist supporters, mostly through executions. Diem, who would go onto become President, lost his brother, an non-Communist Viet Minh who was one of those Nationalist murdered by the Communist elements as they consolidated power. About 40,000 communist soldiers infiltrated the South in 1961\u201363. The Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng grew rapidly; an estimated 300,000 members were enrolled in \"liberation associations\" (affiliated groups) by early 1962. The problem was the VC attrition rate due to desertion (an effective Hoi Chanh program), battle deaths, normal jungle rated diseases meant they had to constantly conscript youth in villages before they were drafted to serve in the ARVN. They were eligible for governmental draft at 18 so the VC would often conscript them at 16 an 17. I met a Hoi Chanh or Chieu Hoi who was one of our scouts. He had been drafted or kidnapped into the VC at age 16. He deserted and joined the Hoi Chahn program as a trained Kit Carson at age 20. The Communist would tell you that all Southerners wanted to be united under the Communist umbrella. That is an out right lie. That is why they fought so hard to protect their freedom from Communism from the 1950's to 1975. Then the Communist would say if it wasn't for the US, the South would has easily embraced the totalitarian one-party system the Communist provided but they ignored the fact that South Vietnam kept fighting to protect that freedom two years after American troops had been withdrawn. Then the Communists would say they were freeing the South from a corrupt government in Saigon. Here it is 5 decades later and Vietnam still is recognized as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Can't blame that on the South Vietnamese government anymore. Did the villages support the VC\u2026yes or die. ",
