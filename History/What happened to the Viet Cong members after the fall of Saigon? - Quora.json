            "answer_text": "Question: What happened to the Viet Cong members after the fall of Saigon? Answer: Firstly, Well, I think that most of them continued to fight in the Cambodian- Vietnam conflicts from 1975 to 1989. A part of them had to come back home because they were over age for military services.  (Southern Vietnam in the Mekong Delta) Secondly, Many people often made a mistake when trying to divide VC and NVA (North Vietnam). Basically, VC could be considered as the local forces of NVA.  In conclusion: VC are heroes of the Vietnamese who fought for freedom and independence of Vietnam against the American imperialists. P/s: I write answers based upon the gist and requirement of the question. Readers are requested to read it with neutrality and rational approach. I throughout this answer has no intention of showing any disrespect towards any group of people or country. Best wishes. Lusia Millar. ",
