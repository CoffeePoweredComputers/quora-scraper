            "answer_text": "Anthropology can definitely be problematic and it has a repugnant history too from the Victorian era and earlier when it was fixated on race, evolutionary differences and \u2018social Darwinism\u2019. This past still casts a strong shadow today. It had an absolutely devastating impact on past people. Its a difficult topic but one that should be understood and learned from by anyone in the anthropological sciences. Antiquarian racial anthropology: this continued until the second world war and began with racial division of the human species into groups considered to be at different stages of evolution. It developed into eugenics. The concept of race is now scientifically debunked but the culture and social impact of this period of \u2018science\u2019 still perpetuates. White Europeans were seen as the most evolved humans on the planet, leading to the most horrific global atrocities hiustory has ever seen.Chauvanism: this has perpetuated throughout anthropology\u2019s history and began in Victorian Times as the extreme idea that only males had evolved, due to the idea that females had always been sheltered from forces of natural selection by men. Even in the 1980s it was continuing, with a paper coming out that suggested that males began walking before females, because males were hunting and all females were doing was sitting at homebases being provided for. In addition, males have opn average, larger brains, which has led to chauvanism. In fact, when set against differences in body size, there isn\u2019t a brain size difference. Even now anthropology still presents females as emotional and caring and males as cold and systemising. I frequently encounter people in the field who still are absolutely adamant that females struggle with mathematics and science.Seeing modern day hunter-gatherers as regressive: sometimes referred to as \u2018Stone Age People\u2019, hunter-gatherers are studied extensively as windows into the human past. I have seen modern anthropologies make analogies between the San Bush people and Homo erectus. Today\u2019s hunter-gatherers are modern people with modern technologies, who simply have followed a different technological pathway. Recording the wide variety of stratregies humans use today when they rely completely on wild resources can be useful in creating a picture of how diverse culture is and what Homo sapiens are capable of achieving but there is \u2018no window on the past\u2019 and such cultures are not primitive.Processualism: processualism investigates systems of actions that humans can be predicted to display in set environments. This systems can be very strict and Lewis Binford was a big name in this area. He would create flow charts to predict exactly how a hunter gatherer group would organise themselves spatially, culturally and socially according to their surroundings. Often economics was the priority. In fact, human societies often don\u2019t make sense and individuals in those societies display individual agency. they break rules, they fast, they create taboos and they can act illogically. Processualism limits the perception of the human condition. It also always had a tendency towards prime age male action, making children, women, the disabled and elders completely invisible.Anthropology is very useful but must be done carefully, and with intersectional awareness and with great self awareness too. We must be careful what narratives we create and be aware of where those narratives come from, and be careful that the practise of anthropology does not perpetuate privilege, racism, sexism, and all forms of discrimination and inequality in society.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sorry, your question makes as little sense to me as asking, \u201cWhat are the disadvantages of biology?\u201d Anthropology is a field of study, whose subject is humankind in all its aspects. Its various sub-fields focus on various aspects of the human experience. It\u2019s also a methodological approach, an evolving one to be sure, but distinct in that regard from related fields such as sociology, cultural geography, philology, history, and so forth. So, what exactly do you mean? Are you asking whether the subject matter of anthropology is worth studying? Of course it is, if you happen to be human. Are you asking whether the methodology of the anthropological approach is superior or inferior in some respect to the approach taken by related fields? Well, now we may be getting someplace, but it\u2019s still hard to frame a specific answer unless you frame a more specific question. What is the particular subject under study, and what is the related field whose method you want to compare and contrast with the anthropological method? Go ahead and ask again with those points in mind, and we\u2019ll try to answer again. ",
