            "answer_text": "Mostly in the 1600\u2019s. \u201cThou\u201d didst barely make it to the American shores. The time around the English Revolution (1640\u20131660) was a period of great turmoil in all things cultural, religious, political, scientific\u2026 and it\u2019s largely in this period that thee and thou didst fell into disuse, and other aspects of didst simplify themselves. Among the religious dissidents (including Separatists, Puritans, and Quakers) there was opposition to the distinction between informal vs. polite use, thou\u201d vs. \u201cye\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d especially as it required common people to address their superiors (lords and kings) using the formal \u201cyou.\u201d As also in French, where the polite \u201cvous\u201d is grammatically the second person plural, used as formal second person singular, \u201cyou\u201d was grammatically the 2nd person plural. (Did you catch me saying \u2018you was\u2019?). The dissidents preferred to address everyone without respect to social class. The easy path was to raise everybody in status, calling everyone \u2018you\u2019, and that is the common usage today. The Quakers chose the opposite path, insisting on addressing any individual, regardless of status as \u2018thou\u2019 or \u2018thee.\u2019 In later times, though, the Quakers dropped the nominative/objective distinction between \u2018thou\u2019 and \u2018thee\u2019, and came to use \u2018thee\u2019 in nominative. Backing up a bit as to \u201cye\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d \u2014 in Middle English the 2nd person plural was generally \u201cye\u201d in the nominative case and \u201ceow\u201d or \u201cgu\u201d in objective case. So, trending into the Early Modern English of Shakespeare or King James, those were \u201cye\u201d as nominative, \u201cyou\u201d as objective. But the same way as the Quakers dropped the nominative form \u201cthou\u201d and collapsed it with \u201cthee\u201d to be the all purpose 2nd person, in common usage the nominative \u201cye\u201d was dropped and \u201cyou\u201d took its place for all things. Now, about \u201cye\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d, that\u2019s a different story, and a matter of orthography, not pronunciation. \u201cYe Olde Shoppe\u201d would have been pronounced \u201cthe old shop\u201d just as today, but \u2018Y\u2019 or something like it (left over from the old English letter \u2018thorn\u2019) was used by printers and scribes as a symbol for the \u2018th\u2019 sound. Others can go further into the weeds on that topic. ",

            "answer_text": "The pronouns for the second person singular, thou, and the second person plural, ye, are found in Old English and are still well-recorded into the 17th century (with some appearances after that). They reflect a period when, as still found in for instance the French tu and vous, different words were used when speaking to one or to several persons. At the same time you, which could be used for both singular and plural, can be seen in this sense from 1400 (there are several older, non-pronoun uses) and is used regularly from the 16th century onwards. Looking at the examples on offer in the OED, it is difficult to see a precise moment at which the all-purpose you replaces thou and ye. However it can be said with some certainty that it was pretty much in place by the 19th century and that if the latter pair do appear today, it will only be in an archaic, literary or poetical context.  For the subsidiary and much wider ranging question, I would recommend a couple of titles: AC Baugh and T Cable A History of the English Language which is an accessible and regularly revised (most recent edition 2002) take on the subject, and Henry Hitchings The Language Wars (2010) which deals with the whole concept of 'proper' English and its development since the Middle Ages. There are doubtless many, many more. ",

So do some other Northern dialects. \u2018You' is the polite form of the second person pronoun. \u2018Thee' is the familiar. This may confuse people mostly familiar with the words from Shakespeare or in a religious context - the hymn How great thou art, the line \u2018Hallowed be thy name\u2019 from the KJV Lord's Prayer. Shakespeare may seem highbrow today, but he wrote in the language of the people. And if you're not familiar with God, what sort of a Christian are you? He seems familiar with you. Yorkshire folk use \u2018you\u2019 for strangers and acquaintances, or when we're speaking \u2018nicely'. For friends and neighbours people will often still use \u2018thee\u2019. Tha thees them as thees thee, as we say: you use \u2018thee\u2019 with the people who use \u2018thee\u2019 with you. It sounds much better in Yorkshire dialect. ",
