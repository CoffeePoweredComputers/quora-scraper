Wiles corrected the error and a revised proof was published in 1995. Calling it a \u201cmistake\u201d is not really fair. It was more that one part of it was incompletely proved. Wiles\u2019s proof ran to 150 pages and presented a wealth of new techniques and proofs for related conjectures; it wasn\u2019t as he he forgot to carry a 1. It wasn\u2019t really controversial, though Wiles found it professionally embarrassing. ",

            "answer_text": "Most controversies in maths arise not because a mistake was missed, but because obvious truths, in retrospect anyway, haven't been recognised. Years, sometimes centuries later, mathematicians have to rebuild a lot of mathematics, and many of them are quite dogmatic. A famous example is the mathematical revolution of the early 20th century. There have to be examples of what you asked about as well, but I can't come up with any. ",
