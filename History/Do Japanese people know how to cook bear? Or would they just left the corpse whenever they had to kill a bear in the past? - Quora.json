            "answer_text": "Like so many other animals, parts of a bear are palatable or edible, others aren't, and yet a third set of parts is useful, but not for eating. I come from Hokkaid\u014d, where the indigenous Ainu used bear meat as a regular part of their diet. So in regard to killing a bear and just leaving it for carrion, no, that would be the height of avoidable waste. In 21st century Japan, we would say \"Mottainai!!\" I'm not familiar with all the different cuts of bear meat, but here are the two parts that modern bear hunters (still active in northern Honsh\u016b and Hokkaid\u014d) most prize. The back paws, once fur is removed and thoroughly cleaned, are a welcome addition to kuma nabe, \"communal bear stew.\" Once well boiled, the meat falls from the tendons and flavors the soup. But the tendons are rich in collagen, and (I understand) are quite delicious. The other sought-after bear part is its liver. Applied externally much as a rare steak over a black eye, dried bear liver is reputed to be an excellent remedy for rheumatism, arthritis, and other joint problems. I've heard rumors that some bear hunters make a living just from selling bear liver, but these may be nothing more than rumors. ",
