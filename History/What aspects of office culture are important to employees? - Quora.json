            "answer_text": "Having worked for large corporations (>10,000 employees), as well as small offices (<100 employees); I can say that there are some parallels with office culture. Navigating any environment successfully means observing each of the following areas and responding appropriately. Office culture includes: 1) the relationship to hard work - some workers like to burn midnight oil, take work home with them and think that will get them somewhere. Others slack or try to get by with the minimum. They only do exactly what their job description lists. The trick is to find a good balance. I wouldn't make it a regular practice to take work home. Definitely reconsider employment where you are forced to - just to keep up with your job. The workload should be challenging, but not impossible. There should be some sense of teamwork, too. Delegation is fine, unless it is done to try to have others do their work. Everyone should be doing their share, and hopefully people get along. It will never be \"rainbows and glitter\" but you should have a few coworkers you enjoy working with.  2) the relationship with complaints - the office should be collectively concerned with customer concerns. There should also be concerns for problems in the office. A good manager will be aware of and deal with conflict before it grows. A good manager keeps discussions generic in public, and should not single out anyone for something negative. Addressing worker weaknesses or strategizing through problems should be done privately. If you are berated, belittled, insulted or experience bullying from coworkers or management on a regular basis, I would start with the chain of command and work up to get it addressed. A dangerous risk, here, is jumping the line of authority. It will likely end badly for you. The manager above you, even if guilty of behavior, will never likely recover and you will never be seen as a candidate for positive change. They will likely make your life difficult, or may be indifferent at best. Some office environments are toxic to begin with. Some change for the worse over time.  High turn-over rates, constant complaining by everyone all of the time, and the big sign: people reading the classified ads during lunch and breaks.  3) office gossip - this is potentially dangerous. Do not have an opinion about any current drama, esp. Those that sound like you are to pick sides.  You can express empathy for the struggle of others, but don'tGet pulled into any drama. You might privately mention to your immediate manager, just so they are aware - and, only if, you think it could affect productivity. Don't go into any details. Then drop it. Oftentimes, these can unfold and escalate into big, emotional messes. The subsequent blow-up in the office could end up with management pulling everyone into the office privately for a fact-finding mission. Again, dangerous, if your name is associated with it. Staying out of it will make your life easier. ",

            "answer_text": "Why don\u2019t you come up with a story that is appealing to everyone in your corporation first? Make sure that most of the key people believe in that and have shared understanding regarding that story. If this is done then you can be sure that foundation for a set of beliefs is in place which is essentially a corporate culture. A good corporate culture is a set of beliefs and norms that ensures effective operation of the company to deliver the expected results. the second important ingredient of your corporate culture will be your staff. There is a principle of \u2018bus\u2019 according to which right people should get the right places in your \u2018bus\u2019. while wrong people should leave. Personally I believe this is a very important strategy to ensure effective operation. In order to be able to recognise the right people you need to have the right criteria and those criteria may often be not the ones you like. You need to work on that to know which criteria you need for your corporate culture. Once you know what kind of people you need and how to recognize them you can make sure that people got the right places in your \u2018bus\u2019. Again a set of beliefs and norms that conducive to an effective operation designed to ensure the needed results is the good corporate culture. A discouraging thing is that it takes a lot of time to develop such culture, but efforts worth of doing it. ",
