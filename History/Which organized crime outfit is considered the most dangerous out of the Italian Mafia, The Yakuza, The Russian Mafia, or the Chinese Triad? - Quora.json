            "answer_text": "How do you define \u201cdangerous\u201d in respect to these organizations? If you cheat or steal from any of them you had better be very savvy yourself if you hope to survive. All of these organizations are engaged in certain activities, illegal or quasi-legal. If you wind up owing them money you can find yourself in very precarious circumstance. If you have no dealings with them at all none of them are likely to bother you. For the most part they do not solicit business from those who do not openly seek them out. None of them, however, are above using murder to deal with a difficult client. I would suggest in terms of danger to American citizens, the various drug cartels of Mexico, Central and South America pose the greatest physical danger to people who neither use their products nor engage with them in any manner. These criminal organizations are better armed than the Mexican Government or most US city police forces, perhaps better armed than the National Guard. When a problem occurs for them regarding theft of product or any similar issue they are capable of invading US cities with tanks and armored vehicles and committing murder or kidnapping to resolve their complaints. Unlike the Mafia, Yakuza, Russian Mob or the old Triads, there is a political agenda, often overlooked, with the Cartels. These people have not really begun to show their true intent or the measure of their actual power. ",
