            "answer_text": " The Levites were the tribe of Israelites descended from Levi, one of the twelve sons of Jacob. The priests of Israel were a group of qualified men from within the tribe of the Levites who had responsibility over aspects of tabernacle or temple worship. All priests were to be Levites, according to the Law, but not all Levites were priests. Priests existed prior to the Levites in a general sense. For example, we first see the role of a priest in Genesis 14:18 during Abraham\u2019s time, long before Levi was born. Melchizedek was the king of the town of Salem, which later became Jerusalem. Melchizedek was also said to be \u201ca priest forever\u201d (Psalm 110:4; cf. Hebrews 6:20; 7:17). Pagan nations also had priests for their religious activities. Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, was the priest of Midian (Exodus 3:1; 18:1). When the Jews received the Law of Moses at Sinai, the Lord gave commands regarding a formal priesthood for Israel. The priests would be males from the tribe of Levi and must meet certain physical and age qualifications in order to serve. In addition, they had to remain ceremonially clean to perform their duties before a holy God. The priests served as mediators between the Israelites and God. They were the ones who performed animal sacrifices on behalf of the people. It was only the priests who were permitted to enter the Holy Place in the tabernacle and, later, the temple. Among these Levitical priests was the high priest. The first high priest was Aaron, the brother of Moses. His sons and their descendants were to serve as the future high priests of the nation of Israel (Exodus 29). Only the high priest was permitted to enter the Most Holy Place in the tabernacle and temple, and that only once per year on the Day of Atonement. Ezra, one of the leaders of the Jews who returned from Babylon, was a Levitical priest (Nehemiah 12:1). Zechariah and Elizabeth, John the Baptist\u2019s parents, were both Levites descended from Aaron (Luke 1:5). Zechariah was a priest, but his son, John, also a Levite, was a prophet, not a priest. By the time of Jesus\u2019 earthly ministry, the Jewish priesthood held much spiritual and political power. In fact, the Jewish chief priests were involved in sentencing Jesus to death. Following the resurrection of Jesus, believers now live under a new covenant in which all Christians are priests: \u201cBut ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light\u201d 1 Peter 2:9 We no longer need an earthly mediator between us and God because Jesus has made the final sacrifice on our behalf and acts as our Mediator (Hebrews 10:19\u201323; 1 Timothy 2:5). The Jewish role of high priest is now fulfilled by Jesus, who serves as our high priest. Jesus\u2019 sacrifice ended our need for continued sacrifices. The Holy Spirit guides and counsels us. The Levitical priesthood was part of the old covenant system of sacrifices. It has been fulfilled in Jesus, and we are now under the new covenant. There is no longer a biblical mandate for priests. Every follower of Christ has access to God, regardless of gender, race, or tribe (Hebrews 7:11\u201328; Ephesians 3:11\u201312; Colossians 3:11). ",

            "answer_text": "From the earliest times of biblical history people worshipped Jehovah God in one way or another. Cain and Abel practiced a form of worship outside of Eden, the one in an unacceptable manner, the other in a way that pleased our Creator. In so doing they would have been viewed as being priests in some way, although not formally labelled as being such. As the population grew it seems that family heads, the patriarchs, took the lead in establishing the form of worship practiced among the members of different families. Noah is an example of one such patriarch. He took the lead in his family and he was later described described by the apostle Peter as a preacher of righteousness. (2 Peter 2: 5) After the flood we had Melchizadek who was a king and priest in Salem. Tradition states that Shem was this same man. His life overlapped that of Abraham by about 150 years. Abraham was a direct descendant of Shem\u2019s, and he performed a similar function in his own family, as did his own offspring, Isaac and Jacob. Jacobs 12 sons then later developed into what became the nation of Israel, and it appears that during the ensuing 400 and more years from Abrahams time down to the Exodus from Egypt, each family head took the lead in being the spiritual head of his own family. It was these family heads who motivated the preservation of family histories and records, whether oral or written, and it is possible that at least some of what Moses was later inspired to record in his writings came from these earlier family histories. So, all the way down through the centuries, there existed a form of an informal priesthood among the Jews. It kept them united. It kept them separate from other nations overall. ",

Sumerians Abram & Sarai of 1800BC begin the existence of the 12 tribes with their son Isaac; his son Jacob; his 12 sons; their 12 tribes. - Consider that the number 12 is a Canaanite numerical symbol in an illiterate society meaning \u2018balance\u2019, having naught to do with history or reality.- Abram would pay his tithe to Priest King Melchizedek in hamlet Shalim worshipping the Canaanite version of anthropomorphic theism, as the only version in the Levant since 2315BC, which they adopted from Sumerians, eons earlier.They would adapt Canaanite names of their 71 Canaanite Gods; EL & 70 Elohim sibling Gods. The 12 tribes would remain nomadic wandering in regions Samaria & Judea from 1800BC, including Abram & Sarai on up, until nomadic Chief David settling in Canaanite village Hebron in 1018BC, removing to Canaanite village Shalim in 1011BC, establishing a Chiefdom of Shalim with 12 tribes until a schism in 933BC sees ten tribes leave for village Shechem in Samaria. From Priest King Melchizedek 1800BC in Shalim to Canaanite Priest Ezra in 456BC in Jerusalem, they worshipped the only existing Canaanite version of anthropomorphic theism & the Canaanite Priests. I repeat, the Judaic version out of the Canaanite version comes to fruition under Priest Ezra in 456BC,albeit retaining a Canaanite Elohe sibling God Yahweh,known to them, only under the tetragrammaton YHWH up, until today, rightfully denying the Canaanite God name Yahweh,as they are not Canaanites, only ever accepting YHWH. This tetragrammaton was used already in 796BC by Prophet Elijah, with the curiously compounded name of two Canaanite Gods, El as in Eli & Yahweh, as in Jah, within the Kingdom of Israel of wicked King Aham & his Philistine wife Jezebel,with an Hebraic name; \u201cLooking for a Prince\u201d. It became known as the \u201cJahwist Cult\u201d. There is no name FOR or OF an Hebraic God. The Sumerians made God in \u2018our\u2019 image; an anthropomorphic God. All (Abramic) versions,Canaanite, Akkad, Judaic, Christianity & Islam worshipped, conceptually at the altar of the Sumerian original. ",
