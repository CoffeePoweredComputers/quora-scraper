            "answer_text": "Well they did have some stuff. Their first contact with the sea came when Akbar conquered Gujarat. He set up a naval division there. Its also written about in Ain-i-Akbari. But navy remained weak and small. After the conquest of Bengal, an eastern arm was set up too. This arm was better equipped than the western arm. The only notable naval expedition done by the Mughals was against a king in Myanmar, where Shaistekhan (Aurangzeb\u2019s uncle) led 200 ships as well as a cavalry force by land. It ended up a big victory. But overall, the navy was incredibly weak and pitiful. On various occasions, the Mughal ships were ransomed and humiliated by the British - a small power by then - and others. On the western sea, they had outsourced the job to the Siddis of Janjira. Being a land-based empire, and coming from land-based dynasties, the Mughals paid little heed to the seas. In contrast, the Ottoman Empire were good at sea-faring, and efficiently checked Portuguese advancements in Indian Ocean for a long time. Once, an Ottoman even led siege to Diu in order to assist the Muslim Sultan of Gujarat against the Portuguese. See Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "No. Practically negligible. They were hence heavily dependant on the siddis and european merchant companies. There is a funny instance noted in history where aurangjeb asked his naval commander to display the mughal naval prowess, it was pretty poor and two mughal galleys fired each other as the canon swivelled at the wrong time sinking both ships. This was around 1660, that was about when aurangjeb decided that he will have to be dependant on others for naval powers. ",
