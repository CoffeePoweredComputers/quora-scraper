            "answer_text": "A2A As others have said, Jamaica isn't \u2018on\u2019 any continent per say, it is an island in the Caribbean Sea; just as Britain is an island in the North Atlantic sea. Even though Britain is an island it\u2019s still a part of the continent of Europe geographically, so is Jamaica lately known as being part of the continent of North America geographically. I say lately because growing up at no point was I aware we were classed as being a part of North America, we were always told Jamaica is in the Caribbean Sea. The term \u2018Middle America\u2019 referring to the countries in the regions of Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico has been thrown around, but it hasn't yet taken root. Who knows, maybe in a few years time that classification will become common knowledge and thus accepted as such. ",

            "answer_text": "Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean, so physically it is not on any continent. However, it is considered a part of the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) region, and is often grouped with (and overlap economies) with Central America.  Despite all this, geo experts still group Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean as a part of North America. See quotation here from North America Map : North America, the planet's 3rd largest continent, includes (23) countries and dozens of possessions and territories. It contains all Caribbean and Central America countries, Bermuda, Canada, Mexico, the United States of America, as well as Greenland - the world's largest island. ",
