Ancient Egyptians were Nilotic people, from the same stock as the Nubians. Professor G. Mokhtar (Egyptian Egyptologist) in \u2018General History of Africa\u2019 vol.2 - UNESCO: \u201cAll references to possible influences coming from Asia during those periods, by way of the Suez isthmus or the Mediterranean coast, thus belong to the realm of supposition.\u201c \u201cMoreover, an invasion of civilizing elements from outside, notably from Mesopotamia, rests only on the flimsiest evidence. \u201c \u201cSouth of the First Cataract [aka in Nubia], we are in the presence of a population having the same composition as that of Upper Egypt. However, Nubia was always unwilling to accept the use of writing (\u2026) On the other hand, in Nubia we have a population that at the dawn of history possessed a material culture equal, if not superior, to that of Upper Egypt, but the population was divided into smaller groups spaced farther apart. (\u2026) The Nubian peoples did not feel the need for writing. (\u2026) The difference in behaviour between two populations of similar ethnic composition throws significant light on an apparently abnormal fact: one of them adopted and perhaps even invented, a system of writing, while the other, which was aware of that writing, disdained it.\u201d \u201cIt has often been implied that Egyptian hieroglyphic writing had been either brought to the valley by invaders from the East or borrowed from Mesopotamia by the Egyptians. The least we can say is that no material trace of such borrowing is visible in the writing of Pharaonic Egypt as we find it at the dawn of history around -3000. On the contrary, we are able to follow its slow formation stage by stage: from pure pictography, to the stage of complex phonograms, to that of phonetic complements, and finally to that of determinatives. Some signs employed phonetically represent objects that were no longer in use when the first texts appear, which proves that the writing was formed in the pre-historic era, when those objects were still in current use. Lastly, and perhaps most important of all, the ancient hieroglyphic symbols were all taken from Nilotic fauna and flora, thus proving that the writing is of purely African origin.\u201d  The hieroglyphs were developed at the dawn of the civilization (4th millennium).
