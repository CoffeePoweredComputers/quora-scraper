            "answer_text": "Unknowable. We are utterly dependent upon that technology. Pre-industrial farming cannot sustain 7.5 billion people. So if you mean \u201cA few hundred thousand of them.\u201d It\u2019s still really unknowable because how will they survive? Do we send them back with a pre-industrial starter kit? Bows? Arrows? Clubs? Hides for protection? In the end, if we sent back a population of 10,000 people with all our modern knowledge plus training to survive, most of that information wouldn\u2019t make the trip. Our brains are limited, this is why the cognitive revolution and the subsequent revolutions changed us so much. For most of our history, our brains were the limiting factor and we conveyed the information from one brain to the other mostly through songs and legends. We had a lifetime of on-the-job training that we did for our children, but that was it. We were generalists who wandered and hunted. Once we started agriculture and then written language, the limiting factor of one-brain-to-another ceased being a thing. We could take the accumulated data from a lifetime of work and put it on stone or paper. But even that was limited to certain information and not all information was transmitted. In the end, if you sent people back with appropriate knowledge and training, they MIGHT get to the agricultural revolution + highly refined spoken language and writing before they all died of whatever ailments would kill them. That would give subsequent generations a head start. But they\u2019d have to quickly get that information written down and taught to their kids. So if all things were equal and they started off at that point, you might have a few thousand years before they reached our point \u2014 provided that they didn\u2019t kill themselves, weren\u2019t wiped out by a pandemic or weren\u2019t hampered by the same issues that plagued our existence (but in different, more frequent or lesser forms during that time). In the end, it\u2019s unknowable and nothing more than speculative fiction. ",

            "answer_text": "My guess is that things would be rebuilt about four times faster. Much of technology would be forgotten and would have to be rediscovered later; this has happened in the past for instance with the fall of Greek civilization. All of the Internet would be lost, all libraries would be lost, and most of the geniuses who figured out calculus, engineering, music, biology and so much of our wealth of science and culture are dead. Even if you understand the basics of engineering, could you keep that knowledge going and build upon it in a society that now had no computers, no books, no paper, just an oral tradition? All people would have to become hunter-foragers just in order to survive. They can\u2019t order clothing online, so they\u2019d have to figure out how to cure and fashion animal skins; they\u2019d have their hands full just staying alive and consequently few could afford to even teach what they know to their children. And if you\u2019re first generation in that era, would you teach your children how to find food and survive? Or would you try to recite from memory ancient poems and explain electron dot diagrams? So there you go. What took a million years to do the first time around might be accomplished in 250,000 years, but it certainly won\u2019t be accomplished overnight. ",
