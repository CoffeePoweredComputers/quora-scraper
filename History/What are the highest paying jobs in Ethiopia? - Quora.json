            "answer_text": "Yes, Tesfa is right. The NGOs are the top paid positions. There are also a number of government posts where you get small amount of official salary; but grab huge amount of government money by going out field works for every little activity. Those areas where you have to go for a field work, you get 10 times your salary every month. That is another way of getting big money while still enjoying your trips with the government car and infrastructure. Agriculture is one of these; health another of these fields. ",
