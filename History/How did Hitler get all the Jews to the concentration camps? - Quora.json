            "answer_text": "Im not sure if you\u2019re asking in regard to logistics or how the Nazi\u2019s convinced millions to go. In regard to the first question, the majority if not all of the people were transported in cattle cars by rail. The majority of the camps had a railway stop right outside where the people were offloaded and processed, in regard to a camp like Auschwitz, the rail line literally went into the camp. In regard to the second part, the main reason why people went reasonably willingly was because of Nazi deception which was key to this whole process. The Nazi\u2019s knew that they could not risk massive uprisings and therefore had to deceive the masses. Promises that people were being redistributed to work camps, in some instances people were issued with return rail tickets, luggage was recorded and people were given tickets so they can claim their stuff on arrival. There were Jews hired to as ghetto leaders who added to the deception promising all will be ok. Not many people had any idea of what was going to happen let alone the fact that the majority of them would be killed on arrival. ",
