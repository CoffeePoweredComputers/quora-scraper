            "answer_text": "Mainly the Middle Ages are characterized by being nasty, brutish and long. That's the short answer, the long answer is that, in the early stages, there was a lack of authorities with a monopoly on the use of force, and later on by the formation of larger states which brought some stability to their regions, although inter-state warfare was still common. The early Middle Ages, commonly referred to as the Dark Ages, are generally dated to 476, when the Roman Empire finally blinked out of existence. In truth, the Empire had been contracting in the West for some time before that, and the death of Emperor Romulus was just a convenient point to declare it dead. For some time prior to this, barbarian Germanic leaders had been the real rulers of the Empire, and it had been losing territory and authority for decades, if not a century or longer. At this point, there were any number of tribes in Western Europe who had set up small kingdoms and coopted portions of the Empire. With a lack of central control, people in the countryside (this was most people, since with the loss of central control and the loss of North Africa, then the breadbasket of Rome, cities could not be supplied to the extent they had been previously) began to accept protection from local strongmen in return for a portion of their production. This later evolved into the feudal system, where the strongest warlords set their followers up as vassals, giving rise to the various levels of nobility in society. As always in nearly every society, those without power or the ability to protect themselves became the lower classes, and over time were declared to be tied to the land as peasants. This wasn't so different from what had occurred in the late Roman Empire, when the wealthy aggregated land and workers to themselves and took them out of the Empire\u2019s tax system, which was one of the causes of the fall of the Empire. As time went on and various tribal leaders emerged over larger land areas, states began reappearing.  This took some time, so in the early Middle Ages, things were fragmented, and trade and travel ground to a halt, as the road networks deteriorated and a lack of central order gave rise to increasing insecurity for everyone, but especially traders, travelers, and those without recourse to force.  Eventually, the social order that had emerged became codified into law, and larger organizations controlling greater land masses began to organize.  This was the High Middle Ages, when kingdoms evolved from the earlier barbarian tribes, and learning began to come back out of the monasteries where it had been maintained during the uncertainty of the 6thand 7th centuries.  The Middle Ages ended, depending on which historian you listen to, somewhere between the 14th and 16 th centuries with the rise of nation-states that are recognizable to us today.  The need for well-armed strongmen (which is what the nobility were in essence) declined, as technology advanced and new weapons made the highly skilled warriors that had dominated society obsolete.  New and old technologies and knowledge were developed or reintroduced from where it had been preserved, in the monasteries and the Arab world.This is by necessity a brief glossing over of the period, which little attention being given to several major forces that shaped the time, such as the Church and the Eastern Empire, which lasted in some form until the late 15thcentury, when Constantinople fell.
