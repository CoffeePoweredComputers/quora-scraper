            "answer_text": "How much would it cost? Really? Honestly, it\u2026. okay, I\u2019ll answer that. Assume he has a job and she does not. It would cost whatever it costs to educate her and get her working. A smart polygamist would send her to a four year degree school, for nursing, doctor, engineer, psychologist, something that is career based and with great rewards\u2026 but then a polygamist would be careful to marry the smartest, strongest, and wisest women he could find, then put his efforts into making her even more. So now he\u2019s working, she\u2019s working in her career, and assume they both make about 75K each, that\u2019s 150 a year cost. SO he marries again. The smartest, strongest, wisest women he can find. They put HER through school. After four years, she\u2019s probably at 100K now, and he\u2019s probably about the same, so 200K, plus the income for the second wife, let\u2019s say 50K Third wife, that would be four more years, but let\u2019s simplify this\u2026 he married three more that year. Highly likely as who would not want to be married to a great guy like this. So now, four years later, he\u2019s at 125K, 1\u2019s at 125K, 2\u2019s at 100K, 3\u20134\u20135\u2019s at 50K, that\u2019s a grand total of $500,000 a year. It\u2019s also, if he chose well, a family with a doctor, lawyer, nurse, teacher, and professor as soon as the 1st gets her masters. This is the cost of maintaining these poor desperate women in the USA. ",

Living Wage Calculator gives you a starting point for 2 parents and 3 children 1 worker, And 2 worker You need to pick your city and county . And be advised that your marriage will not be recognized by any state in the union or DC or any u.s. territory And, it is highly likely that any wives beyond the primary will even be denied entry to the united states (if any of you or your family are granted entry) I believe they are still giving special scrutiny to regions that have legal or cultural polygamy (polyandry or polygyny) ",
