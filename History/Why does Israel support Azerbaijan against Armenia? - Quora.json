            "answer_text": "Your premise that Israel supports Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia is wrong. Israel maintains diplomatic relations with both countries and has voiced no support to either side. It is true however,m that the relations with Azerbaijan have become progressively warmer while with Armenia there\u2019s a distinct cooling down in the past years, once Armenia began its overtures towards Iran. Armenia buys (sort of) its weapons from Russia while Azerbaijan buys from the EU and the U.S., as well as from Israel. Armenia, for its own reasoning, chose to distance itself from Israel and this takes form not just of cancelled high-level visits but also of tolerance and a blind eye to consistently antisemitic publications in the past decade. This does not translate to any formal policy, but had an impact on the relations. These are the facts, and you should not confuse somewhat unbalanced cordial relations and expanding commercial relations with active support in a national conflict. Israel has no upside or reason to get involved in this conflict, or similar conflicts, between countries she enjoys peaceful relations with. ",

            "answer_text": "Israel likes to think of itself as a principled country which, unfortunately, is sometimes forced by its uniquely embattled position to keep quiet about this or that matter of principle. From such a standpoint, Israel loses a little credibility when it calls on other countries to behave toward itself more on grounds of principle and less on grounds of self-centered short-term realpolitik. True, they may be a lot less embattled than Israel, but every country has an easy time thinking of excuses not to do the right thing. As for Azerbaijan vs. Armenia in specific, Amit Meltzer sounds as if he knows what he\u2019s talking about. From the little I understand about the issue, my sympathies are with Armenia regarding Nagoro Karabakh\u2014 at least until someone can explain to me why a formerly Armenian territory populated by ethnic Armenians shouldn\u2019t be allowed to ally itself with Armenia.
