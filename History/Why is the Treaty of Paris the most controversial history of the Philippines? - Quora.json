            "answer_text": "The Treaty of Paris officially ended the Spanish-American War. The once-proud Spanish empire was virtually dissolved as the United States took over much of Spain\u2019s overseas holdings. Puerto Rico and Guam were ceded to the United States, the Philippines were bought for $20 million, and Cuba became a U.S. protectorate. Philippine insurgents who fought against Spanish rule during the war immediately turned their guns against the new occupiers, and 10 times more U.S. troops died suppressing the Philippines than in defeating Spain. You have to wonder if it was worth it and the people of the Philippines hate us to this day for what we did to them. ",

            "answer_text": "The treaty which was concluded in Paris, thousands of miles away from the Philippines was flawed. It was based on the assumption that Spain had control of the Philippines when large areas of the territory were in the hands of Filipino Revolutionaries. If some provinces and cities were in the hands of the Spaniards it was only a matter of time when the local officials who were in charge of the territorial militias could switch sides and declare their allegiance to the Philippine Revolutionary Government. This happened in Iloilo where the supposedly pro-Spanish elite suddenly shifted sides and declared allegiance to the government in Malolos. Or the same elite could establish a government independent of Aguinaldo\u2019s government. This happened in the neighboring island Negros which established a federal government but recognized a protectorate under the United States. In the little island of Cuyo, the local elites there crafted a constitution and established a government totally independent of that of Aguinaldo\u2019s. Spanish authority over the islands was crumbling and Spain cannot cede what it does not have - actual and complete control of the islands. the Americans should have dealt with them but it should be with the Filipino leaders. On the side of the Americans they cannot accept what the Spaniards did not have anymore. When the treaty was concluded, what they have in their control was the city of Manila and the port of Cavite. They cannot expect the Filipinos to abide by Treaty because they themselves declared independence and they later crafted a constitution. After the Treaty of Paris was signed on December 10, 1898 the Filipinos formed a Republic which was inaugurated on January 23, 1899. To enforce the treaty certainly meant war. Another thing that American leaders like McKinley ignored was many of the Americans were actually opposed to the annexation of the Philippines. Some of them saw the great costs in terms of money and lives in subduing the 15,000 strong Filipino Army, not to mention the Moro tribes in the south. Others saw the impracticality of managing a territory 7,000 miles away. Others still disliked having Filipinos as future citizens of the American Republic because they were incapable of self-government. Another reason was racial in nature. They preferred that the American leaders sell the islands to an interested power and thus recoup the amount spent by their government in the Spanish-American War. The last alternative is to leave the islands alone. ",
