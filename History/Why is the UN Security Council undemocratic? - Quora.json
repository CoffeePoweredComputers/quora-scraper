            "answer_text": "Going with your linear assumption that the UN Security Council IS undemocratic, to answer your question, it turns out because of the following reasons: Inadequate representation of members. Where there are 193 members of the UN, only 15 of them are represented in the Security Council, out of which 5 are permanent members. This essentially means that approximately only 7.5% of the world is represented at the world's most powerful international body which can enforce and implement its decisions. The probability of a member state to become a member of the Security Council, every two years, is about a meager 0.05. And these 7.5% countries are responsible for taking decisions which affect all of the world.Observer states don't have voting rights. Essentially, if you're not the member of the Security Council, at a given point of time, and the SC passes a resolution to the effect of sending military forces to your country and intervene in your disputes, you cannot even vote a no, or vote against it, in other words.The veto power. This is arguably the most undemocratic component of the Security Council. For those who don't know, the five permanent members or the P5 - USA, UK, France, Russia and the People's Republic of China have special voting rights. These countries have the veto power, i.e. if they vote against a resolution in the Security Council, it will not pass. (Read Article 27 - Chapter V | United Nations) This essentially means, the Security Council will never be able to take action against the P5 or their very close allies, because they will obviously, veto the resolutions. This has been used multiple times, where China vetoed India's moves against Pakistan-based terrorism, and by USA, to protect the interests of its ally, Israel. All the members have used the veto in the history of the Security Council. The P5 in the Security Council is best described as \"The more equals among the equals.\"This should answer your question.

Like it or not, there is no real democracy in this world, only distorted and skewed pseudo-democracy, and we couldnt do anything about it. Actually UNSC is more democratic than they can be, at least you have chance to convince P5 which is much superior than the rest of the world in combined strength. ",
