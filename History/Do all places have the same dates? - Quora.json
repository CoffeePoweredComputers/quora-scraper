            "answer_text": "well, do you mean the same calendar? Then yes, every place follows the same dates, even if they might have a \u2018religious\u2019 calendar that is different. If you mean does everyplace have the same date at THIS MOMENT, then no. The International Dateline separates the globe into today and tomorrow (or tomorrow and today). There are 24 Time Zones, one for each hour of the day. The day \u201cbegins\u201d in Australia, but it\u2019s a big country (as large as the US), with several Time Zones. So, when it is 12am Tuesday in Brisbane (East coast), it is still 10PM Monday night in Perth. Another example would be: I\u2019m in St. Louis, where it is 11pm on Monday night. But in New York City it is 12am Tuesday morning. ",
