            "answer_text": "Barca is not a surname nor an epithet attributed to Hannibal, the usage is erroneous. The Carthaginians had maintained contact with various peoples on their side of the Mediterranean, including Iberians, Gauls, and Greeks. Greeks formed the majority of the Carthaginian elites\u2019 educational core, even Hannibal would have a Spartan tutor, no doubt retained as a slave. They would even intermarry among these people; on more than one occasion a Carthaginian figure had a Sicilian mother. When war broke out with Rome, it was practically a sudden expansion of the scope of the fighting in Sicily, so the only practical recourse for Carthage was to send word out to all the various peoples they know about asking for troops to come and fight on the city\u2019s behalf. This was the start of large influx of mercenaries (and their families) to the war zone of Sicily. After the war\u2019s end Carthage was unable to pay the mercenaries due to their defeat; the bloody revolt was crushed by, ironically, another mercenary army raised by the Carthaginians. Hamilcar would set off to consolidate the Carthaginian presence in modern Spain using the army assembled to retake Sardinia (the campaign was aborted by what was effectively a betrayal of Roman diplomatic courtesy), and through a mixture of friendly political overtures, intimidation and outright warfare, would assemble an alliance with the various Iberian and Celtic tribes within the Carthaginian sphere of influence. When the second war broke out, Hannibal made sure to know what routes to take for an overland journey to Italy, seeing as a seaborne invasion was out of the question. His Greek education certainly helped in interpretation and diplomacy in gaining rapport among the various Celtic tribes that didn\u2019t find Rome\u2019s expansion on their turf preferable to siding with a powerful host that sought to reverse their fortunes. I mean you\u2019re stuck with two options- fight Rome, or fight someone that\u2019s against Rome, to which Rome might not even reward you for the suicide. So the short answer is, Hannibal himself would not speak to the various Gauls, he would have had plenty of interpreters, and those Gauls may be willing to throw their support on their own initiative. Slaughtering a few recalcitrant tribes on the way through the Alps certainly played a part in convincing the Gauls to act smart. The shorter answer: interpreters, political connections, and show of force. Domineering violence is one of humanity\u2019s universal languages. ",

            "answer_text": "The Carthaginians were active across the western Mediterranean, so it\u2019s not unlikely there were interpreters on one or both sides. If not that, then it\u2019s very likely that Hannibal may have had a Greek interpreter from one of the Greek colonies in southern Gaul (like Massilia), who would have had to speak to and trade with the local tribes. This, along with the fact that Greek was probably understood by a lot of Carthaginians (and thus Hannibal) seems the most likely solution. Worst case scenario, Hannibal\u2019s army consisted of a large number of Celtiberians, whose language may have been similar to the southern Gauls due to their geographic proximity, so it\u2019s possible he could have used them as interpreters if Gallic and Celtiberian were mutually intelligible.
