            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a long story. The Norse settlements in the North Atlantic islands were not colonies as we think of them today. They were not organized, financed or supported by Norse kings, nobles or corporations. They were settlements made by small groups of Norseman searching on there own for opportunities in new lands as fields and others resources became scarce in the old Norse domains, which at that time included parts the Orkneys and parts of Ireland, themselves on the fringes of rule in by Norse states in Europa. These new islands had at most a few European settlers (Iceland) or a few natives (Greenland). However people in the the new lands, Iceland and Greenland, although independenct, could not exist isolated from the Europe they had left. They needed resources they could not produce locally, most importantly iron for tools and timber for building boats. And as the became more prosperous, even stained glass for churches. Iceland exportd dried fish, cloth, and sulfur to pay for imports. Greenland exported walrus tusks and walrus hides. To first to make luxury goods, the second to make ropes. Norse settlements on the North American mainland were thinly populated, primarily sources of timber for Greenland. They had to deal with large population of natives, skilled in war. And they were still dependent on iron they could only obtain from Europe by way of Greenland. By the early 1409s the European demand for Walrus tusks and hides ended. Few ships ventured to Greenland, which had nothing to sell. The Norse in Greenland were now cut off from a supply of iron and any timber they imported from Europe. Even the Catholic Church lost interest in the impoverished settlements there. So, the Norse settlements in Greenland disappeared. An exodus of young people moving back to Iceland or further east, looking for better opportunities, is as good an explanation for the disappearance, as hypothesises about climate change or attack by natives moving south. And without settlements in Greenland to supply iron tools, there was no way permanent settlements in North America could survive, No Norse kings or lords were now interested in such distant settlements, anymore than they had been interested in the earlier settlements of Iceland and Greenland. They had enough opportunities in Europe. Abandoned Colony in Greenland: Archaeologists Find Clues to Viking Mystery - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International  ",

            "answer_text": "There is nothing in Viking Sagas that indicate that the discovery of North America was considered special by the norsemen. So the likely answer why they didn't colonize or create permanent settlements is that the Vikings didn't realize the importance of the discovered land and simply didn't make a collected effort. As he had already converted to Christianity, one could argue that Leif Erikson wasn't a Viking when he made his journey to explore reported sightings of land west of Greenland. He had been given the mission of introducing Christianity to Greenland, and his motivation of making his journey west of Greenland was neither to plunder nor to colonize. After spending a winter in Newfoundland, his expedition returned to Greenland with a cargo of grapes and timber. While other norsemen made many journeys back in the following centuries, they were mainly to aquire furs and lumber, which was in short supply in Greenland. It is also worth noting that Christopher Columbus visited Iceland in 1477, and that there is significant circumstantial evidence that he first heard about land in the west from the norsemen; Chapter III.
