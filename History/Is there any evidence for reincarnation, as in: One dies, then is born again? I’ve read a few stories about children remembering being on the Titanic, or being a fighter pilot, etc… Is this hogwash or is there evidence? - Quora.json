            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if this will convince you if reincarnation exists or not, but I do have a story to tell. Whether this is evidence to you, it\u2019s your own decision. My mom believes in reincarnation herself. She once had a teacher who was kind of an expert in this area. They met when my mom took a\u2026 Fengshui class, I believe. He was so good at what he does that he can even tell who you were in your past life, how your life will go in your present life, all the twists and turns that you will endure and all that stuff. I know that this may sound unbelievable to some, but my mom respected him and even claimed to me that he was one of the best teachers that she ever had. He was the person who told my mom who she was in her past life. I remember it was pretty late one night (around 11 pm already), and I was about to go to sleep when my mom and I somehow started an unexpected deep conversation. It was during this conversation when she told me this story. I swear that I did not make up any parts of this story; I am merely paraphrasing what my mom told me. My mom was a male in her past life, and she and my dad were best friends (yeah, I was pretty shocked when my mom told me this too). In fact, they were such close friends that they were basically brothers. When they grew older, they even decided to open up a business of their own to make money together. Talk about bromance! So things went fine for awhile before my dad found out that my mom was cheating money from him. It was either that or my mom was getting the larger share of the profit. This is when their friendship started to deteriorate. What was once a wonderful friendship turned into a hostile battle of arguments and fights. It even came to a point where they couldn\u2019t even speak to each other without fighting. This sounds terrible, and it was. Imagine breaking up with your best friend, your closest friend, right now. This might seem like an impossible thought. It\u2019s hard to imagine someone close to you turning into your enemy. Finally one night, they called a truce and agreed to meet up in a restaurant of some sort to try to resolve their issues. This is when things went down. According to my mom, things didn\u2019t go well. The biggest fight broke out between the two. Fists were flailing, faces were reddening, shouts were thrown, skin was scratched and cut. My mom somehow even took a pretty big swing (or stab, or whatever she used) at my dad and gave him a pretty serious injury on his right arm. The fight escalated as more bruises and cuts materialized and both got angrier and angrier. All of a sudden, amidst his anger, my dad shoved my mom backward, hard. It was probably just to keep her off balance, I don\u2019t know, but my mom fell out of the window. Since I obviously wasn\u2019t there I can\u2019t tell you exactly how it happened, but in my mind, my mom had her back to a conveniently placed window as my dad pushed her out of it. When my dad looked out, he realized with a start that my mom had fallen too far below, and was slowly losing consciousness. My dad couldn\u2019t do anything besides watch from the window above as she (he?) died. That\u2019s right. My dad was the one who killed my mom in his past life. The thing is, he had never intended to do so. They were, after all, best friends who got into a serious feud because of money. All of the arguments and fights between them were forgotten then. My dad was probably a mess. True, he was pretty angry, but he never intended to kill anybody, let alone a close friend of his. He deeply regretted what he had done and at the moment his biggest wish was he could have had the chance to save his best friend, my mom. And this is why he decided that for the remainder for the rest of his life, he would do everything within his power to save the lives of other people. What does this story have to do with anything? You may ask. Well now, here comes the interesting part: You know how my dad wanted to save lives as his wish in his past life? Well, surprise surprise, he\u2019s a doctor in this life. What\u2019s also an interesting thing to note is that my dad wasn\u2019t naturally born to become a doctor. He had to work harder than his brothers (who are also doctors; we\u2019re Asian, but that\u2019s off topic) to get into medical school.Because my dad basically killed my mom, karma indicates that he has to pay for what he has done by taking care of my mom in return. This is why they became married in this life. (Cool, huh?)Do you know why in their past lives my mom was the one who started this feud by cheating money from my dad? You can actually see the reason in their personalities even now. My mom is the smarter one, the one with quicker wits, while my dad was more honest and naive. Naturally if you\u2019re smarter you\u2019ll try to find ways to increase your benefit by \u201cpreying\u201d on the people who were less quick.You remember that injury that my mom gave my dad on his right arm? My dad actually has a scar there right now, which he claimed that he had gotten when he burned himself when he was little. A bit too convenient that both of these injuries happened in the same place, right? You decide. I actually wanted to take a picture but asking my dad if I could take a picture of his arm for no reason is kind of awkward.So there\u2019s the story between my mom and dad. It\u2019s interesting, to say the least. If you do believe in reincarnation and karma you would see all the cause-and-effects that the past lives of my parents have brought into their current life. My mom even told me a brief story of how strong emotions like love and hate, or strong connections that you have made with other people, could bleed into your next life as well, no matter positive or negative. This story also made me wonder\u2026 All of these people around me, who were also the ones that I have known in my past life? And what relationships did they have with me? This scar that I have on my knee\u2026 Is there a deeper reason why I have it besides the simple \u201cI fell down on the sidewalk.\u201d? I have pondered these questions ever since. Evidence of reincarnation? The story of my parents is proof. You are proof. You just don\u2019t know it. And if you don\u2019t believe in any of that, then hey, at least you read a pretty cool story!

            "answer_text": "I have a one for you. As a child of 8 or 9 years of age I had a dream about how I had died. In this dream I was dressed in armor walking with another similarly dressed nearby a wall. In front of us was a stone archway and to my right there was a breach in the wall higher up. Suddenly a spear came through the breach and struck me in my abdomen and then I pulled it out and noticed no pain, then the dream ended. Years later a good friend of mine challenged me in such a way I immediately stood up to face him. As I did he took one step back and commented \u201cI just saw you standing there in armor with a sword at your side\u201d All of this now occurred over 50 years ago and 41. It had been something that I would think about from time to time. Thinking that from my dream that I might have been a Roman. I decided to look and see if there might have been a man who died this way. And I found such a man! His name is Marcus Claudius Marcellus a Roman consul who fought Hannibal and over ran Syracuse in 213 BC. He died while on reconnaissance with Titus Crispinus in Venusia, Italy. They were ambushed by Carthaginians and he was impaled with a spear by various accounts and died in the field. My dream shows that the Carthaginians were hidden behind the wall. That Marcellus was killed by chance in the first attempt. That the companion I was walking with was Crispinus. As to the challenge my friend gave me and my response to it. Marcellus accepted all challenges and he killed all men in single armed combat. I am in many ways the same. Even more so is what I\u2019ve learned to do in this life. Stay prepared in mind for unknown situations. I in another life was caught with my pants down as it were and it cost me my life. Here is the interesting part. There is a memorial stone marker in the now named Venosa with part of the wall still remaining. But the marker is in the wrong place. Should be much further away given the nature of how a spear arches. I have even more to tie into this. Last year in 2018 I saw 4 lights ascend into the sky just south of SFO. I was in San Leandro and I am very familiar with air traffic in the area. These objects were a combination of red and white lights. There were no observable port and starboard lighting. There were no flashing beacons just solid colored lighting. And they traveled upward along a flight path that NO air traffic takes. I reported this to MUFON on Dec. 22, 2018. There were 4 of them, one first then a few minutes later 2 in tandem and no sooner they disappeared one more. About a week later I realized this was a sword formation. Point, guards and pommel or rear guard. They were heading west around 7PM on Dec 21 the day of the winter solstice. In myth the day of resurrection.What I never mentioned was a few things. I never reported an event aligned with the sighting. I had just stepped out for a smoke. When suddenly an object suddenly appeared from behind a light pole the had a slight tapered tip. Had no rotor blades as a drone we produce. Had a red light, it\u2019s coloration was familiar to me as not being a solid physical object but like it was more holographic. I watched it bob and weave along the rooftops of homes go behind a tree then reappear and stop in front of a building, rise up and flash a white light in my direction 3 times. What is also interesting was the day before I was thinking out of the blue about a rabbit. Then the following day was this event. I was supposed to chase the rabbit and play. On the 20th on the way back home I had a mental image of a woman in a black uniform with a very concerned look on her face. Then the event I reported on the 21st happened. When the last object rose up I felt an energy that (I\u2019m a sensitive so I\u2019m aware of various energy\u2019s etc) was yellowish and a voice (telepathy) say \u201cmay glory be upon you\u201d Marcellus was named the \u201cThe Sword of Rome\u201d in honor of his dedication. A sword formation by these humans. I believe that was for my benefit. They know who I am! Who I have been!  ",
