            "answer_text": "I have absolutely no idea whether Iranians living in Iran are practicing Muslims. I think the obvious answer would be \u2018yes\u2019, since Iran is an Islamic state, but I have my doubts. Now, if you were to ask me whether Iranians living abroad are practicing Muslims, I would have to say \u2018no\u2019. On the 11th of August, I attended a wedding at the prestigious Royal York hotel located in Toronto. There was an open bar and everyone was having a great time when all of a suddenly, the bar closed. I struck a conversation with a few Iranians at the wedding who I thought were Pakistanis at first (I thought one of them was from Afghanistan too). We decided to head downstairs to a bar for a shot of Hennessy and began talking about politics. An elder white gentlemen wanted to know why there was tension between Iranians and Iraqis. I mentioned it was because of Saddam Hussein and the Iranian stated it was because Islam was forced upon them by Arabs. I went on to say how forced conversions were rare and that academic historians disagreed with his statement (the \u201cIslam was spread by the sword\u201d narrative). I told him that Iranians gradually converted to Islam over the span of 300 years by missionaries giving da\u2019wah (inviting people to Islam) across Iran. He disagreed and stated even though forced conversions were rare in Islamic history, they did take place in Iran. I then realized he couldn\u2019t even cite a single reference to his claims, while I cited historians such as Bernard Lewis According to Bernard Lewis: \"Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran reemerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna.\" As Bernard Lewis has further quoted \"These events have been variously seen in Iran: by some as a blessing, the advent of the true faith, the end of the age of ignorance and heathenism; by others as a humiliating national defeat, the conquest and subjugation of the country by foreign invaders. Both perceptions are of course valid, depending on one's angle of vision.\" Prior to the conquest of Iran by the Arabs, Zoroastrian priests levied heavy taxes on locals. They were forced to pay a large tribute in order to engage in rituals and rites, and also anytime they went to a fire temple for worship. If I\u2019m wrong about this, then I stand corrected. However, please provide a reputed source concurring with your view if you choose to disprove my claims. The two men ate pork and probably weren\u2019t Muslims, but they were easy going individuals and I have nothing against them. Just to be clear. **EDIT I\u2019m no longer a fan of Bernard Lewis\u2019 works, however, Richard Frye specialized in Central Asian and Iranian history. I would highly recommend reading his work regarding the Islamic conquest of Persia. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a lot of young Iranian friends who live in Tehran. They all tell me the same thing: hard-line, devout Muslims are a minority. Most youth (and people who lived before the revolution) are not devout. That's a vast majority. Most people have sex before marriage; many divorce; many drink alcohol; many can find bacon and pork easily; many dislike the regime; many (especially women) wish for more equality; many Iranians are atheists. They just have to be seen to be subscribing to Islam, even when they don't believe in it. And they all know with each other that they are pretending. The only people they can't be honest with that around are the Imams. Most Iranians are sensible, smart, kind, funny, lively people at heart, who unfortunately were promised the world in the revolution and ended up with a government who do not listen to their wants and needs. From my experience, most Iranians are not practicing Muslims. ",

And after 1501, I mean the beginning of the Safavid dynasty, Shiaism turned to be the main denomination of Iranians. Except small minority of Christianity and Judaism, Iranians are Muslim and the majority of them are practicing Islam. In fact, Islam is part of Iranian identity and Iran is the homeland of many outstanding Muslim scholars such as Mulla Sadra, Ibn Arabi, Hakim Neishbouri, Qazzali, Muslim Neishabouri, Allama Hilli, Sheikh Tousi, Allama Tabatabaeii, Imam Khomeini, and etc. Iranians are devoted Muslims as they are practicing the Islamic social and political dimensions. Therefore, we have Islamic Republic in Iran which Islam is rooted in its constitutional law contrary to other mostly secular Muslim countries which are not Islamic country.

While the majority of Iranians in Iran do identify as Muslims, only perhaps as many as 50% of them are practicing Muslims, whereas the other 50% are non-practicing. Some of my fellow Quorans from Iran have even suggested that the amount of practicing Iranian Muslims is as low as 15\u201330% of the total population.

Most of them belong to the Shia sect which have a misconception of Islam based on the idea of succeeding leaders after the Prophet (salla allahu alayi wa selem). Thus they blind-follow some leaders which they think are special and these leaders may not even practice the rituals probably. Shias are well known to be lax and resemble Christians or people of other faiths where it is not important to practice. Because they do not stick to the revealed texts. Instead they have a set of books which have not be verified by the majority of Muslims. Approximately 20% of Iranians are Sunnis which means to follow the Quran and Hadith with the understanding of the Salaf (the companions of the Prophet May God\u2019s peace and blessing be upon him) ",

Are they practicing Muslims? In Iran school teachers and even Quran teachers are caught in same sex act with children. Is that really what the Muslim practice? If so, all Iranians are.

So maybe you will see some disobediences to Islam, but even it doesn\u2019t mean that they are against Islam. Therefore, the most of Iranian people are devout Muslims and do practice Islam, and even those who don't practice Islam, they still usually consider Islam as the integral part of their identity. Some western media try to propagate that Iranian don\u2019t follow Islam, but Islam is integral part of Iranians\u2019 identity and Indeed, the nationality and the religion of Iranians are intertwined and they call themselves Muslim.
