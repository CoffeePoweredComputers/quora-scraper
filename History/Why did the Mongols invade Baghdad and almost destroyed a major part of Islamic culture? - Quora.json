She asked who he was and was told that he was a Muslim scholar. So she asked him to be summoned before her. When he arrived, she asked him, \u201cAre you not the ones who believe in Allah?\u201d He replied, \u201cOf course.\u201d She said, \u201cDo you not claim that Allah supports and grants victory to whom He wills?\u201d He replied, \u201cOf course.\u201d She said, \u201cHas Allah not granted us victory over you?\u201d He said, \u201cYes.\u201d She said, \u201cDoes that not mean that we are more beloved to Allah than you?\u201d He said, \u201cNo.\u201d She asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d He said, \u201cDo you not know of the shepherd?\u201d She replied, \u201cOf course.\u201d He said, \u201cAren\u2019t there some dogs with his flock (of sheep)?\u201d She said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat does the shepherd do when some of his flock wander off and leave his authority?\u201d She said, \u201cHe sends his dogs to bring them back under his authority.\u201d He said, \u201cFor how long do the dogs continue to chase after the sheep? \u201d She replied, \u201cAs long as they remain astray.\u201d So he said, \u201cO Tartars, you are the dogs of Allah( God Almighty) on His earth, and as long as we Muslims remain astray from the path and obedience of Allah, you will remain behind us until we return to Him!\u201d ",
