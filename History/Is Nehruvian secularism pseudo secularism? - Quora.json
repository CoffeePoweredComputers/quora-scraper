            "answer_text": "Is Nehruvian Secularism pseudo secularism? Nehruvian Secularism, meaning Secularism at the time of Nehru I think was the best secularism India has known till date, it was not the best but still much better than what we have now.  After Nehru we stepped on a slippery slope and are descending continuously. What really is pseudo secularism. Technically Secularism that is not followed ethically, honestly with Indian constitution and Human rights in mind, is pseudo secularism. Pseudo psecularism has two sides of its artificiality. One pseudo secularism described by lots of Indians and other pseudo secularism elaborated by Minorities living in India specially Muslims the biggest minority in India. Pseudo secularism from the majority point of view is that Muslims are given too many privileges like Haj Subsidy, and Muslim personal law, minority commission and many Muslim/minority institutions with very little government interference. Minoritirs are given statutory holidays for their festivals. Out of total thirteen Presidents of India, three have been Muslim, we are so outrageoysly secular, that now it is making the majority community resentful.\u200e Lots of people believe that Muslims /minorities enjoy too many favors given by the government to Muslim community to get Muslim vote. On this basis political parties have cropped up to say, Muslims are appeased by Congress party and Hindus are victims in their own country. Why we have to be apologitic in our own country, we are in majority. These parties ridicule secularism and call it pseudo secularism. There are political parties who say negative things about Muslims and how they have been spoilt by Congress. The minority side also says, this secularism is just on the paper. In real life there is no secularism. Muslims face acute discrimination in day to day life. Muslims are very poor and uneducated, it is very difficult for Muslims to find jobs. They don't feel very safe either, it has been observed in many communal riots, that Indian provincial police, which is Hindu majority force, almost always acts as Hindus and not as a neutral force to quell the violence. They either don't stop the rioters, or indulge in rioting with rioters. They enjoy unbelievable impunity, nobody is accountable for not carrying out their duty to protect citizens. There have been riots in the past which many called riots against Muslims/Sikhs, with state accomplicity. Various studies have shown that, Muslims find it hard to rent apartments in certain high end buildings, resulting into ghettoization of Muslim community. Another study showed thay for the same or similar qualification, when fake applications were sent, for every ten high caste Hindus , six Dalits and only three Muslims were called for an interview. Which shows, it is extremly hard for a Muslim to get a decent job.  The study done on the status of Muslims, called Justice Sachar commission, revealed that there is serious discrimination against Muslims. In government jobs their share is very minimal compared to their percentage. Some question is there a reason that out of total thirteen Presidents, three were Muslim but out of Hundreds of chief Ministers, not a single Muslim chief minister in India completed full term. People think Muslim president who is just a rubber stamp, looks good as a head of the state where pseudo secularism is practiced. Whenever any act of terrorism takes place, hundreds of young Muslim boys are taken into custody from the vicinity, they stay in prison for years without a trial. Sometimes they are tortured to confessing a crime they never committed. The fact that these boys are from very poor families, they can't afford lawyers and rot in prison for years. Lots of Muslim boys also die in fake encounters. In India fake encounter is a serious issue. For Muslims after sixty eight years of so called appeasement by congress, Sachar commission report came as a reality check. So in the end nobody is happy, Hindus say pseudo secularism, Muslims too say the same. World Report 2015: India  Minority Appeasement, a Game That Helps No Minority. But It Can Cut Up the Country Into Communal Bits  Chapter 3: Appeasement of Minorities  ",

            "answer_text": "On 19th May 2016 ,Congress Party must have placed the champagne bottles back in the larder, given the scale of its setbacks. Two states that were among the handful that it still ruled, Assam and Kerala, went over to the opposition, while in the case of Tamil Nadu, its addition to the DMK fold was not sufficient to compensate for the hold that Chief Minister Jayalalithaa still has among voters in her state, especially women. Even Pondicherry has been much closer a race than in the past. Why has the party done so badly? An explanation vests within the system of Nehruvian secularism that the party has embraced since the 1950s. According to this construct, which has as little to do with secularism as Wahhabism has to do with genuine Islam, the most vicious and toxic variants of communalism are kosher, provided they emanate from religious minorities in India, principally Muslims, the community that got divided into two states in 1947. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s encouragement to the religious frenzy witnessed during the 1919-22 Khilafat agitation, of which the Mahatma was among the most enthusiastic supporters, was a historical blunder that unfortunately has been repeated all too often since then. This was to regard extremists as being the only representatives of Islam, which, in fact, is a religion not of conflict but of peace. The Khilafat movement resulted in such aftershocks as the Moplah massacres in Kerala and the deepening of divisive tendencies within the Muslim community in India, which subsequently allowed M.A. Jinnah to win millions of adherents (mostly in UP and Bihar) for Winston Churchill\u2019s plan of vivisecting India. After the 1945 war, London ensured that Sri Lanka and Myanmar got separated from control by Delhi, and later on, that Pakistan was formed. Jawaharlal Nehru carried such a lessening of geographical boundaries further by allowing Pakistan to retain a third of Kashmir and rejecting the offer from Oman for Gwadar and from the Ranas for Nepal. But for Sardar Patel and V.P. Menon, there would have been half-a-dozen more independent states within the present boundaries of India, including Hyderabad and possibly Travancore. However, the Sardar soon passed away, and being insufficiently sugary in his praise of Nehru, V.P. Menon got sidelined in favour of more emollient officials, who were rewarded by Nehru by the retention of the entire structure of colonial laws and governance of the British raj by Nehru and, of course, his successors. The Manmohan Decade has been in many ways as toxic for the future of India as 1919-22 was, and for the same reason, which is the untrammelled encouragement given to minority communalism in the guise of promoting \u201csecularism\u201d. The Congress has not been alone in such a flawed strategy. In the past, Jyoti Basu used it in Bengal, facilitating a flood of immigrants from Bangladesh and integrating them into his state. Both Mulayam Singh as well as Lalu Yadav have been enthusiastic backers of Nehruvian secularism, ignoring the growth of communal passions within select communities while expressing surprise and displeasure at the reaction such events inevitably created within the Hindu majority. In the 2016 Assembly polls, Mamata Banerjee has succeeded with her Jyoti Basu strategy, but in the coming years, certainly before 2019, a Badruddin Ajmal will emerge in Bengal who will siphon off enough Muslim votes to ensure a stellar BJP performance in the Lok Sabha polls, which is the only election in India that really matters. In Kerala, the Hindus (who are still a majority) have almost entirely left the Congress, even while Muslims have gravitated to the Muslim League and Christians to the Kerala Congress, leaving Rahul Gandhi\u2019s party with only a very thin layer of supporters. In Assam, the Muslims that Tarun Gogoi was relying upon to flock to his standard went over to Ajmal, while Hindus turned away from his party because of its adherence to Nehruvian secularism, in which Hindus have become the victims of discrimination (for example in the shape of control of temples by the state, or edicts such as the RTE), about the few countries in the world besides examples such as Bahrain where the majority community suffers in this manner. What the Mahatma omitted to consider in his enthusiasm for the Khilafat movement (which has interestingly been revived in the present time by Abubakr Al Baghdadi) was that it would open the way for extreme communal tendencies and organisations to emerge. Which is what has happened during the decade of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was open about the fact that for his government, only minorities were the focus, rather than the population as an entirety. The Congress is being outflanked by extreme communal groups such as those led by the Owaisis or the Ajmals, which is precisely what took place during the 1920s and later. BJP spokespersons claim on television that it was \u201cdevelopment\u201d which won them Assam, when the reason for much of their votes in the just concluded Assembly polls was the fact that this is the only party which\u2014once Narendra Modi emerged as its undisputed leader in 2013\u2014has repudiated Nehruvian secularism. Thus far, of course, it does not seem to have found the time to ensure that discriminatory and communal laws such as the RTE be replaced with legislation that is wholly secular i.e. religion neutral. Certainly there ought to be an RTE, but the sacrifices for such a step within the pool of private schools should be shared by all rather than (as Manmohan Singh decreed) only by Hindus. Hopefully, such abominations will end before the 2019 polls, as also such injustices as Hindu temples being under the state and hence the playthings of politicians, of course provided Andhra Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu agrees to cede control over Tirupati, something he was reluctant to do when A.B. Vajpayee was the Prime Minister. Narendra Modi is not Vajpayee. Had voters believed him to be so, they would not have given him the mandate they did in 2014. What is needed is to ensure genuine secularism on the scale of France, where religion and the state have been separated in a most wholesome manner. Those in the US or in the EU who receive Wahhabi funding from Qatar or Saudi Arabia may protest, but if India is to avoid fresh attempts at partition, it is crucial to the future to replace Nehruvian secularism with the genuine variety. As for the Congress, it dwindled from a party with the support of a majority of voters to a party relying on minority votes to the present situation. Rahul Gandhi needs to understand that in the 21st century, to continue to embrace the policies of his paternal great-grandfather and grandmother would be to ensure the fulfilment of Prime Minister Modi\u2019s call for a Congress-mukt Bharat.
