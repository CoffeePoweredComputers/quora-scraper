            "answer_text": "How can so many religious people think that only their religion is the true and best religion? Let's add this to the very long list of things some accuse \"those religious people\" of doing that really, everyone does. Everyone believes their own views are the right ones, and everybody else's are bunk, not just \"religious\" people. Every human thinks they are right and anyone who disagrees is wrong. Of course they do, otherwise, they would not believe what they believe. Democrats and Republicans do this, Cubs and White Sox fans do it, those from one high school do it to those from another, abortion opponents and advocates do it, opposing philosophers do it, people from one place do it to those who live in another place, and even atheists do it. What you are describing is human, not \"religious.\"  So how can those \u201creligious\u201d ones be so arrogant to DARE believe what they believe? (Wait, do only religious ones do that? Don\u2019t we all?) Because \u201creligious\u201d people are people. And all people believe their views are the right views. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be \u201ctheir views.\u201d Something else would. Perhaps you don\u2019t understand this because you\u2019re the only human being on the planet who strongly believes that your own views are wrong? That doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, does it. If you believed your views were wrong, that means your views are something else. Do you believe your views are something other than what they are? No? You believe your views are right? Well, there you go then. Now you understand those silly religious people better! See how easy that was? We see this question come up every week or so. It must be a profound mystery to some people that humans actually believe what they think is true and don\u2019t believe what they think is false. Sorry, but I must be missing something. It just doesn\u2019t seem that complicated to me. Imagine people thinking their own views are RIGHT! That would have to mean some others might be WRONG! How DARE they! ",

            "answer_text": "The true religion teachings are the same There is only one God who has revealed the same message to all prophets. The same message revealed to the prophets by the same God must be consistent Religions are made bad the way that we twist them Although the core religion teachings guide us to believe in God and to do good deeds to help others, scholars of each religion have distorted some teachings in order to prove that their religion is the only true religion and that they have the only way for salvation. Jewish scholars teach that Jews are the chosen people of God Christian Scholars teach that they are the predestined, the glorified, and the chosen before the creation of the world Muslim Scholars teach that Jews are cursed, Christians are misguided, and that Muslims are the truly guided people All those scholars are mistaken Most of what the Jewish scholars teach are not the true teachings as taught by Moses Most of what the Christian scholars teach are not the true teachings as taught by Jesus Most of what the Muslim scholars teach are not the true teachings of Islam The common ground of religion teachings includes: In obedience and repentance is your salvation, if you obey and do good deeds, you will be blessed, if you disobey you will be lost; that is the clear message. That message is the most consistent message by Moses, confirmed by Jesus and by Islamic teachings It is wrong to say Judaism is the right religion because there are many additions and changes to what God has revealed to Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, etc. It is wrong to say that the current teachings of Christianity are the true religion because most of the current teachings are the attractive teachings which are not consistent with thestrict teachings of Jesus. It is wrong to accept all the current teachings of Islam because there are many teachings which contradict the core verses of Qur\u2019an. Prophets did not teach that God has preserved the holy book; they have advised that there will be changes and have warned of such additions and deletions. Amos 8:11-12 teach that People will be thirsty for the true word of God but they will not find it anywhere Psalm 56:5 teaches All day long they twist my words Jeremiah 8:8 teaches the lying pen of the scribes has distorted the word of God Jeremiah 5:30-31 teach that the priests have distorted the religion teachings and that the people love those distorted teachings People are confused by the contradicting teachings, they try to search the internet for the true word of God, but they find many distorted teachings Instead of the consistent and logical teachings like \u2018Do not have two differing measures\u2019, \u2018The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner\u2019, \u2018The foreigner must be treated as your native-born\u2019, \u2018You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born\u2019 in Deuteronomy 25:13-16, Exodus 12:49, Leviticus 19:33-35 , Leviticus 24:22, Numbers 15:15-16, Deuteronomy 24:14-15 The biased scribes have ignored those true teachings and inserted some additions to restrict justice to the \u2018fellow Israelite\u2019, \u2018my people among you\u2019, or \u2018Hebrew men or women\u2019 They do not teach the original teachings anymore; instead, they teach the manipulated teachings like \u201cYou may charge a foreigner interest, but not a fellow Israelite\u201d In Deuteronomy 23:19-20, Exodus 22:25, Deuteronomy 15:1-2, Deuteronomy 15:12 Instead of the true teaching \u2018You shall not murder \u2018in Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17 The scribes who glorify defeating their enemies ignored the true teaching and added some verses to justify the killing like Exodus 23:23, Numbers 31:16-18, Joshua 6:20-21, Judges 15:14-16 and Judges 16:30 Instead of \u2018Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more\u2019 in Isaiah 2:4, they have justified atrocities. Instead of the true and most consistent teachings of \u2018blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 in Leviticus 26, Deuteronomy 28, Deuteronomy 11:26-28, Deuteronomy 4:40, Deuteronomy 6:24-25, Deuteronomy 7:12-15, and Deuteronomy 8, they teach that God has chosen them regardless of their obedience as in the distorted teachings of Deuteronomy 9:5-6 and Deuteronomy 7:6-8 When Jacob\u2019s descendants wanted to glorify him, they claimed that he wrestled with God and was saved. The verses in Genesis 32:24-30 teach that Jacob was able to wrestle with God; he said to God \"I will not let you go unless you bless me\u201d Instead of the true and strict teachings of Jesus in Matthew 7:21-27, Luke 13:25-27, Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Matthew 25:35-45, Mark 12:28-34, Mark 10:17-19, Matthew 19:16-19, Luke 18:18-20, Luke 6:46-48, John 14:15 and John 14:21 most Christian scholars like to boast and teach the attractive teachings like Romans 8:30, 1 Thessalonians 5:9, Ephesians 2:5, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28, Galatians 2:16, Colossians 2:14 and Ephesians 1:4 When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of atonement, they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:11 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who do not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teach that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teach that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood. When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Trinity; they have added verses like 1 John 5:7 \u201cFor there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one\u201d The bible footnotes explain that verse 1 John 5:7 was not in the original old scriptures. The bible footnotes show many other additions in King James Version which were added to support the claims of trinity and which were not in the old scripture; examples are: In I John 4:3 \u2018CHRIST is come in the flesh\u2019 is an addition In Matthew 8:2, 9:18, 15:25, 18:26, 20:20, Mark 5:6 the word \u2018bow down' was changed to \u2018worshiped\u2019. Jesus referred to himself as \u201cson of man\u201d. Jesus was not all-knowledgeable and he prayed to GOD, so this is enough to say that he wasn\u2019t God nor did God come down to earth to be Jesus. Jesus said, \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know You **the only true God**, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.\u201d John 17:3 Jesus said that he does not know everything; he said that only God knows But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father Mark 13:32 Jesus said that he is not equal to God \u201cI can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.\u201d John 5:30 Jesus said, \u201cThe Father is greater than I.\u201d John 14:28 \u201cJesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.\u201d John 7:16 Jesus prayed to God as written in Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16, John 17:11, Matthew 26:39, Luke 10:21, Luke 22:44 \u201cmy Father and your Father; my God and your God\u201d John 20:17 The disciples did not pray to Jesus, they prayed to the God and Father of Jesus \u201cBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d 1 Peter 1:3 The Muslim scholars who justify killing of innocent people are not true Muslims because they do not obey the Qur\u2019an verses like 5:32, 4:90, 2:190, 8:61, 17:33, 25:68 and 6:151 which teach \u2018You shall not kill - God has made life sacred\u2019 The Muslim scholars who teach to kill the unbelievers are mistaken; verse 9:6 is enough proof for their mistakes, because Muslims are supposed to protect the unbelievers and they cannot protect them after killing them The Muslims who justify killing of those who leave Islam are mistaken because they do not obey the Islamic teachings like Qur\u2019an verses 2:256, 16:125 and 18:29 which teach Freedom of Religion The Muslim scholars who justify the killing of the hostages are mistaken; verse 8:70 proves that the hostage is not to be killed, because Muslims are supposed to comfort the hostages and they cannot comfort them after killing them The Muslim scholars who teach that Islam is the only true religion are mistaken; they have been ordered to believe in what has been revealed to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets as taught in Qur\u2019an verse 3:84 The Muslim scholars who teach that the fate of people is determined before they are born and before they have any chance to do good or bad are mistaken; they ignore the basic Qur\u2019an verses like 17:15, 45:15,43:72, 16:35, 19:63, 19:76, 20:112, 34:50, 37:39, 39:41, 39:70, 40:17, 47:17, 55:60, 56:24, 18:107 and 4:147 The verses teach that God does not predestine people\u2019s fate but gives them the choice either to obey and do good deeds or to rebel and do evil deeds; there is no punishment for those who choose to obey and to thank God. Moses warned of the expected turning from the way he has commanded them, in Deuteronomy 31:27-29 he used strong words like \u201cFor I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the LORD while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die!\u201d And \u201cFor I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD and arouse his anger by what your hands have made\u201d Jesus has warned the priests who spend more time in the houses of widows. In Matthew 23:14 he said \u201cWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation\u201d In Matthew 7:15-20, Jesus warned of the false teachers who mislead people Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves The same teaching is also written in Luke 6:43-44 As Moses and Jesus warned of the false teachers who explain religion to their benefits, the prophet of Islam has also warned of those who ignore the true teachings and teach different teachings \u201cI will say those people are from me. It will be said, 'You do not know what changes and new things they did after you.' Then I will say, 'Far removed (from mercy), far removed (from mercy), those who changed (the religion) after me!\u201d That is recorded in Bukhari 7051 Book 92, Hadith 4 and in Volume 9, Book 88, Hadith 174 The best advice is to follow the common ground of the clear teachings as taught by the prophets. The same message revealed to the prophets by the same God must be consistent, clear and easy for all people regardless of their level of education or experience The common ground of religion teachings includes: If you obey and do good deeds to help others then you will be saved and blessed; if you disobey, you will be lost and cursed; that is the clear message. That message is the most reiterated message by the wise inspired teachers, Moses, confirmed by Jesus and by Islamic teachings ",
