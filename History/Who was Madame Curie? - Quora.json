            "answer_text": "Madame Curie\u2019s name was Marie Curie. I don\u2019t know why people her Madame Curie. I grew up thinking of her as just Madame Curie, as though Madame was her first name. I wonder if that women\u2019s first names were not used very often and career women, especially women in science, were so rare that they called her Madame? To me it\u2019s like calling Stephen Hawking, Mr. Hawking, which is fine and all but it seems rather personal. You\u2019d think when I was reading about Marie Curie in my science textbook in Elementary school it would have said Marie instead of Madame, but it didn\u2019t. She won two Nobel prizes and is the only person to win two prizes in two different sciences. She coined the term radioactivity and discovered polonium and radium. She was an innovative scientist, inventor, and a feminist. ",
