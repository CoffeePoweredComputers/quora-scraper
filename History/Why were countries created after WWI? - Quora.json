            "answer_text": "Basically, it was a function of the collapse of the empires that comprised the new countries. The breakup of these empires allowed the different ethnic groups to realize the creation of autonomous countries out of the former territory of the empires. Some were defined by the Paris Peace Talks in 1919 &  others were created/adjusted in battles after WW1 ended. The Modern Middle East had its borders set by agreements (primarily) between France & England. The Central European kingdoms, the same, but without the colonial interests involved. Turkey's eastern borders were set by force of arms after the collapse of Ottoman authority. The Paris border was simply ignored. And, on the other side, Italy was \"given\" Trieste\" in the Paris agreements. Russia devolved into chaos & it was only after the Bolsheviks consolidated power, signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and later fought the Polish\u2013Soviet War that the borders were finally defined (until 1939, anyway).

            "answer_text": "The idea was to give every nation its nation state. The idea ran into problems as people had not settled sorted by nation but all mixed. Another problem was that it was not always clear who was a nation and who wasn\u2019t and also that these ideas were primarily enforced in Germany and Austria-Hungary but not so much in France or Italy.
