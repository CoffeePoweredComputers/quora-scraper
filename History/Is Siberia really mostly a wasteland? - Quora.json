If you thought about something like this(from Google results to \u201cwasteland\u201d query):  Or, probably, like this (that\u2019s \u201cfrozen wasteland\u201d by Google):  Then no. Most places of Siberia are occupied by forest(mostly coniferous forest). It\u2019s the largest forest on the planet, Amazonia is only the second after it. This forest has its own name: Taiga. It looks like that in summer:   And like that in winter:   It doesn\u2019t look like the wasteland from above, does it? On the other hand, Taiga is a \u201cwasteland\u201d in the meaning that it is mostly uninhabited by humans, you can literally walk hundreds or even thousands of kilometers in it and never meet another human. But don\u2019t try that at home, kids. Taiga is inhabited by many nasty creatures, like these:      Again, doesn\u2019t look like wasteland to me. Update: Okay, Vyacheslav Vvedenskiy pointed out that these creatures, which also live in Taiga, are actually much nastier:    And you know\u2026 I tend to agree. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends what one defines as a \u2018wasteland\u2019. Just because most of Siberia is frozen over half the year and much of it has permafrost, doesn't necessarily make it a wasteland. Siberia is rich in natural resources but the vastness, terrain and climate make it a challenge to get to. Siberia is similar to northern Canada and northern Alaska. But parts of these areas have been developed. If those areas can do it so can Siberia. It already contains large cities and the longest rail system for such a high latitude. So no Siberia isn't a wasteland. ",
