            "answer_text": "I guess it depends on which Roman's you talk about and when . It's important to realize that when you talk about the time of Christ and shortly after this time these folks had all been trained by Christ and and his original disciples. Christians went door to door Acts 5:42 Acts 20:20 and everywhere in the marketplace and taught people the Truth about God these were the real Christians. Initially when Jesus starts this work there weren't too many of them and they weren't preaching to the Romans . They really didn't start preaching to the Romans until the year 36 with Cornelius. This is prophesied in Daniel the 9th chapter written over 600 years before . A little complicated for this forum . By the time its the year 36 there were substantially more Christians so now they become more of a thorn in the side of the Romans . So the Roman persecution grows but it was the Jews that really caused them more aggravation to the point that the Romans sieged the Jews temple and destroyed it and killed many Jews . This happened in the year 70 and Jesus had given the Christian's who were formally Jews warning in Matthew 24 and Luke 21 . So the Christians weren't there they had fled to the mountains. Paul and Luke had written that when they died off there would be ravenous wolves sneaking into the congregation . John said there were already apostates around at that time . So probably somewhere between 100-200 there weren't that many real Christians around . They started to develop a clergy class , the real Christians did not then or today have a clergy class . The organized door to door work stopped . Then comes the tricks . Some of the clergy start teaching that Jesus is God , they start teaching the immortality of the soul . Jesus Christ in the 1st century Christian congregation did not teach this but then again they are all gone by now . Here come the ravenous wolves who charge money for these lies . Jesus said not to charge people for learning about God . Matthew 10:8 . By the 4th century the Roman Empire was falling apart so Constantine in an effort to try to save his empire unites his people in a religion that he can use to control them . This is what people know as the Roman Catholic Church today. The Romans had plenty of pagan practices so in order to get those pagans to join in the Roman Catholic Church let them continue their pagan practices . I just wanted to give you a little background to the answer so you could reason on it . The short of it is when the Jehovah's Witnesses were a power to be reckoned with During the 1st century there was a time when many of the Romans hated them Matthew 10:22 . Could have also been that they wouldn't pick up arms. A Christian follows Christ , they don't do carnal warfare . By the end of the 1st century or shortly after the real Christians gave the Romans no worries because there weren't many . They had died off .JW dot org ",

            "answer_text": "For much of the first century, the Christians were thought to be merely a Jewish sect. Judaism was a permitted religion within the Empire, so as long as this idea about Christians lasted, they were free from persecution. However in 64 AD, according to Tacitus, Nero blamed the Great Fire of Rome upon the Christians as scapegoats. Saints Peter and Paul and many others were put to death, some by horrible tortures - torn apart by gladiators or wild animals in the arena, or covered in pitch and used as human torches to illuminate these spectacles (NB not in the Colosseum - that wasn\u2019t complete until 95 AD). Thereafter persecutions were sporadic. Often they were local rather than empire-wide, and depended upon the attitude of a local Governor. Some persecutions are reported towards the end of Domitian's reign (89-96). This would coincide with St John\u2019s exile on Patmos and writing of the Book of Revelation. Trajan, wrote to Pliny the younger about the treatment of Christians (c.110 AD): The authorities were not to seek Christians out, but people who were denounced and found guilty were to be punished unless, by worshipping the Roman gods, they proved they were not Christians (having denied Christ) and so obtained pardon. Anonymous denunciations were to be ignored. Hadrian (117\u2013138) stated that merely being a Christian was not enough for action against them to be taken, they must also have committed some illegal act. The philosopher emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180) seems to have taken a stricter line against Christianity. There were persecutions in the time of Septimus Severus (193\u2013211) but whether the emperor himself promoted them is up for debate. Maximinus the Thracian (r. 235-238) sent both Hippolytus (anti-pope) and Pope Pontian into exile on Sardinia, to the salt mines. In 250 the emperor Decius issued an edict, requiring everyone in the Empire (except Jews, who were exempted) to perform a sacrifice to the gods in the presence of a Roman magistrate and obtain a signed and witnessed certificate, called a libellus, to this effect. The decree was part of Decius' drive to restore traditional Roman values and there is no evidence that Christians were specifically being targeted. However it had a severe impact upon them. In the first fifteen years of his rule, 284\u2013299, Diocletian purged the army of Christians, condemned Manicheans to death, and surrounded himself with public opponents of Christianity. In 302, Galerius urged Diocletian to begin a general persecution of the Christians. Diocletian was wary, and asked the oracle of Apollo for guidance. The oracle's reply was read as an endorsement of Galerius's position, and a general persecution was called on 24 February 303. Christian churches and texts were to be destroyed, meeting for Christian worship was forbidden, and those Christians who refused to recant lost their legal rights. Later, it was ordered that Christian clergy be arrested and that all inhabitants of the empire sacrifice to the gods. Still, no specific punishment was prescribed by these edicts and local governors retained the leeway afforded to them by distance from Rome Moreover not all the Roman ruling class supported this persecution. Constantius Chlorus (father of Constantine) as one of the western emperors, refused to persecute. His son, Constantine, legalized Christianity in 313 AD (Edict of Milan). The Wiki article on Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire is very much worth reading: Before 250 AD, persecution was not empire wide; it was localized, sporadic, often mob-led, with occasional actions from local authorities. Reasons for persecution can be understood by looking at a few main areas of conflict. \"The exclusive sovereignty of Christ clashed with Caesar's claims to his own exclusive sovereignty.\" The Roman empire practiced religious syncretism and did not demand loyalty to one god, but they did demand preeminent loyalty to the state, and this was expected to be demonstrated through the practices of the state religion with numerous feast and festival days throughout the year. The nature of Christian monotheism prevented Christians from participating in anything involving 'other gods'. Christians did not participate in feast days or processionals or offer sacrifices or light incense to the gods; this produced hostility. They refused to offer incense to the Roman emperor, and in the minds of the people, the \"emperor, when viewed as a god, was ... the embodiment of the Roman empire, so Christians were seen as disloyal to both. In Rome, \"religion could be tolerated only as long as it contributed to the stability of the state\" which would \"brook no rival for the allegiance of its subjects. The state was the highest good in a union of state and religion.\" In Christian monotheism the state was not the highest good. \"Christians moved their activities from the streets to the more secluded domains of houses, shops and women's apartments...severing the normal ties between religion, tradition and public institutions like cities and nations\". This 'privatizing of religion' was another primary factor in persecution. They sometimes met at night, in secret, and this aroused suspicion among the pagan population accustomed to religion as a public event; rumors abounded that Christians committed flagitia, scelera, and maleficia\u2014 \"outrageous crimes\", \"wickedness\", and \"evil deeds\", specifically, cannibalism and incest \"wickedness\", and \"evil deeds\", specifically, cannibalism and incest (referred to as \"Thyestian banquets\" and \"Oedipodean intercourse\")\u2014 due to their rumored practices of eating the \"blood and body\" of Christ and referring to each other as \"brothers\" and \"sisters\". Edward Gibbon wrote: By embracing the faith of the Gospel the Christians incurred the supposed guilt of an unnatural and unpardonable offence. They dissolved the sacred ties of custom and education, violated the religious institutions of their country, and presumptuously despised whatever their fathers had believed as true, or had reverenced as sacred. Christianity practiced an inclusivity not found in the social caste system of the Roman empire and was therefore perceived by its opponents as a \"disruptive and, most significantly, a competitive menace to the traditional class/gender based order of Roman society\". Gibbon argued that the seeming tendency of Christian converts to renounce their family and country and their frequent predictions of impending disasters instilled a feeling of apprehension in their pagan neighbours. Much of the pagan populace believed that bad things would happen if the established pagan gods were not properly worshiped and reverenced By the end of the second century, the Christian apologist Tertullian complained about the widespread perception that Christians were the source of all disasters brought against the human race by the gods. 'They think the Christians the cause of every public disaster, of every affliction with which the people are visited. If the Tiber rises as high as the city walls, if the Nile does not send its waters up over the fields, if the heavens give no rain, if there is an earthquake, if there is famine or pestilence, straightway the cry is, \"Away with the Christians to the lions!\u201d ",
