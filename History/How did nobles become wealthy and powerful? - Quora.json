            "answer_text": "I suspect that sometime in the distant past a talented and respected member of a community was elected/chosen/volunteered as a representative or champion. The added responsibilities of the position gave him influence and a degree of wealth (as he might need to be supported in his duties by the community instead of taking part in their usual activities). As a man of some power he was given or commanded better living conditions that reflected his position. His children would probably have had access to better housing, diet etc making them healthier, and better fitted to be chosen to replace him -and so on down the generations until these descendants were divorced from the day to day grind of those they represented. The position became hereditary over time and eventually these families became formalized as \u201cthe nobles\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a very good question and one I have often puzzled over myself. For some reason, it seems to be the case in almost any civilisation that develops that a small caste of people are able to establish dominance over the rest, and end up controlling most of the resources. How do they do it? Somehow they manage to persuade the majority to stand for it. They gain control of the land and rent it out to peasant farmers who supply them with produce and labour in return (and eventually, cash). The ostensible reason in, for instance, medieval Europe is that they provide their tenants with protection. But it seems to happen everywhere. It is very mysterious. ",
