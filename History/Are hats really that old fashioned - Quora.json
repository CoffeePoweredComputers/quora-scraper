            "answer_text": "Are hats in general \u201cold fashioned?\u201d Not necessarily. However, wearing a large top hat as day wear in the 21st century is more than 100 years out of popular fashion which you likely know. It looks like a costume piece from a period drama or a fantasy tale, so of course it will garner attention, much of it negative. If you wanted to blend in, you wouldn't choose such a hat. At first glance, it reminded me of the Mad Hatter from Alice In Wonderland. I also get a period piece vibe from the second photo with what appears to be possibly a Trilby style hat and a cane with a trench coat. My father wore a similar style hat when it was a popular menswear fashion in the 1960s. However, it was worn with a more trim style of topcoat in wool or a slimmer style of rain coat and a narrow leg suit trouser. If I was choosing a hat to flatter your features, I wouldn't choose one with such a narrow brim for you. In addition, the hat looks like the size may be too small for your head. If you love hats, measure your head with a tape measure and be certain to buy hats that are the correct size to sit properly on your head in the manner that the style is designed to be worn.  The third style is currently in fashion again and is the most flattering style on you in my opinion. However, my opinion or that of anyone else is not the what matters if you want to wear anything that you like and don't care about what kind of attention it may draw. If you want to wear stylish hats that look coordinated with your clothing and modern, then I would suggest doing some research on menswear blogs and leaving the historical pieces for costume appropriate occasions. You cannot control what others think about your outward presentation, but you can control what you put on your body. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll tell you my personal opinion! I absolutely love hats, especially the sixpence, baret and Anthony Eden. People today are not used to having people around them wearing hats (at least not the traditional ones) and therefore they are obviously going to pick on the people that have a different style. The older-style hats are way more elegant than newer ones and therefore I would, any day, prefer wearing a sixpence over some weird, modern and hipster-like headwear.  A man wearing a Beret-style hat completing his look with a nice overcoat. If I\u2019m wearing a hat, I usually wear something that matches with it. This makes the look more complete and makes me feel more confident. Another thing I ask myself is this: Will I need this hat today and What is the weather like? I will only wear a hat if I need it. If I know I need my hat, I can wear it with confidence knowing that I know what I am doing. Confidence is also key to wearing your own style. I\u2019m not a big fan of top hats, I must admit that though. The only time I would be wearing that would be at a wedding in white tie. But, again, it\u2019s up to you! What do you feel like is the most practical on your way down the grocery store and what do you personally like the most? If you wear a hat and it serves a purpose I see no reason whatsoever why you should not keep doing this. If I were you I would wear a nicely selected hat with pride knowing that after all, I have better style than most! ",

            "answer_text": "No, it isn\u2019t \u201cold fashioned\u201d. It does evoke a period of greater gentility and better manners. These people have no concept of couth or refinement. Evidently they have no idea how ignorant and crude they sound. They are the symbols of a deteriorating society. I received a phone call from my haberdasher this afternoon, informing me that I would have to order my new USA-made brown Bowler and wait until August for delivery. I suggested that I pay for the hat completely and in advance instead of placing a deposit. Why? Because that\u2019s how men conduct business. Most men take care of business and make absolutely certain that any goods (within reason) are paid for prior to delivery. It is just good business and exemplifies how adults are reliable and trustworthy. I made my first purchase from this haberdasher 42 years ago. They have been a family business since 1921. This should tell you want kind of business they are. Refined, mature and as reliable as the sunrise. Are they \u201cout of date\u201d? Not on your life. The kind of people that tell you that you \u201clook stupid\u201d can use their opinions as a suppository. ",
