            "answer_text": "Yes, the least that should be made is a ban of communist symbols like nazi symbols, and an as decided \u201cnever again\u201d spoken to communist ideology as it is for the nazi one. Communism has killed more people, over longer time and in most diverse contintents, than nazism. Yet there is a tremendous confusion in terms, since many people who put their faith in some obviously inapplicapable dream, persist in keeping the error alive, that communism is not what has really been, which \u2014 with intensive beauty operations, they still accept it was evil \u2014 but communism should be some undefined dream of their minds. This is a very risky state of mind, since it is quite obvious by repetitivity, that there is something in the doctrine itself which created the dictatorships we experienced in real life. The indulgence with these mystifications is very pernicious. The situation is similar though \u2014 someone may with the same right defend fascist doctrines, and claim that they were badly applied. Yet no one does that! Are fascists more intelligent, and more capable to invent new world views, which go along with the times, while communists are static and immobilized in their illusions? ",

            "answer_text": "Should Pablo Picasso be treated like Goebbels ? Should Takiji Kobayashi be treated like Hitler ? Should Sylvia Pankhurst be treated like Goering ? Should Antonio Gramsci be treated like Himmler ? Answer is no. Parallel between Fascism and Communism is false. There were and are many Communists who oppose and continue to oppose \u2018Really Existing Socialism\u2019 of the former Eastern Bloc variety. They refused to accept the Red Bonapartism and spoke against it. Orwell, the most prominent of them. Apart from minuscule \u2018Black Front\u2019, there is no existence of National Socialists who opposed Hitler\u2019s policy, even then \u2018Black Front\u2019 did not oppose authoritarianism of the regime or it\u2019s xenophobia, only the economic policies. Nazism never was and never will be a force of progress or democracy while Classical Marxists never opposed the democracy, what they opposed was economic system. One shouldn\u2019t forget during Second International era, SPD May Day medal showed Karl Marx on one side and Statue of Liberty on another. ",
