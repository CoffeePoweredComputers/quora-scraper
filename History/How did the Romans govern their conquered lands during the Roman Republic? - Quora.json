            "answer_text": "That is honestly a question that books can and were written about. It is a very complicated subject that deals with really how Roman Empire evolved. First it is important to note that Empire didn\u2019t grow up by decree it did so organically though much conquest, and even more internal turmoil. There were huge level of debates inside Rome itself as to how properly to control none Roman lands, and even more debates on if Rome should have any non-Italian Lands at all. Therefore the first answer to your question is by saying: \u201cWhich epoch you mean\u201d? As this will alter the answer substantially. Let\u2019s start from beginning though and go through some of the basics. Rome became Italian power sometime in around 6th century BC. What that means is that she had conquered some nations, such as Etruscans, Sabine, or Volsci. However she didn\u2019t really get too much land from it. Rather she created bunch of alliances. These alliances stuck around and were pretty much foundational in rise of Rome. These people were in some cases client states, in some cases free states with certain privileges or even wholly independent states with ties to Rome. I won\u2019t go too much into this relation, but suffice to say that the major thing that Rome got was levy of soldiers and money. This allowed her to build her empire later on. It wasn\u2019t until 1st Punic war (3rd century BC) that Rome finally got her first oversea colony, which was Sicily. This was really collection of (mostly) Greek or Punic city States that inherited much from Carthage in terms of organization, and economy. It was largely focused on large Farming estates where slaves farmed for few large land owners. Sicily was more or less independent at first, with a levy of mostly grain being the price for Romes\u2026protection. In the 2nd Punic war Rome got Spain (province of Hispaniola), some African possessions. In the 3rd Punic war, Rome got some more African colonies, and of course in the series of Macedonian wars she got much of her Eastern possessions. As you can see this means roughly 200 years of different pieces of Land that were under control of Rome. So how did Rome managed all this? Again it depends on what timing. However in general here were basic structure Client State. Rome actually really liked this arrangement. She would act as an arbiter of pretty much all external and internal decisions. People would come to Rome to have their issues discussed and ruled upon. Great example of this was of course Egypt where Ptolemies would fight with each other as to who should be the ruler. They would go to Rome to have their cases heard and acted upon. Same with Numedia as another example of this. This wasn\u2019t physical conquest as such (although some of that sometimes happened after words, as in the case of Numedia or Egypt), but was non the less control over the States. That\u2019s because any major decision required Rome approval. Generally speaking Rome only threaten war if a State did something really bad. For instance when Jugurtha took over Numedian crown and killed the rightful sons of Micipsa, Rome send troops to Numedia and ended up capturing Jugurtha. Yet after words she put a puppet king on the throne and mostly just left. She didn\u2019t really control such kingdoms directly, rather she wanted certain economical concessions, such as for instance levy of Grain for cheap prices, or maybe some help with armies, such as famous Numedian cavalry.Direct control via Consul or Proconsul. Consul was a main official in Rome and was for all practical purposes a king for a year (along with his Colleague). Some Provinces, such as Sicily, would be ruled directly by the Senate, which meant Consul. Some Provinces would get their own Proconsul which was a magistrate appointed on behalf of a Consul. This people had essentially unlimited power within their provinces. They were the ultimate judge, and law giver, as well as (usually) holder of military power within their provinces. Such provinces were in a lot of ways semi-independent. Senate could, and sometimes did, issue decrees, but this war rare. Normally what happened in province stayed in province. Most provinces had to pay taxes, often via Publicanus which bid on how much taxes they would collect. How a province was treated, really depended on era and the mentality of the Proconsul. For instance, when Caesar was granted provinces of Transalpine Gaul, he had absolute power over the province. Yet the tribes therein could and did send their grievances against Caesar. Which was some of the charges that he faced from Cato.Lands controlled by Emperor. These in theory were lands that were dangerous and unstable. In practice they tended to be the richest lands. The Emperor was nominally in charge, and he appointed an official who ruled in his name. Typically such official had to be careful, as he could be held accountable if he did something that Emperor wouldn\u2019t like. These lands were nominally under control of Rome and the Senate, but in reality it was all about Emperor\u2019s will.Greek Lands. These were unique in a lot of ways. Greek lands, at least until Pontus wars or 1st century AD. Were left pretty much to themselves. This had to do with great deal of respect that Rome had for Greek culture. While certain amount of taxation, and such was enforced. For most part Rome left Greek city States more or less alone. It was ruled by local magistrates elected in a fashion of the particular city states. Any disputes were to be settled by Rome or the military Governor that was present.So above are some of the ways that Rome handled her provinces. What is important to understand that above is general overview. What actually happened within any particular province depended on the date, province, situation. There was little in a way of a strategy, and it was mostly Ad-Hoc arrangement. Some Roman officials, such as Cato the Elder, didn\u2019t believe that Rome should run any provinces herself at all, that everything should be done via client State system. Given the chaotic nature of Roman Republic, and later Roman Empire, the situation was very fluid. Rome went from treating colonies very softly, to destroying them, as she did with Corinth. This was one of the many issues with Roman Empire, it was all not really thought out. It was just series of decrees but various individuals with various ideologies and goals. To say how anything was ruled is a generic answer that has to be quantified. That said as a rule of Thumb, as long as you didn\u2019t revolt Rome tended to treat her provinces relatively well. There was a great deal of benefit, minus taxation, to be gain being part of Rome. Yet it is important to note that Rome never really became a whole. She pretty much always stayed above everybody else, and therefore there was almost always tensions within her territories. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends a lot on which one you\u2019re referring to. It\u2019s important to remember that Rome never envisaged creating an empire spanning the Mediterranean, they largely found themselves in that situation as a result of waging wars to protect their interests, not really to expand. As such, the administration of the land of vanquished foes was sort of a patchwork of treaties and specific circumstances of surrender. It all depended on how the enemy had been defeated, and how the peace had been negotiated. If a hostile nation committed to a deditio, a full surrender in which it\u2019s inhabitants were spared, they were incorporated as a Roman province, and would be governed by pro-consuls and pro-praetors. Proconsuls, and likewise pro-praetors, were those individuals who had, in the previous year (all Roman political offices had a term of one year), served as consuls/praetors in Rome. They were then dispatched to administrate the foreign holdings of Rome. This, unfortunately, encouraged a nasty habit in which Roman politicians would run up huge debts in their election campaigns, and then earn back the money by practically extorting the provinces they were assigned. This is why they were all hoping for juicy territory to squeeze. But it\u2019s important to remember that these politicians were probably not viewed as \u201cgovernors\u201d or administrators, at least not officially. If I\u2019m not mistaken, they were officially military commanders invested with imperium by the Senate. ",

            "answer_text": "Within Italy, they gave a variety of lesser rights to the conquered cities. These were later equalised after the misleadingly-named Social War (91\u201388 BC), which was against allied cities. Most of the rest of the Empire was split into Provinces with a Governor appointed by the Senate and superior to all authority within the Province. That began with Sicily. And I\u2019d suppose it was why the Republic fell, since the provinces did not support rights reserved for Italians. Caesar\u2019s army came mostly from Gaul, which he had conquered. Some outlying territories also continued as Allies, with their own Kings or lesser rulers, but still dependent. The last few rulers of the Ptolemaic Kingdom were that. ",
