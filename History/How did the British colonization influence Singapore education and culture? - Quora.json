            "answer_text": "I live in Singapore now though I am Indian by nationality. But I am perfectly qualified to answer this question of yours since I have been here for the past 6 years and I love this place. Let me tell you that the British Colonization of Singapore had such a great effect that people of different ethnic backgrounds came about to live together in a tiny fishing hamlet that was of geographical advantage to the British. What did they do to counter this? Introduced English as the universal medium of communication. Sure, One can find the vast majority looking Chinese and speaking either Mandarin, Hokkien or some other dialect but the way in the majority of the Singaporean communicate is via English.  This had a direct bearing on the education system as well. When Lee Kuan Yew decided to form the government, he prioritized on a world class education system and he did not need to look farther than the British Education system. Singapore implemented it with glee and English became the medium of instruction. The Poms surely had a major impact on the education system. When it comes to culture, it becomes a bit tricky since Singapore has always had a rich and diverse cultural heritage mainly due to the diverse ethnic background. Each group have their own cultural gatherings. The Britishers had no say, rather chose not to interfere much in this aspect since they wanted the place and labor so why mess with something which was working right? That is why culture wise a lot less Anglicism is seen. However that being said, a lot of major landmarks in Singapore have Anglicized backgrounds to them like Queenstown, Raffles Place, Dover, Cecil Street etc; all of which stemming from British influence.

            "answer_text": "If I were to be completely honest, the British influence within Singapore's system at present is close to miniscule.  That is not to imply that the British have played zero role in shaping Singapore's education, because the British did act as the catalyst for such educational development, because under Sir Stamford Raffles, the first few pioneering schools fell under three main types: Malay Schools (which was free of charge set up by the British), English Schools (not free, set up by missionaries) and Chinese/Tamil Schools (where mother tongues were mostly taught there. At best, this just created an English speaking population but there were still other foreign influences (i.e. The rise of Chinese nationalism) that had a significant foothold on Singapore's students and educators.  Furthermore, in 1947, the British set up the \"Ten Years Programme for Education Policy in the Colony of Singapore\", preparing and setting up a system that ensures that the way is paved for Singapore to set up and maintain a decent education system to cope with post-japanese occupation effects and self - governance.  Past the 1950s and 60s, the British stopped being such a significant influence,  with Singapore adapting her own \"Survival-driven education\" to equip students with the necessary skillsets as a part of the scheme to industrialise the nation and reduce unemployment.  Post-independence, the education system has been following the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew's vision of a meritocratic education system with English as the main language but placing an emphasis on sticking to one's cultural roots through learning Mother Tongue. Meritrocracy was more of a Chinese influence rather than British. However, the concept of biligualism can be argued to have been influenced by the British.  Hope I helped. :) ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest, you can find all this in the history textbooks of secondary schools in Singapore. I'll just add my two cents regarding my views in light of the time now. Education:  GCE Education System: After entering secondary education (Grade/Year 7), all of the students work towards the O- and A-level Certificate of Education. Although alternatives have been introduced, such as the IB certificate, the most widely accepted and preferred is still A-level, with IB more for art streams. This very British system has been the norm for a while and I still don't see any public demand for change. Whether this is positive or negative is for another question, but it did provide a very standardised, internationally-accepted certificate for Singaporeans to enter universities overseas. Culture: Multi-racial: The Brits can get partial credit for bringing in so many races, but they practiced the mantra of divide and conquer, which was a factor of the Maria Hertogh riots. It was a local government initiative that eventually helped to allow a peaceful multi-racial society. ",

English is required to learn for all singaporean students and all business, education institutions, government and entertainment must be published and broadcasted in english as the first priority.  British educational system based on primary and secondary school were also introduced and students must wear school uniforms even in private schools.  ",
