And they were easily detuned and stroked to make all kinds of sleeper engines in the disguise of the original 305 to the naked eye. Google the 305 being stroked all the way up to a 335. Or detuned down to a 283. 305 Engine Build Questions & Much More - Car Craft Magazine - Hot Rod How far can one bore a 305 chevy. https://www.thirdgen.org/forums/tech-general-engine/121480-283-crank-350-block.html All it takes is a pile of money and time to create a sleeping beast and a car to do it in, like an 80s Jaguar to really turn heads. But then I\u2019d go with detuned SBC 400 and a 700R4, a 4L60E, or even a TH350C tranny, then pop-in a shortened 8.5\u2033 Ford rear end with posi, or maybe a dual disk rear end from a Monte Carlo, Camaro or Corvette.

            "answer_text": "My dad and I have had\u2026. Have\u2026three 305s. One 1983 Camaro HO, one 1983 Camaro base, and one 1986 Monte Carlo SS HO. They are good mules. They do the job and can last a long time. They are not powerful. While you can upgrade them, it's a lot more effort to get performance then starting with a 350. If you are still on board: the 86 had over 186K when it was taken off the road, not due to engine problems and ran great at that time. The 1983 HO had over 160K and was running okay at the time it was pulled. The other 83 just ticked over 105K, runs good. There are LOTS of parts that fit these engines, repairs are fairly cheap. They do sound great as the other answer said. I love the way they sounded, people always THINK they sound fast. We were able to unplug the CPU on one and install a simple performance carb that allowed us to get the car running better. It was running too rich and was out of our ability/interest to figure out what wires and components were broken or what on earth the 1983 CPU was trying to react to. Pair it with a 5 speed manual and enjoy the cruise. Want to go fast or be a show off? Look some where else. ",
