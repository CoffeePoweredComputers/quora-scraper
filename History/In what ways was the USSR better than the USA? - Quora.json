            "answer_text": "Because USSR knew that numerical and technological advantage what the key not just technological. USSR up untill its collapse was Worlds most powerful country in history, in 1991 it was more powerful than US is in 2020. Lets start with history of Red army(ill count in Soviet airforce and fleet in to this). Red army was founded on 28 of January 1918 and it was fairly poorly equiped, than in 1922 Stalin came to power and completely modernized Red army up to modern standards, they could afford it because Stalin also industrialized USSR to the point where it was largest industrial power untill 1944 (when US matched it), than the Great purge, Red army was in Ruins lacking good officers and commanders, than the German army invaded on 22 of June 1941, losing so much teritory to the Germans, and up untill 1942 it was at a disadvantage, but after Stalingrad Red Army became most powerful army ever to exist with over 34 million people that served in it. Lets start with equipment. USSR produced some of the best equipment in history of warfare, now some people might say: \u201cUSSR wanted quantity over quality\u201d and thats far far from truth. When T-64 entered service with 125mm smoothbore gun US was operating old M48s and M60s, T-64 was so ahead of its time that it was better than early M1s (including M1A1 Abrams) that entered service in 1981, add to that T-72s and best tank of the cold war T-80U. Add to those tanks artillery like 2S7 Pion, 2S1 Gvozdika and many other artillery that wasnt SPG, Red army was single most powerful army to have ever existed. Soviet airforce wasnt really that powerful but they added to the power with SAM systems like S-125, S-200 and S-300, so we could say they were quite good. Soviet navy never came to like carriers even tho they had some projects like Ulyanovsk class, but they never really prioritized it, they focused on giants like Kirov class battlecruisers that were and still are unrivaled in terms of firepower, they never aimed to have massive fleets of carriers but a fleet that could take on entire Carrier battle group with small ships using Anti ship cruise missiles. Soviet union was stronger because they prefered to have numerical and technological advantage over enemies (and most of the time they had it), but they were forced because Soviets feared another invasion like one of Nazi Germany.

            "answer_text": "There was a lot of security in the fact that you knew the state would take care of you, so long as you didn\u2019t adopt any unappreciated political positions. Otherwise, you would be pretty much guaranteed a place to live, food, a job, medical care, education, and the same for your children. Maybe the quality of all of the above was less than in the west, but nobody was succumbing to starvation, suffering from unemployment, or could not afford medical care. In a capitalistic society, nothing was necessarily guaranteed. That is why, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the people who are most nostalgic are also the ones who find that their skills are less marketable, and their motivation is weak. The more skilled and well motivated Russians feel that life is better now. But we can\u2019t say that the Nanny State, which is common in Europe, and probably brought to its extreme in the USSR, is without its advantages. ",
