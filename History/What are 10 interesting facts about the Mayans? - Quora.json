Without water there would be no Maya civilization. The rock beneath the soil of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula is limestone. Over the centuries underground rivers opened several huge caverns, and many water holes. Typically the water level exists some 70 or 8o feet below the surface. They are called cenotes in Yucatec Mayan. While a few cenotes were used for human sacrifice to the rain gods, others, the majority were used for bathing and escape from the heat and insects of summer. (We can still swim in them today if there is a stairway leading down to the water level.) The sacred cenotes, such as Ik Kil [the bottom image], or the one at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, judging by the skeleton remains found in the silt at the bottom, were used for the sacrificial offering of infants, which goes along with the Meso-American iconography of rain drops being represented in the form of human babies.
