            "answer_text": "Nationalism is important because people have naturally organized themselves into groups with common interests and goals ever since the start of human civilization about 12,000 years ago, and were probably doing it even before that. People who speak the same language, share the same ethnicity or faith, or happen to be like-minded politically, or any combination of those things, might want to have their own country and a government of their choosing, which represents the things they wish to preserve, emphasize, and grow. This can happen in any number of ways, for any number of reasons: The United States of America was formed as a Republic based on the concepts of Classical Liberalism. We have generally welcomed people from all around the world who wish to help us build a nation on those principles.The State of Israel was formed as a nation-state for people of the Jewish religion and ethnicity, so they could have a safe and secure homeland.The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was founded as the world\u2019s first nation-state based on Marxist theory. When their implementation became a failed experiment after roughly 75 years, the multi-ethnic USSR broke up into various nation-states based on the ethnicity of the people in each region.Between 1859 and 1870, the various peoples of the small states that made up the Italian ethnic and linguistic community all overthrew their governments and united under one, becoming the modern nation-state of Italy.The Republic of Kosovo seceded from Serbia in 2008 on the basis of self-determination for the majority ethnic Albanian population of that region.Those are just a few examples from world history. I could go on all day and night with this. But there\u2019s one thing that needs to be noted\u2014Nationalism is NOT dying. It is stronger than ever. Kosovo is just one example. When Crimea and Sevastopol seceded from Ukraine to return to Russia, the country that its people identify with linguistically and culturally, that was Nationalism at work. Catalonia\u2019s referendum on independence from Spain, scheduled for 1 October 2017, is Nationalism at work. The Scottish independence and Brexit votes in the United Kingdom, same thing. I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019ll say it again. There are something like 204 nation-states in the modern world, counting the ones that de facto exist, but the UN pretends don\u2019t exist. In 200 years, the world will have at least 300 nation-states. The number of sovereign nation-states in the world has been rising for centuries, and it\u2019s not going to stop anytime soon. And furthermore, we shouldn\u2019t want it to stop. Let me quote from another answer of mine (John Cate's answer to Why are you a nationalist?): And even more importantly than either of those reasons is the simple fact that nationalism makes sense. Seriously, who knows what is best for France? The people of France, or people in South Korea? Who knows what\u2019s best for Japan? The Japanese, or the Spanish? But globalists don\u2019t get this simple fact. They all dream of a one-world government, but what happens when that one-world government passes regulations that don\u2019t work for some part of the world, and cause a breakdown of the economy or maybe even their entire society? Then you have the mother of all civil wars on your hands. This problem was solved back in 1648, after various differences, both religious and political, led to the ruinous Thirty Years\u2019 War (1618\u20131648), in which 40 percent of the population of Germany died, in a war that ravaged Central Europe for three decades, only to literally end in the same place that it began (Prague Castle). When the madness ended with the Peace of Westphalia, the concept of the modern nation-state was established, and has held to this day; prior to 1618, there were hundreds of semi-independent principalities that were left over from the days of feudalism, with authority in some areas but subject to some King or Emperor in others. The concept of Westphalian sovereignty guaranteed each nation its full and unfettered right to self-determination. It didn\u2019t save Europe from the likes of Frederick the Great, Louis XIV, Napoleone Buonaparte, Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler and their out-of-control militarism, but at least there was never another religious war after 1648. (I shouldn\u2019t need to explain that there are few wars worse than ones where one side is not only thoroughly convinced that they have a deity on their side, but that they\u2019re actively fighting for God\u2019s cause.) Even with all of the conflicts that have occurred since then, the era of the modern nation-state is the greatest era of human achievement. And when new nations achieve their freedom and have the chance to pursue their own national destinies, good things can happen. Look at Singapore, which became independent against its will when it was kicked out of Malaysia in 1965. Today, Singapore is a First World nation, 10th in the world in per capita GDP, with a Human Development Index that ranks fifth in the world. (Malaysia ranks 50th and 59th, respectively.) You will never see a one-world government, and if you do, it will fail and we\u2019ll just go back to Westphalian sovereignty, probably after billions of people die to re-establish it. The route to world peace isn\u2019t through the silly idea that \u201cthe world will live as one,\u201d it\u2019s through self-determination for all of the nations of the world, including those currently under unwanted foreign overlordship. When we get there, the world will have an opportunity to live\u2014each nation according to their desires, in cooperation with others if they wish, or apart from others if they prefer that. Only then can there be any chance at lasting peace. ",

            "answer_text": "Man is a social animal by nature because he is weak as a single being.Being in groups and tribes gives him more strength and power for survival. With the advent of civilization man becomes more and more organized in terms of society. First there is a unit of family,families turn into tribes,tribes into more bigger tribes and this organization goes on. The strength of a civilization lies in how much well organized it is as a society. In pre modern times the biggest organized entity of a society was nothing more then an advanced form of a tribe. The monarchies and empires consisted of a number of tribes from few to hundreds in case of huge empires. The monarchs and emperors whole politics was around managing and harnessing this power of the tribes. Feudalism was an advanced form of it. Although people did not belong to same family tree or race area etc but they were basically loyal to there Lords and Barons. These Lords and Barons were then under the King. This form of government was inefficient as a whole because it lead to revolts and disorder in the long run. It was difficult for a King to manage the Lords in an effective way for common interests. The idea of nationalism in the Modern era solved this problem very effectively. The idea to make people loyal to the central government with their whole heart on the basis of race created a nation. Nations were more organized and more efficient in action because they used the physical power as well as the soul of the people to drive the wheels of a united country. No ancient form of monarchy could stand in there way. One of the reasons the west was so successful in colonizing huge empires such as the Mughal and the Ottoman empire was this national spirit. The empires stood no chance because although they had huge armies but they had no cohesive force inside them to counter this nationalism. The reason China and especially Japan bore the burnt of this nationalism way better was because they were already in a semi-organized state, a nation. The History of the colonial era looks like the survival of the fittest where a beasts rise from the ashes of the the Papacy to prey on all the weaker animals and old weak beasts on the face of Earth. After they are finished feasting and there is no more prey in sight they start feasting on each other :) and that starts the first World War. The idea of nation state is old now and World is looking forward for Global culture i.e A kind of a super Nation. The American new world order is the next step in this direction. ",
