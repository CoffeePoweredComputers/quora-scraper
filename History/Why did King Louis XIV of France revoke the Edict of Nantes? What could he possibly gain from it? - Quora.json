            "answer_text": "When Henry IV issued the Edict of Nantes, the reason was simple - there had been so much bickering and conflict between he Huguenots and Catholics that it was tearing apart his Kingdom. The Huguenots has virtually established a \u201cstate within a state,\u201d complete with entire fortifications. Massacres like the one on St. Bartholomew\u2019s Day in 1572 were destroying the unity of his nation. The Wars of Religion had plagued France, and had turned into a nearly foreign war. England and the Dutch supported the Protestants, while the Pope and Spain funded the Catholics. Internal strife was dominant in France. Henry III sought to encourage religious harmony, and was assassinated by a Catholic fanatic for this in 1589. The situation was bad.  (St. Bartholomew\u2019s Day Massacre) When Henry IV ascended to the throne, his power was being undermined by the various factions fighting. Despite being raised a Protestant, Henry IV converted to Catholicism. He needed to repair the internal strife of his country \u2014 the Edict of Nantes was successful in doing this, and for a short time, it showed that religious harmony could be alright. But the populace of France was still divided between Catholics and Huguenots, and both factions disliked each other and viewed each other as heretics. There was a great deal of resentment, and the Edict had been accepted only begrudgingly. That\u2019s never a good sign. When Louis XIV \u201cthe Sun King\u201d came to power, he had been born and raised in the Catholic faith. The Huguenots had already lost their military power; this had been removed in 1629. Louis shared the view that Protestants were heretics - this was encouraged by his wife, a very pious woman who held the common view of her time that Protestantism was a heresy. The revocation was a culmination of events though; Louis first sought to convert the Protestants to Catholicism. This was unsuccessful though: so he made life for Protestants miserable and practically segregated them, preventing them from marrying to Catholics and refusing to let them hold powerful positions. He created the dragonaddes, who terrorized Protestants in France and were legally allowed to loot at will. Louis\u2019 issuing of the Edict of Fontambleau in 1685 was a culmination of things. Louis wanted religious unity in his Kingdom, and for him, it was necessary to drive out all religious minorities. He also probably wanted to appease the Catholic Church, whom he had fallen out of favor with. But the Edict of Fontambleau was not a good decision - politically and morally. The forced migration of Protestants was terrible and horrific, and Louis was unable to realize that other kingdoms would quickly jump at the chance. His Edict put him on hostile terms with the Dutch and English, resulted in the loss of many of France\u2019s great minds, and set back religious freedom in France by a century. It was a stupid thing to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Why did King Louix XIV revoke the Edict of Nantes? Bigotry. What could he gain? The same every bigot does: get rid of people he regarded as undesirable. Louis XIV had married Mme. de Maintenon in a secret second marriage. She was a virulent Catholic bigot who hated the \u201cheretics\u201d (Protestants). Whether under her influence or because of his own turn to fanatical Catholicism, he became a bigot himself. Eventually, he got convinced that the \u201cheretics\u201d should either convert (by force if necessary) or kicked out of his kingdom. In his mind, it was the right thing to do, just like in Hitler\u2019s mind it was the right thing to kill Jews. Nothing rational about it. Consequently, the revocation lead to a campaign of ethnic cleansing which depopulated entire regions of France, to its great detriment, and provided its enemies with entire population of hard-working, educated people. It\u2019s telling that the General in charge of the German headquarters in WW1 was one by the name of Francois. Yes, the descendant of a Huguenot. ",
