You are still a hunter gatherer. If you live in the USA, you have gone from the agrarian age to the space age during that same time period. Our minds and bodies still have not caught up withthe changes. ",

            "answer_text": "Over the past five hundred years, developments in military, economic and social technologies made possible by time and energy spared from food gathering by the prior development of agriculture have served as catalysts for the destructive force of an already burgeoning human population. Now that population has already outpaced the resources on which it relies for its existence, and, as it completes its program of devastating the earth through greenhouse gas emissions, it careens toward its own demise - or at least system-failure - meanwhile debating whether that crisis is actually real enough that it should take some serious actions to avoid it. To my way of thinking Climate Change is not a red light up ahead. In deep time, we have already run the light and the crash is but a breath or two away. If you relax you are less likely to be ruined - as is already highly likely - than if you brace. Perhaps. Seen any good movies, lately? \ud83d\ude02 ",

We have proper sanitation which largely eliminates cholera, diphtheria, the plague, dysentery and diseases that are borne from sewage and dirty water. There\u2019s better sexual health due to contraception. There is a more acute understanding of medical issues per se therefore our general nutrition, well-being and mental health is far better than five hundred years ago. We have smartphones that can tell you any tidbit of information from the last 3000 years (as opposed to tablets or scrolls) or play any piece of music ever created. In short you got it pretty good, if you ever master that flux capacitor make sure you can get back!! ",
