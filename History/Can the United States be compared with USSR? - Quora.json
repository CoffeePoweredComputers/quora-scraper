            "answer_text": "Absolutely. The both of them can be compared, even today largely. Here are similarities between the 2: Cover-ups: Nope, this isn\u2019t a uniquely USSR thing. The USA did engage in cover-ups of fuck ups that the US did. Operation Paperclip, our arming of the Mujahideen, etc, were not known to the public until after the Cold War. Many false flags by the US government were also not revealed to the public until recently either.Demands for nationalism & loyalty among their populations: Both nations demanded that their citizens remain loyal to their governments & not to question the actions of their governments. Although, the USSR was undoubtedly much more authoritarian, the US did engage in some authoritarian tactics such as limiting the freedom of speech of anyone to the left of the political spectrum & spying on Dr. MLK Jr. for supposedly being a Communist. The SU had the KGB & very harsh persecution towards political dissidents. As a result of their nationalism, they were very xenophobic & wanted to mold the world in their own ways.Support for authoritarian regimes & overthrowing of democratically elected governments to install dictators that were loyal to them: Yes, both the US & the SU did use military force (either through the CIA/KGB, soft power or blatant hard power) to quell governments in the 3rd world they didn\u2019t like so that they could install dictators that were loyal to them. Generally, the US was more secretive about this than the SU was & it usually wasn\u2019t as blatant & in your face as the SU, but it still happened nonetheless.Imperialism & Empires. Yes, both were & still are empires. They wanted to gain as much control over the world as possible so that they can expand their influence & gain natural resources. The both of them just didn\u2019t do in the the fashion that it was done by European empires & Japan pre WWII. This is why the US supported & gave military aid to the Military Junta Guatemala for example.Tried to do good for their populations: Yes, both did & attempted to do good for their populations & their allies\u2019 citizens. Both the US & the SU did provide very decent government services towards their citizens & both had lots of job creation & job security, as well as a lot of leisure time, high fertility rates, decent housing, stability, etc. For the US we can point to the Interstate highway system, growing middle class & high disposable income, the Martial Plan for their European & East Asian allies, high socioeconomic mobility & so on. For the USSR, we can point to virtually no unemployment, high amounts of free time, having your basic necessities met, public transportation, decent healthcare for everyone, sense of community & cooperation, fast industrialization & decent retirement packages. Both sides had really good things to teach each other & I think that it\u2019s sad that they were very tribalistic in their outlook.I think that these 5 points do summarize the things that both the USA & the SU/Russia have in common. In this answer, I was very nuanced by calling out the bullshit from both sides while praising the positives from both sides. In addition, I do want to bring up US backing of Wahhabism & Salafism during the Cold War to fight against Communism & how that turned out. It didn\u2019t turnout very good @ all & the Soviets were actually correct that Wahhabism & Salafism were a much worse threat than they were. Even today, looking back, I actually prefer the Soviet threat over the Wahhabi threat as the Soviets had some decent selling points (better women\u2019s rights, attempting to build decent living standards for everyone & high emphasis on science & technology) while Wahhabism has nothing but regressive & extreme religious dogma that completely flies in the face of modern day Western values. I also think it\u2019s unfortunate & very shameful that both nations don\u2019t often teach the wrongdoings of their Cold War past & still want to their Cold War era propaganda into their children\u2019s heads. As an American, I am often times appalled that our education system doesn\u2019t teach about Operation Condor, US backing & propping up of Wahhabism, putting down pro Soviet/anti US governments & revolutions, US support of authoritarian & totalitarian regimes & police states such as Augusto Pinochet, the National Reorganization Process, the Guatemalan Military Junta & 1st - 4th Republics of South Korea, as well as the fact that the US did cover-up some of the atrocities & fuck ups, as well as false flags by the US government, especially by the CIA. By the same token, Russian/Soviet authorities have swept Stalin\u2019s Purges, KGB use of psychiatric torture, ethnic cleansing of Tatars, Ukrainians, Poles, Central Asians & pretty much anyone else who wasn\u2019t a white ethnic Russian who was loyal to Stalin, abuse the LGBT, Jewish, & other minority communities under the Soviet regime & abuses under the KGB & the Stasi in East Germany.

            "answer_text": "Both were superpowers. Both came out as victors after WWII. Both were immensely powerful. Both had a high degree of technological advancement and development. Both were extremely influential, particularly in their spheres. However, they went about things in a different way. The USA, while it certainly used a lot of hard power, also relied on its soft power, which it had much more of as compared to the USSR. Why was the Berlin Wall built? Because one of the easiest ways to defect from East Germany into West Germany was by hopping across the Inner German Border, which was originally a painted white line. I think this photo of it is very interesting:  The woman on the left has just made it across the line. But the very interesting part is the weaponry that the guards on both sides of the line are holding. As you can see, the West German guards are brandishing pistols. The East German ones are holding rifles. Pistols are typically used for close-encounter situations. Rifles are better suited to sniping. Who do you suppose they were sniping at? They couldn\u2019t be shooting at the West German guards - this could potentially start WWIII. They were sniping at people like the woman to prevent them from escaping across the border. (This is why she\u2019s on her hands and knees - she\u2019s probably in shock at not being dead.) Escapes like this were destabilizing both East and West Germany, so you ended up with the Berlin Wall in an attempt to frustrate the runs. Notably, according to the Berlin Wall memorial: Berlin Wall Memorial | The Berlin Wall | Fatalities all of the fatalities due to attempts to breech the wall were runs from East to West. What does this have to do with the USA and the USSR? Soft power. While there were indeed double agents and defections among Western-influenced people, this was not a huge concern. Many more people were interested in defecting from East to West as opposed to vice versa. While the USA was indeed involved in areas where the Cold War got hot - Korea, Vietnam - it\u2019s notable that this was different than what the USSR was doing under what would eventually be called the Brezhnev Doctrine. The USA never went around and put down revolutions in its own sphere. Meanwhile, the USSR put down an uprising in East Germany in 1953; it put down one in Hungary in 1956; it invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968. Essentially, the Cold War was not ultimately a measure of capitalism\u2019s triumph over communism; it was a measure of honey gathering more flies than vinegar. Many countries that ended up under the umbrella of the Eastern Bloc, for instance, wanted to accept Marshall Plan aid, but the USSR blocked it. Tons of Warsaw Pact members didn\u2019t want to be part of the USSR: talk to a Pole about Western Betrayal. They\u2019ll tell you all about it. It\u2019s not as if the USA had squeaky clean hands throughout this process, either. The Bay of Pigs was a disaster; Vietnam was lost; McCarthyism is nothing to go around being proud of. Yes. You can compare the USA and the USSR. In fact, it\u2019s functionally necessary to in order to understand the political and social situations that ended up with the USSR\u2019s collapse. ",

Instead, I will share a bit of my personal experience. It took me two years to get exit visas for me, my wife and my baby daughter. Those two years were not the happiest years of my life to say the least, but I was lucky: for some people it took much longer, and some never got them. During my first couple of years in the United States, I used to wake up in the middle of the night, disoriented by darkness, and lie there thinking, \u201cWhat a wonderful dream it was! Had they let me go, it could\u2019ve been my reality.\u201d It took a conscious effort before I could recall that the evil \u201cthey\u201d had let me go and my life was not a dream. Yes, the United States and the Soviet Union can be compared. ",

            "answer_text": "Russia was strongly influenced by Ottoman culture. They had to take a turn to the West when the Ottoman empire became weaker. The US was another western European country, just a bit farther off and more open to immigration. Russia is strongly xenophobic and the US weakly. Russians like spices and vinegars. They like drinking. In the US it is less important. In the US the food is bland like in England unless it is called ethnic. The US is used to larger living spaces though they are getting smaller. As a result of taking in lots of groups there is a different kind of pride in being American. Russians have an older culture and are proud of the soil beneath their feet and where they and their ancestors are from. Americans put great value on manners. Russians put great value on being true to your friends and family. They have a cult of motherhood which we lack. They are very corrupt and that has kept them in poverty. We are less corrupt but still have problems with a middle class now in the minority and the rich getting richer at our expense. There is little representation of middle class and poor interests at present in both countries. We both interfered in the world we both had unforeseen consequences. Putin has announced they have no more money for foreign interventions as the price of oil is low. The US has learned to intervene only when our own interests are at stake. Vietnam and the Dominican Republic are unlikely events as is the Cuban missile crisis. Both are having financial problems but the standard of living in Russia is much worse. ",
