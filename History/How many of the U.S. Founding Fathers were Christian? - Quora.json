            "answer_text": "This is a question that people are tempted to answer based on their current view of religiously-inspired laws. If you're from the Left, you emphasize the deism of the founders and their opposition to the establishment of religion. You quote Franklin, Jefferson, or Tom Paine.  Franklin is often misquoted as saying \"lighthouses are more helpful than churches.\" What he actually wrote after narrowly surviving a shipwreck was this: \"The bell ringing for church, we went thither immediately, and with hearts full of gratitude, returned sincere thanks to God for the mercies we had received: were I a Roman Catholic, perhaps I should on this occasion vow to build a chapel to some saint, but as I am not, if I were to vow at all, it should be to build a light-house.\" Jefferson's \"wall of separation\" is often cited, but when you read it in full, he sounds a lot more religious than one might expect: \"Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. \" Now, to be sure, Tom Paine was unequivocally anti-religion. In fact, he sounds really modern: \"The most detestable wickedness, the most horrid cruelties, and the greatest miseries that have afflicted the human race have had their origin in this thing called revelation, or revealed religion. It has been the most destructive to the peace of man since man began to exist. Among the most detestable villains in history, you could not find one worse than Moses, who gave an order to butcher the boys, to massacre the mothers and then rape the daughters. One of the most horrible atrocities found in the literature of any nation. \" ... but even he wasn't an atheist. The above quote continues this way: \"I would not dishonor my Creator's name by attaching it to this filthy book.\" If you're from the Right, you find pro-Christian quotes from founders like Hamilton. Here is his take on the French revolution: \"Facts, numerous and unequivocal, demonstrate that the present \u00c6RA is among the most extraordinary which have occurred in the history of human affairs. Opinions, for a long time, have been gradually gaining ground, which threaten the foundations of religion, morality, and society. An attack was first made upon the Christian revelation, for which natural religion was offered as the substitute. The Gospel was to be discarded as a gross imposture, but the being and attributes of GOD, the obligations of piety, even the doctrine of a future state of rewards and punishments, were to be retained and cherished.In proportion as success has appeared to attend the plan, a bolder project has been unfolded. The very existence of a Deity has been questioned and in some instances denied. The duty of piety has been ridiculed, the perishable nature of man asserted, and his hopes bounded to the short span of his earthly state. DEATH has been proclaimed an ETERNAL SLEEP; \"the dogma of the immortality of the soul a cheat, invented to torment the living for the benefit of the dead.\" Irreligion, no longer confined to the closets of conceited sophists, nor to the haunts of wealthy riot, has more or less displayed its hideous front among all classes.\" Now, the truth is that on this as on many other subjects, the founders were not a monolithic bloc. Overall, though, they were a lot more religious and the Left would admit, but less so than the Right would like to believe. But on this as on many other subject, we either project our own opinions onto the blank canvas than they have become or we see them as proto-versions of ourselves. ",

            "answer_text": "When it comes to the Founding Fathers and religion, there\u2019s always a debate. Some insist they were Christians. Others refute the possibility, stating many were too influenced by the Enlightenment and were therefore deists. The truth of the matter falls somewhere in between. See, the Founding Fathers were a heterogeneous group. But they had similarities. They were gentleman. They were well educated. And, for the most part, they were wealthy. If colonial America would have had an aristocracy, the Founding Fathers would have been a part of it. And as such, many of them studied religion. They studied philosophy. And they had leisure time in which to ponder the merits and logic of both. The fact is most of the Founding Fathers believed in some level of Christian Deism. To the great men who started our Nation, this meant: They believed in God, as in a higher being and creatorThey believed in Jesus\u2019 teachingsThey didn\u2019t necessarily believe that God interfered in daily human lifeThey believed that reason lead to the belief in GodThey were freethinkers, in that they rejected the ideas others, including Church doctine, tried to force on themThey believed in religious freedomPerhaps this is the most important aspect of the Founding Father\u2019s beliefs, the idea of religous freedom. Religion is a private affair between every man and his Maker, and no tribunal or third party has a right to interfere between them. It is not properly a thing of this world; it is only practiced in this world; but its object is in a future world; and it is not otherwise an object of just laws than for the purpose of protecting the equal rights of all, however various their belief may be. ~Thomas Paine And Paine wasn\u2019t the only one to write on religious freedom. The subject of religion, a subject on which I have ever been most scrupulously reserved, I have considered it as a matter between every man and his maker, in which no other, and far less the public had a right to inter-meddle. ~Thomas Jefferson Here it\u2019s easy to see both Paine\u2019s and Jefferson\u2019s philosophy of religious freedom along with their belief in a creator. And while that doesn\u2019t signify that either were Christians, Jefferson identifies as such, talking of his own beliefs in Jesus: It is a document in proof that I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus, very different from the Platonists, who call me infidel, and themselves Christians and preachers of the gospel, while they draw all their characteristic dogmas from what its Author never said nor saw. They have compounded from the heathen mysteries a system beyond the comprehension of man, of which the great reformer of the vicious ethics and deism of the Jews, were he to return on earth, would not recognise one feature. ~Thomas Jefferson See, it\u2019s not that the Founders were against religion. No, they were against a state religion and they were against being forced into believing in a specific dogma. For some, they distrusted organized religion with the same principles that lead to their distrust of an over zealous government. A distrust of anything that impeded on freedom. We should begin by setting conscience free. When all men of all religions \u2026 shall enjoy equal liberty, property, and an equal chance for honors and power \u2026 we may expect that improvements will be made in the human character and the state of society. ~John Adams So were the Founding Fathers Christian? Yes, but in a progressive way. They used reason to deduct that God must exist. They believed in the teachings of Jesus, but not the construct of organized religion. But they didn\u2019t believe that any religion, even their own, should be forced upon anyone.  Want to know more about what the Founding Fathers thought of religion?
