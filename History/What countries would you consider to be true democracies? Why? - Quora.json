However, either way those examples apparently are probably the best countries out there as they are very free, democratic, and have good economies. ",

            "answer_text": "I would consider being true democracies those countries that are ranked by the EIU's Democracy Index as 'Full Democracies'. Why? Because those 'nations have only limited problems in democratic functioning', whereas other democracies have more flaws. Some mentioned the UK and Switzerland, and those two countries are indeed ranked as full democracies alongside 20 other countries (and no, the United States is not one of them). Somebody said that democracy is a flawed idea. Yes, it is! But is there any idea that does not have some sort of flaw? That is why I like the definition of a full democracy when it says that it has only limited problems, etc. Which country is considered to be the top democracy in the world? The answer is Norway.  ",
