            "answer_text": "Before we discuss anything lets see some facts about Chanakya: 1. Chanakya is considered as extremely cunning and shrewd politician. He is also known as one of the earliest economists of ancient India. 2. Ashwin Sangi wrote a book known as Chanakya\u2019s Chant in which Sangi claims that it was Chanakya who was responsible for uniting entire nation when India was attacked by Alexander the Great. 3. One of the most interesting of Chanakya facts is that Chanakya\u2019s views on women were not really great. Those views might have been accepted in ancient times but in modern times, they are considered as disgusting views. According to him, women are not trustworthy for they have corrupt and vile nature. 4. If that\u2019s not enough, here is another view that Chanakya held \u2013 a woman can attain purity only if she drinks the water that has been used for cleansing or washing the feet of her husband. She can never attain such purity by drinking holy water or observing fasts or even offering charity. 5. Chanakya\u2019s views about an ideal wife were a bit twisted too. According to him, an ideal wife should have the following characteristics: In the morning, she should be serving her husband like a mother serves her son.In the noon, she should be \u2018loving and caring\u2019 towards her husband like a sister is to her brother.In the night she should be able to please her husband the way a prostitute please a man.No wonder, these views do not really resonate in today\u2019s world and are considered as crippled and twisted thoughts. 6. It is said that Chanakya was so intelligent that he had a solution to every problem that showed up. It is also said that apart from being a pioneer economist and a politician, he even achieved the knowledge of astronomy and medicine. 7. According to many historians, Chanakya was born in 350 BCE and that he had a very manipulative nature that helped in the formation of Maurya Dynasty \u2013 one of the largest dynasties ever known in ancient India. Based on the information above we can say that he was a man of great mind and he was more advanced than the respective time. His policies might be apt for the ancient time but in the present era some of them sounds bizzare. A person of his calibre would have been successful in politics for sure. If not completely then to most extent you can compare Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and in current time Amit Shah with Chanakya (except the pov for women). Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel ji united the whole Indian contituencies after the Independence. It requires lot of patience, diplomacy, sharp mind, advanced thoughts to do such a huge task within minimum time expenditure. Currently Amit Shah has been doing same in a different way. He is the Think Tank of BJP. His strategies whether in Delhi, Haryana, J&K, Uttar Pradesh or in Goa and Manipur has put BJP in lead. In Goa and Manipur, BJP made goverment despite losing the elections. This is possible due to his focused strategies, sharp mind and forsightedness. This can be assumed that Chanakya, if existed today, would have been a pillar in politics which would be very difficult to even shake let alone move it. Although it is doubtful that he would have been able to rule a nation since being a leader requires different qualities. You should be able to make people follow you blindly and this kind of character would get more of enemies rather than followers. Some due to enemity, some due to jealousy. I hope I am making sense and you have got your answer. Thanks for asking the question. Good luck. KY ",
