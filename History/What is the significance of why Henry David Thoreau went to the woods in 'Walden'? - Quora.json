            "answer_text": "Going against the grain, but with the historical facts. Short answer: The episode of Thoreau\u2019s stay at Walden Pond produced a literary work of political philosophy so profound that it reached out to the pacifist minds of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., more than a century later, and it helped to build the bono fides of antiwar sentiment on America\u2019s college campuses and among its university faculties. Gandhi adopted some of these ideas and recommended the study of Thoreau\u2019s Civil Disobedience to all his followers. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote of Thoreau, \u201cHere, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance.\u201d[i]  [i] Martin Luther King, Jr. Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr. Accessed October 2008. URL: http://www.stanford.edu/group/King//publications/autobiography/chp_2.htm The Mexican War (1846-1848) was wildly popular with the electorate, but it generated the first truly intellectual justification of antiwar principles in America through the pen of Henry David Thoreau. It also brought forth two other significant antebellum concepts: Transcendentalism and Manifest Destiny. Thoreau \u2014 a Harvard alumnus, ex-schoolteacher, poet, essayist, and sometime recluse \u2014 had begun his solitary stay at Walden Pond just as President Polk was entering the White House. The property around the pond, which was only a short walk from his aunt\u2019s home, belonged to Ralph Waldo Emerson who had given his friend free use of it, and Thoreau built a shack near the water\u2019s edge in which to live. During his stay Thoreau was no hermit in sackcloth and ashes. Nor was his life \u201cSpartan-like\u201d except in his own mind. His aunt and female cousin often visited him there, brought him meals and baked goods, and took away his dirty laundry to be cleaned. Although the facts surrounding Thoreau seem incongruous to the themes of individual freedom, resistance to government, and civil rights that he set in motion, a few of his contemporaries recognized in him an important nexus in the conflict between expansionism and antislavery. Thoreau helped set in motion a new antiwar movement, the first since the Federalists in New England had protested and failed to avoid the War of 1812, but one that had an intellectual as well as a political conscience.[i] The Mexican War of 1846, in particular, had not been popular in the Northern elitist circles engendering vehement antiwar resentment among outspoken abolitionists like Wendell Philips, Henry Ward Beecher, and William Lloyd Garrison. Although a simple and somewhat quixotic man, Thoreau\u2019s essay \u201cOn Civil Disobedience\u201d (1849) was written to protest the use of tax money to prosecute the Mexican War, a conflict he considered unjust and blatantly aggressive. Thoreau believed the purpose of the war was to extend American slavery into new territories at the expense of its weaker neighbor \u2014 the first great iteration of Manifest Destiny, a term coined in 1845 by a New York newspaperman John L. O\u2019Sullivan in the United States Magazine and Democratic Review . Although the money paid to his local magistrate was not actually being spent on the war, by refusing to pay his poll taxes, Thoreau had protested the concept of war funding and was hauled off to jail. His aunt quietly paid his poll taxes, and Thoreau was released after spending a single night in the local lock-up sharing a cell with a man accused of setting fire to a barn. \u201cIt was like traveling into a far country, such as I had never expected to behold, to lie there for one night,\u201d wrote the sometimes overly melodramatic author. No one took notice of the incident at the time save Ralph Waldo Emerson, James Russell Lowell, Margaret Fuller, and a small circle of relatives and friends, among them the group of writers and intellectuals known as the Transcendentalists. Emerson observed of the incident, \u201cMy friend Mr. Thoreau has gone to jail rather than pay his taxes. On him they could not calculate.\u201d [ii] The Transcendentalists, who practiced a form of Christian humanitarianism at Brook Farm in Massachusetts, were both anti-slavery and anti-business. Today they would probably be classed as social democrats. They had an effect on the intellectual development of New England out of all proportion to their number, which totaled no more than a few dozen persons. Mostly their importance resides in their \u201cnear deification\u201d by generations of liberal university instructors (and writers of Antebellum histories). Theodore Parker, Margaret Fuller, and (Amos) Bronson Alcott spent time there, and Ralph Waldo Emerson supplied funds to the failing commune in the last year of its existence. The group had coalesced around the rising social religion known as Unitarianism. In 1831, a devotee described Unitarianism as being nothing more than the spirit of freedom and individuality with no established creed or symbol, its members aiming for the social harmony of earth with mankind. The purposes of the Mexican War, as the Transcendentalists perceived them, were the antithesis of the spirit of the Utopian community that they had formed. In American Notes, English author Charles Dickens, who made a much-touted visit to America in 1842, noted the \u201cgood healthy qualities\u201d of the group. \u201cIf I were a Bostonian, I think I would be a Transcendentalist.\u201d On the surface, some traditional ways of living out a proper Christian lifestyle could appear very appealing to traditional Transcendentalists. If confronted with both a Thoreau at Walden Pond and a Christian hermit in the Judean Holy Land, outsiders would immediately notice the similarity of simplicities. As a Unitarian, however, Thoreau found organized religion as threatening as authoritarian governance. He would have viewed the traditional Christian Churches with the suspicion that, like government, they existed to reign in the human spirit.

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question can be found at the end of Walden by Henry David Thoreau. I guess you did not read too closely, or you chose to not finish the book. Thoreau says, I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms. Thoreau desire to experience life and it's meaning by living by the most simple terms possible. He lived off of the land. He built his own house. He hunted and fished his own food. He lived in solitude. Through these things, Thoreau experienced how life truly is truly meant to be lived. He desired to live a mindfully rich life, rather than a monetarily rich life, and to do that he had to prove that living off of the most base means is not only possible, but worthwhile. Nature, to Thoreau, was beautiful, rich, alive, and helpful. It provided him with all the aesthetic beauty and material goods that he could ever desire. From walking through the woods to taking his raft out and chasing ducks, he spent all of his time outdoors, fully immersing himself in the natural world; for that was where he was truly alive. He pitied those who felt not the desire but the need for luxurious material goods. He wrote the book not to get others to follow in his footsteps and live a year in the woods, he was simply showing that it is important for one to follow their heart and find meaning in their lives. He even says that the book was not meant to act as an instruction book for people, it was for people to brainstorm to find ways to find life like he did. Finally, Thoreau was not interested in working his life away. He says that people who work day in and day out are \u201cmachines,\u201d who have found themselves trapped in life that is fruitful in works but barren in happiness and life. For Thoreau, life is meant to be lived\u2014 not worked. He worked for six weeks to save up enough money to buy supplies to live for a year in the woods. I believe his total expenses came out to 28 dollars. Endless toil is not living. Thoreau desired to live. I am about 6 months removed from reading Walden, so I apologize if some minutiae are incorrect. There are certainly other reasons as to why Thoreau wrote this book but these were the major ones I could come up with. If you have not already, I would highly suggest reading Thoreau\u2019s other works, such as; Civil Disobediance and Walking. Source for quote from book: A quote from Walden ",
