            "answer_text": "A2A. Thanks for the truly interesting question! I\u2019m sure no one thought, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s make a movie with no women in it.\u2019 It\u2019s simply a reflection of what happens when a project, and in this case an entire industry, are dominated by one point of view. The film industry has always been, and continues to be, dominated by men. We know that diversity behind the camera leads to diversity on screen. But a look at the crew list for Lawrence of Arabia reveals that, while there were women in traditionally female jobs like Costume Designer, Casting Director, and in this case also Editor, the writers, producers, executives, and director were all male (and white, which is relevant given the overall whiteness of the cast of a film is set in the Middle East.) There are those who will argue that any movie about war or an adaptation of a book that largely excludes women is bound to be predominantly male\u2026 as though women are not affected by war or were not an important part of Lawrence\u2019s life. But those very arguments support considering and understanding how much of what we see is a direct result of who chooses which stories get told and how. I love Lawrence of Arabia. I love lots of male-dominated movies. If male-dominated casts were a dealbreaker, it would be next to impossible to be a movie fan. But I also understand that I can love a movie while recognizing its problematic context, and this is a great example. ",

            "answer_text": "I would argue that a less catchy, but more accurate title for the movie could have been \u201cLarry and his complicated relationship with toxic masculinity.\u201d I really think that this captures what the film makers were going for. As such, having no women is a reasonable and interesting artistic choice. Think about the Lord of the Flies, for example. It is a story that would be difficult to tell with mixed genders. It has nothing to say about gender relations or roles. And given the short time to tell a story in the movies and the symbolic nature of everything in the story, any choice for an individual character would be a statement about gender roles. If Piggy was is a girl and Jack was a boy it would say something different than if the roles were reversed. It is a story that genuinely needs to be told with a single gender. (As an asside, the idea of doing it with girls is great, hopefully they do a good job. ) Of course it is possible that in Lawrence of Arabia they just forgot about women as was common back in the day (you know, before last Tuesday). But since the movie is so very, very well thought out otherwise and having no women can be thought of as an artistic choice I think we should give them the benefit of the doubt. Certainly, there are many movies with worse sins. We don't even have to go back 50 years to find them. ",
