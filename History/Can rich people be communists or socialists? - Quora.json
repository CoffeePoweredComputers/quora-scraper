            "answer_text": "Yes. Being rich does not lock you into a certain frame of possible opinions. A rich person can hold any opinion, including being a socialist or even a communist. Rich people are less likely to be socialists or communists though, as it\u2019s exceptionally difficult, if not impossible, to become rich without exploiting the working class. If you\u2019re someone who\u2019s benefitted greatly from exploiting the working class, you\u2019re naturally less likely to consider exploiting the working class to be oppressive. ",
