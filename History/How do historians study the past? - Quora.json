            "answer_text": "We read a lot\u2026 an awful lot. We usually read everything. We're inquisitive by nature\u2026 which is a way of saying we are obsessively nosey. Historians don't just \u201cknow stuff\" but in fact, assume they do - or potentially could - know nothing about the subject. It could all change with one fresh piece of evidence. The quest is always to find out the truth, as devoid of opinion or bias as possible, and to find, compare and evaluate every shred of evidence there is. It is always the conviction that there's possibly something you've missed, that keeps us keen, keeps us awake at night, and keeps us asking. My own history work is driven by \u201cNobody knows\u201d. The second I find something in a book which is unknown, and which can't be answered by my extensive library or the internet, I start to get cranky. If I'm still cranky four days later, I will probably end up writing a book about it. Here's an example (I already feel this is going to be a long one): Hannibal's first battle, on the river Tagus in 220BC is one which was completely unknown. There are two accounts (Livy and Polybius) which are not even a page long and which disagree in places. Nobody knew where it was, and without that, you can't even work out what happened. Nobody knew, and it was a blank space in history\u2026 it drove me crazy. Various accounts put it anywhere from the very start of the Tagus down almost as far as Portugal, and it is 1,000km long, of which all we are told is that Hannibal was returning from a campaign in the north west and returned to Cartagena, turning to fight the Spanish tribes on the river, using a convex meander as a force multiplier. The Tagus has endless meanders, there are nine credible proposed sites (about fifty not credible) and at least six different versions of the battle, based upon largely nothing but guesswork, assumption and hearsay. One of these places is still considered as \u201cThe one\" because someone found an old sword in the river there back in 1590, which grew by local legend to become \u201cHannibal's own sword\u201d which (of course) was magical! A quick look at this site showed that it was the worst ground for miles, I should say. I had to study the entire campaign before it, ancient maps and roads, local etymology for place names, walk the ground, see what he saw, go through rafts of evidence from others who went looking for it and look at every single possible site, zooming in on Google Earth and going around using Google Streetview wherever possible. This is actually not a bad idea, since it cuts down the field, and also gives a very good arial view, which is handy\u2026 this isn't to say you can Google your way to finding a battlefield, but is certainly a resource which shouldn't be overlooked. Eventually, the list of \u201cmust haves\" for the battlefield was very clear, and it narrowed down to two sites, one of which had simply more of everything. The other was a poor cousin by comparison. The rest were useless. Military Historian Discovers Hannibal\u2019s Long-Lost Battlefield Now this is an article on what happened. A few idiots have tried to wail about Google maps and elephant dung not being history, but this is social media trolling. That stuff barely scraped the surface of the four years of work that was done, all of which I showed. It has now been accepted. However, prove to the Spanish people that the site \u201cVado de Anibal\" at Colmemar de Oreja wasn't the one, and all you'll find is \u201cOh but the sword! Hannibal's own magical sword\u2026 it was found!\u201d I realised I had to debunk the blasted sword before anyone would accept it\u2026 so I did: Espada de Anibal - The Mystery Behind Hannibal\u2019s Magical Lost Sword These are, as I say, articles only, based upon limited word count and swathes of evidence and hard work. They're nothing like \u201cThe entire case\" as you can imagine! There is simply no other possibility, because I have ruled out every single one of them as I went\u2026 the only thing left is the archaeology, and in Spain, that can take for ever. I guess I can prove the best case for it by a country mile, but even then, without the archaeology, how can we know for sure? I'm 100% sure, because it can't be anywhere else, but I'm still waiting on the results of excavations. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost all historical knowledge comes from written/printed sources. It\u2019s not history if it doesn\u2019t. How does one know if what is written or printed in a source is true? The best single test is to ask what motive did/does the writer have in recording the information? If there is no apparent motive other than recording events, then the material is probably true. If two written sources record the same event or sequence of events in the same way and if there is no apparent link between the two records then that is a good reason for accepting the validity of the information. If the two (or for that matter three, four, etc. writers) differ then the historian has to look for motives in the writers and eliminate as much as possible in his own mind one or more based on suspected or known bias. For instance, if a then contemporary British writer who had some positive relationship with the commanding general of the British forces and goes on to praise the behavior of the British commanding general, then that bias may have influenced the writer\u2019s positive portrayal of how the general influenced the battle. For instance if a British writer is the grandson of the British general who commanded at a certain battle, then the account is suspect. Sometimes the written records are not complete enough to make this kind of judgement and then the historian has to guess which account to favor. Most university trained historians will simply do the best they can. A good example of this process that almost every one will know something about is: How do we know that Jesus was a real person? The New Testament is of course a biased source, so you have to look for a near contemporary of Jesus who writes about him and is not himself/herself a Chrstian. Fortunately there is an especially good source for this: the Roman Emperor Julian who died about 363 AD. Julian hated Christianity and Jesus. But in his writings he simply attacks Jesus and the Christians because they\u2014according to Julian\u2014 were wrong to believe what Jesus and the Christians believed in. If Jesus had never existed Julian would have been happy to write about that and chalk the Christians belief in Jesus as wishful thinking. Julian doesn\u2019t do that and instead spends time criticizing Jesus and his followers. Therefore is probably true that a man called Jesus existed. A further example is the Jewish historian Josephus, who wrote a history of the Jews including a section on the Jews during Jesus\u2019 time. Josephus makes a passing reference to the death of a certain James who he (Josephus) identifies as the \u201cbrother of Jesus.\u201d He makes no reference to Jesus\u2019 teachings or his supposed divinity, but merely mentions as an aside for the benefit of his readers that James was the brother of Jesus. That is awfully good evidence for the existence of Jesus at about the time of the New Testament. Josephus even gives enough evidence so modern historians can date the death of James to about 62 AD (or CE if you wish). Had Jesus not been crucified in his 30s he easily could have lived up to or past 62 AD. ",

            "answer_text": "How do historians know about history? As long as there is documentary evidence available, it is reasonably easy to know. As one of the answers says: Historians read a lot. And dig and dig. After all digging, a historian picks up relevant information and creates his narrative. For instance, I have done a lot of digging to find my ancestors. It is tedious and systematic work with a number of historical records available. I can enrich the straw man story by studying the history of their communities, and possibly even understand something about their economical situation or values. But when we speak about really ancient history, the task is more complex. Let us take an example \u2013 Plato, a great philosopher. This is a brief story, the longer one can be found in the Wikipedia. Did he exist? Along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle, Plato laid the foundations of Western philosophy and science. He probably existed, because so many philosophers cited him. On the other hand, there is no sure way to know what he actually wrote. Citations can be inaccurate, and some scientists actually claim that oldest extant manuscript linked to Plato dates to around CE (Common Era) 895 (1100 years after his death). When and where was he born? Due to a lack of surviving accounts, little is known about Plato's early life and education. The exact time and place of Plato's birth are unknown. Based on ancient sources, most modern scholars believe that he was born in Athens or Aegina between 429 and 423 BCE (Before Common Era). The dates are inferred from various literary works that are in conflict. The philosopher came from one of the wealthiest and most politically active families in Athens. His father was Ariston and mother was Perictione. Ariston and Perictione had three other children; two sons, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and a daughter Potone. The brothers Adeimantus and Glaucon are mentioned in the Republic as sons of Ariston. The Republic was written by Plato around 380 BC. But some have argued they were uncles. And in a scenario in the Memorabilia, Xenophon confused the issue by presenting a Glaucon much younger than Plato. So who knows? This example shows that there are various ways of knowing with varying accuracy. How much accuracy is needed, depends on the objectives of the study. If someone is famous enough, he probably existed. It can be confirmed by examination of different references to his works or life. We know something about his life through his own or other people\u00b4s literary works. We can deduce timings in a similar manner \u2013 who were living at the same time, earlier or later. The work of historian is to filter the myths out from traditional records and construct \u201ca network of evidence\u201d - a set of information that supports his conclusions. The first question is: \u201dWhat happened, if anything?\u201d The next question often is: \u201dWho, when, and in what order?\u201d The timing is important. Using key milestones a chronology can be constructed, and using that chronology something about sequences or even cause and effect can be said. There are basically two complementary ways of timing: relative and absolute. In relative timing we can benefit from knowing who lived simultaneously with whom. Or like in the case of Plato \u2013 we definitely know that he lived after Socrates, and was adult before Aristotle. In absolute timing we either use known dates as reference points, or create by using dendrochronological, C14, or other technical age analyses. Let\u00b4s take an example - The Minoan volcano eruption of Thera, current Santorini. The eruption was one of the biggest in known history. It provides a fixed point for aligning the entire chronology of the second millennium BCE in the Aegean or Mediterranean, as evidence of the eruption is found throughout the region. The starting point of discussion was the archaeological timing of this vast eruption of a volcano. Based on archaeologists, the eruption took place around 1500 BCE. This timing was based on decades of relative timing of different cultures in the area. Radiocarbon dates gave a date between 1627 BCE and 1600 BCE. This is 100 years off from archaeologists estimates, and the discrepancy has been a very important issue. It has given room for many exotic timing schemes, for instance regarding the number and reins of Egyptian kings. And of course, it is importan for timing of and reasons for collapse of Minoan culture in Crete, a prime target for tsunami from the eruption. Greenland ice cores show evidence of a large volcanic eruption in 1642 \u00b1 5 BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint. In this case scientists from many different areas of expertise were used to eliminate one possibility. Evidence from tree rings from California, Ireland, England, Germany, and Sweden for instance, show a significant climatic event (possibly due to vast amount of pumice in the atmosphere) in 1628 BCE. This is how science should work. It has taken decades to reach this point, where the archaeologists must seriously consider their traditional time line of everything in the Mediterranean history. These cycles of calibration gradually lead to more exact sequences. Interpretation is another issue. Historians are great interpreters - this is their job but also a major source of scientific and not so scientific fights. There simply does not exist a single historical narrative for anything. Everything can be interpreted from a multitude of angles, and endlessly disputed. As long as the science part is solid, this comparison of narratives enriches the total picture, but as it sometimes happens, the debate becomes a personal lose/win battle. Then it is more about politics than science. ",

            "answer_text": "Note! I am including an addendum of things to remember, when dealing with history below, from my own expoerience. Heraclitus, one of the ancient Greek Philosophers, said \u201cYou can never step in the same stream twice, for it is not the same stream, nor are you the same man.\u201d So historians research primary & secondary sources. They keep their ear to the ground for what is going on in the other social sciences, sciences, and humanities, such archeology, magnetometers/ survey, and listen to folklore. He travels to sites where events occurred, He talks to people of the area and the experts. He sees the sites upon which he studies and he studies them in his mind\u2019s eye, to get a feel for what happened. Example, I went to the national monument of a US Civil War battle site. It was a fine place, a hill, with nicely mowed grass (the hill would have no grass but would have been dusty or muddy, smoke and burnt out trees and discarded stuff lying about), I walked up the hill, carrying my camera, and there was a statue on the top waiting for me (rather than rifles and bayonets). (In my mind, I pictured me with a rifle, bullets whizzing by, artillery shells, dirt & sweat, a heavy pack - instead of the lightweight camera, running & dodging obstacles, (instead of walking), to kill or be killed awaiting me at the top, surrounded by death all around me and the cries of the wounded. The historian will then go to his writer\u2019s garret, write papers that are peer reviewed. In the end, what is one left it? An educated guess. I have a theory. There was a woman, Boudica, and Tacitus tells us that the Romans counter-charged the Celts (who retreated), and the Celts got hung up in their wagon train. The Celts were slaughtered because they were sandwiched in between the murderous Romans and the wagons, which prevented their escape. The Dodd theory says that the Roman\u2019s counter-charged the Celts. The Celts had foreseen this possibility and previously tipped over their wagons from which to fight from behind. Unfortunately, for the Celts & Boudica, the Romans did an excellent job of herding the Celts away from holes in the ramparts that would have allowed the Celts to cross the barricade and fight on. So the Celts died. The point, arcane if you are not into this, was that unlike how the Celts are portrayed, a charging bunch of wild, homicidal, savages that panicked and were easily picked off the Romans; they were much more intelligent and skilled fighters, and therefore people, who had the presence of mind to form a Plan B. That it didn\u2019t work is to the credit of the Romans. However, in victory or defeat, the Celts were out-fought warriors, not frighten hordes or a rabble! Getting back to my point, that is a theory, an educated guess, not a stone-cold immutable fact. Did Boudica exist? I believe she did, but I could advance a theory of a leader in folklore, who was conjured up by a rapidly defeated bunch of Celts, a la Arthur! Celts who were deeply in WHAT-IF MODE. That is almost certainly wrong, but it is offered up to support the concept there is VERY little that is the last word in history. That is why historians love the term \u201caccepted fact.\u201d It is 99.9999% probably true, but you know! Something may come up, that demolishes your best work. History is dynamic! It is NEVER staid, nor is it stale, but it is always changing! As the corpus of knowledge grows or is reinterpreted, history shifts, as does the currents of that stream. Neither is the historian the same person who ends his career in retirement with a lifetime of experiences, as he was, the fresh faced graduate picking up his degree to embark on his chosen career. There is a fictitious, short story that I once read. It was an archeologist of several centuries in the future, report of a 20th century of a bathroom that he had unearthed. He had interpreted what he found as a family temple and to describe the bathroom in that context. He described each thing in the bath, as some religious artifact, for instance the sink was the purification stand. It has been a long time, and my memory omitted details, but you get the idea. This was a great cautionary tale. Three things! 1. You can only do what you can do! Man is imperfect! Guard against that, but allow for it, in spite of your best effort. You are not the last word. Be open-minded enough to give new ideas a fair hearing. 2. The essentials, the basics of life, don\u2019t change. (So unless you live in a house that has a temple, and no bathroom; reexamine your ideas.) This rule is your stating point. 3. Don\u2019t fall in love with your subject. Another way to say - keep an open mind! I had a professor, Harvard grad (Phd), and taught Chinese History - good teacher, in spite of his eccentricity.) His eccentricity was wearing black framed, with circular lenses, eyeglasses; tan short sleeved, buttoned, shirt, tan shorts, knee socks, and black, laced, shoes. He was missing a pith helmet, and a machete. In spite of being caucasian, he almost looked oriental. He appeared to be right out of central casting in a black and white movie role saying \u201cHyde-Smythe is lost in the jungle and I am going to find him.\u201d He had that Livingston in search of Schweitzer air! As I said, excellent teacher, in spite of taking it a little too far, sometimes. So for me, I have been a technical adviser to films and re-enactors, but I never was a re-enactor, myself, of the Celts (my specialty.) Maintain distance from your subject. I dress appropriately and once I am finished with work, I am back in the 21st century. I find the Celts but I have no desire to hop into a time machine and join them. These three things will warp your analysis of your subject matter. ",

Courts records are an excellent primary  sources. It can be pots, weapons, jewelry, cloth, etc. After primary sources, the historian moves to secondary sources. The historian can create a secondary source by writing a book, report, monograph, etc., or  continue the study of the past by reading what previous researchers wrote. A history book can be a secondary source as can a biography. Reconstructing the past is a long term commitment. A historian can expend a lifetime on one subject. All humanity benefits from the work historians do.  Using Primary Sources Historiography - Wikipedia Images are from the internet. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing, and the most basic, is that they read - a lot. And they always make notes of what they read, because memory is unreliable. Then, there are various other ways in which they may enlarge their understanding of the past: statistics (where they can be recovered), textual study or Quellenforschung (study of sources) , in which a historian approaches a text not only from the viewpoint of what it says, but of what it wants us to understand, and also of what sources can be detected in it and what they, in turn intend us to understand. Style and language can also be analyzed significantly. Textual study can then be associated with social and economic history, so as to get a picture of what a society thinks and how it connects on what they do and how they live. Archaeology is everywhere, of course. You can study the history of the arts, of the progress or regress of knowledge, of engineering and and other technical skills, of seamanship and the knowledge (or lack thereof) of distant countries, and of the evolution and mutation of language. All sorts of things can be history, if you can place them in a historical frame - that is, a frame of events taking place in time. But first and foremost and last, you read and you take notes and you read and you take notes. ",

            "answer_text": "On the seventh of this month (according to Quora), I answered the question: \u201cHistory is written by winners. How can I trust anything written in history books?\u201d As your query is almost identical, I make no apology for pasting that response here. This is it: \u201cAn acquaintance of mine once told me of an incident which occurred shortly before he had completed his degree at a top university. His subject was ancient history, and he was having his viva voce. After he had spent about ten minutes explaining what occurred at the death of Julius Caesar, or some such incident, one of the examiners looked him in the eye and said: \u201cBut you weren't there, were you?\u201d So, the short answer is you cannot trust everything you read in the history books. However, 'writing' in its various forms has been around for a very long time, and you can always look up the original sources. There are court documents, government documents and local official documents, all dating back centuries, and even millennia. Thus, a careful study of these papers should bring you to a close approximation of the what really occurred. Then of course there is the physical evidence. There are ruins of buildings, skeletal remains and ancient artifacts, all of which can provide detailed information for those experts who know exactly what they are looking for. Anyway, I trust that helps.\u201d ",

The historians while writing gives the reference of the credible sources they have done research on and how they came to the conclusion. If two sides are involved in an event of history both sides of the history are written down. Unfortunately in India, the history present in books was blindly taken from historians like Marxist - Irfan Habib and Romila Thapar. No verification of what they are saying was done with the newspaper of that time or taking multiple credible sources but rather one person viewpoint was presented as the \u201cHistory of India\u201d. This history was tailored in such way that it doesn't talk anything which hurts the Muslims like the conversions that happened during Mughals times or about the fact that Mughals never ruled the whole India completely or the different Hindu rulers who won wars, valor of different warriors like Guru Gobind Singh Ji, Maharana Pratap, Chanakya, Shivaji Maharaj or about any word like Bharat, why Bharat was known as the golden bird nothing but it suited the government of India that time which resulted in a prime minister to remain in seat for 18 years a row.

Many rock edicts of ancient kings are found at various place, sometimes guving the name of the ruler. Gifts donations made by kings to individuals, temples are seen on rocks and copper plates. Many rulers had contemporary historians on pay roll. This may help to some extent in knowing the history of that time. There is a vast literature of foreign travellers to India in good old days.

You have an idea of what the artwork looks like, but it has been abused, damaged and badly repaired over the years. I first got interested in Oliver Cromwell in the 1980s. I read his speech on the dissolution of the 1653 Parliament and it was tailor made for the government we had in Britain at the time I began to read more of the things he wrote in a book by Thomas Carlyle. \u2018The Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell\u2019. (with elucidations by the author). Then I had to take a look at his contemporaries and became hooked on some of them too. The man whose letters I had read, and his thoughts that I had been privy to, bore no resemblance to the man constantly represented in modern times. The \u2018work of art\u2019 had been abused and put together all wrong. For two hundred years, it was not a good idea to publish anything positive about Cromwell or the Interregnum Parliament. Writers were employed by Patrons and Patrons relied on bigger Patrons. People wrote what the Patron wanted to see. Also, there were two major organisations which were able to derogated Cromwell. The Monarch and the Church of England, ably assisted in the most scurrilous accusations and stories by the Church of Rome. Even now, the story, when subjected to close scrutiny continues to unravel. The Religious Bigot is seen more as a Religious Independent. A man who fought against intolerance and enforcement and Inquisition. He was the most reluctant dictator the World has ever seen. He was England's own, personal drudge and later, whipping boy In studying Cromwell, I had to study the people around him and look at World events. I also looked at events surrounding in terms of before and after the Cromwellian events. Questions I needed to ask and get answers to.: What was the effect of the Rebellion and the Confederate was on the enteral population of Ireland through eight years of fighting and depredations by soldiers living on Free Quarter? What happened to the prisoners from the various battles fought during the eight years if turmoil? And then the big question: What would have happened if Cromwell had not been able to restore order in Ireland. What if he had failed? I have read many books and tried not to be unduly influenced by the authors. It is great to find something which I know to be wrong in a respected Author\u2019s work. Silly things, like adding that the Scots were Sheltering behind corn shocks at Dunbar when there had been no harvest. Or the other one where various Authors tell us that \u2018as the sun appeared above St. Abbs head, I heard Oliver cry \u201cLet the Lord arise and let his foes be scattered! \u201c. If you could see the Sun coming up over St. Abbas head, then you were not at Dunbar, you were fifteen miles down the Coast towards Berwick upon Tweed. At Dunbar, the sun comes up, straight out of the German Sea. If you take a character or subject \u2018head on\u2019, you may not get to know them, so the books written about other people of the time give you views that people often miss. Ambassadors to Cromwell's Court. Relationships with other countries. All go to shape the man. To me, it is something I wish I had spent my whole life working on. As daft as it may seem, I consider myself to be the self appointed Ambassador for Oliver Cromwell to the twenty first century. ",
