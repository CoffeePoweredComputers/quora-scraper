            "answer_text": "the pair are cannon bones of some herbivore - could be sheep, could be deer could be cow etc. need a scale to get any idea of which. The long bone on edge is probably a toe from something or other. A different view would help. The near spherical thing is the head of a femur, again could be just about anything. If you get something positively identified that might well help with other things. ",

Judging by the size--and depending on what kinds of animals you have around you--I'd hazard a guess that it's a deer. But that would just be a guess. It could be a large dog. ",
