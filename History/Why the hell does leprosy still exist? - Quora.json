Despite the fact that its curable with antibiotics, Leprosy still exists due to various reasons as follows: Due to long incubation period, the disease cannot be diagnosed early, which is a constant threat to other population.The inapparent infections (persons who have got infection but are symptomless) are also source of infection.MDT (Multi-Drug Therapy) is required for its cure, which in most of the developing countries is not available in quantity required. Also the patients compliance to therapy is not good which leads to resistance cases.Due to ineffective surveillance system also the cases persists which makes other persons nearby vulnerable.Finally, migration into endemic areas makes the disease to maintain its prevalence pool.",

Besides, in cancer case, cure exists but some corporates keep it a secret just to sell expensive medication. Horrible situation for patients and society in general :( ",
