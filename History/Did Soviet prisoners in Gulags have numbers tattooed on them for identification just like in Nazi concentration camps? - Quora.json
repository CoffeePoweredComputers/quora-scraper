            "answer_text": "No they didn\u2019t. The corrective labor camps in the Soviet Union, administered by the GULag, were not analogous in any way to the German death camps. (According to Red Cross reports they fed the prisoners adequately, for one thing.) It was the bright idea of the MI6 propaganda wing, specifically their agent Robert Conquest, to try to create a connection between them in the public mind. A tsunami of fiction followed, some labelled fiction, some not. The labor camps were the outcome of a prison reform movement that held it was not only not rehabilitative but was actively inhumane to shut people up in metal cages with nothing to occupy their hands or minds. These were Russian socialists, remember. They did not shrink with horror from the idea of work, even when performed in the outdoors in winter! The Soviet Union still had jails for the most serious offenders. Then the criminal population had three tiers of control, starting with supervised parole, then, for people with sentences less than two years, assignment to \u2018light labor,\u2019 usually helping on farms, then the hard labor camps which Solzhenitzen nicknamed \u201cthe gulag\u201d after the civil service office that administered the prison system, Glavnoe Upravlenie Lagerei, or Main Camp Administration. The \u2018hard labor\u2019 tier dug the Moscow subway tunnel, built roads and railways, staffed mines and lumber camps. The people in them were mostly common criminals. Soviet law did not divide crimes into political and non-political, that is a modern invention, so historians are finding it a hard slog going through all the paperwork trying to find out who was which. Their interim conclusion is that the \u201cpolitical criminals\u201d were a small minority. Roughly one-third of the prisoners were released every year at the end of their sentences. Now that they\u2019re getting actual evidence, researchers are finding that there were many more people through the gulags than they had ever guessed. There was also early release for good behaviour. One of Gorbachev\u2019s grandfathers was released early with letters of recommendation from his camp commandant and his work foreman. It\u2019s doubtful that anything evidence-based was written before this century. Certainly nothing like this, which is just the start. Death and Redemption: the shaping of Soviet society Steven A.

            "answer_text": "No, they did not have such tattoos. They were supposed to have one particular skill - be capable of promptly verbally reporting to any person authorized to ask questions, their credentials, particularly, in-mate number, full name, date and place of birth, articles of legislation violated-perpetrated. Individuals authorized to ask such questions were prison guards and professional criminals. Professional criminals were actually the tools for control of political prisoners. And the thing is that for criminals, tattoos are their CVs, their secret HR and their prerogative. Failure to properly answer the question would result in immediate punishment. Presence of a tattoo on the body of a non-criminal prisoner would cause questions. Based on answers, behaviours and general cool-ness of a person, professional criminals would either punish a person, for example tell that person to take the knife and slice-off that part of skin that had a tattoo, which was not accepted by professional criminals. Or, they would just let such person go. One funny incident happened to one Soviet academic. Has nothing to do with tattoos, but just a touch depicting life in prison camps in the times of Stalin. A famous scientist, he was falsely accused of treason, and, to worsen things for him in jail - of \u201c\u2026raping a member of the Communist Party\u2026\u201d What criminals do to real rapists is a common practice everywhere. As for that scientist, when he came to his prison destination, its criminal bosses came to welcome him with respect. They told the man - \u201c\u2026you are cool, you know. If we just slit their throats, that is not enough for you, you rape them, don\u2019t you\u2026you are bad\u2026\u201d ",
