            "answer_text": "I added this before my previous response on the war statistics below\u2026. The Prison conditions for Americans were cruel and inhumane, 75% died. Provost Marshall William Cunningham was a fiend and sold food provisions for the captured Americans to line his pockets. Over 10,000 Americans died under this brutal treatment, many in putrid prison ships. General Washington made enquiry to British General Howe, saying he was pressured by many of the horrid conditions that had been mentioned to him. Washington said he might be seen in the British eyes as a rebel, but he could respond in kind if true. Gen. Howe did nothing to alleviate the terrible deadly conditions. These patriots chose death over dishonor. By signing a simple note pledging allegiance to the British, they could have been freed from the prison and enrolled in the British Army or Navy. Deadly British prison ships were also anchored at Savana and Charleston. NOW THE STATISTICS The Americans had about 200,000 patriots that served, with 40,000 being the highpoint at one time. The British had 48,000 troops, backed up by 25,000 Loyalists, 2,400 Hanoverians, 30,000 Germans, 13,000 Indians. The Americans lost about 7,000 troops to fighting, but disease and starvation took a much higher toll, of near 18,000, so total losses during the war was 25,000. The British lost about 4,000 in battle with 24,000 death from disease. But an even greater factor was that the British had 42,000 deserters. American Loyalists had 1,700 killed in action, 5,300 from disease. The Germans losses were 1,800 killed in battle, 6,000 by disease and 5,000 by desertion. Many Germans that didn\u2019t desert, stayed in America after the war. Back during the Revolutionary War, bullet wounds could easily lead to infections. A shattered bone led to amputation. So deaths on the battle field were easy to count, but a lingering death due to battle was counted as disease. Those practicing medicine at that time knew nothing of germs. The medical instruments were not sterilized between patients, but with the previous person\u2019s blood on it, it entered into the next body. Infections were common, often deadly. Small pox, cholera, typhoid, and other diseases associated with uncleanliness ravaged troops, plus food poisoning. Contagious diseases could wipe out many as there were no cures at the time. The Americans losses in battle were less than all of those they fought against. But the British were better trained, and American losses in open battles, always favored higher losses among Americans. The British suffered more in the sneak attacks, with the \u201ccowardly\u201d Americans taking cover, instead of marching in \u201cmanly\u201d formations. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is wrong. The British were not against the colonists. Americans did rebel against the Crown, but large numbers of Americans fought in Regular British Units, in Provincial units, or in Loyalist militia units. They also joined the Royal Navy, or served in privateer ships. I suggest that you rephrase the question as follows what was the casualties on the rebel side (including Indians, French and Spanish forces) and the casualties of His Majesty\u2019s Forces (British, German, American and Indians).
