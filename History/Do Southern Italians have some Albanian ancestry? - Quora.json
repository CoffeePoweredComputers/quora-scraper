            "answer_text": "Original question : Do Southern Italians have some Albanian ancestry? Answer : this answer is not wrong and not right.. It is just formuleded bad. Why? Do SOME Southern Italians have some Albanian ancestry? YES. Do (all) Southern Italians have some Albanian ancestry? NO. Often, during the centuries when the Turks of the Ottoman Empire invaded the Balkan Peninsula, many foreigners found a safe country in southern Italy\u2019s regions. These peoples were mainly Greeks, who have a very long history of encounters with southern Italy because in classical times to escape famine they came here and mixing with the local populations gave life to the cities of Magna Graecia, and Albanians. Magna Graecia :  The Greek populations, thanks to previous contacts with local populations or a greater strength of adaptation, have mixed completely with the population of southern Italy. In fact, in any genetic test you will see that Italians and Greeks are very close together, especially Southern Italians and Greeks. There are Griko, a minorance from south Italy that still talk in Greek, but you can see by thier dress that they are pretty near and mixed with Italian tarantella\u2019s dresses (obviously italians have many traditional dress for different traditional dances ). Grikos :  Italians without foreign ancestry with tarantella traditional dress: Calabria  Sicily  Campania :  While Albanians preserved way better their traditions and uniqueness but this was possible only because they integrated themselves less successfully. So, some Southern italians are in touch with their Albanians roots, those people call themselves Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb and their language and traditions are protected by the Italian State itself as historical minorities to be preserved. Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb speak Italian and Albanian and follow Albanian festivals, preserve traditional Albanian customs, eat recipes that are a mix between Italian and Albanian ones. This is beautiful because it is a clear manifestation of a historical period of Italy but most importantly of Albania, but it also shows that the Albanians have mixed way less than Greeks and that therefore only a few Southern Italians have some Albanian ancestors. While a lot of southern italians have some form of Greek ancestry. Plus, another difference is that Greeks settled themselves in small cities on the coast but since they mixed themselves with native Italians they spread all over the south while Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb are inside some specifical villages : Piana degli Albanesi in Sicily, Civita, Calabria in Calabria, Casalvecchio di Puglia in Apulia, Barile in Basilicata, Greci, Campania in Campania (my region), Ururi in Molise, Villa Badessa in Abruzzo. Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb in South Italy :   ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they do. They identify themselves as Arberesh which is the old Albanian name and been there for almost 600 years keeping their tongue and their tradition alive. It tells you how proud they are for their origin and we're proud of them as well. They left to Italy after the death of Skanderbeg our national hero and the turks massacred the albanian people everywhere. So they always identify themselves Arberesh. If you ask are we genetically connected I say yes because ones we were the same people both sides of Adriatic sea. I know is been a long time and in nowadays people change their identity in the couple of generations but that's the truth. They spoke the MOTHER LANGUAGE same as us for thousands of years before they invented their own. Still everything that comes from ancient world speaks Albanian. Albanian language has two dialects GEG and TOSKE and there is a region in Italy called TOSCANA which literally means we're TOSKE, and another one called LOMBARDI which literally means we know how to grow crops in Albanian tongue. Etrusky the old Italian name means the FATHERLAND, river PO = YES. ROME=WE LIVE ON IT, SICILIA = OPEN EYE, SARDINIA = THEY COME AND STAYED, CORSICA = NEVER LEFT, ITALY =GOING NORTH, VEZUVIO= SHAPED LIKE EG, GOVERNMENT =THERE YOU PUT THE BRAIN(meaning smart people), REPUBLIC = WHERE PEOPLE STANDS . SAPORE =JUST NEW, I can go on for every word and show the true origin of them which is the MOTHER LANGUAGE Albanian. Douse things are sensitive to people but the TRUTH shouldn't be denied because sooner or later it's going to triumph, and don't be deceived by the name Albanian because she had many names throughout her glorious life.

There are old Albanian communities(orthodox) especially in Calabria and Sicilia who moved there since 14th and 15th century due to invasion of Ottomans. They still speak an older version of Albanian called \u2018arberesh\u2019 sane as the one spoken by Albanians(arvanitas) who moved same time (even earlier) to nowadays Greek areas. Most of them are blended in with Italians but still speak \u2018arberesh\u2019 which is one of the historical minorities languages spoken in southern Italy, along with Catalan, Calabrian Greek, Sardinian, Serbo-Croatian, etc. I would not say southern Italians have Albanian ancestral blood.

Such us the town of Spezzano Albanese (Spixana), in Calabria, where they speek Albanian, ot to better say Arb\u00ebreshe, the Italian variant of the Albanian language. The origin of these comunities goes back to the XV Centuries, when a number of Albanians fled their country during the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, and settled in Italy. This is the coat of Arms of Spezzano Albanese, with the two eagles.  And this is the flag of Albania  ",
