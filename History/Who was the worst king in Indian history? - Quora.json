            "answer_text": "Worst king or biggest traitor in history, let me think\u2026\u2026\u2026.  I think he should be declared as the biggest traitor. Guess who is he? You know him. He became the reason for Muslim rule in India \u2026 So you Got him Yeah he is \u201cJaichand Gahadwal\u201d ruler of Kannauj, father of\u201c Sahyogita\u201d yeah Princess of kannauj who eloped with Delhi Naresh \u2018Prithviraj Chauhan',Maternal grandfather of Prithviraj Chauhan, Raja Anangpal gave Delhi to him. In this grudge, \u201cJaichand \u201dbecame enemy of \u201cPrithviraj\u201d. He wanted to finish Prithviraj and affair of Prithviraj with Sahyogita came as a big insult to him. Therefore in order to avenge his loss, he befriended \u201cMohammed shahbuddin ghori\u201d, ruler of Ghor (present day Afghanistan) When ghori invaded India in 1192, for the 2nd time, after a humiliating defeat from Prithviraj, this time with a bigger army, Prithviraj united with all the kings to form a big army. He also invited Jaichand but he declined. Instead he became ally of ghori in the fire of taking revenge Ultimately Prithviraj was defeated, blinded by inserting hot iron in his eyes and martyred at Ghor. After his defeat Jaichand was also beheaded by ghori. And an \u201cIslamic empire\u201d was established in Delhi which subsequently expanded to other parts of the country. Thus country paid a huge price because Delhi sultanate got established and Hindus were humiliated, murdered and their humiliation continued for centuries that ended with our partition. Had Prithviraj not been ditched by Jaichand history would be way different. Pic: Google ",

            "answer_text": "It is funny how every such question ends up with references to \u201cthose foreign kings\u201d. First of all what is this \u201cworst\u201d that you are using as an adjective. Is it the idea of evaluating kings on the basis of our modern morality? Murder, Genocide, Plunder has been a way of life of all aristocracies until very lately. It was the norm. There was no universal declaration of human rights or even the idea of one or some constitution and judicial system granting you protection from excesses of the kings. If Muslim \u201cforeign\u201d kings were so horrible by that account then so were all \u201clocal\u201d Indian kings. The Bengalis were slaughtered by Maratha empire. Their lullabies are filled with references to this day. Even Asoka slaughtered thousands from Kalinga - didnt he? So many wars and empires dot Indian history - ever expanding and ever disintegrating. Am I to believe that these changes did not lead to gruesome wars and genocide in one of the world\u2019s most populous parts. Were court coups only done by Muslims? How did the great Maurya dynasty end? When Emperor Brihadratha was killed by his own general who then started his own dynasty. All power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. In the quest and hunger for power every man has done horrible deeds - irrespective of religion or colour or creed. Why should not be the Hindu kings of old be called the \u201cworst\u201d when they gave legal sanction to casteism. Let me see the Mahars and other lower castes of the time not call the Peshwas the worst when they fought against them. Sure there have been outright madmen and then there have just been kings. The kings did what kings have always done - been the highest authority and hence done as they wished. Unfortunately for these foreign kings - their histories are well documented than of those who came before them. It could also be said that they probably had a hand in those documents (if any) not lasting. Moreover, those who held the keys to knowledge - the Brahmins would not write horrible stories of their own kings. Its only when knowledge was diversified and Brahmins lost their hold do we start hearing varying accounts of a narrative. Do not forget the Brahmins were in Bed with your \u201cforeign kings\u201d and without them no rule could be established - think of them as the bureaucrats of the day. Only when the Sultante started forcing them to convert do we actually start hearing about stories of genocide of the population - a classic example of Brahmin treachery of their faith and people. Did Muslims force conversion? Maybe. But It is so easily and naively forgotten that many converted to leave behind the chains of caste. That \u201cgolden sparrow\u201d is a myth - wealth inequity and caste inequality existed even then. Millions would convert only to convert back. Things were not as rigid as they are presented to be. The Indian cottage industries and trade only comes with the \u201cMuslim\u201d kings thus actually making India the mythical golden sparrow. And back to the question - to hunt for the \u201cworst\u201d king/queen of India : It is most definitely - \u201cQueen Victoria\u201d Since we can judge her by the morality of her own time. The genocide the EIC took part in in India was against the very laws the British promised their own citizens. The depriving of India from Industrial revolution and in turn feeding British Industry can be attributed to her reign. The genocide of entire villages post 1857. The cutting off of fingers of weavers, the forced destruction of handlooms, the tarrifs raised and embargoes on Indians. All of this stood against Britains own held principles. Britain went to war with nations if trade routes were blocked or trade was affected - the Royal Navy having been built to assure the freedom of seas and trade. Where were those principles when it came to Indian industry? Poof! This empress saw the decline of India - saw the loot of India (Muslim kings except the first 2 and the few invaders between did loot Indian kingdoms but the money stayed in India) She oversaw the beginning of the process through which Indias share of world trade went down from 23 percent around 1750s to 1 percent on the eve of independence. (Britains share rose from 1 in 1757 or so to 23 by 1947) So there you go - Queen Victoria is the worst queen India ever had ",
