            "answer_text": "His achievements on the battlefield don't need to be spelled out. Needless to say, he must have far exceeded even his own expectations. On the eve of his first battle, the camp fires from the Persian camp apparently outnumbered the stars in the sky. He forbid his own army from cooking their meals that night, so the enemy couldn't see by how much they outnumbered them. What makes him stand out though, was his conviction, and his belief in himself. His mother Olympia, claimed that when she conceived, she dreamed that she was struck by a lightning bolt from heaven and would give birth to fire. She claimed he was the son of Zeus, something Alexander sought confirmation of when he went on a pilgrimage to the Oracle of the Siwa Oasis. Interestingly enough, the Egyptian priests were willing to support his claims, possibly giving both him and his army the aura of destiny and invincibility. His mother claimed descent from Achilles, and that is who Alexander modeled himself after. He reportedly kept a copy of the Iliad on him all the time. When his ship approached the coast of Asia Minor, he cast his spear onto the beach in Homeric style, and claimed Asia for Greece. He visited the altar of Achilles in Troy, and claimed the armor as his own. He fought his battles leading from the front, and was always in the thickest part of the fray. Once, he shocked his troops by scaling the inner city walls of a city they were besieging in the Punjab (Malli) and jumped in alone (another Homeric style stunt, possibly inspired by Diomedes attempt to scale the walls of Troy). The surprised defenders withdrew momentarily, but on recognizing him, attacked. Alexander stood his ground, killing the king, but was badly wounded by an arrow in the chest. When his troops finally caught up with him, they believed he had been mortally wounded. Thats more or less an introduction to his character. As for his achievements, I'd say his management skills stand out. Interestingly enough, when he defeated the local king, he would reappoint him on the throne. Alexander knew it took local talent and inside knowledge to successfully manage his empire. He was usually never harsh to those he defeated, which is why many cities willingly accepted him as conquerer without a drop of blood being spilt. He encouraged his men to accept the locals as equals, and adopted many of their customs himself. He became so famous in the area he contested, that the name Iskander is widely known even today. He is the only mortal to be known by name in The Koran where he is called Dhul-Qarnayn, or \u201cthe two horned one\u201d. The horns referred to are the horns of the ram-God Zeus-Ammon, whose son the Egyptian priests confirmed he was the son of. Coins of that era depict Alexander wearing those horns.  Interestingly, Daniel 8 in the Old Testament is also apparently a prophecy of Alexander as well. Alexander had his pulse on the beliefs of the day, and was well aware of the power of prophecy, and he took care to use local legends to his advantage. One other such legend was that of the Gordian Knot. The legend foretold that whoever could solve the Knot would conquer Asia. When Alexander failed to untie the knot, he knew the significance of such a failure. So he withdrew his sword and sliced the knot, declaring \u201c\u038c,\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03bb\u03cd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u201d (What can't be solved, can be cut), apparently fulfilling the prophecy to the satisfaction of the population. That\u2019s pretty much much my contribution. Together with the other comments, that should help out. I will on occasion update this account if I think of anything else interesting to add. ",

He was the first person to unite the whole of Greece(except Sparta and Crete) against the Persians He was never defeated in battle and always fought in front line. There were many times when he risked dying because of his recklessness in battle. He was the first person who ever conceived the idea of a globalized world. He wanted to create a multinational Hellenistic empire and not just conquer and HellenizeHe was the first person to understand that his image was very important, and did  anything in his hand to promote himself as God, great King , and a fearsome warrior. He achieved that by hiring a personal autobiographer , a painter , and a sculptor He crossed along with his army the desert called Gedrosia. Many died there because of the desert conditions. He survived this denying to have any comforts.He actually spilled a whole helmet full of water in front of the whole army to show an example . ",
