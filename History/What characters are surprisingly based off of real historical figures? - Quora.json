            "answer_text": "Mel Gibson\u2019s character in \u201cThe Patriot\u201d is very loosely based on Francis Marion, the famed \u201cSwamp Fox\u201d of whom British Col. Banastre Tarleton (in the movie named Tavington) inadvertently gave Marion his nickname when, after a planned ambush of Marion\u2019s forces failed (Marion didn\u2019t fall for the trap) said \u201cCome my boys! Let us go back, and we will soon find the Gamecock [Thomas Sumter]. But as for this damned old fox, the Devil himself could not catch him.\u201d According to this Wikipedia article, Gibson\u2019s character, Benjamin Martin, is a composite of Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter, Daniel Morgan, and Andrew Pickens, all prominent American commanders during the Revolutionary War. The Patriot (2000 film) - Wikipedia. The film should not, by any means, be taken as an accurate account of the Revolution. Robert Duvall\u2019s character in \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d, Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore, was reportedly based on David Hackworth, a decorated US Army Colonel who served in both Korea and Vietnam and went on to become a controversial figure when, in a 1971 interview, said that the US could not win the war in Vietnam and should withdraw. Apocalypse Now (1979) - IMDb David Hackworth - Wikipedia In 1968 one of John Wayne\u2019s more forgettable movies, the \u201cGreen Berets\u201d has him as the Green Berets Col. Mike Kirby. The character he was based on, Green Berets Capt. Larry Thorne, had a much more interesting life than anything shown in the movie. Larry Thorne was actually Finnish, and before he anglicized his name he was known as Lauri Torni, and had been a Finnish Lieutenant and Captain in the Winter War (1939\u20131940) against the Soviet Union and in the Continuation War (what the Finns called WWII) allied with Nazi Germany from 1941\u20131944. After Finland\u2019s surrender he escaped from Germany and fought as an SS Lieutenant in the final weeks of the war. Convicted of treason in Finland (under pressure from the Soviet Union, as he had kept fighting after Finland\u2019s surrender) he was sentenced to 6 years. Torni escaped from prison, was eventually pardoned. He travelled to Sweden and got a job on as a seaman on a Swedish cargo ship, jumped ship in the Gulf of Mexico and swam to the US, worked as a carpenter and cleaner, and joined the US Army as a private in 1954. Because of his training and natural abilities (as one might surmise he was an excellent soldier, and physically very tough) he joined the Green Berets became and instructor, and was commissioned as an officer in 1960. Deployed to Vietnam in 1963, he was awarded the Bronze star for valor and two Purple Hearts in during an attack on a camp he was stationed in. During his second tour he was killed in a helicopter crash in 1965. Thorne had gained a legendary reputation in the Special Forces, and many of his fellow soldiers refused to believe he could actually have been killed. His remains weren\u2019t actually found until 1999, and in 2003 he was finally buried in Arlington Cemetery. Thorne is the only known former member of the Waffen SS to be buried in Arlington Cemetery. He is also considered a national hero in Finland.

            "answer_text": "Did you know that this grotesque monster is actually based off a real person?  You\u2019re probably wondering, \u201cWho could possibly inspire Frankenstein\u2019s monster?\u201d Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein, wrote this monster after herself. Just like the monster, Mary Shelley too knew what it was like to be rejected and hated by society.  Frankenstein's creature was a hated outcast due to his physical grotesqueness and all those who met the monster were horrified. Mary Shelley was also hated by society for being an unmarried mother and having an illegitimate child. All her friends and family ceased association with her and treated what she did as if it was a menacing crime. Understandably, Mary Shelley was greatly hurt to be vilified by those who once loved her. Victor Frankenstein, the young inventor and \u201cfather\u201d of the monster, abandons his creation in horror because of its looks. Mary Shelley\u2019s father, William Godwin, too abandoned her after she ran off with a married man. Her father was also a philosopher who advocated for free love and was against the institution of marriage. Therefore, his abandonment of his daughter who followed his principles appeared hypocritical to her. In her novel Frankenstein, Mary Shelley poured out her anguish. She viewed the prejudices of society as unjustly cruel. She should\u2019ve never been ostracized for loving another man. Just like the monster shouldn\u2019t be condemned for its appearance. The only difference between Mary Shelley and the monster she created was that she never went on a murderous rampage. In essence, the creature took revenge for her. In the end, Mary Shelley married poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, the man she ran off with, and society slowly accepted her but it took many years because she was viewed as scandalous. Frankenstein\u2019s monster is a reflection of Mary Shelley\u2019s sufferings and how cruelly unjust society can be. ",
