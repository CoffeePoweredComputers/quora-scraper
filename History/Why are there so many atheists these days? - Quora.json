            "answer_text": "Why are there many more atheists now than in the past? Let\u2019s start this with a disclaimer: This is just my opinion and I don\u2019t have any hard facts to back it up. The easy answer is that we know more about the way things work and the scientific basis for more phenomena. We know what causes lighting and thunder, we understand more about earthquakes, tornadoes, disease\u2026 all the big scary stuff that was random and deadly not that long ago. Having those things explained helps take some of the burden off of the need to use God to explain it. But there\u2019s something else.. it\u2019s not JUST science. It\u2019s community. When I was about 6 or 7 years old, I figured out that I didn\u2019t believe in God but I didn\u2019t know that my disbelief had a name or that anyone else thought like I did. I thought I was broken in some way. Everyone around me was a believer, or said they were. I didn\u2019t have any idea that I wasn\u2019t alone in my way of looking at God until MUCH later on, around 7th grade maybe? Religion was not talked about and it was assumed that you were Christian, or in very rare cases Jewish,and no one talked about anything past those two. I knew mythology said that people believed in other gods in the past but it was all treated like fairy tales for children. Foolish people that followed false Gods because they didn\u2019t know any better.I didn\u2019t even run across the word Atheist until I was reading through a college library in the world religions section trying to figure out just what I believed in, my mom\u2019s idea so that I would stop pestering her with questions she couldn\u2019t answer. But now, kids have all of the internet at their fingertips. They have access to people from all around the world and all those viewpoints and religions. AND, they get a chance to know these other people before someone can inform that that these \u201cothers\u201d are bad or evil. They get to be friends on Facebook or in games or on message boards and chat rooms. They get to see that this other kid, that likes the same things they like, just doesn\u2019t have the same god or sees it all in a different way, and it\u2019s no big deal to them. Kids today have access to a global community. They aren\u2019t isolated in one small area of the world, in one geographic location with people just like their families.And as tolerance spreads with knowledge, then those that already were atheists or members of minority religions, can step out of the shadows and claim their own faith. Right now, we still have a backlash against atheists to deal with, but it\u2019s getting better. I\u2019ve seen it get better in just my adult life. I\u2019m 50 now and just over 30 years ago, saying I was an Atheist was pretty much along the same lines as announcing I was barbecuing children or the family pet. Now, I can be an out and open Atheist and I rarely hear any comments against it. Well, not from the younger generation at least. Folks my age, 50, or older can still be difficult on occasion. But it gives me hope for the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Due to lack of divine knowledge, atheism is increasing. However, there is a powerful argument to bring the atheist to the line of spiritual knowledge so that the social evils can be controlled since atheists are also part of the society. Such powerful concept is 50-50 probability. I have not shown the existence of the hell, where the sin is punished in this universe. But, the atheist also has not shown the absence of hell in this infinite space. In this state of situation, there is 50-50 probability of existence and non-existence of God. The hell may exist because the atheist has not taken Me to the boundary of the universe and established the absence of hell. I also could not show the existence of the hell in this space and hence, the hell may not exist. In such case, the wisdom advises to believe the existence of hell to be on safe side. Some people say that there is fire and some others say that there is no fire in the path ahead and the walker is blind. If the blind walker is wise, he will take the probability of existence of fire from the 50-50 probability and go back. By going back, nothing is lost even if the fire is absent. By going forward, the leg may burn if the fire exists. Similarly, based on this concept of 50-50 probability, if the sins are not done, there is no loss even if the hell is absent. Moreover, in the absence of sin, there will be no stress and one can live with full mental peace and confidence, which are the foundation for happiness. If the sins are done and the hell is present, the punishment is terrible in the hell in addition to the tension in this world. By this concept, you can control the sin in the pravrutti at least in the case of an atheist. This 50-50 probability about God also initiates the atheists to do intensive analysis regarding God and hence, the nivrutti is also attained. In this way, you can maintain the balance and purity of the society without any sin even though atheist exists in the society. The logic of atheists is based on perception (Pratyaksha Pramana), which was propagated by the sage Charvaka. Perception means the knowledge derived from the observation with the naked eyes. Infact in the logic (Tarka Sastra) all the means of knowledge are based on perception only. In the inference (Anumana) also, the fire on the hill is inferred by its smoke. But the relationship between the fire and smoke is perceived with the naked eyes only. Similarly other means of knowledge are also based on the perception only. Thus Charvaka forms the basic of the entire logic and without logic there is no knowledge. The statement that the God is above logic must be proved only by perception. The divine miracles performed by the human form of Lord prove that there is a power above the logic. These miracles are seen by the naked eyes. The atheists must be allowed to prove whether the miracles are simply magic tricks. When they cannot prove, they must accept the existence of super power above the logic. If they do not accept this they are contradicting their own basis, which is the perception. The divine miracles are experienced by the devotees and the experience cannot be contradicted. If the experience is contradicted, the experience of the atheists is also contradicted. Therefore atheists must be open-minded and should not be conservative. If they are conservative they have no right to criticize the religious conservatism. The theory of Vedas and Bhagavath Gita never contradicts the perception and therefore the logic of atheists becomes the basis of the spiritual knowledge. The Lord comes in human form and this human form is perceived by the naked eyes. Even the miracles performed by demons establish the existence of super power. Therefore to convince the atheists the miracles of the Lord are not necessary. When they are convinced about the existence of the Super power (Maya), the possessor of the Super Power, the Lord, coming in human form must be also accepted because the form is seen by the naked eyes. The salvation is breakage of the bonds in this world. Since the bonds of this world exist based on the perception, the salvation is also existing based on the perception. Since the family members and the money are perceived by the eyes, the bonds with them are also perceived. Thus the salvation (Moksha) must be accepted by the atheists. A single bond with the human form of the Lord is called \u2018Saayujya\u2019 or \u2018Kaivalya\u2019. Since the human form is perceived, Sayujya or Kaivalya is also perceived and must be accepted by the atheists. The Bliss is derived by the devotee from the divine knowledge of the human form of the Lord. Therefore the Bliss is also true according to atheists. Thus the goal, the means to please the Lord (Sadhana) and the fruit of Sadhana (Moksha and Kaivalya) are perceived and exist in this world itself. Veda says \u2018Yat Saakshat Aparokshaat\u2019, \u2018Pratyagatmana Maikshat\u2019 which mean that the Lord in human form is perceived by the naked eyes. Veda also says \u2018Ihachet Avedeet\u2019, which means that everything is true as seen in this world itself. This is called \u2018Jeevanmukthi\u2019, which means attaining the salvation while one is alive and not after death. The salvation after the death is not true because that has no basis of perception. Thus if the atheists are little bit patient and leave their aggressive nature of criticism, they are best fitted in the true spiritual knowledge of Vedas.
