            "answer_text": "Breakdown time\u2026 Ashkenazi Jews - These are the Jews who wound up in Germany, Poland, Russia, Hungary, Belarus, Lithuania, etc in medieval times, if not later. Their genome is predominantly Levantine (i.e. from the Jews of the Bible), usually ranging from 60\u201370 percent - sometimes more, sometimes less. The rest of their ancestry is southern European (mainly Greek and Roman), sub-Saharan African, and East Asian. Sephardi Jews - The Jews who settled in Spain and later North Africa (although some traveled north to Poland). They are genetically similar - if not nearly identical - to Ashkenazi Jews. Mizrahi Jews - The Jews who either settled in other parts of the Middle East, or remained in Israel. They are virtually identical to Ashkenazim and Sephardim in terms of genome. The only notable difference is that they lack Greco-Roman ancestry. Yemenite Jews, on the other hand, are genetically more Arab than Jewish. Indian Jews - They are about half-Levantine, half-South Asian. Latin American Jews - Most Central/South American Jews are of Sephardic extraction, although some are Ashkenazi. Refer back to those sections. North American, Australian, and British Jews - Most Jews in these countries are Ashkenazi, although there are exceptions. American Jews in particular are more assimilated than other diaspora Jews, so there is a good chance that many - if not most - American Jews you meet will have some European-American ancestry. I am one example of this. African and East Asian Jews - This is where the confusion sets in for most people. \u201cHUH? They look just like their neighbors! How could they be Middle Eastern?! They\u2019re not! Jews are just a religion!\u201d. And from there, they start questioning the veracity of our identity as an indigenous Middle Eastern people, or a people at all.African Jews assimilated to a far greater degree than other diaspora Jews, even more so than American Jews. There was no persecution, and therefore no real prohibition on intermarriage. For this reason, most African Jews bear more resemblance to their African neighbors than other Jews. They do, however, have Levantine descent: it\u2019s just significantly diluted.Chinese Jews assimilated *completely*, to the point that they\u2019ve only just recently rediscovered their Jewish roots. The Levantine ancestry is there, but as with African Jews, it is extremely diluted. Converts - Before I say anything about this, I\u2019d like to get one thing out of the way so there is no confusion. The vast, overwhelming majority of Jews are NOT converts. I cannot emphasize that enough. They amount to less than 1 percent of our entire people, if even that. In fact, most converts are just assimilated Jews who wanted to re-establish contact with their roots.That aside, unless a convert has pre-existing Jewish ancestry, they are - most likely - not of Levantine descent. Non-Jewish groupsPalestinians - Some Palestinians - particularly the Christian minority, and the Muslims of Nablus - have distant Jewish ancestry, but most do not. Genetically, they are closer to Saudis, Yemenis, and Bedouin than to Levantines. Samaritans - They are Israelites, but they do not descend from ancient Judaeans (Jews). Instead, their ancestry is derived from the northern Israelites of the Samaria/Shomron region. Genetically, they are a mix of Levantine (i.e. Israel) and Mesopotamian (i.e. Iraq), and are very closely related to diaspora Jews (especially Ashkenazim, Sephardim, and Mizrahim). Black Hebrew Israelites - They are a group of black-Americans, largely concentrated in NYC, who think *they* are the \u201ctrue descendants of the Israelites\u201d and that today\u2019s Jews are \u201cposeurs\u201d (although they seem to have an especially sharp hatred for Ashkenazim). Needless to say, their claims are not supported by any evidence, genetic or otherwise. The \u201cLost Tribes\u201d - Various groups throughout the world, including Japanese, Pashtuns, Native Americans, Hawaiians, etc, have been theorized as belonging to one of the lost tribes of Israel. These theories, although interesting, are not supported by evidence. TL;DR: Yes. Nearly all extant Jewish groups descend from the Jews of the Bible. This has been a scientifically established fact for 20 years now, although it had always been common knowledge before then. Antisemites, on the other hand, furiously reject any and all evidence proving the continuity between ancient Jews and today\u2019s Jews, as they desire badly - and I do mean BADLY - to delegitimize the State of Israel.

            "answer_text": "Whether or not they descend specifically from the Hebrews of a given time period, they definitely do have a majority of ancestry that come from West Levantine ancestors. You\u2019d be surprised about how much genetic similarity there exists between Lebanese, Palestinian and Jewish populations. In reality, Conquests and change of religion (per se) generally does not affect a populations genetic makeup in an extreme way. An army of 10,000 cannot hope to change the genetics of say hundreds of thousands, or millions of inhabitants. The only real way to change population genetics in an extreme way is by large scale migration, and is what happened with Europeans to America, with ships leaving everyday to the Americas. The countries in the Levant today whom call themselves Arab mostly do not descend from the true Arabs who are from the Gulf/Peninsular. The Palestinians today did not solely come from some large scale Arab migration, the ancient population of Southern Arabia was much less than that of the ancient population in the Levant, and still is today when you don\u2019t include the large foreign working population in the Gulf. The area the Palestinians were inhabiting was conquered by Arabs and a new religion and language was brought in, the same way the language and religion was brought to Syrians and Northern Iraqis, they don\u2019t speak Assyrian anymore (except for the Assyrian large minority), and the same way Egyptians don\u2019t speak the Coptic language anymore (except for the Coptic Egyptian large minority where priests speak it in Coptic churches). It\u2019s true that these minorities genetically represent their native ancestors more so than their majority counterparts due to far less likely intermarrying, however the dominant ancestry in the majority counterpart is still native. There was Arab migration from the Gulf into all these regions, but nowhere near the extent that it was over the existing population at the time. Today Syrians and North-Iraqis mainly descend from Mesopotamians such as Assyrians and Babylonians, Lebanese mainly descend from Phoenicians, etc and Jordanians will mainly descend from peoples such as the Moabites, etc. A whole part of what is now Lebanon was geographically in the ancient kingdom of Israel. Moreover, there was bound to be significantly numeric migrations between kingdoms between ancient Levantine populations. A study show that the frequency of paternal lineages (Y-DNA) of North-African Jews are almost equal to the frequencies both Palestinians and Lebanese have. Furthermore this paternal gene pool differs from other populations such as Arabs and Berbers. The largest study to date on the Jews of North Africa has been led by Gerard Lucotte et al. in 2003. This study showed that the Jews of North Africa showed frequencies of their paternal haplotypes almost equal to those of the Lebanese and Palestinian non-Jews. The authors also compared the distribution of haplotypes of Jews from North Africa with Sephardi Jews and Ashkenazi Jews and found significant differences between the Ashkenazim and the other two groups. The Jewish community of the island of Djerba in Tunisia is of special interest, Tradition traces this community's origins back to the time of the destruction of the First Temple. Two studies have attempted to test this hypothesis first by G. Lucotte et al. from 1993, the second of F. Manni et al. of 2005. They also conclude that the Jews of Djerba's paternal gene pool is different from the Arabs and Berbers of the island. Quoted from Genetic studies on Jews - Wikipedia which is referencing Y-chromosome DNA haplotypes in Jews: comparisons with Lebanese and Palestinians. (G. Lucotte et al.) Haplotype VIII of the Y chromosome is the ancestral haplotype in Jews. (G. Lucotte et al.) and A Y-chromosome portrait of the population of Jerba (Tunisia) to elu... (F. Manni et al.) . But before we go on, I want to make it very clear that both Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardic Jews have overwhelming counts of ancestry that traces back to West Levantine ancestors. The Y chromosome of most Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews contains mutations that are common among Middle Eastern peoples, but uncommon in the general European population, according to a study of haplotypes of the Y chromosome by Michael Hammer, Harry Ostrer and others, published in 2000. According to Hammer et al. this suggests that the paternal lineages of Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. Quoted from Genetic studies on Jews - Wikipedia which is referencing Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations share a common pool of Y-chromosome biallelic haplotypes (Hammer et al.) Two studies by Nebel et al. in 2001 and 2005, based on Y chromosome polymorphic markers, suggested that Ashkenazi Jews are more closely related to other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than to their host populations in Europe (defined in the using Eastern European, German, and French Rhine Valley populations). Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Kurdish Jews were all very closely related to the populations of the Fertile Crescent, even closer than to Arabs. Quoted from Genetic studies on Jews - Wikipedia which is referencing The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East (Nebel et al.) High-resolution Y chromosome haplotypes of Israeli and Palestinian Arabs reveal geographic substructure and substantial overlap with haplotypes of Jews (Nebel et al.) . Anyway, continuing on, Similarly, another study showed that the Y-chromosomes between a great percentage of modern day Palestinians and a great percentage of Jewish people are inherited from the same paternal ancestors from that Canaan region within the last few thousand years, meaning that Palestinians (and other Levant populations such as Lebanese), and many Jewish populations show identical subclades of the same parent Y-haplogroup. In a study of Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, more than 70% of the Jewish men and 82% of the Arab men whose DNA was studied, had inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors, who lived in the region within the last few thousand years. \"Our recent study of high-resolution microsatellite haplotypes demonstrated that a substantial portion of Y chromosomes of Jews (70%) and of Palestinian Arabs (82%) belonged to the same chromosome pool.\" Quoted from Genetic studies on Jews - Wikipedia which is referencing High-resolution Y chromosome haplotypes of Israeli and Palestinian Arabs reveal geographic substructure and substantial overlap with haplotypes of ... - PubMed - NCBI (Nebel et al.) and The Y chromosome pool of Jews as part of the genetic landscape of the Middle East. (Nebel et al.) . You may ask why there might be some physical differences between types of Jewish populations compared to Levantines if they have so much ancestry in common (although many actually look really similar). The answer is obvious and is because Jewish Diasporas can show mixture. Now whether it be European Jews, North African Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Yemenite Jews, etc, they can show a mixture traced to where that Jewish group is known to historically immigrate to, some more or less than others. This is apparent in virtually all Jewish Diasporas, an example is that a study concluded that 65%-81% of Ashkenazi Mt-DNA is European in origin, and only 8% confirmed of Middle Eastern origin. Note these are maternal lineages, as I showed before they still show a very much overwhelming majority of paternal lineages from the West Levant, so yes they have lots of ancestry from specifically the ancient Hebrews, but some differences physical features might be explained by the mixture Jewish populations may have obtained, as compared to your average Samaritan or Lebanese person, but really you\u2019d be surprised about the Levantine features you can find in these populations. A 2013 study at the University of Huddersfield, led by Professor Martin B. Richards, concluded that 65%-81% of Ashkenazi Mt-DNA is European in origin, including all four founding mothers, and that most of the remaining lineages are also European. The results were published in Nature Communications in October 2013. The team analyzed about 2,500 complete and 28,000 partial Mt-DNA genomes of mostly non-Jews, and 836 partial Mt-DNA genomes of Ashkenazi Jews. The study claims that only 8% of Ashkenazi Mt-DNA could be identified as Middle Eastern in origin, with the origin of the rest being unclear. In this study it is stated the \u201cbest estimate is to assign ~81% of Ashkenazi lineages to a European source, ~8% to the Near East and ~1% further to the east in Asia, with ~10% remaining ambiguous\u201d. Quoted from Genetic studies on Jews - Wikipedia referencing A substantial prehistoric European ancestry amongst Ashkenazi maternal lineages. (Costa et al.) and Genes Suggest European Women at Root of Ashkenazi Family Tree (Nicholas Wade 2013) . But again, this doesn\u2019t mean that Ashkenazi Jews and other Jews don\u2019t have a significant genetic link to the Hebrews, because as shown before Jews such as Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews are closely related to modern day Levantines. Having said that not all do such as Ethiopian Jews, whom show little to no genetic connection to ancient Levantine populations. You can read about this here. Genetic studies on Jews - Wikipedia. . Anyway back on topic, a study by (Doron et al.) published a diagram of genetic distances between many Jewish populations, Levant populations, the modern day Samaritans, Saudi and Bedouin populations, and Southern and Eastern European populations. (article doi:10.1038/nature09103)  Taking a look, you will see that Palestinians significantly overlap with Lebanese and Samaritan populations however have a skew towards Saudi populations which seems to confirm that they have a majority of Levantine ancestry with a smaller but significant true Arab mix. Samaritans today are direct descendants of the ancient Israelities (Samaritans - Wikipedia), and are shown to be extremely genetically close to Lebanese. You will also see how close different Jewish populations are to Levantines and also how regardless of the Diaspora shown, they stretch towards Levantine populations. .  This ancient map shows the kingdoms of the approximate region of Canaan (including Israel) in the 9th Century BC. Remember, a whole part of what is now Lebanon was geographically in the ancient kingdom of Israel. Where Palestinians just happened to live overlapped with these areas. So the answer is likely to some extent. From the data shown it still can\u2019t be said with 100% certainty that they directly descend from the Hebrews living in Israel exactly 2000 years ago (which I presume is the type of question you\u2019re specifically asking), having said that the only other possibility would be that they have a relatively recent common ancestor with them. Palestinians mostly have Levantine ancestry, and it is likely that at least a portion of that ancestry will be from the ancient Hebrews given their geographic location. A difference would be that the Muslim majority of Palestinians have a clear mixture from the southern (true) Arabs too, and that Jewish groups have admixture from whether they historically fled to. However, I still need to stress the fact that most Jewish ethnoreligious groups like Askenazi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Yemenite Jews are descendants of the ancient Hebrew Israelites. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is a \u201cred herring\u201d to understanding the fundamental difference between Palestinians and Israelis in the modern seventy year Palestine-Israeli conflict. The question focuses attention on the genetic difference between Palestinians and Hebrews, suggesting that the land of Palestine/Judea/Israel(I will use Palestine in this answer) gave birth to distinct ancestral and/or genetic ethnic group(s). This is factually untrue, as the peoples of modern day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine - collectively called the Levant - are all ethnically one group. The historical name for the Levant region before the rise of the Jewish religion in Palestine during roughly the last millennium of the bronze age (1200-1000 BCE), is Canaan. The Pharaohs did not know of any ethnic differences amongst the inhabitants of the Levant during their 3000 year history, as Judaism arose during the end period of Pharaonic Egypt (New Kingdom Egypt 1500\u20131000 BCE). Therefore, the rise and evolution of the Jewish religion in the Palestine region of the Levant is a function of cultural change amongst the inhabitants of that area of the region, rather than the rise of or immigration to the area of a distinct or new ethnic group. The Jewish community over time matured to have distinct practices (dietary, circumcision, ritual practices, beliefs, etc) that separated them from the surrounding Canaanite peoples in the Levant. This community would form two kingdoms in Palestine that would last for several hundred years during roughly the periods of 1000\u2013500 BCE - in the north of Palestine Israel, and the south Judea. These nations were occupied by expanding empires from Mesopotamia, first the Assyrian and later the Babylonian empires. Finally, the expanding Persian empire (500 -300 BCE roughly) would occupy the entire Western Asian area, including Palestine and Egypt. During the period of Jesus Christ between around 100 BC and onwards, the Levant became a province of the Roman Empire. The Romans respected the unique cultural and religious heritage of Judaism that had evolved in Palestine over 1000 years and administered the area as province Judea - separate from the rest of Canaan, which they administered as Syria. Several revolts by the Jewish inhabitants of Judea against the Roman Empire in the first to second century of the common era (0\u2013200 CE) led to extremely violent repressions by the Imperial Roman army, leading to a worldwide exodus of Jewish communities. Finally, the Romans decided to change the name of the province to its Greek name Palestine, and administrate Palestine in combination with Syria. The total Levant province was named and administered as Syria Palestine. Despite the violent reprisals by the Roman imperial army, the Jewish inhabitants of Judea were never completely wiped out, and the population eventually grew again. Keep in mind, at its maximum population in the pre industrial era, Palestine can only hold up to 1.2 million people. Syrian Palestine was not immune to the growth of Christianity in the Roman Empire, and had a sizeable minority population of Christians by the time Constantine made Christianity the official imperial religion (around 330 CE). By the time the Eastern Roman Empire is administered separately through Constantinople as the Byzantine Empire, Christianity is the majority religion in Palestine, with a sizeable Jewish minority (by the 6th century CE). When the Muslims arrive in Syria Palestine, they establish Islam as the official state religion. Nevertheless, it would take several hundred years for Islam to become a majority religion in the province. Islam is the majority religion in the province by the time the Ottomans begin to administer the Levant in 1500s CE. Up until the arrival of the Zionists in Palestine in the early 20th century and their later disruption of the endogenous demographic patterns through the creation of Israel, the demographics of Palestine reflected these historical trends. Majority (to this day) of Palestinians (80%) are Sunni Muslims, with around 20 percent Orthodox Christians. Before the arrival of Zionist settlers there were also spread through out Palestine endogenous Jewish communities, and also other religious communities such as the Druze. Genetic studies that have been performed since their advent in 1990s on Palestinians, Israelis, and other Levantine groups confirm these historical trends. Palestinians are shown to be the closest relatives to the Israeli population, though the Israeli population also shows significant admixture from the diaspora communities (mostly European DNA). The Palestinians and Israelis are closely related to the Lebanese, Jordanian, and Syrian genetic groups, forming one large Levantine family grouping as we would expect from the historical narrative. The modern day conflict between Palestinians and Israelis is about the culture, religion, and language identity of Palestine. However, the Palestinians also argue that given they are the continuous inhabitants of the land throughout history (as the Israeli population is an accumulation of the international Jewish diaspora), they also have a non negotiable direct right to their lands and homes from which they were forced out in both 1948 and 1967 conflicts.

            "answer_text": "No, they are not. Similarities in gene pools with other Semitic peoples mean nothing in determining a Jew. Judaism is a religion, and its descendants have been determined through communities of shared faith, and the lineages they produce. Sharing a common ancestor, even in Abraham, does not make an Arab into a Jew, as Judaism began with Abraham\u2019s grandson, Jacob. Yishmael was Jacob\u2019s uncle; they certainly had genetic similarities! But that did not make Yishmael a Jew: Yishmael was an Arab, and Jacob was a Jew. That\u2019s the degree of specificity the Torah requires in determining a Jew from Arab. So an Arab is not a Jew, no matter how similar their genes are. Jacob\u2019s children were the first Jews, and comprised the 12 tribes of Israel. And Jacob was the first forefather of Judaism to be called Israel. Only those who shared the faith of Jacob and transmitted it downward to their children and to all successive generations were considered Jews. (As well as converts of other nations, who introduced a measure of genetic variety into the Jewish gene pool. Which again shows you, it\u2019s faith based, not simply gene based.) Also, the name Judaism comes from Judah, son of Jacob. That in itself is proof that to be Jewish, you must be from descended from Jacob and his particular faith. Not any other semitic people, no matter what your ancestry dna test results reveal. ",

            "answer_text": "Difficult to answer.The earliest population census that could be found, from back in the late 19th century, show that about 40\u201330% of the people that would become the forefathers of the Palestinians in the 20th century, were Christians. Cities such as Bethlehem and Ramallah were traditionally with Christian majority until very recently. Additionally, it is a known fact that many Muslim Palestinian families, especially in Nablus, originate from Samaritans that were still the majority in the Neblus region in the 16th century, when they were forced to convert to Islam by the Ottoman authorities.There are also some known, large \u201cfamilies\u201d (more of the size of tribes) of Palestinians with known Jewish origins that converted in the last 200\u2013300 years, such as the Yaish one in Nablus and M\u2019khamra in Hebron which are called \u201cYahud\u201d (Arabic for \u201cJewish\u201d) by their neighbors to these days.Genetic tests done on Christians in Lebanon shown that they mostly originate from the original Canaanite population, with minor Greek and Crusader contribution. I would say Palestinian Christians probably share similar historical origin, just with a twist of also probably originating from Hellenistic Jews, which were the first Christians.So if you look at the non-Jewish make up of the population back in the late 19th century, early 20th century, I would say that at least 50% of them had Jewish-Samaritan-Canaanite origins. The rest were probably later comers from all around the Levant.But after that, and especially in the early 20th century, this changes a lot. Many Arabs from neighboring regions immigrated into the region for four main reasons:1. Egyptian occupation in 1830s, brought in thousands of Egyptian soldiers. Some left after the Ottomans took it back, others stayed.2. After regained control of the land by the Ottomans in the 1840s, they wished to repopulate it with people that guarantee loyalty to Constantinople, so you see settlements by Circassians and Bosnians in the late 19th century, as well as Turkish families settling in the major cities (Jaffa and Jerusalem).3. Hijaz railway project. Up until 1908, when this project was complete, the journey from Damascus (the last stop of Ottoman railway) to Mecca and Medina, the holy cities for Islam for the purpose of Hajj (the Islamic yearly pilgrimage to those locations) took the lives of about 20% (!) of the pilgrims each year. They fell victims to thirst, hunger, disease, and had to pay tribute to different Bedouin tribes who made good profit out of it. This was the biggest engineering project in Ottoman history, was built by a German company, and cost 16 million dollars at the time (you can calculate how much it would be today). The Ottomans provided 10,000 soldiers just to secure the construction, but also a lot of working hands, and this also drawn more businesses to provide goods, services etc. to all the people which were involved in the project, which took almost a decade to complete. Most of them didn\u2019t leave after that.4. Zionist Jews and German Templars, which came starting the later half of the 19th century, really boosted the condition of the land, and needed working hands for agriculture etc. That too also offered lucrative opportunities to people from neighboring regions to relocate. This was further sped up after the British Mandate of Palestine began. Nowadays, these immigrants are numerous, I\u2019m not sure how many Palestinians can trace their families origins to the early 19th century these days, but many do not originate from the same \u201cstock\u201d of people as they did in that time. This can be seen by the last names of their families: Al-Kurd (Kurdish), Al-Bushnak (Bosnian), Al-Masri (the largest Palestinian family - meaning Egyptian), Zoabi (from Iraq), etc. ",

            "answer_text": "There is two ways of looking at the evidence, genetic and historic, and they do agree in supporting that Palestinians are one and the same. Firstly the historic element is captured in this excellent documentary, showing how they are one and the same: On the website of the film Searching for Exile: Truth or Myth (BBC4 Documentary)  \u201cFor centuries, Jews have lamented the destruction of their holy city Jerusalem and their temple by the Romans, which they believed was the beginning of their long 2000 years of exile. Exile is not only a religious Jewish belief but for millions of Jewish and non Jewish alike it is a historical fact. But what has been considered as fact for centuries is now being challenged by archeological evidence unearth across Israel. Here in the ancient town of Sepphoris just 70 miles from Jerusalem evidence points not to a people driven into exile but on the contrary to a population that not only survived but flourished. So why has exile been seen as a reality for thousands of years? and if it did not take place exactly as told, then what accounts for the millions of Jews who over the centuries have settled around the world? and perhaps the inevitable question, what happened to the inhabitants of places like Sepphoris who were never exiled. Until 1948 a predominantly Muslim Palestinian village stood on the ruins of Sepphoris, the village was destroyed and its inhabitants barred from returning. Is it possible that some of the Palestinian residents are descendants of ancient Jews who were never exiled?\u201d The Jewish kingdoms were only one of many periods in ancient Palestine \u201cThe extended kingdoms of David and Solomon, on which the Zionists base their territorial demands, endured for only about 73 years...Then it fell apart...[Even] if we allow independence to the entire life of the ancient Jewish kingdoms, from David\u2019s conquest of Canaan in 1000 B.C. to the wiping out of Judah in 586 B.C., we arrive at [only] a 414 year Jewish rule.\u201d Illene Beatty, \u201cArab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.\u201d Secondly they are more or less genetically identical to their Palestinian brethren: The shared genetic heritage of Jews and Palestinians\u201cWhat they revealed was that Arabs and Jews are essentially a single population, and that Palestinians are slap bang in the middle of the different Jewish populations (as shown in this figure).  Another team, lead by Almut Nebel at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, took a closer look in 2001. They found that Jewish lineages essentially bracket Muslim Kurds, but they were also very closely related to Palestinians. In fact, what their analysis suggested was that Palestinians were identical to Jews, but with a small mix of Arab genes \u2013 what you would expect if they were originally from the same stock, but that Palestinians had mixed a little with Arab immigrants. They conclude: We propose that the Y chromosomes in Palestinian Arabs and Bedouin represent, to a large extent, early lineages derived from the Neolithic inhabitants of the area and additional lineages from more-recent population movements. The early lineages are part of the common chromosome pool shared with Jews (Nebel et al. 2000). According to our working model, the more-recent migrations were mostly from the Arabian Peninsula\u2026 So, as far as male lineage goes, the genetic story is very clear. Palestinians and Jews are virtually indistinguishable.\u201d A Problematic Reading of the Genetic History of the Jews \u201cOstrer also exhibits a disappointing proclivity for overreading the import of his findings for contemporary geopolitical dilemmas. This is why readers will be troubled by Ostrer\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe stakes in genetic analysis are high,\u201d because genetic evidence lies at \u201cthe heart of Zionist claims for a Jewish homeland in Israel.\u201d \u201cThis is a problematic assertion for several reasons, of which the simplest is that Ostrer conflates the claim to a national homeland made by pre-state Jewish nationalists and the right to sovereignty on the part of an existing nation state. More troubling is Ostrer\u2019s assertion that investigation of where one\u2019s ancestors lived upwards of 2000 years ago is relevant to the rights of nations-a standard that would leave few contemporary nation states on firm footing\u201d \u201cA thornier problem is that Ostrer, like many research physicians, takes genetic data to be more scientific, and therefore more definitive, than they are. Genetically described populations reflect probabilistic clusters of markers inscribed in our DNA. They are not a concretization of race. Moreover, many of the conclusions that can be drawn from genetic evidence are reliant on the quality of accompanying historical data. For example, the Cohen modal haplotype is a cluster of distinctive genetic markers shared by a high percentage of contemporary Jewish Cohanim (the priestly clan that traces its ancestry back to Moses\u2019 brother Aaron). The idea that the ancestry that these men share can be traced to the ancient Israelite priesthood makes sense to almost everyone who views these data, but it is not inherent in the data. The data show only that these men share common ancestors who lived a specified number of generations ago. Estimating when those ancestors lived depends on an educated guess about the length of an average generation during the last 3000 years or so. But the idea that those ancestors were Cohanim is derived from our knowledge of Jewish history, it is not inscribed in the genetic markers.\u201d And scientific research can be politically pressured - Journal axes gene research on Jews and Palestinians \u201cAcademics who have already received copies of Human Immunology have been urged to rip out the offending pages and throw them away. Such a drastic act of self-censorship is unprecedented in research publishing and has created widespread disquiet, generating fears that it may involve the suppression of scientific work that questions Biblical dogma\u201d \u201cOne of them said: 'If Arnaiz-Villena had found evidence that Jewish people were genetically very special, instead of ordinary, you can be sure no one would have objected to the phrases he used in his article. This is a very sad business.'\u201d So the evidence does point to them being the same people. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Ancient Hebrews are on of the ancestors of Palestinians. DNA studies have shown Palestinians have a closer relationship to ancient Israelis than today\u2019s modern Israelis do. \u201cAnother team, lead by Almut Nebel at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, took a closer look in 2001. They found that Jewish lineages essentially bracket Muslim Kurds, but they were also very closely related to Palestinians. In fact, what their analysis suggested was that Palestinians were identical to Jews, but with a small mix of Arab genes \u2013 what you would expect if they were originally from the same stock, but that Palestinians had mixed a little with Arab immigrants. They conclude: We propose that the Y chromosomes in Palestinian Arabs and Bedouin represent, to a large extent, early lineages derived from the Neolithic inhabitants of the area and additional lineages from more-recent population movements. The early lineages are part of the common chromosome pool shared with Jews (Nebel et al. 2000). According to our working model, the more-recent migrations were mostly from the Arabian Peninsula\u2026 So, as far as male lineage goes, the genetic story is very clear. Palestinians and Jews are virtually indistinguishable. M. F. Hammer (2000).

Tevet 7, 5779 Time in Israel: 11:00 PM Science & Health Blood Brothers: Palestinians and Jews Share Genetic Roots Jews break down into three genetic groups, all of which have Middle Eastern origins \u2013 which are shared with the Palestinians and Druze. Josie Glausiusz Blood brothers: Palestinians and Jews share genetic roots Confronted by the violence sweeping over Israel, it can be easy to overlook the things that Jews and Palestinians share: a deep attachment to the same sliver of contested land, a shared appetite for hummus, a common tradition of descent from the patriarch Abraham, and, as scientific research shows - a common genetic ancestry, as well. Several major studies published in the past five years attest to these ancient hereditary links. At the forefront of these efforts are two researchers: Harry Ostrer, professor of pediatrics and pathology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, New York, and Karl Skorecki, director of medical and research development at the Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa. Back in June 2010, and within two days of each other, the two scientists and their research teams published extensive analyses of the genetic origins of the Jewish people and their Near East ancestry. \u201cThe closest genetic neighbors to most Jewish groups were the Palestinians, Israeli Bedouins, and Druze in addition to the Southern Europeans, including Cypriots,\u201d as Ostrer and Skorecki wrote in a review of their findings that they co-authored in the journal Human Genetics in October 2012. \u201cKarl and I are good friends,\u201d Ostrer told Haaretz by telephone from New York. \u201cWe used somewhat different analytical methods\u2014there\u2019s no claim there for superiority, or one side versus the other.\u201d In their results, as well, \u201cthere was really very little difference at all.\u201d Ostrer\u2019s research on \u201cAbraham\u2019s Children in the Genome Era,\u201d published in The American Journal of Human Genetics, sampled 652,000 gene variants from each of 237 unrelated individuals from seven Jewish populations: Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi. These sequences were then compared with reference samples from non-Jews drawn from The Human Genome Diversity Project, a global database of genetic information gathered from populations across the world. Each of the Jewish populations, they found, \u201cformed its own distinctive cluster,\u201d indicating their shared ancestry and \u201crelative genetic isolation.\u201d Ostrer\u2019s team also identified two major groups of Jews: Middle Eastern Jews (Iranian and Iraqi) and European/Syrian Jews. The split between these two groups of Jews occurred some 2,500 years ago. Cousins with the Druze and French Both groups of Jews shared ancestry with contemporary Middle Eastern and Southern European populations. The closest genetic relatives of the Middle Eastern Jews are Druze, Bedouin and Palestinians. The closest genetic relatives of the European group of Jews are Northern Italians, followed by Sardinians and French. In a 2012 study, Ostrer identified North African Jews as a third major group. In Skorecki\u2019s study on the genome-wide structure of the Jewish people, published in the journal Nature, he and his fellow researchers sampled tens of thousands of genetic variants from the genomes of 121 individuals hailing from 14 Jewish Diaspora communities, and compared these variants with samples drawn from 1,166 individuals from 69 Old World non-Jewish populations. They found that Jews from the Caucasus (Azerbaijan and Georgia), the Middle East (Iran and Iraq) North Africa (Morocco) and Sephardi and Ashkenazi communities, as well as Samaritans, form a \u201ctight cluster\u201d that overlaps with Israeli Druze. This, the authors write, \u201cis consistent with an ancestral Levantine contribution to much of contemporary Jewry.\u201d In addition, a \u201ccompact cluster\u201d of Yemenite Jews \u201coverlaps primarily with Bedouins but also with Saudi individuals.\u201d Ethiopian and Indian Jews are more closely related to their own neighboring, host populations. Middle East origins in European Jews Further evidence for the Middle Eastern origins of Ashjenazi Jews came from a study published in 2014: In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is \u201can even mix\u201d of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations\u2014suggesting, as Carmi writes on the web site of The Ashkenazi Genome Consortium (TAGC), \u201ca sex-biased process, where, say, Middle-Eastern Jewish men married European non-Jewish women.\u201d Are these genetic ties between Jews, Palestinians, Bedouin, and Druze important in a contemporary context? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me personally,\u201d Skorecki says, \u201csince I think that global human identity supersedes all other considerations.\u201d \u201cWe want to know who we are and where we came from,\u201d Ostrer, who is now studying cancer risks among Ashkenazi Jews and Northern Israeli Druze populations, sums up. Even so, shared ancestry doesn\u2019t necessarily imply a special bond. As Ostrer notes, citing the Biblical tale of Cain and Abel, \u201cthe fact that people are related to one another doesn\u2019t prevent their developing extreme hostility to one another.\u201d Josie Glausiusz Haaretz Contributor show identical subclades of the same parent Y-haplogroup. In a study of Israeli Jews and Palestinian Muslim Arabs, more than 70% of the Jewish men and 82% of the Arab men whose DNA was studied, had inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors, who lived in the region within the last few thousand years. \"Our recent study of high-resolution microsatellite haplotypes demonstrated that a substantial portion of Y chromosomes of Jews (70%) and of Palestinian Muslim Arabs (82%) belonged to the same chromosome pool.\" Quote from Genetic studies on Jews - Wikipedia which is referencing High-resolution Y chromosome haplotypes of Israeli and Palestinian Arabs reveal geographic substructure and substantial overlap with haplotypes of ... - PubMed - NCBI (Nebel et al.) and The Y chromosome pool of Jews as part of the genetic landscape of the Middle East. (Nebel et al.) Biblical bad guys the ancient Philistines came from Europe, DNA shows One DNA study by Nebel found substantial genetic overlap among Israeli and Palestinian Arabs and Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. A small but statistically significant difference was found in the Y-chromosomal haplogroup distributions of Sephardic Jews and Palestinians, but no significant differences were found between Ashkenazi Jews and Palestinians nor between the two Jewish communities, However, a highly distinct cluster was found in Palestinian haplotypes. 32% of the 143 Arab Y-chromosomes studied belonged to this \u201cI&P Arab clade\u201d, which contained only one non-Arab chromosome, that of a Sephardic Jew. This could possibly be attributed to the geographical isolation of the Jews or to the immigration of Arab tribes in the first millennium.[179] Nebel proposed that \u201cpart, or perhaps the majority\u201d of Muslim Palestinians descend from \u201clocal inhabitants, mainly Christians and Jews, who had converted after the Islamic conquest in the seventh century http://AD\u201d.In a 2003 genetic study, Bedouins showed the highest rates (62.5%) of the subclade Haplogroup J-M267 among all populations tested, followed by Palestinian Arabs (38.4%), Iraqis (28.2%), Ashkenazi Jews (14.6%) and Sephardic Jews (11.9%), according to Semino et al.[181] Semitic populations, including Jews, usually possess an excess of J1 Y chromosomes compared to other populations harboring Y-haplogroup J.[181][182][183][184][185] 2002 test by Tel Aviv University researchers, determined that only two groups in the world \u2013 Ashkenazi Jews and Palestinians \u2013 were genetically susceptible to an inherited deafness syndrome. All the studies he cites in his book, says Misinai, show that \u201cthe Palestinians are genetically much closer to Ashkenazi Jews than they are to the Arabs.\u201d Haplogroup J1 (Y-DNA) includes the modal haplotype of the Galilee Arabs[177] and of Moroccan Arabs[187] and the sister modal haplotype of the Cohanim, the \u201cCohan Modale Haplotype\u201d, representing the descendants of the priestly caste Aaron.[188][189][190] ",

            "answer_text": "No, they are not. They are also not descendants of the ancient people known in the Hebrew bible as PELISHTIM. These ancient people were invaders, as their name tells us, and they probably spoke Greek since their cities contained a lot of Greek style pottery. They were also called the sea people. They may have been from the Minoan culture, and the Hebrew bible says that these people originated in Kaphtor, which is probably modern day Cyprus. The Arab people living inside the land of Israel came from various places, including Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and former kingdom of Hejaz which is now Saudia. Today, it is common for Arabs from Jordan to cross the border while the soldiers turn their heads the other way, and it was the same both before the state of Israel existed and after its founding as well. The Romans decided to punish the Jews after the last revolt, and they renamed both Jerusalem and the country of Judea with names to erase the Jews from our own history. Jerusalem was renamed Aeolia Capitolina, and Judea was renamed Palestina. Shechem was renamed Naples, or Nablus, as the Arabs call it today. A few Arabs were living here a century ago, and they form maybe ten or twenty percent of the present Arab population in the country. I consider the very use of this name for a fictional people, popularized since the 1960\u2019s, instead of a geographical region, to be antisemitic [ and I mean anti-Jewish ]. ",

            "answer_text": "Although there are stories of Jewish villages having been converted to Islam centuries ago, modern Palestinians are not so much descendants of ancient Hebrews/Israelites as that both ancient Israelites and the Palestinians\u2019 ancestors were Canaanites, who spoke Canaanite language (a Semitic language spoken by Phoenicians, Israelites, Ammonites, Edomites, Moabites, etc.). Genetic studies have shown that there is great continuity of that Canaanite genetic heritage during the past several thousand years. For example, even though the Muslim conquest brought many Arabs through the area, and even though many other conquerors have since come through the region, around 90% of modern Lebanese DNA is shared with that of the ancient Canaanites. See in particular Marc Haber, et al., \u201cContinuity and Admixture in the Last Five Millennia of Levantine History from Ancient Canaanite and Present-Day Lebanese Genome Sequences,\u201d American Journal of Human Genetics, published online: July 27, 2017 = AJHG, 101/2 (Aug 3, 2017):274-282 (DOI: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.06.013), online at Continuity and Admixture in the Last Five Millennia of Levantine History from Ancient Canaanite and Present-Day Lebanese Genome Sequences .

            "answer_text": "Good question and there are quite a few ways to look at this.. I will give my two-bit input to this discussion. I live in the very center of the Galilee, which for centuries was quite separate from the rest of the country and on the other hand, yet was not sealed off from the world. If one looks at the history of the last 200\u2013250 years, it is clear that quite a few places within the Galilee were populated by incomers from all over and region The presence of Bedouins in the coastal area, in the upper Jordan valley and along the Jezreel valley is an illustration of the inflow of populations centuries ago and in this case, we know that Bedouins are not local to these areas and originally come from the Arabian Peninsula. Another example for incoming migration is those brought in (or infiltrated) the land during the British mandate. For instance, when the British decided to take the natural harbor of the Haifa bay and turn into a first class military grade port they needed working hands and a lot! Those were brought mostly from Northern Syria from Haran (also known as the area from which Abraham the Patriarch came) and nowadays, the local Arab slang word of \u201cHorani\u201d refers to a simpleton or a coolie, referring to those coming from Haran\u2026 Before their arrival, Haifa was a small place, populated mostly by Christian Arabs and some Muslims too\u2026 Nowadays, most of the Arab population in Haifa is Muslim\u2026 No need to be Einstein to realize those coolies did not return home once the port was up and running\u2026 Another example of such coolie work migrants settling the land are those that the British brought in from the Basra area in Iraq to build the Acre-Safed road. Needless to say they all stayed here with their families\u2026 Another example are the Druze who arrived in the Galilee from Egypt via Jabl Druze in Syria\u2026 OK, that was around 1200 AD, yet they are not quite related to the original pre-exile Israelite population. Nevertheless, there are big clusters of population that are definitely Jewish in origin and they do not try to hide this. For instance, there is the line of settlements in the Sakhnin valley (Deir Hana, \u2018Arabe and Sakhnin.) Sakhnin is mentioned in the Talmud as one of the places where the Sanhedrin (the Jewish \u201cparliament\u201d of ancient times) resided for some time and many ultra-religious Jewish groups visit ancient graves in \u2018Arabe\u2026 There are other such places around the Galilee, such as Jeish (Ancient Gush Halav) and Tiberis where you can see how the line passes throughout history from modern times to ancient Israel. A friend of mine who got really pissed off after the October 2000 mini-uprising that got some of his very good Arab friends severe ties with him till the uprising was crashed (they came by to beg his forgiveness afterwards), took a camera and his Nova Scotian accent and appearance and roamed most of the Galilee, looking for the elders and picked their memory and all in all, according to him, about half of the Arab population in the Galilee are relatively or definitely new comers to the area. But all this is not that important\u2026 When I did my BA in political science, in one of the courses I learned that neither ethnicity, religion, language, nor history (and some other criteria I fail to remember) define a people. The only thing that defines a people is self-determination. So even if 100% would be originated from the dwellers of Ancient Israel and Judea, this is irrelevant if they see themselves as part of an opposing people that defies the actual legitimacy of the self-defined and publicly acknowledged descendants of the Israelite entities of Biblical and Classic eras\u2026 ",

Palestine is a geographic region named by the Romans after the enemies of the Jews - Philistines. There was never an ethnicity of \u201cpalestinian\u201d there was never a country called palestine, there was never a palestinian language, or a currency, or a king or ruler, or a coded law - there is nothing. Palestine is a region - not a country or a race, so the answer to both DIFFERENT QUESTIONS is yes and no, there may be people who lived in palestine who were descendents of Canaanites, there may be people there who are Jewish descent, there are others not even connected to the area who migrated there from surrounding countries.

            "answer_text": "The Palestinians are descendants of various groups that have lived in Palestine/Israel during the millenia, including the Jews. People have been moving back and forth during the millenia, particularly in such a volatile region like the Middle East. Many times you will read nonsense like that there are no such thing as Palestinians. You might just as well say that there are no such thing as Arabs (or Jews). This is really just a game with words. All ethnicities are social constructs made at some time or another. In fact the term Palestinian is more precise than the term Arab. Many people, particularly many Zionists, seem to think Arab is one unitary mass of people and that al their ancestors came from Arabia. Of course, the truth is that people living in Palestine over the centuries have become linguistically assimilated. The reason why some are eager to deny that the Palestinans descend from the Hebrews is that these people think that this question is important for the right to the land of Israel/Palestine. Of course it is not. Israel\u00b4s right to exist is based on the decision of the United Nations decision to establish the state and later acceptance of the borders of the state. A religious book written by those who established the religion does of course not give the right to the land. Neither is that right based on DNA. This answer to a similar question is also relevant: Someone anonymous's answer to Who were the ancestors of most of the Palestinians currently living in Gaza and West Bank? Were they Jewish? If not, who were they? ",

            "answer_text": "The key to the answer is a demographic analysis of the region in the 19th and early 20th century. The data are scant and probably even distorted, but there is some impartial research on the issue. Here are two sources: The first is by Fred M. Gottheil - a professor in the department of economics, University of Illinois The Smoking Gun: Arab Immigration into Palestine, 1922-1931 Here are some quotes: \u201cIt is not surprising then that the British census data produce an Arab Palestinian population growth for 1922\u20131931 that turns out to be generated by natural increase and legal migrations alone. Applying a 2.5 per annum growth rate to a population stock of 589,177 for 1922 generates a 1931 population estimate of 735,799 or 97.6 percent of the 753,822 recorded in the 1931 census. Does the imputation model then \"prove\" that illegal immigration into Palestine was inconsequential during 1922\u20131931? Not at all. A footnote accompanying the census's population time series acknowledges the presence in Palestine of illegal Arab immigration. But because it could not be recorded, no estimate of its numbers was included in the census count. Ignoring illegal migrants does not mean they don't exist. Setting illegal immigration into Palestine aside, the imputation model does generate substantial migrations of Arab Palestinians within Palestine itself and confirms what many demographers, historians, government administrators, and economists have alluded to: the migration of Arab Palestinians from villages, towns, and cities of low economic opportunity to villages, towns, and cities of higher economic opportunity.\u201d \u2026 \u201cTherein lies the ideological warfare concerning claims to territorial inheritance and national sovereignty. Contrary to McCarthy's findings or wishes, there is every reason to believe that consequential immigration of Arabs into and within Palestine occurred during the Ottoman and British mandatory periods. Among the most compelling arguments in support of such immigration is the universally acknowledged and practiced linkage between regional economic disparities and migratory impulses. The precise magnitude of Arab immigration into and within Palestine is, as Bachi noted, unknown. Lack of completeness in Ottoman registration lists and British Mandatory censuses, and the immeasurable illegal, unreported, and undetected immigration during both periods make any estimate a bold venture into creative analysis. In most cases, those venturing into the realm of Palestinian demography\u2014or other demographic analyses based on very crude data\u2014acknowledge its limitations and the tentativeness of the conclusions that may be drawn.\u201d The second is by Prof. Gideon M. Kressel Professor Emeritus of Cultural-Social Anthropology at the Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Dr. Reuven Aharoni Formerly, Department of Middle Eastern History at Haifa University http://jcpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Egypt2.pdf Their starting point is a declaration that was made on March 23, 2012, by the \u1e24amas minister of the interior and of national security Fathi \u1e24ammad, who slammed Egypt for not helping to prevent fuel shortages in the Gaza Strip: \u201cWho are the Palestinians? We have many families called al-Masri, whose roots are Egyptian! They may be from Alexandria, from Cairo, from Dumietta, from the north, from Aswan, from Upper Egypt. We are Egyptians; we are Arabs. We are Muslims. We are part of you [in mainland Egypt]. Egyptians! Personally, half my family is Egyptian \u2013 and the other half are Saudis.\u201d This intriguing declaration motivated them to conduct a large scale anthropological research on Bedouin tribes in the southern part of Israel. They found substantial evidence to immigration from Egypt to Palestine in the above mentioned period, and here is a quote from the research: \u201cEgypt can play a positive role in the dialogue for a genuine peace if it encourages its scholars to remember Egypt\u2019s native sons who participated in the long march of \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Egypt. Those peasants and Bedouin who crossed the Sinai to the Levant over the last century are part of their own recent historical narrative and heritage; yet, up until now, these documents have been left to yellow in unexamined archives. The last \u201cenemy\u201d of historical documentation is the mistaken postmodern assumption that scientific research can never be objective, and since we are all inherently biased there is no value to chronicling events. To date there still remain countless stories of immigration in the collective memory of the protagonists. Most stories have not been recorded for posterity, or narratives have been recorded but their voices have been hushed or sidelined as irrelevant \u2013 whether because of self-censorship, because historians have failed to recognize the narratives\u2019 importance in time, or because the struggle over the land imposes a form of censorship. Adamant positions about their right to the land, Palestine, were henceforth endorsed by the newly arrived Egyptian migrants. It resembles the attitudes of the veteran Arab residents of the land and of the arriving Jews with their historical claim. Muslims rely on the Islamic perception of fay\u2019e (pl. afy\u0101a), meaning a booty land conquered or otherwise gained by the Muslims that should, therefore, remain part of the Umma\u2019s real estate for years to come. Despite the passing years, recollection of one\u2019s country of origin is a widespread motif. The histories of immigrants who have arrived in Palestine from its neighboring Middle Eastern lands are largely stored in families\u2019 memorials and are related on occasion to their offspring and friends.\u201d The bottom line is that in 1948 a significant part (if not the majority) of the Palestinian population in Palestine were immigrants from other Arab countries. In parallel the grand majority of the Jewish population in Palestine were immigrants mainly from Europe. This is an historical conclusion, but the crucial question for the present is how Jews and Arabs that live in Israel and Palestine can find ways to live together peacefully. ",

You need also documents from sources ranging from the dominant forces that controlled the region. From the research done toward genetics of the Palestinians According to a 2010 study by Behar et al. titled \"The genome-wide structure of the Jewish people\", Palestinians tested clustered genetically close to Bedouins, Jordanians and Saudi Arabians which was described as \"consistent with a common origin in the Arabian Peninsula\". [157] In the same year a study by Atzmon and Harry Ostrer a significant overlap of Y chromosomal haplogroups between Israeli and Palestinian Arabs with Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jewish populations and concluded that the Palestinians were, together with Bedouins, Druze and southern European groups, the closest genetic neighbors to most Jewish populations. [158] In the end there is no jewish gene. The jewish gene was the same genes as the canaanites and the rest of the Levantines well prior to the muslim conquests, arab settlements, african slave trade as well European admixture. Here is another study done figuring out how many jews converted to christianity when it was it's early years In this study I have engaged in a speculative calculation of many Jews were converted to the Christian movement in the first century. It was argued that the numbers of native-born Jews in this movement probably never exceeded 1 000 at any time. The Law-observant mission of the Jerusalem church, despite the witness of Acts, was hardly a success. It may have enjoyed some conversions in its initial years, but following the departure of the Hellenists from Jerusalem it struggled to attract new members in its city of residence. Its numbers were probably never more than 500. The other major Christian Jewish centre, the Antiochene church after 49, achieved no better results in its Jewish mission. The original Law-free Hellenist mission to the Jews fared no better, either in Jerusalem or in the Diaspora. The failure of the Hellenists to make a significant impact upon the Jews probably led to their decision to take the gospel to the Gentiles, a move which proved much more successful. Paul carried on this policy once he left Antioch, and Jewish conversions to the Law-free gospel all but dried up. The destruction of the Jerusalem church during the Jewish war decimated the numbers of Christians of Jewish background, and only a few hundred remained by the end of the century. One can only conclude that the Christian mission to the Jews was a dismal failure (Jervell 1984:26). Just how unsuccessful it was is revealed by the following figure. If at best the Christian movement contained only 1 000 members of Jewish origin at any point in time, then this represented a mere 0.0166 per cent of the total Jewish population in antiquity, working on the accepted figure of six million Jews (or 10 per cent of the ancient world) in the first century (McKnight 1993:11). While it is true that the proportion of Gentile Christians to Gentiles in the Roman Empire was also small at this stage, we know that Gentile membership expanded considerably in the ensuing centuries. The same is not true of Jewish membership. How many Jews became Christians in the first century?

And they were from Crete. Today \u201cpalestinians\u201d are calling themselves with this name since 60\u00b4s, only for political purpose. They are Arabs. Palestinians no longer exist. Jordanians are also Arabs. Syrians are also Arabs. Egyptians are also Arabs etc. etc. I wonder, how many states Arabs need. When Roman empire occupied ancient Israel, Israelis rebelled against them, several times. No empire likes it. So as revenge, Romans RENAMED Israel lands (Judea, Samaria etc.) after Israelis biggest enemies - Palestinians - Palestine. Imagine your country to be renamed by your occupants after your nation biggest enemy. That is simply disgusting. But since then, people call Israel land as Palestine, which is totally wrong. For example, Japan several times attempted to colonize Korea, occupy Korea and they occupied Korea in 20th century for 35 years. Imagine, that Japan would at that time renamed Korea as e.g. \u201c South Japan\u201d. Would it make Korea \u201cSouth Japan\u201d? No, of course not. Would it make sense to call Korea as \u201cSouth Japan\u201d? No, of course it wouldn\u00b4t make any sense. If in the mean time, Japanese people as nation disappeared, not matter in which way (this is nothing against Japan, it\u00b4s only hypothetical example) and people would call Koreans as Japanese. Would they make them Japanese? Of course not. So don\u00b4t call Arabs as \u201cpalestinians\u201d.             ",

So many people assert this, not because they are interested in the academic minutiae of ancient history, but to justify the robbery, murder, dispossession, expulsion and denial of all civil rights, including voting rights, from Israel\u2019s subject race. In the first place, it\u2019s not true, with genetic research at Hebrew University indicating the Palestinians are related to Jews, with the two separating only 5000 years ago. In the second place, if a German nationalist suggested German Jews should be denied the vote because they\u2019re allegedly recent arrivals, these commenters would be the first to declare in outrage that he was an anti-Semite.

            "answer_text": "Without a doubt the Arabs are the descendants of the Northern Kingdom Israel (among other ethnicities). On a Biblical History they were scattered throughout the Middle East and the Kingdom of the Medes (Pakistan and Afghanistan). The Biblical History of the ancient Kingdom has no love between Israel and Judah (the Kingdom of the Jews) According to the Biblical Account Ephraim was occupied by Judah from King Abijah and didn\u2019t get their freedom until Israel invaded just prior to King Jeroboam II, roughly 175 years. In the end Judah used the gold in the temple to sell Israel to the Assyria. Judah established a slave trade of Israelites from King Manasseh until their fall and was the primary reason Jeremiah condemned Judah. The Jews destroyed their temple in Bethel and sacrificed their priests on their own altar. The two groups even then were bitter enemies that wanted nothing to do with one another. On a Biblical Account according to Chronicles 5:2 the Abrahamic Blessing went to Joseph and the North Kingdom. If one believes in the promise of Abraham the Arabs are many nations from the Nile to the Euphrates, just as promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Joseph. The term Hebrew in the Bible is Greek, Hebrew in Hebrew is Abree (the children of Abram) while Arabee or Arab aka the children of Abraham. Of course they are also a mixture of many peoples, but without a doubt one of those is Joseph and ancient Israel. Of course as we are discussing identities, one may wish to note that Edom (Esau) was forced to convert of Judaism during the time of the Maccabbees, and joined with the Jews against Rome in 70AD. After 70AD they completely dropped the Edom title and became exclusively Jewish in terms of identification. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I am weighing in on this after you have 52 answers already. I have to say that I am impressed with the scholarship of many of the answers and have learned a lot from the answers to your question. My response here is concerning biblical genealogy. When we follow the Bible timeline we see that Noah gets off the ark with his Three Sons named Shem ham and japheth. Because Shem takes leadership in following God he becomes the blessed one through whom Messiah will eventually come. but that is not going to happen for many years to come and much history must take place before that. Indeed almost immediately the World falls into gross sin again and turns their back on their past creator / future savior. The Bible tells us that they gathered together into one place and build for them a tower so as to reach unto the heavens. This was so wrong for the early world population on so many levels but basically because it defied God's command to spread out and repopulate the Earth. we are told in Genesis chapter 11 that God visits this ungodly spectacle and gives the various tribes different languages. Heber is a great-grandson to Shem and he is alive during this time. hence the language given to him is called Hebrew and he becomes the ancient patriarch of all Hebrews. Eventually his descendants had many children among whom are both Arabs and Jews. All are of Semitic (or shemetic) origen as well as of Hebrew origin. but the battle starts around the time of Abraham when God decides to favor the sons of Jacob whom he names Israel and gives them the promised land along the levant that we now know of as the nation of Israel. So yes according to the Bible Palestinians and Jews are very closely related. And it has been very encouraging to read the scholarly data that backs this up. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a tough one but I\u2019ll give it a shot.Following the final destruction of the Jewish state in 135 CE,the land was pretty much destroyed and the pre-existing Jewish population was mostly-though not totally-massacred or expelled.The devastated land was re-populated by discharged Roman legionaires (of various nationalities),Greeks,as well as Arameans from Syria,Nabatean Arabs from Jordan,and Egyptians (then considered non-Arabs).This mixed population converted to Christianity in the 4th century and (mostly) to Islam in the 7th-following Omar\u2019s conquest.Now some Jews did survive Bar Kochba\u2019s defeat in 135 and no doubt some of these survivors converted either to Christianity or later to Islam (Sunni version).To get back to the main story,the mixed population (including presumably some former Jews) having converted to Islam intermarried with the descendants of Omar\u2019s desert Arab soldiers and administrators and adopted the language and culture of the desert Arabs.Later conquerers like the Fatinds, Seljuks,Crusaders,Tartars,and Ottomans didn\u2019t contribute much to the gene pool-though some later Arab immigration from Egypt,Morocco,and even Sudan did..In my view,this is the ethnic background of the present day Palestinian Arabs.So\u2026to answer your question there is some Jewish ancestry amongst the Palestinian Arabs but it probably represents a minority.(Some of them,however, do have traditional Jewish names like Suleiman- Solmon,Daoud-David,Musa-Moses,Ibrahim-Abraham indicating possible Jewish ancestry) ",

            "answer_text": "Question detail: \u201cIf you could go back 2100+ years, what would be the religion of the ancestor\u2019s (assume majority) of the modern day Palestinians?\u201d If you could go back 2100+ yrs, IMO some/many of the distant ancestors of the people who are nowadays called Palestinians, would have perhaps been in the Arabian peninsula. Their religion(s) therefore would have likely been whatever types of Arabian paganism were popularly practiced there at the time. Which seem to have consisted, at least by the era just before Muhammad \u2014which was more recently than 2100+ yrs ago\u2014 mostly of the worship of specific tribal deities or totems. Popular pre-Muslim Arabian deities by Muhammad\u2019s time were such as Hubaal \u2014 the primary god present at the Ka\u2019aba at the time of Muhammad\u2019s birth, and I believe the god of Muhammad\u2019s tribe. As well as worship of the feminine Arabian deities (or \u2018consorts\u2019 or daughters of deities), such as Al-Lat, Al\u2019Uzza, Manat. If you went back all the way to over 2k yrs ago in the Arabian peninsula, there were probably differences that far back; as opposed to \u201conly\u201d 1400-and-some yrs ago. But we know a bit about the pre-Islamic Arabian religion at the time of Muhammad; whereas we know less about it in times long before him. Those of their ancestors who were not Arabs, who can say for sure what all they were? I myself do not think that the \u2018majority\u2019 of them were ancient Jews. Are there some Arabs in places like Gaza or the West Bank today who might be able (if such a thing were even truly possible) to trace unbroken lineages that have never moved from that particular region, or very nearby, for over 2k yrs? I don\u2019t know; perhaps there are a few. But I think that\u2019s doubtful. Most peoples\u2019 family trees, so to speak, when you get into tracing ancestry that goes back even \u201conly\u201d 500 yrs, \u2018diverges\u2019 a bit from what they would generally consider themselves or self-identify as today. In some cases, peoples\u2019 distant ancestries could be scattered all around a region or even a whole continent, or sometimes even further afield. That area, the Levant, was a crossroads for centuries and much longer. Modern Palestinians could therefore, if they indeed have some lineages on the very same land that could go that far back, have anything ranging from ancient Israeli, Canaanite, Aramaean, Samaritan. Some tribes or nations that are no longer really in existence today or have long since been absorbed (Edomites, Amorites, etc). Also Greeks or Eastern Roman-affiliated peoples (Byzantine Christians), Italians (Romans), French or \u2018Franks\u2019 or other Europeans (Crusaders), Kurds (the Ayyubids were Kurdish), Persians, Turks (Ottomans), even Mongols, and others as well. In my view it\u2019s impossible to say that the modern-day Palestinian Arabs\u2019 ancestors were actually simply the Jews who lived in the very same place, and nothing besides. Many of the area\u2019s Jews, bear in mind, actually were either expelled or dispersed one way or the other (leaving the near East for destinations such as Italy, for instance, in particular; their descendants would eventually become Ashkenazi). That large-scale exile or exodus of Jews from the region, while it was never \u2018complete\u2019 (there were always some Jews there, and in neighboring areas), would have happened by about the 2nd or 3rd century or so. Furthermore, we can\u2019t overlook the one major more \u2018recent\u2019 defining event of the whole Middle East, which occurred within the past 1500 yrs \u2014 the expansion and spread of Islam and Arabs/Arabic language, culture, etc, out of the Arabian peninsula. The Arabs took and mostly \u201cArabized\u201d, and heavily Islamized, the region and neighboring regions in the 7th century. Thus that large gold dome that you see there nowadays, right around where the Temple once had been, which has been there now for the past 1300-and-some-odd years. I would bet that actually many of the Arabs of the region (whether you\u2019re talking about just the Palestinian areas, or also Jordanians, etc) actually descend at least partly from Arab invaders and/or settlers, colonizers, etc, who arrived within the Islamic era. But they\u2019re not exclusively made up of that \u2018stock\u2019 either; they\u2019re blended populations for sure. I would add that all the way up until perhaps the early 20th century, people living between the Jordan River and the Sea generally self-identified more so by their religion (and language, along with tribe) as opposed to specific ethno-national groups as we think of them today. Thus Arabic-speaking Muslims living in what would now be considered Palestinian territory, 100 yrs ago, probably self-identified more so with other Arabic-speaking Muslims, period \u2014 regardless of where in the Middle East they were from. Rather than identifying with Jews or even with Arabic-speaking (or other) nearby Christians. ",

            "answer_text": "They probably have a small amount of ancestry from the ancient Hebrews. There were Jews who converted to Christianity and then later converted to Islam. There are some Palestinian families who have a tradition of having originally been Jewish or Samaritan - and thus by extension Hebrew. I think this is a minority though. Some scholars believe that the core of their ancestry is from Arabized Canaanites, and other local (but non-Hebrew) groups such as Moabites, Ammonites, and Jebusites. This would explain why Palestinians are so genetically close to Jews on the Y-Chromosome. According to this position, the Arab tribes that settled in Palestine in the 600s AD were genetically absorbed into this Canaanite mix although the Arabic language and culture was adopted by the region. So to harmonize all of this, we could argue that Palestinians are descended from a core stock of various Canaanite peoples that absorbed both desert Arabians and Hebrews. In any case, we can\u2019t really know the exact truth for sure. ",

But almost all of the people who - since around 1960 began identifying as Palestinian Arabs - long ago adopted the language, culture and faith of the Arab conquerors who colonized the Levant in the 7th Century. Thus, while some Palestinian Arabs today certainly have a genetic connection to the Jews who were in the Levant at the time of the Muslim Conquest in the 7th Century, they are the descendants of those who wholly gave up on their cultural, religious, linguistic, or ethnic connection to those Jewish ancestors.

Natives are reclaiming their homeland from Muslim invaders, as Spaniards and Greeks and many others did before. An analogy to Jewish culture in Israel is the frequently invaded and colonized Hungarian culture. It is still the native culture of Hungary because it was never extinguished. Tribal American culture is still the native culture of North and South America for the same reason. ",

Since Ancient Hebrews lived in that land, they must be among the various ancestors of the present Palestinian Arab people. There is no logical reason why Ancient Hebrews would be the sole group of inhabitants of this land who cannot have been part of the ancestry of the present-day Palestinians. The claim made by Jewish chauvinists that the Palestinian Arabs cannot be at least in part descended from Ancient Hebrews is unreasonable, given the known history of this land, and is based purely on a malignant desire to deny the indigeneity of the Palestinians.

Genetic studies have been done on this issue before. Most of the Levantine population share some common descent, regardless of modern religion or ethnicity. That\u2019s a fairly common pattern historically; people tend to overestimate how much historical population movements have affected populations genetically.

For instance, in Egypt, the native people are Copts, the descendants of ancient Egyptians, a Christian minority that has been oppressed by Muslim Arabs. Arabs are genetically close to the Jews, the actual descendants of ancient Hebrews, but Arabs are not themselves the Hebrews\u2019 descendants. Note that the word Hebrews is capitalized in English.
