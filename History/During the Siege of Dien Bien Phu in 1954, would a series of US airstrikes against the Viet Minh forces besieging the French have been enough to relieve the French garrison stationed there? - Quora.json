            "answer_text": "No. The result will be the same. 1.The French did not lack planes. 2. The battle was far from home.The distance from Hanoi to Dien Bien Phu is 300 km, from Cat Bi is 400 km, from Vientiane and Xieng Khoang is 210 km, while the Bearcat aircraft has an operating radius without auxiliary oil box of just 250 km. 3. VietMinh kept secret about their anti-aircraft fire. When France knew it in battle and when they lost control of the sky, the Muong Thanh air base had been damaged and no aircraft could land on it. 4. Air strikes are only useful if you know exactly where the enemy is.But the scout ability from the air is restricted due to bad weather and air defense guns. You never see the enemy in daylight, they attack during the night. General Navarre said that from November 1953 to May 1954, the air force gave the number one priority to Dien Bien Phu. In the first phase, there were 75 C47 Dakotas to January 1, 1954 was increased to 100, about 16 C119 Packetts, 48 B26s, 8 Privateers and 112 Hellcat, Bearcat and Corsair. Numbers increased with the rhythm of the battle and peaked at 227. Major General Dechaux - Commander of the Air Force of the North uses between 65 and 75 attack aircraft per day. The number of combat aircraft increased from 128 (Nov 1953) to 154 (April 1954), 2/3 of which were in the North to help. The Air Force was surprised by Viet Minh's strong anti-aircraft fire and lost control of the sky. Navarre considered this to be the most serious incident. French intelligence informed him that the Viet Minh had 100 guns of 12.7 mm, 16 guns of 37 mm and an increase of 62 more 37 mm guns. A new problem arose with the French Army not able to parachute from high altitude and escort airplanes.  It is difficult to fly in high and rugged terrain like Dien Bien Phu. Many flights were delayed, canceled or had to turn around due to fog, thunderstorms and heavy rain. VietMinh also used camouflage to cover their artilery and air defense guns. It is difficult for a pilot to find a way to overcome the dense air defense barrier while bombing, dropping cargo and paratroopers when the battlefield is narrow, the two sides are too close to each other. The Viet Minh attacked at night, making the pilot confused when bombing. Lieutenant pilot Kloizt said many paratroopers fell into the Viet Minh area, hit by barbed wire fence and they were added to the list of the dead. During the Dien Bien Phu campaign, the French Air Force lost 60 aircraft (15 were destroyed by commandos on the ground), in the sky France lost 28, the navy lost 8 and nearly 100 ordinary aircraft were damaged. Actually, U.S pilots tried to help the French and they also had their first casualties in Dien Bien Phu. On May 6, 1954, when one U.S C-119 plane tried to find the position to drop the supplies for French, it was shot down by VietMinh.

            "answer_text": "Probably not. It may have slowed the attacks, but in all likelihood would not have been enough. The Viet Minh were not going away. They had dug tunnels to shield their artillery and likely would have been able to withstand the air strikes. The US was not likely to move additional forces to the region, and the air that was available there was probably not enough to neutralize the artillery. Some of it was 105mm howitzers, but other was mortars, which are pretty mobile and could deliver fire rapidly and then move to shelter. Also, the Viet Minh were not simply going to hunker down. They had AA weapons and could have added more. US air casualties would have made it difficult for the administration to continue air attacks. ",
