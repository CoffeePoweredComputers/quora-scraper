            "answer_text": "On average, prisoners at Auschwitz-Birkenau would get 7 1/2 hours of sleep in the summer and 9 hours of sleep in the winter. At the Buna/Monowitz part of Auschwitz-Birkenau, prisoners were typically woken at 5:00 A.M. during the summer and 6:00 A.M. during the winter, but sometimes as early as 4:30 A.M. Prisoners had to report for roll call at 5:30 A.M. in the summer and 6:30 A.M. during the winter. Roll call normally took half an hour. At this point, the prisoners were taken to the work areas. At 12:00 the Nazis allowed an hour lunch break, followed by a return to work until 6:00 P.M. in the summer, and 5:00 P.M. or the beginning of darkness in the winter. Prisoners were returned to camp and roll call was taken again. At 9:00 P.M. during the winter and 9:30 P.M. during the summer, a gong announced bedtime and the lights were turned off. The prisoners at Auschwitz-Birkenau were actually allowed enough sleep for the average adult. The average adult requires 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. ",
