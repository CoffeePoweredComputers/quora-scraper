            "answer_text": "The responses regarding the island-nation status and the resulting focus on a strong navy are \u201cright on the money\u201d.  As an island, Britain was not directly involved in warfare with nations who shared borders, and once the divisions between England, Ireland, Scotland & Wales were ended, there was a relatively secure border.  That would be compared to the European nations, where borders were constantly under attack.  So Britain could focus on naval actions rather than land-based defensive structures. However that is only a part of the story.  Britain gained success due to its unique culture.  It supports eccentricity and rebelliousness.  Kings had heads chopped off, and there was a constant desire to maintain individual rights, rather than submitting to the ruling power of the day.  Many of the sophisticated European courtiers saw this as savage and chaotic, but it had an impact on Britain\u2019s ability to find profitable solutions around the world. Add to this the British concept of primogeniture, where the first born son inherits the entire estate,  and the second and third sons need to build their own futures.  They had good educations and upbringings, but the \u201csecond sons of second sons\u201d had a drive to get on a par with their older brothers. So Britain had sea-faring as part of its culture, and Brits could become explorers, traders, privateeers, pirates, and possibly lords.  There was no fixed model, so they had to figure out creative solutions.  Look at Captain Drake and Captain Morgan as examples. As a comparator with the French culture, look at the formation of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company in the 17th century.  The idea came from two French fur-traders in Canada, Radisson and Groseilliers.  They had discovered the opportunity to trade through Hudson\u2019s Bay rather than overland, but the French governor of Canada slapped them with huge fines and confiscated their furs because they had failed to comply with the appropriate regulations.  So out of frustration, they went to Britain and sold their idea to the Brits, who formed the HBC - one of the oldest trading companies still in existence today. The concept in developing and empire was to use brainpower to figure out ways to make a profit.  As rule-breakers, the British were more able to excel at this than the more rule-driven competitors.  Some people might question whether this was ethical, but in the end most of the British Empire was based on profit-making activities, rather than military conquests.  Some of the trickery was resented.  There was a joke: \u201cQ: Why does the sun never set on the British Empire? A: Because even God does not trust Englishmen in the dark .\u201d Conclusion - as well as geography, there was a cultural factor at play. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with all the preceding answers. But the question does not define the time period. At one point the first European empire was that of the Spanish, which in many ways formed a benchmark of what defined a European empire between the 16th and 18th centuries. My special interest is the opening up of the Pacific Ocean in the 1790s to 1820s. What is clear to me is that Britain was artful in harnessing the vagaries of war to expand and extend her empire. During times of peace, as a trading nation she consolidated those gains. Consider the following topics on how empires have grown and faded. Sovereignty in the Pacific \u2013 Spain under international convention laid claim to the Pacific through discovery (Nunez Balboa 1513 and Magellan 1521). European nations such as the Netherlands, France and Britain had to grudgingly respect this difficult assertion. However, in 1789 Britain had the opportunity to challenge Spain during the Nootka Confrontation \u2013 near Vancouver Island. Spain conceded to Britain, lest there be a war, and so Britain gained peaceable access to the Pacific and Spanish colonial ports. This provided a quick solution for British whalers to visit the Spanish ports in the Pacific, and rapidly developed as a smuggling opportunity: British wares for valuable Spanish silver. Strategic Nodes for imperial expansion \u2013 Trade with China was the main game for the 17-19th centuries. As a general rule the Chinese Emperor had little interest in trade other than procuring silver, sandalwood and some other commodities. Whereas Europe was infatuated with Chinese silks, porcelain, tea, herbs, and luxury items such as jewellery and lacquered boxes. Chartered Companies were set up by various European kingdoms: Britain (EICo), Sweden, Dutch (VOC), French and so on. Britain\u2019s core access to China was via her trading ports in India and Ceylon. What was lacking was a strategic node \u2013 this came with seizing Cape Town from the Dutch in 1797. Sure, during the peace negotiations it was passed back, but in the next round of wars, the Napoleonic Wars, Britain seized Cape Town, and chose to not give it up at later peace negotiations. Similarly, Britain chose wisely in settling colonies at Sydney in 1788, the Falkland Islands, Penang and Singapore (Straits Settlement). Learning from your failures \u2013 Many years ago a British historian Vincent Harlow asserted that Britain\u2019s loss of her American colonies caused a great deal of reflection on what was required to have an effective process of colonising. His two volumes were entitled \u201cThe Making of the Second British Empire\u201d. Harlow described how the American Revolutionary War (1776-83) left a lasting impression with the British \u2013 and future colonies such as New South Wales (Australia), British North America (Canada), and New Zealand all benefitted from this professionalising of colonial administration. Political Systems \u2013 Monarchies Absolute and Constitutional - I\u2019d suggest that when you are strategically growing your empire, you play to your strengths. Spain had an absolute monarchy, and little opportunity for any form of \u2018consensus governance\u2019. Her empire had become large and unwieldy in terms of controlling her territories in the Americas and Philippines. With an absolute monarchy the vast wealth derived from the Americas was often squandered on \u2018adventures\u2019. By contrast I\u2019d suggest that the British system of governance, thanks to the English Civil War of 17th century, had a monarch who needed the houses of parliament to support the raising of taxes. So the British focus was more trade focussed, and starting from a lower base. As others noted \u2013 as a maritime nation Britain depended on shipping. And depended on going to war where her existence was at stake, or her trade threatened. Entrepreneurial Trade - For the Pacific Ocean \u2013 originally known as the South Seas \u2013 what fascinates me is how interest groups such as whaling merchants, were able to convince the British Ministry that long established monopolies should be reformed. The British East India Company was founded by Queen Elizabeth I in 1601. It controlled the access to all of the Indian and Pacific Oceans for all British subjects. That\u2019s a large monopoly! But whaling merchants convinced the Board of Trade that if sperm whale oil was to continue to illuminate middle class homes, then the whales in the Pacific needed to be hunted. So in 1786 the British government legislated that whalers and sealers had rights to fish \u2013 provided that they entered the Pacific via Cape Horn. That is, they would take the shorter route, but more challenging due to weather and currents \u2013 sailing against the wind into the Pacific. Within two decades the whole of the Pacific had been \u2018opened up\u2019 \u2013and the strategic value of Sydney as a port was also confirmed. Conclusion - My belief is that Britain believed itself capable of being a \u2018great nation\u2019 by dint of applying her commercial skills and enterprise in a maritime setting. She was able to achieve this since she seemed more adept at harnessing innovation, and not squandering opportunities as they arose. It is a lesson for all of us \u2013 the world does not stand still, and one must choose when to grab at the opportunities. To a large extent the lessons from Britain have been applied ever since, with the current world leader USA feeling a little challenged by the re-emergence of China as a new world power. ",
