            "answer_text": "Yes, but only for longer. Britain was bankrupted by cost of WW2 and really could not afford to keep a loss making empire. The costs were considerably increased by the Cold War that gave financial and military support to independence movements in the Duropean colonies. Many of these soon to be states had not developed to the point where prosperity was wide enough and the population educated enough to become stable democracies. Hence even government leaders that started out with democratic intentions became one party states run by kleptocracies ( the rule of theives). Colonies were quite often left in an undeveloped state because the colonising country wanted a guaranteed outlet for manufactures. To be a stable democracy the colony needed industries and employment and an educated class that understood economics. Too often industrial development was weak and the small educated class consisted of people who had absorbed left wing ideas at universities in the colonising country from academics who had no idea how to run a business or a state enterprise. Socialism may start with good intentions but soon becomes authoritarian when it runs into practical problems. In Africa particularly , but not exclusively there is the problem of tribalism, in some countries religious or racial division. When post independence governments were formed they were easily corrupted and were often replaced by a coup or a military takeover. The new government only had the legitimacy of force and was often based on the largest tribe or the army, it had no interest in being voted upon , no understanding of running a state or an economy. Ideally the British and other colonial countries would have taken three generations to hand over power with a major drive to educate populations, to build the economies and to let new governments run under supervision. I would estimate that this would take 85 years or three generations. Sadly there was neither the money nor the will in Britain to do this and no interest from those who thought they would be the elite of the new countries that were formed. One of the great criminals in all of this is Lenin. In Russia it was thought by many that a Marxist Revolution was impossible because Russia in 1917 did not have an educated urban proletariat that could take charge of a state . Lenin came JP up with the idea of a Vanguard Party that would run the state on behalf of the proletariat until that class emerged. In fact it was a recipe for state seizure by a group of highly motivated individuals who then murdered and oppressed on a grand scale to keep power for the party. This was justified as ultimately being on behalf of the proletariat, really rather like the Nazis who did the same on behalf of the Volk. Lenin\u2019s concept gave carte blanche to the revolutionaries in the former colonies to seize power in the name of the people because it stated that you could take power in any undeveloped country and use that power to bring on a fairer, juster, better world and that any crimes committed in the name of the people would be justified. It signed off to the incoming elite that you did not need to understand how an economy worked to run a state. Hence you had situations like the ruin of Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Ghana and so on. These places were better run and gave their people better lives when they were colonies and ideally would have been given independence over a long transition period. ",

            "answer_text": "No, we couldn't have, we were broke after the Second World War and couldn't afford to keep colonies that lost us money or that would try to fight an independence war. We had to get rid of India because otherwise we would have an independence war on our hands two years after we barely won a World War.  Theoretically we could have kept Malta, but Anthony Eden was too concerned about adding two more Labour MP's to Parliament to annex them. All other colonies either wanted independence (India), cost us money (Fiji) or other countries wanted them (Hong Kong). So because of our economic state after WW2 we could no longer keep our colonies together, we had to focus on rebuilding our nation and let the colonies develop their own. So no, we shouldn't, if we had, we may not have had the NHS and the Welfare State until later which would have been a disaster for Britain. ",
