            "answer_text": "If you want to know about those super rich, it's really no difference in most country - plus most super rich people have multiple homes in all world's top cities (New York, London, Shanghai, Singapore... what's over), for the super rich, nationality never matters - they are usually citizen of multiple countries depending on various tax policy. If you are asking about the generally believed richer group, I do believe in every country it's different, and in China, if you either: - Have 3+ homes in tie-1 cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen)- or run a small business that brings in a turnover of over 1 million RMB  (~200K USD) per year- or earns a salary of over 1 million RMB per year.You are considered rich. And your life: Live in top 10% neighborhood in the city.Kids go to top 10% middle school (college education cannot be bought with money so far)Travel 3+ times per year, and knows some weird geography term not many knows.Tend to spoil your kids with money, unlike western rich parents, Chinese parents enjoys making their kids feel superior with their money.And still work hard like a dog.Your neighbourhood:  Inside your home:   Your kid study here:  You spend lots of time buying here:  You obtained the license to do this:  You made people here complaining home price:  Everything else would be not much different, you just travel more, and has the luxury of going to expensive destinations like the South pole,  ",

            "answer_text": "Once we had a talk about this topic with friends, most of who MBA aluminums. One lady said she used to think if she had 10M RMB cash + 2 set of apartments in the core area of Shanghai, she would be satisfied and felt safe enough to no more working like a dog. And 2 years later she actually made it, after she and her husband, both previous McKinsey EMs, managed to transfer to the customer side. At that time base on my estimation they had a annual pre tax income at least 3M-4M RMB And as Shanghai natives they had 3+ apartments which at least worth more than 20M RMB. I pointed out my estimation to her and asked her why she was still work so hard?  And she just smiled atme and said:\" but that is just the money we need 2 years ago with one kid, since we are going to have 2 kids, they are not enough any more\" The point is they still led a life as same as before and as same as most of the other shanghainess, the only differences is just their apartment a little bigger and better located and more oversea vacations. Not for one day they could convice themselves that they are safe enough to stop working so hard.. That's how an upper-middle class in a fast-growing economics feel and think...  ",

            "answer_text": "I believe most wealthy people have mixed feelings. On the one hand it gives you a lot of opportunities for both yourself and your family. You can afford to send your kid to a good school and possibly a top university abroad. You can afford traveling and buying whatever you need.  On the other hand, wealth in China usually also brings along anxiety. This is partly measured in the  China Private Wealth Report which basically shows that 56% of Chinese people with personal assets exceeding 10 million RMB are considering emigrating. For most people it's because they perceive other countries to be safer in terms of environment and better in terms of education, but many wealthy people are also establishing homes overseas as a \"getaway plan\" in case the source of their wealth was exposed.  Another survey found that 78% of Chinese entrepreneurs experience high or moderate anxiety while less than 2% experience no anxiety. This anxiety usually stems from a lack of trust in the law and a related feeling that accumulated wealth is never safe. ",

            "answer_text": "Remarkably similar to what it is like to be rich anywhere else. The wealthy in China have a disproportionately greater say in internal affairs, have more spending power, better political connections, more access to luxury goods a stronger media presence, can provide better opportunities like education and healthcare for their children and are more likely to hold political office (especially high level national offices). They're also more likely to face prison time or labor camp time than get executed if they step out of line. Believe it or not being part of the wealthy elite of any society is pretty much awesome, it doesn't really matter which society that is. Wealthy elite of Iran? Awesome. Wealthy elite of China? Awesome. The consistent factor here is wealthy elite, not the individual society itself. I think that's fairly well contained in the premise of 'wealthy elite'. ",
