            "answer_text": "All I can say is that they were pretty good at hand to hand combat. Patrick O'Neill just kinda assumed they weren\u2019t good hand to hand fighters because of the tactics the Mongols used. But they were extremely good at hand to hand combat. The Mongol troops practiced it as a sport. Whenever a Mongol soldier finds himself without anything useful to do, he\u2019d find someone to wrestle with. They were as good at grappling as they were with their bows and arrows. And they\u2019d do daily drills on mounted close quarter combat. The result of this training was shown at the Battle of Ain Jalut. It\u2019s a battle the Mongols lost. In this battle the Mongols were ambushed and surrounded. So the Mongols were forced to fight in a gruesome melee. But in this battle despite being outnumbered and surrounded the Mongols almost won the day. They almost completely destroyed the left wing of the Mamluks in a melee while surrounded. It is said that one of the famous Mamluk commanders had to take off his helmet to boost morale even though they were the ones who clearly had the tactical advantage. Even in modern day Mongolia you won\u2019t find a single nomadic kid who isn\u2019t good at grappling. Even children as young as 4 or 5 can be seen outside grappling using legitimate techniques. You\u2019d see things like this all the time :  Usually there would be far less audiences. And the funny thing is there is no weight division in Mongolian wrestling. The concept does not exist. So they just wrestle whoever they want to wrestle with. Grappling increases your stamina a lot as well. Meaning in a prolonged melee the Mongols would get tired much slower than their opponents. So on average I\u2019d say the Mongol army was probably better at fighting in Melee than any other army of the time. Considering 100% of it\u2019s soldiers knew how to grapple and had better stamina.

            "answer_text": "Definitely not. They were primarily horse archers, though this wasn\u2019t exactly unique to them. They used swords and lances in combat as well, though as far as I know they were not particularly renown for either weapon. And this makes sense. Their main tactics tended to involve maneuver, flanking, ranged attack, and drawing the enemy out with feigned retreats. They use hand-to-hand combat mostly for delivering the finishing blow, unless forced or pinned down. I\u2019m sure they were perfectly competent at hand-to-hand combat, but your standard Mongol soldier spent a lot more time working on his archery and horsemanship, so I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019d think they would excel at it.  The Battle of Mohi is a good example of this dynamic. Hungarian knights, along with a contingent of Knights Templar, beat the Mongol vanguard pretty handily in hand-to-hand fighting at the Saj\u00f3 bridge. This didn\u2019t prevent Subatai from crushing the Hungarian army the next day, though the Mongols still took heavy losses in hand-to-hand fighting against the Hungarians, with Batu loosing 30 of his bodyguard, who presumably were among the better Mongolian fighters. The Mongols were not the greatest hand-to-hand fighters, but they didn\u2019t particularly want or need to be, so it didn\u2019t really hold them back. ",
