            "answer_text": "City is a permanent and well developed area having schools, colleges, hospitals, markets, industries etc. A city have it's own municipality and head of the municipality is called Mayer. City is basically an urban part of a district. There may be one or more cities in a district area. District is an administrative division of a country, having some urban and some rural area. District is ruled by government. In case of India districts are ruled by state government, because district somehow are within the boundaries of a state. Districts can be further divided into small administrative parts known as Tehsil/Taluka, and again a Tehsil may or may not be a City. Mostly, urban part of a district is always a city which is known with the same name as district-name, so a district always have atleast one city. Examples: Meerut District in Uttar Pradesh, India, have its urban area named as Meerut City. (Only one city in district).  Ghaziabad District in Uttar Pradesh, India, have Ghaziabad City and Modinagar City. (Two cities in district). Gautam Buddh Nagar District in Uttar Pradesh, India, have cities like Gautam Buddh Nagar , Noida and Greater Noida.(Three cities in district). New Delhi, in Delhi, India, is a district as well as is a city and is the Capital of India also. ",
