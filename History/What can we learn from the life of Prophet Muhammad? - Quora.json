            "answer_text": "I reccommend reading the Prophet\u2019s biography for an in depth understanding. A short summary is here: Remaining humble \u201cBlessed be he who humbles himself before Allah without having any deficiency, and who humiliates himself without poverty.\u201d Tanbih al-Khawatir: Vol. 2, pg. 66 The Holy Prophet was the pinnacle of humbleness and humility, and the number of stories about his conduct with not only his family and companions but his enemies as well remains an important lesson to us all. Teaching us the beauty of humbleness and the importance of humility, the Prophet Mohammad\u2019s lessons on humbleness help guide us back to the true essence of Islam. Giving charity \u201cGive charity without delay, for it stands in the way of calamity.\u201d Al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 589 The giving of charity, whether it be through the giving of food and material goods or through by being kind to others, is one of the most important lessons from the Holy Prophet. The act of selflessness, and the act of giving to others in whatever capacity available to you, is a key aspect of being a practicing Muslim, something we can all learn from the personal actions of the Holy Prophet himself. Being kind to your neighbors \u201cAnyone who believes in God and the day of judgment should not harm his neighbor. Anyone who believes in God and the day of judgment should entertain his guest generously and should say what is good, or keep quiet.\u201d Sahih Bukhari: Vol. 8, book 73, no. 47 The Holy Prophet taught us that by being kind to your neighbors you are also helping build a better Islamic community as well, and that kindness to those around you, whether they be neighbors or strangers, will help build a better relationship between you and Allah. The importance of being just \u201cThere is a Sadaqa to be given for every joint of the human body, and for every day on which the sun rises there is a reward of a Sadaqa (charitable gift) for the one who establishes justice among people.\u201d Sahih Bukhari: Vol. 3, Book 49, Hadith 870 Not only should we be kind and thoughtful to those around us, but we need to also be just and fair to everyone we come across in life. The Holy Prophet taught us that no matter who you come across, whether they be friend or foe, you must treat them as you would want them to treat you. This, according to the Prophet, is a powerful act of charity. Not having anger in your heart \u201cWhen one of you becomes angry while standing, he should sit down. If the anger leaves him, well and good; otherwise he should lie down.\u201d Sunan Abi Dawud: Book 42, Hadith 4765 The Holy Prophet remains the pinnacle of the best of human traits and qualities, and of those traits was his control over his temper. Removing anger from oneself is one of the most important aspects of being a practicing Muslim. By learning how to deal with any problem through Islamic values, one can help remove unhealthy anger and the consequences that stem from angry reactions. Remaining healthy both physically and mentally \u201cDon\u2019t indulge in over-eating because it would quench the light of faith within your hearts.\u201d Al-Mustadrak, volume 3, p81 If we indulge ourselves too much in the physical and mental distractions of this world, we create less time to connect to Allah. The Holy Prophet reminded his followers to cut back on over-eating and over-indulging oneself simply for pleasure and to instead focus on bettering our physical and mental health to help give our full potential to Allah. Learning to think carefully before you speak \u201cWhenever he wishes to speak, he contemplates: if what he wants to say is good, he says it and benefits as a result, and if it is bad, then he keeps quiet and remains safe as a result. When a temptation arises before him, he holds fast to Allah and guards his hand and his tongue: if he sees virtue in it, he seizes it, neither losing his modesty thereat nor displaying any greed.\u201d Tuhaf Al-Uqool: pg. 28 Following in the footsteps of the Holy Prophet, by learning how to think before speaking one can control their emotions better, and become more aware of how to properly react and deal with day to day situations. The Holy Prophet teaches us that while there is an importance to speaking out against injustices, in many cases there can also be a time for remaining silent in order to make a point. Actively learning and engaging with knowledge \u201cOne hour of contemplation is superior to an entire year\u2019s worship.\u201d Tadhkerah al-Haqaiq, Page 29 The Holy Prophet emphasized the importance of thinking and believing, and not only blinding following the mechanics or physical aspects of the religion. To simply think and believe is an act of worship, and through contemplation, we may bring ourselves closer to Allah as well Always speak the truth in your life no matter what\u2019s the situation is. Learn to be truthful, honest and sincere. Beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: \u201cThe best Jihad is when one speaks a true word in the presence of a cruel ruler.\u201dWe learn to be kind, gentle, patient and tolerant just like Prophet Muhammad (SAW). Spreading useful knowledge is the attribute communicated by the Prophet (SAW) on Muslims.Do good always even to those who offended you, give charity to the poor and help the needy without expecting any material reward in return just like our beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW).The Messenger of Allah (SAW) had an excellent, complete and sound intellect. No man has ever had an intellect as complete and perfect as His. So we should follow Him if we want to live a successful and perfect life.One should think beyond narrow borders. Holy Prophet (SAW) said: \u201cHe is not one of us who calls for Tribalism/Nationalism, or who fights for Tribalism, or who dies for Tribalism.\u201d So we should try to think beyond this no one is superior in terms of tribalism.One should be honest in trading or in business. Our beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was very honest in conducting trade and in His day to day affairs.Live simple life with little regard to worldly possessions. Our beloved Prophet (SAW) adopted a simple and modest lifestyle. So we should also try to live a simple life without being so much involved in worldly possessions.Always wish good for others just like Prophet Muhammad (SAW) did in His life. Muhammad (SAW) said: \u201cA believer wishes for others what he wishes for himself.\u201dDo not be unfair to others just like Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Messenger of Allah (SAW) warned those who do injustice to others in these words: \u201cBeware of injustice, for injustice will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.\u201dHoly Prophet (PBUH) was a man of high spirits and lofty character. One of His sayings is, \u201cEven a smile can be charity.\u201d Muhammad (SAW) was always respectful of the old, caring towards the weak and loving towards the children. We all should behave just like Prophet (PBUH) in our lives.Treat your neighbors with Kindness. Our beloved Prophet (SAW) said: \u201cTreat your neighbors in a kind and polite manner.\u201dDo not criticize others. Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: \u201cAlways remember your own faults before you mention the faults of others.\u201d",
