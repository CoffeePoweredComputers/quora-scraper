            "answer_text": "I think the best visualization of how the two have not fully reconciled is in election results, such as in the last federal election in 2013. This article shows the major regional differences in election results: Geographical Patterns in the German Federal Election of 2013 In particular this map shows the much stronger showing of the Left Party (Die Linke), the successor party to the former East German Communist party, the Social Unity Party or SED:   In Thuringia, the Left Party even succeeded for the first time in electing the state premier (roughly equivalent to a governor in the US system) in 2014, Bodo Ramelow, though he is actually a former Westerner. (It is worth noting, though, that even in the former east, the Left Party has never gotten more than a third of the votes in any elections I am aware of, and even the Left Party distances itself from its Communist past.) There are still serious differences in income levels as well, as this image shows:   There are also huge regional differences in average age, as the young are still moving away from the former East in droves:   This map shows the regional differences in religion \u2014 blue is non-religious, yellow is Roman Catholic, purple is Protestant:   Meanwhile the continued existence of the Solidarit\u00e4tszuschlag (a special tax instituted after unification to pay for redeveloping the former East) breeds a lot of resentment in the former West. Ostalgie (nostalgia for the former GDR) is also widespread in the former East, with a significant minority of people angry at how the German media tends to criticize the former GDR. A particular low point in the debate was when the SPD and Greens in Thuringia demanded that the Left Party agree to describe the GDR as an Unrechtsstaat (roughly translates as \u201can unjust or tyrannical state\u201d, a deliberate contrast to the term Rechtsstaat, \u201ca state of laws/justice\u201d, which gives Germans the warm fuzzies). This was a condition of them agreeing to let Ramelow become premier, but it caused a great deal of anguish and anger in the former East. It is also noticeable how the reactions to the Ukraine crisis were quite different in west and east. Easterners tended to be much more forgiving and understanding of Putin \u2014 there is even a sarcastic term Westerners use for such people, Putinversteher (\u201cpeople who understand Putin\u201d). Westerners tend to be much more Atlanticist and horrified at Russia\u2019s actions in the Ukraine. Thus while the country is nominally united, there are indeed still deep divisions between east and west \u2014 not insurmountable ones, but still quite visible even a quarter century later. ",

            "answer_text": "i guess it\u2019s impossible to reconcile 40 years of a history not shared. i\u2019m from the former GDR. i suppose it depends on which generation you talk to, my parents\u2019 generation are very much aware of the country that was lost, they didn\u2019t suffer directly under the dictatorship and we only recently had a conversation where i established that the GDR must ver ymuch have been considered a low-wage country. i didn\u2019t realise at the time a) because i was too small for that sort of thing to understand, b) because this didn\u2019t even exist as a concept for us. it\u2019s difficult to reconcile these things for me, even though i lived part of my life inside of them, if that makes sense. so, for my generation, i think less of someone from the west or the east, i think of people i\u2019ve met in places and whether i like them or not and, you know, i think of people in a personal way, i\u2019m interested in their political leanings and everythign else, but i don\u2019t tie them down to their origin. i expect them to do the same. i find origin is more or less an accident and i\u2019m privileged because of it in a way, compared to other countries, but it\u2019s not a right i have. what i\u2019ve noticed over the years, having lived in the UK as well, that east germans simply have less experience with acquiring wealth, with moving in stratas of society where this is a thing. people don\u2019t have a lot of money or experience with investing it, and i guess that is changing, but it\u2019s a major factor for me in terms of reconciliation. it\u2019s true that west germans have paid for a lot of repairs and modernisation, but it\u2019s also true that none of this has increased individual wealth or a sense of accomplishment in east germany. it\u2019s simply not particularly prosperous in the former GDR also because the country was gutted and colonised. i think the generation that grew up after the wall came down, they will think of a division even less, to them it\u2019s absolutely irrevocably history.

            "answer_text": "Well, the answer is a clear NO. And East and West aren\u2019t meant to be the same. Before I dive into your question really I just have to mention that Germany is VERY diverse and even West Germany is and we also have the north and the south. So, there are 16 states within Germany. All 16 states have different dialects ( only in the region of Hannover a very high German is spoken) and there are differences in food, slang and even in tradition and holiday days. Different religions too ( catholic/ evangelists) and different customs. That is one thing, so you can see already all states within Germany are already very different and they aren\u2019t meant to be the same. Now, let\u2019s focus on the differences between the former DDR and the former East (=former DDR) today. Has it developed well enough, so Life Quality is the same now as anywhere else? The answer is NO. Unfortunately not. The matter of fact is that Dresden and Leipzig for example and cities like G\u00f6rlitz are attracting many students from all over the world and offer just a beautiful student Life and amazing landscapes and architecture ( Dresden!!) BUT unemployment is still very high and after studying many decide to leave either to Switzerland or to the West or South to Germany ( Bavaria for example) . Still today, which I feel very confused about is, that women earn much less than men in the same Job Position in entire Germany ( probably in the entire world). AND a matter of fact is that the wages in the former East (former DDR) are still lower ( quiet low!) than in the West/ South/ North of Germany . Opportunities are less and the reason is that great people simply leave. No investments, no innovation, no YOUNG fresh innovative energy. By the way, my parents lived in the former East and I was born in the former east. It doesn\u2019t seem a surprise that I choose to study and then leave and live in Australia. I grew up experiencing the fall of the DDR and many, many years we didn\u2019t feel anything had changed. Life wasn\u2019t suddenly better. It was the same. Especially mentally people would live in the DDR for a while. Especially those who thought the DDR was a great place to be in . . . I am NOT commenting on that, as it\u2019s a different story and its emotionally very hard to talk about in general. Nobody would understand it anyway UNLESS you were living there\u2026no offence, but it is the truth. I am at the present moment in Germany visiting thinking about creating, building expanding my Life in the former East where my home ( Heimat!) is. But I clearly can feel that many people are still thinking the old way, and people who come to visit or study will eventually leave again because not everyone can earn the money they would like to or not everyone will find a Job and would want to stay (unless they fall in love with someone or they find a full filling Job, which is absolutely possible! I have friend being very happy in Dresden and Leipzig) By the way look at this amazing city Dresden\u2026a picture I took just this weekend walking along the river Elbe, breathing in the AMAZING architecture. A wonderful city! Actually I\u2019d love to live there.  An interesting thing about the picture is that you can see only elderly people sitting on the bench and that is no coincidence. Yes, of course, there are many young people too! But it is very apparent that there are more and more older people and less and less younger people. Not so apparent in the big cities, but once you leave the big cities it is definitely so. And then only the younger generations are growing up finally with a global , open mind. Open to travel and open to new experiences. Curious about everything and anything. I am lucky enough I left living 4 years in Spain and living 10 years in Australien and made Australien also my home. Because if I didn\u2019t I \u2019d still be as traditional thinking as my mum, who can\u2019t help but think very pessimistic and negative at times. She is extremely happy to be FREE but she can\u2019t understand that these days things are totally different and her way of thinking doesn\u2019t serve her , nor me , nor anyone. But that generation is still ( even though she is and always was AGAINST the DDR!) very shy, very critical, very careful, very anxious, extremely trusting ( news, newspaper\u2026), less trusting herself but the surrounding, sometimes complaining, often thinking about what others could think\u2026..THIS is a typical mind set of the former east and it\u2019s something I totally understand but I am glad I have left early enough to learn different. I must mention though racism in the former east is embarrassing and I have seen it here, how refugees are not welcome. Thank God, my mum and I we both help and assist everyone who comes here and I am teaching refugees German for free and my mum does anything she can to assist people around us having a better Life. But generally the mind set must come from the DDR. In the DDR people were brainwashed and controlled . We all know that. I am not going into further detail. But individual freedom didn\u2019t exist. Freedom of free opinion and individual unfolding of Life did NOT exist. So it\u2019s hard for those people to think freely and on their own if they never learned it. After the DDR people were suddenly unemployed or they were strong enough to see that freedom to start a new Life and drive forward to a more full filling Life. But a lot of people stayed complaining, wanting money from the state, Neo Nazis and Punks are still sitting on the streets with that exact mind set that the responsibility of the state is to take care of THEM, to give them money. So they also have that idea that any refugee who comes will take away money. Which is a total messed up mind set BUT it\u2019s almost as if they are stuck in a \u201cstate give me money\u201d mind set. They haven\u2019t learned that getting starts with giving. They haven\u2019t learned that multiculturalism is a chance and an opportunity rather than a disadvantage. They haven\u2019t learned that thriving , creating your own ideas, being creative, full filling your on needs and desires and fighting for them IS what creates money, happiness and new ideas for more to come in Life. They haven\u2019t experienced it..because they were first prisoners of the DDR, then prisoners of their parents mind and now prisoners of their own mind\u2026.and everyone who comes to the East is a thread because they fear they could take away. The mind set ( this negative energy is still very obvious). And please don\u2019t feel addressed if you live here and thriving. GOOD FOR YOU and I want to see more of them. I also want to see foreigners stay and build their businesses! I saw Chemnitz as a great example of failure. Nothing seems to work there toward a new Life FREE Life were money flows and businesses can flourish. Germans leave. Refugees stay. Empty houses. Parallel societies establish were integration doesn\u2019t work. Again there is a great Uni and people may be happy there but I am not seeing growth. It\u2019s the opposite. A lot has to do with the investors from the WEST who did NOT invest in the former East after the wall fell. Which would have been the only way to boost the economy and give it a great start. Instead NOTHING happened. People were lost and left alone. Yes they were free but lost! If they would have had trust and patience the new former east today would be very different. But after the wall fell NOTHING changed for many, many years. It seems I am painting a dark picture here. I am not. I love being here, it\u2019s beautiful. I love the spring and the summer and I am meeting wonderful young people to interact with. But I can\u2019t see a prosperous future here. Unfortunately. Still it\u2019s home and it always will be.

Whatever you know or feel may be different and is totally legitimate. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I believe the OP is asking the wrong question. It implies that there still are two distinct Germanies, yet this notion could not be further from the truth. In the 25 years since reunification, millions of Easterners have moved to the west, while millions of Westerners have relocated to the east. The two Germanies are no longer two individual homogeneous entities that need to be politically reconciled, therefore looking at pretty income graphs and such like does not answer the question correctly. One earns less in the east, that\u2019s correct, but the West Germans working in the east earn less, too. And one reason (of many) for this is the fact that the cost of living is also somewhat lower than in the West. Having said all this, there are cultural differences between those who were born and grew up in East Germany and those with a West German background, including myself, because when we were growing up, the two Germanies were indeed two distinct countries isolated by a wall as well as two completely different political systems with the impact that these systems had on the people, their behaviour patterns and thinking, and these differences sometimes show, regardless of where we live today, East or West Germany.
