            "answer_text": "When talking about the Great Purge alone then yes, around 1 000 000 ( more or less ) people died as a result of Stalin\u2019s paranoia. The thing about Solzhenitsyn\u2019s Gulag Archipelago is that while his experiences are genuine, he never had access to Soviet archives. His numbers are usually woefully exaggerated and should be taken with a grain of salt. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to \u201cprove\u2019 that someone died because of a specific event. For example, if someone dies because they were denied proper medical care or access to food, or committed suicide because they were afraid that they were going to be arrested, do you say that they died because of the purge, or because they died of other causes? The numbers differ depending on how you want to define \u201cdied under Purge\u201d. If you want to define it as people for who there are direct written evidence that they were executed, the number is going to be small. If you define it as people who should be alive but dead because of the purge, the number will be large. ",
