Revolution geniuses require to be on top of game, and ahead of the game.  Those are difficult to reach, requires an few miracles on top of walking way from all ruinage.  Many of the today's settings stigmatize the revolutionary genius potentials first and the most, then the other thinkers second. From the splenda content in coke bottle to the distracting neon light commercials on TV.  Any revolution genius becomes naturally deprived of development session an greek period counterpart would've received.  At same time, the revolution genius is an political figure.  This means tons of oppositions.   It's been noted by an German answer in 1923 in his book written in jail: that the revolutionary genius will be more difficult to appear as he grew up under commercialism than an simple life which allowed him to see the interrelations amongst system's function boxes and sectors.  Today the agrilcuture and industry sector becomes further away from residential, leaving an distortion imagery which naturally jams any new children's understanding of knowabouts.  Something the corporations may take want of for this dazed-undazeness may boost their fiscal chart by 25%. ",

            "answer_text": "\"...\"If only we had more people like him,\" and so on. Everybody just plays along with the farce, everybody plays along.\"-Noam Chomsky  The original context is along the lines of nobody gives heroes recognition or acknowledgment until they're either dead or after they've stopped doing what they do. Then, after the greatness or individuality has stopped, people decide to recognize the individual and perpetually fail to recognize the greatness of current leaders. Hence, \"if only we had more people like him.\" We do. People just don't like admitting other people are better than them, and it's hard to gain popularity. But once popularity is achieved there is a snowball effect because people like to feel like they're in the in-crowd. Everybody just plays along with the farce. Also, many great minds get discredited before they get a chance to shine. If a person is a plausible threat to a community or organization, that community or orginization will try to discredit them at all costs to preserve their own reputation. So, these genius revolutionists may very well be hiding somewhere in the woodworks, waiting for their opportunity to shine. ",
