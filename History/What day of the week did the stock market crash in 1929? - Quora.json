            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a chart of the crash, starting in September, and extending through part of November.  From Wiki: Selling intensified in mid-October. On October 24, \"Black Thursday\", the market lost 11 percent of its value at the opening bell on very heavy trading. [citation needed] The huge volume meant that the report of prices on the ticker tape in brokerage offices around the nation was hours late and so investors had no idea what most stocks were actually trading for. Several leading Wall Street bankers met to find a solution to the panic and chaos on the trading floor. [9] The meeting included Thomas W. Lamont, acting head of Morgan Bank; Albert Wiggin, head of the Chase National Bank; and Charles E. Mitchell, president of the National City Bank of New York. They chose Richard Whitney, vice president of the Exchange, to act on their behalf. With the bankers' financial resources behind him, Whitney placed a bid to purchase a large block of shares in U.S. Steel at a price well above the current market. As traders watched, Whitney then placed similar bids on other \"blue chip\" stocks. The tactic was similar to one that had ended the Panic of 1907, and succeeded in halting the slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered, closing with it down only 6.38 points for the day. The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 1930, six months after the crash of 1929 On October 28, \"Black Monday,\" [10] more investors facing margin calls decided to get out of the market, and the slide continued with a record loss in the Dow for the day of 38.33 points, or 12.82%. [citation needed] The next day, the panic selling reached its peak with some stocks having no buyers at any price. [11] The Dow lost an additional 30.57 points, or 11.73%, for a total drop of 23% in two days. [12] [13] [14] [15] On October 29, William C. Durant joined with members of the Rockefeller family and other financial giants to buy large quantities of stocks to demonstrate to the public their confidence in the market, but their efforts failed to stop the large decline in prices. The massive volume of stocks traded that day made the ticker continue to run until about 7:45 p.m. In reality, and in summation, the \u201ccrash\u201d was not a one-day event, although there were obviously days when prices plummeted. The markets did not hit bottom until mid-summer, 1932 when the Dow hit its low, down 89%. The market, the Dow-30 specifically, since there was not S&P-500 or NASDAQ at the time, didn\u2019t eclipse its September, 1929 highs again until 1954, 25 years later. AND, in 1937, the market suffered a further crash, losing 50% of its value. The chart above, btw, is from my subscription to TC2000, specifically an older, superseded version (v7) which is still available on its web site. I have stepped through the Dow-30 from mid-summer to 1932, one day at a time, and the one thing that has always struck me is how ordinary it all seems, just another \u201cfew days down followed by a few up days.\u201d You really don\u2019t get the sense that a \u201ccrash\u201d is occurring so much as a series of brief corrections that never stop for three years, nor any really signal that 1932 marked the bottom - until you look in retrospect.
