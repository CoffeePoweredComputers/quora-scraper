            "answer_text": "If you ask a Turk, they would say Ataturk, but most Turks don\u2019t know much about Nasser. Turkish people universally like Ataturk, but I cannot say the same for Egyptians. Turks see Ataturk as a war hero who weighed his actions carefully whereas Nasser used a lot of rhetoric and put himself into a political trap and ended up losing the Sinai, West Bank, and Gaza to the Israelis. Nasser was liked by many of the common people. However, the elites of Egypt did not like Nasser. You cannot say the same thing about the elites of Turkey. Whether it is the wealthy or the regular people, they all like Ataturk. Some extremely conservative people in Turkey maybe don\u2019t like Ataturk, but the elites and common people mostly do, and he improved the Turkish brand and Turkey\u2019s stand in the world. Of course, the elites connected to the Ottomans did not like Ataturk. Ataturk, unlike Nasser, was not from a simple background. Ataturk was very educated. He had lived in Europe and could read French classics and was exposed to German and French officers. Before Nasser, Egypt was very well admired in the Arab world. After Nasser, Egypt\u2019s brand starting going down. I think Nasser\u2019s seizure of the assets of the Egyptian elites and the Greeks and Italians and giving so many of those resources and assets to incompetent and undeserving people hurt the Egyptian brand. The Turkish brand improved under Ataturk, the Egyptian one temporarily did under Nasser, but then fell horribly. There were some good things about Nasser. He spoke for the common man in Egypt. Before that, the regular people weren\u2019t given enough of a voice in the country. He tried to promote education and even many Palestinians went to university for free in Egypt. He inspired many Arabs. ",
