There isn\u2019t comprehensive reliable record keeping on specific punishments, although some owners did keep records of their brutality. Since the purposes of the whipping included punishments, gratification of sadistic urges, intimidation, and other barbarous urges, the frequency was entirely at the whim of depraved people. ",

            "answer_text": "A sensible owner would reserve punishments for when a slave disobeyed. A full blown whipping would cause the slave to be unable to work for days. An overseer might hand out casual strokes anytime they thought someone was slacking but that could be counterproductive. No doubt there were sadisitic owners who took pleasure in inflicting punishments but for the most part they wanted the work doing. ",
