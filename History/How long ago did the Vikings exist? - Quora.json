            "answer_text": "The Viking Age is normally dated from the Norse raid on the Lindisfarne Abbey in Northumbria (an English kingdom) in 793 CE, to the failed Norwegian invasion of England in 1066 CE, when Norwegian King Harald Hardrada tried to win the English throne at the Battle of Stamford Bridge and died for his efforts. He is sometimes called the Last Viking. That was nineteen days before the Battle of Hastings, the date usually given for the Norman Conquest. Those dates precisely represent the period over which the Norsemen raided the shores of Europe and, in some cases, invaded and conquered the lands they raided. The Vikings were, strictly speaking, the raiders or pirates themselves rather than the whole Norse population. And Norsemen did raid Europe before 793 and after 1066. In particular, Viking raids predated Lindisfarne by at least a few years. And at least some Viking raids and invasions continued until the early twelfth century. King Magnus Barefoot of Norway, Harald\u2019s grandson, was an aggressive conqueror in the style of the old Viking kings, like his grandfather, and he was the last Norwegian king to die in battle abroad (in Ireland, in 1103). So, to answer your question, vikings (seafaring Norsemen who conducted pirate-style raids and may or may not have invaded foreign lands) existed between about twelve hundred and nine hundred years ago.

            "answer_text": "Between 600 and 700 they appeared as a loose rural society in the coastal areas of south-western Norway. They soon conquered south Norway and Denmark and made Denmark their power center for around 300 years until 1066, when the last Danish Viking king died at a battle in England (battle of Stanford bridge) Other Viking kingdoms existed for shorter times on Sicilia island and other parts especialy Normandy. From there also in 1066 the Norman king Wlliam invaded England, and the Normans ruled England for several centuries. In Norway the Viking dynasty lasted until 1371, when the last Viking king died, young and without male offspring of his family. Somehow the Vikings still continue to exist: In coastal areas of Norway around 60 percent of population are of Viking descend, and the population of Iceland is over 90 percent Viking origin. In all other places the relatively few Bikings have melted into the general majority populations and disappeared. ",
