            "answer_text": "Realistically nobody, since the vikings eventually became Christians, but if you were to trace back people of Scandinavian descent to a viking origin after the 8th Century AD it would probably be the United States. The vikings founded kingdoms throughout Scandinavia which became Christians and went through centuries of unions and divisions in which their people moved into other places and eventually moved into America during the XIX Century which became the largest colony in the world for most Western European nations except for Spain and Portugal in Latin America. Together with the British descendants, whose DNA was mixed with the Saxons since the 4th Century AD (and yes even Vikings at some point as well), people of Scandinavian descent make up a lage portion of the population of the USA. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that it was in the thirties percentagewise, only slightly below the one from mainland Britain. ",

            "answer_text": "england and some of north america. iceland too, and the islands off scotland. not all scandinavians were vikings but the ones that sought farmland were largely viking and those are mostly in england in lincolnshire, leicestershire and yorkshire with some in east anglia, lancashire and cumbria. it\u2019s funny because you\u2019d think norway, sweden and denmark would have the most. it\u2019s hard to argue the numbers. the source countries may still have more by numbers, but they also may not have as many actual vikings as england. while many viking descendants and viking traits are still in their genepools, many vikings left and went to england, then some went later to north america. a few to australia too. descendants of course, not actively viking for centuries in the strict sense of the term. it\u2019s also hard to distinguish between an anglo-saxon and a viking. it\u2019s more a distinction between time periods and boat-building styles than of blood. 400s to 600s, in keel boats, from denmark, north germany, frisia/friesland, sweden and norway, they\u2019re anglo-saxons. later waves 700s to say, 900s or a bit later, in longships, they\u2019re more from denmark and norway and considered vikings, though swedes were going east by river and were also vikings. everybody wants to claim viking ancestry but there is no single viking dna marker, not even the I1 native scandinavian haplogroup is proof of it. you have to know as much data and context as possible and the times of the immigration waves and use clusters of information to find best guesses.
