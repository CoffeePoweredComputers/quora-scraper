            "answer_text": "It was from the year 620-1258, and most Arabs weren't Nomads actually. Arab empire started from Hijazi region already established cities made of traders and civilized cities they weren't Nomads at all. They were victorious in battles and very strategic that's why they builded the biggest empire the world ever saw at that time, The Arabic empire was the first \u201ctruly universal civilization,\u201d which brought together for the first time \u201cpeoples as diverse as the Chinese, the Indians, the people of the Middle East and North Africa, black Africans, and white Europeans.\u201d During this period, artists, engineers, scholars, poets, philosophers, geographers and traders in the Islamic world contributed to agriculture, the arts, economics, industry, law, literature,navigation, philosophy, sciences, sociology, and technology, both by preserving earlier traditions and by adding inventions and innovations of their own. Also at that time the Muslim world became a major intellectual centre for science, philosophy, medicine and education. In Baghdad they established the \u201cHouse of Wisdom\u201c, where scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, sought to gather and translate the world\u2019s knowledge into Arabic in the Translation Movement. Many classic works of antiquity that would otherwise have been forgotten were translated into Arabic and later in turn translated into Turkish, Sindhi, Persian, Hebrew and Latin. The Arabic Empire significantly contributed to globalization during the Islamic Golden Age, when the knowledge, trade and economies from many previously isolated regions and civilizations began integrating through contacts with Muslim (and Jewish Radhanite) explorers and traders. Their trade networks extended from the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Indian Ocean and China Sea in the east. These trade networks helped establish the Islamic Empire as the world\u2019s leading extensive economic power throughout the 7th\u201313th centuries. Early forms of proto-capitalism and free markets were present in the empire time where an early market economy and early form of merchant capitalism was developed between the 8th\u201312th centuries, which some refer to as \u201cIslamic capitalism\u201d. A vigorous monetary economy was created on the basis of a widely circulated common currency (the dinar) and the integration of monetary areas that were previously independent. Business techniques and forms of business organisation employed during this time included early contracts, bills of exchange, long-distance international trade, early forms of partnership (mufawada) such as limited partnerships (mudaraba), and early forms of credit, debt, profit, loss, capital (al-mal), capital accumulation (nama al-mal), circulating capital, capital expenditure, revenue, cheques, promissory notes, trusts (waqf), savings accounts, transactional accounts, pawning, loaning, exchange rates, bankers, money changers, ledgers, deposits, assignments, the double-entry bookkeeping system, and lawsuits. Organizational enterprises independent from the state also existed in the medieval Islamic world. Many of these early proto-capitalist concepts were further advanced in medieval Europe from the 13th century onwards. A significant number of inventions were produced by medievalMuslim engineers and inventors, such as Abbas Ibn Firnas, the Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101, Taqi al-Din, and most notably al-Jazari. Some of the inventions journalist Paul Vallely has stated to have come from the Islamic Golden Age include the camera obscura, coffee, soap bar, tooth paste, shampoo, distilledalcohol, uric acid, nitric acid, alembic, valve, reciprocating suction piston pump, mechanized waterclocks, quilting, surgical catgut, vertical-axle windmill, inoculation, cryptanalysis,frequency analysis, three-course meal, stained glass and quartz glass, Persian carpet, and celestial globe. Trade between Arabs and the rest of the world changed significantly as new commercial practices developed in the empire. Arab merchants introduced many ideas that eased the trading process. For the first time letters of credit were used in lieu of cash to exchange goods and services. These non-cash transactions were a big step forward in the ancient world. The Arab Empire was a creative, unique, and puissant civilization which played a crucial role in the history of the world. Religion played the central role in the establishment, growth and spread of the empire. Geography also greatly influenced the destiny of the empire. The military success of the Arabs, supported by a strong political system, led to a very stable kingdom spanning three continents. The Arab Empire made long-lasting contributions in the fields of mathematics, science, and economics which are still in practice throughout the world today. The ability of the Arabs to effectively incorporate different arts, cultures and traditions of the far reaches of their empire strongly influenced their impact on other peoples and on all modern civilizations.

            "answer_text": "For one thing, it wasn\u2019t really a nomad or an Arab empire. While the Muslims responsible for the initial conquests were predominantly Arab nomads, they were never entirely Arabs even at the beginning, and they became less so thereafter. In many regions, there was an Arab-ish ruling class established over existing Byzantine and Persian bureaucracies, and in time hybrid societies were established, with the rise of semi-Arabized/semi-Persianized cultures. Elsewhere, the ranks of Muslim or at least Muslim-led armies were filled with non-Arabs. Spain was conquered by Berbers and sizable chunks of central Asia by Persians. For another, it didn\u2019t last that long. The caliphate started to crumble a little over a century after it started. For all practical purposes, Al-Andalus and northwestern Africa went independent in the second half of the 8th century, and other parts of the caliphate started to fall away through the 9th. The caliph in Baghdad received little more than lip service as the leader of the faithful for a century before early 10th century rise of the Fatimids. ",
