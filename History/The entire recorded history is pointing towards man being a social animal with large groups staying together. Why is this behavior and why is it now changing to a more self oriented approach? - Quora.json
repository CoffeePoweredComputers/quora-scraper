            "answer_text": "Human nature has remained more or less same through the generations. What has changed is self-expression and the ability to find like-minded people. And the epoch for this change - at least the kind of change you see now - coincides with the advent of the internet.  In my opinion (I don't have hard statistics to back this up, although it's a theory that seems to make sense in my head), the fraction of introverts (which is whom you're referring to as 'self-oriented', I presume) throughout history hasn't changed much. The reason for this perceived increase is because these introverts have started expressing themselves more. Historically speaking, introversion and being alone have always been frowned upon - probably a remnant of our Stone age instincts - and introverts, in general, avoid social situations more often than not, which created a vicious cycle where introverts either embraced their identity and remained ostracized or faked their way through social situations well enough so that people didn't notice. Talking about this and trying to change the mentality of others was a very risky endeavour before the Internet-age because that meant potential social isolation and being labelled a \"weirdo\". So they mostly stuck to reading books and making art and other pastimes that didn't garner much attention among people who didn't know them. But the Internet changed all of that.  Suddenly, people had a mask, and a massive network of diverse people around the world who expressed themselves more and more freely without risks of the potential repercussions that would have occurred in the real world (this also explains why the internet can be a very rude, and unforgiving place.) As Oscar Wilde said, \"Give a man a mask, and he will show you his real self\" - introverts started seeing how there were so many like-minded people around the world to whom they could speak their mind and have their thoughts echoed right back. This new, emboldened bunch of people now found themselves in a place that not only accepted what they were told was \"abnormal\", but also appreciated them and applauded them for it. They finally found a vent for their thoughts and ideas that they formerly had no one (or very few people) to express to and people from across the globe appreciating them for it. This increased exposure also helped society as a whole to be more tolerant and accepting of introverts as it finally got to hear their side of the story.  Meanwhile, extroverts have continued to do what they always do - hang out with other people and spend most of their time outdoors in social situations. So, in conclusion, the reason this 'self-oriented' culture seems to have increased is simply because the thoughts and ideas of more and more introverts are finally getting the limelight thanks to the internet, and society is becoming more accepting of people preferring to be alone. In other words, it's a classic case of Sampling bias that is slowly clearing up. ",

            "answer_text": "Some large carnivorous animals, such as tiger, leopard and bear (which is omnivorous) live alone. There are two basic conditions for animals to survive: there is enough food and they are not to be eaten by other animals. For larger animals, their body sizes lead to two inevitable consequences: they require more food, and they face less natural enemies. So, the primary problem for larger animals would be to find enough food. If these animals live together in a group, the problem of insufficient food would be exasperated. As for those smaller animals such as ants, wolves, monkeys and human beings that have to face many natural enemies need to get together, depend on and protect one another from their enemies. ",
