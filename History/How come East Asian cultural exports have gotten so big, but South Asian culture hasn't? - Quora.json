            "answer_text": "Haven\u2019t you heard about \u2018Bollywood\u2019 in India? The population of India would be over 1.4 billion people; it is one of the top domestic markets in terms of cultural commodities, including movie, TV, and so forth. India\u2019s cultural power and influence are huge enough to meet not only domestic needs but also around the world. The movie industry so-called \u2018Bollywood\u2019 would be an excellent example to prove it. Basically, East Asia 3 countries are the countries based on export using their active assembly-manufacturing systems, also have long relationships with the English oriented markets. So, it looks like these countries achieved significant exports, also seems to be cultural exports are overwhelming other Asian regions. South Asian culture and market also huge enough not to be underestimated. ",
