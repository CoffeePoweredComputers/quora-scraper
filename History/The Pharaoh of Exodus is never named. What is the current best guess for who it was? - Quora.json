            "answer_text": "My Father have made a work on it see it. Ramesses II is a possible candidate of the Pharaoh of Moses. There are some calculations to estimate the possibilities that he is the most powerful candidate for the identity of Pharaoh of Moses. According to Wikipaedia , Ramesses II was born in the year 1303 BCE [-1303] and died in 1213 BCE [-1213]. This means that he lived for 90 years. [-1213]-[-1303] = 90 Wikipedia also claims that he reigned from 1279 BCE [-1279] to 1213 BCE [-1213] . If this is true then he became a king at the age of [-1279]-[-1303] = 24 At this time he could have begotten some sons or daughters or both. The total period for his reign is [-1213]-[-1279] = 66 years. Seti I is said to live for 44 years. So Seti was born in the year [-1279]-[44]=1323 BCE [-1323] Age of Seti at the birth of Ramesses II [-1303]-[-1323]=20 years. It is said that he appointed Ramesses II as a regent prince when the age of the prince was 14 The age of Seti at the time Ramesses II was appointed as a prince was 34 , [20+14]=34 . Assuming two Pharaoh theory One may have trichotomy in regard to ages of Moses and Ramesses II. Either Moses is older than him or younger than him or equal to him in age. Assuming that age of Moses was less than age of Ramesses. Let it be supposes that if x is the age of Moses then the age difference is as follow:- 1<x<10. Bible says that when Moses came back to Egypt as a Prophet of G-d then the age of Moses was 80 years. So the age of Ramesses II would be 90. This is not a Probable age difference. Since this implies that all the events which occur were in the last year of the Pharaoh. So it is a safe estimate to assume the age difference between the two to be 5 years. So one can safely assume that the age of Pharaoh at the time of return of Moses would have been 85 . So Moses might have returned to Egypt in the year [-1213]-[5]= -1218 BCE. The objection is that Ramesses could not follow at an old age of ninety. The answer is that as he was a King and it was his duty to maintain balance in his kingdom , so it was his duty to follow them even at this age. Further he must have some comfortable carts which could transport him from once place to an other place . So it is not impossible for a person like him to move from one place to another place , when there was no fear of any counter attack from the Hebrews. Things may fit according to the Biblical narrations and the events of Ramesses II. As for Ahmose the stele of great storm cannot be a Biblical Punishment. Further the Hyksos were not Hebrews. Unless it is proved that Hyksos and Hebrews were synonym words , it is not going to make a powerful argument. The biblical story mentions a place named Ramesses .It was not the first city on the site. It was built on the remains of an earlier city probably back into the 12th dynasty, so it is possible that an earlier city is being referenced by the later name. If the writer knew of the name of Ramesses, then the author could not be before the person of this name. So there are only two possibilities. Either the author who knew the name was of the latter period or of the period of the reconstruction and renaming of the city.But not before the monarch who built it. So in this case 480 years are just a metaphor , not exact number. Last and not the least , any one of the Seti\u2019s daughter could have found Moses. NB Even if Ramesses is not the Pharaoh of Exodus , the number 480 is not in its literal meaning with mathematical certainty. Discussion on the number of Years 480 People have supposed that it is an accurate number of years as we are accustomed to see , in the present and previous centuries. It might not be the case in the distant past. But granted that it is a number of years then its unit are different . 480 years are not the years in the units of days where a year is of 365 days or 354 days in general. Let call such a unit of year in days as Year in Day units [YDU ] There is another way to view , that is years in the Unit of Generations and YDU. 480 =40*12 That is it is a year in the unit of a generation taken to be of 40 years. But the age of generation does differ. Taking it as 70 years for a generation one may use a formula as follow:- n years in Unit of 40 year Generation = [4/7]n in Unit of 70 year Generation. 480 years in Unit of 40 years per Generation =274.2857 Years in Unit of 70 years per Generation. Since there is no concept of Decimals in Ancient Hebrewa then we chop the decimal part instead of rounding it of. 480 years in the former units = 274 years in the latter units. But this is a unit in the product of Lunar Year of 354 days and Generation, where a Generation is supposed to be of 70 Lunar years of 354 days as an average year . These years are in Lunar Calender. Although there may be leap month , but in general calculation a year is considered of 12 months. There are 354 days in a normal lunar year. So converting 274 years of Generations of 70 years to Solar years is as follow: 274 *354/365 =265.742 Solar Years. 265 years [Chopping the Decimals instead of Rounding them off] Now Solomon ascended to throne in the year 961 BCE . So 961+ 265= 1226 This is very close to the death of Rameses II who died in the year 1213 BCE. Thirteen year before the death of Ramesses II. The remaining difference may be due to other errors if the Pharaoh died after a year or two after Exodus. Conclusion The number of years is not in the Solar Calendar. It is in Lunar Calendar ,neglecting the leap years of 13 months. But it is not in the pure form , it is in the form of Generations and the average age of generation taken as 40. The same years become 274 in the form of generations of 70 average Lunar years . It is not the actual generation but a calculation of years. It is impossible that same generations would have passed with two different average ages of a generation. Lastly a conversion is necessary in Solar Years of 365 days. Addition on 12\u201311\u20132019CE The above discussion was incomplete. So some more discussions are necessary. First Of All 480 is an Approximate Value. Second Of all it does not mean that exact 12 generations have passed. The actual generation may be either less than 12 or more than 12. The average year may also be an approximation. So an age of a generation may be may vary with in a range of number from 20 to 70 Hebraic Years. Third Of all the a Hebrew Year may be taken as of 12 months , neglecting the Thirteenth Leap Month in a cycle of 19 years. Forth Of all there are 354 days in a Hebrew Year. So if one may neglect a 355 year leap year or 360 days. Fifth Of all one may have an Ideal Calculation and an Actual Calculation. So one must recalculate keeping the above Axioms in mind. Suppose that there are \u1d23 Hebraic Years and Further suppose that \u1d51 actual generations ,in \u1d23 years. Let it be also supposed that the actual average age of a generation is \u1d69. One may Suppose that (\u1d51)(\u1d69)=\u1d23 But the same \u1d23 years may be represented by an other number say \u1d5e . So one may assume that \u1d5e =(12)(40) years. Where 12 is the generation and 40 is the ideal age of a generation. So the number (12)(40) is a number of an Ideal Year. But there are some more possibilities of an actual average of a generation from different perspectives. 20 ,25,70,100. One may not confuse life span and generation. The average generation may be taken as the average age of parents of a person at the time of birth of the person. But one may take 20 years , as the ideal time of the marriage of the parents of the person. So (20)(12) = 240 years. So Ideal number 480 is actually to the actual number . The writer did change the average age of a generation from birth to the time of the average time of marriage to the mean of the life span of the person. So 240 became 480. This is not a mistake , but it is a conversion , from one system to an other system. So the year become 240. It must also be noted that (240)(2) =480. As this is twice the actual number , it may also shew that a couple , a male and a female marriage. How ever it may not be the case. But it does mean that 480 Ideal years may be used for 240 actual years. If the 970 or 966 So one may come to the numbers 970+240 =1210 or 966+240=1206 In the second case if the year of the beginning of construction is neglected then it is 967+240= 1207 So it appears that the Pharaoh was Merneptah instead of Ramesses ii, if the calculation is accepted. Since he ruled from 1213 BCE to 1203 BCE . Now if the years are converted in to solar formation one may get 240 (354/365)=232.76 Chopping it is 232 232+970= 1202.76 or 1202 , a close approximation . 232 +967=1199 BC Similarly 232+966=1198 This will bring Exodus in the year of Seti ii So these possible conversions may be discarded. How ever this is based on the assumption that the actual years were changed by the ideal values and this was done on purpose, not to make confusion but a conversion was liked by the author/writer. Those who would have known that this is just a conversion, it would not have been a problem. It may be noted that a number of numbers are used in Hebraic Bible are symbolic and may be used to find the actual number. One may ask why the authors use such numbers? The answer is that this is not the only place in Hebrew Bible where such a practice is found. How ever it is one of the places where a symbolic number is used to find the approximate value close to the actual value. An approximate difference few years is always suggested. One must not expect and must not accept the Mathematical Exactness in numbers and must allow some Mathematical and Non Mathematical Approximation. Proximations and Approximations both are possible, and Exactness is discarded. Thanks For Asking If there is any new thing I shall add it in the answer. 14\u201311\u20132019 CE The meaning of the number 480 is that \u201c If the period between Exodus and The Beginning of Construction would have been an Ideal Period then it would have been 480\u201d. This means that the Ideal Period is neither equal to (480)(360) =72800 days nor equal to (481)(365)=175200 days. The number of days in each Ideal Year would be just a hypothetical value. If Twelve Generations each of 21 years are taken then (21)(12) =252 years. One may make a difference between a generation and a life span, where latter is just a subset of the former. 252 years may be of (252)(365)=9980 days or (252)(360)=92720 days. Going beyond the number of the writer who simply changed the actual year by an ideal year , one Ideal Year is implied to be consisted of the following days 480 Ideal Years = 92720 Actual Days 1 Ideal Year = 92720/480 =191.625 days. But this must not have been in the mind of the author, when he would have substituted the Actual Number of Years by Ideal Number of Years. This is only an implication of what the author did by Latter Mathematics. One may calculate for 360 years , and this is left to the readers to do so if the wish. This does shew that at times meanings Hebrew Bible are deeper that the literal meaning. ",

            "answer_text": "The story was built 700\u2013900 years after the \u201cfact\u201d, so it was mostly a story made up the need for that story to be part of their history. To begin with, the people living in Canaan to the end of the time it was called Canaan, were the same people who lived in it since paleolithic times. There was never an invasion by people who originated in Ur of the Chaldees, then lived in Egypt for 400 years, then invaded Canaan and killed all the Canaanites. But \u2026 If it had happened around the time the story claimed it did, the pharaoh might have been Rameses the Great. Except that his eldest son was killed as a child, but Rameses\u2019 eldest son went on to be a great general. It also could have been one of the Thutmosid pharaohs, (They were called Thutmose - but also Thutmoses), from where the name, in 900 (or more) year old memories, the name Moses came. (That \u2018Moses\u2019 means \u201cdrawn up from\u201d in Hebrew is totally irrelevant. First, an Egyptian princess wouldn\u2019t have given her son (foster or not) a Hebrew name. Second, Hebrew didn\u2019t exist as a language until the Israelite and Judean kingdoms, which came about centuries later. In Egyptian, mose or moses was a part of a name, preceded by the name of a god, because it meant \u201cis born\u201d. So Thutmose, or Thutmoses, meant Thoth is born. \u201cMoses\u201d would just have meant \u201cis born\u201d, and no one would name a child like that. So I\u2019m guessing that the pharaoh meant was either Rameses or one of the Thutmosid pharaohs. Meant, not was. Meant by the Jews who made up the story in the mid-6th century BCE. Then they invented a Hebrew word meaning \u201cis drawn up from\u201d, and that word was Moses. But, as others have said, current scholars don\u2019t believe it was anything more than pure fiction. (For instance, we\u2019ve found the ruins of the Canaanite dwellings from before Thutmose I to after Rameses the Great - and they were polytheists all that time. They were polytheists even at the time of the Captivity. (But, if El couldn\u2019t protect them from the Babylonians, maybe they should pray to YHWH, their war god. And from there, monotheism.) ",
