            "answer_text": "First things first. Bengalis do not have Durga temples because according to them, Durga is a warrior goddess who comes back to her parent\u2019s place (which is Earth) for 4 days, to relax and get pampered. Having a temple by her name defeats that very logic. She can\u2019t stay on Earth. She has to go back to her own place.Durga Puja is a recent historical phenomenon in Bengal[1] [2] [3] . Worshipping Durga in that mass frenzy manner, dates back to 1790, when 12 Brahmin friends in Guptipara, Hooghly, got together to organize and celebrate a \u201cbaro-yari\u201d (meaning 12 friends) or \u201csarbojonin\u201d (meaning, belonging to all or all-inclusive) Durga Pujo.[4] Prior to that, Durga Puja was organized and celebrated mostly by feudal houses or other rich, aristocratic families. Nowadays, put 4 bengalis together anywhere in the world, and they will organize a Durga Puja.There\u2019s Durga Puja happening right now in UAE (Dubai), all over the USA, all over the UK, in Poland, in Ireland, in Netherlands, in Italy, in Finland, in Norway, in Germany, in Singapore, and of course, in Bangladesh, and many other countries.   (Sadly, not in Israel) I\u2019ll look forward to the logic of why Bengalis would organize and spend endless amounts of cash, time, energy and emotion on a thing that they are not fond of.   Durga Puja held in Cologne, Germany.

They could come back at you with a potent weapon of choice: The Egg Roll. [5]  This question is based on the premise: Being fond of any God/Goddess, would be indicated by having their temples all over the area. That\u2019s not how religion rolls. First, religious thoughts and even religiosity differs based on caste, class and other demographic markers. Religion is not a homogeneously practiced entity, especially when it comes to Hinduism. Different communities and different castes have their own loved and revered deities. Establishing temples by those specifically loved or revered deities, is dependent on the muscle and economic power of those particular communities, rather than being dependent on the fondness factor . Power of the ruling elites has an effect on which deities get their own space in the form of temples, or find their way through other means. For example, the Tulsi plant is there in almost every Bengali Hindu home. It is an integral part of a Hindu Bengali home, and people don\u2019t keep that plant in spite of misgivings, to put it mildly. They wouldn\u2019t keep it if they were not \u2018fond\u2019 of the practice. If you go to the villages of Bengal, you can still see the Banyan tree being worshiped. But you won\u2019t find any Tulsi or Banyan temple in Bengal. So, how did this plant worship come into the Hindu pantheon? Through tribal pathways, among who it made great sense to sustain, protect and worship the environment. Religion, especially Hinduism, has incorporated many such influences, and worshipping the Tulsi or the Banyan tree, or incorporating wheat and a special kind of grass (dhaan-durba) while blessing someone, among Bengali Hindus are such remnants of tribal influences. No one ever thought of the need to make a temple out of a Tulsi plant or the Banyan tree, because the push or motivation didn\u2019t come from the moneyed and powerful sectors of the Hindu society, and the origins came from the tribals \u2014who weren\u2019t religious or economic elites. But, it\u2019s important to note how the Tulsi plant, which is usually potted in an elevated, tower-like structure, is called: as \u201cTulsi Mandir\u201d (Tulsi temple). It\u2019s situated outside (either in a courtyard or in the balcony) \u2013 doesn\u2019t form part of the chief Gods situated in the worship room (puja ghar). The status of Tulsi as compared to Shiva or Vishnu is not that elevated.  An usual Tulsi plant of a home, in a \u201cTulsi Mandir\u201d. Image Source: File:Basudih - Tulsi mandir.jpg Second, it follows that there is a particular economics of temple formation. Bengal doesn\u2019t have a tradition of having large, sprawling temples as found in Odisha or South India. Those kind of sprawling structures in Bengal are few and far in-between, apart from being quite recent. If one observes the architectural influences, then one can see how temple formation was a direct product of economic, cultural and artistic resources, rather than being solely driven by fondness for a deity. For example, one can see very small temple structures of \u201cShani Temple\u201d (The deity of Saturn) in Bengal. They are numerous, but never huge to make their presence felt. Neither is Shani a much loved or talked about deity among Hindu Bengalis. He is worshipped out of fear, every Saturday (his day; Saturday is called \u201cShani Bar\u201d; bar means day), so that this God remains satisfied so as not to harm people. Similarly, all Bengali Hindu businessmen would have an idol of Ganesha in their shop, since Ganesha is the god of prosperity. But Ganesha temples are very few, compared to space given to other deities. Neither is Ganesh Chaturthi any big deal in Bengal. Lord Ganesha and Bengalis find happiness in being laid back, it could seem.  The Dynamics of Temples in Bengal A majority of temples has either Kali or Radha Krishna as their deities, them being direct influences of Vaishnavism and Shaktism (led to establishment of more Kali temples) being popular elite choices. Vaishnavism made inroads in Bengal in Gupta Age, more enthusiastically after 8th century. Abundant Krishna temples in Bengal bear testimonies of what the preferred deities of the powerful demographic in Bengal wanted to be, especially the one that came with Gaudiya Vaishnavism. The popularization of Krishna by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and the organization that uses his name (ISKCON) receiving large amounts of foreign aid, made it possible to build imposing temple structures. The very popular temple among Bengalis is the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. It was built, \u201cpowered by\u201d Rani Rashmoni, wife of a feudal lord.  Dakhineswar Temple. Image Source The other major, somewhat sprawling temple of Bengal, the Kalighat Kali Temple, was originally a small hut. It was \u201cpowered by\u201d the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury feudal (zamindar) family.[6] Kali is also thought to be an avatar of Durga, so it is not surprising at all that she is a popular deity among Hindu Bengalis. Bengalis do invest in Kali temples here and there, but temple construction by commoners is a rarity. Many of the well-known temples of Bengal also correspond to the Durga/Sati story as intertwined with Shakti Peetha (I\u2019m talking about temples at Tarapith, Fullora, etc, and Bengal has quite a few of them).  Image Source: Shakti Peetha Most of the temples of Bengal were/are built by either aristocratic families (sometimes, waning aristocracies, whereby temple construction somewhat consolidates their name) or very rich people or organizations (Birla-s, ISKCON, etc). If Bengalis manage to save up a little, they would rather use that money to travel or keep on gorging food to the level that their commodes will curse them, but rarely on building temples.  Religious Festivals and Temples The major Hindu festivals (Puja-s) of Bengal are: Saraswati Puja (Goddess of education),Janmasthami (Worship of Krishna, the flute-playing romantic avatar of Vishnu),Shivaratri (worship of Shiva)Vishwakarma Puja (Engineer God or the Architect God),Durga Puja, (Warrior Goddess slaying demons),Laxmi Puja (Goddess of wealth), andKali Puja (Destroyer of evil forces).If you map the above major festivals, with the amount of temples based on the logic fondness = festivals = temples, you will find that temples of only Kali, Krishna and Shiva are frequently occurring in Bengal. And they are rather quite small and humble structures. Saraswati Puja is a huge deal for Bengalis (it\u2019s our own Valentine\u2019s Day, apart from being many other things), but I can\u2019t think of a Saraswati Temple in Bengal. Saraswati puja is arranged and observed by every Bengali school and university, apart from being arranged by neighbourhoods and individual homes. But no school or university has ever established a temple in her name. She is also not kept or maintained in Bengali homes, though all Bengalis would put a book on their forehead (as a mark of reverence) if they happen to touch the book with their feet. If you measure the fondness for Saraswati through this indicator it would make a very faulty reading, because by that logic, Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani, would be much loved Gods among Bengalis. The same goes for Laxmi. She\u2019s usually there in Bengali homes (especially \u201cBangal\u201d homes, Bangal = those who came from Bangladesh around Partition of India), but apart from that specific Laxmi Puja earmarked for her (which happens four days after season finale of Durga Puja in Bengal), you can\u2019t find Laxmi having much space, forget about temples. An interesting nugget of information is that now, Laxmi Puja is always celebrated on a full moon Day (\u2018Kojagori purnima\u2019 in Bengali). But till 12th Century, Laxmi as a goddess wasn\u2019t associated with a full moon day celebration. Religion is an ever-evolving process. However, in Bengal you can find a \u201cChinese Temple\u201d, named after a Chinese person, Tong, Achew. [7] [8]  Chinese devotees light candles in Achipur Temple. Image Source: Achipur ~ Birth Place of Calcutta Chinatown As you enter the Temple you will be surrounded by hordes of Chinese offering prayers to the Chinese Deities. Candles and incense sticks are lit and the table in front of the alter is laid with an most amazing spread, ranging from whole roosted pig to chicken, from bottles of wines to heaps of fruits from exotic spices to expensive nuts. Sadly the mouth watering food is for personal consumption, so it is best to carry your own food. The temple houses the male & female deity of Khuda & Khudi. Although distinctively Chinese in appearance their head gears are predominantly Islamic. Source: Achipur ~ Birth Place of Calcutta Chinatown You\u2019ll find a Firinghi Kalibari, a Kali Temple established by a Portuguese man, Hensman Anthony: Anthony Firingee (Anthony the Foreigner), which is much revered by Hindu Bengalis. And countless Buddhist temples, also frequented by Hindu Bengalis. And Muhammad Ali Park Durga Puja, is one of the oldest and most famous Durga Pujas of Kolkata, powered by the Muslim community: One of the most popular Pujas in Kolkata is at Mohammed Ali Park in North Kolkata. The Durga Puja at Munshiganj, a predominantly Muslim area in Kidderpore in Kolkata, is usually organized by people from the same community. In an article published in the Times of India there is mention of Shahid Ali who is the priest at this Durga Puja. In the article Shahid says, \u201cI fast for a month during Ramzaan and I also fast for four days during Durga Puja to offer my prayers to Ma Durga.\u201d Source: Why Hindu festival of Durga Puja is all about secularism That\u2019s how Bengal and Bengalis roll.
