            "answer_text": "Yesterday the global public was able to catch a glimpse of the reality facing HNW Chinese businesspeople when a video of US citizen Cynthia Liu was smuggled out of China and released to the media. Ms. Liu, a 28 year old Harvard Business School grad who works in NYC for McKinsey & Company, and her 19 year old brother Victor, a Georgetown undergrad, are both naturalized Americans who have spent most of their lives in the United States.  Almost a year ago Ms. Liu, her brother and her mother went to China to visit a dying grandparent. When they attempted to fly home to the US they were stopped by Chinese officials and advised that there was an exit ban preventing them from departing. They were also separated from their mother, whose whereabouts remain unknown. American siblings trapped in China make plea for help There has never been any claim by the Chinese authorities that the Liu siblings or their mother have done anything wrong. Instead, this is a clear example of China attempting to use the leverage by holding the family members hostage for other purposes. In this case the Chinese government is trying to get the Liu children\u2019s long-estranged father, Liu Changming, to return to China. This case is one of many where the Chinese government is clearly demonstrating that it will not hesitate to use methods which every country that believes in the \u201cRule of Law\u201d views as outrageous. The fact that all three family members are US citizens has not helped them at all. Indeed, this technique of using innocent family members as \u201cleverage\u201d has been happening increasingly in China over the past few years without hesitation if it will help the authorities readily put their hands on an accused. In the last few years most people outside of China blithely ignored the world and China\u2019s historical record of \u201cshow trials\u201d and swallowed the Chinese government\u2019s statements that they were simply \u201crooting out corruption\u201d. Overwhelming they accepted that those accused \u201cmust be guilty\u201d. Or they assumed that the \u201cRule of Law\u201d procedures they took for granted\u2026such as \u201cInnocent Until Proven Guilty\u201d\u2026existed in China. Westerners mistakenly assumed that China\u2019s legal system would also provide safeguards against false allegations that might be motivated by political animus or greed in order to seize assets or eliminate business competitors. Such naivet\u00e9 is quickly dissipating as stories such as the Liu siblings and similar cases and the arbitrary arrest of two Canadian businesspeople in retribution for a possible extradition of a favoured Chinese businesswoman come to light. But the risks remain!  Most people are familiar with the Chinese curse \u201cMay you live in Interesting times\u201d . However, most outside of China are NOT familiar with another Chinese curse \u201cMay you come to the attention of the Emperor\u201d . Chinese businesspeople are well aware that the biggest danger to themselves and their family\u2019s safety and prosperity is represented by this second curse. This is especially true since Xi Jinping was made China\u2019s \u201cPresident for Life\u201d in 2018 and ramped up his so-called \u201cAnti-Corruption Campaign\u201d . In fact, in recent years wealthy Chinese businesspeople have started to worry about the \u201cForbes Curse\u201d where, after being mentioned in Forbes magazine, several high-profile Chinese were suddenly snatched, disappeared, show-trialed and sentenced . In addition to long-term incarceration or even death, the state (or others) seized the individual\u2019s assets.  As a result of these new realities at home, for a growing number of wealthy Chinese over the last two decades, there is an increasing desire and urgency to have a some form of a Plan B. The goal was to have this Back-Up Plan protect them , their families and their wealth from arbitrary or politically-motivated actions of the Chinese government (or others using government as a tool for personal gain). The surging desire for wealthy Chinese to secure a comfortable and secure haven has manifested itself in the tremendous increase in the purchase of Citizenships by Investment and overseas Residences by Investment. Recently it has been reported that in 2018 over 100,000 millionaires had acquired Citizenships by Investment or Residences by Investment\u2026otherwise known as \u201cGolden Visas\u201d. And by far most of the buyers were from China.  While I was reading this report the thought kept going through my mind about how many of these buyers had probably committed one or several fatal errors when devising and executing their plans. Based on my thirty years experience in this field, I know that many \u2013 if not most \u2013 had assumed that ALL they had to do was buy a second passport and/or a foreign home. This approach was easy as there has been a multitude of salespeople flaunting their Citizenship by Investment and Residence by Investment \u201cproducts\u201d at busy foreign investment conferences. Sadly, the Chinese purchasers were either blissfully unaware or were ignoring the dangers of two storm clouds of risk that rise out of such an approach to Back-Up Planning.  The First Storm Cloud of Risk \u2013 in China The first storm cloud of risk that many Citizenship by Investment and Residence by Investment purchasers have placed themselves under by their poor planning is that they have underestimated the ingenuity and ruthlessness of the Chinese government. The most spectacular failure on this front was the case of Xiao Jianhua.  Despite having acquired Canadian citizenship and http://passport\u2026.as well as a Diplomatic Passport from Antigua and Barbuda\u2026Mr. Xiao did not understand that these pillars of a Back-up Plan by themselves were not sufficient to fully protect him. Without the other essential elements of an effective Back-Up Plan, Mr. Xiao was powerless to prevent Chinese officials from snatching him from the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong. I was interviewed at the time by the South China Morning Post and gave my thoughts as to his plan\u2019s shortcomings. The Second Storm Cloud of Risk \u2013 in Your New Country The second oft-ignored storm cloud originates from the countries where these individuals have purchased Residence by Investment or Citizenship by Investment. Unfortunately \u2013 and in more cases than I care to count \u2013 real estate and second passport \u201cconsultants\u201d did not properly or fully inform their customers about the important tax and other ramifications of such \u201cproducts\u201d. In many cases, they did not even raise these issues with the buyers\u2026probably for fear of losing the sale! A perfect example is the US EB-5 program. In a prior blog post entitled \u201cEB-5: First of Four Steps to Certain Economic Devastation for Wealthy Chinese\u201d I outlined how a hastily purchased US EB-5 Visa could wreak havoc by the failure to plan for the US tax ramifications of this Residence by Investment product. Increasingly the US government is actively pursuing individuals who may have laundered money to purchase their EB-5 Visas, fund their American lifestyle, and then engaged in tax evasion by under-reporting their worldwide income after arrival. Proper planning with the help of a qualified professional could have prevented this outcome. In a similar way a large number of wealthy Chinese purchased Residence by Investment in Canada under the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program. They then purchased properties in booming cities such as Vancouver and Toronto. But instead of doing legal pre-immigration tax planning, many followed the common \u201cwisdom\u201d that they could easily evade paying income tax by simply failing to declare their non-Canadian source income or by having the main breadwinner relinquish his/her Canadian permanent residence status. They then left the remaining spouse and children occupying their expensive Canadian homes\u2026happily consuming Canada\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d education and medical facilities\u2026 covering their living expenses by tax-free \u201coverseas gifts\u201d. And thinking that this would not be noticed! Rampant application of such \u201cwisdom\u201d caused a historic increase in property prices in Toronto and Vancouver which priced local residents out of the real estate markets. Unbelievably, some individuals not only failed to declare any world-wide income, but went so far as to file for and receive government benefits designated for impoverished Canadians.  Inevitably, such blatant abuse of Canada\u2019s hospitality resulted in media attention and public backlash. The first manifestation of this backlash was the imposition of a speculation tax on non-residents. However, that was just the beginning of the tidal wave of retribution against those who did not properly design and execute Back-Up Plans that included Canada. In March 2019 Canadian authorities formed a task force to identify such abusers. Once identified, the offending parties will inevitably face severe financial and potentially criminal repercussions. And there is more to come \u2013 as this is an election year pressure is on local, provincial and federal politicians to promise to do everything necessary to stamp out this problem. It is worth noting that these second storm clouds are not limited to the US or Canada. The most popular destination for Millionaire Migration\u2026Australia is experiencing the same impact and legislative backlash. Two Storm Clouds of Risk The reality is that many wealthy Chinese and their families will soon find themselves caught up in either a Chinese or foreign thunderstorm unless they immediately recognize the hovering dangers\u2026and then correct and strengthen their current inadequate Back-Up Plans. The irony is that the financial and personal price they and their families will be forced to pay for having a poor or incomplete Back-Up Plan is a fraction of the cost to create and execute an effective long-term back-up plan from the beginning. But it\u2019s not too late to fix it! Edit 1: Earlier this week Liu Shiyu was reported in the press to have \u201cvolunteered\u201d to surrender himself to the tender mercies of the Chinese justice system. One may remember that he was the chief securities enforcer who was the one prosecuting the other allegedly corrupt businesspeople. Given that it \u201cwas reported\u201d that he volunteered, being the somewhat sceptical person that I am (or that the above caused me to be) I will pose the following questions: Did he really volunteer, or was this just the cover story for another midnight kidnapping/arrest?If he did \u201cvolunteer\u201d, was there leverage used such as threats against family members?No matter how you spin it, this may very well be a case of the executioner being scapegoated for the excesses or power grabs of those ordering the executions. Not unprecedented in history.  Nikolai Yezhov ",

            "answer_text": "I am a Chinese, left my country with my 5 years boy, and my husband. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s other person\u2019s motivation of immigration. But I would like to share mine - hope it helps to understand the situation better. My husband and I both worked in large cities for many year. We had a decent life, with all the years of hard work in large international companies. I used to work in a professional media company, and my husband worked for those IT companies for years. We bought our detached house in the suburb of Shanghai, with a lot of Morgage of course. And then I had my baby boy. It seemed everything went on well. We read many sad stories from the media, but personally, you would think that\u2019s just stories for most of the time. With many of his friends, my husband used to went to an island very often. It\u2019s near Xiamen, a city he lived and worked for over 10 years in the east of China. There they discovered a small restaurant at the seaside - the owner offers wonderful fresh seafood - a perfect runaway activity for them in the weekends. After left that Xiamen city many years, one day, we received a friend\u2019s call for help. As her family still visited the restaurant sometimes, she and her husband becomes friends with the owner soon. And she\u2019s calling for the owner, calling for help. It was the owner\u2019s son, a 14 years boy. He was suddenly found sick for no clues - his platelet number dropped so horrifyingly, even to a single digital level. The local doctors couldnot find out what\u2019s wrong at all. All these happened within a month. We were living in the center of the country Shanghai then, and my husband was majored in bio-chemistry. So that this friend called us for help, searching for any good medical resources in Shanghai that might help the boy. We did many searching for them. We found out the best hospital in Shanghai and tried to convince them coming to visit it. However, the boy was too weak to make any further moves - he died several weeks later, no one knew that\u2019s going on on him by the time he died. One year later, we were contacted by that friend again - she\u2019s helping the restaurant owner with a new question. For many years, there has been a factory in about 7km distance towards his island. That factory produces P-Xylene, locally called it PX factory. That week, in the news, they found out there was an explosive incident happened in the factory. The owner\u2019s wife was pregnant at the moment. They wanted to know if that would do any harm to her baby. We spent several nights doing our research. Every Chinese media release says it\u2019s safe. However, we read a lot of international research articles, and studied the production process. Sadly, we found out, all the symptoms the died boy had, exactly matches benzene poisoning. And that benzene, was a mid product of that factory. My own baby was about 6 months at that moment. As a sentiment new mom, I cried over night for that 14- year boy passed away. I asked my husband the same question over and over- \u201cshould we find out the reason earlier, would it make any difference?\u201d It seems there\u2019s no good way for final treatment to the poisoning. We called the friend in the early morning, telling her all about that. She\u2019s a new mom as well, with a boy 9 months old by then. She tried to convince the owner leaving the island, but they told her they had no choice. That\u2019s their homeland, and a only place they know how to live, with all the islanders of an over 7000 population. Both my friends and us tried to warn to our friends - we posted warnings with the whole story on all our social media. But, all the posts were deleted within mintues. It was no an \u201callowed\u201d topic. Two months later, my husband finally rises the immigration topic between us. I understood his feeling, just as mine. The owner thought he had no choice. We think we do. Looking at my son - he has an allergic problem to the highly- polluted air, worked just as a monitor. When our weather forecast said it\u2019s a bad day(pm 2.5 over 300, or even 400), his nose would become so sensitive that it starts to bleed constantly, 6\u20137 times per day. Luckily, my family still had a choice. Sadly, we had no choice. We applied for immigrant. After piles of materials preparation, we finally received the approval. Then we sold everything there - house, car, everything. We left our friends, our job, and our home, with no choice. Yes, there are rich Chinese who seeking to hide their dirty money somewhere. But there are more common ones, just as us, seeking for fresh air. ",
