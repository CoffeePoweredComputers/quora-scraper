            "answer_text": "Depends on the sports and the league your in. In Europe, with footbal/soccer, the player is allowed to negotiate himself and therefore he can stop the trade from happening if he does not agree with the demands. In America, in the NHL, but I guess in all the big sports, there is trading of players without any money coming into play. So if the team decides to swap you, you have to go to the team you are swapped to, no matter if you do or do not like them. Only preventive action you can take as a player is to get a No movement clause in your contract, which prevents your team from trading you to anyone. ",
