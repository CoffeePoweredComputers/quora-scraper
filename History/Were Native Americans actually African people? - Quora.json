            "answer_text": "UPDATED. No, and Yes. So let me explain this first. Im not one of those people that theorize that Black people are Native Americans and there is a elaborate hoax to trick everyone of this information. Here is a big source of confusion, the oldest remains of a Human found in the Americas was of a woman that would be considered \u201cnegro\u201d by phenotype \u201clooks\u201d: Luzia Woman, 11,500 year old remains, found in whats now Brazil Luzia Woman: a skeleton of a woman that is one of the oldest human remains in the Americas:  UPDATED Apparently there is controversy on how Luiza woman looked. according to the lead researcher. Since shes had \u201cNegroid\u201d and \u201cMongoloid\u201d features that match many pro-ethnicities of the time. Most people today are a combination or proto ethnicities that bear some simulates to the modern ethnicities but are not 100% the same. Native Americans are general of Asian and Euro-Asian decent. Shes was defiantly a proto-Native American and they will change the outcome of the reconstruction to reflect Native peoples.    Based on Human Adaptation its more than likely that she had some strong Asian and African features which may have averaged out into the population over time similar to Kennewick Man .  People adapt to their environment. We know this because the oldest remains of a person from the UK retained more of their African traits and had Black skin: Cheddar Man 10,000 year old remains, Found in the UK, Dark skin and BLUE eyes First modern Britons had 'dark to black' skin, Cheddar Man DNA analysis reveals:  (Cheddar Man, possible Descendant)  But this was going back 100,000 years, so Luzia woman was part of an earlier migration. Most of recent ancestry is from Asia / Eurasia:  So the vast majority of Native Americans are from Asia. You can stretch the truth and say all Asians are from Africa so Native Americans are Africans, but that would be a lie. There is a map based on Fossil, DNA, and linguistic evidence. It shows the routs people took to get from place to place:  I do believe there were African explorers / traders, however it\u2019s not to the extent of populating a whole new continent. ",

There\u2019s still a lot to learn about the first humans in our continent, but there\u2019s plenty of genetic evidence of Upper Paleolithic human groups reaching Alaska from Siberia, and moving south very quickly to occupy Central and South America.[1] If there was any group of a recognizable modern African ancestry to arrive before the Spaniards, they left no trace whatsoever.
