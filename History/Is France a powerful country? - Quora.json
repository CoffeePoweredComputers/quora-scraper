            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define power.  In terms of global macroeconomics (2017): France is still ranking in the top 10 economies in the world, with 4% of the global GDP.It has 59 companies in the Forbes Global 2,000, despite only representing 0.80% of the world\u2019s population. That number is above that of India and even Germany, but below that of the UK (90+) and far behind the US (550).It has companies ranking at number 1 in strategic industries such as Luxury Goods, Construction Materials, Electrical Equipment and Energy & Water Treatment.However, if you look at these indexes over a longer period of time, the picture starts to get darker: In 1980 its growth rate was one of the highest (top 5) in the world with 5%. In 2017, the growth rate is almost at a standstill, with 0.50%, ranking it in the bottom quadrant of the G20, far below that of the US 3%, or India 1.40%, Russia 1.08% and even the EEC 0.60%.It is twice as corrupt as Germany, but half as Spain, and a third as Italy.Its credit rating has been downgraded to AA in 2015, one grade below that of the United States, and two grade below that of Germany.The downgrading of the credit rating is in connection with one of the worst problems that France is facing since the 1980\u2019s: the lack of control on its national debt. Compared to Germany (68% of GDP), France\u2019s debt represent over 95% of its GDP and though the trend is stabilizing, it is still growing.The issue with the national debt shows another symptom of France\u2019s decline: the incompetence of its governments (social democrats and liberals) since the 1980s to implement crucial reforms to get a better control of its balance sheet. In comparison, Germany was able to implement reforms successfully even in the middle of the global economic crisis of 2008. So far this analysis shows that France still remains an economic leader compared to other major developed economies. It still has: Diplomatic influence on international relations, even when it comes to questions of ecology (eg. Paris Accords on climate control, Military and Diplomatic Leadership during the Yugoslavian Wars).It has a modern nuclear deterrent and strong economic ties in certain areas of the world (eg. Africa, Middle-East) that makes it a must have ally even to much more military and economically powerful countries like the US.It most certainly has a cultural influence on the world thanks to a lead in luxury goods and gourmet food, and as one of the leaders when it comes to promoting Human Rights.But this is without counting that: Its diplomatic influence has receded significantly since World War II (language talked by diplomats used to be French) and especially since the fall of the Soviet Union.It is significantly challenged economically in Africa where China is now the biggest contributor and has been able to negotiate franchises for most of the raw materials on the continent (note: the US don\u2019t fare much better in that regards).It has supported some of the worst dictatorial and genocidal regimes in history, most particularly in Africa, which has served its strategic and economic interests but has made it a persona non grata with many in the region.It has made enemies with powerful allies such as the US, at crucial times in the world\u2019s history, including harboring the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini until the 1979 Iranian Revolution - and while the US continuously supported the dictatorial regime of the Shah. Finally, the worst is when it comes to the social economic situation inside France: Its GDP Per Capita measured in terms of Purchasing Power Parity falls to a grim 10th rank, below that of the EEC, far below the US (2) and Germany (5).While its social security and healthcare system is (self)declared one of the best in the world, it is actually crippling the country\u2019s budget and the need to reform critical areas of development such as education and the promotion of entrepreneurship. The total budget for social security and healthcare is of 440 billion euros (2017) versus 420 billion euros for the country\u2019s entire budget including 100 billion for education, 40 billion for defense, and 15 billion for employment measures. For comparison, the US federal budget is 3,800 billion dollars.The national debt is one of the biggest in the world, with 2,000 billion euros (this is obviously dwarfed by the federal US debt of 24,000 billion).It has a significant amount of its best graduates leaving the country to work abroad - of the 1.6 million French expatriates, 50% have a Master\u2019s degree or PhD, and 25% have at least 2 years of under-graduation studies.A vast amount of its high net worth population is leaving the country at a fast pace.It has a disintegrated society with rampant racism and xenophobia affecting all the layers of the population, and its politicians are inconsistent when it comes to religious practice (e.g. ban wearing religious symbols, but finance places of worship with public money) and this despite the constitutional nature of France as a laic country since 1904.",

            "answer_text": "YES Some E.U. leaders call for France to relinquish its seat on the Security COuncil of the United Nations in favour of a European seat. After all France\u2019s rank dates back to WW2, and in the meantime a lot has changed in the world. However when France utters the request that the other E.U. countries should accept a larger share of the cost of its peacekeeping missions in Africa, they all compete in finding good excuses for shirking in front of this responsability ! France is paying for its global worldwide rank with a price in BLOOD and CASH. Nobody is happy with a blood-thirsty Moslem extremist enclave in the middle of the African continent, but trying to stop the contagion by sending soldiers on the spot is a price they refuse to pay. The UK after WW2 got rid of its colonial empire by giving independance to all the countries involved, whether they were ready for this status or not. France is mantaining to this day its sovereignity on all continents by claiming that Martinique, Guyana, R\u00e9union, Mayotte, Tahiti etc. are all inhabited by French citizens who have the same rights to economic assistance as those of the European continent. The globe has numerous areas of conflict, political or military. They involve confrontations, either because shooting is going on or because projecting power in the area is important to avoid potential wars. When Bush Sr. went to war against Saddam Hussein to liberate Koweit, French armed forces were present as part of the UN coalition both on the ground and in the air. When Bush Jr. wanted the United Nations to endorse his intervention in Iraq for the spurious pretext of Weapons of Mass Destruction, France with its veto has prevented the U.N. to repeat the same broad based consensus \u2026The USA went on its own in the second Iraq war and made a terminal mess of the whole Middle East. For France being an independant power means the ability ot say \u201cNo\u201d when the circumstances warrant it. In the Far East China is pursuing an imperialistic agenda in the South China Sea, and among the military vessels that challenge this ambition France is again on the side of the US. reassuring Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. However when US President Trump annonces the withdrawal of his country\u2019s troops from Syria, leaving the only fighting anti-I.S. Kurd troops at the mercy of Bashar el-Assad France has announced that its limited forces would not follow the US example and stay on. Apparently Donald Trump believes that the US is at liberty to decide which country should commerce with Iran and which shouldn\u2019t \u2026and at the same time announces that making America great again means withdrawing from the role of policeman of the world ! The right question should be : \u201cIs the US still a great power today ?\u201d. ",
