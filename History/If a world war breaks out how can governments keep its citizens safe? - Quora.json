In England during the Second World War they sent schoolchildren and a fair number of adults to the countryside to stop the damage of Nazi air strikes on London and other cities. The country would have its own defence system, anti air missiles etc, radars, warnings and evacuation points etc. The rest of the population would try get on with everyday life, keep the economy from stagnating. The country would also have agressive tactics, if you drop bigger bombs on Nazi Germany for example it\u2019s harder for them to keep focusing on their foreign bombing campaign. ",
