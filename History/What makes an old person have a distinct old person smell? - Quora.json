            "answer_text": " To say that an old person has a distinct old person smell, is a generalisation. Everybody smells in some way. Smell isn't ageist. Smell affects you at any age, at any point in your life. Gum disease, leads to decay. Having rotting molars in your teeth. Gives a person halitosis. Whenever you're brushing your teeth. Suffering from excess sweating, hyperhidrosis. Doctors usually treat this problem with botox, which freezes the sweat gland. I'm not sure it works, but it may help. When we fart, it smells. Everybody at any age farts. Aging may lead to a person being unable to reach intimate places when bathing. Giving rise to a bad smell. When food is brought hot to the table, the steam it emits rises. Our bodies in turn gives off invisible gases. The way in which we all smell is determined by the foods & the medication we eat. When I spent time in hospital, I stank. I was in bits, because my illness prevented me from washing, as the doctors were carrying out test after test on me. They didn't smell me, and I was pleased, but then again, British doctors are trained not to say, \u201cYou smell,\u201d to their patients. Out of earshot, who knows what they say? At one point, I even turned around, to look at where the smell was coming from. There was nobody to blame except me. Nightmare. I couldn't wait to shower away my stench. After my periods I smelt bad. After a heavy workout, I smell of good old fashioned sweat. I'm not ashamed of that. Pheromones attract humans in different ways. The smells humans emit, can sometimes have a negative response, or a positive response. Some people prefer not to wash, letting their their natural body odour show, others use deodorant. I used to wear perfume, but in time I began to hate the smell of perfume, as it gives me headaches. I\u2019ve lost count of the amount of times, a person walks by, and is drenched in perfume, and I have to hold my nose or walk in another direction. If I take in the smell of perfume, and it registers in my nostrils, I\u2019ve got a banging headache for the whole day. I sleep it off, without painkillers, to feel sane again. It\u2019s not necessary to put the whole bottle of perfume on. To mask the smell of BO, making it doubly worse. It\u2019s a turnoff. It doesn't matter if it's really expensive or cheap perfume, I can't stand the smell. I dislike marketing campaigns whereby celebrities endorse, their own range of branded perfumes, to entice you to buy them, because if you do, somehow it miraculously turns you into them. They market their perfume on a grand scale, and the big marketing machine keeps on churning them out. Aging comes with its own unique set of problems. Every person ages differently. I can only advise. Try to keep your limbs as flexible as possible. Eventually, you\u2019ll be able to touch tour toes. Stretch every morning you wake up, (if you can). Take up running, walking or lift dumbbells or weights. Anything to get the blood circulating around your body. In time, you\u2019ll be able to touch your toes. Open as many windows around your house or flat. If you're unable to do this, get someone to help you massage your limbs. Everytime I go into Superdrug, different assistants ask me the same question, \u201cWould you like to try one of our perfumes, madam?\u201d My reply is always the same, \u201cI hate perfumes, they give me a headache, I prefer creams instead.\u201d With the creams I use, I end up not smelling of any brand name, and that's the way I like it I won't advertise the brand of cream I use or the deodorant I wear, the companies\u2019 make enough money as it is. I don't get caught up in the latest must have. The latest must have is to treat one another with kindness and respect. As long as they don't flood the creams I use with perfume, I'm safe for now. ",

            "answer_text": "I look after \u201cold people\u201d in a clinical setting day in, day out. There really is no such thing as a \u201cdistinct old person smell\u201d. Some elderly people come in smelling of the ubiquitous lavender and talc or aftershave and possibly cologne. They are the lucky ones, who are either still in full possession of their mental and physical abilities, or who have family or carers who have the physical and mental capabilities to look after them with real love and care. Some elderly people come in smelling of urine/excrement or smelling like they haven't washed in a long, long time. They are the unlucky ones. The ones who have lost the ability to look after themselves and control their bodily functions, through mental or physical decline. They are the ones who are either too proud or too alone to ask for help, or whose family/carers can't or won't meet their needs. Bear in mind that this is not always intentional neglect \u2014 caring for people with dementia or other conditions can be a horribly demanding, draining and exhausting task. It takes a huge, huge toll. Often, the full time carer is in fact the equally elderly and potentially physically frail spouse. Sometimes elderly people come in smelling of leg ulcers. No matter how good their hygiene is otherwise, the overriding odour of leg ulcers is the smell that prevails. And so on. There really is no distinct old person smell, although I will admit that a clean, well cared for older person doesn't smell like a young person (I actually think that even clean, well cared for younger people smell worse than their elders) There are a range of different smells directly linked to the medical conditions of the person and the capabilities of the person and the people around them.
