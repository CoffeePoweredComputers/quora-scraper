            "answer_text": "What does it cost to raise a cow? What do you do to raise a cow? Well, in essence, you let it eat grass until it gets big then you kill it and eat it. What does it cost to grow grass? What do you do to grow grass? Well, you let the sun shine on it and let the rain get on it. What does that cost? Despite what many would have you believe it does not cost more to NOT innoculate a cow than it does to make sure it stays healthy. Thus, it does not cost any more to raise a cow in the meadows of Yorkshire than it does on the prairies of Texas. British business people price goods according to a concept of \u201cWhat the market will bear\u201d. In other words, if people are prepared to get ripped off why sell a product at a reasonable price? In other words \u201cNever give a sucker an even break\u201d. Brits will pay for a 1 inch thick sirloin steak the same amount of money as Texans will pay for an entire brisket. And as long as Brits think that\u2019s OK they will keep being charged that amount of money and British butchers will consider themselves perfectly justified in charging ripoff prices. I recommend a book written by Lindy Woodhead called \u201cShopping, Seduction and Mr Selfridge\u201d. It\u2019s about an American who came to Britain, opened a very successful store and dragged British retail kicking and screaming out of the stone age by treating customers with respect. ",

Perhaps I\u2019m wildly out of touch but that doesn\u2019t seem expensive to me. Premium cuts of beef and lamb are more expensive, but they are cheap enough that they are widely purchased - and hence non-premium cuts are very cheap, as are processed meat products that make use of them. Many people advocating healthy diets suggest you shouldn\u2019t eat meat more than about 4 times a week, no idea if that\u2019s true - but they complain that (good) vegetables are more expensive than meat so people are not encouraged to do so.
