            "answer_text": "There is a big difference between feeling comfortable everyday and feeling sexy. A lace thong certainly feels sexy but I can assure you that at no point during the day are you not fully aware you are wearing a lace thong. Sexy yes, comfortable sometimes\u2026 For my daily wear I do wear very comfortable underwear. Sometimes in the store they are labeled men's, sometimes they are labeled women's. I've always hated boxers because they ride up and the starchy cotton Hanes men's briefs we have been socially pushed to wear all our lives feel like wearing cardboard all day. Like I tell people who know I wear ladies underwear, I just want to be comfortable, it's not a statement. If these companies who make underwear simply put the comfortable, smooth, and non restricting underwear in the men's s section with a tag that said \u201cmens\u201d they would fly off the shelf. So in my experience look for: Boy colours (all mine I can change at the pool without question, I'm not usually a \u201cconformer\u201d but why make a scene?)\u201cBikini\u201d is the type to start withSize is usually straight across. Men's L is a woman's LYou need a mid level waist line. Same level as normal men's briefs. If you get low waist your junk hangs out the top. Sounds sexy, looks and feels ridiculous.Look for stretchy. Silk looks comfy but won't hold anything, junk falls out the sides. Look for the nylon spandex kind of stuffAnd finally the #1 feature that is a must have is the leg holes need the elastic bands. Just trust me, you are wasting your money without the elastics at the waist and legs. I never realized before I started shopping that 60% of women's underwear doesn't have the elastic! I don't understand how that's comfortable but men need this to keep everything contained.Well that's my wisdom on picking. The journey is half the fun though. ",
