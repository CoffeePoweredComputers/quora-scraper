            "answer_text": "Other religions are based on the permanence. Buddhism is based on the philosophy of impermanence. Therefore, there is no permanent God that can save you, clean your sin or help you to get Heaven. There are spirits and super natural beings in the text of Buddhism. But those beings are not the center or base of the Buddhism. Buddhist doesn't believe that God creates the universe or creates the human beings or if they surrender in God, he can save you\u2026 they don't have such kind of beliefs. Buddha is a human being but you will see many texts in Buddhism referring him as the omniscient and omnipotent as well as the supreme being of 31 realms. But, he doesn't create the universe nor human beings, he doesn't punish or handing out rewards to human. The law of Nature which is called Dhamma already exists whether Buddha finds it out or not. The law applies to everyone even if you don't believe in Buddha. There isn't one natural law for Buddhists and another natural law for non Buddhists. You don't need to believe something or someone to practice mindfulness meditation. Actually, believing something or someone can be biased and you need to be open minded to practice the meditation. Inconclusion, Buddhism is not about God. It\u2019s about searching the truth through your pure and concentrated mind. In science, you use materials to test the subject. Here, you use yourself to test yourself. Nivarrna is the ultimate objective in Buddhism. But, that doesn't mean it is the ultimate objective for Buddhists. He who doesn't want to seek the truth or attain Nirvana doesn't test the Buddha teaching and just accepting his words or worshipping Buddha, Dhamma and Sanga. That makes many people get confused and arguments arise whether Buddhism is a religion or not, Philosophy or not, atheist or theist. Buddhism is nothing and everything depending on your approach. You are using your own religion or knowledge or experience to define the Buddhism and you will never get a true answer. Buddhism has two parts which is understandable for ordinary humans and a part which is enlightened ones or the ones who\u2019s walking the path can understand. It starts analysing human beings but it ends up outside of human minds or knowledge or experience are capable to understand. The other religions are different. You are trying to understand the God and trying to follow him and awaiting the punishment or reward from him and hoping to get into Heaven. Buddhism doesn't find out about God. Finding out about God is chasing the illusion. The aim is to go out of illusion not after the illusion. ",

            "answer_text": "Buddhism is the remedy for religion. The aim of Buddhism, if it can be said to have an aim, is to create environment in which the trouble caused by belief is stifled. It does this by putting you through a series of rigorous practices which show you your own hypocrisy, and culminate in an attitude of fierce equanimity towards the world. In the film Silence (based on the 1966 novel), which is about 17th century Jesuit missionaries attempting to spread the Gospel in Japan, the inquisitor Inoue repeatedly tells priest Rodrigues that the reason his religion won\u2019t spread is because, \u201cJapan is a swamp.\u201d What is meant by this is that state authorities, in cooperation with Buddhist monks, had over centuries cultivated an environment in Japan in which belief simply could not take root. They manufactured a variety of practices and attitudes which did not allow vindication. The inquisitor systematically strips Rodrigues of all the tools he has to justify his beliefs, which in the end serves to make Rodrigues look as ugly and insincere as everybody else. For example, when Rodrigues is captured, he utters the ancient Christian saying, \u201cthe blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church,\u201d as if his beliefs are so strong that he\u2019s even transcended the fear of death. So what does Inoue do? He simply does not allow for Rodrigues to become a martyr. The result is that when Rodrigues is no longer able to vindicate his beliefs, he reveals himself to be just as terrified of death as everybody else. In other words, Inoue does not allow the beliefs to play themselves out, and as such they are made to look hollow and insincere. Silence is a film that leaves you with a strange empty, anti-climactic feeling. This is because we expect the two missionaries to embark on an expedition to the ends of the Earth where they will either succeed or die trying, sticking neatly to the story arc of an ancient heroic epic and thus satisfying our Western story-telling sensibilities. What actually happens is the narrative equivalent of taking the keys out of a speed boat at full speed and watching it slowly grind to a halt until dead in the water. Rodrigues is not resisted by Japan so much as suffocated by it, until he effectively becomes the bitch of a society he set out to transform. The story is basically an exploration of what happens when belief meets a society grounded in Buddhism. Buddhism does not offer a contrasting belief system, against which other belief systems can vindicate themselves. Its aim is rather to affirm the groundlessness of all belief systems, and it does this by grinding you into the dirt until all your inconsistencies have been totally ironed out. I would go so far to as say that true Buddhism is actually the great destroyer of religion. As Alan Watts so astutely observed, Buddhism is best thought about as a form of psychotherapy. Its objective is to wean you off dependence upon myths and stories, which is the original sense of the word \u2018humiliation\u2019; to put you back on the humus, the ground, where you belong. If you\u2019re a religious individual and you come across a Buddhist, I suggest you run as fast as your legs can carry you and don\u2019t look back. ",

            "answer_text": "The Abrahamic religions, Judaism , Christianity and Islam, claim that an all powerful deity created everything, and concerns himself with our behavior, rewarding or punishing it according to his rules. This view is not typical in other religions. Buddhism in particular is the teaching of what his followers believe to have been a fully enlightened person who lived about 500 years BCE. Many if the teachings of this person, Siddhartha Gautama, (\u201cthe Buddha\u201d is a title not a name), have parallels in other religions. For instance , where Jesus said \u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you\u201d, the Buddha said, \u201cDo not do unto others that which you do not wish done to you\u201d. Buddhism teaches that there is no self, person, ego or soul which can be \u201dgot at\". To awake, or become enlightened, to this truth is to achieve liberation. Many teachings of Hinduism are shared by Buddhists, such as the belief in karma, (\u201ccause and effect\u201d), reincarnation, and several meditation practices and levels of insight. What is unique to Buddhism is the practice of mindfulness, which involves paying attention to what is happening right here and now, without grasping at it. This practice is calming, and counteracts the tendency to experience emotional highs and lows. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer for the question is Buddhism is not different from other Eastern religions. The following are the basic principles of Eastern religions \"- There is no creation ex nihilo ( creation out of nothing). Everything exists from eternity. The guiding principle is ' From nothing, nothing comes'. In Sanskrit , Abavane Bhavanasti. Anything created requires something existing prior to creation and is inferior and liable for destruction. The Supreme Being therefore doesn't create. It only projects or manifests itself as the physical world.Man and God : Because there is no creation, there is no difference between man and the supernatural being . Even if you don't believe in a supernatural being, it cannot obscure the fact that you were not created. In a sense you are in existence from eternity. In other words, you are God whether you like it or not. Both God and man are two sides of the same coin.Karma theory and rebirth: You are born in this world because of your past karma. You will die and be reborn endlessly unless you break this cycle. It is only with regard to breaking this cycle of birth ,death and rebirth that the Eastern Religions adopt different modes.Caste difference: One implication of the karma theory is caste difference based on birth.Now let us examine some of the general claims made on behalf of Buddhism. Before that one should know that like any other religion there is much difference between core beliefs and actual practice in Buddhism :- a. Buddhism has no place for God: In reality Buddha himself is worshipped as God by a majority of the Buddhist. Not only Buddha but innumerable deities are worshipped in the Tantric Buddhism aka Vajrayana. In fact one reason for the decline of Buddhism in India was because in later stages it accepted all the Brahminical gods into its fold, thereby obscuring the difference between Brahminical Hinduism and Buddhism.As we noted in point 2 above , there is no need to believe in God in Eastern religions. This is true for Hinduism also where belief in God is only optional . One sect of Hinduism purvamimamsa actually denies the existence of God or Brahman. In Hinduism, the concept of atheism is unknown. The word used to describe unbelievers is nastika and it means one who denies the supremacy of the Vedas and not the existence of God or Brahman. One may ask why do ,then ,Hindus worship millions of gods. The reason is like in Buddhism in practice people need gods. Therefore , the concept of ' no god ' is not unique to Buddhism. It is not out of place to note that Eastern religions which make God optional or deny God have spawned many gods in practice and have to derive philosophical justification for the same. b. No punishment or reward from God: This concept is shared by Hinduism as well, even if it subscribes to the existence of Brahman. One's own karma produces reward and punishment, both in this life and in the next life. God or Brahman is not responsible for your karma. This concept is so rigid that both good karma and bad karma have to run their course before one gets liberation. For this reason, Hinduism has temporary Heaven and Hell. On death, after suffering for the bad karma in Hell and enjoying the good in Heaven, one comes back to earth. There is no set off between good and bad Karma. This birth-death-rebirth cycle, cycle known as samsara continues unless broken. Of course, the enjoyment/ suffering in this world for past Karma itself makes it a sort of second temporary Heaven/ Hell. In Buddhism life itself is looked upon as punishment for it is nothing but dukkha. In other words, it looks upon life itself as Hell. It should be noted that life originated out of past Karma. It is to break the cycle of birth- death-rebirth,that Buddhism prescribes ways. Since there is no God to punish, you are punished by your own Karma.Therefore, the concept of not being punished / rewarded by God is not unique to Buddhism. c.No Heaven: Though not named Heaven, there is a state called ' Nirvana or cosmic consciousness ' or 'Buddhahood' or Buddhsatva which is the goal of every Buddhist. It is where one loses the effects of karma and has no dukkha. The actual state is not clear, but there won't be any God. Calling Heaven by some other name doesn't make it much different. Therefore, this concept is not unique to Buddhism. d.Philosophy of impermanence: This, it should be admitted is unique to Buddhism. But on a closer look it is evident that not everything is impermanent as claimed. The theory of impermanence created a huge problem for the Buddhist and this can be understood only by considering some of the factors that gave rise to Buddhism. Brahminical Hinduism had three things as core faith: Brahman or God who was unchangeable/ unchanging, a permanent soul and the Vedas which were not of human origin ( in philosophical jargon uncreated). Buddhism had to take exactly the opposite stand on these three fundamental tenets of Hinduism. It had to deny the existence of God, Soul and the Vedas to show it was different from Hinduism. Denying the Vedas was not difficult and its place was taken by Tripitakkas, the holy scriptures of Buddhism. But the other two required complicated philosophical reasoning. Buddhism had to formulate the concept of impermanence to deny the existence of God and Soul. Then the question arose, how to account for rebirth and karma theories which Hinduism also subscribed to. If everything was impermanent what was reborn? If it was the same that existed in the previous birth, then it becomes permanent. If it was different, the theory of karma fails because past Karma cannot be attached to a new entity. The solution to this problem was theory of ' dependent origination' which in effect means new life is not fully new and not fully old. To explain what then the essence of a human being means and what should be strived for , the concept of Talagatha was derived later. The concept of Talagatha and Brahman are more or less same and even there is an accusation that the concept of Brahman was stolen by the Brahmins. Since there is no creation ex-nihilo in Eastern religions , the world of reality is to be accounted for. This is done through the concept of dependent origination in Buddhism and in Hinduism, by the concept of projection or manifestation . The difference between these two concepts is one of degree and not substance. Further, if Nirvana is not a permanent state, it makes no sense to escape from the cycle of birth and death. . Life becomes an eternal hell, if there is no ultimate final state for realization by human beings. So, there is something that is permanent in Buddhism, though it is not openly accepted. Therefore, this concept is not unique to Buddhism. d.No God to save you , to clean your sin or help you get Heaven: Since one's life is governed by one's own karma, the questions of a savior, forgiveness of sin and getting you to heaven does not arise. This is concept applies to Hinduism also. Every man has to work his own way to liberation from birth and death cycle. But here also, there is a difference of opinion among the Buddhists. There is the concept of Bodhisattvas who deliberately avoid attainng Buddhahood to help others in getting to the path of Buddhahood e. Acceptance of Caste system: Buddhism accepts caste system but throws open the priesthood to people of all castes. Hinduism is rigid in this regard and considers only Brahmins eligible for priesthood. Also , the Brahmopadesham which is mandatory for learning Vedas is restricted only to Brahmins. There is no such restriction in Buddhism. Conclusion: On the whole, Buddhism is no different from other Eastern religions. It differs only in the methods suggested for liberation or attaining Buddhahood. Therefore, Hinduism considers Buddhism as one of its sects and the historical Buddha, an incarnation of Vishnu. It is true that some sects in Hinduism believe that soul and the Supreme Being are different, in eternal punishment of souls, surrender as a means of emancipation but such views are within the aforesaid principles ",

            "answer_text": "Buddhism changed religion forever.  Before Buddhism in religions such as Brahmanism and Judaism you had:  1) external fire rituals, 2) ritual blood sacrifices, 3) magical mantras and formulas, 4) caste system by birth - you were born and died in your caste (Jews too had a caste system btw) and a 5) blind faith - those texts were divine revelation, do not question their authority.  6) ethics and initiation defined in terms of caste --- ex, \"of course he lies! That is why he is low caste\"7) ideas of clean food and unclean food and rituals to prepare food.8) everyone outside that religion is a barbarian untouchable.  9) only the highest castes were allowed to meditate or be initiated -- initiation was by secret mantra (Gayatri for Hindus, name of God for Jews) so low castes and barbarians could not hear.   10) Locative - brahmanism and Judaism must be practiced within the confines of their respective \"holy lands\" other wise religion does not work since they could not correct the electromagnetic imbalances in other lands.  In Brahmanism this is known as Kala Pani or black water, for Jews they must return to the holy land to their temple and offer blood sacrifice only there. 11) Highest path could only be practiced by men of the highest caste.  Women were cut off. 12) only had 8 planes of existence.  Brahmins said 8th heaven was Vaikuntha (see Mahabharata), Jews said their God was in 8 heaven - the highest. Buddhism changed all that.   1) it begins with a proof of Buddha's Supremacy - 4 Noble Truths is a recursive algorithm which becomes a proof by induction.  It utilizes fractal symmetry to align subatomic particles.  (See Eightfold Way in Physics)...people are finding this is true 2500 years later. If you are truly God, you better provide proof of something only God can know. 2) Kalama Sutta - you have a right to question all texts and \"authority\".  You don't have to except anything you don't understand, keep it to the side.  Practice what you understand. Question, use reason. 3) although Buddha is God in Buddhism (every Sutta begins with the term BHAGVAN which means God in Indian languages) you too can practice to become Buddha.   You don't have to take His word for it.  You can test this claim by practicing to become a future Buddha.   4) Centrality of SELF sacrifice and ethics and deeds - same ethical standards for everyone!  Did not matter which caste you are. So now it's inner self sacrifice, no external fire rituals. 5) practice focus on developing ethics, love and compassion for ALL beings,  magical mantras secondary.   6) all food is clean as long as it was gotten through honest livelihood.   7) Buddhism could be practiced by man, women or child for the highest attainment. 8) can be practiced anywhere, which is why Buddhism was the first international religion. 9) Buddhism smashed through a mere 8 planes and gave us 31 planes of existence!!! Around 16-20 more heavens than religions with a mere 7 heavens.  That makes Buddhist gods the highest and Buddha the highest God. ",

I always try to research anything I thought it would be good to know more about and the Christian teaching had good ethics but were far too impossible with believing in magic as I drifted into no religion. However I did suffer from a guilt feeling from a childhood brain washing for many years. It became obvious that some religions might have something sensible about them. Ignoring the obvious showmanship for example in the Christian religion they have tall building high enough for 4 meter tall people, spooky organ music and priests walking robot like in dress ups carrying death signs. Although it became obvious that religions were based on old superstitions, I met a nice Buddhist girl and thought her religion was an Asian religion worshiping a fat guy sitting cross legged with a silly temple like hat, not as nice shade hat like I wear in the hot sun. That religion was another subject I started researching just in case this girl would take after me with a meat cleaver or something.

Buddhism is a religion to about 300 million people around the world. The word comes from 'budhi', 'to awaken'.

            "answer_text": "I have practiced Nichiren Shoshu True Buddhism since 1974 Nichiren Shoshu True Buddhism \u2022 NST Nichiren Shoshu Temple Buddhism in general is not a God based religion. Instead of having \u201cFaith\u201d that an outside force controls our fate, we practice to develop the inherent \u201cEnlightenment\u201d and harmonize our life with the forces in our environment. Note: SGI is not part of Nichiren Shoshu. SGI was excommunicated in 1991. The Comparison between Buddhist And Non-Buddhist Teachings Nichiren Daishonin established the principle of the five guides for propagation in order to judge the validity of various teachings. These five guides consist of the teaching, the capacity, the time, the country, and the stage of propagation. The first guide is judging the teaching. Utilizing the process of comparison, the specific doctrine of a religion can be examined in terms of its validity. Within the process of judging the teaching, there is a five-level comparison starting from the shallow and progressing to the deep. This doctrine is called the fivefold comparison. It comprises of the comparisons between Buddhist and non-Buddhist teachings (also known as the \u201cinner\u201d and the \u201couter\u201d), the Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist teachings, the true Mahayana and the provisional Mahayana, the essential and the theoretical, and the sowing and the harvest. Relatively, the doctrines of these teachings are clarified in regards to their provisional and true nature, as well as the comparative profundity of their doctrines. This original doctrine taught by the Daishonin, the fivefold comparison is expounded in the \u201cOpening of the Eyes,\u201d in addition to other Goshos, thereby emphasizing its importance. The first level of the fivefold comparison is the relative judgment of the Buddhist and non-Buddhist teachings, which are also referred to as the \u201cinner way\u201d and the \u201couter way.\u201d The inner way refers to Buddhism, and the outer way refers to teachings other than Buddhism, such as Brahmanism, Christianity, Islam, Confucianism and so forth. This principle contrasts and compares Buddhism, specifically, with other religious doctrines. Three Types of Non-Buddhist Teachings The Daishonin stated in his \u201cOutline of the Lifelong Sacred Teachings\u201d (\u201cIchidai shogyo tai\u2019i\u201d): There are three types of the outer way [non-Buddhist teachings]. (Gosho, p. 97) Twenty-sixth High Priest, Nichikan Shonin, discussed the non-Buddhist teachings in his Commentary on the \u201cOpening of the Eyes\u201d (\u201cKaimoku-sho\u201d guki): The three types of non-Buddhist teachings consist of the following: The first type is represented by the non-Buddhist teachings that are outside the realm of Buddhism. The doctrines of the six non-Buddhist teachers are associated with this form of the outer way. The second type is signified by the non-Buddhist teachings of those who are related to Buddhism, but function to denounce it. The third type refers to the non-Buddhist teachings that are doctrinally associated with Buddhism. They are upheld by those who study the doctrines of Buddhism, but promote evil perspectives about them. (Rekizen, p. 5189) As explained above, the first type of non-Buddhist teachings are the religions other than Buddhism. In the Daishonin\u2019s Goshos, Confucianism or Brahmanism are sometimes referred to as the first type of the outer way. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are also included in this category. The second type is called the \u201cBuddhism-related outer way.\u201d It includes non-Buddhist groups who appropriate the teachings of Buddhism into their own religious doctrines, thereby appearing to be a Buddhist denomination. New religions in present day Japan such as Reiyukai, Rissho-Kosei-Kai, Shinyo-en, Agon-shu and so forth, are included in this category. The third type is called the \u201cBuddhism-learned outer way.\u201d It includes those groups who deviated from the correct teachings of Buddhism, and have fundamentally reverted to non-Buddhist views. The Non-Buddhist Teachings Indicated in the Gosho In China, teachings by Confucius, Mencius, and Lao Tzu, are broadly embraced and revered. In his \u201cOpening of the Eyes,\u201d the Daishonin stated with regard to these outer ways: To sum it up, their ultimate doctrines are limited to the three profundities. The first is the profundity of being, established by the Duke of Chou, and others. The second is the profundity of non-being, expounded by Lao Tzu, and others. The third is the profundity of both being and non-being asserted by Chuang Tzu. (Gosho, p. 524; cf. MW-2, p. 73) (Note: This chapter can be read in its entirety in the book: The Doctrines and Practice of Nichiren Shoshu. For more information, please contact your local temple.) ",

Not until Martin Luther did humanity attempt to have an individual relationship with the teaching. To this day all other religions teach of an external force to face universal suffering. ",

            "answer_text": " The main difference between Buddhism and theistic religions is that in Buddhism there is no such concept of a \u201ccreator\u201d, of a \u201cgod\u201d, of an external force. The Buddha was a human being, just like any other, who experimented with the mind until he found a way to get rid of all mental afflictions and develop all good qualities. Buddhism, in a nutshell, states that any human being on this planet can acheive the same result if they walk in the footsteps of the Buddha - if they do the exact same things as the Buddha did and put into practice his findings. Buddhism is quite scientific and a great analogy in this sense that is often made by Venerable Robina Courtin is that of Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. When Einstein came up with his theory, he proved it step by step, in a very logical and rational manner. Scientists could not simply \u201cbelieve\u201d in relativity because Einstein said they should, they had to practically follow the same steps as Einstein and get the same result in order to agree that it is a valid theory. Similarily, in Buddhism, there is no such concept of \u201cblind faith\u201d, but rather of proving right the Buddha\u2019s experiece by doing the exact same practices as he did. Another big difference is that in Buddhism there is no such concept of a \u201cseparate self\u201d or an \u201cindividual soul\u201d (as you would find in Hinduism, or Christianity, for instance). This concept is replaced with the concept of \u201cinterbeing\u201d - we exist together according to the laws of cause and effect. This is because that is - there is no separation between phenomena. As Thich Nhat Hanh beautifully puts it - the ocean manifests itself in different waves, some bigger, some smaller, some faster, some slower - but all waves are made of water and are part of the same movement, of the same ocean. He defines the concept of englightenment as being that moment when a wave realizes it is the ocean. Also, in Buddhism, there are no such concepts of \u201cbeginning\u201d and \u201cend\u201d, but rather the concept of a \u201cvast continuum\u201d. There is no first moment of creation, nor a final moment of destruction, there is no birth and no death. All that exists is a cyclical manifestation. For example, when the Dalai Lama was asked about The Big Bang, he said: \u201cBig Bang? Yes, no problem, just not the first Big Bang.\u201d So, according to this theory, everything that exists comes from a previous moment of itself, including our own minds. We cannot be created, nor destroyed and we are but a mere endless continuation. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the Difference between Buddhism and Vedic Dharmas of India & Organized religions? Buddhism is a theory and Buddha never propagated it and least as a religion. He was Sanatan Dharma Follower but he only preached a new view to people to exhort them to not go for useless wars. Thats it. His agenda was not what is considered as a religion. Most Buddhist followers who accepted in those times did out of personal conviction and yet it was not really an organized religion in any respect. Those who followed him do it as a real personal conduct exercise and it does work for them. It is however million times simpler and smarter theory than all 3 Abrahmic organized religions that binds customer to small letters agreement that usually is binding, and in one case it is once in you cant get out kind of coercion. Henceforth Buddhism as a code of conduct for individuals, akin and closest to Sanatan Dharma, Zoroastrianism and Vedic thoughts Vedic thoughts as expounded in various Upanishads there are 10 principles that are like rules or truths and Buddhist idea has Four of them as four Truths expressing the basic orientation of Buddhism: we desire and cling to impermanent states and things, which is dukha, \"incapable of satisfying\" and painful. The terms used in Buddhist texts are in Pali language which is a Prakrit language - [Prakrit are natural languages that derivate from Classical Sanskrit] a popular language of about 2600 years ago in North East India. This keeps us caught in Sansara, the endless cycle of repeated rebirth, dukha [incessant pain] and dying again.But there is a way to liberation from this endless cycle to the state of nirvana, namely following the Noble Path. Sansara means wandering or \"human world\", with the connotation of cyclic, circuitous change. It refers to the theory of rebirth and \"cyclicality of all life, matter, existence\", a fundamental assumption of Buddhism, as with all major Indian religions! The concept of rebirths and realms in which these rebirths can occur, is literally the same in Buddhism as in Vedic thought, in particular Tibetan Buddhism with its wheel of existence (Bhavacakra) doctrine. [BhavChakra the wheel of sensory life]. Liberation from this cycle of existence, Nirvana, has been the foundation and the key historical justification of Buddhism. Hinduism and all its variations have the same goal. The truth of dukha is the basic insight that life in this mundane world, with its clinging and craving to impermanent states and things is sorrowful and unsatisfactory. Dukha can be translated as perhaps not as pain but \"incapable of satisfying,the unsatisfactory nature and the general insecurity of all conditioned phenomena\"; or perpetual suffering. Theorists like to say its not suffering but ultimately unsatisfactory nature of temporary states, including pleasant but temporary experiences. We expect happiness from states which are impermanent, and therefore cannot attain real happiness. The key difference between Buddhism and Hinduism is the idea of Spirit or Soul.? Rebirth of soul refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of sentient life, each running from conception to death. As per Buddhist thought, this rebirth does not involve any soul, because of its doctrine of anatta (Sanskrit: anatman, no self) which rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging, eternal soul, as it is called in Hinduism and Christianity. This obviously is merely a theory that was propagated out of a few of his discourses but without a sentient soul the entire idea of rebirth has no basis. The later writers of Buddhist texts deliberately created concepts as a different \"religion\" than existing forms of Dharma to keep it distinguished or unique. Real original Sanatana Dharma is perhaps the oldest living concept of connecting with the spirit and it does consider Soul as a sentient self or rather a living entity that does not ever die, perish or can not be assassinated as you can a physical form. Soul, as per Vedic and Post Vedic thoughts and of course as per all greatest Rshis and sages of ancient human world - concluded that the Atma is a fragment of Highest energy that transcends life forms, realms and it can rebirth, reform, re-incarnate and continue in a dimension or realm as per volition but more guided by its own Karmic life of past. The majority of Buddhist traditions, assert that vijnana [Sanskrit Vigyan or consciousness in context of Pali) though evolving, exists as a continuum and that is exactly same as Vedic thought confirming that Chaitnya Consciousness] is not only sentient, evolving and a continuum but it can also liberate from the cycle of rebirths with self improvement of conduct. In Buddhism, Karma (Sanskrit: \"acts\") drives Sansara, the endless cycle of suffering and rebirth for each being. Good, skilful deeds (Pali: \"kusala\" Sanskrit Kushal) and bad, unskilful deeds (Pali: \"akusala\" Sanskrit Akushal) produce seeds in the unconscious house (Alaya) that mature later either in this life or in a subsequent rebirth. The existence of Karma is a core belief in Buddhism, as with all Indian religions. Simply speaking whatever you sow you will reap. If you invest in Freedom, good deeds & thoughts you get good results and if you invest in spreading fear, control & bad deeds your results will be quite bad. It is all within our reach and not subject to any God. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether or not you want to consider Buddhism \u2014 and Zen in particular \u2014 as a religion depends on how you define and describe religion. That said, and particularly in contrast to Abrahamic faiths, The Buddha explained that his mission was to teach about dukkha (more or less dissatisfaction, suffering, the human condition) and release from dukka.God and belief in God or gods is irrelevant, and dogma is unimportant.This is no \u201cself,\u201d and thus no \u201csoul\u201d to be saved.Various cultural and religious/mythological trappings have become part of Buddhism \u2014 as practiced \u2014 in many different nations, but they are not important either with respect to the core teaching (called the dharma).Although Buddhists tend to be \u201cnice\u201d people, like the Dalai Lama, it is not owing to some deal about being \u201cnice\u201d and going to heaven, or being \u201cbad\u201d and going to hell.Buddhism includes, and perhaps embraces paradox, especially in Zen. So is there an after life? A typical answer is: in a sense we continue, in a sense we don\u2019t. But keep in mind that those sort of questions are not really helpful in release from dukkha.",

            "answer_text": "Yeah your question is important. Buddhism he is completely scientific religion and completely based on virtuality. Othar religions are believes in some kind of beliefs and etc. But Buddhism is completely scientific , how ?. Buddhism is based on principles of experience & perception instead of accepting something directly. Buddhism is virtual religion based on law of nature. If you know the meaning of DHAMMA , the meaning of dhamma is nothing but to leave accordingly law of nature. No plasticity , no artificially , live as natural flow. Secondly impressing thing of Buddhism is, in Buddhism religion there is nothing like to pray individual person. That's why our people was not able to understand Buddha , because Buddha was concentrating on consciousness and meditation not praying the God , temples , prayers etc. From last words - Buddha says \u201c if I will be come back on earth , I will be MAITREYA\u201d. & Amazing thing is , Meaning of MAITREYA is nothing but FRIEND.

            "answer_text": "I will be ignoring all the woo-woo talk, for none of that is empirical or communicable. Look at what we know of Gautama's society, multiple movements in play in contrasting themselves from the mainstream Dharma of the day, what continues today misnamed as Hinduism. Mahavira, Gosala etc. Gautama was one among many. But he hit the lottery of royal patronage. In any case, in context of practice, Sanatana was contextual, its pursuit of the essential/ultimate in life/about life was different for different stages in life. So the Shrama - austerities of the path was only for Yatis, Yogis of the vanaprastha or sanyasa ashramas. The pursuit of artha/kama - wealth/desire was to be managed in an ethical contextJains - well everybody was into Shramas - fasting and austeritys - even little girls, per latest news.Buddha - said nobody need to indulge in such austerities., but neither should there be any desire - nihil.Then there were the fatalists/materialists - where everyone should pursue material success and what is apparent is the only truthSeen in this context, Sanataana is a superset of custom options, other dharmic traditions including Buddhism were subset of specialised options. But again, this is just one context. As to contrast against Abrahamic religions, all the Dharmic traditions are experiential, so rarely have any dogma. But Abrahamic creeds are \u201crevelations\u201d, so XYZ said so in such and such book, so everyone got to unquestioningly believe in that book. It is not enough you believe so, but also should go around and bother other people to believe. Using tools ranging from violence to charity. ",

Along with this, Buddhism discourages all metaphysical questions and answers such as: Is there a God? Did the world have a beginning or an end? Do we reincarnate? Rather, we sit and face life as it is right now, eliminate suffering and the sources of suffering in our body and mind right now, and live a life of love and generosity. In short, beliefs and ideas about God or the world don\u2019t matter. What we do with our lives, that matters a lot. ",

Budhism was developed when brahmanism had a stronghold in indian subcontinent. Brahmanism was known for its varna system and other class restrictions with rituals and rules. On the other hand, jainism also grew in this period which was characterisized by completely classless society, no ultimate god in the heaven theory and complete non violence and non vegeteranism. So the budhism was the middle path to these two school of thoughts. It propagated the virtues of compassion towards every living being and the ultimate purpose of life as attaining \u201cnirvana\u201d thereby releasing oneself from the cycle of birth and death. Thus budhism is the middle path between asceticism and hedonism. ",
