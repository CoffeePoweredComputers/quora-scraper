            "answer_text": "The Siege of Baghdad lasted 13 days. When they first appeared at the border, the Caliph was confident that he could easily defeat them. He did not call for aid from the other parts of his caliphate. He did not raise a larger army from the immediate vicinity of Baghdad. Only 20 days later, the Mongols were at the gates of Baghdad, and it fell 13 days later. There was in fact no time. The rest of the Muslim world did not have enough time to raise armies, and fly them to Baghdad. Their tanks, APCs, and artillery pieces couldn\u2019t fit on the limited number of transport aircraft they had. That number being 0. Even if there had been enough time, they didn\u2019t do so, because they concentrated on shoring up their own defences to prepare for the Mongol horde to reach them. But they had a perfectly good excuse. Baghdad fell too quickly to be helped. ",

            "answer_text": "The caliph did not take the threat seriously. The Muslim world was as divided as it is now. Many muslim leaders thought the Christians were more of a threat; the Sultan had already made a deal with the khakhan; the mamelukes in Egypt were in the middle of a power struggle. In any case, it might not have made much difference. Hulagu's army numbered 150,000 men (note this is a bigger army than the one we sent into Iraq), superbly equipped and with the most advanced siege engines available. The mamelukes were only able to defeat the mongols when most of that army had gone back to mongolia to elect a new khakhan. ",
