            "answer_text": "Stalin was jubilant, Churchill was concerned it would lengthen the war. The policy of unconditional surrender had many detractors among allied political and military leaders all with the same concerns of galvanizing enemy resistance and lengthening the war. This was FDR\u2019s idea and he did not discuss it with anyone else before announcing it. It remains controversial to this day. For myself I see the value. Both Japan and Germany were outlaw states led by fanatics who had no concern for the rights of others and who were willing to sacrifice their own people to further their criminal ambitions. By insisting they submit to the will of the allies they stood completely discredited and defeated in the eyes of the world and hopefully their own people. In Germany\u2019s case it should be obvious the loss was the result of following Hitler and not the result of betrayal from within. Both nations lay in ruins because of the actions of their leaders they so blindly followed. There was to be no wartime leaders coming back later to quietly lead their nation into another war. When FDR tossed \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d on the table, Churchill was stunned. He and the president had bandied about various ideas for ending the war, but as far as Churchill knew, nothing had been decided. The prime minister later confessed to Eden that he had no desire to fuse the enemy into a solid, desperate block. In his opinion, any crack in Axis unity \u201cwould be all to the good.\u201d But he choked back his reservations, and unconditional surrender became the Allied prerequisite for peace. Stalin recognized unconditional surrender as an opportunity. The war was beginning to wind down, and he was eager to expand his influence over postwar Germany. His means to this end was a group of German communists living in exile in Russia, and German prisoners of war calling themselves the Free Germany Committee. They wanted an overthrow of Hitler, the cessation of military operations, and peace negotiations, preferably with a pro-Soviet slant. Ironically, the formula of unconditional surrender was destined to become an enormous impediment to finding peace, and exacted a very heavy price. Across the spectrum of combatants it unleashed a range of responses. Within Germany, Goebbels was jubilant, claiming he could never have dreamt up a more effective strategy to persuade the doomed Germans to fight to the last breath. Canaris, fatalistic as always, could see no solution whatsoever. Kleist-Schmenzin was vitriolic: Both Hitler and Roosevelt should have their own personal vats in which to boil in hell. Unconditional Surrender: Questioning FDR's Prerequisite for Peace - The History Reader On the final day of the Conference, President Roosevelt announced that he and Churchill had decided that the only way to ensure postwar peace was to adopt a policy of unconditional surrender. The President clearly stated, however, that the policy of unconditional surrender did not entail the destruction of the populations of the Axis powers but rather, \u201cthe destruction of the philosophies in those countries which are based on conquest and the subjugation of other people.\u201d Milestones: 1937-1945 An end of the war was desired. Japan\u2019s primary (and substantially only) concern was with the continued insistence by the Americans of the idea of \u201cunconditional surrender.\u201d To Japan, this meant risking the life and government of the Emperor \u2013 a possibility that was beyond consideration. Japan seemed quite prepared for a complete surrender of all military activity and assets, but as the Emperor was in a manner considered a \u201cgod\u201d, the idea of his embarrassment and dethroning \u2013 let alone the risk of standing for war crimes \u2013 was unthinkable.

            "answer_text": "Churchill had a magnanimous streak that alway believed in goodwill to the vanquished. He also believed that announcing a policy of Unconditional Surrender would motivate greater resistance on the part of the Germans. Stalin may have agreed - though he had no reason to want the Nazi regime to survive. The US was not having any of this. There was some background to the US focus on Unconditional Surrender. In WW1 the Americans had argued for a similar approach. In part, some military leaders wanted more opportunity to win glory in battle, but there was a more level headed reason endorsed by many US leaders. It was felt that Germany must be made to understand that they had been beaten and beaten decisively. Absent that recognition on the part not just of German leaders by German society at large, then the peace would only be temporary. In the end, these attitudes proved to be prophetic. They reflect Marshal Foch\u2019s appreciation of the Treaty of Versailles: \u201cThis is not a peace; this is an armistice for 20 years.\u201d The British historian, AJP Taylor, stated his belief that the Germans knew they were beaten, but knew that they had the strength to prolong the war at least another year. But they believed that this would mean an enlightened peace dictated by an all powerful America in 1919 - and that would be disastrous to German elites, especially the military. In truth, the British and French were not keen on this either. They had fought a long and bloody war since 1914 and the thought of the Johnny come lately Americans dictating a peace was not very congenial to them as well. There was also the political angle. Britain and France were democracies. How would the population view another year of bitter and bloody war when they learned that they could have had peace in 1918? Shortsighted perhaps as an enlightened peace in 1919 might have prevented the catastrophe of WW2, but understandable if you put yourself in their shoes at the time. In WW2, the US was not having any compromise with Germany or Japan. They would be defeated and they would admit defeat unconditionally. The history of the last 77 years has shown the wisdom of this decision. ",
