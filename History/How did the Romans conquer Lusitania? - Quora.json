            "answer_text": "The Carthaginians colonized Spain in the late 200s BCE and attempted to conquer the Lusitanians, but were beaten back, and the colonies were ceded to the Romans in the aftermath of the Second Punic War. Conflicts with the fragmented Lusitanian tribes began as early as 194 BCE when the Lusitanians were an autonomous people under the Roman yoke. However, the first major war occured in 155 BCE. A tribal leader named Punicus led the insurrection against Roman rule. He and his successors waged a fairly successful campaign against various Roman generals over the course of fifteen years. In 139 BCE, Viriathus (the new tribal leader) was assassinated by three of his retainers, who were offered cash by a Roman consul. After the deed was done, they went to the consul, who had them executed instead, stating \u201cRome does not pay traitors.\u201d The disunited tribes continued to put up resistance for decades after the incident, but they were slowly Romanized. They adopted Latin and Roman customs, and they were eventually made citizens of the Empire. ",
