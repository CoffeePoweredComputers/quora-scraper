            "answer_text": "the Mongols didn\u2019t conquered Islam rather Islam conquered a good part of the Mongol world. the old adage is generally true, you can\u2019t beat something with nothing. the Mongols had nothing to offer the people they made war against but death or subjugation. the Mongols were a totally predatory and parasitic group. Islam was widespread in the areas the Mongols invaded long before they arrived. the Mongols didn\u2019t offer a competing worldview or system of belief. they weren\u2019t interested in religion only in conquest and loot. Mongol native \u201cculture\u201d was weak. after a short time they couldn\u2019t even hold onto their language or religion adopting those of the losers they had defeated. ironic isn\u2019t it? ",

They got Muslim areas of Central Asia, along with Persia, Mesopotamia, and the Middle East, but they couldn\u2019t really get past the mountains of Central Asia to get into the Muslim areas of India, they weren\u2019t able to get most of Anatolia (chunks of which were Muslim), and the Egyptians stopped them from getting into Africa and Iberia. What they did conquer, they conquered the way they did everything else. Their main troops were mobile and highly skilled mounted archers who could use hit-and-run tactics on any troops sent into the field against them. They were deployed skillfully and in overwhelming numbers. Where fortifications stood in their way, they could call on engineers from subject territories to help them knock down walls. And they had a fearsome reputation which led some people to surrender to avoid utter destruction. ",

It says they just wanted to cross (Islamic) Persia respectfully and reach the other side to proceed with their conquest to reach the end of the world. But when their messengers were killed by Persians and Gingiz Khan gifts were confiscated by the district ruler undermining them as barbarous tyrant tribes, they rushed and swept away Persia and Islamic Imperialism as a bonus- most wanted to repeat itself.

So, they could have amazing speed which the enemy couldn't even think of and never planned on. Besides , mongols had composite bow which was easy to carry &could shoot fast. They also had skill of shooting while galloping. When Mongols were seen to coming from one way, the next moment they are going in another way. They started the attack and they finished it, fast. So, the enemy was easily confused and fooled. ",
