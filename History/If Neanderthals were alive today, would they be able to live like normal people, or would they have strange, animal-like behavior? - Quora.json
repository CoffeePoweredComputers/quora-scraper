            "answer_text": "On June 1 last year, (according to Quora), I answered the question: If a Neanderthal was brought back to life today would they be able to adapt to modern society?\u201d As your query is remarkably similar, I make no apologies for pasting that response here unabridged. This is it: \u201cOn a personal level, I really would be ecstatic if Neanderthals were somehow transported to our modern era. Furthermore, not only would they fully adapt to our society, but they quite possibly could become very wealthy indeed. In addition, and for the simple reason that I would be their agent, I would become very rich as well. My commission would be somewhere up there in the stratosphere. Their artworks would sell for millions...perhaps billions of dollars. Just look at what they had achieved in the past and with primitive materials.\u201d     To conclude, I would argue that the foregoing is not exactly something which could be described as animal behavior. And finally, I would point out that the Neanderthals had bigger brains than us. Therefore, every new Neanderthal birth might well be immediately registered for an eventual place at MIT, or Harvard or Oxford Universities. ",

            "answer_text": "Human taxonomy is not the only way to look at human behavior. The generic human is millions of years old as a family tree. We all carry common DNA. A new species of humans do not just pop up nor do they suddenly die. Humans are a product of the Cline Effect. Neanderthals were one unique breed that lived at a specific time in a specific place. They were replaced by a newer breed of human. The DNA still flows. If the climate changes, the Neanderthal breed may become dominant. There is a Neanderthal dominant breed of people, just as there are other breeds of humans. We have different labels for them. They live as normally as they can with their given physical/mental differences. Consider the strange behavior of different races, breeds, cultures, nations, tribes, and families. Perhaps human-like behavior is the strange behavior and animal behavior is normal. Anthropomorphism has been a normal ailment among modern humans for 20,000 years. ",
