            "answer_text": "The answer you're looking for depends on the expert you ask.  Genetic and genome information are adding pieces to the puzzle, but as of now, 2015, no one can offer a definitive answer. The best guesses are that the people living in Japan have had visiting groups arrive at various times from various places, and these visitors intermarried and mixed in with the locals. The first group was probably some sort of Ainu or proto-Ainu group that came down from Siberia and Kamchatka.  No one knows if they were here first or if they mixed with an even more aboriginal J group.  But some time 3 or more centuries before the Common Era, Mongols probably arrived in northern Honshu, possibly Hokkaido, and moved south.  About the same time, or maybe slightly sooner, Malay groups arrived on the opposite end of the archipelago and moved north and east. After that, the history of Korea and China comes into play.  Japan was a relatively safe place to escape from invasions and counter-invasions on the mainland.  Some time between about 230 BC and 300 AD, waves of East Asians escaped wars on the mainland, bringing new technologies and new genetics to Japan.  We talk about the Japanese living in Japan before 250 BC or so as J\u014dmon (\"rope pattern\") tribes after their distinctive pottery patterns.  The East Asians are called Yayoi groups after archeological evidence first unearthed in the Yayoi section of Tokyo.  The mix of these two groups give us modern Japanese features, and 21st century J still use J\u014dmon and Yayoi to describe facial features here. ",

Modern Japanese people are not ethnicity, they are nationality. Modern Japanese people are mixture of Koreans, Chinese, Ryukyu Kingdom people (Okinawa), Ainu people, and many other groups of people, including surrounding near by pacific islands.    ",
