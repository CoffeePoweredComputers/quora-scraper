            "answer_text": "Germany had a chance on both war to win the game but at first, what was the game? Forget Germany wanted to rule the entire world . Even Hitler the madman, didn\u2019t think a second to invade the US or to send Panzer at Beijing . Armchair general delirium only. On the first world war Germany had \u201climited goals\u201d which means to take control of Belgium, a nice part of France especially the North and East area in order to break the backbone of French industrial .To get free access on open ocean ,a few colonies more ( Morocco, Ivory coast for examples) .on the Eastern side , the remaining of Poland ( Poland was split between Russia and Germany before war ) , baltics states, and a slice of Ukraine. Just limited goals\u2026 Curiously the german second world war goals are more in the dark . Except to get all german speaking germans under their flag and the destruction of judeo bolchevism . Not really to get back some African colonies as the Nazis thought that their future colonial domain was to be former Russia. Of course free access on Ocean and Mediteranean sea. France should be either dismenbered or put in a heavy vassalage, Yugoslavia torn apart , Poland erased from memories and some little kindness like to see around 30/50 millions slavs to \u201cdisappear\u201d in the East in order to get some place for the new colonial german landlords. Russia a german colony to the Urals( included?) In both case Germany hope to get a friendly or allied UK within years .Neither the Kaiser, nor the Nazis brutes wanted to annex UK except if forced to do so. At which moment Germany should have a chance. On the First war. In 1914 and the initial battle in France. the french victory on the fisrt battle of the Marne . First Battle of the Marne - Wikipedia. France should continue the war.Without the French armies and Russia alone ,no doubt an agreement should have been found with UK In first part of 1918 after Russia collapsed in revolutionnary turmoil .For the fist time of the war the german could send nearly all their forces on the west front in order to crush for once France and force Britain and US to withdraw . After initial sucess they failed. Spring Offensive - Wikipedia. As Germany had nearly sent it last forces but failed the Allies began their Hundred Days Offensive - Wikipedia which finally caused the 11th November armistice and end of the first war. Actually the German had won their war objectives on the eastern part Treaty of Brest-Litovsk - Wikipedia but hoped to gain the whole match as their high command understood that with the combined strengh of the British empire, France and the incoming US they couldn\u2019t win the game on the end. They played , they lost. For second world war I think that Nazi Germany had two chances . The biggest one in June/July 1940 and Dunkirk. France was defeated ,the US fixed in neutrality UK defeated and her army saved by miracle ( Churchill about Dunkirk : We don\u2019t win war with evacuation\u2026 ) If Dunkirk be a bloodbath for the british army as it should have been , it is highly possible that Churchill be dismissed and lord Halifax called. Halifax would have ask the peace conditions from Germany .If the germans weren\u2019t too greedy the deal would have been done. With UK out of the game for at least two years or more. US even if attacked by Japan , wouldn\u2019 t have been at war with Germany ( unless the German got completly nuts ) .Without the UK island unsinkable aircraft carrier the US were in troubles . Second thing if UK out of order for a while and US intervention very very unlikely. Germany can gather all her forces against Soviet Union without the oil problems and bombing issues. Germany may slow down Submarine production and Flak gun production to produce more tanks . So Soviet Union totally alone will face a hard time in 1941 /1942. Not sure at all that the Soviet would prevail . Result in 1943 Soviet union having lost Moscow , Leningrad and Stalingrad and then caucasus oil sue for peace. Uk and US spectators congratulate nazis Germany for having destroyed bolchevism \u2026 Germany had also a small chance to win second world war, if instead of the tremendous encirclement of Russian forces in Kiev\u2019s pocket( august /september 1941) they should have gone to Moscow . The lost of Moscow in late October/November 41 may have been a death blow to the Soviet. Possible but not sure as the first question , in this case , would have been , did the Germans had enough force to conquer Moscow (even if the city is encircled) , if the City itself is defended. Street fighting was very costly\u2026 Actually on the whole germany had a better chance to win in the first world war as it \u201c only\u201d have to defeat France in a decisive way to find out an agreement with UK. US at that moment wasn\u2019t a key actor. For the second world war Germany main goal was the destruction of Judeo Bolchevism and the creation of a great eastern empire. Thus fighting with the soviet union was irreversible. Read mein Kampf if you have any doubt. Don\u2019t forget that Hitler hoped that UK join his point of view and ally with him against communism . He despised the US but admire UK. For the nazis England was a potential brother in arm . the war declaration in 3rd of September 1939 was a very bad surprise and later the stubbornness of Churchill one of his nightmare. To win a war is not only a military problem it is mainly a political one. ",

            "answer_text": "That really depends on what you count as Winning. Firstly World War One was a War of Alliances - not of agression, at least not between the prominent powers. The Emperor of Austria, Franz Joseph, declared war on Serbia, despite no other country in the world thinking it was a good idea - because everyone knew that it would light the tinderbox that was Europe, and over night everyone got dragged into what would become World War One, a war no one in Europe wanted - hell Wilhem the Second wrote the the Emperor of Russia, his cousin who he referred to as \u2018Nicky\u2019, essentailly saying that he would do all he could to get the Austrians to accept the terms Serbia had offered\u2026 Now this is important. Because the peace treaty that would have come if the Central Powers had won in Europe?? Would have been far less severe than you might expect. Germany would have taken a few colonies for Pride reasons, took minor territitoes in Europe, weakend France for a few decades and thats about it. To be honest Geramny was far more worried about the threat Russia posed - they knew full well that once Russia caught up technolgically, had industrilised and built up their infrustructure, that Russia could steamroll Germany.. Which is why the Treat of Brest-Livostk, the Russo-German Peace Treaty was so much harsher then what most agree Germany would have forced upon the rest of the Entente (Allied) powers / assosisated poiwers. Now if they had taken France, then the Entetente powers would have likely come to the table and conceded to German demand, if there were realtivly minor like most expect, Germany would have technically won. However if those demands were severe, than no. Germany and the Central Powers had no chance in hell of fighting a prolonged war. By 1918 the Central Powers were on the brink of starvation, their economies had all but compelltly collapsed and praitcally the entire world was alligned againts them\u2026 The green in the image below shows just how much of the world was directly alligned, or at least an assoiate power helping to some extent, the Allies Cause\u2026  So Really it depends. Would German demands to the rest of the world be realtivily small if they did suceeded in their final 1918 push?? Then yes, they had a much greater chance of winning the war then Germany ever did in WW2\u2026 However if those demands were to harsh?? Then no - Germany had a greater chance of winning WW2\u2026 Most peopel forget that by 1941 Hitler had all but won the World War\u2026 If he had simply broke his allianace with Japan when they attacked Pearl Harbour (And he had broken alliances and pacts several times before that), and if he had not declared war on the Soviet Union when they were on realitvily good terms before that, then Hitler had already won what would have been known as World War Two. I mean you can look at how much terreitory was either occupied or Allied to Germany in WW2 in the map below\u2026  ",
