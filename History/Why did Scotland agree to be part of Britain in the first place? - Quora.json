            "answer_text": "Hi I felt Ed Robertson gave an excellent answer. However, I would enjoy putting my own slant on the situation. Scotland\u2019s history stretches back into the mists of time, but It was King Kenneth and his descendants who guided Scotland, that is until King James VI, who while a noble person of his beliefs, that he wished to have a \u2018Union of Equals\u2019 it is well noted the English Nobles of London guffawed at this barbarian\u2019s attempt to fop it up with their civilized selfs. Henry VIII\u2019s decision to divide Christendom for personal gain; his descendants went around killing Catholics. The East India Trading Company brought in (the equivalent) of millions?billions? in taxes which pleased the King giving the English favor and the Scottish Nobles had taken note of and wanted for themselves. They hatched a scheme called the Darien Scheme, which was all but sabotaged by the then King, who likely couldn\u2019t be bothered with two sets of nobles and two parliaments to bribe. Besides.. Scotland was for the vast majority still Catholic. Which brings us to the OA\u2019s question. The Scottish Nobles in a desire to gain wealth and favor from a King who most likely hated them, foolishly or greedily committed to the Darien Scheme. This was the perfect opportunity of said King to remove Scotland and ensure English power. He sent his spy Black Thumb along with the ship destined for Panama, his soldiers, the ones that had killed the McDonalds at Glencoe. It would have been easy for Black Thumb to poison the well with any unclean thing. So the Scottish Nobles were broke.. the English bribed them with lands and money. The English feared they would not be able to claim their prize, so they passed the Alien Act of 1705, a heinous hideous piece of legislature .. worthy only of a place of purest evil, like the 7th circle of hell or Westminster; The Throne of Filth Lies and Pedophiles. The English begun a trading embargo on Scotland, choices are; join us or starve to death. \u2018Embargo\u2019 in this case is just a fancy word for surround us until we give in or die. The French tried unsuccessfully to get food and provisions to us but the might of the English navy was too much for them. The Scottish nobles broke.. but not unanimously, as is we are Scottish, our Scottish fortitude had held us in good stead.. but it wasn\u2019t enough to stop the greed of the Scottish Nobles. Eventually the bribes came and were accepted. The Scottish people of course were outraged. Rioting on the streets of Edinburgh and Glasgow, lynch mobs trying to find the nobles that had sold Scotland and to kill them. The English continued the Alien Act to break the Scottish French alliance past 1707, forcing Scottish traders to accept English goods, which must have looked to them.. covered the blood of the ancestors. Scotland .. I think it is obvious.. did NOT join the Kingdom voluntarily. The outcome of votes despite the evil done to us, was 110 in favor to 69 against. And I know everyone of those 69 have a better chance to be in heaven than those 110. Why? because we are Scottish.. we would have understood. Different day, same English nonsense.. trying to starve us to death. We would have got through it, like we always do, and if some died, they died on their feet and no their knees. I could comment on the Highland Potato Famine, the Highland Clearances and Scotland\u2019s inability to get ourselves out of this mess due to a low population combined with vast emigration of Scots people fleeing the Imperialist English.. that it is only now we have a chance at freedom of English rule, in 2014 we had a referendum.. in which \u2018better together\u2019 told many lies; it was still close 55% NO to 45% YES.. showing Scots still have that great spark of resilience and determination that God put in us as a peoples. An\u2019 any o\u2019er Scotsfolk a\u2019naw thyt huv an\u2019oer ethnicity, yuv passed yon burn in test t\u00e6, wan o\u2019 uys. ",

            "answer_text": "Scotland was conquered by and incorporated into the English state, which then took the name \u201cUnited Kingdom\u201d, in three stages, between 1603 and 1746. This was a process that had been nearly 900 years in the making. Both England and Scotland came into existence as unified countries around the same time, the middle of the 9th century CE. England was larger and more powerful, and invaded Scotland and attempted to conquer it with monotonous regularity for century after century. At the turn of the 13th into the 14th centuries, England conquered and occupied Scotland for several decades. The English state was persuaded to withdraw its occupation forces on receipt of Scotland\u2019s payment of a punitive ransom of around \u00a380 billion in today\u2019s money. Scotland remained independent for another nearly 300 years, thanks to the support of its powerful ally, France. Then in the second half of the 16th century, the presence in the Scottish court of Protestant fanatics and agents of the English state led to Mary Queen of Scots being deposed from the throne, the probably targetted assassination of at least two of her consorts, in order to prevent further heirs, and the kidnapping of her one-year-old son James, who was then put on the Scottish throne surrounded by Protestant fanatic minders and agents of the English state. The Queen of England, Elizabeth eventually dies in 1603, and James, next in line, becomes king of both England and Scotland (and England\u2019s existing colonies, Ireland and Wales). 1\u20130. England and Scotland still have separate (unelected) parliaments representing their landed gentry, merchants, and an embryonic capitalist class. From 1650 onwards, the English Parliament passes a number of pieces of legislation known as the Navigation Acts, aimed at disrupting free international trade, and essentially legalising state piracy by England. A further piece of legislation, the Aliens Acts, prevents Scottish merchants from operating in England. A wrong-headed scheme by Scottish merchants, including leading members of the (unelected) Scottish Parliament, to thwart the English effective maritime monopoly in central America fails, resulting in leading bourgeois figures in Scottish society losing some of their personal wealth. Along come English secret agents with (quite literally) suitcases of money (still a method beloved by today\u2019s CIA), and lo and behold, in 1706 the (unelected) Scottish Parliament votes for union with England to be implemented the following year. The ordinary people of Scotland riot for months, unsuccessfully. The English army is massed on the border anyway, in case their bribed puppets are overthrown. 2\u20130. Scottish society is hopelessly divided by religion, but a section of Scottish society puts their faith in the deposed Stuart, or Jacobite, royal line, and in 1745, a serious attempt was made by Jacobite supporters to overthrow the Hanoverian regime. This is initially successful, but the Jacobite supply lines are over-extended by royal ambition to reconquer the English throne as well as Scotland. The Jacobite rising fails in 1746, and this time Scotland is militarily conquered and occupied. 3\u20130. Two hundred years pass, and then some, and Scotland starts to wake up again \u2026 ",
