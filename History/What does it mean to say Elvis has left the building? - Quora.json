            "answer_text": "The minute E finished his final note\u2014the last song he ever performed was \u201cI Can\u2019t Help Falling in Love with You,\u201d in Indianapolis, on June 26th, 1977,\u2014he burned rubber off the stage and into a waiting limousine. The band would still be finishing up; the Sweet Inspirations would be rounding off the high \u201cYooooouuuuu,\u201d and he\u2019d be ensconced in the back seat, shades on, Ginger Alden by his side. And as with all of his performances, the MC would announce that \u201cElvis has left the building,\u201d to ward off his legions of bloodthirsty fans, already driven into a frenzy by the taste of his sweat and tears when he removed scarves from his neck and flicked them at the screeching maenads. This sentence took on horrible significance when the great man left our crummy building for good in 1977, and headed straight to Heaven, glory glory, hallelujah. ",

Hendrix is gone, but we, his children, are a legion. No show is ever truly over - the stage is still there to fill. Think of similar metaphors. ",
