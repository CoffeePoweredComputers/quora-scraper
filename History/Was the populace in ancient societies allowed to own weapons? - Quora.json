            "answer_text": "Allowed? They were legally required to own, and be proficient in the use of, weapons. As the 1285 Statute of Winchester ruled:- It is likewise commanded that every man have in his house arms for keeping the peace in accordance with the ancient assize; namely that every man between fifteen years and sixty be assessed and sworn to arms according to the amount of his lands and, of his chattels; that is to say, for fifteen pounds of land, and, forty marks worth of chattels, a hauberk, a helmet of iron, a sword, a knife and a horse;for ten pounds worth of land and, twenty marks worth of chattels, a haubergeon, a helmet, a sword and a knife;for a hundred shillings worth of land, a doublet, a helmet of iron, a sword and a knife;for forty shillings worth of land and over, up to a hundred shillings worth, a sword, a bow, arrows and a knife;and he who has less than forty shillings worth of land shall be sworn to have scythes. gisarrnes, knives and other small weapons;he who has less than twenty marks in chattels, swords, knives and other small weapons.And all others who can do so shall have bows and arrows outside the forests and within them bows and bolts.And that the view of arms be made twice a year. And in each hundred and liberty let two constables be chosen to make the view of arms and the aforesaid constables shall, when the justices assigned to this come to the district, present before them the defaults they have found in arms (Statute of Winchester 1285) However, this widespread armament helped to give us the Harrying of the North, the Rebellion of 1088, the Anarchy, the Wars of the Barons, the Peasant\u2019s Revolt, the War of the Roses and the English Civil War: whereas after the Restoration, the requirement for all folk to own arms was greatly relaxed, and we stopped having serious bouts of internal bloodshed every generation or two, while going from absolute monarchy to constitutional democracy based on universal suffrage.

            "answer_text": "This is a very hard question to answer because it is so broad. What ancient societies? When? This question encompasses such a huge swathe of human history, the majority of it, that it is virtually impossible to answer. In general, however, yes. Either because there was no central authority that could deny people from arming themselves, or because these authorities did not have an interest in doing so, or because it would have been impossible to enforce any such bans. Certain groups probably would not have had access to arms, such as slaves (although this is not universal either), and bearing arms may have been restricted in certain context (although this does not have to have been imposed by the state, it can also be cultural norms such as \u201cdon\u2019t carry arms in sacred ground\u201d). So, in general, yes, people owned weapons. Its not so much a question of rights as we think of it, let us not apply our modern ideas on people who would not have shared them, but a question of pragmatics most of the time. ",
