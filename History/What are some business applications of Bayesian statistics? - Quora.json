            "answer_text": "It depends what you mean by \u201cbusiness\u201d but looking for gold in a haystack might qualify. The earliest a breakthrough application of Bayesian Statistics that I am aware of was the work of G. F. Bonham-Carter, F. P. Agterberg, and D. F. Wright from the Mineral Resources Division, Geological Survey of Canada published in 1988. The paper entitled \u201cIntegration of Geological Datasets for Gold Exploration in Nova Scotia\u201d The goal of their study was to create a map showing areas favorable for gold mineralization, based on the distribution of 70 known gold occurrences in part of Nova Scotia, Canada. They developed a methodology which integrated multiple spatial data layers of different kinds such bedrock and surficial geological maps, airborne geophysical survey data, geochemistry of lake-sediment samples, and mineral occurrences. A unique conditions map was created that showed all those areas where a unique set of combined overlay conditions occurred. Using the 70 known gold occurrences a posteriori probability was calculated for each of these unique conditions, resulting in a map depicting the probability of gold. The resulting map correlated with the known occurrences but also showed up new areas favorable for gold mineralization. Since their publication the same or similar methodologies have been applied to a wide range of spatial phenomena including wildlife habitats, crime prediction, commercial site selection and real estate valuation. I should stress that Bayesian Statistics can be applied to non-spatial phenomena. I just happen to be interested and aware of these. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow, that's easy! Pretty much anything that you can do with frequentist methods, and some problems that can't be solved with said methods can indeed be solved with Bayesian methods. Anything you want to estimate, predict, etc, is potentially solved \u201cbetter\u201d by Bayesian methods. And probably a lot more. Defining risk is an inherent part of the Bayesian formulation. I would be surprised if it's not used at least somewhat in insurance. Unless I let myself be cynical, then I wouldn't be surprised. If you would like a more specific answer, please ask a more specific question. ",
