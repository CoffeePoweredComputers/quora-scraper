            "answer_text": "This is not a question you can really answer as it makes the erroneous assumption of assuming that there is such a thing as the East when in reality the civilizations of the East are no more closely related to eachother than they are to the civilizations of the West (which is actually a rather loose family of closely related cultures rather than one monolithic society). The nations of North Africa are racially Caucasian, not really that different from Europeans in terms of their appearance actually, and their people have a Semitic culture, yet there are no real cultural similarities between Arab nations and any other societies save for those which are part of the Muslim world. The nations of sub-Saharan Africa tend to be Christian, but that is where the similarities to the West end. Actually, folk religion is still practiced to an extent in these societies and the cultures (there are many rather unique cultures) don\u2019t resemble those of the Old World. The East doesn't really exist because it is based on an unfair comparison between the West (a small but powerful group of nations sharing a common language but still being very distinct in their traditions and customs) against the much larger \u201cEast\u201d which encompasses the entire rest of the human race regardless of the relations between those people.
