            "answer_text": "People in ancient times were well aware of what a coma is. In fact, the Greek word \u03ba\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 (k\u00f4ma), meaning \u201ca deep, unbreakable sleep\u201d is used in the writings of the Hippocratic Corpus, a collection of various early Greek medical writings, the earliest of which date to around the fifth century BC. People in ancient times, then, knew perfectly well that people in comas were not dead and they did not bury them alive. The problem is that most people in ancient times who went into comas probably did not survive in the coma for very long, since most people who enter a state of coma lose their swallow reflex, meaning, even if they had people taking care of them, feeding them, and giving them water to drink, they probably wouldn\u2019t have had the ability to swallow. It takes about three to seven days for dehydration to kill someone, meaning, if a person went into a coma, they were unable to swallow, and they didn\u2019t wake up within seven days at most, they would die of dehydration. People in comas today can normally only survive due to feeding tubes and IVs.  ABOVE: Photograph from this ABC News article of a young woman in a coma. Most coma patients can only survive for more than a week due to modern medicine and feeding tubes. ",
