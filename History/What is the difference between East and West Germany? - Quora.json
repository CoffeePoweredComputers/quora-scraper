            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the 50 years of segregation resulted in a lot of differences between Germans and the people of the GDR. In the GDR, they swapped one party / dictator for another party / dictator. Do not get me wrong, Adolf Nazi was unique and not comparable to anything else. Still, living continously in a dictatorship affects your mind. While in Western Germany people had a social safety net, too, everybody still knows that he has to do something himself to lead the life he wants. In the GDR, on the other hand, where unemployment was forbidden, the people get used to that the state was responsible for everything. Today, the typical former GDR-citizen tries to get as much benefits as he can from the state and is looking hard to see what else he can get. Some West Germans are rather ashamed to take some aid from the state, even if they have the right to do so. Another interessting fact: The GDR was not guilty for the war nor the Holocaust. In their view, only Western Germany was guilty because it continued the evil Nazi capitalist way, while the GDR purified itself by becoming a communist country. That is why they are xenophobic although there are almost no foreigners or muslim at all in the former GDR. They did not learn the lessons from Nazi Germany as West Germans did. Anonther difference: The GDR-citizens thought that the West would be like the TV series they saw on Western TV like \"Love Boat\" (german version \"Das Traumschiff\") or Dallas. Only rich, pretty and happy people everywhere. They expected to be rich, pretty and happy just at the moment the wall came down, too. And because they had saved lots of money they could not spent in the GDR, which could be changed to Deutschmarks at a very favorable rate, they even lived that dream the first years after the unification, buying Western cars and travelling abroad. Just until almost all their factories got closed and a lot of them get unemployed. In the late nineties, I was attending a meeting in Halberstadt in Sachsen-Anhalt, were some colleagues grown up there boasted with their holidays to Egypt, the USA and the Carribean. Me as a kid did not travel abroad, too - just not because we were not allowed to do so, but because my parents were too poor. Every second year a vacation to the North Sea in a holiday apartment was all we could afford. I personally know a lot of people hailing from the GDR who adapted to the Western life style, being confident, intelligent, hardworking and relying on themselves rather than the state. Still: When I look at the news especially hearing about how refugees are treated in Saxony and how the AFD and Pegida-Movement is on the rise in the former GDR, I sometimes doubt that \"Wir sind ein Volk\" (we are one people), the slogan of the GDR civilian rights activists back in 1989. Perhaps we rather have become two people. ",

            "answer_text": "I presume that you're asking about the difference between East and West Germany today, rather than the difference between the democratic Bundesrepublik Deutschland (West Germany) and the communist Deutsche Demokratische Republik (East Germany) during their Cold War partition. Wikipedia offers at rather thorough summary of that Cold War history [History of Germany (1945\u201390)]. The difference between the East and the West can still be felt in Germany today. The East did not participate in the post-WWII economic boom that the West had. So while we think of Germany as an economic powerhouse today, most of that industrial and economic power comes out of the West. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and subsequent reunification, there was a mass migration from the East to the West as people sought jobs. Some parts of the East feel like ghost towns today. Like there are way fewer people, than the buildings can support. Due to the limits of economic opportunity, lots of young people will move to western states for employment after school. As well the East has had much less exposure to foreigners than the West did during the Cold War. Today xenophobia and racism is more common in the East, than in the West. That attitude can also include West Germans. The wariness that can exist towards foreigners is further exacerbated by the many middle-aged and older East Germans don't speak English, as they were forced to study Russian under communist-rule. While there are regional tourist destinations in Europe, where people can get by speaking German (such as Mallorca in Spain and much of Central Europe), in order to travel further from home generally requires one to speak English (the de facto, universal language of tourism). The shortage of economic opportunity, compared to their western brethren, has led to a bit of communist nostalgia in older generations. Television specials, such as The DDR Show, look somewhat fondly backwards. As well, occasionally older generations will occasionally say things like, \"At least under communism we had jobs.\" They still have colloquial terms for East and West Germans. West Germans are called \"wessi\", while East Germans are called \"ossi\". However, DO NOT use the term ossi, if you visit Germany! The term is similar to some racially-charged language we have in the United States. If you're East German, you can use it referring to yourself and other East Germans. However, if you're not East German, it is considered very offensive. DO NOT USE IT. Just be aware than it exists. To be fair I've met some very kind and friendly people in the East German states, but the difference between the East and the West is still very palpable. ",
