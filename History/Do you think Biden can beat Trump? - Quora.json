            "answer_text": "Maybe.  Here is the latest survey. It tells us where things are. (Note to foreigners: Trump is Republican/red, and Biden is Democrat/blue). Believe it or not Texas is now a swing state. Over the last few years, hundreds of thousands of Democrats have been moving to Texas from California and this new influx in population makes the state a close race. Ohio and Georgia also remain toss-up states. If Trump loses any of these states, the election is lost. Beyond that, you can see that the Democrats pretty safely have 248 electoral votes going into this election. This places them 22 votes away from a win. Trump needs a whole 66 electoral votes to secure victory. Right now we have these states up for grab ArizonaWisconsinPennsylvaniaNorth CarolinaFloridaIf Trump losses Florida, he losses the election. Besides Florida Trump can only lose 1 swing state and must win all the rest. If Trump losses 2 swing states, he loses the election. So now I am going to update the map with 3 things. Florida: Trump. The Republican governor of Florida is very popular and is a big Trump supporter. The state is older in terms of population and tends to vote right. Given the popularity of the governor and the state\u2019s Senators I find it HIGHLY unlikely that Trump will lose Florida.Wisconsin: Biden. Wisconsin voted for Trump in 2016. This is an extremely rare move for a traditionally Democrat state. Since then Republican Senators, congressmen, and governors have been ousted by Democratic challengers. This seems to be a pretty clear indication that the Democratic has reasserted itself as the dominant party in the state.Arizona: Trump. In 2018 the Republican governor Doug Ducey was reelected and won the election by a big margin. Since then the state remains just as strongly Republican as in 2020.So in my estimation here is what we are looking at, guaranteed.  It really comes down to North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Trump has to win both states to win the election and Biden only needs to win 1. So if Biden does better than Trump in these states he wins. That is really what it comes down to. Now with these states, it is going to be tough. Really there is a lot to be seen here and its hard to say how this will go. Some big factors are COVID response: A lot of what will happen will come down to how the public views Trump\u2019s COVID response. To many Democrats, Trump\u2019s response was a total failure and they may be right. To many Republicans, Trump\u2019s response was measured and successful and they may be right. We are going to have to see what independent voters and undecided voters think. Also, please don\u2019t go into the comments and be mean to each other. We are allowed to disagree and still treat each other with respect. The media is mostly liberal-leaning and social media has shown a proclivity to advertise particular positions that they support. So in a sense, Trump is facing an uphill battle in this regard. That being said I know among many blue-collar voters there has been a strong desire to re-open. The economy was booming under Trump for the last 3 years and many want to get back to how things were going before. Blue-collar voters tend to decide elections. Had it not been for COVID I would be placing my money on Trump winning. Presidents that preside over strong economies tend to get reelected. COVID has really thrown a wrench into the works though and it has made everything unpredictable. I think this issue favors Biden in the long run as his hands are clean of the whole mess. Biden Campaign: I am not a Russian bot. I understand discussing this may upset people who support Biden but we need to openly and honestly discuss him as a candidate. This question is about Biden, not Trump. Had it been about Trump I would be discussing his flaws and issues as well. I am going to catch a lot of flak for this but hear me out. Biden has so far had a rather poor showing. The nation is in crisis and he seems to be invisible, unwilling to comment on anything. When he does comment nobody seems to really care very much. Many of his public appearances were gaff filled confusing affairs. He has looked confused and walked off-camera, he has mistaken his wife for his sister, and he has cited the wrong numbers when discussing statistics. The constant claims of \u201ccognitive decline\u201d remains unsubstantiated but prevalent none the less. You may see me discussing this as being anti-Biden but that is not the case. When I look up Biden on Tiktok or Youtube it mostly memes making fun of him. In addition, he now has a sexual assault allegation against him. I am not sure if it is true or not. If I say I believe Tara than I get flak for being alt-right but if I don\u2019t believe Tara I am anti-MeToo. Personally, though I don\u2019t see enough evidence to think he did it. Democrats are in a hard place here. They tried to remove Judge Kavanaugh from his spot on the supreme court when similar allegations emerged. If the party ignores the allegations they look bad to progressives and look hypocritical, if they don\u2019t they look bad to everyone else. It also removes some of the moral high ground. Trump has multiple sexual assault allegations against him that could be used as leverage but with Biden being in a similar (but smaller) boat it removes this as an option. Unless you want the slogan \u201cI allegedly assaulted fewer women\u201d. All that being said Biden is not necessarily a bad pick at all for the spot. He is the opposite of Trump in a lot of ways. Where Trump is rather rough and uncouth Biden is far more charming and polished. Where Trump is aggressive and dominating, Biden is calm and relaxed. Biden is the a-typical Presidential candidate. If you put out a call for an actor to play the President in a movie, you\u2019d get Biden. A lot of people may be tired of the drama around Trump and go with Biden because Biden is a safe familiar candidate. At the same time though Biden is rather unexciting. I don\u2019t see much buzz around his ideas or the changes he will make. He is running on the \u201cI\u2019m not Trump platform\u201d which may not work. He needs to generate buzz and he needs to get people excited about him. Trump is great at this and Biden will need to compete. Biden could find a great VP and run an awesome campaign and win. But if his performance so far is an accurate indication of what is to come he may fail miserably. Only time will tell. Economic recovery: If the economy can recover a good bit before November Trump will likely win. People are afraid and concerned about their livelihoods. Coming off a period of instability and fear people may stick to Trump if that means maintaining a recovering economy. This may not reflect the situation accurately, in that Trump may not be responsible for a recovering economy but none the less it will be a factor to consider. George Floyd: This is another big issue in the context of \u201cdefunding police\u201d. This is a wildly unpopular position right now among every demographic. If this position is adopted by Biden he may lose of a lot of moderate support. My prediction: I can\u2019t say for sure who I honestly think will win. There are just too many factors that remain unknown. How will Biden run his campaign? Who will make a serious mistake? What big pieces of negative information will come out about the candidates? Will the economy recover? Will COVID get worse? To be totally honest I think that right now Biden is likely to win. Statistically, Trump has to win North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Florida to win. These are all close races that are going to come down to a few thousand votes. Statistically speaking Biden has a great shot at winning simply because he only has to do well in 1 of these states where Trump needs to go great in all 3. Also, COVID was a rotten bit of luck for Trump. Disregarding the whole conversation about how well or poorly the federal government responded to the crisis it killed the economy. Traditionally strong economies get candidates re-elected while weak economies allow challengers to win. Going into 2020 the US economy was surging to record levels as the DOW neared 30,000 and unemployment dropped to below 3%. COVID turned the economy on it\u2019s head and shook things up drastically. The US media is very biased on both directions and I see no world where Trump isn\u2019t blamed for every single COVID death by large segments of the media. In other words unless the economy magically rebounds tomorrow and we cure COVID the day after I don\u2019t see Trump winning in 2020. I have one more twist here, hear me out. This may sound like Alex Jones stuff but hear me out. I have this intuition or feeling that this will be the case. If I am right people can come back here and give me credit- because I think I am right. I don\u2019t think Biden will be running for office come November. The DNC really wants to beat Trump and they have not been above shady practices in the past. I think Biden got Sanders out of the way because the DNC knew Sanders would never win. It was all rather sudden because for quite a while it seemed like Sanders was gonna win, then in the last mile, Biden jumped way out ahead. But Biden has baggage. The guy has given people dozens of horrible memes and soundbites (you ain\u2019t black) and he is hardly on TV. When Biden is being interviewed every day do you think it will be better? The DNC has to know this. I think right after Biden is given the nod to run we will see a sudden focus on Tara\u2019s allegations and past mistakes. Popular Democrats will call for Biden to step down and somebody else, handpicked by the party will get the nod. This is 100% my opinion backed by nothing substantial though. Although as a commenter John Anderson below pointed out, and as I confirmed, Biden has yet to establish a presence in states like Wisconsin. He has not hired anyone to run his campaign in that state which is very strange. The election is only a few months out and Trump has been targeting these states for years. It is really odd for a candidate to not be investing in swing states in late June. I just wanted to put it here in case I am right. I am likely wrong but I just have this gut feeling that before too long Biden will be stepping down to make way for his VP pick or for Cuomo. If I am right, make sure to come back and make me internet famous! If I am wrong I will fully admit it. ",

            "answer_text": "What makes Biden a better candidate than Trump? Literally everything. For a moment, let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s 2016 and it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden with an outgoing Obama administration. Now one choice is a man with no government experience, with a history of failed marriages and failed businesses, who was born rich and went bankrupt because he couldn\u2019t figure out how to turn a profit with a casino. A man who keeps saying he has big plans but offers no substance. A man who bullies his detractors and whose campaign was built on attacking people of color, including the President, who he spent years accusing of forging his birth certificate. The other choice is a man who has spent nearly half a century in public service. He knows how government works. He has good working relationships with leaders of both parties and with our allies. He served in the administration that saved the American auto industry, successfully navigated two epidemics, brought the economy back from the brink of a second Great Depression, killed Public Enemy Number One Osama bin Laden, and despite obstruction and false accusations from the opposition party, secured healthcare for 15 million uninsured Americans and did it all without a single indictment of any member of the administration. A man whose only Achilles heel is that he famously misspeaks often. So now let\u2019s move forward four years. Biden still puts his foot in his mouth, but the only thing that has actually changed is now we know that Trump can\u2019t handle the job. Before the coronavirus pandemic he had flatlined a growing economy, been impeached for abusing his office, had been found to have committed ten distinct acts of obstruction of justice to cover up his illegal coordination with Russian interference in the 2016 election, he set a record for public lies by a sitting President, spent 300 years of Presidential salaries on golf trips\u2014with much of that money going back into his own pockets, almost triggered world war three, doubled the deficit, bankrupted American farmers and businesses with his ill-advised trade war, and set a record for indictments, guilty pleas, and convictions by members of an administration. Then he mishandled the coronavirus pandemic and 100,000 Americans died, unemployment more than tripled, and the deficit went up tenfold. And now America is on fire and he\u2019s literally hiding in the White House with the lights turned off. In fairness he did tear gas some peaceful protesters yesterday so he could leave the White House for a photo op, but I don\u2019t think pointing that out helps him. That\u2019s the choice. Competency and integrity, or four more years of a dumpster fire. ",

            "answer_text": "He certainly can. That doesn't mean he will, but it's looking good for him at this moment. A lot can happen in two months. If, by some miracle of miracles, the United States can fully develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine prior to the election, turn out the lights, because it's four more years of Trump. I would be enormously shocked if we can pull that one off. If, again, by some miracle of miracles we can successfully get the kids back to school full time without cases spiking, same deal. But, sorry, that's not going to happen. If somehow the Trump campaign can find some dirt to definitively prove Joe Biden has done something completely unforgivable (sexual assault, etc.), then that definitely will take the wind out of his sails. Not beyond the realm of possibility, but I have strong doubts. What can help Joe Biden are strong performances at the debates by him against Donald Trump, and Kamala Harris against Mike Pence. Joe can hold his own, but he has to be able to play the game that The Donald is going to play. You know, the constant interruptions, the childish nicknames and put downs, brooding about the stage, etc. I think he's more prepared to deal with that effectively than Hillary was. The Pence-Harris debate, though, is going to be electric!! I don't agree with very much of what Mr. Pence has to say, but he is a skilled debater. Mrs. Harris is, too, and she knows how to drive a point home, with an exclamation point. It's going to be sick. And, who knows if some October Surprise could come and bite The Donald in the rear? If COVID-19 sees a resurgence, if he and the Feds botch a natural disaster response (again!), if unemployment gets worse, if he exacerbates relations with a foreign power, etc. Right now, Joe Biden has held a consistent lead both nationally and in all the important swing states. Things are starting to tighten, so neither major candidate has this \u201cin the bag\u201d yet. The next few weeks are going to be crucial. Whomever you're planning to vote for, please, be safe at the polls, or else request your absentee ballot and submit it as early as you are permitted. See y'all at the polls!! ",

Goldman Sachs has now contributed more to Biden\u2019s Campaign than any other candidate[6]   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 THE CORPORATE CAMPAIGN IN THE STREETS \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Violence is waging in streets all across America. This violence is being blamed on Trump, but it\u2019s not Trump. It\u2019s the result of the installation of progressive left politicians bought and paid for with the money of a Wall Street billionaire. George Soros, another democrat mega donor has contributed more to the Biden campaign than anyone[7]through his Democracy PAC [8]    \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 BUYING SOFT ON CRIME \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- George Soros, has for years,[9] been controlling the violence in the streets of America, through the District Attorneys and Prosecutors of America\u2019s major municipalities via campaign contributions made through the Safety and Justice PAC.[10]  Violence under the guise of BLM, co-opted by Antifa, is happening in cities all across America. They are run by DA\u2019s and Prosecutors funded by George Soros through a variety of organizations.[11]  Some of the worst violence in America is happening in Portland, Oregon because[12]  Mike Schmidt\u2019s campaign was funded by George Soros.[13]  The PAC has received millions of dollars from Soros from individual contributions and his other super pacs.[14]  George Soros and the progressive left are fomenting and enabling violence in the streets of America and blaming it on Trump. [15] And the American Voter is not allowed to know. The Corporate Controlled Media are lying to us. The media are gaslighting the American people and projecting it onto Trump. Follow the money. It\u2019s all right here. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- WHY ARE THE MEDIA LYING TO VOTERS? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 I\u2019ve written an extensive answer to another question that goes into detail about why, which I won\u2019t repeat here, but can read here: Paul Jackson's answer to Will Joe Biden lose the 2020 presidential elections? Another answer details why we can\u2019t trust the media in their portrayal of Trump or Biden. They\u2019ve actually shifted their opinion of him since his prior presidential campaigns. He never got more than a couple percentage points in the primaries. Quora has blacklisted the entire question. But you can read it here: Paul Jackson's answer to Why is Biden\u2019s racism less appalling than Trumps?   That\u2019s weird right? Many of the few people who stumble upon it, seem to like it, and I spent a lot of time researching it.  5% of readers up voting it is significant. Both of the answers combined present a picture of the American Political landscape that presents my argument for why Trump is going to win again, despite the image presented to the American people that Biden is the inevitably victorious white knight come to save us from fascism. The opposite is the truth. We are being duped. The media is broken. The media is paid to coerce the American People to vote for Joe Biden at their peril. I believe the American voter knows this deep down and that awareness will reveal itself on election night. The short story is: The media are guided by corporate money and want war. Donald Trump does not want war and when he avoided war with Iran in January 2020, the media and the DNC began their strategy to unseat him, but they are failing miserably. The only thing cited to support a Biden victory is polling data. However, the pollsters are collaborating with the media. The polls are paid for by the media. The pollsters are not gauging public opinion with the polls, they are guiding it. The corporate media from both the Left and the Right are collaborating to force Joe Biden on the American People, but they are both liars. Trump will win, because every reason to vote for Joe Biden is a lie. Trump does not want warTrump is not dividing AmericaTrump is not responsible for the violence in our streetsThe Democrats are and they control Joe Biden. The truth will win. Joe Biden will not.

            "answer_text": "(Full disclosure: I am a Conservative and will likely be voting for Trump in the next election. To the best of my ability though, this is an attempt at an apolitical description of Biden\u2019s chances against Trump, as an electoral game of tactics.) Yes, so long as the election is a referendum on Trump and not Biden. One of the key factors behind 2016 was that the American electorate focused more on their distaste for Clinton as a candidate, than Trump\u2019s qualifications for the same position. In 2020, the picture will be at least partially reversed: Trump will have his own record in politics to defend, which reduces some of the appeal that he carried as an outsider when he first ran for office. The only problem is that Joe Biden has a lengthy record himself, and his ability to defend it is hampered by the general leftward drift of the Democratic Party relative to himself. While the moderates within the Democratic Party were able to overwhelm the hard Progressive wing headed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, they cannot afford to ignore them entirely and still have a prayer of maintaining a cohesive base which can carry Biden through the General Election. By that same token, if Biden strays too far into the hard Progressive camp, he risks alienating the general American populace. This risk is especially present with regards to the tearing down of statues of famous figures in American history, which will likely be upsetting to those not too ensconced in politics. The solution from the Democratic side is obvious. Stay quiet, and let all of the national attention fixate on Trump, and pray that he detonates his re-election chances himself. Considering his lack of discipline when it comes to his public rhetoric, that could very well work. However, this also carries dangers. For one, it risks giving Trump the initiative to determine the conversation. While most news media outlets are supportive of the Democrats, they cannot help but play off of Trump to drive viewer engagement, which gives Trump the advantage in terms of picking topics. The 2016 elections were not initially focused on immigration until Trump entered the scene with divisive (and therefore widely discussed) comments on illegal immigration across the Mexican border. And for another, it could expose Biden to negative public attention rather than mitigate it. The game of democratic politics is the game of making easier to vote for you, as supposed to voting for the other guy. Trump is excellent at this, insofar as it relates to poisoning the public perceptions of his opposition. From his surprise victories in the Republican primaries, to the General Election itself, he consistently displayed talent at re-framing his opponents in unflattering ways in the eyes of the public. The more public attention Trump is allowed to hoard for himself, the more opportunities he has to disrupt Biden\u2019s public image. Considering the latter\u2019s decades in politics, it is unlikely Trump will lack for material on this front, some of it brought front and center by Biden\u2019s former primary opponents. When it comes to debates, Biden is going to have a harder time defending himself than when he ran as Obama\u2019s VP, due to the balancing act that he has to play with his own party, which (at least to my eyes) seems much more fractured than the Republican base. This highlights the issue of Joe Biden\u2019s capacity. I watched all of the Democratic primary debates. He is not as rhetorically sharp as he used to be, and that will hurt his public image in the eyes of voters, and could inflame concerns regarding his mental health and fitness. In fact, it may be more practical for the Biden campaign to dispense with the debates in order to avoid just such a scenario, citing concerns over the pandemic. Trump will slam him for it, of course, but that can be justified to Biden\u2019s own base as Trump simply not caring enough about the virus. It would not be a costless strategy, but neither is participating in the debates. If Biden maintains his current lead in the polls, I would definitely be pushing for that if I was Biden\u2019s campaign strategist. However, just because Trump won the last time using this method does not mean he will win again. Biden is a much less disliked candidate than Clinton was, and as such has a lot more flexibility when it comes to how he can respond to Trump\u2019s attacks. Additionally, Trump as the incumbent will be held responsible by the American people generally for the overall status of the United States. If there is no V-shaped economic recovery, and/or if Trump\u2019s administration is regarded as having failed to have dealt with the current pandemic, his base may not be energized and his re-election may be in jeopardy. If Trump cannot persuade the American people that his re-election will guarantee future stability and prosperity (or at the very least, that Joe Biden will not) his paths to victory are limited, and I think we are seeing that sentiment in the latest poll numbers. Ultimately, once candidates get to the national level, there is almost always the potential for victory from either party. Sometimes events beyond the candidates control work against them (economic troubles, social upheaval, etc.), and sometimes the candidates themselves do something unabashedly stupid which saps their base of support. A lot can change over the course of a few days, never mind several months. ",

            "answer_text": "ABSOLUTELY, BIDEN CAN WIN and this is a non-partisan position. It should be obvious by now, it is July 10, all of the previous answers to this question are older and off. Here is what will happen as the trends are now clear: PLUS FOR TRUMP BEYOND JUST HOLDING HIS BASE: FOX and Tucker and Laura and then there is Rush; they will all hold the base right down to the last person however;NONE, NO PLAN BEYOND THAT, IN FACT AN ANTI PLAN, THAT IS IT, BASE ONLY AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH.Economy cannot come back -the only other card for Trump as the US handling of the pandemic has been among the worst in the world. No matter how many people Trump runs over on this, he cannot stop the pandemic just by yelling at people and right now at 60,000 cases a day with death rates rising again, this is approaching biblical proportions for complete out of control. Shut down states like it is happening, off and on again and again, he cannot pull this one out no matter how many nail salons reopen.Those countries who did it well are even falling back : Even the best like Australia and Hong Kong are now suffering. The pandemic will be with us for 2\u20134 years and the USA will keep floundering, open/close/open. There is no way he can jam the economy to come back quickly no matter how much he threatens and blusters. Today its the schools, tomorrow something else. The June numbers already show the short lived up of last month when they opened nail salons, bars, restaurants and hair salons; all \u2018fake\u2019 economy is crashing back as none of these jobs are essential and all are ready to crash over and over each time there is a hiccup in the pandemic like right now!He has his base, he has doubled, tripled down. Great job, he may get 99% approval among them by Nov 3. He is fighting a battle he knows and loves, fear, culture wars, any job is a good job. This is a losing strategy as:Base is getting smaller: He has only 40% max of the voting pop in his base. It is not enough.He will lose the swing states as:PLUS FOR BIDEN BEYOND WHAT HRC DID IN 2016: Biden is truly a well liked person and is more than capable. If the only bad thing you can say is the other guy is 3 years older than Trump and a bit slower, it just falls on deaf ears.His record of \u2018working across the aisle\u2019 is real. That means NO NEGATIVE I HATE BIDEN LIKE IT HAPPENED WITH HILLARY WHO A LARGE PART OF THE COUNTRY COULDN\u2019T STAND. There were millions who did not like her, this cannot be said of Biden.Economics - Biden unveiled his plan today; Manufacturing, infrastructure, buy American. GOOD JOBS, WELL PAID JOBS, UNION JOBS, NOT FAKE ECONOMY NAIL SALON JOBS. Trump has not delivered on quality jobs and infrastructure is literally falling apart. This will get Biden over the line in PA where he is from which just about puts him over the top. Also Michigan where a popular Dem gov has stood her ground despite Trump\u2019s attacks and against all odds is winning. She will be a massive supporter for Biden and she will get out the vote.Other Swing States - With MI and PA in the bag for Biden, It really doesnt matter after that as he is over the top on the electoral votes. MN will go to Biden for sure as he is 15% up on Trump. Biden might get AZ or Fl but he doesn\u2019t need them. All of the HRC states are solid for Biden and Trump will get angrier and crazier right up to the end driving away people in the swing states.Turn Out -Biden will choose a VP woman of color, this will guarantee 99% Black and 80% Latinx vote.Hatred of Trump is so high that every person will do whatever they can to vote for Biden all out of fear of what 4 more years of Trump will do to the country and the world and the future.Suburban Women have had enough - They showed what they could do in 2018, expect them to back Biden as:EVERYONE IS TIRED OF THE REALITY TV STAR WHO RAILS ON ABOUT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. So yes Biden can win. Just keep offering great new economic policies, stick to his positions and don\u2019t pay attention to Trump\u2019s craziness except to point out each time a sane, meaning true American values, alternative. NORMALCY IS WHAT WILL WIN THIS AND THE REAL CAMPAIGN TO MAKE AMERICA SANE AND GREAT AGAIN FOR EVERYONE NOT JUST THE RICH. And there is no one more normal than Joe Biden. ",

The best socialist liberal policy for you to see is Venezuela. It was started by Hugo Sanchev. Today Venezuela in anarchy. Starvation and complete ruin although it holds largest oil reserves in the world, more than Saudi. All animals in the zoo are killed and eaten by citizens due to starvation. Graves are dug up for valuables to be sold. Army patrols the streets daily, just like the riots and looting going on in Democrats cities in USA. If you look at map below nearly all cities under curfew are Democrats run.

            "answer_text": "At least you are honest and this isn\u2019t one of those anonymous questions. Pro-Biden : 1: non-corrupt. Despite the mudslinging and innuendo there is nothing in his past that even indicates corruption. He didn\u2019t make any real money until he left the WH and wrote a book and went on speaking tours. 2: makes attempts to work with both sides of the aisle. During his entire career he has worked and passed bi-partisan bills. 3: government, legislative and executive branch experience. This makes him qualified to know and work with the government as a whole. There are plenty more, but let\u2019s just stick to the top 3 on each one. Pro-Trump: 1: He kept the economy going full blast after Obama left office 2: He attempted to broker a deal with North Korea 3: He gave a total of over 20 billion to help the farmers Anti-Biden: 1: He is too old, he is 77 years old going into the election 2: He is part of the \u201cswamp\u201d the \u201csame old same old\u201d in Washington. 3: He wants to reinstate Obamacare Anti-Trump: 1: Corrupt. There is no doubt about this one. From his personal history to his presidency you can see how he tries to make money Personally off what he does at the expense of others. 2: Geo-politically incompetent. OK, I will admit, this is my own thought here. He has toadied up to dictators and pushed away our historical allies and insulted them at gatherings. He has abandoned allies to be slaughtered. Much more here that will not fit into a small paragraph. 3: Does not understand economics on a global scale. Part of the reason he had to bail out the farmers with that much money (which is more than twice it cost the U.S. to bail out the auto-industry) is that he didn\u2019t understand that a trade war is not easy. There are problems with both sides\u2026In my opinion our current president has sent this country down on a path for disaster. While Biden is not my favorite of the Democratic candidates he is an honest man and has proven that for over 40 years and has had pain in his life having to deal with losing his family, both his first wife and daughter and then losing his son Beau to cancer. There is a lot of mudslinging going after Biden : dementia (he has lifelong stutter) which people seem to feel indicates dementia. Corruption? He was one of if not the poorest Congressman, as I said it wasn\u2019t until he wrote his book and went and spoke that he made money. I am voting for Biden, I can\u2019t force anyone to do the same and I know my essay didn\u2019t include all the cons I believe about DJT. If you have not been watching the news, it may be tough to convince anyone. ",

Many are American first. Nearly 350 prominent Republicans voting for Joe Biden Or just possibly were you asking which was the stronger morally as a good strong American citizen? Yet again I must say Biden. The year Trump announced his running, he paid the largest fine that FinCen (US Treasury Financial Crimes) had ever imposed for massive long term money laundering. It wasn\u2019t the first time either. FinCEN Fines Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort $10 Million for Significant and Long Standing Anti-Money Laundering Violations News | FinCEN.gov CNN Just Proved Trump\u2019s Taj Mahal Has Laundered Money For 20 Years And during the election he paid $25 million for ripping off the life savings of hundreds of people. Yes, Trump University Was a Massive Scam | National Review And wile he was president, the Court found his charity was a scam and he illegally stole money for his campaign and himself. Trump paid $2 million for misusing his charity, New York attorney general says But possibly you\u2019re asking about power in a loyalty/gangster environment? Well that throws the balance off. While Biden\u2019s wife is willing to risk herself for Biden, Trump has had followers that threatened people, beat, mailed bombs to and murdered them because of what he said. Violence in the name of Trump Well Biden has millions that will vote for him. And I personally will be at the polls ready to fight against Trump\u2019s \u201cpoll watchers\u201d. I will risk injury or death for everyone's legal ability to vote without harassment I won\u2019t die for Biden. While there are thousands that say they are ready to kill for Trump.

I also think that the best answer to a political question is to wipe all ounces of bias and focus on a statistical answer. Also, being outside the US (With family inside) gives me a bit of separation to do so; People I speak to have said that they are better off with Trump in control (Monetary, quality of life, etc). People I speak to have said that Trumps policies are out of control (FCC running amok, foreign policy, etc). People state that Trump doesn\u2019t speak like a politician, people can relate. (Just watch a press release, he does not care what people think as long as he speaks his mind.) People state that Trumps foreign policy communications and press releases are ridiculous. (He does not care what people think, as long as people vote for him. He doesn\u2019t care for the feelings of say\u2026Press workers, other governmental officials, not a team player. He doesn\u2019t care what people have to say unless they agree with him.) You get where I\u2019m going with this? Everyone you ask will have a slightly differing opinion, but there is no doubt that Trumps term in office has been polarizing, not just in the USA, but globally. Whether that\u2019s good or bad is down to personal opinion. Statistically speaking, Biden can defeat Trump in the upcoming election. It\u2019s simple math.But, it\u2019s whether he gets the votes. He could get the votes, but all we know is that it is possible. I think the question \u201cCan Biden defeat Trump?\u201d is irrelevant and a more pertinent question would be; \u201cWhat will happen if Biden defeats Trump?\u201d. This is a question that will get people thinking about the outcome and focusing on who they want as their next POTUS. This isn\u2019t a war against Trump at the end of the day, this is America deciding what sort of country it wants to be. The same as every election for every country that has a legitamate voting system. (The above opinions are not the opinions of myself, just people I\u2019ve spoken to. I refuse to air my own opinions. They aren\u2019t important at the end of the day) ",

So, between the polls and the odds forecasters, I would say those are two strong indicators . . . \u2014But reality can be against both. Americans have short term memories and long term forgiveness . . . many things can happen before and on election day. Overconfident voters may sit out to watch tv, or do what it is that sidetracks them on such a crucial election night. Trump is relying on Putin to interfere with elections again\u2014if not, why has he not led the way in investigating what happened in 2016. Those that think the Stock Market is more important than the Constitution will be out in strength to support dictator Trump. All the racists, now they have been legitimized by dictator Trump, will be out in force to exercise their uncloseted power to keep their idol in power. The rampant civil unrest, that has put focus more on the radical Democratic element is not doing anything but helping dictator Trump: Even though he has put troops on main street America, and through his own radical racism has been equally to blame. His continued lying and downplaying COVID-19 has produced millions of believers going about flaunting actual medical advice. These unmasked people are definitely Republican radical supporters intent on keeping their idol in office. Such lambs will definitely be at the voting booths in great numbers. Last, but most importantly, the silent moderate Republicans and Democrats, that complain but don\u2019t do enough publicly, or actively vote, will be Biden\u2019s weakest group of voters to depend on. Where have they been the last four years? Will they vote for what is right? Primarily will the moderate Republicans do what is right for America and vote for Biden? The other problem is Biden. If it were not for how terrible our infantile, egomaniac, one percent rich kid in office is, Biden would not be that strong of a candidate. Biden\u2019s only major attraction is getting rid of dictator Trump\u2014any moderate Republican presidential candidate could have easily defeated Biden. As a former 2016 Trump voter, it is the only reason I am voting for Biden this November. I would rather take a chance on socialism than the growing Nazism that Trump is supporting. One I can tolerate, the other disgusts me. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a funny thing y'know, every other viable democratic nominee candidate had a good chance of beating Donald Trump (specifically Bernie, as he beats Trump in EVERY exit poll), and yet we chose Joe Biden. Joe Biden is the weakest candidate I've ever seen. Weaker than Hillary\u2026 and she LOST. Did you know that 35% of Biden voters actually support him for his policies? And the other 65% are voting for him soley because he's not Trump. He's not giving anybody a reason to vote for him based on his policies. Before you ask I'm not a Republican- (or a Democrat for that matter). I'm an unbiased independent and I call BS out when I see it. I'm 16 by the way :) 88% of democrats support M4A 85% support a wealth tax 85% support the green new deal And 75% support student debt cancellation Yet Joe Biden supports NONE of them. Not even universal basic income. It's not that he can't, it's because he doesn't want to. Why? Because of his corporate donors. We don't need reform, we need bold changes NOW. He needs to step his game up. He doesn't deserve the nomination, he barely even campaigned outside of South Carolina and he still isn't actively public during this time. It's a fucking pandemic and he's no where to be seen. He's not a leader. He's not what we need. Why should we vote for him other than the fact that he's not Trump? A lot of people, including myself, despise Joe Biden for reasons other than his shitty policies. If he ever wants to win progressives, he's got to give us what we, and what the MAJORITY of democrats want. He's our nominee ffs, he's supposed to deliver what we want because he's representing us. It blows my mind every single day that Americans chose Biden over Bernie. Bernie has been right on EVERYTHING, his policies supported EVERYTHING that Democrats wanted, and yet here we are. Bernie was right this entire time, and you let him down because you listened to the tv, which is heavily biased by the way. To answer your question, if Joe Biden continues running JUST an anti-trump campaign, he will lose. ",

            "answer_text": "In my humble opinion, no. First, the statistics aren't in his favor: Only two former Vice Presidents have ever run for President \u2014 Richard Nixon in 1968 and Walter Mondale in 1984. Nixon won a three-way race, with 43% of the vote; Mondale ran against a popular incumbent.The polls showing him leading Bernie Sanders by double digits are suspect, at best. There are very few Millennials with land lines these days. While Gallup has been including cell phone users in its polling since 2008, the same cannot be said for other polling organizations. Including cell phone users in a poll is more expensive and requires the human element (as opposed to robo-callers). So, the jury is still out on just how much these polls can be relied upon.So much for the registered Democrats. I'm not one of those people who blames the DNC and \u201cthe establishment\u201d to the exclusion of all else. On the contrary, I blame the voters as well, and one of my biggest beefs is against the registered Democratic voters who are so willfully myopic that they cannot see that it is not only their opinion that counts. If you're trying to sell a candidate to the whole nation, it makes sense to properly gauge what the voters want (not to presume to know what they want) and elect in the primaries a candidate that is going to appeal across as broad a spectrum as possible. I'm especially vehement on this point because those voters who consistently support the establishment center-right candidates continue to dig their heels into the ground with protests of \u201cIt's our party!\u201d and \u201cNever Bernie!\u201d when there is no good reason to do so. A progressive candidate, be it Bernie Sanders or someone else, stands for all the things they claim to want. Their only reason for opposing that candidate is because they feel that what he/she wants is \u201cnot realistic\". The reality of today's political landscape is that 44% of the registered voters in the U.S. are registered Independents, the largest percentage of such in living memory. Also, the Millennials are on the fast track to becoming the largest age group voting bloc in the country, and they are overwhelmingly progressive in their politics. Bernie Sanders is the most popular politician in the country, and given how very difficult it is to beat an incumbent President running for re-election, the Democrats had better nominate a rock star to run in 2020, or we're going to have four more years of Trump. So, no, Biden doesn't have a chance of beating Trump. He just won't excite the Independents and the Millennials, because those groups will want to know what he brings to the table (his \u201cGive me a break!\u201d statement about the Millennials will work decisively against him with that group). And the answer is that he doesn't offer anything of substance or any new ideas, only \u201cOh my God, Trump is horrible!\u201d, and that's a recipe for an election night loss. Update, 17 July 2020: I answered this question last year in June, in the context of the pre-primary debates. My answer would be very different today. It\u2019s not so much about people voting for Biden as it is against Trump. We haven't had a presidential election like this one for a long time, and it's going to get mighty interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "Most likely not; 1 Trump did not have the support of the republican party at the last election. The ground game just wasn\u2019t there. This is worth an additional 2%. 2 Biden is old and senile, to replace a sitting president it is difficult, if things are going okay, why change? Obama/Bush/Clinton, Carter was a disaster in the public\u2019s eye at the time. Bush Snr, Clinton ran the perfect campaign, it\u2019s the economy Stupid. Biden simply doesn\u2019t have any of that type of game. 3 War Time - it is rare for the sitting president to ousted during or just after war. Coronavirus is a war. 4 Biden is not popular, as we have seen from the primaries people couldn\u2019t be bothered to come out in numbers to vote 5 Corruption - the negative advertising has much to work with 6 War Chests - last time Trump had less than a third of the current war chest, let alone what more they can raise 7 Vote suppression - at the last election it was not polls and indeed in the US the polls don\u2019t matter, it is all about who can be bothered to vote. Trump has a fanatical base, Biden well\u2026.. 8 Local issues - at the last election, Trump was expected to win the popular vote and lose the election. As we know the opposite happened. What wasn\u2019t factored in was the local issues mostly around Cannabis that increased the vote. This time around it does not appear to be anywhere the same level. What will get the democrats out to vote? 9 2018 is not an indicator, you are talking about very low numbers of voters and as Bloomberg stated the spending of the democrats was substantial. So for Biden to win people will have to really hate Trump and be bothered to come out and vote. They simply don\u2019t appear to be bothered. ",

            "answer_text": "Biden is competent, has government and leadership experience. Trump has failing businesses, a series of bankruptcies and well, here is a short list that covers from 2016\u20132018 only. Does not his disastrous failure of protecting the USA from COVID-19. The list: The government is currently going through its longest shutdown in history, with no end in sight. And Trump\u2019s to blame. He said it himself, \u201cI will be the one to shut it down.\u201d Trump\u2019s only significant legislative accomplishment gave massive tax breaks to rich and big corporations, while doing nothing to benefit workers. Trump vowed to protect Medicare and Social Security, but has proposed drastic cuts to both programs. He repeatedly promised that he would lower the costs of prescription drugs within weeks, but that hasn\u2019t happened. Trump\u2019s ongoing campaign to sabotage the Affordable Care Act has made health care less accessible and less affordable for millions of Americans. Trump has demonized and attacked immigrants while doing nothing to actually solve the issue of illegal immigration. He separated families, attacked asylum rights, and played politics with the lives of Dreamers. Trump has faced serious investigations throughout his presidency that are examining his campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia, whether he committed obstruction of justice and whether he, himself - the President of the United States - has acted as a Russian agent. After two years, it\u2019s already clear that Trump won\u2019t deliver on his campaign promises, he has completely abandoned workers and families, and his presidency is a failure. Trump Shutdown: Abandoned Workers And Failed Leadership Trump is responsible for the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. He said it himself, \u201cI will be the one to shut it down.\u201d Trump has abandoned hundreds of thousands of workers who do not know when their next paycheck will come. The Trump Shutdown is the longest in our history, and the third of Trump\u2019s presidency. Before Trump, no shutdown had occurred when one party controlled the House, Senate and White House since the 1970s. Americans increasingly blame Trump for the government shutdown, and his approval rating has slid dramatically since the shutdown began. The Trump Shutdown is pushing the economy closer to a recession. It has eroded Americans optimism in the economy and support for Trump\u2019s economic policies. Hundreds of thousands of workers missed their paychecks. The Trump Shutdown has so far cost workers more than $5,000 in wages on average. Nearly one million government contractors are out of work because of the shutdown. Coast Guard members missed their paychecks. This is the first time in our history active-duty service members have not been paid during a lapse in government funding. Trump\u2019s Failed Economic Policies Trump repeatedly touts the economy as one of his biggest accomplishments, but under Trump\u2019s watch wages remained largely stagnant, the stock market Trump once touted has plummeted, and the economic outlook of our country has worsened. While his administration has given wealthy corporations a short-term boost, they\u2019ve rolled back crucial protections for consumers, student borrowers, retirees, and working Americans across the country. The gap between the richest Americans and everyone else has grown under Trump\u2019s watch. The economic indicators Trump has frequently pointed to as evidence of his policies\u2019 success have all begun to falter Last year, the stock market had its worst year since the 2008 financial crisis. Last month, a key manufacturing index tumbuled by the largest amount in a decade. Manufacturers\u2019 confidence plunged to the lowest levels in two years. Consumer confidence fell to its lowest levels in over two years. Americans are more pessimistic about the future of the economy than they\u2019ve been in nearly two decades. The Trump administration has systematically rolled back crucial protections for workers and consumers to benefit corporate interests and donors. Trump eliminated protections for student borrowers, gutted enforcement of payday lenders, and let corporate wrongdoers off the hook. The Trump Tax Law Did Not Benefit Workers Trump promised workers that his massive tax cuts for the rich and big corporations would benefit workers, create economic growth, and pay for itself. None of that happened. Corporate profit growth hit a 6-year high, and corporations used their massive tax breaks for a record-high $1 trillion of stock buybacks. Workers did not benefit. 60 percent of voters said they had not seen an increase in their paychecks as a result of the Trump tax law. The Trump tax law has not created jobs. In fact, the 1,000 largest public companies actually eliminated nearly 140,000 jobs since the tax law was passed. The federal deficit swelled by more than 40 percent compared to a year ago largely because of a sharp decline in corporate tax revenues, and the CBO said the Trump tax law would add $1.9 trillion to the debt over the next decade. While workers were left behind, Trump and his family benefit greatly from the Trump tax law. Ivanka and Jared stand to benefit from a tax break they pushed, which offers massive tax breaks to real estate developers. Kushner\u2019s family business bought $13 million in additional properties after they were designated part of an \u201copportunity zone\u201d by Trump\u2019s tax law. Trump and his family benefit substantially from massive tax cuts given to the richest Americans, and from tax breaks given to \u201cpass-through\u201d entities like the Trump Organization. Trump Did Nothing To Lower Prescription Drug Costs Trump promised to bring down prescriptions drug costs. Instead, he gave massive tax breaks to pharmaceutical companies and did nothing to actually lower costs, which continue to skyrocket. Despite Trump\u2019s promises, pharmaceutical companies have already raised prices on more than one thousand drugs so far this year, including increases of nearly 10%. The biggest drug companies announced more than $50 billion in stock buybacks after the Trump tax law, but made no plans to lower drug prices. Trump\u2019s drug pricing plan did nothing to lower costs, and could actually increase out-of-pocket costs for millions of patients. House Democrats have already gotten to work to lower costs and launched an investigation into pharmaceutical companies raising prescription drug prices. Trump Made Health Care Less Accessible And Less Affordable Voters made their voices heard in the midterm elections: They overwhelmingly oppose Trump\u2019s sabotage. While the Trump administration has not learned its lesson, Democrats will never stop fighting to ensure that health care is a right for all. Trump\u2019s health care sabotage is forcing premium increases as high as double-digits on millions of Americans this year, and millions more are priced out of the market and unable to afford coverage at all. For two years running, the open enrollment period saw a decline in health insurance sign-ups. 2019 saw a 4% drop in health insurance sign ups compared to last year because of Trump\u2019s sabotage. Trump immediately celebrated a court ruling in favor of a lawsuit he backed to overturn the ACA. Here\u2019s what Trump was really celebrating: Potentially taking health care coverage away from around 20 million Americans. Putting as many as 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions at risk of losing key protections. Confusing tens of thousands of Americans who typically enroll in health care on the final days of open enrollment, making it harder for them to get the care they need. Trump broke his promise to address the opioid crisis. He failed to take the advice of his presidential commission to declare the opioid epidemic a national emergency, and tried to cut Medicaid and ACA benefits \u2014 both of which have played a key role in expanding access to substance abuse treatment. Though Trump fortunately failed to push through repeal legislation, he has continued his endless campaign to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. Here are just a few examples: New rules proposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would increase out-of-pocket costs, drive up premiums, and put health care out of reach for many Americans. The Trump administration issued new guidance encouraging states to skirt the ACA\u2019s current income and coverage standards for federal health insurance subsidies. One day after the midterm elections, Trump finalized a new rule \u2014 which now faces a legal challenge \u2014 to roll back the ACA\u2019s requirement that employers provide birth control coverage. Trump\u2019s administration repeatedly slashed funds for enrollment assistance and advertising programs intended to get Americans covered. Trump Broke His Promises To Protect Social Security And Medicare Trump vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare, but that was a lie. Trump tried to cut billions from these vital programs that millions of families and seniors rely on, and would have cut even more to pay for his massive tax cuts for the rich and big corporations. Medicare and Social Security both weakened under Trump. Trump sought a $554 billion cut to Medicare. Trump sought a $72.5 billion cut to Social Security disability insurance and supplemental security income. Trump Has Abandoned Our Nation\u2019s Veterans Trump constantly lies about his accomplishments and has repeatedly shown disrespect to veterans and military service members. Despite saying he supports our troops, Trump has not done enough to help our nation\u2019s veterans. Trump\u2019s government shutdown disproportionately hurts our nation\u2019s veterans. Trump\u2019s VA is planning to betray millions of veterans by rerouting billions of dollars from veterans\u2019 hospitals into the private sector. Trump\u2019s VA set aside $6.2 million last year alone to advertise its crisis hotline to reach vulnerable veterans and prevent suicides, but it spent less than 1% of that budget. Trump\u2019s VA is being steered by three of his Mar-a-Lago cronies with no relevant experience. Veterans have not been able to get the GI Bill payments they need and earned because of failures at Trump\u2019s VA. Trump\u2019s CFPB made it harder for the the Military Lending Act to protect service members and their families from deceitful lending practices. Trump\u2019s Fearmongering And Anti-Immigrant Policies Trump started his campaign by attacking immigrant communities, and that would come to define his presidency. Trump has continued to fearmonger and push his anti-immigrant agenda, tearing thousands of children from their families, attacking immigrants rights, and diminishing the U.S. as a beacon for the world. The Trump administration separated thousands more children from their families than previously believed. Multiple immigrant children have died while in the Trump administration\u2019s custody. The Trump administration fired tear gas at children and their families seeking asylum at the border. The Trump administration sought to rescind the right to asylum from victims of domestic violence and gang violence. Americans overwhelmingly oppose Trump\u2019s border wall. Trump has repeatedly tried to manufacture a crisis at the border by lying and demonizing immigrants. The Trump administration announced they would cap the number of refugees that can enter the country at the lowest level in the program\u2019s history. Trump rescinded the DACA program and then sabotaged multiple bipartisan deals to protect Dreamers. Trump has tried to end temporary protected status for immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Sudan. Trump Has Made Us Less Safe Trump has repeatedly embarrassed us on the global stage, and his leadership has made us less safe and caused the world to lose respect for the United States. Time and again, Trump has praised dictators, while alienating our allies, and chose to side with the likes of Vladimir Putin over our U.S. intelligence agencies. Despite Trump\u2019s summit and claims that he neutralized North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat, North Korea secretly continued to build new missile bases. Global approval of the U.S. hit a new low under Trump. Trump damaged relationships with key allies, and the decline of America\u2019s standing left openings for other countries to fill the leadership void. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the U.N. human rights council. Donald Trump praised dictators like North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un and he extended a warm invitation to Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte, who has openly defended the murder of journalists and extrajudicial killings. Trump refused to accept U.S. intelligence and stood by Saudi Arabia after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Trump stood on the global stage and sided with Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies. Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian officials in the Oval Office. Trump\u2019s Swamp After campaigning on a populist pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d Trump has only further transformed Washington to enrich himself and his wealthy friends. Trump stocked his administration with donors and former lobbyists, and let special interest groups and corporations draft their own policy. His Cabinet secretaries have used their positions for their personal gain, while wasting taxpayer dollars. Trump broke one of his central campaign promises to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d by enacting reforms to reduce lobbying and influence peddling. Instead, the lobbying industry has boomed, while Trump has watered down lobbying restrictions and issue broad ethics exemptions to members of his administration. More than a dozen of Trump\u2019s top appointees have been forced out amid ethics scandals, including three Cabinet secretaries in the last year. Trump\u2019s culture of corruption has permeated his administration with an endless string of misuse of taxpayer dollars, conflicts of interest, and concealing information. Trump himself has continued to profit off the presidency through numerous conflicts of interest. Meanwhile, despite his promises not to take vacations as president, Trump has wasted tens of millions of dollars traveling to his own properties and golf courses. Trump\u2019s Dishonest Presidency Trump has repeatedly and blatantly lied to the American people over and over again. While he has failed to deliver on his promises or meaningfully improve the well-being of middle-class families, Trump has attempted to mislead Americans about basic facts and has tried to invent false statistics to push his unpopular policies. Trump\u2019s record of blatant dishonesty is unprecedented: He has lied to the American people more than 7,600 times so far in his presidency, an average of more than 15 times per day last year. The majority of Americans say they trust Trump less than previous presidents, and fewer than 3 in 10 Americans believe the president\u2019s most common lies. Trump\u2019s lies aren\u2019t innocent exaggerations. Trump has used misleading statistics to stoke fear about a manufactured crisis at the border, and has even lied directly to our active-duty service members and our nation\u2019s veterans. Investigations Continue To Turn Up More Trump And Russia Ties Less than four months into his presidency, Trump fired FBI Director Comey because of \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump,\u201d leading to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. As the special counsel\u2019s investigation continues to get to the bottom of links between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 and hold Trump\u2019s cronies responsible for their crimes \u2014 it is essential the investigation be protected from Trump\u2019s interference. Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop a federal investigation into Trump\u2019s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Trump fired FBI Director Comey, admitting shortly afterward that he did so because of the Russia investigation. Mueller\u2019s investigation has resulted in more than 100 criminal counts, 33 people and three companies charged, and guilty pleas from five Trump associates \u2014 so far. Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the timeline of the Trump Tower Moscow project in order to protect Trump. Trump\u2019s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was convicted at trial on eight counts related to money laundering. The next month, he pleaded guilty to two more counts in a separate trial and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigation (Mueller\u2019s office subsequently revoked the plea deal because Manafort wouldn\u2019t stop lying). Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign chairman and Manafort\u2019s longtime business partner, Rick Gates, pleaded guilty to two charges and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russians. Trump publicly emerged at the center of Mueller\u2019s investigation after being labeled \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in criminal filings, suggesting that Trump continues to be a major subject of interest in the probe. Despite Trump\u2019s frequent denials during the 2016 presidential campaign that he had any business deals in Russia, negotiations for Trump Tower Moscow continued until June 2016, well into the campaign. Trump discussed the project on multiple occasions with Michael Cohen, and Trump family members received briefings. Michael Cohen spoke with the Kremlin about the project, and the Trump Organization even planned to give Vladimir Putin a penthouse apartment in the finished tower. Nearly Everything Trump Has Ever Run Is Under Investigation Trump has a decades-long history of acting as if he were above the law. In addition to the special counsel\u2019s investigation, Trump and organizations he has run have been the subjects of fraud and corruption investigations by federal and state prosecutors, as well as party to lawsuits alleging that Trump is violating the Constitution by accepting bribe money from foreign nations. Trump was personally implicated in a hush-money scheme during the 2016 election to silence two women that alleged they had affairs with him. Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg was granted immunity by federal prosecutors to testify about Michael Cohen before a grand jury, giving prosecutors access to his unparalleled knowledge of Trump\u2019s finances. Federal prosecutors were probing whether Trump\u2019s inauguration misspent funds or accepted contributions in exchange for favors that run afoul of federal corruption laws. New York State authorities opened a probe into Trump\u2019s company following a bombshell report detailing decades of tax fraud. Civil lawsuits alleging Trump is violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause put the Trump Organization\u2019s financial records under fire. The Trump Foundation was forced to dissolve as part of an ongoing investigation by the New York Attorney General\u2019s office into Trump\u2019s years-long use of the foundation for his own benefit.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Biden could have beaten Trump. There are three reasons: Hillary was a uniquely flawed candidate. Not only did she have 30 years of political baggage, but she handled the latest \u201cscandal\u201d\u2014the emails\u2014the way she had handled the earlier ones: by covering up, lying, and denying. Destroying emails on her server and joking about them. And even having her aides physically destroy\u2014with a hammer\u2014at least two of her cell phones. It\u2019s been said\u2014and I tend to agree\u2014that Hillary is the only Democrat that Trump could have beaten.Trump was a uniquely flawed candidate. His winning message was: Change. Throw the rascals out. Drain the swamp. Make America great again. On a personal level, he\u2019s absolutely despicable. On a policy level, he\u2019s anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-Mexican, misogynistic, etc. He doesn\u2019t understand the First Amendment (nor many of the others). A large number of his votes came not from people who supported him, but from people who opposed Hillary.Biden had the knowledge and experience to govern. Yet, unlike Hillary, I doubt he would have pledged to make his administration a third term of Obama\u2019s. Biden is know for being a straight-shooter\u2014not of the sort of a Trump, but certainly far, far more honest and direct than Clinton. Add to that: Biden\u2019s last name wasn\u2019t Clinton. The biggest \u201chit\u201d on Biden\u2014and he\u2019s outgrown it\u2014is that he sometimes came across as a buffoon. Even if true, Biden\u2019s buffoonery paled in comparison to Trump\u2019s.Yes. Biden could have beaten Trump. ",

            "answer_text": "Theoretically, anyone \u201ccould\u201d have beaten Trump, but its entirely unlikely that Biden would have won the Presidency in a contest with Trump. Trump Supporters (which include Republicans, Democrats, and Independents) were in complete support of Donald Trump from early on in the campaign cycle and were not going to change their vote regardless of who the opposition candidate was. Remember, Trump did have scandalous activity that came out during the campaign that would have sunk most politicians. For example the infamous \u201cGrab them by the p*ssy.\u201d comment made to Billy Bush, or the long list of women who claimed to be assaulted by Trump. He was going to get his votes and win those states no matter who was running. Biden, on the other hand, is not nearly as well-known or well-liked as Democratic Beltway Insiders would like to believe. Plus, the mood of the election was to go with an \u2018outsider\u2019 candidate anyway - Biden is definitely an insider. Clinton couldn\u2019t shake that designation either. Hillary actually had one advantage over Biden. She\u2019s smart and skilled. Biden?? Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a Republican who was highly respected in the Obama Administration and asked to continue as Defense Sec by President Obama twice said in his book of Biden (paraphrasing) \u2018he is wrong about everything.\u2019 Senator McCain said essentially the same thing during his presidential campaign 8 years earlier. This would hurt Biden gain the support necessary for a nationwide campaign & would have given Trump wonderful grounds on which to attack him. There\u2019s also the political fact that its rare for Vice Presidents to win the Presidency. This election was a referendum on Washington. Washington is not seen as working for the majority of the country - and Trump crystalized that opposition into dogged support. He was an unstoppable force. Let\u2019s not forget there was a reason Biden did not run. Thinking he may have beaten Trump is just revisionist history at best and the Democrats being sore losers at worst. ",

His lies is his people see him saying one thing then almost immediately saying the opposite .to be brief you look at the virus . January there were deaths, trump spoke on it he said not a big deal soon be 1 to 0. Shortly after he said even one death was too many and yet he still did nothing. You have trump pushes drugs that haven't even be clinically tested yet. People see that. You look at Trump's rally he had several where he promoted violence, hatred and racism . a president supposed to bring a country together not push apart..trump several times referred to a civil war .people see that why is approval ratings are the second worst in history..bush low was way better than Trump's high..his base love talking about Democrats that is a Republican better than trump. OK next you look at the 2018 midterms Republicans lost the house cause of trump .almost every state he tried to help lost in a landslide..even the Kentucky race The republican senator lost again cause of trump . he got many people first time many didn't know what to expect . if you look at alot of stuff trump has signed and break down every aspect more bad than good..people on here did a great job breaking down his trade deal with China etc. Trump says alot of stuff that if you look at studies are way way way off.he said one thing was 90 plus percent when it was only roughly 27%. Trump is smart he knows his base won't look into what he is doing .immigrants his crutch he said they costs America roughly 67 billion annually that was a lie, it was over 130 billion they helped create..not that trump is a liar he is a horrible lying POS. People see that more clear now. Trump doesn't only have to worry about biden and his supporters. Biden will have the black votes, which trump made racist comments about , then you add Obama to mix omg..Bernie is supporting biden that will give biden the young vote and Hispanics , guess what? Trump called them murderers, rapist , breeders, the worst things you can call a race. People don't forget . then you throw bloomberg supporters in the mix plus the other former candidates..trump tried to dig up dirt on biden that back fired..biden doesn't have all the dirt Hillary did plus when Hillary failed to go to certain states trump ran there . now States biden don't attack for whatever reason Bloomberg and others will go there..trump is even losing older voters that helped him win in 2016. Trump messed up when it came to older people he said if we need to sacrifice the elderly oh well..yeah smart move..look at states he won like NC he screwed them over. He managed to screw over the same States, people he won them over. People saw now he was making things about himself . you see his answers to questions now he dances around them or lies like crazy .people see that .that idiot is done . ",

Trump will just try to keep them home and with Biden, he could very easily succeed. He\u2019ll also call Biden a socialist just for kicks too. Warren and Sanders beat Trump in a head-to-head match up in early polling and their records and vigor are much more tried and true for the current Democratic Party, in particular, with those who feel the Democratic Party has left them. Harris could possibly have a similar advantage but she\u2019ll need to do more leg work I believe. But currently, Trump is forecasted to win[1], especially if Democrats run a more moderate candidate[2]. Biden just happens to have the worst record of the moderate options.

Who are the Libertarian & Green Party candidates now?  Trump\u2019s base has not grown. If anything it will shrink due to these two primary reason - Today (6/26/2020) we had 40,371 cases of Covid-19 diagnosed on this one day, The highest daily total yet. This will become a trendThe EU is going to institute a ban on US citizen\u2019s traveling to EU countries. The EU was open about it\u2019s discussion of the US ban. Asian Nations, the Gulf Nations, and the rest of the developed word will follow the EU in less than 24 hours.Those two facts have broken America\u2019s economic engine and the markets will crash as we go into the election. Greed was a primary appeal to Trump among his base - I got mine, I don\u2019t care about ethics. Should we see the S&P begin to halve, so will the 401Ks of Trump supporters. The illusion of \u201cwinning\u201d is about to shatter. Pie in the sky rhetoric will do nothing to negate the losses many retail investor will see in the market. We will see this scenario or worse going into 2021, be it Biden or Trump.  Damage to America's global business is completely unacceptable - If Trump think's he's got tricks up his sleeve, he ain't seen nothing yet from the old school capitalist. A massive market collapse is a profit engine for big equities money - they are not in the business of buying high. For the world to take America off the pariah state list we share with Russia & Brazil, a real change in America\u2019s handling of the Pandemic has to take effect. Trump is incapable of effecting that change. He openly denies Covid-19\u2019s gravity and has proven that over & over to the rest of the world, so have his followers. The Dems need to work as if they are losing up until after election day. Trump\u2019s main tools at this point are voter suppression & denial that he lost. From the liberal left to the conservative right, we will need to March Trumpism out of the White House & the Executive Branch on 1/21/21 - don\u2019t doubt that. Double down & Triple down your efforts to insure that voter suppression is overcome. The only way for Trumpism to remain is cheating. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. I said in a previous answer that I\u2019m not going to bull sh*t you and tell you how elections are won in most states, but I do know how they\u2019re won in my state, Wisconsin.[1] I said Biden will, in all likelihood, lose Wisconsin if there\u2019s no recession. He could very well lose even if there is one. I pointed out that Tammy Baldwin (D), a progressive, had big wins here in 2012 and 2018. The first win was against a popular former Republican governor. I pointed out that centrists just keep losing here over and over again. The data\u2019s in. Centrists LOSE!!! I don\u2019t want to have to keep telling a bunch of knuckleheads that you have no clue on how elections are won here. I tried showing you pictures before, but, apparently, you\u2019re a bunch of morons. I\u2019ll just give you some of Tammy Baldwin\u2019s policies: She compares her politics to progressive hero \u201cFighting\u201d Bob La Follett, who was a Republican progressive 100 years ago long before Republicans lost their minds. In fact, the Republican Party started here, in the small town of Ripon, because they opposed slavery.She opposes all cuts to Medicare and Social Security.In 2017, she wrote an op-ed supporting Medicare for all.[2]She opposed the privatization of the US Postal ServiceShe voted against defunding ACORN.She was a vocal critic of the Iraq War.She cosponsored a bill proposing articles of impeachment against Dick Cheney and Alberto Gonzales.In 2016, she got a 32% cumulative score on \"key business votes\u201d from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and she wore that as a badge of honor.She supports antitrust action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice to do things like break up banks that are \u201ctoo big\u201d to fail.She wants the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to build more public housing.In 2006, she voted against building a fence on the U.S.-Mexico border.She wants a path to citizenship for dreamers.In 2016, she voted against Kate's Law.She\u2019s criticized US policy in Central America from a left-wing point of view.In October 2017, the editors of one of our local papers, the Capital Times, praised both her and Bernie Sanders for their vocal opposition to a budget resolution that they believed would\u2019ve increase income inequality The one thing I\u2019ll point out is she does the opposite of whatever Joe Biden does.

So were the election to take place anywhere else, Biden would completely destroy Trump\u2014 heck, even a child could defeat Trump. But this isn\u2019t anywhere else. This is America. Here is an idea of the level of education that many of our voters are at: 46% of Americans don\u2019t believe in evolution.41% of Americans believe that humans walked alongside dinosaurs.37% of Americans don\u2019t know what the First Amendment of the Constitution is about.1/5 of Americans don\u2019t believe in climate change.1/5 of Americans don\u2019t believe in vaccines.1/3 of Americans don\u2019t believe the death toll of the Holocaust.3/5 of Americans believe that dreams can tell the future.27% of Americans believe that praying to God has an effect on which team wins the Super Bowl.1/4 of Americans believe that the Sun orbits the Earth.1/5 of Americans believe Bigfoot is real.Considering all that, it\u2019s no surprise that Donald Trump won in 2016 and has a sizeable chance of winning again this year. So can Biden defeat Trump? Sure, but whether it will actually happen isn\u2019t something I would be confident betting on. And that is a very worrying thought. ",

            "answer_text": "I have always respected Joe Biden for his well-intentioned and bipartisan approach to politics. But although the President\u2019s flaws are very well chronicled, I think there are many reasons that Biden might not be able to beat him. Many of the President\u2019s critics talk about how \u201cdumb\u201d he is. He certainly is not the most gifted in an intellectual sense, but he is absolutely brilliant in all of the ways in which most of us would hope a leader wouldn\u2019t be. He is unconstrained by traditional rules of conduct, scruples or ethics, and he has an innate grasp of political showmanship. He is careful to project forcefulness, especially in situations where it is most unnecessary to do so (such as press briefings). In a distinctive way he is the most media-savvy President since Ronald Reagan, and this understanding enables him to control virtually any situation in front of a camera. And his lack of intellectual curiosity can give him a peculiar yet particular confidence derived from having no perceived need to question any of his thoughts. For better or worse, he is an adept salesman. These characteristics present a malevolent yet challenging skill set for an opposing candidate to counteract. We are seeing the results of this during the current pandemic. Despite a litany of well-chronicled misstatements as the pandemic began, a large portion of the country is now convinced that 83,000 deaths in two months is a \u201csuccess story.\u201d He is encouraging the country to reopen despite a still-increasing curve of cases in many states, bolstered by his ability to act as though the virus is already behind us. He introduced \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d an effort to sell the notion of a vaccine within six months, when most scientists believe it will take a year or more. And in a short space of a couple of minutes he asserted \u201cthe vaccine will be ready,\u201d \u201cnot everyone will want a vaccine,\u201d \u201cwe might not need a vaccine if the virus disappears,\u201d and \u201cwith or without a vaccine, we\u2019re back.\u201d His supporters therefore have the option of picking and choosing from a vast menu of things they might really want to hear. And these statements, combined with the attributes I described earlier, have created an unshakable devotion provided by his adoring base. For those of us who are accustomed to the polished communication skills and logical, predictable thought processes of prior leaders, we might wonder what propelled him to the Presidency. But for his supporters, his approach is absolutely intoxicating and generates tremendous amounts of loyalty. This is a large part of the reason that many of the President\u2019s supporters believe him over experts such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is one of the nation\u2019s most revered and credentialed public health experts. And a contributing factor is that some of these supporters would probably question the value of \u201cexperts\u201d anyway, even during a pandemic. Despite an abysmal response to the pandemic and a sudden, Depression-level economy, the President continues to generate a visceral, emotional reaction that serves him well. And because of his lack of character-related constraints, he might have a variety of cunning upcoming tactics at his disposal that the Biden campaign has not even considered. Therefore the Democratic Party needs to be aware that any traditional \u201crules\u201d under which it is operating might not be acknowledged, or could even be repudiated, by the President. For all of these reasons, the President remains a formidable candidate and incumbent. The Democratic Party underestimates him at their peril. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe. There are indications that he will. However, there seems to be a few things that are starting to come into play that might change that, and they are: Biden is considered by many to be cognitively impaired because of his gaffes, inability to remember facts, inability to respond to reporter questions effectively, and so on.Biden doesn\u2019t look physically healthy.Kamala Harris may be more of a hindrance than a positive factor because, despite what she says, she is very far left in her politics. She\u2019s a product of far left radical San Francisco and Oakland, California conditioning since birth.Both, despite trying to appeal to moderates, are starting to show cracks in their professed rhetoric and their true politics of radically left thinking is starting to be revealed.Some are realizing that a vote for Biden/Harris means far more country debt into the trillions, major tax increases, more laws, open borders, enfranchising about 15 to 20 million illegals so they can vote Democrat, making those illegally crossing the boarder citizens upon arrival and entitled to all tax payer incentives, and so on. Plus higher cost of gas prices because of return to reliance on foreign imports, more costly goods and services, and so on.There\u2019s more. But despite some moderates being under the illusion that their leaders are as they are, moderate, they are starting to learn that probably isn\u2019t so. Most Democrat politicians, including Biden and Harris, have given into some of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders\u2019 socialist ideas. While most Democrats, including Moderates, hate Trump because they have given in to the propaganda of the continued bashing by the liberal media that controls the United States and the leaders in the Democratic Party, they have to decide. Is the price of Democrat radicalism too high a price to pay just to get rid of Trump? We\u2019ll have to see how all of this plays out in November 2020. It might just be a tighter race than anyone now believes. ",

            "answer_text": "-Trump has a 95% approval rating among Republicans. People keep talking about a divide in the Republican party (At least the media and establishment Democrats). What divide? The modern day Republican party has never been more united behind a president as Trump. -Young people turnout (Who heavily vote Democratic) have been dismal, which cost Sanders a projected win in ST (Of course Klobuchar and Buttigieg had something to do with that as well). Young people heavily vote for democrats. If they don\u2019t even show up for the primaries for someone they heavily support, what makes you think they\u2019ll go out for someone they don\u2019t like nearly as much (*Cough* Biden). -There will be a fractured Democratic party this year. Sanders supporters are passionate not about the Democratic party but Bernie Sanders. If he\u2019s not the nominee, they won\u2019t come out to vote for the nominee. That\u2019s factual too. A poll showed that only above 50% of Sanders supporters will definitely support the nominee if it\u2019s not Sanders. The rest either said no or it depended on the nominee and I don\u2019t think Biden is necessarily the nominee they\u2019re talking about. -Biden\u2019s primary has been loaded with scandals, gaffes and a clear case of dementia. If he\u2019s this out of it in the primary, think of how he\u2019ll be when he\u2019s on the debate stage with Trump. Polls are polls. They change. Polls showing Biden up 4 in Florida or up 6 in Pennsylvania NOW are pretty useless. Trump\u2019s in a better position in polls NOW than he was against Clinton in 2016 at this point in the election cycle. He\u2019s not even out campaigning yet and that\u2019s what he does best. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a blowout and I think at times it\u2019ll be a nail-biter but Trump\u2019s clearly the favorite. ",

            "answer_text": "I really don\u2019t know. No one else does, either. Here\u2019s the thing, though: we now have incontrovertible proof of what happens when you sit out the election because your preferred candidate didn\u2019t get the nomination. I expect Democrats to go very hard on the message of supporting whoever won the nomination. Biden\u2019s numbers have shrunk somewhat, but a he retains a base of support that is not much more likely to be moved by his gaffes than Trump voters were moved by his talk of grabbing women by their private parts. (\u201cTake him seriously, but don\u2019t take him literally\u2026!\u201d) Biden is likely to put in a mediocre showing in Iowa and New Hampshire, then crush it in South Carolina. His supporters will take this as evidence that he can go the distance. I don\u2019t think Biden\u2019s chances of beating Trump have much to do with his gaffes or even whether there are questions about his faculties. Firstly and assuming that he wins the nomination (not a foregone conclusion), he has to pick the right running mate. His pick has to reassure the voters that someone they would want to have as acting POTUS is waiting in the number two slot if age catches up with Biden during his term. I think this person is Kamala Harris, but I\u2019m open to arguments about other candidates. Provided he makes the right choice, any concerns voters may have about Biden\u2019s age will be greatly diminished. Secondly, Biden simply has to keep reminding voters of everything that has turned out sourly during the Trump Administration. Between tweets, farming losses, the costs of the trade war, and his refusal to abide by separation of powers, there\u2019s plenty of material to choose from. Biden\u2019s target audience isn\u2019t going to be people who stopped watching Fox because Fox got too liberal. He\u2019s going to be after the Obama-Trump voters. That\u2019s who he needs. These are people who don\u2019t care what the Dow Jones is doing because there\u2019s nothing in the Dow Jones for them. These are people who will have noticed that their staples from China are more expensive than they used to be. These are people who will have noticed that manufacturing is shedding jobs in key states in direct response to the trade war. They voted for Trump to change things up, and a lot of them are no better off for it. Content that their voices have been heard at last, they can afford to be receptive to the message that Trump had the right idea about fixing the trade problem with China but that a Biden Administration will address the problem with due concern for the well-being of the average American wage earner. Of course, we don\u2019t know that Biden will even get the nomination. Super Tuesday will tell us a lot more. Until then, it\u2019s a lot of guesswork. ",

Trump has been a blundering, bumbling self-obsessed narcissist who really didn't care for any sliver of American divisions. He was an outsider who rides the stupidity of the GOP who thought they could bust this loose cannon, and use the presidency to feed their pockets and agendas. But this boy is just interested in lining his pockets and feed his ego that's starved and needs constant approval. Poor boy, he's just dropped his Ice cream on the pavement and expects sympathy, lick it up boy your bullying and crying Victim has run sour and everyone can see the big bully that's been taken to the back of the class and spanked by his nemesis, and that without that Biden boy having lifted a finger.

That doesn\u2019t mean Trump can\u2019t or won\u2019t win, just that it is less likely than Joe Biden winning. People are REALLY bad at probabilities. Trump is slightly more likely to win reelection than flipping a coin twice in a row and getting two heads. People when it comes to politics tend to look at probabilistic models and assume a 70% chance to win equates to a 70% share of the vote which is false. If a candidate was projected to get 70% of the vote they would be all but certain to win the presidency. There are good models out there. I like FiveThirtyEight who will give you an overview of the methodology they use to develop a probability of the two major candidates to win the Presidency. Trump currently sits at about a 1 and 3 chance of retaining office which is about the same as his chances as of election day 2016. If we make the math easy and say Trump's odds of election in 2016 were 1 in 3 and his odds in 2020 are 1 and 3 that would mean as of November 1st, 2016 Trump would have had a 1 in 9 chance of being a two-term president which is roughly 11%. Nobody gets surprised when something with an 11% chance of happening does. Look at it this way. The best hitters in baseball get hits roughly 1 in 3 plate appearances, but nobody is surprised when it happens. So if you want Trump to win consider it about as likely as a good baseball hitter getting a hit on any given AB. ",

Those things don't keep me employed, benfit my retirement or food on the table. They simply dont benefit anyone who is gainfully employed and has employer sponsered healthcare. The numbers don't add up and the increased taxes would be far more than I pay now witj no return. Tax the shit out of us to go green with renewable energy? Again, does not benefit me just my raises cost of living. You say the world will end in 10 years? I have been hearing that for 30 years. It is possible we will see some issues in 50 years but I will be dead and gone but more importantly the technology will hopefully be available make cheap renewable energy a viable option. What if the world does end in 10 years? It is a chance I am willing to take to avoid living in a one bedroom apartment eating cat food when i can no longer work. It would be the end of my world anyway. Whoever the dems nominate is going to have to connect with people like me. We are the silent majority. How will electing someone who is running on social issues help us? As far as in can tell most people are thriving. Even if your don't like Trump you are certainly benefiing from the ecomomic boom. Even if his policies are not responsible for the windfall the market loves the guy. The perception of him pushed the market though the roof and there it has stayed. What possible reason would we have to fuck that up? Social programs cost money and tax the rich isn't even going to put a dent the bill. It will all come down to the 1% rich and 49% of the working class who pay taxes are going to have to to cover the 50% who do not.Redistrubuton of wealth by social program is not in my best interest.

If he had run in 2016, he would have crushed Trump, though the death of his son is a pretty good reason not to run for president, so I understand. Biden might have some problems on the campaign trail, seeing how he is quite old and the Democrats seem to be trending in a younger direction, which I think is good. But, if he runs and gets the nomination, I`ll have a lot more faith in him than even some other Democrats, as he was a senator and VP. Trump just hasn`t done anything to give me faith in him. The guy is disrespectful, whether it`s to foreign leaders or to the military, doesn`t seem to know how government works, and thinks bullying people is the way to get people to do what he wants. That is not a healthy or constructive way to govern, and he is every stereotype of the ugly American. His tax cut did not go to the people who need it the most, and taxes will rise next year as the IRS adjusts for inflation. Other than that, Trump really has nothing he can take credit for other than trying to screw people out of healthcare. We need someone in office who is going to bat for all Americans, not just those who voted for him. We need someone who understands that for society and the American people to prosper, everyone needs to have affordable healthcare, relative job security, a living wage, and we need to get serious about climate change again. America does not live in its own world, and we can`t pretend we do; we will rot. Also, I confess it`s a little bit personal: I live overseas currently and was traveling for much of the last two years. All I hear about is Trump and what-about-this and why-is-it-like-this and I just want to be treated as a citizen of the world again, not some alien who crash-landed here. I hope other Democrats and liberals see it this way, and don`t sit on their hands because whoever is the nominee didn`t say that all transgender people are legally demigods or something. ",

When one candidate has something akin to a double digit lead, it means a major majority in the electoral college. Don\u2019t count your chickens til they\u2019re hatched, but I\u2019d say Biden is heading for a major win over the Trumpster. Trump is simply doubling down on his losing strategy of ignoring the covid-19 pandemic and just trying to rouse his base with the usual racist and law and order messaging. It\u2019s not working. According to a recent FOX news poll, Biden is up 9 points on Trump in Florida, is up 2 points on Trump in Georgia and North Carolina and is up 1 point on Trump in Texas. Now if Texas, Georgia and North Carolina are all really in play like that, Trump is sinking badly \u2014 even if he sqeaks through in those three states. He\u2019s not going to recover from being down 9 points in Florida \u2014 a must-win state for Trump. Trump beat Clinton by 13 points among people 65 and over in 2016. As of now Biden is ahead of Trump by 9 points with Seniors. That\u2019s a decline of 22 points for the Trumpster. And this has to do probably with Trump\u2019s total incompetence about the covid-19 epidemic \u2014 which Trump now just wants to try to ignore. Believe me, I\u2019m not a Biden fan. I won\u2019t vote for either of these candidates. But Trump is cruisin\u2019 for a bruisin\u2019. ",

Biden summoned high turnout from precisely the diverse constituencies of African Americans, suburbanites, working-class and older voters the Dems count on. It is a proven winning formula. Sanders plan to win by bringing in young people and previous nonvoters was a wet firecracker on Super Tuesday. In many Super Tuesday states, Dem primary turnout was either up or way up from 2016. Its not the bland Dem field that has enflamed Dem turnout, it is Trump! From the Stormy Daniels scandal to Hurricane Maria, children in cages, Charlottesville, Helsinki, the Mueller Report fiasco, impeachment to Trump's bungled covid19 stupidity: America is sick of that idiot. Joe Biden is a nice guy with a million watt smile. Super Tuesday suggested that American voters yearn for those old days of public decorum, government by policy (not by the publicity stunt du jour), and a serious, perspicacious, and literate president instead of a sloppy, obnoxious freakshow carnival barker. Trump has no communications director. He will continue to bumble and stumble, bloviate and bullshit, and get mad at everybody. ON TOP OF ALL THAT: the stock market continues toward its doom. ",

Even though Biden isn\u2019t as widely disliked as Hillary Clinton. He is still very much part of the same establishment that the American populace seem to have found a voice against. The people\u2019s mandate from the past election clearly shows that Americans want an America that works for Americans first. Which if you really think about it is a very fair thing to ask of your government. The USA is without a doubt the most prosperous country in the world. But this prosperity doesn\u2019t trickle down into the lives of most Americans. The income gap within America is massive. This however isn\u2019t the problem America has with its establishment(people who\u2019ve been part of governance for years). The problem is the apathy shown towards this problem. Especially in the face of pro-immigration policies democrats have sworn by for years. Truth be told home grown Americans are today at a disadvantage when compared to some outside immigrants in certain areas because of certain policy issues. Democrats instead of realizing this obvious failing have resorted to vilifying their dissenters as racists. Isolating themselves further from these estranged voter groups. If the democrats realize their duty to their voters(Cause they are a country first) and listen to their countrymen defeating Donald Trump should be a breeze. Especially now after all the blunders under his administration(corona-virus pandemic, response to BLM protest). But this calculated tight rope strategy is in my opinion inviting trouble.

I am concerned about Warren or Harris being torn apart for being east and West Coast \u201cLiberals\u201d (I like them both) Biden understands how government works and has a very good reputation in the house and senate.

            "answer_text": "Trump is literally the worst choice imaginable. Almost everyone has at least something going for them. Trump doesn\u2019t. He is the perfect example of bad president and by extension a bad human. Some people may be naive, but well-meaning. Carter would have been a good example of this. Trump is not well-meaning; he is actively trying to hurt others as much as possible. Trump may be evil but smart. Kissinger would be a good example of this. Trump is very stupid however. He is functionally illiterate and can barely speak. He\u2019s been called unbelievably stupid by people who were working close with him. Trump may be not be a great politician but perhaps he was a good businessman. This is one of his selling points as well, after all. However, his track record only shows failed ventures and bankruptcies. Trump may not be smart, or well-meaning in general, or a good business man, but perhaps he is a good family-man. That\u2019s not exactly enough to be a good president, but at least it would be something. However, he\u2019s only shown a lack of interest in their development and in fact he has a history of sexual abuse. He speaks in sexual ways about his children and has multiple allegations of sexual abuse against him. Trump may be a bad guy, but at least he has some sense of loyalty towards his friends. However, it\u2019s very clear that he turns against anyone the moment he can benefit in doing so. I\u2019ve even heard it said that the comparison of Trump to a mob boss is unfair because mob bosses have more integrity. I could go on, but it is literally impossible to say anything good about him. There isn\u2019t a single thing in his life that he didn\u2019t do just to benefit himself at the expense of others. His list of crimes and other immoral behaviour is so long it\u2019s impossible to list it all. In fact, he doesn\u2019t just hurt others because it benefits him, he actually enjoys hurting others. He has incited violence multiple times \u2014 he won\u2019t do it himself since he\u2019s too much of a coward for that \u2014 just for the sake of it. Trump is one of the vilest creatures on this planet who should be in jail. If it\u2019s X vs. Trump, for any X, X is better than Trump. ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt it. Biden is in mental decline. Watch a YouTube video of all of his gaffes, but do so through the lens of psychological fitness. He has already, while on the campaign trail, forgotten what state he was in. I think that Biden may be on the brink of a full cognitive breakdown. If it happens in public, then he\u2019s done. Currently, he has the full support of the machine. Bloomberg\u2019s money, powerful endorsements, and an electorate who seem to think they\u2019re voting for Biden 2012. But none of that will matter if he can\u2019t string his thoughts together during a debate against Trump. His campaign will be planning to limit his public appearances. My prediction is that the upcoming CNN debate with Sanders will be cancelled and that we\u2019ll be told it is due to Coronavirus. The big story on Super Tuesday was Biden\u2019s stellar performance. But even during his victory speech, he mistook his wife for his sister. A seemingly innocuous error, in any other setting. But with Biden, these moments of confusion do not happen in a vacuum. I hope that, whoever the nominee is, they find a way to beat Trump. Biden\u2019s viability will depend on his mind holding up until November. I expect he\u2019ll tap Kamala Harris to be his VP pick. She damn well better be ready to lead the country on day one. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a little too far out to say that I would definitively vote for Trump. I didn\u2019t vote for him last time. I picked a third party candidate running as a conservative in my state. There were several reasons I didn't vote for him the first time around. Some of those reasons haven\u2019t changed, and I don\u2019t expect them to change between now and 2020, such as questionable moral character and his narcissistic immaturity. The other reasons I didn\u2019t vote for him had to do with lack of experience and even a basic understanding of how our government works; and, I was uncertain of how he would govern and whether he would actually implement the conservative policies he ran on. I also wasn\u2019t sure he really wanted the job and would take it seriously. I think he was really surprised he won. Well, in 2020 he will have plenty of experience being president. He has been totally engaged in the job and he is in my opinion one of the more successful presidents at actually keeping his promises thus far. So, it will come down to how he acts between now and then and whether there is some credible scandal that comes out (other than another porn star). I expect him to be Trumpy between now and then, so that will probably not keep me from voting for him. He\u2019s pulled it off so far, and I actually like that he speaks his mind and doesn\u2019t put up with political correctness and crap from the media. He\u2019ll have to go beyond where he\u2019s been in his behavior to lose my vote. As far as Biden, I don\u2019t think I would vote for him because I couldn\u2019t see myself voting for a democrat. There are too many areas we would disagree. However, if I were ever to vote for a democrat, he would be the kind of person I could possibly consider pulling the lever for because he seems to be a classic liberal. These days someone like him is pretty centrist in the democrat party. If he does run, though, I would expect that he would be pulled much farther to the left in his promises and policies. That would be too bad, because I think a classic liberal would have a chance with democrat voters who are liberal but not leftists. ",

            "answer_text": "The thing to remember is that the two men are of vastly different backgrounds.Biden was a tough talking politician who had all but passed his best when Senator Obama chose him as his running in 2008. Obama had no special skills but became the darling of the left primarily because of his color. A fact emphisised when the nobel committee immediately awarded him the coveted peace price. A fact even he could not understand. Biden was however a smart choice as VP ,he was a moderate democrat and was well known. At this time Donald Trump was a popular game show host and billionaire property developer. Although always a republican supporter he frequently was courted by both parties for donations. In this he was no different to many other well heeled buisinessmen . By 2016 The Obama presidency was in freefall. His administration had accumulated more debt than all other US presidents combined. He openly admitted that all the manufacturing jobs lost under his administration would not be coming back. Stating it would take a magic wand. When Trump entered the race he was dismissed,his critics pointing out he had zero experience and had talked about running on several previous occasions. I was one of those detractors ,having been appointed by the Ben Carson Campaign as county coordinator for Montgomery County Kentucky ,i threw what weight i had behind Carson. When he dropped out members of the GOP here in my area asked if i would now support Trump who was leading in the polls. I declined and watched from the sidelines as he pulled ahead of the opposition and gained the nomination. I then began to listen to his speeches .There is no doubt that Trump is unique in US presidential candidates. He quickly gained popularity by promoting traditional american values and ridiculing political correctness. Looking at his record as president since his election his success has been staggering. Despite Obamas warnings Trump has restored millions of jobs and reduced unemployment to record levels. In the case of black and hispanics it is the lowest in recorded history. His regular rallies held in major cities have broken records with thousands queing outside the venues unable to get inside. He has rebuilt the military and strengthend our border, he is rebuilding the border fence at an almost unheard of rate. finally after being advised by his predessessor that North Korea presented the greatest threat ,he engaged with them and de-escalated the conflict opening direct talks with that country and its leader. All of these policies have enraged the left who realising they cannot regain the support of the American people have launced an all out war on him ,both legally politically and physically. He has endured unprecedented attacks from the left and their compliant media. Yet today his popularity continues to soar. In Biden , America sees a reminder of the chaos under Obama ,and the massive unemployment and civil unrest .They see a brighter future in Trump. I fear that the left have destroyed themselves as a credible opposition party which is not a good thing. Ever presidents administration needs a balanced but loyal opposition who support the country and its people. Without such a balance the door is open for a dictstorship down the road. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the most important things to know about a candidate is his/her intents. That\u2019s not always easy to understand particularly if a candidate has changed behaviors and positions over the years. You can guess about some of a candidate\u2019s intents by what he/she has accomplished, what they are doing now and what they say, but a candidate can have secret intents which he/she hides. All the presidential candidates have the selfish intent to gain power but some also have altruistic intents. Other candidates say they are altruistic but that may just be a show to get elected. Their hidden intent is to gain glory for their ego. It is hard to say. Joe Biden seems to have good intents which balance out his ego. I can\u2019t see anything that would make me concerned about an out-of-control ego. The same can\u2019t be said about Donald Trump. He is very, very self centered. Yet he has accomplished a lot and, if you are a conservative, you won\u2019t object to his big ego. But he worries me. Where he is \u201cleading\u201d the country is uncertain at least in my mind. No one is following in his footsteps. Hmmmm? A leader with zero followers. That can\u2019t be right. Donald Trump is a master without followers. He has a huge number of people who serve him. They bow to his power and personality. He is the republican\u2019s MASTER. If Donald Trump wants to unite all the superpowers in a consortium that rules the world, no one thinks that except for me but I am not deceived by the show he puts on. I doubt very much that he is against the president of China. That could be a show and when he meets Xi, they may be putting on a show while plotting their personal ambitions. One of the reasons I think this is because Trump and Comey have been putting on a show of hate. Yet Comey won the election for Trump. That should have made Comey his best friend (BFF). I don\u2019t buy their show. You might note that the Trump/Comey show doesn\u2019t do anything damaging. In fact the show manipulates and focuses public opinion on the two men. Of course I could be wrong but the Trump risk far, far outweighs the potential gain. If my SPECULATION has an ounce of merit, Trump is the biggest threat to this country since the civil war. Be wary and smart. The risk is enormous with Trump but not with Biden. On the other hand, I think Biden is too weak to be president. ",

Of course, the swing states could go either way and, most likely, both Trump and Biden will win some of them. In the end, however, I think Biden\u2019s moderate position will attract enough Republicans to beat Trump. Taking all that into consideration, I think the map will most likely turn out like this:  ",

Here's a secret the polling isnt making clear: if you take a group of people who love their candidate and a group of people who instead hate the other parties candidate, on election day, there will be more of the people who want to vote for someone than people who want to vote against someone who show up and vote.

The disrespect of everyone; all women in general, his wives, his kids, Americans that have sacrificed for their country, disabled persons, and the list goes on. Hates illegal immigration but hires illegal immigrants for his benefit. Creates a charitable foundation, then uses the funds for himself (that stupid f\u2026ing painting of himself). Continues to use his position to profit financially. Fails to pay his sub-contractors. Takes a casino into bankruptcy; how the hell do you do that? Then the Pandemic. This one needs no explanation. I\u2019ve been sitting here for a half hour trying to decide which points about this are the most important. I decided that all of the lack of leadership and intentional misleading and outright lying are all exemplified by over 200,000 deaths and continuing to grow at a scary rate as we come back inside for the winter.

            "answer_text": "Okay, this question is offensive, it requires so much unpacking. You\u2019re assuming Biden is going to usurp the DNC primary nomination, despite growing, and increasingly mounting evidence to the contrary. Joe Biden apparently can\u2019t make it through a single debate or function without putting his foot in his mouth. Robin Williams made fun of him in his 2009 comedy special for this inability to articulate himself in any presentable fashion. Joe Biden resorts to defending his \u201cbussing\u201d record against attacks from Kamala Harris using the exact same \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d argument exhibited by Barry Goldwater to defend himself from accusations of racism when he opposed the Civil Rights Act. Joe Biden has deliberately been shielded from Elizabeth Warren on both the MSNBC and CNN debates and then they had the nerve to tell you that the debate night selections for first and second rounds on each channel were \u201crandom.\u201d Biden is being protected by neoliberal corporatist interests because they\u2019re infinitely aware that the more you\u2019re forced to watch him on a level playing field\u2026the more it will occur to you that he\u2019s a duckturd who needs to be replaced by someone with something more to offer than name recognition. After Biden implodes, the corporatists will then try to sell you on Harris or Booker\u2026as they\u2019re trying to protect them from Warren on the debate stages too. It appears that the poll numbers indicate they are slowly failing at that task.You\u2019re assuming that Trump will make it to the general election. I have to assume that you\u2019re either a Democrat or an independent on the basis of your implied fear of Trump. And you should, to a certain extent, dread his continued incumbency. But the fact of the matter is\u2026now Walsh is challenging him, baiting other Republicans to challenge him\u2026Bill Weld has sustained a luke-warm primary challenge against him\u2026and no sitting incumbent President has entertained a primary challenger since President Carter. The difference, of course, is that even Carter didn\u2019t have unfavorables (57% will NOT vote for Trump under any circumstance) quite like Trump in \u201979 or \u201880. I didn\u2019t necessarily agree with it a week ago, but it is entirely possible that a narcissist of the Tangerine Caligula\u2019s degree will chose the humiliation of bowing out\u2026rather than dealing with the ignominy of a general election humiliation or even worse\u2026being unseated by a dark horse.Short answer: it will, in almost all mathematical certainty, overblown fears of the 2016 election notwithstanding\u2026be some Democrat who assumes office in January 2021. And it may very well be a corporatist hack like Harris, as the prostitutes at MSNBC (with the exception of Maddow) and CNN are working to ensure. But the likelihood that it will be a simple-Simon binary choice between Biden or the Tangerine Caligula is quite low. ",

Priceless. However, Joe Biden really has very little chance of winning. Over the past 4 years, the Dems have succeeded in lighting a slow, fat, white-hot flame of anger which will translate into a Trump tsunami at the polling booth. Joe needs to disentangle himself from antifa, BLM, JVP, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, threat of defunding police, the dem-liberal sanctuary city debacle and CAIR to have any chance of finishing with respect in November.

Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s the ONLY Democrat who could take Trump. For awhile, the polls had Elizabeth Warren losing to Trump, but now she seems to have caught up and gone ahead. Other polls show Bernie Sanders, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttagieg all beating Trump sometimes or at least running pretty close to him. I suspect that that would be true of many Democrats if people actually knew who they were. But nobody is doing polls of head-to-head matchups of Trump vs. anyone who\u2019s currently only got the support of 0\u20131% of the Democratic candidates.

Biden literally worked with segregationists like Strom Thurmond, and wrote Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill which led to a massive increase in mass incarceration, which we all know mostly impacts black people and other people of color. Trump only cares about the wealthy? One of the first things Biden did after announcing his 2020 run was tell a group of wealthy donors \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d under a Biden presidency. Trump wants to cut entitlements? Biden has a 40 year history of trying to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Deportations?

If that\u2019s not enough there is the big tech with their social blocking any articles that benefit Trump and it appears that messing with the search results to hide anything that benefits Trump and showing whatever favors Biden. Saying that however I believe that Biden is going to loose. You can see it at his rallies. It look like a bunch of government employees that are afraid to loose their jobs if they don\u2019t show up. Trump\u2019s rallies are a different thing. They are full with excitement and overcrowded. I think his big business supporters were able to eliminate such a exciting or young candidates but it is a different story with Trump.

Trump turned down WHO\u2019s offer of test kits that have proven effective in the rest of the world. Why? Right now we need to be testing 25 million people a day, give or take\u2014that\u2019s the level of testing being done in countries tackling this pandemic effectively, such as South Korea, Taiwan and Germany. His daily posturing as he hijacks coronavirus presentations to campaign for re-election while doing nothing to marshal America\u2019s resources, instead telling the states they\u2019re on their own. The rest of the world is dumbfounded. Biden knows what to do\u2014he\u2019s been through this with ebola under Obama. Here again Trump\u2019s complete lack of relevant life experience shows. His voter wanted an amateur in the White House. Well, they got it.  ",

Mr. Sanders made concerted efforts but his appeal failed to take sufficient roots beyond his base. Mr Biden, however, won the state of South Carolina and proved that the state would\u2019ve chosen anyone but Mr Sanders as this is the first state which Biden has won in the three times he has run for the presidency in 32 years. Addressing whether he could take on Trump, Mr Biden has not been any better of a candidate since launching his campaign. He has been a terrible debater and his campaigns and rallies have not been influential or imaginative to say the least. He's faced some headwinds when it comes to his conduct towards girls and women. Moreover, he played a substantial role in rallying Democrats in supporting the disastrous Iraq War. Biden\u2019s campaign has its\u2019s basis on electability and does not necessarily present a new vision for America. Mr. Biden won the nomination by not being Sanders; but not being Trump may not be enough to seal the deal in November said Gary Younge in the Hindu. Mr Trump\u2019s base remains staunch as ever and Mr Biden has to take on him by being everything he is not and at the earliest. ",

Trump has done a lot for the country but many don\u2019t like some of the things he has done. Biden has done next to nothing the whole time he has been in government. Trump has improved the economy and wages. Biden will provide workers with even higher wages by having the government hire everyone. Trump is a terrible public speaker. Biden is a pretty smooth talker and only has problems remembering where he is, what he wanted to say and what office he is running for. Trump had the economy humming before the virus creating a worker shortage that drove up wages. Biden will drive wages even higher but they will be wages in China. ",

I understand that people don\u2019t like trump, and in many ways I understand it. However, when I look at Joe Biden, I do not see a healthy man. He is stumbling over his words and showing signs of just not being all there. If it was one or two flubs, I would understand. But they were more than just one or two. I\u2019m willing to give Joe Biden the benefit of the doubt and say that as far as I understand it he is a decent man who cares about his country. But somebody\u2019s love of their country is not the only thing to measure somebody on. It\u2019s also not fair to measure him simply by the fact that he is not Donald Trump. I think it is wrong to take a man who is obviously unwell and try to put him in what is one of the most stressful jobs on the planet simply because people don\u2019t like the other guy. I don\u2019t think he will be able to drawl the passion and energy necessary to put up a fight, and honestly I think he should be allowed to go home and live out the rest of his days in peace. I don\u2019t like this at all. I don\u2019t like how The Democratic Party went from being the party that was going to support diverse change in our country and they picked the oldest whitest and sickest man they could put forward. This is not a man who will have the capacity to create that change they so desire. ",

Trump is going to mock him and he's not going to let him act like Obama was a good president therefore I'll be one too. Trump has way to much momentum to be stopped he's to much of a Savage. Biden is an old school civil Democrat trump is a mud slinging hedonist. And he's old he needs some Adderall to keep him sharp up there and his eye might start bleeding again. Where as trumps like a diesel truck you can't kill him he'll be eating McDonald's on his death bed and drinking a coke. I don't see Biden winning. ",

One poll had him leading by as much as eighteen points in Michigan. None of this really matters, though. The election is still months away. Everything could change between now and then. After all, Hillary Clinton was leading in the polls right up until the election itself. Almost everyone assumed that Clinton was going to win. Ultimately, she did win the popular vote, but she lost in the electoral college, so Donald Trump became president. We should not assume that Biden will win. Even with his high ranking in the polls, it is still highly probable that Biden will lose. We don\u2019t want a repeat of 2016. If you don\u2019t want four more years of this national nightmare, vote for Joe Biden in November. It\u2019s true that Biden isn\u2019t very progressive, but, whatever he is, he\u2019s a million times better than Trump.

            "answer_text": "Not only can he, he will. Trump is done, currently the largest campaign contributer and political commercial maker against trump is another Republican group, the Lincoln Project. Biden is just sitting there allowing everything to get into place before launching his main attacks. He is already out polling Trump in every battleground state, and what should be solidly red states are now purple. There is another factor as well, the semi rise of Jo Jorgenson, the libertarian canadate for president. while she is pulling of a democratic voter here and there, many of my friends that were former Trump supporters are now on the Jo Jo train. She is safely draining 4 or 5 Trump supporters for every Biden supporter she picks up. Biden will start in earnest once the VP pick is confirmed, so early to mid August. This gives an appropriate amount of time prior to the election to pick up steam and combat Trump head on. Trump isn\u2019t facing Clinton, isn\u2019t an unknown candidate, and is on line to be the 4th worst president ever. It will not be long from now (early july), when Republican Senatorial and House candidates read the writing on the wall and attempt a major break with Trump publicly. Once this happens the floodgates are open. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWould Joe Biden make a better president than President Trump?\u201d Thank you for asking. This question could provoke a complicated answer. Does the question imply whether the person answering likes Joe Biden over Donald Trump? How do we define better? Do I answer as a woman? As an Israeli? As a Russian? As a bigot? As a Capitalist? As a Christian? As a citizen of the world? I dislike Biden less than Trump. I would vote for Biden over Trump. However, that is different than endorsing Biden.Both Biden and Trump oppose the rights of Palestine and Palestinians; and I dislike them both equally for that.Both Biden and Trump support Israel. That has been against American interest since 1948. AIPAC does not stand for American interest.Russia supports Trump over Biden (at least Putin does). To paraphrase Mohammed Ali about the Vietnamese, I have no bones to pick with Putin or Russians.As a Capitalist, without a moment's hesitation, I find Trump the worst ever president; therefore, I would choose Biden. (However, I find the myth of free markets and Capitalism severely flawed. I am no Marxist but read Picketty's Capital in the 21st Century; inequality threatens society worse than climate change. Unregulated financial instruments can cause exponentially more harm than the Hydrogen bomb.)Choosing between Trump and Biden is like choosing between terminal cancer and a severe malady (like Ebola or small pox or venereal disease). You can manage and prevent Ebola and maybe even find a vaccine or cure for it. However, choosing Ebola over cancer, the lesser of two evils, still recognizes the evil in Ebola.I dislike Trump. I believe Trump represents an authentic version of America that many wish to deny. I admire Obama (yes, the question asks about Biden). However, Obama deported more people than all prior presidents combined, Obama signed off on all drone assassinations, Obama created the mess in Libya, Obama left 8 million foreclosed homes without relief, Obama left over a trillion dollars worth of students' loans undischarged in bankruptcy court; and Biden was his vice-president. America confronts a deep seated political dilemma that is tolerated only because enough money remains on the table to distract the people. Yes, I would vote for Biden over Trump any time. It is not an endorsement though. ",

            "answer_text": "Vice President Biden doesn\u2019t seem as if he can handle the stresses of the job. Nothing he has said inspires confidence, and when he hassles his own supporters in town hall meetings, that is not a good thing. President Trump, for all his perceived lack of presidential demeanor, has achieved just about all of the objectives he laid out 4 years ago. And that is in the face of incessant attempts from members of Congress (the House, in particular) to undermine his administration and to reverse the results of the 2016 election. Allow me to remind you how difficult it was for most of us small business owners when President Obama was in the White House. I had already been in business for decades, but when the \u201cRecovery\u201d from the Great Recession dragged on and on, year after year, many of my colleagues lost their businesses, their homes, and their livelihoods. Several of my buddies from the farmers\u2019 markets went bankrupt, and really did lose their farms. We were able to get through the previous 5 or 6 recessions since the 1970\u2019s because the period of recovery was immediate and because of legislation that stimulated the economy. But not this last time. Throw in misguided initiatives like Cash for Clunkers and the Stimulus Program, and you have someone more intent on manipulating the market place rather than doing anything to encourage businesses to offer those \u201cShovel Ready Jobs\u201d. For any politician to utter the words, \u201cJust hire people. What\u2019s so hard about that?\u201d, divulges an absolute misunderstanding of how the economy works. Businesses hire people and expand their operations when it is in their financial interests to do so. Not because they want to give people jobs. Business owners are not obligated to hire people; they do so when it will be profitable for them. When Trump became president and lowered taxes significantly for individuals and for businesses, we saw the greatest building boom that I have ever seen. Surely you\u2019ve seen it where you live. Incredible. Wish I were still in business. And that\u2019s the whole point, the main difference between the two parties. One wants to raise taxes to fund their pet programs, essentially buying votes and promising all sorts of \u201cprogressive\u201d plans (\u201cfree\u201d health care, \u201cfree\u201d college, debt forgiveness, universal basic income\u2026) in return. Yes, this does almost guarantee yet another term in office\u2014job security for them! Most of these career politicians have never started a business, but they managed to grow wealthy on our dime while in office. I wonder how that happens. And the other party prefers to offer equal opportunities to everyone who wants to work hard in order to achieve their own\tversion of the American dream. I\u2019d rather keep more money in my pocket (via lower taxes) and decide for myself what I want to do with it. That is the essence of individualism in this country. But we are robbed of the opportunity when government thinks it knows better than the people what\u2019s best for us. Equal opportunity, not equal outcome. I\u2019ll take Trump and his tweets any day over any of the candidates in the opposing party, although I wish he\u2019d run them by me before posting. It\u2019s the only way his message can get out there, since journalism has lost its reason for being. You can\u2019t argue with the numbers\u2014the lowest unemployment rates for each of the minorities (indeed, among all Americans) ever! No contest! ",

My biggest question is whether Trump will be able to pull off a win in CA, NY, and IL, whether or not he\u2019ll get to 270. If Democrats really thought they could win in 2020, they would have had a better candidate then Biden. With Biden, it won\u2019t even be close. Historically, the incumbent president has not polled well in the summer. Most opinion polls these days are biased. What you need to look at is the real polls, the primaries. How did Trump do in NH vs Biden? How did Trump do in the other primaries to late? I don\u2019t recall a primary where Trump got less than 95%. Biden came in fifth in NH when polls showed he would place third. Biden was badly behind Saunders until the southern primaries. Trump, as I said, never got below 95% in the Republican primaries. If Biden had been leading in all the Democratic primaries, I would have more doubts about Trump winning, but Trump has been bringing out more voters to the polls than Clinton, Bush, or Obama in 96, 04, and 12 respectively. That is my reason for believing that Trump will easily win in 2020. ",

After Bernie Sanders halted his campaign, I told myself I would vote third party in November, based on principle and the fact that both political parties are corrupt. But one of my main issues that were important for me in 2020 was legalization of marijuana. I live in an illegal state and we didn\u2019t get enough signatures to have legalization be on the ballot, so it\u2019s a lost cause. Neither Trump nor Biden support legalization, but Biden supports decriminalization and to \u201cstudy it\u201d to make sure it isn\u2019t a \u201cgateway drug\u201d or something lol. That notion is laughable, but whatever, that\u2019s the typical conservative mentality/talking point from old Gen X\u2019ers / Baby Boomers like Mr. Joseph Biden. Anyways, I recently changed my mind and made the decision that I will vote Biden in Florida, a swing state, this November. First, I am optimistic that after a few months, Biden will be pressured by progressives and other groups to just fully legalize. Even if that doesn\u2019t happen, he will decriminalize federally.

And no, that Trump also is experiencing cognitive decay doesn't change the fact that this will hurt his chances significantly. But also it is clear to me that Trump is going to be able to run to Biden's left on criminal justice reform, TPP/NAFTA, and even social security, mostly by lying, but he can only lie because of some real truths about Biden's past on these issues, especially trade policy. Combine that with a very low turnout rate among young people as Biden was consistently the candidate that did worst in the primaries among that demographic, and it is is a perfect storm for a Democratic loss, maybe even worse than 2016. The only way I can see Biden winning is if there is a bad recession and he chose a really good vice-presidential pick. All little hope I have is that somehow Sanders does well this Tuesday and can turn things around in the next debate, win the nomination, and out-populist Trump. Otherwise, I think we are pretty screwed. Edit: As I wrote this answer we discovered that Biden is an \u201cO\u2019Biden Bama\u201d Democrat.  ",

Trump has consistently spread unscientific misinformation via the platforms he has to speak as president, has consistently lied about his actions, did not full-fill a lot of his promises especially around draining the swamp, bringing on more people with corporate and even criminal backgrounds then any past investigation and Trump has been genuinely dangerous to the civil rights protections all US citizens are entitled to via the equal protection clause and climate change. Biden has a horrible record for people who are liberals, and for the working class of America, especially the people that caused states to swing Trump last election, but he doesn\u2019t have a long record of actively endangering the lives of americans by spreading large-scale pseudoscience and Biden is at least better then Trump on civil rights protection for all US citizens and on climate change, even if he isn\u2019t that stellar on both of those subjects either. Another thing to considder is that Trump has been packing the supreme court with conservative justices, which is to be expected, but right now due to the atrocious actions of the republican party before Trump\u2019s presidency around Obama\u2019s Nominee, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s age: We are at a point that if Trump serves another term the supreme court will likely skew 6v3 conservative for decades. The supreme court is the protector of the constitutional rights of the people. It is dangerous for it to skew that heavily towards one side or the other politically as it makes judgements at large way more heavily dependant on ideological interference rather then the best protection of the constitutional rights of the people and the constitution in general possible.

With the Muller report out and possibly more coming later, creating a convincing narrative that Trump cooperated/colluded (whatever you want to call it) with the Russians and, while maybe not successful, did try to obstruct justice will help. Additionally, Trump has made some big promises such as repealing Obama Care, building a wall, and locking Hillary Clinton up; none of which he has successfully done (to date). It will be interesting what all new comes out between now and the next election (such as his tax returns). I think short of having his own scandal, if Biden focuses on all the ammo Trump seems to so readily provide he can defeat him. ",

This is everywhere, in key states in 2016, in Democrat-oriented states electing reactionary Republican governors, in all communities.

So far, Joe Biden does not seem to be that candidate who will be a candidate. He has not articulated on any issue of substance. He is a man without opinions and he is in danger to be a man without votes. As Harry Truman said in his 1948 upset campaign, when a Democrat runs as a Republican, the Republicans will win every time.

Unfortunately that means you need to determine what direction you believe the country, state, county, city, etc. needs to move in and which candidates are more likely to have policies that will be in that direction. So if you determine that Biden is best, vote for Biden, the same for Trump, or even the other smaller parties like Libertarian, Green Party, etc. ",

Biden can and does read. It has been widely reported by former members of his staffs that DJT will not read and may not be able to read at an adult level. Biden was accused of conniving with a foreign government to commit an illegal act, but no evidence has been produced to support the accusation. DJT was accused of extorting a foreign government to commit an illegal act. Overwhelming evidence supporting the accusation was presented during an impeachment trial, but all save one Republican in the US Senate chose to ignore it. Biden has never had a business or personal bankruptcy. DJT has had six. Biden has been criticized for excessive avuncular touching. DJT has been repeatedly accused of rape. Biden has never been sued for breach of contract. DJT has been sued, perhaps dozens of time, but he almost always reached \u201csettlements\u201d with those who sued him that included \u201cgag\u201d clauses that prevent anyone from talking about those matters. Biden is relatively smart. On almost every subject DJT is stupider than a bag of hammers. ",

Definitely, pulling a last minute switcheroo at the Democratic convention of the candidates would have thrown the Republicans off their game but, it\u2019s not clear Biden would have won anyway. If the Democrats really want to know why they lost the election they should just look in the mirror. Those Wikileaks emails reveal a party of corporate shills that collude with the press to make sure only the corporate approved politicians are put before the American electorate as candidates. This is precisely why Trump won. People who voted for Trump, voted against the establishment. I don\u2019t know why this is so hard for Democrats to understand. The Bush Republicans and the Clinton Democrats are exactly what people were voting against. I would have too if I wasn\u2019t so scared of Trump. The Democrats are finished now. They have completely lost the respect of the progressives who voted for Clinton only as a vote against the Trump monster. They won\u2019t do that again.

            "answer_text": "There are also major substantive caveats to Mr. Trump\u2019s fanfare. For all of the White House\u2019s talk of historic Middle East peace deals, Israel was not in an actual state of conflict with either the United Arab Emirates or Bahrain. The countries are merely consecrating a quiet alliance that had been developing for years, noted Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, who said that Mr. Trump was like \u201cthe rooster taking credit for the dawn.\u201d  Aaron David Miller, who worked on Middle East peace negotiating teams for several presidents, said the nominations paled in comparison with the accomplishments of past recipients: \u201cWhen you look at other Nobel Prize winners in the Middle East, what you see are mostly larger-than-life \u2014 even heroic \u2014 figures who expended huge amounts of political capital and took risks on enterprises that were truly challenging.\u201d He added, \u201cSadat and Rabin paid for their Nobels with their lives,\u201d referring to the slain leaders of Egypt and Israel, Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin. When Mr. Trump hosted the leaders of Serbia and Kosovo this month to sign an agreement to normalize economic relations, a first step toward potentially friendly coexistence, the president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, declared it \u201ca historic agreement\u201d at a celebratory news conference. Christopher Hill, a former career U.S. diplomat who played a central role in the American-brokered 1995 Dayton Accords, which brought peace to neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, derided the Trump administration\u2019s current efforts in the region as \u201cMcDiplomacy\u201d lacking \u201cthe serious work\u201d required to achieve lasting progress. The agreement also appears to have already run into trouble. It called for both Kosovo and Serbia to recognize Israel and open embassies in Jerusalem, with Israel returning the favor to Kosovo, which declared its independence from Serbia in 2008 and which Serbia does not recognize. But Israeli news reports say that Serbia is balking at Israeli recognition of Kosovo and will not open an embassy in Jerusalem after all if that happens. That threatens to unwind the entire agreement. The Balkans look easy by comparison to Afghanistan, where Mr. Trump is pursuing a comprehensive peace agreement to allow for a total withdrawal of American troops there. But as talks opened on Saturday, even optimists acknowledged that a durable peace remains a distant goal amid surging violence and countless political obstacles. And the announcement this week that the United States will pull nearly half its troops from Iraq, leaving 3,000 soldiers there, only reduces American forces in the country to about their level in 2015. 02 President Trump claims to have built new, secret nuclear weapon No result found, try new keyword!President Donald Trump is expanding his arsenal of spectacular, but hard to explain, claims about U.S. military might. 03 Sorry, Biden backers. President Donald Trump actually has more campaign cash now than 4 years ago President Trump's campaign ended July with $120 million, about three times more than the roughly $39 million it reported at this point in 2016. \"Trump and his allies will have as much money as they need,\" one pro-Biden operative acknowledged. The president also benefits from endless news coverage, punditry, and talk-show chattering about his latest press conferences, pontifications, and tweets. This doesn't cost Trump's campaign anything but helps get his message to voters. In addition to the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and several pro-Trump super PACs have planned heavy spending before Election Day. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Sorry, Biden backers. President Donald Trump is not running out of campaign cash. Trump's overall reelection effort remains flush with cash with 53 days until Election Day, particularly when compared with where it stood around this time four years ago. His coffers remain full despite notable speed bumps, including big-dollar donors disappearing, an internal audit into questionable spending, and Republican handwringing in a recent New York Times article and other publications over Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's recent financial surge. The Trump campaign ended July with more than $120 million, compared with about $99 million for Biden. For Trump, that's about three times more than the roughly $39 million his campaign reported at this point in 2016, an Insider review of Federal Election Commission records indicates. Similarly, the Republican National Committee ended July with about $110 million in reserve, compared with about $33 million for the Democratic National Committee. The RNC's stash is more than three times the $34.5 million it reported at the same point in August 2016. And while Biden's strong August fundraising has indeed diminished the Trump campaign's long-standing financial lead, neither campaign appears in jeopardy of running out of money, no matter how aggressive its 11th-hour spending gets, prominent Democrats and Republicans both acknowledged in interviews this week. Trump enters the BOK Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20. REUTERS/Leah Millis 'You can never have enough money' The Biden campaign and Democratic Party last week announced they together raised more than $360 million in August. The Trump campaign and Republican Party together said they raised about $210 million in August, significantly less than Biden but more than they ever had raised in a single month. Official figures for the full month of August, including cash-on-hand numbers going into September, are due to the FEC on September 20. \"We are confident that we will have the resources we need,\" Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens told Insider. \"It takes early investment and a lot of time to build a strong data operation and field program. The Democrats do not have either, and all the money in the world won't fix that.\" \"You can never have enough money, and you always want more,\" said Matt Gorman, a vice president at Targeted Victory, a digital-marketing firm that works with numerous Republican campaigns. \"But Trump, he doesn't need unlimited money to get in front of voters. The key is to spend it smart.\" Spending smart has been the clarion call of Trump's latest campaign manager, Bill Stepien, who usurped previous campaign manager Brad Parscale in July. Parscale is facing criticism \u2014 and even a federal complaint brought by the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center \u2014 for his management of the Trump campaign's money. Ed Rollins, the chairman of the pro-Trump Great America super PAC, accused Parscale of spending like a \"drunk sailor\" in a New York Times story this week. The article also cited Trump campaign staffers expressing concerns about a \"cash crunch\" in the final weeks before the election after burning through its money on expensive Super Bowl ads, fundraising fees, pricey consultants, and other seemingly frivolous expenses. Under Stepien, Trump's campaign scaled back advertising among other expenses in August, relying heavily on the norm shattering, infomerciallike Republican National Convention and surrounding hoopla to fill the void until Labor Day, when it planned to boost spending. Trump also benefits from endless \"earned media\" \u2014 news coverage, punditry, and cable talk show chattering about his latest press conferences, pontifications, and tweets. This doesn't cost Trump's campaign anything, and Trump enjoys a decisive earned media advantage over Biden, according to an August study by marketing firm What If Media Group. In the campaign's final weeks, expect the Trump campaign to double down on its early spending in battleground states, such as executing a robust get-out-the-vote effort, said Rory McShane, a Republican political consultant whose firm works with several dozen GOP political committees. \"They've prioritized field work, which is expensive. But Biden hasn't, and that's a Trump advantage,\" McShane said. Savings from COVID-19? But for the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump and Biden both would've been criss-crossing the country much more this year, likely staging an unending string of rallies and campaign events. Instead, both campaigns aren't spending as much money on some of the traditional trappings of a general election presidential campaign as they would in a United States free of an out-of-control deadly pandemic. Some areas of Trump campaign spending have even dropped from 2016 to 2020. For example, the campaign spent more than $666,000 on \"event staging\" in July 2016, while in July 2020, it spent about $230,000, according to FEC records. Even in the unlikely chance Trump's team blows through its reserves in a final scramble for four more years, it has a not-at-all secret weapon: Trump himself. During Election 2016, Trump fortified his campaign with more than $66 million of his own money. This time, Trump, who hasn't personally spent a dollar on his reelection bid, says he will if he must. It could come in the form of a loan or candidate contribution. But \"we don't have to,\" Trump said Tuesday. Trump, as he did in 2016, could also launch a gimmicky campaign donation incentive promotion, where he contributed a dollar of his own cash for every dollar other people gave, up to a certain cap. Additionally, there are several super PACs actively promoting Trump and bashing Biden, largely via television and digital advertisements. America First Action, the most prominent of these super PACs, entered August with more than $26 million cash on hand. Like its super PAC brethren, American First Action is animated by the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United v. FEC decision and empowered to legally raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. A wealthy Trump donor wishing to give it a seven- or even eight-figure contribution between now and the election is free to do so. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's fundraising diminished the Trump campaign's long-standing financial lead, but neither campaign appears at risk of running out of money. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo Biden confident \u2014 and cautious Biden, too, benefits from a constellation of super PACs that play by Citizens United's same rules, including Priorities USA Action, Unite the Country, Democracy PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, and the LCV Victory Fund. While taking joy in the president's campaign's financial foibles and believing Biden will win, some Biden advocates acknowledge that Trump isn't about to go broke. \"We've been outraising and outspending Trump's super PAC but our expectation is and always has been that Trump and his allies will have as much money as they need in this election,\" Priorities USA Action spokesperson Eliana Locke said. \"Joe Biden is going to win because he's the better candidate, not because he can now spend more money.\" Added American Bridge 21st Century spokesman Max Steele: \"As Democrats have made clear this entire cycle, no matter what the polls say or how much we raise, we will run like we're behind until every vote is counted.\" Biden campaign spokesperson Rosemary Boeglin said her team doesn't \"take a single penny for granted\" and will be \"spending smartly and strategically to bring new voters into the Biden coalition and energize our broad base of support.\" Biden himself texted supporters Thursday afternoon to warn of the president's financial strength. \"Trump is rapidly scaling up his campaign \u2014 raising tons of money and holding non-stop event,\" Biden wrote, before asking backers to \"rush $12 to the campaign to help share our message with voters\" during the next eight weeks.

If the economy recovers and COVID cases start to decline and stay declined into November it will make it maybe easier for Trump. The other one that could tip the balance is who Joe Biden\u2019s running mate is. If the running mate is someone who could balance the ticket well and lure in some of the Republicans who dislike Trump. If his running mate is the person who can lure in Republicans, then Trump is voted out this fall. If Biden picks a running mate that is too far left, Biden\u2019s chances are lower of winning. TL:DR. I would give him about a 70% chance of winning as July 1,2020. ",

It came from there due to their horrible sanitation conditions in market places. In fact all over the Pacific Rim they do the same idiotic things in market places. They are petrey dishes waiting to breed disease. DEAL WITH IT. ",

I don't exactly have Joe Bidens physical at hand so I can't say for sure but Donald Trump is a notorious liar so I could see him talking a lot of sh\u2014 before the fight even starts only to get K\"Oed in round two. This could go either way depending on how healthy Joe Biden is. I doubt Trump has much endurance so it would be possible for Biden to outlast him. I would have to say Biden would win in a test of endurance but if they really go at it trump could take it. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. Trump has an equal balance of strengths and weaknesses right now. His strength is the economy, and his policies in the eyes of many. His weakness is his personality: excessive and meanspirited tweets, narcissism, and hyperbole or outright lying. His dysfunctional management style is also suspect. As David Axelrod opined in a recent article letting Trump be Trump can be an effective path to his self-destruction. Biden can employ a rope-a-dope strategy, take the cautious highroad of being the adult in the room and see if the economy, international tensions or a myriad of unknown-unknowns come into play. He can also cleave together a strategy with the right VP selection that bonds blacks, suburban voters and the swing states into a winning coalition. I would say 2020 is a tossup. ",

Liars are apt to hire Liars to do their dirty work, like Trumps fixer Cohen.Cohen was reimbursed for the payments and had the checks to prove who paid him. Biden is in the process of opposing the extremely left wing ideas of the party and that will draw independents.Why would Trumps pollsters screw the survey ? s to infuriate him. The Dems will finally realise a more moderate candidate who draws moderate independents can beat Trump as Trump fears. Biden's old stance on bussing probably drew some Trump voters. As to opinions by AG Barr who Trump picked to protect him since the fired Sessions choose to obey his oath of office, I place little value. ",

He praises other authoritarian leaders because that\u2019s what he wants to be. Biden is a kind man with empathy and will do the right things for the people of this country.

I think no matter what the outcome is, the Democrats will not accept it. The president won the election last time and they would not stop going after him anyway. They impeached him with all that Russia nonsense and then there are tapes of these people admitting it was all lies we see years later. And then nobody apologizes or acknowledges anything and it just keeps going and going. And there is no end, it will never end with these people. Media and weirdos have painted this narrative like their side is bigger than it really is.

This morning, Biden gave a speech acknowledge the need to address equal rights for all citizens and urging protesters and police to avoid confrontations leading to violence, chastising those who commit unlawful and unhelpful acts of destruction and looting, and giving reasons why we should all come together as Americans to address the racial inequities that have plagued the country for two centuries. Trump is a corrupt wannabe dictator, first charged with racial discrimination crimes in 1973, who should be in prison. Biden is already a better president, and he\u2019s not even in office yet. ",

Donnie\u2019s first three years were a cake walk and pretty much anyone could have been in the Oval office and attained the same results in regard to the stock market and economy. Now that Donnie actually needs to be a leader, he is showing his weakness in performing that task. If the Corona virus outbreak gets worse and spreads to those states in the west and midwest, where he won the election, then it is very likely that Trump will be the first one term president since Bush 1.

It would be good to be able to believe what the President says. He has eight years experience as Vice-President and was Obama\u2019s best friend. Prior to that, he was in the senate for 36 years. Over the years we have seen his wife and baby daughter killing in an auto accident. He remarried later to a wonderful woman and they raised his children together. All the years he worked as a Senator and Vice-President, he always rode the same train to work and home. Sadly the year that Trump began campaigning and we thought Joe was going to run against him, his son Beau died of brain cancer. Once again he had to mourn the death of his son and wouldn\u2019t be able to concentrate on the Presidency. In comparing the two for President there is no comparison. Trump has been President for almost two years. He gave the rich a very large tax cut and ignored the middle class. He kidnapped the children of the families applying for visas and still has 500 locked up without their parents. He wants to cut social security and welfare to make up the money he gave to the rich. He uses the office to improve himself financially and wants white only refugees. He doesn\u2019t like black citizens, Muslims, and says they are from sh\u2014hole countries. He averages 30 lies a day and the news programs have to fact check everything he says. He has no government experience and seems to spend his whole day watching the news channels to see what they say about him. He has a base of voters that he can count on. They feel the same way he believes. So who would I Vote for? Joe Biden happily. ",

            "answer_text": "Who would win a fight between Donald Trump and Joe Biden? Like fisticuffs or cage fighting? Trump outweighs Biden by a good fifty pounds. Trump is three inches taller than Biden. Trump is 71. Biden is 75. Those would be Trump's only advantages. The Trump workouts of pounding Big Macs and swinging golf clubs would be of no help in a fight because they require almost no strength. Fighting requires much greater strength and enormous amounts of energy. Biden lifts weights and runs or rides a bike regularly. He has much more strength and stamina than Trump. I predict that Trump would start with a bit of adrenaline and manage a few clumsy haymakers that Biden would easily evade. After a minute, with all of his adrenaline used, Trump would be gassed and his guard would drop. Biden could step in safely and pepper Trump with jabs for quite some time. He would mix in some hooks and body blows just to keep Trump guessing. Someone would have to step in to stop the fight. Trump would proclaim victory. If you're talking about a battle of wits, Biden wins that too. Trump's strength is crude insults. He can beat anyone at that game. ",

This came off less offensively early in his presidency, but he has had a real opportunity to be a uniter in this country during this time and seems to be more interested in attacking and inflating his own ego. Biden is not a perfect candidate, but he does seem to show more empathy, whether it\u2019s genuine or not. ",

I think his best chance is if he and Sanders are a political ticket and they draw enough people (moderates) from the right. It's certainly a possibility. I think moderates might like Sanders but I'm simply being presumptive. Nothing is assured. If Trump can maintain a high approval rating he might win without much of a fight.

Like I wrote don\u2019t know if he can get out that Democrat liberal and progressive base to come out in droves. ",

He\u2019s also very old - he\u2019d be 77 years old when sworn into the Oval Office in January of 2021 and relying on Barack Obama\u2019s administration is a bad play because Obama\u2019s legacy has been rather turbulent since leaving the White House as members of the press have started to throw shade at him and some of his policies being so incomplete. Biden would struggle to stand up to Donald Trump. Personally speaking, I think most of the Dem candidates can\u2019t beat Trump, especially if Trump finds common ground with China, North Korea, and keeps a strong economy going into late 2020. He\u2019ll be virtually unbeatable despite his brash behavior. I think Andrew Yang could beat Trump simply because he\u2019d steal a lot of Trump voters and get a strong Democratic support because most Dems won\u2019t want to vote for Trump in 2020. ",

From what I\u2019ve seen of Joe Biden, the debates will turn many off when he is unable to string together a coherent plan for his presidency. Those turned off will either stay home, switch to Trump, or vote for Bernie Sanders as a write-in candidate. Any of the above will spell defeat for Biden. The debates will most likely end any thought of Joe Biden being elected President, because (again, whether you want to admit it or not) President Trump will be by far the smartest person on those stages, and Biden is not the quick thinker that the President is. If something dramatic happens between now and November, Biden has a shot. But much more likely is a Trump victory, and possibly a Trump landslide of Reagan-esque proportions. ",

Look at the blows life has thrown at him: his first wife and baby daughter killed, and his sons seriously injured, in a traffic accident during Christmas season, then his older son dying from cancer. He\u2019s still devoutly religious and has devoted his life to public service because he thought he could do some good there, even though he might have made more money in the private sector. He arrived in Congress intensely disliking Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC), although there was certainly plenty not to like about the old racist. Then, as he tells the story, Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield told him something he didn\u2019t know, which was that Helms and his wife had adopted a boy with cerebral palsy. It\u2019s very likely that the boy had been passed over for adoption before and was in the \u201chard to place\u201d category due to his handicap, but Helms opened his home and heart to him. You can dislike what the man does, Mansfield told him, but don\u2019t dislike the man himself. Now try (I can\u2019t) to imagine Trump taking to heart advice to like people even if he doesn\u2019t like what they do, and sacrificing a lucrative income to enter government service. Spare the comments about how he is sacrificing: he\u2019s making money hand over fist from the Trump Hotel in Washington.

Arizona is in play as is Ohio. Trump would have to be the lucky man in history to balance Corona, bad economy, high unemployment, his attempt to eliminate healthcare, Russian issues especially with the bounties on US soldiers, and his racist image to pull off a win.

First, yes, Biden is generally leading Trump in head-to-head polls, but by considerably less of a margin than Clinton was at this point in 2016. Second, voter enthusiasm for Biden is considerably lower than it was for Clinton in 2016 and less than half of Trump\u2019s number, the lowest ever recorded for a Democratic nominee. Nobody with that little voter enthusiasm has ever been elected as President. Third, this is all even before people find out that there is now a credible allegation of rape against Biden. ",

One thing Biden has (which Donald J. Trump will never have) is the ability to change the way he expresses himself, depending on who he is talking with. Donald J. Trump is very good at rallying his base and making them think he is behind him. But he would be very poor anywhere else. Try to imagine how he would be received at Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA campus.

Trump has viewed the presidency as his personal fiefdom for the last three years. Donald Trump\u2019s policy has seen to be just rolling back anything that President Obama did, because he hates Obama for some reason. Maybe because the American people actually liked Obama, unlike him. When it comes to environmental regulations and protecting public health, keeping the secular government that our Founding Fathers gave us, Joe Biden is superior. We will have a president who doesn\u2019t lash out and call the media traitors for asking him tough questions. We will have a president who doesn\u2019t praise dictators. We will have a president that we can finally once again, have some pride in. ",

First, Biden is pretty honest so the citizens will not have to constantly fact check and worry about not knowing what's going on. Biden is also both empathetic and kind. He, unlike Trump, is capable of deeply loving this nation and its' people. This does not make him weak. It makes him a leader. Secondly, Biden can behave on the world stage without making our allies either detest or distrust us. Biden can also speak on an adult level (gaffes and all) and he is highly educated in law and governance. Just to have these few things back would be enormously reassuring to us\u2026 and would dramatically reduce our collective exhaustion. Just so you know, Biden would not be my first pick, but I do respect and trust him. In fact, I have trusted, respected, and admired many president's of both parties over my lifetime \u2014up until now. ",

When unemployment is low and wages are up and consumer confidence is up, most moderate voters are going to stick with what works and not go for a radical progressive/socialist candidate. If we had a recession or a war or something, people might be looking for a shakeup, but currently, there\u2019s too much risk in voting for the Democrat. ",

Plus, Trump appears to be letting the pressure get to him. He sent out almost 200 tweets in one day recently. Working? Not much. Obsessing over impeachment? More like it. He is hard-pressed for accomplishments. It looks as though McConnell won\u2019t bring the new trade agreement to replace NAFTA to a vote (and Mexico is objecting to some key provisions involving labor rules). A judge has blocked his major funding for the famous Wall, which he was going to take from military allocations. He seems to have worked something out with China, but it\u2019s said to be pretty minimal. He doesn\u2019t have clue what to do about Afghanistan (although to be fair, nobody does). He has a strong fan base, but there are millions who really, really hate his guts, and I mean hate. They see him as a big, braggadocious sleazeball without a conscience. And, icing on the cake, he is letting it be known that he doesn\u2019t want to do any debates. So\u2014chances of winning? Not looking good. But the election is still almost eleven months away. So don\u2019t despair, Trumpers. Maybe your boy will find some new source of foreign interference to pull out a win. ",

By that time, things were underway, and although he would\u2019ve posed a real challenge to Clinton and Sanders (unlike, say, Jim Gilmore), the head start the other Democratic candidates had on him might have doomed him in the primaries. Or he could\u2019ve split the vote among mainstream Democrats and made things more difficult for himself and Clinton, who is less charismatic but probably closer to his politics than Sanders is. Had he made it to the nomination, about which there is nothing certain, he might have helped the Democrats get a higher turnout than they did (which may very well have been what provoked the loss), or not. In the end, we\u2019ll never know for sure. ",

It's all going to be about leadership. Trump can continue to pump manipulating material about Biden but he will not be able to explain AWAY HIS LACK OF LEADERSHIP IN A TIME OF CRISIS. He can not ATTACK the coronavirus. He can not belittle the victims of pandemics, natural disturbances. His number 1 job is to keep America safe. He has failed miserably. ",

He is reluctant to listen to anyone, especially if they disagree with him, and he undermines his own people if they say something that he either doesn\u2019t agree with or if they say something he agrees with and he later changes his mind on a subject. Many people say one or the other has dementia. If so, trump is the mean one, Biden one of the happy ones. Of the two, I look forward to voting for Joe Biden this fall. Another 4 years of trumps dishonesty, self serving, mismanagement of this country will be disastrous. ",

People are getting sick, some will be hospitalized, and a few will die\u2026maybe more than a few. People will realize this notion of COVID being no big deal from Trump is a bunch a BS. In addition, any economic rebound will crash and burn with the rebound of COVID. This will hurt Trump in these states, by probably 3\u20134 points. That makes FL, AZ, GA, NC light blue. TX is is a coin flip. Upper midwest will go to Biden: The black vote in MI, WI and PA will not stay home in 2020. So here is my map: 2020 Presidential Election Interactive Map I maybe too bullish on Ohio\u2026but that will not matter. Unless something changes, I think Biden will pick up 350\u2013406 electoral votes. If my theory of COVID is wrong, I think Biden will win, but it will be closer, with somewhere between 293 and 330 electoral votes. 2020 Presidential Election Interactive Map ",

One worry is Biden\u2019s mental health, there are claims that he declines. Some of his gaffes are easily explained by his stutter, others not so much.

This may lead to a lower turnout with potentially more supporters showing out for the one who lagged in the polls.

If Trump is re-elected, it will almost certain be at a smaller margin than what he won by in 2016. The two closest states Hillary won were New Hampshire and Minnesota, meanwhile. In both of these states, Trump suffers from double digit disapproval, as well as in Iowa, a state which broke heavily for him in 2016. In Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, the three states that put him over, he has consistently had 5\u201310 point disapproval ratings. The state he\u2019s most likely to lose of the three is Michigan, which delivered three new Democrats to the House, re-elected their Democratic Senator by an extremely comfortably margin, and installed a Democratic Governor. Pennsylvania is also a lean to the Democrats, and Wisconsin is a bare tilt. He\u2019s also suffered from low approvals in Ohio, Arizona, and North Carolina, with break even numbers in Florida, Texas, and Georgia. Here are four potential outcomes for the 2020 election, based on Trump\u2019s hypothetical handling of the current pandemic and recession, as well as his past approvals and the 2018 midterms.

It currently seems highly unlikely that Biden could turn himself into a credible candidate in time to win the democratic nomination. Apart from his many flaws as a candidate, he is simply too old. So Trump\u2019s ability to defeat Biden (if he does have that ability) will have nothing to do with who is elected president in 2020. ",

If a candidate is doing so well in one state the RNC will decide not to spend any more money there because it would be unnecessary. On the other hand, if a candidate is doing badly in one state it will pull its remaining money out because it would be a waste of its money and instead put that money in states where the chances of winning are better.

President Trump is systematically purging the United States government of career civil servants whose loyalty is to the Constitution, science, and the rule of law, and replacing them with lackeys who are personally loyal to him. One of many examples is Trump's firing of Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community's inspector general, who forwarded the whistle blower's complaint to Congress regarding Trump's effort to extort a political favor from an ally by threatening to withhold vital military aid. Mr. Atkinson was required by law to disclose this information to Congress. Trump has demonstrated repeatedly that he has little regard for safeguards created by Congress after Watergate to increase government accountability, and expects executive branch officials to serve his personal interests. This is a dangerous time for American democracy. Trump's goal seems to be to replace constitutional democracy with an authoritarian system similar to what they now have in Russia, Hungary, and India. The really scary thing is that many Republicans seem to be ok with that. ",

Trump hasn\u2019t offered any plan. Biden would help develop a more rational foreign policy. He would regain the trust of our traditional allies and stand up to our enemies. Biden would trust Science. He would rejoin the Paris Accords. The problem of climate change cannot be solved without world wide cooperation. Biden would also be better prepared for future crises like the current pandemic. Biden has said he will be open to working with Republicans. This is our only hope, since we are so divided now. Biden would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented workers, avoiding having families be separated and he would still insure that we have secure borders. Yes, we can do both. Finally, a Biden cabinet would look like America. He would include highly qualified women, persons of color and gay persons. Trump\u2019s cabinet and advisors are mostly white men. I have nothing against white men, I am one, but we are losing out on so much talent by being restrictive. ",

I would say that perhaps Charles Manson would lose on the better person front to Donald, but he just died, so there is Donald soaking in the bottom of the barrel again. Okay, I am being sarcastic. I hear that Donald is somewhat likeable and actually does have a heart, but he is easily influenced, and thus a puppet for right-wing politicians pushing their agenda. On the other hand, Joe came up from a more normal home, in a blue collar neighborhood. He performed his job as vice president well, and was a great side-kick to President Obama. At the end of his presidency, President Obama had a really great respect for each other, you can tell in several of the pictures representing them. However, in 2015 when Joe was asked to run for president, his beloved son Beau died, and being a family man, Joe did not have the heart to run. I honestly believe that Joe Biden would make a great president. He has been through a lot, and always picked himself up even when he went down hard. He was a lawyer, senator, understands foreign policy, and was able to get Mitch McConnell to agree to pass a tax bill that satisfied both parties - a feat that Donald has yet to accomplish.  ",

Although, the economy has taken a dreadful nosedive due to the pandemic, I believe he is the best choice to bring it back to prosperity, as before the pandemic, the economy was soaring. As for Biden, and other Democrats, it is the same old story. The Democrats are always wanting to grow the government and to have as many people as possible to be dependent upon the government, and in my view, this is a recipe for disaster. I also believe Trump is much better prepared to handle foreign affairs. For example, he has been talking about the dangers of being too dependent on China for medicine and other products, long before he ran for office. Additionally, Biden was part of the dreadful Obama administration. On a personal level, it seems clear that Biden is not even close to being competent, and I\u2019m not trying to be insulting, but he is, seemingly , befuddled. ",

Trump would demand impossible conditions then say Biden was afraid to fight him. If Trump did get in a fight and got the tar beat out of him he would claim he pitted Biden too much to hit him then launch teams of lawyers to keep any journalists from reporting on the fight. ",

Neither convention was exceptional and just the usual the other guys bad , we are good and only our party can save the United States. Factors in play here are continued rioting and burning of cities and Biden dropping out of the debates. In politics it\u2019s important to remember that in the final analysis , Nov. 3rd is winner and loser time. With the exception of a few times in history, races get tighter and I assume this will get tighter also.",

From what we can discern, he's hoping his allies will do most of the stumping and talking on his behalf. This is a new and tricky method of campaigning. The apparent strategy, is to allow the Democratic issues and talking (bullet) points, .. to Carry the day. That is, evade making the person, the Crux, of who the voters are supporting. Rather, tease the voters to vote on the talking points instead. Whether this tactic will work or not, is hard to figure. I've been voting in most elections for nearly twenty five years now. I've never seen such a low profile method employed by a candidate, running for the White House. My suspicion is that, while the strategy is new\u2026 It just might work \ud83e\udd14 ",

Biden also has a good shot of appealing to the Obama voters who voted for Trump in 2016. Trump clearly seems to fear Biden the most, and Trump supporters are over-confident that Trump will be easily re-elected. The big challenge for Biden will appealing to Bernie supporters to show up and vote. But they are not very reliable voters anyway (the younger folks have much lower rates of voting than older). ",

Or try to imitate the esteemed leaders of Russia and North Korea. Or appoint people to run the very agencies they\u2019ve publicly stated they would like to destroy. Or any number of other truly awful things Trump has done. It would just\u2026 lie there. Joe Biden would be miles better than the rock. ",

Particularly, Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic has been far from satisfactory. Biden has the support of Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and others, in fact it is believed even moderate Republicans back Biden\u2019s bid for the White House. Trump\u2019s popularity rating has dipped considerably, especially after Covid-19, and is lesser than Biden\u2019s. It is obvious Americans want a change.. In Biden, we are seeing the prospective 46th President of the United States. That is what I reckon. ",

Whether or not it's a coordinated campaign, the mainstream media is clearly no fan of Trump. In the end, the comparison of the candidates come down to Trump and not-Trump.

I have a lot of problem with how Trump has governed but I also approve of many of the things he's done. I don't feel any attraction to Biden as a candidate.

Between the press, the shameless behavior of US Senators and the phony collusion narrative, that is a lot to deal with. I have always liked Joe Biden personally and Gillibrand seems to be someone that I could agree with on many policies, I could be wrong but she seems to be the most centrist, in fact the only real centrist Democrat at this time. My major issue with them at this point is not themselves personally, it is the absolute degradation of their party ever since 2008. The Democrats were the party of my father and grandfather, I am pretty sure they would be shocked and disgusted by the present state of This organization which once legitimately represented the views and aspirations of working class and middle-class Americans ",

It opens more cans of worms than it closes. Please regard the following as my attempt at a partial answer. A complete answer is one that may require years of analysis; psycho and otherwise. None of us has either the time or energy to undergo that. I want to say that I am not a single issue voter. JRB\u2019s voting record is available to anyone that asks. DJT\u2019s positions on various issues before his nomination was unknown. Not the least reason because he had never run for political office before. Second, this answer is based on a single issue and is a superficial one at that. It is based on about six minutes of internet research so take it as you will. Third, DJT has already accused Google of being biased against him. Apparently a lot of people also think that the world is against them. I happen to think that Google\u2019s search algorithms are pretty good. The overall point is that I don\u2019t expect that this will change anybody\u2019s mind one way or the other. It certainly wouldn\u2019t change mine. I asked Google a pair of questions and I got the following results: Has Donald J. Trump been shown to be a liar?About 46,300,000 results (0.46 seconds) Has Joseph R. Biden been shown to be a liar?About 7,230,000 results (0.46 seconds) That\u2019s it. It may also be useful to compare what is seen on the first page of both google queries. I suggest that you try it for yourself and let us know what the results are.

Biden has already released several years of tax returns and has already been vetted for previous positions. He has seen the job from the #2 spot and has ideas as to how to avoid some of the problems others have caused or encountered.He also understands compromise, unity, and diplomacy and is not known for position flipping or outrageous lying. He has appeal for the working class as well as the wealthy and understands the country\u2019s place on the world stage. These factors alone make him a better bet. Then, in my opinion, anyone would be a better president than Trump. I\u2019ve not seen samples of Mr. Biden\u2019s writing either, but hopefully he paid attention in elementary school and remembers the rules for capitalization and spelling. My final hope is that he has thoughts and aspirations that exceed the character limit of Twitter. ",

To get a chance at the presidency requires a lot of single minded focus and impression management.

I\u2019m not sure what kind of person Donald Trump would have been had he been more challenged and been something other than the son of a wildly successful entrepreneur. I think in general, most people are on auto pilot. Few really go beyond that. I\u2019m not ready to say that is true of either JB or DJT. Superficially, JB does a better job appealing to my personal values. I can relate to someone that has dealt with some really difficult life experiences. Tragedy haunts Joe Biden once again - CNNPolitics What I wish: We had the requirement that political leaders spend some face to face time with panels of citizen chosen by lottery from voters.

I only have to look at the economy to strengthen my reason. There are many more reasons, and I take it for granted and by observation that we are 100% better off today, job wise and economy wise than the previous four presidents. And I take immense dislike and disgusted with the former administration for creating the chaos in the other party and creating the party of protest, demonstration, destruction of property, filth (defecating/urinating in the streets) and amount of trash left after their efforts, obstruction of any thing proposed by opposing people even when severely needed, the public and media vulgar language that permeates our very soul, and the documented crimes against them and no action taken. Worst of all the wanton idiocy of importing so many Islamic people to this country that have vowed to kill us all and that hate us, and now we have four of them in congress. Lastly, the fact that Obama said that we are no longer a Christian nation! ",

Fortunately I live in a state that\u2019s blue enough that if it did come down to Biden or Trump, I can vote 3rd party without worrying about Biden losing the state. But I really hope the Democrats aren\u2019t dumb enough to run another establishment Dem again. Sanders would have slaughtered Trump, but sadly the Democrats played games with the primaries to get their darling in. But people are sick of the status quo. People are sick of a party that ignores the needs of the people. That\u2019s why Trump won - he was able to talk to the needs of the people (even if he was a lying sack of shit, and even if the people who voted for him because of that were fools for thinking that someone with a gold toilet would ever care about them). At this point, we need new blood. My ideal would be Tulsi Gabbard. She supports many of the policies that Sanders does, even resigning her position in the DNC to support him. She also served in the military, leaving office to do so. If it comes down to Trump or another establishment Dem, then the smartest thing would be for someone like Sanders or Gabbard to break off and run 3rd party. Yes it would split the Dem vote, but it would also split the Trump vote, giving people who actually did vote for Trump in the hopes that he would support them a candidate who actually will support them. Anyone left who would vote for Trump wouldn\u2019t have voted Biden anyway. ",

As for your question it seems that there is a lot of enthusiasm for getting Trump out of office, fewer who really like him although they seem devoted and it seems anyone from Biden to Sanders could win this election. Many folks have pledged to support anyone other than Trump. ",

The fix is in for Harris, the dream ticket includes Booker, fortunately, they will lose to Trump, which is just as well, as neither are honest and both would do anything to be in power.

Because of this, I am very circumspect where polling data is concerned. One thing that cannot be obscured by polls and clever ads is Biden\u2019s cognitive decline. Increasingly, conjecture over his potential dementia has morphed into a conclusion. Regardless of party or ideology, most Americans will not accept having a demented man as our Commander-in-Chief. ",

The reason for that is of course that Republicans currently control all 3 branches of government. I\u2019m hoping that changes in another 2 weeks. And then officially in January. ",

Is he a crypto-fascist (or an increasingly overt fascist, like Trump)? No. But I would argue that neoliberalism , with its capitalism fetish, is a political philosophy that has enabled America\u2019s generations-old tendency toward fascism to grow, even flourish. America needs a clean break from BOTH parties. I will vote for whichever candidate of ANY party affiliation who supports the policies and vision of the future I support, period. ",

If you are really going to vote for Biden for president, you are  voting for this VP choice....and Stacie Abrams? Really? Do you hate Trump THAT much? If you are a serious democrat you should be doing all you can to convince Michelle Obama to accept the nomination...the only real hope you have of winning this year. ",
