            "answer_text": "Web-Development is an art. To make a nice website there are various languages to follow. It depends in term of security and reliability. All the Websites are consist of three different layers : Front-End : The design of the website which is usually made by common language which is compulsory to learn to all the web-developers.HTML - Hyper-text Markup Language.CSS - Cascade Style SheetJavaScript (basic) and JQuery framework(optional for beginners).Back-End : This part is tricky because a new developer has to figure out between different languages available. I am going to provide you simple list according to their easy learning and security.Java (and other JVM languages like Scala, Groovy, Clojure)PHP..NET (C#, VB)Ruby.Python.Perl.Database : After you done with front-end design and back-end working of the page. Database comes to role for saving the user data and fetching them when the time is right.MySQL (best)Microsoft Access.Microsoft SQL Server Express.Oracle Express Edition.DB2 Express-C.which one is best? When i started learning website development i went with HTML + CSS > JavaScript > PHP > JQuery(framework) > MySQL(basics). None of the language is best until you master it. You, developers are the people who makes any language best by providing their ideas, implement them and making the language more secure by good algorithm. For more suggestions, contact me. ",

            "answer_text": "In static or very simple websites you can just use HTML, CSS and JS, as the another answer to this question have said. But, if you\u2019re going to do something complex, then you should learn something better. I don\u2019t recommend start learning PHP now, since most companies just hire PHP programmers to maintain their existing code. I have no idea why would someone use Python in a website, it\u2019s just a terrible idea (it\u2019s super slow). Now we have basically two options (the most widely used): C# and Java. I would choose Java (for obvious reasons), but for someone who don\u2019t care, here is a tip: .NET (what you will need to build the website with C#) is pretty slow, completely dependent on Microsoft (the core is open-source, but everything else is not) and Visual Studio is very expensive. Basically Java with JSF for \u201cthe basics\u201d, and if you need to store things in a database (almost the reason why websites exist) JPA. ",
