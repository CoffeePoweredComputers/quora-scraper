            "answer_text": "I put together a pretty comprehensive rundown of stores like Urban Outfitters that\u2019s probably too long to post in full here, but here are some of the cheaper ones on the list: H&M - Probably your best bet for clothes that are similar in style to Urban Outfitters, but much cheaper. (Unfortunately, the quality of the pieces often reflects this.) Amazon - Their Goodthreads and Amazons Essentials brands are both great, more affordable alternatives to Urban Outfitter\u2019s clothes. Zara - More fashion-forward than Urban Outfitters, but dirt cheap. Madewell - Owned by J.Crew, it\u2019s their cheaper alternative for staples like jeans, tees and sweaters. Topman \u2013 Great place for affordable slim-fitting pieces. Asos \u2013 Similar to Topman in style, quality and price. Hope this helps! As I say, there were a lot of other options in my full list, but not all are cheaper. Many are comparable in price, and a few are more expensive because they\u2019re better quality, higher end brands, or both. ",
