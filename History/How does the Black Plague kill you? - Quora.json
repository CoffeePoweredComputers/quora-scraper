            "answer_text": "Unpleasantly. The Black Death was an epidemic of Yersinia pestis bacteria which originated in China in the 1330s and moved Westwards through Constantinople and eventually throughout the whole of Europe. It was primarily carried by the fleas found on black rats (Rattus rattus) although it could remain dormant in bales of wool and fabric being moved around the continent for trade. Arriving in a city, it would infect the rat population first and by the time the first humans were affected, it was weeks later and too late. Initial infection was usually through a flea bite, introducing the Y. pestis into the lymphatic system. If it remained just in the lymphatic, it manifested as BUBONIC plague. 1 to 7 days after exposure, the lymph nodes in the armpits, groin and neck would become hard and feel hot and painful. These are known as buboes. The victim would run a very high fever with chills, have seizures, pain in the limbs and gangrene in the extremity. In the Middle Ages, without antibiotics, 40\u201360% of victims died. Sometimes the Y. pestis spilled out of the lymphatic system and entered the lungs or the blood stream. If it entered the lungs, it was known as secondary PNEUMONIC plague. Within 2 days, sometimes less, the victim would run a very high fever, have coughing fits - including coughing up blood - have chills, extreme weakness, terrible headaches and chest pain. Without antibiotics, almost 100% died within days from Shock and respiratory failure. Moreover, the infected were extremely *infectious*. Y. pestis was spread in droplets in the cough, spreading new cases of pneumonic plague, which bypassed the lymphatic system (Primary Pneumonic) and progressed quickly. In the bloodsystem, it was known as secondary SEPTICAEMIC plague and was almost 100% fatal. The victim would get the usual high fever, weakness and chills, which would be accompanied by vomiting blood, bleeding from the eyes, nose and rectum, bleeding beneath the skin. Within a few days, the victim\u2019s organs began to fail and shock set in, usually proving fatal. ",
