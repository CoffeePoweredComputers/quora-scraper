If you decide to stay on campus on Diwali, you'll get to eat a special Gala dinner, enjoy DJ Night, burn crackers and enjoy the seasonal lights that are put on hostels and acad block. For durga puja we don't get a holiday but generally we get pandals and a celebratory mini fair sort of which has street food vendors and some games, all organized by the Bengali Regional Association (at least that's what happened last year) I hope this answers your query.
