            "answer_text": "I saw Queen with Freddie in 1979, 1982 and 1984. I have very fond memories of the \u201979 gig as it was only the second proper gig I\u2019d been to. It was in December and Crazy Little Thing was recently out and the band did a crazy Little Tour of London. I saw them at the Alexandra Palace gig. I\u2019d just turned 15. The gig was great, but loud. The pace was fast and the atmosphere fantastic. I managed to get myself on wedged on a pillar so I could see. It was essentially the set from Live Killers, although they opened with Jail House Rock, and played Somebody to Love, Crazy Little Thing and Save Me. The highlights were the solo parts, the May solo, the drum solo, and the double delayed Freddie vocal (largely from Prophet Song), plus the very strange part of Get Down, Make Love. Brian played Silent Night on acoustic and we all sang along. At the end Freddie came on to We Will Rock You on the shoulders of Superman with a bunch of bananas on his head, which he licked, peeled and threw to the audience. Apparently no one knew he was gay then. Really?! The \u201982 gig was the Milton Keynes one which is available on DVD. You can see my 17 year old self briefly at the front. It was a full day with support from Joan Jett and The Teardrop Explodes (who I liked but the audience generally hated). Queen came on as the sun set behind them over the ouches of the gig. By now the May solo remained, marred slightly by Brian pulling his guitar lead out accidentally, and the Freddie part was a crowd singalong. By now they had added Spike Edney to the live band on keys. As always the part of Bohemian Rhapsody where the band come back on stage after playing the record for the operatic section was great, and is still the same today with Adam. The Works tour was less exciting for me. Wembley arena is seated and so we were sat upstairs out of the way. The set was clever, using the imagery from the album, and Spike\u2019s keys were more prominent. I was going to go to the Kind of Magic gig at Wembley stadium, but decided against it, thinking I\u2019d go on the next tour\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "I saw Queen with Freddie 3 times. Once in 1980, at The NEC in Birmingham, UK. The second time was at The Milton Keynes Bowl in 1982. This was filmed for a TV special and later released as the Queen On Fire long form video/DVD. The last time was at Knebworth in 1986. This turned out to be Freddie\u2019s last ever gig. Obviously, we didn\u2019t know this at the time. All 3 times, he was the consummate showman who had a supreme vocal ability. At Knebworth, the official attendance was 120,000, but it\u2019s estimated that there was closer to 200,000 there that day. From the moment they band walked on stage, Freddie had the entire crowd in the palm of his hand. With just a wave of his hand, he got everybody singing along. My biggest memory of that day is during Radio Gaga. The crowd were doing the \u2018clap and reach\u2019 during the chorus, from the video and I looked around and saw the whole crowd doing it. I remember saying to my mate \u201cpoliticians would kill to have this sort of power over a crowd of this size\u201d. ",
