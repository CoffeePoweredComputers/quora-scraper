            "answer_text": "Considering that the Carrington event happened less than 200 years ago, and we know that coronal mass ejections are relatively frequent \u2014 although one would have to be pointed with some accuracy and maintain a certain duration and intensity in order to wreak maximum chaos \u2014 it\u2019s reasonable to speculate that there\u2019s a fair probability that it could occur within the same time frame of, say, an earthquake along the San Andreas fault, which is to say, around 150 years. Whether it could end civilization is a pretty big stretch, although it has been speculated that a major strike on North America could result in the obliteration of the power grid for up to a year and the deaths of up to one-third of the population. The most troubling aspect of this geomagnetic storm scenario is that, at present, there is no coordinated effort to harden the U.S. / Canadian infrastructure against such an event, nor any government or industry agency tasked with even the study of such an effort. As long as we have numerous huge electrical transformers on the grid for which we have no inventory of replacements, and with the manufacturing time for those replacements running to the better part of a year, I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty vulnerable. Forget aliens. Forget the asteroid. Fear the sun. ",

            "answer_text": "The question, as currently presented is: \u201cIs there a possibility that another geomagnetic storm like the Carrington event will happen in modern times? If so, would civilization as we know it end?\u201d The current coronavirus pandemic, together with catastrophic natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes and asteroids, will first attempt to awaken humankind to the need for providing the basics for human survival to all humans (see the tenets of the Humanity Party\u00ae). If these events do not catch our full attention, as to the purposes for which they will be allowed, then the disruption of the world\u2019s infrastructure, similar to the Carrington event, will be allowed. This will deal a devastating blow to the world\u2019s economy; but civilization will not end. Instead, domestic and foreign terrorists will be allowed to use nuclear weapons that will destroy human society. SOURCE:  ",
