            "answer_text": "So, The current scene in whole country is lockdown, people can't go outside for no reason and you should also stay at your home But as per your question i have some ideas that will help you to find your girlfriend. The only people who are outside are doctors and police men and women so you can go to appreciate them and bring some chocolates and flowers to female doctors or police women so that they would be Impress to you or you can do it with male doctors or police men so they can take your chocolates and flowers to home and give her daughters and tell them about you because i think this is the only way you can apply for a girlfriend in this pandemic. Everything written above was answer of your funny question but i think you should remember that this isn't a girlfriend or sex that makes your life beautiful and bring happiness to you so don't try to see your happiness in someone's or don't try to fit in story or don't try to fit someone in your life/story. just be real and loyal and see how good things happens in your life.
