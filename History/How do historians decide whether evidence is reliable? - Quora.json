            "answer_text": "Corroboration is the central pillar, though there are other measures. If a text is discovered that seems to indicated something, say, that the Romans built flying machines, the first thing to do is comb the records we already have and see if there is anything that supports that claim. Are there any references to these flying machines anywhere else? Remember that it is not just does it mention them directly, but it is often necessary to look for contextual evidence. One might look at economic documents to see if there is anything that might indicate the production of such machines, or through military records to see if anyone has ever been called 'aviator' or similar. The more of that kind of supporting evidence that can be found, the more reliable the original assertion seems. Naturally each of these pieces of evidence need also to be thought reliable, either though virtue of already being in the corpus of accepted knowledge, or though corroboration with other texts; as well as the stuff on flying machines, the supporting text might contain references to Suetonius or the campaigns of Ceasar, which can then be checked. Similarly historians work very closely with archaeologists, and both are called on to corroborate the other's findings. Evidence of flying machines amongst Roman ruins, or allusions to them in Roman carvings would be strong supporting evidence. Obviously this system does not create certainty, but it is not supposed to. A founding principle of Historical Study, indeed of all academic disciplines is a recognition that one can be mistaken and thus will need to alter ones views accordingly. There is, or ought not to be a point at which any given interpretation of history should have a line drawn under it and declared complete. Because we cannot, so far as we know, actually experience those historical events, and their effects, good historians always accept that even the best work is interpretation, albeit a very well informed one. Aside from corroborating the evidence, other ways of determining its reliability include: Checking for biases in the Author.Did the writer have a vested interest in portraying events in a certain way? Is the subject especially controversial? Could the author, or their audience be prejudiced in some way about this issue?Checking the dates.The closer to the actual events the writer is the more reliable their evidence tends to be. This applies to location as well.Internal consistency.While texts can have historical value even if they are not consistent, for them to be viewed as an accurate retelling of events, and not as a cultural or social record, requires consistency. Are events told of in a clear way, without exaggeration, that creates a single non-contradictory narrative?",

            "answer_text": "It depends entirely on the evidence that a historian has. It also depends on the quantity of information at hand.  If you had a single historical document on a subject then you would have no way to compare it to other historical documents about the same topic. That doesn't mean that you can't work out whether it is reliable or not though. The main things you need to look at are the bias of the writer, the purpose of the piece and also if there is any other evidence that could prove or disprove part or all of what is written.  The first example would be an obituary or even an epitaph. It is unlikely that someone would write anything derogatory in such a piece. The piece is likely to be a celebration of achievements. Therefore the document would be biased in favour of the person it is written about. When you have such information you need to compare anything they have done to what we already know or is written elsewhere. Do the persons life events make sense. For example someone could write and obituary for me or someone I know well that stated they founded google. That is a verifiable fact and therefore it could be disproved by looking up the actual founders. When you get further back in time you have less evidence for this but you can cross reference some things. take military history. Someone my say that such and such a general commanded troops winning a battle. There are going to be documents for deployment in a lot of time periods which allow us to find out if they were actually there and what exactly they were in command of. In that way you can work out which of the statements are correct. There are likely to be some that can't be corroborated but if everything else checks out then those other statements are likely to be factual as well. Of course if they are completely made up then all other statements would likely be untrue.  Bias like this can be seen in nearly all sources. When we have documents describing a particular people across a border, such as the Picts and their description by the Romans, then we are looking at a document that may be written with the best intentions but factually incorrect. Something else to be considered is the world view of the author. As in the above example a Roman scholar would likely see the idea of a Roman empire and structured towns etc. as the pinnacle of humanity. Anything different would be considered less advanced and not merely different. Even the term Barbarian, which is often used in these types of sources, came from a Greek racial superiority standpoint in the city states. This is not as much of an issue if you can work out what bias the author of the piece has. Once a bias can be seen then you can discount exaggerations to a certain extent, you can also tease out factual knowledge as often stereotypes come from somewhere. Time is another big factor. Many of the sources we have about the Dark ages and indeed from many periods were written a lot later than the events they tell us about. This knowledge often comes through an oral tradition and not through scholarly unbiased (if there is such a thing) works. The stories then turn into legends. A classic example is the tale of Hengist and Horsa. This initial tale fell in line with what historians wanted to think for a long time. While seen as myth by many the basic concept of an Anglo-Saxon invasion was hard to shift. In the last few decades more work has been brought together to confirm or deny the hypothesis and historians tend to lean the opposite direction suggesting a migration and not an invasion. See here for my take on it: Did the Anglo-Saxons invade Britain or was it a more peaceful take over?. When we have sources written later then we need to consider what was prevalent at the time of writing. With the above example the story of invasion was supported by both the Britons and the Anglo-Saxons for different reasons. Ie. 'they invaded our land we need to get rid of them', and, 'The Britons weren't able to fight off our glorious warriors look how good we are'. To verify whether these stories are indeed correct you need to find physical evidence. So if you have a consistent narrative that has some verifiable 'facts' from other documents how do you make sure that it truly is reliable apart from looking at the bias of the author?  Well the archaeological maxim 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence' comes into play here. Due to the nature of archaeology there may be things that are completely lost to us and others that we just haven't found evidence for yet. Archaeology is more scientific than history when you get to the direct work. This isn't to suggest that historians don't use a rigorous process but physical objects don't lie. Basic conclusions are empirical fact. For example if I found a coin when digging a ditch I would know that at the time the coin was dropped the ditch was open or backfilled. Either way it was in existence. If I find Roman pottery under a layer of burning then I know that someone left some Roman pottery there before the burning took place. This is basic archaeological stratigraphy. Scientific dating can then be used to give specific dates. We can also do a lot with skeletal remains that allow us to both date them and find out about their lifestyle and food consumption. Even to the point of knowing where they grew up by the isotopes in their remains that are linked to the water they drank. All of this evidence is reported on in a scientific manner at first. Quantified and catalogued. Later this evidence can be used to create interpretations. This evidence can also help to verify historical documents.  How you ask? Well through basic logic. The above example about the Saxons has an invasion and battles taking place. Well if that is the case we should see evidence of battles. We should also see little in the way of cultural integration. There should also be a date before which we do not have evidence for Saxons and then afterwards areas or camps that have lots of evidence. There is little to no evidence of conflict in the archaeological record. That then calls into question the document that said there was conflict. If that document is called into question then any other documents by that author also lose a certain amount of credibility and thus anything that is based on that document can also be seen to be inaccurate.  To sum up. Documents are analysed first for bias. They are then compared to other documents from the time if they are available. Archaeological evidence can then be used to confirm any of the facts or not. Obviously if there is no evidence yet for a broader concept it doesn't necessarily mean it didn't happen. ",
