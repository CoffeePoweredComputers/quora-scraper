            "answer_text": "Opium is a plant-based substance extracted from poppy. The pharmacologically significant components of opium reside in its morphine, which acts upon the central nervous system and is analgesic, narcotic and potentially addicting. If used in proper quantities, opium does have certain beneficial medical effects, such as relieving chronical pain or alleviate anxiety. But anyone who uses opium on a long-term basis will very likely start to get addicted and experience harmful side effects. Harmful effect includes, but is not restricted to, respiratory problems, heart problems, weakened immune system function, impaired cognitive functions, etc. Chronical users also tend to experience a physical dependence and increased tolerance level, which means larger doses of opium are needed to get the same effect. Apart from harmful effects of opium, historical reasons also contribute to Chinese people\u2019s lack of tolerance to opium. In Chinese history text books, for example, the opium war is mentioned and its consequences are discussed in details. The Opium war is often considered as the beginning of China\u2019s \u2018modern history of humiliation\u2019\uff08\u8fd1\u4ee3\u5c48\u8fb1\u53f2\uff09. Before the first Opium war (1839-42), China\u2019s economy was the largest in the world, but within a decade after the end of the Second Opium War (1856-60), China\u2019s share of global GDP had fallen by half. The Chinese Emperor, Guang Xu, passed many decrees against opium, but illegal trade of opium still flourished. By 1838, the number of chests of opium trafficked into China had climbed to 40,000, resulting in 10-12 million Chinese addicts. Levels of opium addiction grew so high that it even began to affect the imperial troops and the officials. Emperor Guang Xu of Qing dynasty\u2019s attempted to restrict the use of opium, but only resulted in military conflicts between China and the West, further contributing to decline of Qing Dynasty. Due to the effect of opium, the name and impression of the \u2018sick man in East Asia\u2019 (\u4e1c\u4e9a\u75c5\u592b) appeared in some western literature, films and television dramas.  In some countries, the usage of opium falls into the category of medical problems and political issues; but in China, drug abuse is a memorable historical issue as well. In Chinese, there is a saying \u5403\u4e00\u5811\uff0c\u957f\u4e00\u667a\uff0cwhich basically means learning from one\u2019s mistakes. Chinese people remember their historical past and know how much harm drugs have done to their nation. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand why Chinese political leaders impose strict law against opium and various other illegal substances. I will now proceed to provide a possible counter-argument against China\u2019s ban of opium and offer a response to it. It is sometimes believed that opium has many beneficial effects which helps people. For instance, opium can be medicine or pain killers. My response to this is that there are many legal pain killers in the market already. When a patient experiences physical pain, her doctor will prescribe her what she needs based on her situation. Available pain killers include dolantin, acetaminophen, etc. Therefore, it is not necessary to take raw opium as a pain-killer. ",

            "answer_text": "Nearly one century ago, a large quantity of poor farmers in China(no less than 10 million) were forced to crop opium to fulfill the need and greedy of warlords in China. There was no enough land for them to feed themselves and what\u2019s more, they were addicted to the opium which made them become poorer and unhealthier. Almost all of them died in starvation and the civil war between warlords. In 1949, such situation started to change due to the reform of communist. At that time opium was considered as the representative of \u201cdecay culture\u201d and an attempt of foreigners to control Chinese economy(the history of opium war proved part of it). Chinese people cannot forget the damage caused by opium even till today, which made it understandable by most Chinese to ban the opium. There are some other reasons why China ban it, for example, the difference in culture, the concern of addiction, social security and the concern of exorcism. According to some doctors in medicine, it\u2019s still unknown whether opium is harmful or not(advantages outweigh the disadvantages or disadvantages outweigh the advantages? Nobody knows clearly). But just like Doling, one kind of effective painkillers, the may cause of addiction and potential nerve damage is always bad to people\u2019s health and should be considered very careful. ",
