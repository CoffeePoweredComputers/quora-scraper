            "answer_text": "The traditional answer is technological advances developed between Spain and Italy that allowed to better navigation techniques and better ships. Various authors have began to suggest that the end of the \u201cwarm medieval period\u201d and the havoc it unleashed in the climate of Portugal, plus the murderous droughts Castile had been enduring for centuries and continued enduring still had a lot to do with it(one in the VIII century threw people into cannibalism, for reference). Essentially Castile looks big but has always had a very hard time maintaining the population, and Portugal was being hit by the change of climate badly, and Aragon was halfway. Both nations were in need of land and alternative, safer sources for food. Portugal had been making incursions/colonies in Africa since the XIV century, and got to Guinea, but even though it found Gold there, gold is not eddible. Aragon was fighting to expand on the Mediterranean and get Italy (a bit more stable cropswise) and the local comercial rutes, but there was A LOT of competition for the Mediterranean, especially the Ottoman Empire, who was kicking arse. Castile also tried/considered Northern Africa as a place to expand on, but had the same problem, the Ottomans were huge and scary, plus North Africa was not nearly as fertile as it used to and holding on to land between Africa an Iberia was, a proven by Al Andalus, hard. Morocco was not easy to take on either, let alone if it allied with the Ottomans, and to make it worse North Africa was in no condition to fix anyone\u2019s food shortage problems at that time either. Expanding over France was simply not an option because France was and is a powerhouse (Aragon still tried, to illustrate de desperation of the moment). England has a soil poor as rats. So, you have Portugal and Castile desperately looking for somewhere to expand on, somewhere to go and get resources to maintain their population, so they start exploring around like crazy and getting an interest in developing new technology for navigation. They find the Canary Islands, deeper into the sea they find the Azores. Finding America launched the age of discovery but finding it was part of the frantic efforts by west Europe, especially Iberia, to find a place to expand on and get strength from when they run out of it, they were hungry or feared they would be, and had the Ottomans cutting the Mediterranean and African expansion, looming on the horizon and (understandably) terrifying them about the possibility of a second Arab conquest. It was preceeded by various attempts and searches all around them: the XIV century Portuguese exploration of Africa,( they did not have the technology to go much further than Guinea but they were trying clearly), Aragon managing to cross the \u201cpass of fear\u201d in the XIII century (can\u2019t remember the name in English) that the Portuguese had considered impossible to sail through after various attempts (one does not continue sending his ships to impossible missions or sure death if one is not between a rock and a hard place), or the various atlantic explorations both Castile and Portugal were doing all through the XIV and XV century. Lond story short: Climate change, people was hungry in the West. They were also scared of two hughe powers growing around them (Ottomans and France) and needed a manpower to fight them they had no way to feed. Land, money, and comercial rutes badly needed. Search activated. Naval research extra funded. Castillians, Aragonese and Portuguese going all over and around and on every single current, cape and sailing surface they could find. ",

            "answer_text": "The main cause for the age of exploration, was not the fall of constantinople, let us be remembered that by that time the Portuguese where already deep into the Atlantic Ocean. Henry the Navigator\u2019s ships had found the Azores, Madeira and the coast of modern day Senegal, as early as 1444. The Spanish only started their campaigns much later. So what you must be asking is why did the Portuguese started these seafearing campaigns. Expanding Christianity - the spirit of crusade was allways present along with the idea of converting as many souls into the faith as possible.The Land of Prestes Jonh - a mythical christian kingdom standing among the Muslins and pagans of the east, it was thoroughly searched by european explorers at the time.Gold and slaves - the caravans reached north african cities full of gold, spices and slaves, the portuguese wanted to find the source, to bypass the long desert journey, with a fast sea route.A sea route to India - ever since Henry the Navigator recieved a book from his brother describing the voyages of Marco Polo, that he dreamt of a southern passage to the Indian Ocean, that would greatly reduce shiping costs and bring the spices monopoly into portuguese hands. Only many years after his death would his dream come true, when Bartolomeu Dias turned the Cape of Good Hope in 1487.",
