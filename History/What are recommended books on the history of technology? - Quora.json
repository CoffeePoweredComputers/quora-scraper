            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a difficult question to me. And I work with historians, including User-10013777016703645549 (Hi Paul!), and my science and engineering colleagues come away somewhat disillusioned with history as a topic. I have no objections to chronology, which will somewhat bore people, and I\u2019ve read many of the cited books. I\u2019ve been in some communications with James Burke following Connections (and his primary historian was Lynn White at UCLA when he was alive and held one of the highest faculty positions in the entire University of California). I think I liked his TV commentary better than his written book. I saved the different points text. Our (speaking with my colleagues) problem with historians is the attempt to oversimplify complex topics/issues/tradeoffs (engineering is about trade offs) into a linear narrative for a human point of view. I think the best response I can recall about the word comes from feminists who object to history with her-story. Technology needs it-story. I know the objections that classically trained historians make, and I\u2019ve attended SHOT (Society History Of Technology) meetings (I conclude that historians are different kinds of people than scientists and engineers). Technology is a big field. One book, which I will cite due to a colleague (DEK) which deserves more citation (I also my biases) in computing: Hackers by Steven Levy (whom I know from consequences of his book except I don\u2019t care for his publisher\u2019s subtitle which I won\u2019t cite). He (DEK) would want a case for that/him (Steven). Also less liked from professional historians are Katie Hafner\u2019s Where Wizards Stay Up Late and Bob Cringley\u2019s Accidental Empires which also produced Nerds 2.0.1 by his producer Bob Seg\u2026 So that\u2019s for computing. I know these books have errors, but errors in other books are bigger. Another cited summary is Rhodes Atomic Bomb book, which is probably a fine thick popular history (I should finish my Goodreads re-review). I had 2 quarters of classes which went into a book cited by Rhodes (Larry Badash\u2019s Reminsences of Los Alamos), again another complex topic and I had some great dinners with monster minds. Little did Larry know where our long term friendship end up (I got to the real Los Alamos a couple years ahead of him). A few things have come to light since 1986, some of which appears in Dark Sun, but other better books exist on that topic Nuclear Express written by designers (even if flawed due to problems of security and intelligence). Soul: is OK. Diamond is OK. Leo Marx is probably OK if a little annoying (read some of his writings for a class long ago). I can\u2019t stand Kevin. He really annoys me, and I think Joe Campbell somewhat annoys me. Conant is in a unique position. Have actually met her. Her 109 Palace book is important and not covered in Rhodes. In junior high school I read David Kahn\u2019s The Codebreakers. And while I\u2019ve not visited building OPS1, and I visited OPS2A and OPS2B, and other more important buildings. Get well David. Take any recommendation by Paul as a secondary endorsement from me. I started this intending no recommendations which I have real problems with the topic. Picasso\u2019s answer to people who did not understand modern art was to exclaim (paraphrased) \u201cDo you expect to understand German in a day?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Your question allows a broad range of answers. One might answer this with a general book about how key technologies were invented over the last 10,000 years; or one might answer with the story of one technology. I have a stunning answer for the latter: The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes This book details how the ideas of the atom bomb came together over a 50 year period, providing detailed histories of the scientists involved, how they came to the ideas they had, both the physics theory and the agonizing discussions about implications, and the experiments they did, in terms that laymen can understand very well. It covers the the actual construction engineering as it occurred at Los Alamos. The last chapter covers dropping of of weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the aftermath. Everything in the book up to the last chapter is a sheer pleasure to read. You will remember the name Leo Szilard forever after this book; he conceived of the notion of the chain reaction. The last chapter is a Stephen-King class horrifying read, but you cannot put it down. Highly recommended. ",
