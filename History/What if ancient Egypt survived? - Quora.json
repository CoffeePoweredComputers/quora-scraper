            "answer_text": "This is unlikely; Egypt never falls to Rome. They build up their army and eventually there is another war with Rome. They take the Middle East and Turkey. A third war leaves Rome in the hands of Egypt. Without Rome the Roman empire in Europe collapses into Celtic kingdoms. These Celtic kingdoms band together and fight against Egypt. After years of fighting, Egypt manages to take Western Europe, including Germany. Scandinavian people fear Egypt will march into their lands, They choose a leader to band themselves together. They land in Scotland to secure a bass for a future war. Egypt then lands in South England. The two don\u2019t realize the other is on the island and both fight they way North. They meet in line with Manchester. The two then have a war. Egypt loses and Scandinavia takes Britain. They then take Ireland. The two have a peace. Egypt collapses and Scandinavia takes much of their Northern empire. Scandinavia soon collapses. Nations that arise have wars which lead to a massive war, World War One/Two, where they decide that wars are not worth it and the UN is created. Also they have empires of their own, with a nation on Britain having the largest. Europe\u2019s culture has more Celtic influences, the North has a Scandinavian styled culture, while the South has a Celtic culture with a underlying Roman and Egyptian influence. ",
