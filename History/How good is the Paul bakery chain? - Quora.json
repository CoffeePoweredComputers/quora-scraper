There bread is as good as it gets and their tartelette aux framboises is my favorite.  I look forward to the day when this chain expands worldwide. ",

And the sandwiches are even better...that French Saucisson baguette with small \"cornichons\" and pure French butter called \"Le Savoureux\"...Delicious! it's my \"Welcome Home\" item every time I arrive in Paris. Or my last buy when I leave...   ",
