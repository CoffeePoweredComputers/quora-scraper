            "answer_text": "Lord Canning. The position of the Viceroy was established in the Queen\u2019s Proclamation, 1858. According to that act, the Governor General of India will get an additional title of Viceroy, who will be directly appointed by the crown. This is because, immediately after 1857, the control of India was passed from the East India Company to the British Crown. Lord Canning was the Governor General of India before 1857 and he continued as the Viceroy of India after 1857. ",
