WW2 For starters, the Germans placed emphasis on the engineering aspect of their weapons, building grand superweapons that would be deemed a feat of engineering even till this day. This was done as a means of propaganda, to portray Germany as a strong and advanced military power.  A Nazi Propaganda poster showcasing german technological military might One example of this mindset has to be the schwerer gustav, which was chambered in 800mm.  Schwewer Gustav  800mm While the Schwewer Gustav was operational, It was more of a political statement by Hitler rather than an actual tool of war.  Hitler That was roughly the German mindset during the war and It was only later in the war that they realized that wars are not won by expensive super weapons, but rather the tactics and the weaponry the standard military had access to, which were things that were both neglected by the Germans earlier in the war, as they let themselves get giddy with victory. Another nation\u2019s whose psychology could be seen in Its weapons is Japan.  Japan Japan psychological mindset was rather backwards for Its time, despite the attempts at modernising the military during the Meiji period.  Meiji period Japanese military This was why the katana, a weapon obsolete for the mid-20th century, was still in use in the Japanese military during WW2.  Katana WW2 This also can be seen in the rather late adoption of the sub-machine gun in 1940, way behind many other militaries of Its time.  1940 Japanese submachine gun This can be explained by the fact that Japan\u2019s goal in the war was one of colonisation, using the war as an opportunity to capture South East Asia\u2019s resources.  South East Asia From these two examples, It's safe to say that national psychology can alter the development of weapons. That\u2019s all folks! ",

So let\u2019s looks at those:  Germany Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ac\u2019htung, Hanz, don\u2019t go full speed, you\u2019ll break the tracks From a viewpoint of an engineer, this thing is both a marvel and a disaster. The complexity used is impressive, and a lot over-engineered, but it\u2019s also its downfall, takes too much time to build, too much time to repair, use too much fuel, weight too much and is slow. But was it great for tank vs tank? Yes. The psychology of the german was we need the best, no matter the cost, only the strongest will survive and one unit is the only one needed.  USSR t-34 (all versions) Ivan, can you also feel that breeze? The t-34 is cheap. Really, really cheap. USSR made a lot of them, and it was a shady work: steel plates were cut to size grossly, welds were made rapidly, track links weren\u2019t bolted (t-34 had anvil pieces affixed to the hull to reput in place the linking pieces as the tank move, thus the \u201cclack-clack-clack\u201d sound)\u2026 So it was not rare for them to break down before seeing battle. But! IT WAS CHEAP! And what is cheap can be mass produced more! And mass produced it was, Hitler himself couldn\u2019t grasp how the russian army was able to spade as much tank as they did. USSR philosophy was that strength is equal to number, it didn\u2019t matter if that strength was of poor quality, just add more numbers.  USA M4 (all versions) American (late) entry into the war let them observe what the other fielded and took their time to conceive their medium tank. It\u2019s reliable (mostly), can fight (poorly against stronger armor but can) and can be easily upgraded (more or less). It perform quite well against infantry, bounce a stray cannon shot here and there, but don\u2019t expect it to be able to handle a 88m to the face. Albeit slower than t-34, it can still outpace easily the tiger. It greatest strength was ease of repair and like I said, upgrade-ability. USA philosophy was not to go with number (albeit it did) like URSS, nor with strength like germany, but to have versatility. I could for other nation, but I think I would lose the usual uninterested people, so I won\u2019t bother. ",

For instance: the M4 Sherman, frequently derided, yet built in large numbers to a specification that dated from June 1940, when the best tanks in the world were thought to be the German PZKW IV. They were to be made using heavy truck drive components\u2014to avoid needing additional resources designing those components\u2014and to weigh no more than 40 tons\u2014because no winch could hoist a larger weight over the side of a ship and into a landing craft. The Army needed the vehicle fast to train the troops, develop doctrine, and build the units before the US was sucked into the war. They didn\u2019t care that it could barely defeat the PZKW IV because tank-on-tank warfare was not in US doctrine. Yeah, that\u2019s what they were thinking in June of \u201840. And there were thousands of such decisions made about nearly everything. ",
