            "answer_text": " The Eastern Front was so bloody due to the factors and elements of distance, time, ideology, dictatorial tactics, surprise, population, technology, terrain, weather and industrial capacity.  One million people died in the siege of Leningrad alone. Operation Barbarossa was the largest invasion in history. The Germans intended their armed invasion to be brief and effective, and instead it lasted almost four years. Due to the geography of the Soviet Union, the Eastern Front became longer the farther the Wehrmacht advanced; it was also the widest war front in history. The Front was lethal from Poland to Moscow, and then from Moscow to Berlin; the same ground was fought over multiple times.  The Germans had most of the advantages at first, took enormous numbers of prisoners, and let most of the Soviet POWs starve. Almost 4 million Axis troops attacked greater numbers of Soviet soldiers, and the Soviet Union sacrificed their own men readily and through poor leadership from the top. Most Red Army soldiers fought until their ammunition ran out or they died or the situation was hopeless. At the peak, some 11 million soldiers were fighting at the same time. Millions of civilians were in the way of the fighting. Surrender and retreat were discouraged by both dictators. The Nazis intentionally killed civilians. Partisan warfare took place after the front moved to the east, and the Germans took reprisals against civilians.  Modern weapon technology killed millions with tanks, rockets, artillery, machine guns, bombs, strafing, rifles, grenades and mortars; starvation and disease took additional millions.  The competing ideologies made battle fierce and atrocities too common. The industrial economies of the Axis and the Allies constantly supplied weapons to the combatants.  ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some reasons: The war is about survival to both countriesThis might be the most exterior reason. You see, with the war keep going, by the time when the Soviet-German War started, USSR is the only independent-unNazi nation on the Europe continent\u2026\u2026.except Switzerland(laughing). So, Hitler and his generals intensively believe that defeat Russia can lead to a negative condition to British, which may make the British surrender. And meanwhile, USSR was the only power which can able to defeat Germany.   Enmity is too deepSoviet Union hates capitalists who oppress and exploit works, they think Nazi is totally capitalism while Russia is an obvious communistic nation . Nazi Germany hates Slavs which is the main population of Russia. The prevailing of the nationalism at 20s century also deepen the enmity between these two nations. Q:Why the enmity make the war more booldy? A:It makes soldiers and civics fight more bravely. When towns are occupied by enemy, people may organize resistance spontaneously for their nation nad belief rather than adapt to the new owner of the city.  (Nazis use this figure to disseminate their idea that Russia is ruled by Jews) (A shadow in the shape of a general, he got a hexagram on him, it is a symbol of Jews) IndustryWhy the war is so bloody? Oh, man, just focus on the industry capability of two countries. THIS IS A WAR BETWEEN THE SECOND LARGEST INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND THE THIRD ONE!!!(As a matter of fact, it could be the largest one and the second one if we only pay attention on the groud military industry). It means that both two countries can provide a large-scale military force. As a consequnce, the battles of east front are measured with corps and armies while people use divisions in west front. \uff08weapons and factories\uff09:  (1)(Germany\u2019s airplane factories)  (Katyusha rockets)  (T-34 factories)  (Hammer of Stalin)  (panzer 6)   Gcographical conditions We can seen that the battle fields of the Soviet-Germany war are mostly plains and steppes, which benefit operatios with large amount of panzer divisions. The common tank battles also make the war bloody. The plains and steepes also make military operation larger, further and more instense. Compare with the west front with is consist with diverse indepent military operations, the operations in the east front are mostly continuous. In detail, every battle will be the prologue of the next battle. PopulationThe growth of the population will also make the war bloody by add tons of soldiers. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-CUT OFF LINE\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 will add more if I will come out with new ideas ",
