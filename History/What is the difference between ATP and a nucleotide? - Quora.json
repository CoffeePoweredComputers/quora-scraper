            "answer_text": "What is the difference between atp and nucleotide? Short answer: ATP is a nucleotide with two more phosphate groups. From Wikipedia article Nucleotide: Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids; they are composed of three subunit molecules: a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and at least one phosphate group. They are also known as phosphate nucleotides. A nitrogenous base (a.k.a. nucleobase) and a pentose (i.e., a five-carbon sugar) makes a nucleoside. Adding an inorganic phosphate group (often shortened to P[math]_i[/math]) to a nucleoside makes a nucleotide. When the nitrogenous base is adenine, the resulting mononucleotide molecule is AMP (adenosine monophosphate). From the Wikipedia article (bold emphasis added)): AMP consists of a phosphate group, the sugar ribose, and the nucleobase adenine;; it is an ester of phosphoric acid and the nucleoside adenosine. As a substituent it takes the form of the prefix adenylyl-. AMP plays an important role in many cellular metabolic processes, being interconverted to ADP and/or ATP. AMP is used as a monomer in the synthesis of RNA. Add a phosphate group to AMP, and you get ADP (adenosine diphosphate). Add a phosphate group to ADP, and you\u2019ve got ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Short cut from the Wikipedia article: ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, which indicates that it consists of three components,[math]^{[1]}[/math] a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate. \u201cMono\u201d = one, \u201cdi\u201d = two, and \u201ctri\u201d = three (phosphate groups). One picture says it all (and more):  General nucleotide structure. DNA nucleotides use the pentose deoxyribose, which does not have the extra oxygen present in ribose (see lower right in image above).

            "answer_text": "What is the difference between ATP and a nucleotide? ATP is an NTP; a nucleoside triphosphate, with the sugar ribose (if it contained the sugar deoxyribose instead, then it would be a dNTP). On the other hand, a nucleotide in an RNA strand is an NMP; a nucleoside monophosphate. NTPs are the \u2018raw\u2019 form of RNA nucleotides, but during incorporation into a growing RNA strand, the terminal 2 phosphates are hydrolyzed, leaving a nucleoside monophosphate as what gets incorporated. So ATP is the \u2018raw\u2019 form of the adenine-containing ribonucleotide, and could be incorporated into a growing RNA molecule. ",
