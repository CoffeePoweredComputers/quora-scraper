            "answer_text": "The Ancient Greeks liked to look at male bodies, so men with good bodies often wore as little as possible. They ran around naked when playing ball games, competing at sports or in the gym, or when swimming. Alexander was not an exception. Everyone wore a chiton, a rectangular garment that went over the head and was belted at the waist. There were no sleeves. It looked like a dress. It stopped at the knee for men, and went to the ground for women. (Women in Macedonia also rode horses, though, and we have no idea what they wore when they rode. If women went into battle, they wore the same kind of armor as the men.) The materials used for clothing were linen, wool and in Persia, possibly silk and cotton. Alexander famously said that his mother and sisters made his clothing. I wonder if they merely supervised. Women were supposed to sit around weaving (see Penelope in the Odyssey), but the richer one was, the less weaving one probably did. Rich Macedonians had horses, and riders wore a short woolen cloak called a chlamys that they pinned on the right shoulder. Royalty also had these odd round sunhats called kausia, which, from the front, rather look like the halos on old-timey saints. Boots were worn when riding. There were no stirrups.  This is probably an image of the young Alexander, and there is his kausia flying off of his head to the back. Even though he\u2019s shown on foot, the chlamys identifies him as a rider. Check out that long nose, same as in the mosaic below. To recap, when out riding with his friends, he wore a cloak, a dress, a hat and boots. When playing sports, swimming or running, nothing at all. (He probably wore clothes to hunt, despite the mosaic). When walking around, he wore a hat, sandals, chiton, and maybe a chlamys. He could have worn a himation instead of a chlamys, the himation is a large cloak, worn by both men and women. No one wore underpants. Clothing was dyed all sorts of colors, including yellow and sky blue, and could be striped, or have patterns woven in. The expensive purple (or maroon) dye was reserved for royalty. In battle, soldiers might have armor for the chest, and also little miniskirts made of leather strips. They had protection for the shins (extremely important. If an enemy cut your legs out from under you, you were doomed.) They wore various styles of helmets. The chest armor, or cuirass, was very strong, being made from layers of linen and glue, similar to kevlar. A soldier might add a bronze chest piece on top of the layers of linen. The cuirass opened on the side and had a couple of straps that came over the shoulders and fastened on the front. Alexander\u2019s cuirass had an image of Medusa on it, and some flashy red trim. Alexander put women into power whenever he could, and seems to have protected and admired women. Medusa was a powerful woman, who petrified men with fear. Alexander respected the power of fear, and sacrificed to Fear before battles. Wearing a frightening woman on his armor might have been a private joke, or maybe a little bit of insight into the minds of males. Soldiers wore helmets that could be plumed with feathers or horsehair, or have gold and silver adornments. There were a number of different styles of helmets. Men probably discussed the finer points of helmet protection, since they wore different styles into battle. Different adornments might have indicated rank or special merit. Bronze, silver and gold were used for the metal parts and decoration of the armor. It is said that Alexander hated the cuirass and helmet, and had to be persuaded to wear them by his generals. He put two plumes on his helmet, unlike any other general, so that his enemies could know which soldier to attack.  He probably had reddish blonde hair, but Apelles, who might have painted the original of this image, always painted Alexander with dark hair. Red hair was considered rather ugly. You can see the light irises just circling the dark pupils, which are enlarged (as is the entire eye) to show that Alexander was possessed by a god, probably Athena, who also wore a Medusa cuirass. He would have been wearing a helmet in battle, like the man behind him. In this mosaic we can see his leather skirt, cuirass over a chiton, and a chlamys over all. There is a hint of sleeve, but that could have been interpreted by the restorer. Alexander did try to introduce a chiton with long sleeves, but we don\u2019t know when. The ears and eyes of the horse show that the horse is listening to Alexander even in the midst of battle, a sign of Alexander\u2019s excellent horsemanship. You can see the edge of a leopardskin horse blanket, but there are no stirrups to help with the thrust of the spear. After claiming the title of Great King from Darius, Alexander had a problem. He was ruling Persians, who wore pants. Their shirts had sleeves. The King was also supposed to wear a tall hat, a ribbon around his head, and a long tunic. In order for the Persians to respect him, he needed to look Persian. In order for his Macedonians to respect him, he needed to look Macedonian. This was no small thing. Greeks believed that only barbarians wore pants. The Macedonian army crossed the Hindu Kush in the dead of winter in little dresses, rather than wear pants, or shirts with sleeves. His compromise seemed to be (we only have a few images): yes to sleeves, no to pants, ribbon on head, tunic and tall hat for Persian ceremonies. (The ribbon is called a \u2018diadem\u2019 and only the Great King was allowed to wear it.) The Greeks (including the Macedonians) hated his compromise clothing, because they hated the Persians, and didn\u2019t see why there should be any accommodation at all made to them. The Macedonians also had amazing gold crowns made from intricately detailed sculptures of leaves, acorns, and flowers. It is unclear when he wore those, but he did get a lot of them as gifts. He probably wore them when the army had big feast days with competitions and lots of food and wine.  The flowers on this gold crown look like myrtle, which is also the original name of Alexander\u2019s mother. It was found in a Macedonian tomb of the period.

            "answer_text": "This answer builds upon Sylvia Denlinger \u2018s answer. Read and upvote before reading mine. For Alexander we have a very good idea of what he wore in battle, because we have his father\u2019s full armour and we have the Alexander mosaic which shows Alexander wearing an almost identical thorax.  Philip\u2019s armour as it is currently exhibited in the \u039cuseum of the Royal Macedonian Tombs at Aigai*. \u201cSimilar to that worn by Alexander in the Alexander Mosaic in Pompey, the thorax was covered by purple cloth. At first sight if one disregards the luxurious decorations, it is no different from the linothorax (linen thorax - see Sylvia\u2019s answer) common in Classical Greece. In truth it is a heavy, fortified thorax, reinforced all over with wide iron plates, making it impenetrable in battle. The thorax is made of seven parts that are connected by hinges so that it opens and can be put on very easily. The inside was lined with leather for extra insulation and comfort. The characteristic double \u201cskirt\u201d made of flaps protecting the lower part of the body was also made of leather. Both the skirt and the cuirass were decorated with golden leaves bearing ornamental scenes. [\u2026] The heavy, golden golden heads used to tie the thorax were also an ornament, as well as a symbol of courage and the royal \u201c\u0391\u03a1\u0395\u03a4\u0397\u201d (virtue) of a hegemon descended directly from Hercules. On the right hand side which is left unprotected from the shield, there is a talisman, a small golden icon of Athena Promachos (Athena defender in battle) the friend and protector of mythical heroes\u201d. Translation from Greek by yours truly from the official Greek ministry of Ministry of Culture site. \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0391\u03b8\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd  And this is how he would have looked when the thorax was still bright and shiny:  Mural from Mieza, near modern day Naousa, Imathia , near the site where Aristotle taught Alexander. BTW. in case you are wondering, Philip\u2019s shield that you can see in the picture is ornamental. It is such a priceless work of art decorated with a delicate ivory sculpture of a battle between a hero and an Amazon that nobody would dare bring it to battle.   The star of the royal house of the Timenids, Alexander\u2019s family. is a part of everything and anything connected with the king. Same for the lions (inside of the shield) that are both strength, royalty and a symbol of the strongest of Greek heroes and their royal ancestor, Hercules.  Another very important and peculiar ornament found in the tomb was this, Philip\u2019s royal diadem. Because, diadems begun their existence as simple bands of cloth. Actually, the word diadem means headband. The band was tied on the brows of people participating in holly festivals or competitions (that were anyway rituals themselves). Hence, the famous Diadumenos. The kings of Macedonia, being extremely archaic in some aspects, had retained their function as high priests (remember Alexander making the sacrifices even at death\u2019s door). You see that the diadem below is a stylized depiction of a headband in silver and gold. The band is adjustable, so that it could be worn over a helmet, or a kausia, the typical Macedonian hat, which would then be called kausia diadoumenos. So, here I beg to differ with Sylvia. The diadem was not adopted from the Persians, it was a very archaic element.  For celebrations Greeks wore wreaths of leaves (usually the holy tree of the deity worshiped), but kings were a notch above the rest, therefore Philip -and surely Alexander also- wore the golden depictions of said wreaths. As descendants of Zeus they favored oak.  On less illustrious occasions, as Sylvia said, Alexander would have worn the typical ancient Greek Chiton. We actually have a depiction of a young Alexander riding his horse wearing a chiton and probably boots,  Over the Chiton he would have worn a mandyas as depicted above and also in these murals from a tomb in the outskirts of Thessaloniki. By the way, two of the soldiers are wearing plumes like Alexander liked to do. Are they perhaps officers? I can\u2019t say   I have seen some modern depictions of Mandyas, but they seem woefully thin to protect one from the cold. IMHO they were made of heavy woollen cloth, similar to what shepherds wore in the Balkans until recently.  And here I will disagree with Sylvia again. I think that Alexander was telling the truth when he said that his family made the cloth for his clothes. Maybe not the heavy work. But I can certainly see a Macedonian queen at the loom (how very Homeric indeed), only the material would be of the finest quality and the finished creation a work of art, like this purple and gold cloth again from Phillip\u2019s tomb.  *Aigai-Vergina The site (today a small Greek village one hour\u2019s drive from my hometown of Thessaloniki) was the Macedonian\u2019s first capital and the place where all major royal events, weddings, enthronements and burials took place. Philip was murdered at the city\u2019s theater (you can actually see the murder site) and was buried close by. ",
