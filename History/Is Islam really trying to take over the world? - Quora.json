            "answer_text": "I can sense this question is of the loaded variety\u2026 But I decided to drop some knowledge anyway. Maybe it will open your eyes a bit. By rough numbers there\u2019s 1,2 billion Catholics (I don\u2019t really count other fan-fiction versions of Christianity. They are basically a different religion all together and if you\u2019d count them, you might as well count Jews as Christians as well) and 1,8 billion Muslims. Islam has been the dominant power in the world for far longer than Catholic Christianity. The \u201cknowledge centre\u201d moved from Ancient Greece to colleges in Nisbis and Edessa (Turkey). And as the Great Library of Alexandria fell into disrepair (No, it did not all burn down in some catastrophic fire), and the knowledge was moved out of it, it was moved to the Islamic world as well. The Baghdad House of Wisdom was the centre of thought from the year 800 to 1200\u2019s. Then Mongols burned down the city, but some four hundred thousand scrolls were saved before the siege. In 1350 there was a Renaissance of sorts lasting all the way into the 16th century. Which is when Britain and other colonial powers started to push into the area. They were already powerful, and as later on the industrial revolution happened in Britain, it gave them immense power. Suddenly, a small nation could challange the powers of the world. They went toe to toe with China (a nation with ten times their population), the most powerful nation in the world in the 19th century. From there on, it went down for Islam and islamic scholars. What\u2019s happening in the Middle-East now is what was happening there for the past four hundred years. Western powers playing sandbox. But before that? Before Britain, Russia and the US bombed them into the stone age? They simplified writing and had access to paper (not papyrus but paper) by the 8th century. It brought with it wide spread of knowledge. Their culture emphesized the importance of acquiring knowledge. The Islamic Empire sponsored research. They translated and protected works from Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt and Phoenicia. Later they translated them into Turkish, Latin and Hebrew. Among these works were the words of Aristotle, which would later transform the latin world. Avicenna built a thought experiment to prove self-awareness. Would a blindfolded man in free fall still know he exists? They laid down the basics of Epistemology, Algebra and Arithmetic. Even algebraic geometry and the cubic equation.  They gave birth to Trigonometry and found ways to calculate the volume of a paraboloid. The scientific method is also an Islamic invention. You know, the thing where you need proof for your claims. The one which our entire scientific system uses. Ibn al-Haytham has been described as the first modern scientist. Abd Al-Rahman was the first one to notice the Andromeda Galaxy, although he didn\u2019t know what it was. Alhazen was the first one to correctly describe how the human eye detects light. Al-Biruni perfected the calculation of the Earth\u2019s radius and took it down to an error of 30 kilometers. Ibn al-Nafis was the first one to correctly describe our cardiovascular system. There were some dangerous errors in the area before that. In the nervous system, Rhazes stated that nerves had motor or sensory functions, describing 7 cranial and 31 spinal cord nerves. He assigned a numerical order to the cranial nerves from the optic to the hypoglossal nerves. He classified the spinal nerves into 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 3 sacral, and 3 coccygeal nerves. He used this to link clinical signs of injury to the corresponding location of lesions in the nervous system. Ibn Khaldun was among the founding faters of sociology and economics. They had pharmacies, and public and military hospitals. They were also the first ones to separate them into specialized units such as surgery, orthopedics and systemic diseases. The basis of modern hospitals. The first mammaplasty to manage a gyneacomastia (breast cancer) was performed by Al-Zahrawi in the 10th century. Islamic scholars and scientists helped with restoration of Spanish agriculture after the Rome fell. They helped to rebuild aquaducts, restored olive plantations, and introduced rice, bananas, lemons, carrots\u2026 As said by Bernard Lewis: \"Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Persian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution.\" This world owes a lot of what it now has to Muslims. Many of its founding stones were put there by Islamic scholars. So, if by a chance the Middle-east is left to its devices and grows back up, they won\u2019t be taking over the world. They would just join what they helped to build before the powers-that-be gave power to the ignorant to overthrow the intelligent. ",

            "answer_text": "No Islam does not want to rule the world. We muslims most of the time are working for hereafter. We invite non-muslims to Islam, because we believe our purpose of this life is to worship one God (Allah). We believe if we believe in One God (Allah) and Muhammad as the last messenger it will lead us to heaven. 1. Did you then think that We created you in vain, and that you would not be returned to us? (The Holy Quran 23:115) 2. And I created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone). (The Holy Quran 51:56) There has come to you from God a light and a luminous Book, through which God, by His grace, guides all who seek His good pleasure on the path of peace, and brings them out of the depths of darkness into light and guides them unto a Straight Path. The Holy Quran 5:15-16 Know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to one another and competition in increase of wealth and children - like the example of a rain whose [resulting] plant growth pleases the tillers; then it dries and you see it turned yellow; then it becomes [scattered] debris. And in the Hereafter is severe punishment and forgiveness from Allah and approval. And what is the worldly life except the enjoyment of delusion. (Quran 57:20) O MEN! Be conscious of your Sustainer, and stand in awe of the Day on which no parent will be of any avail to his child, nor a child will in the least avail his parent! Verily, God\u2019s promise [of resurrection] is true in\u00addeed: let not, then, the life of this world deludes you, and let not [your own] deceptive thoughts about God delude you! - (Quran 31:33) O men! Verily, God\u2019s promise [of resurrection] is true indeed: let not, then, the life of this world delude you, and let not [your own] deceptive thoughts about God delude you! (Quran 35:5) So in conclusion, we don\u2019t want to rule the world, we just want all humans should believe in God and go to heaven forever. Best Regards ",
