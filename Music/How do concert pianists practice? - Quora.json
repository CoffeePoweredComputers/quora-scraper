            "answer_text": "There are two phases of practicing that are distinct and which every performing pianist goes through, whether they realize it or not. An easy way to understand these two phases is to imagine a hypothetical situation about cars. Let\u2019s say that your dream is to drive a car. But the problem is that you have to build your own car from scratch because there are no car dealers anywhere near you (remember, hypothetical!). So you spend many years of your life, building all the different parts of a car, learning about combustion, engineering, electricity, aerodynamics, etc. After 10 years of work, your creation reaches a stage where the car drives! And then you take it out on the road. Of course, you\u2019ll keep tinkering with the car during this period when you\u2019re driving it, but eventually you\u2019ll just be maintaining it, giving it gas or electricity, occasionally changing a part. Most importantly, you\u2019ll wake up every morning knowing your car is in the garage, waiting for you to drive it. Now you can think about where you want to go. You spent 10 years as a builder, now you spend the rest of your life as a driver. This is an important mind shift that needs to happen. If you think of yourself as a car builder after your car is built, then you are spending your time taking apart your car and putting it back together again. If you think of yourself as a driver, you\u2019ll take the car out for a ride to a place that you want to visit. And if there is a problem with the car, you fix it, but then you get on with the driving. Playing the piano at a professional level is very similar. There are two phases: the building phase, which goes from the beginning until some adult age, often in the 20s, but possibly earlier or even much later. You\u2019re building the nervous system, the muscular system, the sensory systems, the emotional systems. Then comes the driving phase, from that adult age forward. You research your repertoire, you build audiences, you explore your interests. The goal of each phase is very different, and therefore the practicing routines will be very different as well. I used to practice 5 hours a day. Now I practice 2 hours every other day. That transition did not come without a certain amount of pain and resistance, but now I understand why it had to happen. ",

            "answer_text": "As a concert pianist, having played many solo piano recitals, I'd just like to shed some insight on how I approach piano practice, because it's often very misunderstood. Now I'm definitely not the greatest pianist out there; the tradition of piano playing has a long rich history, and there are many absolutely incredible living and non-living pianists out there to learn from. I figured giving a little bit of insight from someone who does play professionally though and has worked on some of the more difficult piano music in the literature would help. First of all, I will have to say that for me personally and for many of my friends and colleges who are also at a high level of piano technique, a \u201cstandard\u201d practice routine is counter-productive. When I practice, I use a method that involves tackling very small sections of a particular piece of music at a time, switching what I'm practicing around a lot, and taking lots of breaks between different sections. For example, I may practice the right hand of a particularity difficult passage of one piece of music, then practice the left hand of another passage of a different piece of music, in both cases focusing directly on this one section of music, with no real concern for the rest of the piece in this particular moment. I then would take a break from practicing those sections, and work on a group of other smaller sections, only returning to the previous section the next practice section. I then slowly begin to piece together all the little sections of each piece of music until I can play the piece all together, then I can focus on dynamics and making it sound musical, and fixing little technical errors that may crop up (This part takes a lifetime, because there is never a time where a piece will be 100% perfect and complete, there will always be things you can work on to make it sound better. I like to think of each piece of music as a flower that constantly needs watering.). This gradual process of learning a piece may seem slow, but a person can learn a piece of music in a surprisingly quick and efficient manner by doing this, because instead of trudging through the music from the beginning and trying to work through mistakes and constantly repeating and stopping and starting, you're tackling each section head on from the start. You're also not following a long time consuming routine of warmup, then scales, then slow play, etc. So instead of having a set \"routine\" or \"schedule\" like many piano students have, I instead focus on what I want to work on at the time that I feel needs the most work. That's not to say I don't have goals, and don't organize what I want to be working on at any given time, but I focus my practicing on what I need to accomplish in the moment, and take it piece by piece. I've also observed this practicing behavior in a lot of other pianists that have reached a high level of mastery. Each moment of practice is different. I find when I'm not thinking so much about how the full piece is going to sound, I have much more of a drive to complete it. To use a metaphor, think about having to walk many miles. It's going to be a lot more pleasurable if you just think of the moment and each individual step instead of constantly thinking of how long it's going to take you to reach your destination, then before you know it you've arrived. The quote \"a thousand mile journey begins with one step\" comes to mind. When you focus on each step of a piece and just enjoy what you're doing in the moment, learning a piece of music becomes not only efficient but enjoyable, then you before you know it you can play the entire piece of music. Then the act of working to make that learned piece of music beautiful and musical is a lifelong journey and for me extremely enjoyable and rewarding experience. I'm very aware that not everyone will take this approach, and there are no doubt lots of virtuosi that do follow a standard routine, or some other routine. People are different and learn in different ways, I can only describe my experiences and the experiences of others I've gotten to know.  Hope this was helpful! ",
