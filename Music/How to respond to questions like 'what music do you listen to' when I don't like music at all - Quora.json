            "answer_text": "hi. yeah. i know how you feel pretty much. however,  in my personal opinion, it roots to things much deeper than mere 'music' per se. lets generalise it a bit by labeling it as 'sounds' instead. i strongly believe that this universe comprises of different frequencies that make up to its totality. if you ask musician or a sound engineer,  they know that every sound that we hear will have its individual frequency (musical chord,  if you will) for example,  your mothers car honking might be in F#, whereas the sound of your neighbor's poodle might be Cb. i also believe that,  a human with even a hearing disability can sense (how else Mozart can create masterpieces even though he cannot hear a sound?) the different vibration that a human body perceive as a 'coded' information. what i am trying to go about here is,  even though we consider conventional music repulsive, we can still appreciate our mothers lull us to sleep when we were babies,  or enjoy the sound of rustling leaves and waterfall thundering. after all, its all just the music of this universe, dont ya agree? it was believed that the hindu priest's chanting in sanskrit as 'hommm' is actually signifying a spectrum of combination from the first sanskrit alphabet, 'ha'(the highest note), and the last,  'om'(the lowest) ..i believe there was an ancient science of this knowledge,  for instance,  mr a might be the best friend of mr b simply because their frequency are similar to each other,  and mr a's arch enemy mr c have the opposite value..  it might be just mumbo-jumbo, but for a layman like me,  i dont want to reject music totally,  and just embrace it as part of our universe.  so,  back to the issue at hand, you dont even need to answer the particular question at all you see - but just for argument sake,  wouldnt it be nice to really know,  if there really is 'music x' that we still have not heard out there,  that turns out to be OUR FAVOURITE SONG? who knows?  cheers.

            "answer_text": "You respond truthfully. Okay, sure, not liking music means you have one topic less to talk to people about, but so what? There are a million and one potential topics for conversation, and not liking any one of them isn't going to be a severe handicap while socializing. Hi, I think Game of Thrones is incredibly boring and consequently have never seen more than the first 4 episodes of the first season, so if someone wants to talk about GoT, then I'm the wrong person for that. I don't see why that should offend anyone unless you said that anyone who likes music must be an idiot or something like that. If someone talks to me about GoT, I tend to say something like: \"I've heard of it, and I watched a couple of episodes, but I didn't end up liking it all that much.\" I haven't yet met anyone who's been offended at that. (although I've met a few people who have tried to convince me that it's the greatest show ever) Redirect the conversation instead; if you're at a social occasion and someone asks you about your favourite music; say something like: \"I don't really have a favourite band; but I'm a huge fan of movies; what is your favourite movie?\" and then talk about that instead. Trying to pretend that you're a good person to talk about music to when in reality you're not, isn't going to lead to anything positive. You don't really want fake friends anyway; you want real friends, friends who knows the actual you and who like you for being the person you are; not the person you pretend to be. ",
