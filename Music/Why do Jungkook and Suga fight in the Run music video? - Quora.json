            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 hahahah how can I answer this. The thing is, there is so many interpretations around this fight scene. My interpretation and how I see it is like this: We know that every member is linked to one another, except Jin because he is the pivotal character in this storyline. He is the main character that runs this whole story. RM is linked to Taehyung. Jimin is linked to J-Hope, and Jungkook is linked to Suga. So the fact that they were fighting is no coincidence, but why you ask? Well it is hard to tell\u2026 but I think that JK and Suga might be lovers. If you look at them in the MV\u2019s (RUN, I need U) they are very touchy. They were very happy together and all until something started to bother Suga. He began to be more upset and angry. Then he turns to alcohol and gets so drunk that he becomes violent. Suga is getting mad and is breaking stuff and JK is trying to stop him, but that turns into a fight between they two. Later on Jungkook is walking alone and gets hit by a car and dies. So now Suga is alone sitting on a bed in a motel room. He is lying in bed and stoking his arm on the pillow besides him. (My theory here is that that reminds him of how he and jungkook used to cuddle) you can also see JK\u2019s shirt hanging in the motel room. Anyways, Suga is devastated about JK\u2019s death and he burns down the room and dies too. I hope you understood my theory. But again we are not sure what the fight means, this is just my point of view:) ",
