            "answer_text": "Van Halen filmed \u201cJump\u201d video for $600 USD. This was on film. They had friends with the gear who worked in the industry who were willing to do it on the cheap, to get some credibility in the industry\u2026 part of their \u201creel\u201d to show prospective clients. \u201cWe shot the VH video \u2018Jump\u201d.\u201d If you already own a 1080p capable camera and appropriate video editing software, and can lip sync while filming (assuming you will be singing on camera), then there should be no problem coming in under a hundred bucks. You\u2019ve already bought the gear. The key here is \u201cprofessional\u201d. To produce a professional looking, and professional quality video takes time and a lot of \u201cfilm\u201d, which is to say, you have to shoot a lot of footage and learn what is needed to make it look professional. You have to learn what goes into a professionally produced video. Do you understand lighting?Do you understand F stop settings?Do you understand staging?Do you understand cinematographic elements?Do you understand balance of elements within the frame?Do you understand framing your subject? And these are just a few of the questions a professionally shot video considers, and includes as part of the process. Do you have a vision of what the video should look like, the atmosphere and appearance? Do you know how to create that? (Staging, lighting, F stop, balance, framing\u2026 and wardrobe if applicable) Of course you can learn all this. That takes time, of course. Then there is the sound. Do you understand how to put the sound together, to do the lip sync on film, and then in the video editing process (assuming everything, from \u201cfilming\u201d to editing is digital). Again, once you understand all this stuff, you can actually produce a video for $100 USD, if you own all the equipment, and do everything yourself, so incur no expenses in hiring people to do the work. But, if you don\u2019t, you have to buy the camera capable of professional level image capturing (filming). Are you going to want multi-camera shooting? You\u2019ll need two to three of them. Yes, you can rent them, but that blows your $100 cost through the roof. You\u2019ll need professional level audio capture if there is any on screen dialogue not related to the song. This will require you to buy SMPTE capable cameras and audio gear that can sync to SMPTE standard\u2026 if you want a guaranteed \u201clock\u201d when editing the video and audio together so it works right. Again, that blows your $100 cost. And then, if there are sound effects or foley requirements, you\u2019ll have to learn to understand how to do all that. You will have to spend a decent amount of money on a quality video editor, too. You don\u2019t need Final Cut Pro. Premier Pro is a clone, and works quite well, by Adobe, and is less than half the cost of Final Cut, and can be used on a PC, cheaper than a Mac. If you spend around five grand on cameras, lighting, computer, software, audio gear and such\u2026 yep, you can produce a $100 video, when you do everything yourself. Now, if you just want to try to shoot a video with 1080p capable cameras, with a boom box playing the audio you can lip sync to, and then edit it on cheap software, you may be able to spend only $100 on the whole shoot front to back, including editing. But you\u2019ll have to already own the equipment, or be able to borrow everything from someone who does, and who doesn\u2019t mind you using their gear and software. I film my own video. But it took time to acquire the equipment and learn to get the lighting correct. The audio was never a problem for me (recording engineer), I know tricks you don\u2019t. And it took time for me to learn to edit the footage. Oy! That was actually a lot of work. But it was fun. So, there\u2019s a bit of a rambling dialogue here in this answer, but consider what is being said here. Yes, you CAN do it. But that $100 cost really isn\u2019t as accurate as you think. A decent camera alone will be 400 bucks or so. And that alone blows the cost by 4 times. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure how you would define \u201cprofessional\u201d, but the obvious answer is \u201cno\u201d. It\u2019s not unusual to spend tens of thousands of dollars making a music video, between the sets, makeup, costumes, camera team, production crew, editors and caterers. Nobody would be likely to spend that kind of money if they could get the same results for $79.95! I think you have a choice between lowered expectations and a bigger budget, if you expect to get professional results. ",
