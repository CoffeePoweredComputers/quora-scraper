            "answer_text": "(I hope no one leaves) First, it will probably be one of the Chinese members. Chinese entertainment companies work really hard to recruit kpop idols after they get famous. They usually offer them a ton of extra money to leave their korean companies and and promise them acting work and fame in China. They also pay for their legal fees to get them out of their korean contracts. This is why so many Chinese kpop idols end up suing their companies and leave. They literally prey on kpop idols. (Hangeng SuJu, Chris EXO, LuHan EXO, Tao EXO) Lay admitted to companies trying to scout him but swore not to leave.One of the other foreign members. SM has a history of not keeping up with foreign work visas. This ends up costing the artist extra money in fees and fines. This also causes the idol to have to fly home several times at there own expense because SM didn\u2019t do their job. Past foreign SM artists have publicly complained about it \u2026 Amber F(X), Henry SuJuM, Hangeng SuJu, Chris EXO.last but.. anyone who wants to be an actor. SM has a history of forcing idols to turn down acting work because the role doesn\u2019t fit the image of the group (even when they\u2019re not busy promoting). I\u2019m not saying they dont let them act, but SM is really picky about what acting jobs or outside of SM work they can take. And if an idol dreams of being an actor that can be frustrating\u2026 (SM idols that have very publicly complained about this.. No Minwoo TRAX, Kibum SuJu, Chris EXO, Luhan EXO, Amber F(X), Sulli F(X), JaeJoong TVXQ, JunSu TVXQ, YooChun TVXQ and for Jessica SNSD.. they didn\u2019t want her to start her fashion brand and forced her out)",

            "answer_text": "NCT will probably not lose any members at this period of time since they have only debuted for 4 years. Plus, I think SM has been learning from their mistakes with luhan, wyf, and hzt, so the Chinese members are getting better treatment. However, there might be members who want to leave to pursue another career. In my guess the first will be Winwin, is very popular in China, he\u2019s probably the most popular member of NCT there, followed by members of Wayv. Therefore, if he were to leave NCT, it would be easy for him to land an acting career or sign with another label. The same goes for Lucas, idols eventually reach a point in their career where they would be better off leaving the idol industry and focus on their own work/ acting.Ten, before ten joined wayv he had a lot of solo activities, and many guess that he would branch off and become a soloist, which I can certainly see why. He\u2019s an ace and is incredibly talented.Jaehyun, the reason behind this is that I think he would become an actor in the future after he leaves NCT since his looks certainly fit the Korea beauty standards, and he looks a lot like a kdrama lead. recently, he already accepted a role in a drama (I forgot the name lol).**** In no way am I wishing NCT members to leave NCT, these are all just assumptions, please do not take this seriously!!
