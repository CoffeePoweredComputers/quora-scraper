What do I mean by that? \u201cEverything\u201d means good and bad taste are both reflected. B) The business model of Radio in that period was budgeted for \u201c Payola\u201d ( pay for play) and the door that left open to the record Company Labels. That about covers it. C) Payola has not retreated, it is alive and well in the form of enormous budget line for The three (3) Labels that control 2/3 to 80 % of the music that gets played and purchased via pact Membership offerings to large conglomerates by the largest radio station chains for playlist adds. D) Guess whose machine controls the taste of the US exports to the world? Record execs, attorneys , Cpa and their radio and streaming marketing budgets. There is a trend toward more signifigant influence increases in public taste reflections on channel outlets such as youtube and streaming plays , commercial media synch placement etc. Just my two cents.

            "answer_text": "Having read other responses, I'll toss in my two pennies. A great big chunk of 60's music was simply amazing. I mean, really good. So good it's still awesome good. Then there was what I called fake leather 60\u2019s music. The Shaggs, The Goldbriars, Eternity's Child, and Patty Duke. Yes THAT Patty Duke. Some people shouldn't sing, ever. Even John and Yoko gave us both bad music and abysmal nudity at the same time. Lots of manufactured wannabes who were in far over their heads tried for airplay and drowned. We saw a lot of one hit wonders, but even more no hit I wonder what happeneds. ",
