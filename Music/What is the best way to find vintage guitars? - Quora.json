            "answer_text": "Am I missing something because I saw nothing in the question referring to a 59 LP? I buy and sell guitars all the time and have had well over 500 over the years and it is getting harder to find good vintage guitars and when you do depending on what you are looking for the prices are all over the place. I have found them on eBay and Buy & Sell Music Gear Online and those have been the best 2 sites I have found guitars on. You can filter the results by narrowing it down to vintage guitars. If you are looking for something very specific and are willing to pay for it then check out the Gruhn Guitars. They are in Nashville and specialize in vintage instruments. Gruhn Guitars There is a site that has a lot of vintage guitars listed for sale but I have not personally bought anything off that site but they have some nice guitars listed. http://www.vintageguitarsforsale.org/ If you are like me and like vintage made in Japan guitars it is a bit harder but there are sites that specialize in these as well but most are sites in Japan.

            "answer_text": "I am a guitar collector owning more than 20 guitars and actively trading my portfolio ;).Ebay is a an important source. Consider that it offers immense buyer protection. You can ALWAYS claim for a damaged/poor instrument and send it back. Of course you don't have the chance to compare the guitar before purchasing it and it wouldn't be fair to give it back just because it doesn't match the tone you are expecting.It is very transparent and the prices are set as it was a perfect market. If you are looking for cheap deals than Ebay won't offer you much unless you look for unknown models.On the other hand Ebay is expensive and problematic for the seller. Craiglists are cheaper and offer the chance to try the guitar. The cons is that choice is limited and you may need to travel. If you are looking for a '59 Les Paul at bargain price than knock at doors. Literally. Get around middle sized towns and ask for guitars to buy. ",
