            "answer_text": "Being in an EV company I can share some information on this. We have Electrical engineers : for fast and on board charger, motor controller, motor design, simulation and development Chemical engineers: battery pack and cell design, modeling and testing Thermal engineers: thermal modeling and thermal management of different vehicle components Mechanical engineers : for designing every individual component and vehicle Embedded engineers : for hardware, software and testing Including all we have CAE engineers, thermal engineers, embedded engineers, vehicle simulation engineers, design engineers, software and hardware design engineers, power electronic engineers, quality control, proto development engineers, emi/emc engineers, system architect and integration engineers, harness development engineers, testing engineers etc. All these people are from basic engineering branches mentioned above with specialized skills in specific areas. With my experience I can say that one doesn't have to be from a specific engineering branch to work in EV industry, if you have the right expertise and knowledge your engineering branch doesn't matter much.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d follow Tim Kulogo\u2019s advice, or go for chemistry or chemical engineering if batteries interest you. The electrical aspects of a vehicle like a Tesla aren\u2019t really very radical, other than the batteries. That\u2019s where innovation is. John Corey is correct that in many (but not all) engineering programs, you just take engineering core classes in your first year. It\u2019s more important to succeed than to be in a particular major; a high level of mastery (and good GPA) trumps a low level of mastery in the \u201cright\u201d field; there\u2019s no form of engineering that doesn\u2019t touch the automotive world. Note that you may not begin in the automotive world. It\u2019s competitive. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t end up there later. Good luck! ",
