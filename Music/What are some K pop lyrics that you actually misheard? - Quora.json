It\u2019s still very similar so I don\u2019t consider this a horrible fail. 4. \u2018Me\u2019 - CLC  About a week ago I realized that CLC was saying \u201careudaumi me yeah\u201d instead of \u201cme up\u201d. I was extremely sad about this discovery. 5. \u2018Picky Picky\u2019 - Weki Meki  For Elly\u2019s verse, I heard, \u201cI don\u2019t lie, I don\u2019t lie\u201d but she was actually saying: \u201cI don\u2019t like, I don\u2019t want\u201d. And of course, \u201cDig a wall like fire\u201d. ~flav.r ",
