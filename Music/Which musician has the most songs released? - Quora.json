            "answer_text": "Buckethead went through a phase recently where he released a new album in his Pike series almost every three days. Each album was about 30 minutes long usually with two or three tracks. I don\u2019t know how far he got but I think the Pike series cleared 200. He has his regular albums as well but that output is more normal. Rick Wakeman also had a succession of albums coming out over many years. I think he has well over 40 studio albums. I should check. Yes, Wikipedia says Buckethead has 306 albums. Rick Wakeman has over 100 album releases though some are live or special releases. Well, much of the material is not songs. These two do a lot of instrumental work. But it is an impressive output. ",
