            "answer_text": "The original score for Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992, directed by Francis Ford Coppola) created by Polish classical composer Wojciech Kilar. It's opulent and dark in many places, such as the main theme and tracks such as \"The Vampire Hunters,\" though there are also more light-hearted and even hopeful elements in pieces like \"Lucy's Party\" and \"Ascension.\" I really like Kilar as a composer, particularly the music he created for Polish movies and television, which was catalogued on the out-of-print album \"Film Music.\"  ",
