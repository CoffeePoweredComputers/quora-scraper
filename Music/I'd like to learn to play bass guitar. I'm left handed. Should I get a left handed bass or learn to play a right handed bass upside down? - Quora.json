            "answer_text": "When I was young, I played a mean tennis racket. I mean, I shredded. Jumped all over the couch pretending to be Ace Frehley. And I played it lefty. When I started taking guitar lessons, my teacher advised me to try first to learn to play righty. He cited not only the availability of instruments, but the ability of a teacher to teach, and a student to learn by watching, as reasons for bucking my natural tendencies. And almost 30 years later, having taken his advice I can say he was right.  I'm not saying you can't learn lefty, or inverted righty, but the repertoire for any instrument is informed by how it's played, for instance, the chords we're accustomed to hearing from a guitar are voiced the way they are based on the notes available to the player in a given  tuning and position. You may find it easier to play songs you already know if the instrument you play is played the same as the one on the recording. That said, guys like Jimmy Haslip and Stan Sargent have made great careers for them selves and great music for listeners playing inverted righty instruments, and few would assert that playing lefty hinders Paul McCartney in any way. Ultimately it comes down to your  own comfort, and what feels most natural. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "At the end of the day, play which ever way feels right to you, but I will suggest keeping an open mind toward \u201cstandard\u201d right hand focused bass guitar rather than left handed bass and here\u2019s why. I\u2019m left handed as well and playing right handed bass makes sense to me because the left hand is the hand that\u2019s going to be doing the brunt of the work when it comes to bass playing. The left hand, in this setting, needs to be able to move each finger independently and comfortably from fret to fret while staying nimble and smooth. Because I\u2019m left hand dominant, I feel most comfortable trusting the most difficult motor skills to the dominant hand. The right hand, the weaker hand, only has to do 1 thing, pluck, and even that can be changed out with a pick. Even if you do pluck, at the bare minimum, you can play like James Jamerson and Jack Bruce and use one finger. I\u2019m not sure how dominant with either hand you are or how \u201chardcore lefty\u201d you might be, but don\u2019t feel like just because you\u2019re left handed, you need to play bass like Paul McCartney does: with a left handed or \u201creverse\u201d bass. Give a shot to \u201cstandard\u201d bass, before you start ruling things off. See what works for you. You certainly wouldn't be the first lefty bassist to play righty. ",
