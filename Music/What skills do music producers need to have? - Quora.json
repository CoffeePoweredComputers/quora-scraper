            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very unique skillset. 1. Patience is key Learning to produce music in any genre can be daunting. Making good beats is not easy when you first start. It\u2019s going to take time. A lot of the music you make in the beginning most likely won\u2019t sound that good. But after a lot of practice, they\u2019ll definitely get better. It\u2019s going to take a lot of patience to get through this process.  You\u2019ll also need to learn how to operate efficiently in a DAW. Finding the right one may take time. And once you find one you\u2019re comfortable with, you\u2019ll need to learn how to make it work for you. Some producers act as engineers, and record/mix vocals for artists. This means you\u2019ll need to spend time learning mixing technique. 2. Soft Skills As I mentioned earlier, as a producer you\u2019ll have the opportunity to work directly with artists in the studio. So naturally, you\u2019ll need to develop the necessary skills to communicate with them, especially while they\u2019re in the booth recording (time is money!). Each artist has a different personality and background. They don\u2019t all think the same way. Some of the artists I\u2019ve dealt with will come in the studio with their lyrics ready, hop in the booth, and knock it right out. Especially the seasoned ones. But other artists require more hand-holding.  I\u2019ve had to act as a psychologist for newer artists that lacked confidence. They required more motivation and direction. I had to show them where to add their ad-libs, how to stack vocals when to punch in. Whereas other artists can be very confident, some even arrogant, and you have to fall back and literally get out of the way, and let them do their thing. Developing soft skills will enable you to read the room, and determine what the artist's needs quickly. This will make you a more efficient producer and artists will love you for it. 3. Humbleness You\u2019ll have to be very humble, especially at the beginning of your journey to being a great producer. There will be times when you\u2019ll hear a track on the radio, or see a video on YouTube and be inspired to make a similar beat. But once you\u2019re done with the beat you\u2019ll see that it doesn\u2019t sound like the track you heard on the radio. This feeling can be demoralizing for any producer. You\u2019ll feel like all the hard work you\u2019re putting in isn\u2019t getting you anywhere, and ask you questions like: \u201cWhat is that producer doing to get that sound?\u201d\u201cWhy does that producer\u2019s drums knock so hard and mine don\u2019t?\u201d\u201cHow did that producer do that drop?\u201d You\u2019ll have hundreds of questions. It takes humility to tell yourself you\u2019re not that dope of a producer yet and that you will have to keep grinding every day until you get the sound you want. It takes humility to study other producers and learn instruments, find qualified mentors. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. But it is POSSIBLE! And you when you humble yourself you\u2019ll find that doors will open for you faster and you\u2019ll even progress at a higher clip. Producers need to have an abundance of skills. But just keep it simple. Make beats every day and surround yourself with people that will motivate you and be positive. Everything else will take care of itself. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "A lot! It takes years of experience to be good at it. In hip hop. It\u2019s not just creating an arrangement for a rappers song. It\u2019s your vision on the overall sound. Sonically! It\u2019s up to you on mixing and mastering. Like who\u2019s gonna do it. Are you gonna do it. Find a pro. Depends on how business is worked out. Who\u2019s gonna fund that song to completion. Now days. A producer is a jack of all trades. It\u2019s a job, with other jobs inside of it. One of the most important is learning how to arrange the song. Or instrumental. You can learn how to engineer your production. But, starting out. I would have a pro do it. In rock or any genre that works as a band. It\u2019s different. You have to know what mics to use. Drum kits, everything. Because here. Your not the one creating an arrangement for a band unless they ask. If it\u2019s a 4 member group. One person probably wrote the whole thing. And the other musicians composed what they are gonna do. Or the songwriter does the arrangement sometimes. But in this case. They need you, the producer. To record, mix and master their song to the best quality possible. You barely compose an arrangement for them. In hip hop. You always do this. Lol. Matter of fact. You do it first. Hope this helped. ",
