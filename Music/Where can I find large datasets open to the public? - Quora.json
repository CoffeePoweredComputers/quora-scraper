This link list, available on Github, is quite long and thorough: caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets You will see many census data sources listed. Then the challenge becomes how to get to what you really want and can use.  Note that this list also references a Quora answer that also includes a long list: Where can I find large datasets open to the public? For your convenience, I've copied the list of lists as it stood in January 2015 here, but won't be updating it: Awesome Public Datasets This list of public data sourcesare collected and tidyed from blogs, answers, and user reponses. Most of the data sets listed below are free, however, some are not. Other amazingly awesome lists can be found in theawesome-awesomeness andanother awesome list.
