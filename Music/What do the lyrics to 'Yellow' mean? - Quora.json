            "answer_text": "This is a poignant song for me at a very sad time. \"Yellow\" is a song by the British band Coldplay for their debut album, Parachutes (2000) that was written in the studio while they were recording. One night after recording \"Shiver\", the band took a break outside, the lights and stars outside looked amazing. Chris Martin was inspired by the sight a chord pattern popped into his head. and while not taken seriously he played the tune to rest of the band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice. The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice. Bass player Guy Berryman came up with the opening line \"Look at the stars\". Martin later titled the song \"Yellow\" as a reference to a friend who was in the studio who was wearing yellow . That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it. Yellow (Coldplay song) - Wikipedia In November 2011, Chris Martin told Howard Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck with him for a bit then in a Neil Young voice he sang \"look at the stars\". Martin went on to further explain that the word \"yellow\" has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change yellow to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word \"L\" just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just to move on to the next question. Martin applauded Stern saying \"I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'.\"  ",

And I see/ hear a love no longer and the yellows that were (good) the yellows that arnt(bad) and the yearning yellows that hind site can bring upon oneself. ",
