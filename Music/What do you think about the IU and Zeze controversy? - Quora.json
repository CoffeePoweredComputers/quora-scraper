            "answer_text": "It made me realize that IU is really the golden goose of Loen (IU's agency). Read this article from allkpop: When IU and Chang Kiha made their relationship public, some people may have been not too happy about the news, the unhappiest of them being Loen's stockholders, as the stock price fluctuated vastly from the two's dating news.  When news of their relationship was confirmed on October 8, Loen's stock immediately went into red, the market value of the company decreasing a whopping 126.4 billion KRW (~$110.7 million USD). Further, compared to the previous closing price of 75,300 KRW (~$66 USD), Loen's stock, which had risen 1,200 KRW (~$1.05 USD) ) to record a price of 76,500 KRW (~$67 USD), plummeted as soon as articles were released reporting IU's relationship. The stock price, which had dropped as low as 72,000 KRW (~$63 USD), began falling even more steeply around 1:30pm on the same day, which was when IU herself admitted her relationship with Chang Kiha.  The stock kept plummeting, down to 70,300 KRW at one point, and Loen's market capitalization decreased $110.7 million USD. Investors, who had deemed IU's dating news a negative factor, had sold their shares before the stock price fell even further.  Thankfully, Loen's shares stabilized after some time, and the price closed at 72,500 KRW (~$63 USD) per share. The stock has been performing very well in 2015 as back in January, the stock traded at around 44,000 KRW (~$38 USD) per share.
