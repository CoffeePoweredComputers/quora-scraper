            "answer_text": "I assume you are looking for someone who does the same sort of things with her voice, not someone with a similar pitch, timbre etc.  Look for jazz recordings of female artists to hear the same kind of runs and attitude that Ms. Winehouse infused her songs with.  I would suggest Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Simone, Sarah Vaughan, Billy Holiday, Etta Jones, Paula West to name just a few.  If you like that fusion of jazz and pop, try Duffy or Adele.  If you want something even more towards the pop/R&B side, try Macy Gray or Erykah Badu.   Here are a few songs to look at: Nina Simone - SinnermanPaula West - The SnakeBilly Holiday - SugarEtta Jones - My Gentleman FriendSarah Vaughan - Whatever Lola WantsElla Fitzgerald - Bewitched Bothered and BewilderedDuffy - RockferryAdele - Rumor Has ItMacy Gray - I TryErykah Badu - Hey Sugah ",

            "answer_text": "You are right in saying that it is impossible to find someone with the same voice as Amy Winehouse. She had the most unique voice and it is a shame that she didn\u2019t have enough time to use it for longer! Winehouse was very influenced by jazz and soul music and she did study jazz music for a while and you can hear it in her music: the rhythms and chords she uses are very jazz-infused, as well as her singing style. So I would say that these classic jazz singers are ones to enjoy as I thoroughly enjoy listening to them as I thoroughly enjoy listening to Amy Winehouse: Nina SimoneElla FitzgeraldBillie HolidayAretha FranklinOf course these singers won\u2019t have the same voice as Amy, but the styles are similar and they are amazing musicians in their own right. I hope these are singers you will come to enjoy! ",
