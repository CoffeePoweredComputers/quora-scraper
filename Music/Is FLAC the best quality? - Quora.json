            "answer_text": "So many questions that fail to understand the basics. FLAC is the best known example of a lossless codec. \u201cLossless\u201d in this case means that, when decided, this format yields the same bits as the original uncompressed digital source, which are reproduced into sound identically to the original.. So, for a given digital source, you can't do better than FLAC, though you can do exactly as well with other lossless codecs or, indeed, with the original digital source itself. Does this make a particular FLAC file the \u201cbest quality\u201d? Not necessarily \u2014 since FLAC yields an exact duplicate of a given original, it's always possible that there is a better original \u2014 a source master file encoded with a better ADC from the same analog master, or a high-resolution format recording derived from the same original master as the digital source from which the CD version that became the FLAC source. Of course these better originals could, in turn, be encoded into FLAC, or some other lossless codec, again with perfect fidelity, so this last distinction is more semantics than anything else. ",
