            "answer_text": "All software is made of numbers. Anyone can edit those numbers. Those edits may not mean anything and may stop the program from loading or running but anyone can make changes. The same is true of Windows apps, Mac OS apps, iOS apps. To stop this from happening we can use encryption to digitaly sign apps. You can still edit the application but the operatiting system will not let it run. Editing numbers is hard so there are programs that decompile apps to make them easier to edit. Depending on how the app was made some are easier to decompile than others. This means that some apps are easier to edit than others. Hope this helps. ",
