            "answer_text": " Above is a photo from 2005 of my home recording setup. A laptop with Cool Edit Pro 2.0, a Line 6 POD, headphones, and awful multimedia speakers. What you cant see is a 25 key MIDI keyboard and a few guitars. This was right after my college years and to keep myself sane when I wasn't working doubles at the hospital, I slowly started investing in a few things to record songs in my apartment. Now, I had been in bands through high school and we even went into real studios and recorded. Often they were great places to work but sometimes things weren't always done the way we wanted them to be. Prices for studio time also seemed to vary. Usually it was about $300 a day or so. Other times it was upwards of $700 - $1100 or more.    Now heres a picture from about 4 years ago. This is in my basement and I've upped my quality of equipment considerably. In the 10 years between the two photos, I have upgraded my computer, added 2 pairs of studio monitors, a better MIDI controller, an upgraded audio interface, and some hardware to go with it. In that 10 years I produced and released 3 albums and had the opportunity to engineer and record some other artists as well as working in IT. Now I can make as much music as I like and also have a small income recording other peoples music. I've also written music for video games, commercials, community activities, etc - all from the convenience of my basement. Because of my ambition, I've been able to acquire more equipment and more clients - now this is my full time focus. I am no longer in IT, having made the transition to audio engineer and this spring I will be opening a new facility for my recording business.  Over the course of time, nothing has been more valuable than having the freedom to record when and where I want. At this point, I am thinking of seriously paring down my system to an audio interface like the Universal Audio Apollo Quad paired with an Audient ASP880 8 channel interface via ADAT. This allows me to continue to grow my outboard equipment in the studio while letting me branch out once again into remote or location recording. Taking everything I need in a padded bookbag and 2U rack.  Has it been worth it? Yes.  Right now, the perfect prosumer setup would be something like a MacBookPro/PC Laptop, Focusrite Saffire 18|20 interface, a few Shure SM57s, and a decent hardware mic pre (for vocals) like a Warm Audio WA12 or GAP73mkII. You could go even cheaper but for great recordings on a budget - that would be it for me. The idea being theres always room to grow... ",

            "answer_text": "It depends a great deal on what your use is for it. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll make more money with it than you spend on it. However, there are other reasons to make the investment. I record several concerts every year for two groups. I started doing it because my wife sings in both groups. She wanted to use the recordings for practice. Initially, I tried recording with my phone. If you have a smartphone, I highly recommend trying it. The results I got were horrible. I bought a moderately priced portable recorder. It is a 2-channel Tascam unit that cost under $200. I tried using it with the built-in microphones. The results were superior to what I got with my phone, but not good enough. I bought some decent microphones, cables and a stand. When I say decent, I mean that all of that the mics, cables and stand cost a total of about $60. This wasn\u2019t an expensive proposition. Because I was going to be setting up microphones rather visibly at performances, I asked permission from the director. I assured him that I had no intention of trying to sell them, and explained that they were practice and personal enjoyment. He was happy to let me, but asked for copies. Now a few years later, I\u2019m supplying copies to most of the members of both groups. I\u2019m absolutely certain that the director, my wife and most of the singers in both groups have better ears than I do. They are all very happy with the quality of the recordings. Now, for the cost of my time and effort at the concerts, and either mine of my wife\u2019s afterwards we have recordings of all of their concerts No, this is not an investment with a monetary return for me.
