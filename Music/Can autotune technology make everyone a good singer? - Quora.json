            "answer_text": "Autotune will certainly adjust the pitch of any voice to the nearest semitone, but whether that is the appropriate semitone will depend on the singer being at least able to distinguish one note from another, which I can say from bitter experience is not always the case. So, putting aside all those who can only make a sound like deflating bagpipes, the remainder will have their inaccuracies of pitch corrected. If a lot of correction is going on, it won\u2019t sound natural, because it can only make up for so much lack of talent. Let\u2019s imagine you are a pretty decent singer, member of the choir maybe, and you want to record some favourites. Autotune will save your blushes when it comes to playing back to friends, because it tuned out a few notes that weren\u2019t quite there. Your friends make appropriate noises of approval and encouragement, but don\u2019t actually pester you for a copy. Compare with a good singer. The successful ones don\u2019t just sing in tune, they make sure they are entertaining their audience. Enormous attention is paid to the way a song will be presented, how each phrase will be expressed, the performance nuanced to convey meaning, emotion. Autotune not required. The answer then, is no. Autotune technology cannot make everyone a good singer, in the same way that a spell checker cannot make everyone a good novelist. ",
