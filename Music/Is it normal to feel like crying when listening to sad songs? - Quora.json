            "answer_text": "yes,its perfectly hackneyed to moan while listening to melancholic songs,as they happen to trigger an incident in the past which in some manmer is related to you and you cherish that memory deep down and when you ear to words that just happen to describe that perfect memory of yours in the past,you loose yourself and connect with the music emotionally. So,just flow with your emotions,feel deeply and savour the moment,it may tell you something about yourself which you might have never known. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not normal if you don\u2019t cry. Well, not necessarily. Music\u2019s lyrics and tones pull at strings connected to our life moments. Many aren\u2019t connected, so we don\u2019t react. But some remind us of a specific time, place, person, and sadness. Well feel it, and we cry. Crying can be so cleansing. I always do it alone, because, you know, I worry about how I fall out on the manly scale, but feeling those tears pour out their hot stream feels like a valve has been opened. I recommend listening to a sad song and crying. ",
