            "answer_text": " My 1978 Gibson Les Paul Standard - natural finish. I bought that guitar with money I made helping my father rebuild our porch. It was probably my first \u2018real\u2019 guitar. I bought it from my friends girlfriend who didn\u2019t like it because it was \u2018too heavy\u2019. Not only have I used it for many things since then, in 1986, a band I was working for asked Ace Frehley from Kiss to sit in with them. Ace shows up without a guitar. Not only did I spend a lot of time with him which was blast, but I let him use my guitar for 2 or 3 songs. There is an entire video of YouTube of this event titled \u2018Smashed Gladys at Cat Club Ace Frehley\u2019 - and at the end of the video, Ace takes off the guitar, and hands it to me. I still have those strings in the picture, and a note from Ace that says \u2018Great guitar Chris!\u2019. Ace was probably the guy that got me into guitar playing. Seeing that gatefold to Kiss Alive II, I knew I wanted to play in a band. I\u2019ll never sell that thing :) ",
