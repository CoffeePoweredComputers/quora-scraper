            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not \u201cmore intelligent\u201d, because it is just using musicality concepts in a different way than popular music. Pop music and classical music both use similar concepts, and require similar knowledge to execute them. In fact, a lot of composers these days will gravitate to composing classical music because it is much easier than composing an effective/successful pop song. Classical music is of course much more impressive-sounding, but don\u2019t let that fool you into thinking it takes a brilliant genius to create it. Classical music, when you get down to it, is actually a lot more simple than it looks.  Here, for instance, is a piano sketch. It is not hard to compose something like this, because it is just a rhythm, a harmony, and a melody. But then after applying orchestration techniques to it, you can end up with a big composition like this:  This is actually the same information as in the above piano sketch, only it is now divided and spread out among many instruments. The example is from Rovshan Asgarzade\u2019s YouTube series. It is very illuminating to watch if you are interested; the following video can illustrate how to expand a simple piano sketch into a complete orchestration.  Now look at a typical pop song:  It\u2019s the song \u2018Hello\u2019 by Adele. As you can see, it is basically the same kind of thing. In fact, pop music is harder to compose because it usually uses more interesting, unique rhythms that people demand to hear, or they won\u2019t stay interested. To turn that piano sketch into a pop song is actually a huge amount of work and requires similar skills as an orchestration. Edit: Some helpful, nice Quoran has pointed out how \u201cfuckloads more examples\u201d are needed to prove these claims, and while one can notice the nastiness of this kind of comment, it does mean we can examine more musicality principles and example comparisons. Because yes, it is true that great classical composers are in a different league than a normal pop composer, however a great pop composer is in a similarly great composition league as great composers.  \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d is perhaps a better example of a great modern composition. One can observe how the basic musical, structural elements are similar to another famous, classical score, \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d:  True, many classical composers took a basic idea and then kept building on it until it has achieved something epic, however this is not magic or wizardry; it is a technique and skill, which anyone can learn. It still remains true that many composers of yesteryear had richer musical vocabularies, as far as harmonies and chord progressions, but this only makes classical music (the regular stuff that is) only somewhat more advanced than a lot of today's modern music, and there is not gap of light-years, which some elitists would maintain, often because they are addicted to veneration of older musicians and they lack self-esteem for their own capability. In reality, with just a few basic skills, such as learning how to extend a chord across an entire orchestral range or learning how to give instruments a leading voice (melody), any modern song with sufficient basic motifs could be made into a classical composition.

            "answer_text": "First, you have commingled a lot of different types of music into two broad terms: \u201cclassical\u201d and \u201cpop\u201d, which is short for \u201cpopular\u201d. \u201cClassical\u201d can refer to any of several types of music with varying degrees of complexity. Simple plainchant is not complex at all. All the famous composers wrote what could be considered simple tunes. So to say that classical music (in the broader sense, not limited to that period of the late 1700s to early 1800s) is complex is prejudicial. \u201cPop\u201d music also encompasses several types of music and various levels of complexity. Folk songs fall into this broad category and are usually quite simple. Jazz often is quite complex, especially since a defining characteristic thereof is improvisation. All the songs of Broadway and \u201cTin Pan Alley\u201d also display various levels of complexity. I suspect, however, that by \u201cPop\u201d you are referring to what you currently hear on the radio. Even there, many types of music are represented and many levels of complexity exist. So let us track how things develop. The early Baroque composers produced music that was comparatively simple, Monteverde\u2019s operas for example. 150 years later, when Baroque as a style was beginning to be considered old fashioned, Bach wrote and incredible amount of very complex music, yet still in the same style. A bit later, Mozart\u2019s early works are comparatively simple. But continuing in the classical/romantic tradition (what is generally referred to as \u201cclassical\u201d), we get to the incredible complexity of Wagner, and later Stravinsky and the ilk. Thereafter, we have a reaction to counter all this complexity, with composers such as Glass and Adams writing compositions that are relatively simple. The early rock and roll artists took material from the blues and created \u201cRhythm and Blues\u201d, harmonically simple (3-chord wonders) because the rhythm was the important element. From this grew \u201cRock\u201d, and while there were (and are) always youngsters in their garages plunking away on three chords and dreaming of fame, the genre became more complex in general, culminating the \u201cProgressive Rock\u201d era of bands such as Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Early \u201cRap\u201d was incredibly simple. But as people grew and learned new techniques, current \u201cHip Hop\u201d has examples of incredible complexity as well. So a trend exists in all styles of music starting with simple forms and growing in complexity. Most people find a simple tune such as \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star\u201d (attributed to Mozart) accessible, but understanding the complexity of \u201cHamilton\u201d (which is actually less complex than, say, \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d) is more daunting. Bottom line: people with more exposure, education, training, or sophistication will find more complex works interesting. The simpler forms are always there for everyone else. This is true regardless of the labels we put on types of music. ",
