            "answer_text": "One possible explanation is that you have \u201cawakened\u201d your ears and you are now able to process what you hear much more quickly. This happens to musicians quite frequently. In college I had to take courses in whats known as \u201cear training.\u201d (ear straining is more like it.). Basically in this class the teacher would play various examples and we had to notate them on manuscript paper. It was a 1 hour credit course that was brutally difficult because I couldnt hear crap and everyone else could\u2026so i went to the listening lab, I did all the exercises\u2026but i still couldnt even identify a major chord from a minor one simply by listening. One day, out of the blue, long about the middle of my 2nd semester, I woke up and I heard things differently. All of the sudden this class that had been impossible, became so easy\u2026I finally understood why it was only a 1 hour course. There is some evidence that in musicians, the processing of what they hear can be \u201ctaken over\u201d by the same part of the brain that interprets what we see. In essence you start hearing with your optical processors which work faster than any other part of your brain. It allows for you to perceive and store much more information much more rapidly. So you would hear more in the music today, than you were able to hear yesterday, and it does make things sound different. Suddenly you can hear every variance in pitch, every production flaw\u2026its all right there. ",

            "answer_text": "A song has a lot of elements going on at the same time. Your brain tends to focus on just enough of what it needs from it. So lyrics, melody, the general texture, etc. And then at one point, as you listen to it so much, it just starts to notice some other smaller things it used to not notice as much, and as a result of that it starts sounding different or new, while still being the same. This is why musicians, and mix and mastering engineers in the studio need frequent breaks when working on a record, because when they come back for another listen, things start sounding a whole lot different even if they left it the way it was just five minutes ago!
