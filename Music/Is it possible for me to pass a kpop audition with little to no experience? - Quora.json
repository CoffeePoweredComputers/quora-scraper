            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it is possible but the chance is extremely low. Just take Lisa from Blackpink for example, out of 4000 applicants in Thailand for YG Entertainment audition, she is the only person passed the audition. Prior to the audition, she took dancing lesson since she was 4 years old and competed in many dance contests. She was also a member of a dance crew known as We Zaa Cool. So do you think you are talented enough to pass the audition without any formal training? ",

            "answer_text": "depends on what you mean by experience. if it\u2019s experience on stage performing then passing the audition wouldnt be a problem as long as you have the talent for it, because while being a trainee, they teach you those things. if you mean that you have no experience in singing/dancing/acting then it\u2019s most likely no, but there are examples when idols were accepted into their company only for their visuals like lucas, taehyung or jin. but you have to have very good visuals.
