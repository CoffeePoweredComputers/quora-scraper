            "answer_text": "This is such a great and deep question. Tone seduces readers, conveys a way of looking at things and is at the same time the prism through which everything is viewed. The story is fabricated within the context of a tone. Mastery of this context is essential to long form writing. When managed well, it becomes invisible and supports the reader\u2019s progress - and, managed badly, impedes it. An example of a writer struggling to master tone is Marcel Proust in his first novel, which rather jumps around and is perplexing to read - where by book two the story moves at a much steadier pace, as he seems to settle into his idiom. Arguably the first displays more brilliance, but it\u2019s a bit tiring. A good analogy is with typefaces: sans serif fonts may look cool, but serifs accentuate the letter form and make words faster to recognise. The wide useage of eg. Times New Roman is based on its making typeface a non-issue - you easily see past it to the content. Quora uses a serif font that as not TNR - and this gives it an identity. Tone can do something similar. ",

            "answer_text": "I keep seeing this question!!!! I will answer and hope to never see this question again. This is what tone is:  Style of writing -- like formal or informal writing. Or in other words, the manner in which you say something.\"Hi, how are you today?\" VS. \"Yo! How's it goin'?\" --  \"I saw it! A flicker of light peeked through the window, overcasting on to the stone wall and disappearing as quick as it came. Who would dare to snoop?\"  VS. \"I saw it! A flicker of light peeked through the window, overcasting on to the stone wall and disappearing as quick as it came. Is someone here?\" Which brings me to...  Style of word choice -- How the author puts words together. This goes along with the style of writing. Depending on how you put your words together the formality will change. This includes using dialects instead of \"proper English\" to give off an informal manner. I suggest reading Their Eyes were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston if you are interested in looking at what I mean by using dialect.  POV may affect tone: First person, (very rare) second person, and third person can affect the tone of the story because of the words being chosen to describe something.First person: \"I saw it! A flicker of light peeked through the window, overcasting on to the stone wall and disappearing as quick as it came. Who would dare to snoop?\" Third person: \"Geno lifted his head as a flick of light peeked through the window, overcasting on to the stone wall and disappearing as quick as it came. Who would dare to snoop?\" In first person there is a personal relationship between what Geno does and says. In third person you \"see\" what Geno in a third body experience. So this may affect the purpose of what the author is trying to convey. Purpose of different tones  Convey a certain feeling --For example:  Humor.Sarcasm.Horror.Mysterious.Hatred.Aloof, other words happy.Whimsical, in other words playful. Why convey a certain feeling?I'm sure you're aware of different genres in literature: horror books, children books, fantasy books, satire (funny) books. Usually you want to give off a certain feeling when you write different genres. Would a horror book be as scary if the author used a happy, whimsical tone? No. A horror book will have a different tone than an essay because I'm sure your teacher wants to read a concise \"matter-of-fact\" tone rather than a spooky, dark tone.  POV and conveying feelings:Third person allows for a limitless description of thoughts and actions from a myriad of characters. In contrast, first person focuses on one person's views and thoughts. Even if there is only one character and the author uses third person instead of first person the method conveys a certain feeling. As mentioned before, first person is more personal than third person. However, third person may give more impact than first person because it may provide more tension. I recommend reading Gary Paulsen's Hatchet to read a third person view of a book focused on only one character.   Simply, tone gives purpose to the tension and perspective to what you are reading. To read more about tone read here: http://literarydevices.net/tone/ Function of Tone: Tone, in a piece of literature, decides how they readers read a literary piece and how they should feel while they are reading it. It stimulates the readers to read a piece of literature as a serious, comical, spectacular or distressing. In addition, tone lends shape and life to a piece of literature because it creates a mood. Moreover, tone bestows voice to characters and it throws light on the personalities and dispositions of characters that readers understand better. ",
