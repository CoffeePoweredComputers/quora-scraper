            "answer_text": "A DJ is basically an Individual who plays different songs in the clubs and parties and festivals and unlike a normal pause and play, he mixes different tracks and effects and creates different vibes for the crowd so that the crowd enjoys each and every moment of his play, And if you\u2019re talking about the DJs that are taking over the EDM industry then you should know almost all are DJs and Producer at the same time. So they produce tracks on their select genre and mixes them with melodies and other stuff they like and release their tracks and when you see those people in big festivals like Sunburn, EDC, Tommorowland , then they mix their own songs combined with all other DJs songs. And the definition of a DJ and Producer varies with each Individual DJ and Producer as there are a lot of things involved while making music. ",
