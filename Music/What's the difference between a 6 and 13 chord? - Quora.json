            "answer_text": "There is a bit of confusion here in some of the other answers, which I will try to clear up. The 6th and the 13th are the same note in a chord. Why use one name instead of the other? It is NOT because the 13th is an octave higher than the 6th, because you can voice the different chord members any way you like, in any octave, and the chord name will be the same. This is why: When you indicate \u201c13\u201d in a chord, it implies that the all the lower odd-numbered chord members COULD be present as well, so 1 3 5 7 9 11 and 13. When you indicate \u201c6\u201d in a chord, it also implies all the lower odd-numbered chord members could be present as well, but this list is only 1 3 5 6. Most tellingly, the 7th is missing from this list, and that is the most important note for chord function, along with the 3rd. All the other chord members are just colour and thickness. Because of the nature of chord nomenclature, you assume all chord members are from the major scale of the root of the chord, EXCEPT the 7th, which is assumed to be the minor 7th. So C13 could contain (not \u201cmust contain\u201d, but \u201ccould\u201d) C E G Bb D F A. In practical terms, you would generally include the 3rd and 7th, and then one or two of whatever other chord members you wanted. A lot of musicians would TRY to include the 13th, because it\u2019s there in the chord name, but it is not a rule that it has to be there. There is an unwritten rule in common-practice jazz voicing that you will not have a major 3rd with a perfect 11 (E and F in a C13 chord) occurring in the same voicing. Usually you would choose the 3rd over the 11, but that is not a rule either. So the 11 is most often omitted from a C13. In modern jazz however, that goes out the window. If you specifically alter any chord member, then that of course overrides the default. Any term meaning \u201cmajor\u201d in the chord symbol (M, MA, maj, or a triangle) applies ONLY to the 7th (the 3rd is already major by default, remember!) So Cmaj13 would have a B natural overriding the default B flat. This is in opposition to those answers that said that a 13th will always happen on a dominant 7th type chord. Sometimes the Cmaj13 chord is called Cmaj7 6/9, which contains all the same pitches as Cmaj13, but it\u2019s longer to write out. If you have any term meaning minor in the chord symbol (m, MI, min, or \u2014 ) then that applies ONLY to the 3rd, not to any other chord members. So Cm13 would have C Eb G Bb D F A in it, and there is no problem between Eb and F like there was between E and F, so the 11th can stay. The exception to the default minor 7th rule is diminished 7th chords. On a dim7 chord, the triad is diminished AND the 7th is diminished. Any other chord members should be named according to major scale degrees based on the root of the chord, or altered from the major scale degrees, as is usual. ",

            "answer_text": "The 6 is often called an \u201cadd 6\u201d because, as indicated in the other answer, it\u2019s not the result of the stacking of 3rds *leading up to* the scale degree. Two examples from the Beatles are: In She Loves you, the famous \u201cyeah, yeah yeah\u201d ends on a G6 chord (G B D E). Producer George Martin thought that sounded \u201ccorny\u201d like the Andrews Sisters and suggested they change it, but Lennon McCartney said they liked the sound. In that context, it works, and avoids being reminiscent of that 40\u2019s vibe Martin was referring to. And at the end of Help, when John sings \u201c help me-ee, wooo\u201d the final note he hits is the 6th of the major chord. The 13th, though it\u2019s the same note as the 6th, includes many of the intermediate scale degrees, and in combination with the Dom7th, has a pleasingly dissonant quality which is great for Jazz and R&B. Two examples: Stevie Wonder\u2019s Isn\u2019t She Lovely begins with the minor-9 - Let\u2019s call the home key A for our purposes here. The chord includes a B right next to its half-step neighbor C, resulting in that dissonance. Then there\u2019s the D13th with those notes still next to each other (the 13th and 7th). The root note is D, and the G slides down to the F# for that chord. Boz Scaggs\u2019s Lowdown has an Em9 going to A13th, over the lyrics \u201cI wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, whooo\u2026 (put those ideas in your head)\u201d On the word \u201cwho\u201d the chord changes to the 13th, with the G and F# in different octaves, but still with the dissonant tang that\u2019s so pleasing to the ear. Enough of my long-winded response - the proof of the pudding is in the listening ;) ",
