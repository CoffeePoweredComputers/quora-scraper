            "answer_text": "My honest opinion on kpop this will probably be a long answer so I'm warning you all just ahead of time. Read further of you want, no one is stopping you. Again these are my opinions. I have always thought kpop groups are very stiff and kinda robotic, from the very first time I listened to this point in my life. What I mean by this, is the whole trainee to debut to 5 years into the career. A lot of it comes from training the idols to become funny,witty, look at the camera consistently, literally fake laugh when things aren't funny but \u201cfunny\", always smile, etc. So that there won't be any kind of criticism thats so negative. I feel that this is robotic because groups who just debut you could tell how nervous some of them are (not that being nervous is a bad thing it is natural). But a lot of times in variety they are forced to laugh and smile when there are jokes that are literally not to the point you are laughing out of your chair (some groups do do this). Being trained to look at the camera on live stages is another thing. Like yes it shows you are professional but also its not very interactive with audiences (watching at home or even there) unless its a concert. Its also expected from a group too. Groups or idols who have been in the industry a little longer, get kinda looser on camera. On an episode of Roommate (a reality show), Nana who is a member of After School mentioned that there are so many times when she doesn't feel like smiling or laughing in front of a camera all the time, that she just wants to appear in camera sometimes as how she feels at the moment. So many companies will only want to show the bright side of these groups on camera, never really their serious moments. To be trained to always look happy, look at the camera, always have a bright witty personality, is just very robotic to me. Some groups do truly look like they are having a great time but at the end of the day I feel that its exhausting to keep this persona.I feel like fandoms aren't that great of a thing to have in a group. The first time I started listening to kpop was when I noticed fandoms a lot more. I feel that fandoms just create more of a way to separate themselves from others even though you can both like the music. Its the same with American artists, not just kpop (although they don't put a lot of emphasis on fandoms in America). But really groups/artists with fandoms are really always prone to fandom wars just to always see who has a better fandom or who is a better artist. In America, artists that have fandoms have the most fanwars, like Beyonce's Beyhives, Ariana Grandes's Arianators, etc. I feel like it just makes people feel the need to be part of something. Like I am a V.I.P, and part of several other fandoms but sometimes I just want to just a fan of the group without being in no fandom. Yet I want to socialize with other fans which is why I'm still in the fandom. It just feels like being part of an organization or some guild in video games under a group/solo artist where they have admins, organizers, etc and sometimes these fandoms ask for money to do an event or donate (not that its a bad thing, but still).There is nothing wrong with not going global. Twice is mainly successful in South Korea, and to me if thats what JYP wants is for them to maintain success there then its nothing wrong with that. Although they could have world tours for international fans, but to collaborate or try to enter the western market is not the end of the world for them if they don't do so. They are very successful without these collaborations and western markets. Same with other groups who are mainly popular in South Korea. If kpop idols want to push themselves out there then they could try doing things like Tiffany from SNSD (Not that this is the only and best way its just an example). Although its harder to promote as a group but if its something an idol really wants then they can definitely try. Also a lot of collaborations depend on the other party, there are probably lots of western artists who want to collab with many different kpop idols that is being talked about in closed doors. But a lot of times both parties are just extremely busy to do so, especially if they are from two different countries. Lots of kpop companies may just not have that desire or picture for them to promote outside of Asia at the moment, and if the majority of the group is okay with that then its okay with what those groups are doing right now.Sometimes groups have too many comebacks, activities, and promotions in one year and idols are just overworked due to it. Lets take BTS promoting in 2016 for example. That year really was the year for BTS as they started to emerge into the western market. However, that year and 2017 were just piled with comebacks, promoting in the western market, world tour, etc. Not to mention their other world tour the follow year. I honestly felt bad for them having to promote that much because even if we weren't hearing from them at the times they were not promoting, good chance they were practicing for a next comeback. Same with NCT, 2018 was their year, where from the very beginning of the year to the end they were having so many comebacks with their units. (Mark must feel tired throughout that whole year). And also appearing in the western market too with promoting on American shows. From last year to this year. They are probably practicing with another comeback with another unit soon. Even after Dream's latest comeback, good chance we will see another unit promotion soon. Its barely August and NCT already had a world tour, comeback while touring, and now NCT dream cameback. Its good to have units but still. It just seems that bigger groups do not get much of a break, even if the company says they are, they are probably practicing as I type this. I feel that a true break is not really hearing from a group in like 6months or 8months. Some fans of other groups want their group to comeback more, and I feel that its time,money, and rest is a lot more important than a demand of a comeback. (Although f(x) should be making a comeback soon, SM has hid them quite a while). Edit: Bighit announced that BTS will be on a long break. This better stay true.A lot of kpop of kpop idols really worry about their image a little too much. Im not talking about their insecurities, but how they feel about other things. A lot of times fans in fandoms can be in the wrong, and really can be out of control and out of hand. Some things that fans say and do are just unacceptable. Yet no one who is within that fandom steps out and tells their fellow fans that is something wrong. Kpop idols themselves barely, and I mean barely even talk back to their fans. Even if what they are reading and seeing things that hurts them too. Since they and their company are worried about fans leaving and honestly that is not even the worry here. Its really idols and companies are just gonna let their own fandoms get out of hand and wait until the problem dies down. People get physically and mentally hurt in their fandoms sometimes, and idols and companies should be responsible for keeping them in good balance. Fan behavior can get so out of hand, I've seen videos where fans get trampled by their own fandom in the airport, sasaengs doing what they always do, extreme death threats (like the RM and that \u201cfan\u201d who threatened to shoot RM at a concert), and more. Yet them or their company just doesn't even say or do a single thing but the bare minimum of probably suing for malicious comments or just call out sasaengs and tell them to stop. Its not aggressive enough to stop these actions from going on honestly. Not that this will help but it can reduce the actions of others where they will see that if their idol calls them out they will be put on the spot for their wrong doing.Kpop dances don't have to be complex all the time. BoA pointed out how their company is always having them do flashy, complex, sweaty, choreography. And she mentioned that it doesn't always need to be this way and I completely agree. Not every single song a kpop group doesn't need to have this hard choreography. Sometimes its fun just to leisurely dance along to songs because its easy. Its easy to do flash mobs to, and easy to learn for those who want to learn choreographies of kpop songs and are beginners. Harder choreographies are also nice to, to admire and think its cool but its also exhausting if every or the majority of songs in the discography are like this. Although its nice to learn too. But I see so many just talking about girl group choreographies and saying its too easy or too simple. While boy groups almost always have to have the hard choreographies, or choreographies that are made by Riehata (big Japanese choreographer), and other big choreographers.Kpop companies most likely have the dating ban due to the history of having obsessive fans. They do this to protect the image and mentality of the idol when they first debut. So that they won't have any problems with fans regarding relationships in a group. (Jpop is this way too, although a lot of times that ban doesn't get lifted until they leave the whole group.) Fans who don't understand that idols should date can complain all they want but this is like this to protect them the best they can. Its on the fans side to really try and understand that idols can be in loving relationships too.I probably have more to say, but I gotta do my job and analyze my data. Will add more later if I think of an opinon. ",

            "answer_text": "DISCLAIMER- A really long answer ahead but don't worry I have highlighted the points in bold for your lazy asses. If u r okay read the pointers if u r not okay then please read the full point. I will also discuss some sensitive topics in the end so stay tuned. this answer is coming from an army, blink and igot7. I do not mean to hate on any group. I love all groups. Sexualizing idols is OKAY. Okay I know a lot of you will come at me. Please read the full point. It is okay to some extent, but not okay with minors. Like Tyuzu was sexualized, it was not okay. But if some idols wish to wear short clothes, it is okay. U may be wondering who would ask for short clothes themselves? Yes, there are idols who demands shorter clothes from their stylists to make their legs appear longer in their rookie days. Double standards exists in kpop. periodt.Visuals are very important in the group and it doesn't means that other members are not beautiful/handsome/attractive. They are needed for appealing to public not only in South Korea but also internationally and globally.  All idols are overworked by there companies. The only exception I will allow are BlackPink, well YGE loves to make their idols relax. Idols need break, and half the time the company reduces their break.Plastic surgery is not at all bad. Well, idols don't get plastic surgery like Kim Kardashian. There is no problem in admitting it. Fans should stop protecting idols if someone says they got a plastic surgery.Some Quorans put shit questions to start fan wars among people like-who is better BTS or BlackPink?who is better BTS or EXO?who is better BTS or Twice?who is better BTS or NCT?who is better BTS or 1 Direction?who is better BTS or Stray Kids?who is better EXO or Stray Kids?who is better NCT or Stray Kids?who is better BlackPink or Twice?which visuals do you hate?which vocals do you hate?Let idols date. This point is more for delusional fans who think that they will marry their oppas and unnies. Please if some Hollywood actor or actress dates it is a hot news, people support them so why not with kpop idols? They are humans and they deserve to live a normal life. Chill guys they are just dating, they have not murdered anyone!Girl groups have easier dances as compared to boy groups. The reason for this is that the companies will give then short and tight clothes in which they have to dance. They can not do high jumps so rarely a girl group has a dance with a lot of body movements. Whitewashing idols pictures is not very bad unless we just see white light on their face. I agree their tanned faces are really like by fans but companies try their best to make idols full fill the Korean beauty standards as far as possible. Blue hair idols have to come back. I mean every single idol has rocked blue color like hell. Picture attached for you people to admire. Visuals of a group aren't untalented. They have practiced day and night to accomplish and become what they are, they deserve to be equally treated. Companies create the position of visuals in their groups to draw attention, but most of the time the visuals are the only one who get less screen time and lines. I mean what is the point of appointing visuals if they are seen for so less in the music videos. Not all idols are bisexual/gay/lesbian. Okay so people [mostly non kpop fans] say that applying makeup means you are bisexual/gay/lesbian. Okay so let's see.. so more than half of Korean population uses makeup and all idols use makeup. So you are telling me more than half of Korea is Bi. Fuck I didn't knew that shit. Well, shut up your mouth if nothing good can come out of it.There is nothing wrong with being privileged. The idols from big3 and others as well [TXT] are privileged but, they have worked hard and trained for long to debut and a lot of people have spilled tea about the life schedule of a trainee.  Shipping idols together is not good, male and female idols should not be shipped, they r pure shit, don't assume unless an idols confirms the rumors. Just imagine your picture with some stranger you don't even know. How awkward will it be? Dynamite was OKAY. It was not as good as other singles by BTS but the thirteen remixes released by BigHit were good. I can't listen to that song on repeat. And like many others that song wasn't stuck in my mind. ON could have surpassed dynamite easily but BigHit did not have any promotions for it. They widely promoted dynamite. ON was way way way better than dynamite and deep down you know it. BTS has the best rap line in kpop industry till now. fight me. BTS' vocal line is okay but not as bad as people have made it. I agree that Jin was a visual but listen to his voice it has improved so much, he sings songs so effortlessly pulling off high notes, Jimin was positioned as a dancer, his voice is good but sometimes his voice sounds unstable (?) in live concerts, V auditioned as a rapper but then he was placed as a vocal but no doubt he has a really unique voice. Only Jungkook was originally from the vocal line and has heavenly vocals obviously. BigHit is using BTS purely for money, they had such wide range for merchandise for a damn concert. They are selling all kinds of materials like key chains, water bottles, bags, stuffed toys, clothes, shoes. BTS are already brand ambassadors of Samsung. They are literally on Coca Cola, Samsung LG, Puma, Hyundai, Lotte, VT cosmetics, have 2 toy lines, are in partnership with LINE aka Korea\u2019s biggest toy line, Nike, Adidas, Chilsung, Baskin Robins, New Era, BodyFriend, ChupaChups, Starbucks, formula E, LeSportStac, Casetify, Sketchers, Lemona, Fila, Tokopedia, did a FRIED CHICKEN COMMERCIAL ( it is a big deal in Korea), KwangJuYu, Mattel and more. Like wtf BigHit chill down, BigHit thinks that if it is BTS they will make money out of it without any effort.Armys are not overprotective at any times but they act childishly sometimes. On the other hand there are armys who are mature and accept BTS for who they are. The army aren\u2019t overprotective. They have been with BTS since long and don\u2019t want the boys to face any problems, it breaks their hearts.Jin was insecure of his looks. So, here comes a really controversial topic. I felt like he was insecure of his looks and called himself world wide handsome to cover it up. He really is handsome and now has accepted the fact. I maybe wrong here.Dynamite was probably made for topping the billboard charts. It is neither the boys fault nor BigHit's. The cause of this problem is purely billboard itself. They do not give a lot of air time to songs having Korean lyrics. Dynamite was made in English to accomplish this only. Savage love remix was also very good. I wished V, Jimin, Jin, RM were a part of the song. If BigHit is giving such opportunities to Jungkook, Suga, J-hope, they should also plan other solo activities for other members especially V and Jin. which takes us to the next point.J-Hope is also all rounded along with Jungkook. This man cold do anything, literally. He is the dancer of the group, he can rap so well and he can also do great vocals. He is sooooo handsome that anyone can fall for him. You have to accept the fact that Taehyung and Jin are mistreated. Okay so I understand that a song doesn't fit all members and most lines are given to person or member who fits the song the best, but it is not like they do not match with any group concept usually they are the one who are given less lines. Now for screen time--- come on BigHit they are the major visuals of the group. Fans want to see them a lot too in the videos. Similarly, accept the fact that Jungkook is favored and it is not Jungkook's fault. It is purely the companies fault here. I think sometimes Suga and RM overshadow J-Hope as a rapper. why do I thinks so? Because Suga and RM's raps are more deep and dark and have a lot of swear words. On the other hand J- Hope has very bright cheerful raps so sometimes it feels as if J- Hope is being overshadowed. I love J-Hopes raps though.BTS having western collabs is not bad. I think they should do more. Reason- they are not going to leave Korea at all, they love their country, culture and they will and should not be considered as an outcast if they collab with western artists.People say that boy with luv was not good, I disagree. I could listen to the song on repeat the whole day. It was a cultural reset, and the choreography was on a whole another level. MVs for some old BTS songs- No more dream, we are bulletproof pt.2, N.O., boy in luv- were really bad, the styling was horrible as hell, I mean Suga is the rapper of the group, dress him decently and same goes for other members. Suga specially stands out as he looks so cute and I can bet half of people wont believe Suga is a rapper if they see him dressed up like that. Sets were horrible, like only the song and choreography was good rest everything was really bad.Half blonde and half pink can only and only be pulled of by TaeTae. fight me. Crediting BTS for some achievement doesn't means that we are disrespecting other groups. For all those bitches who feel like that please it is called <<praising>> not <<disrespecting.>>BTS deserves a Grammy and I will leave it here.BTS and Halsey aren't very good as they appear on camera. I heard there were rumors that some members wee reluctant to collab with Halsey. I maybe wrong here.BigHit is not a very good company I guess the above points have made it clear.I am really expecting a lot from BE album and a lot of solos and subunits, BigHit said it is the most relative album to BTS' style. I have odd and weird vibes when I see Oli London. I mean every human loves Jimin but lol dude you do not look like Jimin at all. More like trash.The really memorable western collab was Steve Aoki mic drop remix. Rest were good but it was superior. Vlives, run BTS and other Bangtan Bombs should not be scripted, run BTS has become boring, seeing grown men run around like 5 year olds is just weird.Stop imagining that your faves can achieve what BTS did. No group can if you want to think like that I would not disturb you, keep dreaming but it the reality.BTS Collabs that will leave the music industry shook are-BTS x Taylor SwiftBTS x Billie EilishBTS x Ariana GrandeBTS x Selena GomezBTS x LizzoBTS x Any member of 1-DirectionBTS x Jonas BrothersBTS x Post MaloneBTS x Cardi BBTS x Beyonc\u00e9Mint hair Yoongi has to come back. It left the fans shook. He looks so handsome with those hair! BigHit needs to debut a girl group. They have to come out of the GLAM scandal and have female trainees who will be debuting. G Friend is not originally under BigHit but they need to have an original girl group. Where BTS is now is not their peak. They have to win Grammys and do a lot of collabs and I am sure that they will continue to do so.The influence of K-pop will lessen in the west after BTS disbands but will not be entirely removed. Many people will stop stanning groups but k-pop will remain there.This year was a great comeback for BlackPink. If they continue to give at least one album an year, they might not disband and maybe blinks will be more supportive.BlackPink's talent is underutilized by YGE. The girls have a lot of potential. I am very sure the girls would have achieved a lot if they came from any other company. YGE is literally wasting their talent. It cannot save everything for the end.Blinks are not toxic and are really good. For those who say blinks are toxic, they are called Blonks and refer to themselves as blinks. Kindly inform those they aren't Blinks and remind them they do not belong with Blinks. Only and only Blonks and solo stans are toxic.All BlackPink songs do not have bad lyrics. Periodt.Lisa's dance seems different at different times. Sometimes she just rocks the concept like hell, sometimes her body seems stiff, it doesn't make her a bad dancer.Bet You Wanna ft. Cardi B was not as good as expected. Having Cardi B on your featuring list, the song is expected to be really good, the only thing I think was iconic was Cardi B's rap. BlackPink \"The Album\" had all the good songs except for Ice Cream. the lyrics were very annoying. Overall the song was quiet pleasant.BlackPink isn't, wasn't, and will never be a better version of 2NE1. They are unique in their own way. No group can ever replace 2NE1. Jisoo's vocals> Rose's vocals. Jisoo's deep voice really hits hard. There are a lot of female idols who have good voice but Jisoo's voice is simply unique.Jennie's rap> Lisa's rap. I have seen a lot of people prefer Lisa as a rapper, but I think Jennie will be better as a rapper and Lisa will be good as a vocalist. Lisa's rapping skills are not bad.Jennie is not lazy. Periodt.It seems as if YGE was planning BlackPink's album and Netflix documentary since long, they released it a bit late. They released it around the time when a lot of Blinks had left the fandom thinking YGE won't provide a lot of content.TXT should first establish themselves in South Korea and then move on to being westernized. They need to have a strong fan base in SK.TXT WAS privileged but is no more, people referred to them as BTS' brother group but now they have enough recognition and people know them as TXT and not as BTS' brother group.All stray kids music is not noise [ I am not a stay, hence, I am not biased] Not shy was cringe. BUT, ITZY's music will improve in 2-3 years.JYP is also wasting talent by not giving comebacks to it's boy groups. Got7 is so talented but they rarely have a comeback. JYPE focuses more on their girl groups. Got7 will disband once their contract ends. JYP is creepy. I know he looks young for his age but he is not that attractive and very weird. When he did the aegyo at Weekly Idols that creeped me out sooooo much.Jessi is the most realistic idol. She speaks herself. she is original- not a persona created by the company. She does what she wants to. She swears openly [a lot of groups do]. She openly admits that she has had a lot of plastic surgery. Dahyun doesn't gives weird vibes to me. I have seen a lot of answers saying Dahyun gives weird vibes. It is just that she acts funny and girl groups are expected to be cute.Love shot> Tempo> Obsession [not an EXO-L] this is purely my opinion.G friend and Seventeen have grown a lot under BigHit. They have become more famous.Ateez is no longer underrated. People seem to think they are under rated but the reality is not that. They are famous enough and most people know Ateez.Ateez deserved Rookie Of The Year. Heesung from Enhypen is handsome but I prefer Sunghoon over him. People say he is very handsome, but I think not...K should have been selected. I feel that the member who has trained for short should train more and the one who has trained a lot and has experienced a lot should debut. Jake could have stayed back.Taki used to give me weird vibes but, he was really talented.I just don't like Niki. He pretended to be so good to Taki and then just voted for him to be eliminated. He is more concerned about himself than others. He feels that his position should be safe rest he doesn't care about. Maybe he will change. IDK.Jay is a very hilarious member, and will be clowning a lot of his fans. Mamamoo is not underrated. They are famous enough and of course talented queens.Mamamoo has one of the best vocals in kpop. Moonbyul's rap is really good and it eats me up. I just get bad vibes from Loco x Hwasa collabs. I don't like it a lot. I don't even like the Loco x Hwasa ship. IDKY.. Hwasa is and will forever remain the queen and one who challenged the beauty standards and become a standard in herself. Now some sensitive topics. please read the whole opinion\u2026. Ideal types by male and female idols are not real. The company tells them to say all those things that match their own personality, this tricks fans in believing that they posses those qualities and keeps them interested in the groups. It is just another marketing strategies. Don\u2019t believe what the YouTube videos say nor what your idol says. Sorry to wake you up to this harsh reality, but it is what it is. BTS military enlistment. Now, I know I shouldn\u2019t comment on this because I am not a Korean citizen and nor do I live there. This is purely my opinion. I think that the government has released the article saying BTS will not be granted exemption just for now so that they do not face any criticism from the Korean population. I think that they will be granted exemption because why not! They have given so much to the Korean economy. All groups whether kpop or pop are unique in their own way. I don\u2019t now why people are comparing groups with each other when there are different bases. People comparing BTS and 1-Direction. Why? They were active at different times. They have so much culture difference, they have significant age gaps, they were active in different places [initially]. The worst part is people are actually answering these questions. Why do we have to answer these questions? The people are here just to start fan wars. Who paved the way? No doubt, that a single person didn\u2019t paved the way of kpop into western countries. Everyone has a variable contribution. Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style became very famous. Many 2nd generation groups helped it out as well, and BTS opened doors further. All have contributed equally. BlackPink is also very famous internationally. So, the point is that not a single person paved the way of kpop. thank you for reading till the end please upvote my answer! ~~PEEHU\u2764\ufe0f EDIT- Thank you Vasuhi Ganeaan for the first upvote on my answer!
