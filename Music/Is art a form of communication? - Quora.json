            "answer_text": "Yes, art is a form of communication.  What separates it from other forms of communication is that the information comes from a subjective source, and is then interpreted in a subjective way by the viewer (or listener, or reader, or whatever form of art you're talking about).  What differentiates a painting of someone from a snapshot of them is that the snapshot is only trying to convey the objective information of what it captures.  A piece of art on the other hand can include all manner of subjective information, either formally through manipulation of color, light, composition and what have you, or conceptually through juxtaposition, reference, abstraction or other forms of visual manipulation.   You can even choose to use a snapshot artistically if you know how to infuse it with subjective meaning, but take that away and it is just an ordinary snapshot again.   The same goes for the difference between a written passage such as this, which is an objective series of words, and a piece of literature or a poem which can use all manner of methods to add additional meaning to the words, that while still only words serve to enlighten in an entirely new and wholy subjective way.  The only problem that you run into sometimes is when the reader (or viewer, or listener, or what have you) interprets things in a different way than was originally intended.  Other times the intended meaning (if there is one) is so vague that people will not immediately know what they're supposed to get from it, leading them to think that those who claim to \"get\" the meaning are simply imagining something or making it up.  But no form of communication is entirely efficient, and the subjective nature of art is the very thing that gives it its meaning and importance to us. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course :) Art is both - the process and the product of some action, mostly related to expression of self.Art comes in various forms and shapes and sizes: from visual arts to performing arts (where actors are trying to tell a story using the movement of their bodies) to literature and other media (such as interactive art). I personally would include even science into the art category: given a proper level of passion for science and an elevated sense of studies (correlation and interaction of parts of the whole), it can become indistinguishable from magic. This would make the art an expression of one's self and will convey a message to others - no knowledge of the author's language, methods or peculiarities of culture: it's all-inclusive, all-accepting, and all-encompassing, with an option for a personal interpretation of the said message.An 80-year old accomplished artist can communicate with both - an infant and a peer - using just the art, and both channels will yield a response, an emotional response from each of those people. My own preference of the communication is music - it seems that each time the words fail me, the music has just the right message to convey, even if it's just the melody without the lyrics. ",
