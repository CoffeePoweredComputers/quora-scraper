            "answer_text": "Definitely \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d. That is one sad song! She does a great job at capturing a particular type of giving up, that comes with a mixture of acceptance, depression and genuinely being at a loss as to, not just what to do, but what the right way is to \u2014be\u2014. It\u2019s about giving up, not because you\u2019re angry, hurt, or frustrated, but because you\u2019ve moved beyond strong feelings, and just accept that you really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing in this whole life thing. All you can do is to keep going, yet, you feel lost, weary and somewhat depressed. You\u2019re weary from trying over and over again, from different angles, with different approaches, to accomplish something, or to figure out a relationship, or to feel that you\u2019re moving forward in life. She does a fantastic job at portraying this point in life, that probably all people face some time or another. It\u2019s a very powerful song. The lyrics specifically talk about being at a loss with life\u2019s problems (clouds), with love (relationships of all sorts), with one\u2019s career, and just with life in general. Music is a force, and this song is so sad, that I have to be careful about when I listen to it. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cThe Circle Game\u201d brings a tear to my eye, but in a good way. The song, written by Joni Mitchell and James Taylor, tells the story of a child's journey to adulthood. The uses a carousel as a metaphor for the years that go by, pointing out how we can look back, but we can't return to our past. The song opens with the young boy enjoying the wonder of youth, but looking forward to getting older. In the second verse, he is 16 and driving. The final verse finds him at 20, with his dreams tempered a bit, but still with high hopes for his future. I tear up because it\u2019s a very nostalgic song for me, bringing me back to the days of youth. I first heard the song during summer camp, and it always brings me back there. It also makes me think of my own children growing up. Beautiful song.  ",
