            "answer_text": "This is not a rap thing, it\u2019s much the same thing as releasing a big Hollywood movie. If you release in an off time, you don\u2019t have much competition, and it will be easy to become #1. If you release at the big volume times, like Christmas, you will be competing against the really big blockbusters, but you will make a lot more volume in sales. It\u2019s not an artistic decision, but one made by the producers and bean-counters. ",
