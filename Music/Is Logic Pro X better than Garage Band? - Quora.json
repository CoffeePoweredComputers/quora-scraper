            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re a beginner, GarageBand is a better choice. It has the same basic logic and appearance of Logic Pro X but far fewer controls. Because of this, you can learn concepts and techniques. You can focus on you music as you master the program. Eventually, you may want some of the features that Logic Pro offers so you will have a reasonably painless upgrade. Logic Pro X is incredibly deep. If you are a professional composer, producer or engineer, you want Logic Pro (which is one of the greatest bargains around).But it can literally take more than a year of work to master it. Charlie ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is if you want more features, sounds and editing and mixing capabilities. Logic Pro X is like GarageBand on steroids. GarageBand is basically a heavily simplified version of Logic Pro X. They look similar and Logic can open GarageBand sessions. GarageBand is designed to introduce beginners to recording, and then lead them toward using Logic Pro X as their skills develop. GarageBand is a good way to start and then move to the more advanced features of Logic Pro X. That\u2019s exactly what I did when I started. ",
