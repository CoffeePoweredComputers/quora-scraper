I have seen many concerts of the two groups (not in rl) and that's my opinion. I'm not an sing coach or something, so I dont know much about this topic, but I know what sounds good and how difficult the notes are that Bts just easily pulls of, like it was nothing. For me it's a fact. Have a wonderful day ",

            "answer_text": "Don't hate me on this but BTS has better vocals. They have Jimin to do high notes and V with them deeper than the ocean vocals. Jungkook and Jin can do both. Jimin can also go low if he wants to and V can go high as well. Also the rappers can sing!! RM and J-Hope can sing. Suga I am sure can sing as well but he jokes about his singing a lot. Blackpink one the other hand have pretty vocals I love their vocals but the vocals of the group have the same vocal range in my opinion. While Jisoo can go a bit lower and Rose can go higher. Jennie and Lisa can also sing. I love Lisa's voice tbh. Jennie has a limited vocal range. I bet she could go higher though. In the end I think BTS has the best vocals. They are both good though. ",
