            "answer_text": "This is what I like about Punjabi music industry. Here, I am talking about Indian, Pakistani and overseas Punjabi music industry altogether. There is hardy any song (not any which is a bit popular) which is copied from any other language as far as lyrics are concerned. Yes, there are many where music is copied, specially these beats songs releasing now a days. This is what makes it my favorite music industry over Bollywood music. Punjabi songs are not copied from any other industry.There are many songs where lyrics are extracted from old poetry by legendary Punjabi poets like Bulle Shah, Ghulaam Fareed etc. There are many songs which are inspired or influenced from old Punjabi songs of legendary singers. For example, there was a song by Babbu Maan titles \u201cMitti\u201d. This was a moderately successful song but it inspired many Punjabi songs on genre of comparison between a cities girl and village boy(Pendu) like Bappu Zimidar etc. But that is not copying and not from any other industry. Here, singers get credit, recognition and good share of money for a song unlike Bollywood where most of the credit, recognition goes to some good looking asshole. \u201cHave you listened Salman\u2019s new song?\u201d Me- \u201c When did he start singing stupid?\u201d It must be Arijit, Atif, Rahat but not him. That is why independent musicians or bands could never survived in there. Punjabi and English music industry are much better in this aspect for the same of artists and audience as well. Lyricists put their name signature in most of the songs and get good fame too.Many famous singer write their songs themselves and that is exactly what we call A Rockstar. It give audience a feel that this song belong to him only and an idea about his thinking as well. All these qualities makes it a good industry which is inspired from within and those who are self inspired, inspire others. That is why you can see its now ruling Bollywood as well and I love Punjabi songs. \u201cMauzan Lutto\u201d (Have fun) and thanks for A2A. AK ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there are a lot of songs in punjabi which are copied from English songs . There are a number of songs that are released everyday and this gives a huge possibility of adapting already a hit and catchy tune. Most of the punjabi songs are not a copy but due to the influence of the west and pop culture there are a few of them. i am going to mention the some i remeber. majaajne by JSL Singh is copied from the song fabolous by she wildin.Teri bhabhi hai by ninja is copied from Confident by Justin Beiber.Kali behke by micky singh is copied from heart attack by trey songz.Patt laingey by gippy garewal is copied from no games by rick ross.Jordan by akay copied from music of dr dre.changa mada time by akay copied from music of dr dre.Fazilpuria too many girls is copied from i need your love.Copying video concepts have been more relevant now a days. I will update the list with a vivid research. Most of the artists like raftaat mention in credits for the beat used in the rap that is actually a fair play . Some singers take the easy way or maybe they like the tune and rythm so much that they sing in that. I am not a singer i am not judging them but the list given is true as per my knowledge . source- wave punjabi youtube channel. ",
