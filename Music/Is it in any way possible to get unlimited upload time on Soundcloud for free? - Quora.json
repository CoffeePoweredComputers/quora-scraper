            "answer_text": "No. You have to buy a higher premium if you'd like to upload more, otherwise, you have to create a new account. It\u2019s really not that expensive to buy more upload time, so I'd encourage you to do that. You say you have no money, but that just implies you're a) underage w/o a job; or b) of age and don't have a job or good AMT of income; or c) just don't want to spend the money on SoundCloud \u2014 which is dumb. If you can't pony up the measly amount of money for a service that provides a great free service, and you're apt to complain about it, then I encourage you not to use it at all. ",
