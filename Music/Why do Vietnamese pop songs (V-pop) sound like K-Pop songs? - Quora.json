            "answer_text": "There are various reasons. First, there is a segment of Vietnamese population who developed a taste for K-Pop - especially among youth (Vietnamese Americans included.) Enterprising artists, some of whom are also fans of K-Pop, serve this demand by composing songs in K-Pop style, just like earlier generations catered to the Canto-Pop or J-Pop fan bases. The influence can also be artistic experiment. Some musicians only dabble with the K-Pop sound as experiments for certain songs, in search of inspiration. Enough of them doing so at the same time can make people feel that the music scene is awash with K-Pop sound. In recent years a number of Vietnamese musicians and singers also collaborated with their Korean counterparts. Some, like the singer My Tam, produced some of their albums in South Korea including songs in both languages, in the hope of expanding their fan bases. Because of that culture exchange, some K-Pop influence is inevitable. ",

            "answer_text": "As I think, only a few Vietnamese singers are influenced by Korean style, they create songs that resonate with Korean music to attract young people today, because many people feel Korean music is well suited to many people's musical hobbies, which is an easy way to attract attention. However, there are quite a few famous singers in Vietnam who have a particular musical style, they do not follow any standards, and you can easily recognize their songs if you listen to them many times. Such as My Tam, Ha Anh Tuan, ... their music often has deep and strange tone that you hardly encounter in any Korean song. ",
