            "answer_text": "That's a loaded question but I'll try to snswer it. The predecessor to rap is a style of music that was predominately invented by slaves and ex slaves that we label as \"The Blues\". The \"blues\" is how many black men chose to vent or expose their emotions of suppression and being down trodden. Now... we all have different talents as human beings AND,we all have different talents by race. Most hockey players are white because we very rarely have hockey rinks in \"colored\" neighborhood's and whites come from cold temps while subsaharan blacks come from hot temps. When I say \"colored neighborhood's\" I mean people of color like Mexican Arab Black etc... Just like most GOLD winners in the Olympics for marathon running is black peoples from subsaharan Africa. This is because for thousands of years African peoples have been running long distances for resources snd communication, therefore it's not only in their DNA but also physically passed down. Nature/Nurture! The forefathers of American blacks back in the Mother Land of Africa have been singing, chanting, wailing, and dancing for hundreds of millennium so its passed down from generation to generation (what we call \"entertainers\" today) Therefore most of the greatest talented entertainers are black (not all but most). Now this leads up to the question of rap being dominated by blacks. During slavery there were many whites having sexual intercourse with their black slave's. Many American whites have black genes in them from the mixing of races for almost 600 years so we've probably had a black POTUS way before Obama. That will explain white rappers. We were taught that we get our alphabet and math system from Arabs but many people don't know that the Arabs got it from India Indians! So the question could be why are Indians so intelligent (Asians as a whole)? Did aliens truly control our DNA and species? Whites are probably the last race to be created on Earth but why is white America (Europeans) leaders of industry and leaders of the MODERN world? These questions are far more complicated than one human could possibly answer. Indians are beautiful talented entertainers. Bollywood has showed us that. We have to THEREFORE ask ourselves why are there no Indian rappers? American blacks starting from a young age hear rap constantly from their (far too) young parents but why do they excel as \"professional\" rappers? This is one of those questions that can only be answered by many \"educated\" answers then the information can be conglomerate(d) and only then can a hypotheses be made/answered. Many many years of (racial) history and traits will have to be examined for the closest correct answer be given. Studying Sub Saharan rituals and life styles are the answer to that question. ",

            "answer_text": "First, despite the question mark at the end, your sentence is really a statement. Anyway... Hip Hop (like Jazz and Blues before it) began as an African American form. Its roots come from African American and Caribbean culture (Jamacian toasting, playing the dozens, the spoken word poetry of artists like Gil Scott Heron, the music of James Brown and George Clinton, etc.) \"Rap\" itself was an African American slang term for talking (\"Sit down and rap awhile, man\"). Because of his habit of including extended spoken \"sermons\" in his songs (such as \"Hold What You Got\"), '60s soul singer Joe Tex was known as \"The Rapper\". It's therefore only natural that many of the most prominent hip hop artists are black (as is also the case with jazz, blues, and R&B). But, of course, race/color has nothing to do with talent or ability. Just as there have always been great white jazz musicians (going all the way back to Bix Biederbecke), there are also plenty of exceptional rappers of all ethnic backgrounds (Eminem and the Beastie Boys, to name but two).
