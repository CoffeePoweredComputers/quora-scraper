            "answer_text": "Yes! He is a victim of our society. He is a victim of being told to \"man up\" his entire life just like most other American men, who are ridiculed for showing emotion, pain, and sensitivity, but praised for being dominant, strong, assertive, and masculine. Gender stereotyping starts at birth.. before birth, even, and people don't really consider the effects that it has on society. Why are little boys ridiculed for wearing pink, dancing, or playing with babies? This is teaching children that being a girl is a bad thing, and acting like one is even worse. We are teaching men that they are better than women and, to an extent, have the right to treat women as though they are simply an accessory to men. Worse, women grow up thinking that it's just the way things are, placing their value in their sex appeal and outer appearances, and letting men use them at their own disposal. Rhianna and Chris Brown are both victims of the media produced by society. Chris Brown, just like any other man, has grown up hiding his emotions. One can only repress their sadness, jealousy, and frustrations for so long until they erupt. If he had grown up being praised for expressing his feelings, then maybe Chris could have been able to communicate more effectively instead of turning to violence. Instead of shaming our boys for being human, we should support them and teach them to communicate. Violence is never the answer, love is.  ",
