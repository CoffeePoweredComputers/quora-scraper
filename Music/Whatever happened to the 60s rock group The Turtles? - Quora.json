            "answer_text": "The original Turtles split up in 1970 and the two front men, Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, joined Frank Zappa\u2019s band the Mothers of Invention. For contractual reasons Frank Zappa credited Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan as Flo and Eddie. Flo and Eddie fronted the Mothers of Invention for about 18 months and their work was featured on two Mothers albums \u201cLive at the Filmore East\u201d and \u201cJust another band from LA\u201d. Flo and Eddie\u2019s tenure with Zappa came to an end when Frank Zappa was pushed off the stage at London\u2019s Rainbow Theatre in December 1971, and that version of the Mothers was broken up. This year (July 2020) Zappa Records have released a 50th Anniversary four CD box set of the Mothers of Invention featuring Flo and Eddie. Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan appeared in Frank Zappa\u2019s movie \u201c200 Motels\u201d. I saw that version of the Mothers of Invention at Liverpool\u2019s Mountford Hall in December 1971. Music is the Best. ",
