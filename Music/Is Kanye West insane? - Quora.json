            "answer_text": "Kanye West says a lot of things that are shocking. It sounds a certain way when you don\u2019t explain. Much of the tidbits that he gives is done without giving an explanation. That doesn\u2019t make him insane. It is true that Harriet Tubman was freeing people but it is also true that a lot of those people winded u working for white people. So technically Kanye was correct, when you do the research. He also said slavery was a choice. One thing that historians have overlooked is that many people under economic pressure signed up for indentured servitude. This does not mean that nobody was captured against their will. This means that aside from that many people agreed to indentured servitude, meaning they had to work for free for X number of years. The courts confirm this. This is not to confuse people to make them think there was no economic oppression or loan sharking. Nor does it mean that the powers that be did not use questionable practices like not loaning to black businesses and so on. Jim Crow was real just as well. But Kanye was right about it being a choice. What he didn\u2019t say was \u201cin some cases.\u201d just like he didn\u2019t explain the Harriet thing. Also it was not outragous for him to wear a make america great again or to love on Trump. He is one of the few blacks who see the value of Trump, just as Aretha Franklin saw it. They know that it was the democratic party who pushed slavery. They know many things about the democratic party that is not spoken about. Like the majority of the pedaphiles are democrats, the war mongers are democrats and more democrats have imprisoned minorities, maimed and killed brown people throughout the world, including the Clintons. I won\u2019t even go into the history of Biden or Kamala because I do not wish to engage in a political debate. People get too emotional about that. I am also aware that they talk bad about Trump because he is doing the right thing by taking down the evil cabal and the deep state. In sum it is unfair to call Kanye insane. Being bipolar is not insanity. That condition is not limited to celebrities. Many normal acting people have been labeled bipolar. And whether they are or not is not even the point. Whether Kanye admits to being bipolar is not the issue. The issue is that insanity is not equivalent to being bipolar. ",

            "answer_text": "He has a mental illness called Bipolar Disorder. I believe he has type 1 like I do. Bipolar disorder means being way too happy or too sad at any given moment, to over simplify it. Most people can imagine what it\u2019s like to be depressed but mania is where people struggle to understand. Biggest and primary concern for depression is suicide. About half of people with BP will attempt suicide at least once and 1 in 5 people actually kill themselves. Our life expectancy is estimated to be 20 years shorter than a normal persons. As if this wasn\u2019t scary, let\u2019s talk about mania. You would think being the opposite of depressed would be great right? Sort of. It hits everyone a little different but it usually starts off with not being able to sleep/having a ton of energy. Sounds cool right? Imagine coming into work after not sleeping for 4 days straight. Your body Is so tired that you can\u2019t keep your eyes open while driving but your brain feels so awake that it can\u2019t even process what needing sleep would even feel like. We like to take on way more than we can chew, like start multiple projects around the house or volunteer for things you normally would think you don\u2019t have the time for. Actually, a fair amount of musicians including Hasley have BP. Many say they will write all their music right at the start of a manic episode and finish an album after not sleeping for 2 months so lots of people like us opt for project based jobs with flexible schedules. This is what Kanye refers to as \u201cBipolar is a superpower\u201d in his latest album. Ok so we are super heroes who want to kill themselves but have a ton of energy, that doesn\u2019t sound toooooo bad right? Let\u2019s talk about the bad side of mania since everyone likes to pretend like it doesn\u2019t exist when in reality, most hospitalizations occurs when people are actually manic, not depressive. Imagine thinking you are the smartest, most attractive, best person in the world. You are/feel super hot so you flirt with everyone you can find. You might even make some really questionable choices like sleeping around with your friends partner because you feel like you have no inhibitions. Not cool. Bye partner. You might think your stupid boss at work is completely incompetent and you might call her out on it\u2026 publicly\u2026 in the middle of the office because she tried to give you constructive criticism. Or you stop listening to what she tells you to do and make up your own schedule of things you find to actually be important. Or maybe you start coming in late because you feel like you\u2019re so important to the company that they could never fire you. You might see how keeping a job is difficult for us. Unfortunately, most of us don\u2019t qualify for disability because we can \u201cphysically\u201d still work even if it\u2019s \u201cfor lower wages or basic jobs\u201d so we work at a job for a few months before quitting/getting fired and having to find another job. Normally this wouldn\u2019t be too terrible except loss of job usually means loss of health insurance and everyone with BP MUST TAKE MEDICATION TO FUNCTION. What? Define function. basically all the dumb shit Kanye does\u2026 I hate to say\u2026 can be attributed to his disorder. Off medicine I\u2019ll say the worst things to the best people, or I\u2019ll start hearing/seeing hallucinations, or I get bad paranoia and think my doctors are poisoning me. We also have this thing called pressured speech which causes us to blurt out the worst things at the worst times which I\u2019ve seen Kanye do. So yeah, we are bat shit crazy but most people wouldn\u2019t know as long as we are on medication. There are different degrees of course. I have a pretty severe diagnosis but there are people out there that only have depression (type 2) and people who just don\u2019t have serious symptoms. Type 1 has the worst rap since we can look crazy bouncing off the walls learning 3 foreign languages at once to not being able to get out of bed the next day. Yes, I think WE are crazy. But not any more crazy than anyone else with a mood disorder like schizophrenia or borderline. Luckily there is medication but no matter what you have to live your life. There\u2019s a terrible stigma with mental disorders because people label us as \u201ccrazy\u201d which does have a shred of truth to it but we are also \u201csuperhero\u2019s\u201d who have seen and faced it all. We are resilient, brave, and talented in so many ways as a result of our illnesses. ",
