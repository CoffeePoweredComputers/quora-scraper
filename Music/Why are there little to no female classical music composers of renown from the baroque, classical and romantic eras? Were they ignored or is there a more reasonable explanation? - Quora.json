            "answer_text": "They weren\u2019t \u2018ignored\u2019. They weren\u2019t there. There are exceptions, beginning in the 18th century. But for most of the history of music, being a composer also meant being a full-time professional musician. Haydn and Bach and Mozart didn\u2019t just compose, they also performed, conducted, led ensembles, functioned as Kapellmeisters, etc. Well, Mozart less so, but that was the usual role of composers in his day. Now, before the 20th century, were women routinely expected to go out and earn a living in a professional career, or were they expected to find suitable husbands? If you said \u2018find suitable husbands\u2019, well done you. Professional musician was a man\u2019s job, for centuries. It was only in the 18th century that women were even allowed to perform on stage. There were, nevertheless, women composers, certainly from the 18th century on. But there were few of them, and because there were so few, there were relatively few really notable ones. Remember that most people rarely listen to any composers but the most famous and most renowned ones from any era: Bach sooner than Corelli, Mozart sooner than Gluck, and Corelli and Gluck are very fine composers indeed. So the most famous women composers of the past are the best of the few who dared, or were allowed, to do it at all. The others are mostly, you know\u2026fine. On the same levels as their equally un-listened-to male colleagues. There\u2019s a lot of perfectly decent music out there, from all periods. It\u2019s just that when even the best is largely unfamiliar to people, we don\u2019t usually point people at the stuff that\u2019s just perfectly decent. But here\u2019s an example: part of a violin sonata by Francesca Lebrun (1756\u20131791), who was also a celebrated singer and an exact contemporary of Mozart (even dying at the same age as him).

            "answer_text": "I have been through this several times before. There were several female composers in the baroque era that were well known and respected in their day, but their music has been suppressed by later male dominated societies. Elizabeth Claude Jacquet de la Guerre was one of the favourite composers at the court of Louis XIV. In Italy, Barbara Strozzi and Isabella Leonarda were prominent. Leonarda wrote the first opera by a woman. In the classical and romantic eras, there were several female composers who had the aptitude but not the opportunity. Both Mozart's sister Nannerl and Mendelssohn's sister Fanny were talented composers, and their respective brothers encouraged them to compose, but would not let them publish. Clara Schumann and Alma Mahler both composed music before marriage, but felt it was more important to support their husbands careers than to continue composing. French composer, Louise Farrenc is unjustly neglected. She was the only woman on the staff of the Paris Conservatoire when it was under the direction of Faure and was well respected by her peers and left behind a major body of work that really needs reevaluation. The same applies for English composer Rebecca Clarke who wrote a very fine piano trio that is sometimes heard, but the remainder of her work needs reevaluation. Germaine Tailleferre was the only female member of the French group of composers known as Les Six. And last but by no means least is Lili Boulanger, sister of the more famous Nadia Boulanger. Lili was ill for most of her life and died at the tragic age of 24. She didn't leave behind much music, but her work is full of potential and had she lived she would have been among the really greats. Her sister Nadia composed in her younger days, but gave it up when she became aware of her sisters talent and instead had a very long and fruitful life as a composition teacher. Among her students were many of the greatest 20th century composers. She promoted her sister Lili\u2019s composing techniques for the rest of her long and distinguished career and imparted them to many of her students. So, indirectly Lili Boulanger was very influential. ",
