            "answer_text": "In my experience, yes. Does it have the same pride of ownership that your [insert American manufacturer or luthier] or, in the event of classical guitars, [insert name of Spanish luthier] No. Don't expect it to. [What's the old quote, \u201cHell is other people\u201d?] In my geography, you can full-on expect people to attempt to pronounce a four syllable Japanese proper noun by replacing as many of the short vowel sounds with their schwa counterpart as necessary to try and reconcile quality and price vs the fact it wasn't made entirely by hand in the US or Western Europe. Because? With the advent of multi-axis machining the process has become more about quality in, quality out [You can't replace quality control] and the finish and \u201cpolish\" than the absolute repeatability of all components at a given temperature and humidity. I have a Paul Reed Smith SE Standard 24, which is made in South Korea and not Maryland. I can tell the difference, but it is my current favorite as for less than the cost of a Mexican made Stratocaster it is the most effortless guitar I have ever played that wasn't the cost of a decent used car. The only more stable instrument with regard to action and intonation is a bespoke Carvin I had built back when Kiesel had yet to do the separate brand thing. It's not fancy, but it is an amazing instrument in both the PRS and Carvin and here again, machining and quality control vs what makes that possible. I was trying not to use electric guitar examples, but Takamine is the reason I never bought a Martin or a Taylor or the mythological guitar made by the mountain hermit. It was the guitar I could afford and it gave me little reason but vanity to upgrade. These days, my son has it, and my acoustic of choice is even less expensive but admittedly plays like an electric as I have the fingers of a pianist and I don't like trying to convince myself that a thick neck with an impossible radius for my hands is awesome because of who made it. In that case, look for the highest rated thin acoustic guitar you can find under $200. ",

            "answer_text": " Do Takamine make great guitars? Yeah, I have 2 and love both of them. I have been playing for many years. I\u2019ve played or owned a lot of guitars. I prefer the tonewood of mahogany backs and Red Cedar tops. Cedar has an open top. It is similar to redwood but it is less expensive. My EN-20C is a NEX Jumbo and is a beautiful guitar. I honestly say it is one of the best guitars that I\u2019ve ever heard. It is a large and expressive tone guitars. I really love this one and it\u2019s a keeper! I don\u2019t want to brag about Takamines. Tak owners are faithfully fans. They are great and the Japanese guitars are made in the Takamine Mountains. So, just today, I saw the Premier Guitar on a tour of the Takamine Factory. I will link it below. It is cool to see how they are made in the factory. Takamine Factory Tour ",
