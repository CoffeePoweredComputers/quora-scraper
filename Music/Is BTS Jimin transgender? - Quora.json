            "answer_text": "The answers to this question make me giggle. I don\u2019t know if this was a serious question, but I\u2019m going to answer it seriously. As far as we know, no, he isn\u2019t, and I\u2019m about 99% sure he isn\u2019t, if we\u2019re talking female to male transgender. And so far, unless he comes out as male to female transgender, or any other non-cisgender gender, he is not and uses male pronouns.I want to remind everyone that having abs and an Adam\u2019s apple showing doesn\u2019t prove the masculinity of a man, nor does the voice. Jimin can lower his voice actually quite impressively when speaking (as heard in Cleopatra games BTS has done). Just because he has abs doesn\u2019t prove he\u2019s a man . Also, plenty of women have Adam\u2019s apple showing, it\u2019s just not as often. Either way, no, he\u2019s still not transgender.However, someone did show baby pictures of him in another answer, and yeah, basically, no, he isn\u2019t. He was born male.Overall, Jimin is a beautiful human being. If he ever came out, I hope people would support him no matter what. Instead, what\u2019s important is his hard work and dedication, the care and affection he has for others, and that fans love him for him. ",

            "answer_text": "NO. Good lord. There are embarrassingly cringe videos of his male anatomy bouncing around on the internet because hard stans don't know when they\u2019ve crossed a line. Look, he did purposely put a bigender sign on his hand during a photoshoot and people have just decided to speak for him for some reason and interpret that action as if they were him. Only Jimin and maybe his close friends/family knows how he identifies gender wise but I\u2019m almost 100% certain his junk is still there. And LGBTQ+ community, I am literally one of you, but y\u2019all need to chill with this BTS is gay agenda. Assuming their sexualities to make yourself feel more comfortable in yours is immature and means you are not ready for sex much less to publicly speak on it. You also need to stop saying everyone who says BTS isn\u2019t gay/trans/bi/etc is a homophobe. Assuming their sexuality whether it is straight, gay, pan , a ,etc is NOT okay and crossing a serious line. Y\u2019all care way too much about people who are not you. ",
