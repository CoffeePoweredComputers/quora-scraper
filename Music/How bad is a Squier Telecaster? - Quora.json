            "answer_text": "Tone and play-ability varies from guitar to guitar, year to year and country to country. There\u2019s so much you can do to make a guitar great and top tier Squier\u2019s are generally decent guitars. I have taken guitars apart and the two Chinese Squier CV50\u2019s in my possession had alder wood parts glued together to make a guitar body. One sounded okay and the other thin. The necks are decent if you\u2019re not gigging with it night after night, remove the tremolo (if it\u2019s a strat, you don\u2019t have to worry about that on a tele) and know how to do a fret job, how to set up a guitar with shim, nut, etc. That knowledge is just a few youtube videos and googles away. On CV50\u2019s and Classic Vibes the tuners are decent. The electronics hiss more than they should. They use an electronic switch I\u2019m not fond of, but switches are cheap and wiring diagrams are free. Just google \u201ctele wiring diagrams\u201d. Some folks don\u2019t believe in tone wood and that\u2019s fine. Just change the pickups. Soldering is easy. Plenty of videos on how to solder. Some of the stock pickups are pretty good, especially if you change the capacitors. I happen to like dark capacitors 1uf in my tele\u2019s and strat\u2019s and brighter ones in my Gibson\u2019s. Some years Squier has been almost on par with Fender MIA (Protone Cort Factory Made In Korea 1996\u20131998) and some years they\u2019re awful. I\u2019m not a fan of most Chinese guitars but there are Made in America and Made in Japan Squiers that are amazing. Again, if you use youtube, google, and are willing to invest time, effort and money (dowel\u2019s, sandpaper, tape, files, black markers, steel wool) you can make a Squier Tele into an excellent player guitar almost on par with many Made in Mexico guitars. The key is to get low action, soft frets with rounded soft corners. It\u2019s time consuming but not as hard as it sounds. Good luck and have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "Loaded question. Squier guitars are excellent value, most of the time. Buying a squier strat with a cheap squier amp, or one of those packages that has a gig bag and other accessories, is a tremendously good idea for new guitarists. If you\u2019re a parent with a child interested in guitar, consider this because of the value. If your kid is still playing in a few years and is pretty good, then think about a nicer guitar or larger amp maybe. I own several guitars and have been playing since 8 or 9, my guitar was a squier strat and I played that exclusively until I bought an American strat and a Gibson LP in my mid 20s when I had the means to do so. No, you\u2019re not going to get a warm, bold tone from a squier guitar and amp, but it\u2019s good enough until you actually know what you\u2019re doing. ",

            "answer_text": "Why phrase the question that way? It sounds like you\u2019ve already decided before you\u2019ve asked. The \u201cVintage Modified\u201d and \u201cClassic Vibe\u201d line are very consistently good guitars throughout the Squier range. I noodled on a Vintage Modified Jazzmaster last time I was in my local shop - pretty impressive. The \u201cStandard\u201d series are usually perfectly serviceable. I would steer clear of the \u201cAffinity\u201d and the rock-bottom \u201cBullet\u201d series, not because they cannot also be good guitars, but because they are probably going to require service (fret leveling / crowning and setup) to play as well as the Standard. Really it just comes down to whether you want a brand-new guitar or not. You can get a new Squier Classic Vibe Tele for about what a used Mexican made Fender costs. ",
