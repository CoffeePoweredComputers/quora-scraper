It was cut into pieces to make change (\u201cpieces of eight\u201d for Pirate fans). The US Quarter (25 cents)  was the equivalent of \u201ctwo bits\u201d of the Spanish dollar. The Spanish dollar was legal tender for the first decades of the US, by the way,  all the way to 1857. And that is why the US has a 25 cent coin. We have also has half cents, cents, 2 cent pieces, 3 cent pieces,  5 cent pieces, 10 cent pieces, 20 cent pieces , 50 cent pieces, and dollar coins. Not to  mention $2 coins, $3 coins, $4 coins, $5 coins, $10 and $20 coins. And a $50 commemorative coin as well. Confused yet? ",
