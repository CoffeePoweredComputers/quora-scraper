            "answer_text": "My company\u2019s blog actually has an article called How to Sell Music Online that holds the answer to this particular question. :) In the blog, we talk about our top five digital music stores\u2014CD Baby, Tunescore, DistroKid, Loudr, and Rumblefish\u2014how they differ, and what each one offers.  For example, if you love producing covers, than Loudr is the way to go. If you also want to license your music for use in movies, TV shows, or other projects that need great soundtracks, then perhaps Rumblefish is just right for you. Naturally, CD Baby is probably the most well-known one and the one everyone opts for in the end. :)  Like I said, you can take a look at the article we\u2019ve written and then get more details about each and every one of them. I\u2019d just like to add one more thing before I leave you to your exploring: it\u2019s extremely important to create a fantastic recording if you want it to sell. If it\u2019s anything short of fantastic, your track won\u2019t be a success. Now, I understand that recording in a professional studio can cost a lot of money and that not everyone has the budget to do so, but that\u2019s where online studios\u2014like Supreme Tracks\u2014can really come in handy. These types of services are much more affordable, but will offer you the same quality as if you were to record in a physical studio (so to speak). In any case, I wish you luck in your future music endeavors and I hope I helped you out. :) ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, Bandcamp is one of the best services for selling music. It's not the most well known, but you can do it all for free and it's easy for both you and buyers. As soon as you have an account, you can upload audio files as songs or albums that people can access from your main page. And, you can put a price on these songs and albums; set up a PayPal account to get your earnings (you either get all of it, or most, I forgot). Bandcamp also lets you sell \u2018merchandise\u2019, so if you meant selling scores and not audio, you could probably figure out how to do that using Bandcamp too. There may even be a way for customers to pay you for sheet music in the form of PDFs\u2026I haven't really looked into it too much, but it sounds promising. FYI: I'm not advertising for Bandcamp; I just have a personal opinion that it's a great service, despite not being as well known as iTunes or Spotify. Also, if you really want to gain a sizable audience, then I would recommend releasing compositions on multiple platforms, because some people only use, for example, Spotify. Bandcamp is a great way to give people an easy way to buy your music, but it's not exactly the greatest to use for promoting your music. I hope that I helped a bit\u2026 ",

I don't know how it goes on with others but I've managed to make a pretty penny with MGcash. I hope for more, of course, in all senses. But for a start I believe I'm doing pretty well. I sell music online and, who knows, maybe tomorrow I'll do that in a more profitable traditional way.http://mgcash.com/soundcloud/ ",
