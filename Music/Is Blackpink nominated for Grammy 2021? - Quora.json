            "answer_text": "There has been a rule change, which means that there is a high chance that Blackpink might be nominated for the Best New Artist category. Recently, in an interview, with Billboard Magazine, Harvey Mason Jr., CEO pf the Recording Academy has implemented nine important changes to the nomination process of Grammy Awards. According to Mason, the rule that an artist who has released no more than 30 songs will be nominated in this category has been removed by the Academy. After few years, Mason realizes that the rule was impossible to achieve and didn't present a fair chance for new artists. He added that the rule also posed a problem for rap and hip hope artists, who tend to relate more than 30 songs than required with just two mixtapes, which differences from the number of other artists, thus creating a inequality between the number of songs that could be produced for two different types of artists among the industry. He has also expressed, regret for the artist that couldn't be nominated, because of this rule, but because of the change in this rule, now these artists and talents can be able to feel encouraged to create more songs and branch out to different sounds and styles without feeling hindered by the aforementioned rule. Because of this new change in rules, the groups BTS and Blackpink now have a high possibility of being nominated. Mason has expressed his regret for their inability to be nominated because they released over 30 songs, despite all their hard work and effort put into it. With success on their album Map of the Soul 7 and the new rule change, fans still hope that they will be nominated in 2021. however because they have already a worldwide influence, and related many songs in their career, it is difficult for this to pursue this nomination, so the only chance for nomination is Blackpink, who has released a music video called Lovesick Girls. we could only hope that it gains achievements and popularity enough for them to be able to be nominated for this category. In addition to this major change in the rules for the \u201cBest New Artist\u201d nomination, the Academy also revised a number of other award categories such as changing the name of the \u201cBest Urban Contemporary Album\u201d to \u201cBest Progressive R&B Album\u201d, the \u201cBest Rap / Sung Performance\u201d award to \u201cBest Melodic Rap Performance\u201d. To ensure transparency, they will be posted on the Grammy official website. ",
