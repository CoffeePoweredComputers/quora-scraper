            "answer_text": "Understanding stuff like this is less about reciting academic learning than thinking about what must have transpired over the eons of human development. The preceding answers are all factually correct, but I, as well as the querent, might not find these responses adequate to explain the presence of the semi-tone gaps amidst the whole tone gaps. The question was \u201cwhy\u201d, and we ought to address that. The problem in doing so is that \u201cwhy\u201d is totally conjectural. That might give pause to any scrupulously authoritative explainer, but not me. I\u2019m not afraid to go out on a limb with wild, haphazard speculation. To wit: Here is my nutshell theory of the evolution of musical scales. Troglodytes sitting around the fire they light to ward off predatory beasts amused themselves by pounding out rhythmic sounds on available items. Soon, atonal grunting in time to this \u201cmusic\u201d ensues. (Please avoid gratuitous comparisons to rap; it\u2019s not the same thing at all.)One tribe\u2019s chief rhythmist, let\u2019s call him \u201cOg\u201d (a name, not the acronym \u201cO.G.\u201d), sets the beat for the nightly drum circle. Og is really good at this. He has two drums, one for each hand. People notice that Og\u2019s drums have slightly different pitches. When he hits each drum, those who are joining in by grunting, start varying the pitch of their grunts trying to match the pitch of Og\u2019s drumbeats. Thus, we get two-tone music. (Imagine that scene in cheesy movies where the explorers sneak up to the native celebration where one of their number, previously captured, is being spit-roasted or is about to be burned at the stake.)Og\u2019s female descendant, Na, has a high, birdlike voice. She has noticed that her musical grunts at the regular nightly drum circle are not the same as those of the older men and women participating. Many say that she sounds like a bird. She thinks so, too, so she imitates their songs. Generally, these have five tones or less. The harmonic spacing of these tones is the result of the physical, acoustic properties of the sound-producing object. That is, certain intervals, like the perfect fourth and fifth, occur when air passes through the same sound chamber at varying speeds. Na doesn\u2019t know any of this, but imitating the birds she listens to during the daylight hours, she mimics their pentatonic songs at night around the fire as the drums and gourds pound out ancient rhythms, some of which go all the way back to Og. (We\u2019re up to five tones now.)That pentatonic scale is so handy and versatile that no one feels any need to expand on its use for several millennia. Civilization and cultures evolve, and with such developments, music becomes more varied and complex. Musical instruments evolve and vocal styles develop where the tonal spacing of the tones used becomes formalized. Standards evolve to tune and match the tones of separate instruments, allowing groups of musicians to play in unison without cacophony. Even today, many cultures have seen no need to use more than five different tones within the range of an octave. Having more or fewer tones in the octave doesn\u2019t have any bearing on the sophistication or level of development of a culture; it\u2019s simply a testament of to the fact that five tones is plenty and one can do a lot with just that many. (Analyze guitar solos in popular music to hear this.)As music develops into a complex art form, musicians infuse different ideas to provide distinctive sounds not heard before. However, to be accepted by the music establishment, anything new has to coexist smoothly within the generally accepted framework. One of the things introduced in Europe was the insertion of two additional tones into the standard pentatonic framework. The gap between two pairs of tones in the five-tone scheme is larger (by about 50%) than the gap between the other three pairs of adjacent tones. Musicians began using two intermediate tones in these wider gaps that were positioned to provide some pleasing harmonic properties. In both cases, the intermediate tones were closer to the higher-pitched tone than the lower-pitched tone. They could have \u201csplit the difference\u201d, but when anyone tried that, the resulting tones, 1.5 semitones above the lower-pitched tone, sounded horribly discordant. To Western ears, the sound of an intermediate tone 2/3 of the way up to the higher tone was more pleasing. So, they tried that and stuck with it, formalizing the heptatonic (seven-tone) scale. At this point, we have fully-formed Western music. (Rock on!)People started playing music with this seven-tone scale. They discovered that if you start with different tones, the scale sounds different. Thus, \u201cmodes\u201d were invented. They went nuts. All kinds of musical instruments were created to play music with various seven-tone scales. Then, one day, somebody had an epiphany.They took a long, hard look at how the scale was organized and pondered about how to solve a musical problem that had arisen because of the uneven musical intervals. The problem presents itself like this: \u201cI like this riff. It\u2019s really cool. After I play it, I want to repeat it, but at a slightly higher pitch. When I try to just start the riff on a slightly higher pitch, it sounds completely different. How can I play the same thing higher or lower on the same instrument and have it sound the same, but just higher or lower?\u201d Some clever person with a good ear said, \u201cIt sounds different because we\u2019ve only got seven tones in our scale. If we added more tones \u2018in the cracks\u2019 between the tones we have, we could play anything starting anywhere.\u201d So, that\u2019s what they did. Musical instruments were modified to play five more tones in an octave, which then made twelve more or less evenly spaced tonal intervals between the tones within the range of an octave. On a piano, they stuck in black keys. Since there were already two pairs of adjacent tones that were only separated by a half tone, which didn\u2019t need another tone inserted between them, only five black keys were added instead of seven in each octave. But, then they noticed something odd.The first people who tried to play a melody some number of semi-tones higher must have been horribly disappointed. It just didn\u2019t sound the same even though they had carefully tuned their new twelve-tone instruments to split the old whole-tone intervals in half to create a chromatic scale. It should work, right? Why didn\u2019t it?After thinking about it a while, people who played instruments, like violins, cellos and trombones, that had smoothly variable pitch control, smoothed out the intervals in the twelve-tone scale so that they could play any melody they wanted starting at any pitch, but it would sound exactly the same, just higher or lower. In other words, they worked out the even-tempered scale by ear. The reason the even tempered scale is different than what they had been using before is that the old tuning was base on Pythagorean intervals deduced in antiquity to define a five-tone scale. Those playing fretless stringed instruments and trombones only had to learn how to hold down the strings or position the slide at slightly different places. Dealing with instruments with fixed tuning was slightly more challenging, but eventually people with perfect pitch, like Bach, figured out how to adjust their instruments to play scales with even temperament. Those crafting fretted stringed instruments like guitars had the biggest challenge. They had to learn how to place the frets on a logarithmic scale long before people knew what that was!It was only about a century ago that composers really started to toy with the idea of doing something radically different with scales that didn\u2019t stick mostly to some kind of seven-tone scale with five whole-tone intervals and two semi-tone intervals. Whenever they used any of the five tones that were not present in the current set of seven tones they were nominally using, these \u201cin the crack\u201d tones were called \u201caccidentals\u201d, as if one were making a mistake. The conventions of musical notation were such that deviating from a seven-tone scale always involved more cumbersome representation. There\u2019s no real reason to organize music notation and instrument keyboards this way, but the old system based on seven-tone scales has persisted because musicologists are unwilling to give up these antiquated schemes most people find incomprehensible. Keyboards could be built that had all the keys next to each other. You could also have six white keys, and six black ones, in an octave. (I think it would be easier to play because an octave would only be six keys wide rather than seven.) Fretted stringed instruments are built using a chromatic, twelve-tone scheme, so why not pianos? Hmmm?So, do you get the \u201cwhy\u201d now? The half-tone interval between B and C, and between E and F, is a side effect of adding two more tones to a pentatonic scale that sounded decent. It\u2019s nothing arcane or mystical. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is probably a little disappointing: when Boethius was setting out the gamut \u2014 the set of available notes, so called because the lowest note was a gamma \u2014 he happened to use seven or eight notes per octave, and when he did that, the notes B and C were closer together than other adjacent notes, as were E and F. This was before note names even repeated at the octave; after G came H, I, K, L, etc. (no J because that letter didn\u2019t even exist yet). It started at A, and gamma was added later when people needed a note below A. By the time of Gregorian chant, there were eight notes in the octave, and these notes did indeed repeat: you had A Bb/B C D E F G, then A again, Bb/B again, and so on. These notes were organized such that you could always get a perfect fifth above and below a note: C has F below and G above, D has G below and A above, E has A below and B above, G has C below and D above, A has D below and E above. The problem notes here are B and F, because they form a tritone, not a perfect fifth. The solution is to also allow a Bb. So a fifth above F is C and a fifth below is Bb, and a fifth below B is E and a fifth above Bb is F. You can make a chain of fifths: Bb F C G D A E B. In modern times, with the 12-note scale, we could go all the way around a circle, but they didn\u2019t have a 12-note scale; they only had the 7-note scale (where one of those 7 notes could be flat or natural). If you start at F (forget the Bb for now) and go up by fifths, each of which has a frequency ratio of 3/2, you eventually get a 5-note scale that looks like a kind of pentatonic scale: C D F G A. The notes C and D, F and G, and G and A all have the same interval between them, 9/8, while D and F and A and C have a bigger interval, 32/27. Now, if you add one more note, the E, it will fall inside the gap between the D and F, but it will be closer to the F than to the D. The interval between D and E is 9/8, but the interval between E and F is 256/243. If you add the B, that\u2019s another 256/243. If you want these numbers in cents, where 100 cents is a 12-tone half step and 200 cents is a whole step, the 9/8 interval is about 204 cents, the 32/27 interval is about 294 cents, and the 256/243 interval is about 90 cents, so you can see that the space between E and F and between B and C is about half of the space between C and D, D and E, F and G, G and A, and A and B. Now, you might be asking, what about the Bb? Well, you should have followed directions. I told you to forget about it, and if you\u2019re asking this, you clearly didn\u2019t forget about it. So now I guess I have to explain that too. The Bb is also 256/243 above A, and as far as music in the Gregorian chant era is concerned, we\u2019re done, because they would never have directly used the interval between Bb and B; it was always either one or the other. But as music progressed, people kept filling in those 204-cent intervals with something in between. The tuning got varied and complicated, because it turns out that the 408-cent (81/64) major thirds sounded terrible and a different third at about 386 cents (5/4) was much nicer, leading to incompatibilities galore until equal temperament came along much, much later. Eventually we pretty much settled on filling in the 200-odd-cent intervals with just one note about halfway between, and those new intervals turn out to be the same or similar to the intervals between E and F and B and C, so there was no need to fill those gaps with anything. 7 note names plus 5 notes filling in the larger gaps yields 12 notes total, which is what we ended up with. Of course, we in the West could have done things differently. We could have opted for 19 notes per octave, which would have meant that there are two notes inside the bigger gaps (C, C#, Db, D, D#, Eb, E) and one note inside the smaller gaps (E, E#/Fb, F, F#, Gb, G, G#, Ab, A, A#, Bb, B, B#/Cb, C). If we had done that, our fifths would have been less in tune but our thirds would have been much more in tune. On the down side, our leading tones would have been less unstable and therefore have less leading power. The Turks actually ended up with a 53-tone system which could accommodate both an in-tune fifth and an in-tune third, but it would pretty much break harmony (which is not really present in Turkish music so it\u2019s not a problem for them). But we Westerners ended up with a 7-note system that\u2019s a subset of a 12-note system, and in our Western way of doing things, that means that some of those 7 notes are closer together than others!
