            "answer_text": "okay so\u2026this is just my opinion. if you like tony kakkar I don\u2019t mind it but this is just what I think about his songs. this answer is not just about \u2018his\u2019 song but the general scene of Bollywood songs(not all but most). so here\u2019s my \u201ctheory\u201d: Most Indians are casual music listeners. Casual music listeners (DISCLAIMER: in no way am I saying such people have a bad taste in music. I respect everyone\u2019s taste in music.) are listeners who listen to music that is trending or on top 40 or 20 list. they have no special interest towards lyrics(which is nothing bad) or meaning or artist etc. casual listeners listen to the songs that are made for the general masses i.e. songs that suits the public appeal. From what I have seen, there is only a small portion of Indian population who listen to specific artists or genres or have a very peculiar taste is music. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they listen to international music or classical music or folk music. In no way I want to make it look like \u2018this\u2019 group of people are superior or something like that. The point I want to make is that \u201cthis\u201d[the ones having peculiar taste] exactly know what kind of music they like/dislike. they are open to all kinds of songs/music; irrespective of the genre, the artist, the language etc. they know what they like to listen and if they don\u2019t like something they simply don\u2019t listen to it. The other part of the population are casual listeners who listen to songs for beats or vibe or just because everyone else is listening to the song. Now again, I\u2019m not looking down upon people who are casual listeners. WHY AM I SAYING THIS? because my brother is a casual listener and I\u2019m the peculiar one. and in fact he\u2019s the one who always keeps on telling me that I listen to some \u201cunbearable/ boring\u201d music[ he\u2019s a really nice brother. he just likes to annoy me]. So now since I gave you some \u201cbackground idea\u201d let me get to the point. Tony Kakkar makes the songs that gets casual listener hooked. I\u2019m not saying that Tony Kakkar is a bad singer or something like that. in fact he is a very smart guy who knows what is \u2018sellable\u2019 and sticks to that formula. On the other hand, indie artists who; most of the times; just want to make music they could be proud of, [ I can say this because I too am an aspiring music producer n would definitely care more about making music that I could be proud of] don\u2019t have the main stream appeal like tony kakkar and his songs does. As I wrote earlier, there\u2019s kinda of a formula that works with the general public. the formula is : upbeat music/ higher beats per minuterelatable lyricscatchy melodya high budget music videothe upbeat music keeps us excited. the catchy melody hooks our brain into the song. the lyrics[ most of the times I find them cringy as fuck] are something easy to remember or related to more to our generation, that somehow we find relatable[ for eg. coca-cola tu]. and lastly the music video, that somehow attracts teens and adults. the most illogical music video by tony kakkar according to me is \u201ckuch kuch hota hai\u201d. In it some clearly visible late 20s \u201cadults\u201d are seen wearing school uniform and doing the regular Bollywood stuff i.e. : LADKI PATTO. and some how today\u2019s 15 year olds and even 20 year olds find that very unique and cute. To be even more specific- A TONY KAKAR SONG HAS ALL OF THIS. his songs are upbeat, lyrical they are very basic. melody is catchy. I\u2019ve noticed that his song \u2018coco-cola\u2019 and \u2018dheeme-dheeme\u2019 has similar melody. the music videos attract the youth. along with this his management team is also really good. they have or rather had used tik-tok as a tool to blow up the songs. his sister promotes his songs etc. TO CONCLUDE : tony is a smart guy. he knows how public\u2019s mind work and uses it to his advantage. he keeps his songs light, understandable and something youth could easily comprehend. that is why people love his songs. I just wish that Indian indie artists pick up a few management/promotion techniques from him and use it. Indian music industry is practically non-existing and bollywood is the only major source of songs. P.S.: I hope my answer is satisfactory enough and I don\u2019t look down upon casual listeners. In fact it\u2019s me who is always been looked down upon \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude05. I\u2019m not complaining just saying. just a recommendation: listen to \u201cRajakumari\u201d.\u270c(peace\u2026and not victory). ",
