            "answer_text": "Gaming laptop is good for everything. Most gaming laptops are about the same weight as any other laptop of the same screen size. If you are comparing 14\u2033 laptop with 15.6\u2033 laptop in weight, you are simply being absurd. 14\u2033 screen does not have big enough screen or numpad which makes it really different from 15.6\u2033 ones. I never use 14\u2033 laptop as I find it stressful to my eyes and I need numpad. So, if you compare similar sized laptops, there is no real disadvantage of gaming laptops. Even battery life can be extended by buying bigger battery laptops like ASUS TUF A15 with 90Whr battery and also by using the default software of fan control to undervolt. ",
