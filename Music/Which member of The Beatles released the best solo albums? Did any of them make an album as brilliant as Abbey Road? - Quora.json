            "answer_text": "The answer is that 1 does not equal 4. All had a contender though. Harrison\u2019s best is presumed to be All Things Must Pass. It has many great songs, which might have appeared on a Beatles album. But the production gives the album songs songs that sound much alike like the wall of sound the producer was famous for. It lacks the variety of sounds the Beatles excelled in, as Abbey Road had. Great album but sounds like George from beginning to end and not much like the others. Ringo came close with his hit Ringo album featuring all 4 Beatles, but not all four on any one song. While the album has many charms, the songs seem to lack the classic feel of songs you get on a Beatles album. Photograph by Harrison seems the closest to a song contender. You\u2019re Sixteen seems more from the Beatles early albums. Both were hit singles, adding to the album\u2019s overall excellence. John\u2019s albums seem more hit or miss. Imagine is the album most considered to be a contender. The title tune and a few others seem to be Beatles level songs. Imagine could fit on many of their albums, a true classic song. Some of the others were started as white album songs but finished later. The self contemplative themes are powerful but outside of the title tune the rest seem more suited for the white album giving the album a lack of variety to be found on most classic Beatles albums. Last but not least, Paul and Wings Band on the Run album featuring himself on many instruments like drums, lead guitar, bass, and piano and Denny Laine on most everything else, with both and Linda winning a Grammy for best vocal group for their work on this album make BOTR a contender. It has a multi-part pop suite in the title track like the side 2 suite but condensed into a single song, and the roaring rocker \"Jet\" became the 1st hit single. Let Me Roll It is a song that is in John\u2019s style of song production in that mid 70\u2019s era and is an earnest compliment/tribute to Paul\u2019s former song partner. Picasso\u2019s last Words is perhaps a better song in comparison to A.R.\u2019s Maxwell\u2019s Silver hammer character song. Bluebird and Mamunia are harmony oriented ballads. All of the songs would be suitable for placement on any later era Beatles album. The album has a rock band theme similar to Sgt Pepper and to the history of the Beatles to a degree. For overall quality of production and variety of song, Paul\u2019s album wins as a comparison to Abbey Road. It only lacks John Ringo and George to make it a perfect Abbey Road followup. It was also a critical, fan, and sales winner, beating the other albums in sales and spawned 3 top singles. (By the way Lennon praised the album in Rolling stone magazine, having moved past his \u201cHow do you Sleep\u201d phase. And Rolling Stone named it the album of the year in 1974!) ",

            "answer_text": "A solo album by any of The Beatles, no matter how good and some are as good as a solo album can possibly be, such as Plastic Ono Band, Band on the Run, and All Things Must Pass, they can never be as good as Abbey Road, and I\u2019ll even go as far to say, as any of The Beatles albums. Why? Because The Beatles albums have The Beatles on them. No album with just Paul McCartney\u2019s voice is ever going to match an album that has both his, John Lennon\u2019s, George Harrison\u2019s and Ringo\u2019s voice on it. Part of the magic of The Beatles is that they had two main lead singers, and sometimes lead singers in George and Ringo. Also the way the voices blend together in the harmonies is sheer magic missing from the solo works. Paul gets closest sometimes because Denny Lane\u2019s nasal voice often sounded a bit like John\u2019s in the harmonies. Abbey Road has that wonderful moment where all four members sing Carry That Weight. You don\u2019t get that on Walls and Bridges or Venus and Mars. And theoretically an album with just Lennon and McCartney on, done to a high standard, with both of them writing, taking leads, harmonising etc would surely outshine any solo work, if there had been one. Beatles albums have a chemistry that is unparalleled, there is an almost magic quality to them. The fact that those four men, and particularly John and Paul, being born in the same town, close enough together to meet, not just in time but in space, get on enough to form a lasting, healthy, working relationship and change the world of music, the way they did, almost proves the existence of magic. This doesn\u2019t diminish the greatness of some of the solo albums, but an Oliver Hardy solo movie would never have been as good as a Laurel and Hardy one. I\u2019m someone who can listen to The Beatles albums and just focus in on singing, and enjoy them purely on that level. I also think they possess most of the best songs ever written in their particular eras. ",
