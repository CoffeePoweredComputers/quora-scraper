            "answer_text": "Jim Davis's answer to Which music is the best? \u2026and so my answer doesn\u2019t get flagged for brevity: (alphabetically by genre/sub-genre; and no, not \u201cevery\u201d genre is included. That would be physically impossible. This is closer to about 10% of all genres/sub-genres. User-10174228721148850133 said it very well in his answer. Genres are more for labeling and marketing than for appreciation and true description. So here\u2019s a tiny tip of the enormous music genre iceberg for your enjoyment. Or annoyance. However you see fit. You\u2019re welcome.) Blues: Blues Rock; Similar to Electric Blues, but sometimes acoustic. Blues Rock can be played without having the power turned on. And it rocks.- Stoneground, Tommy Castro Band, Tom Waits, Jeff Healey, Chris Whitley, Paul Butterfield Blues BandChicago Blues; Sort of an urban blues using more piano and saxophone. These guys are quite often named Willie or \"Big\" something if not some kind of dog. Popular in Louisiana, strangely enough.- Willie Clarke, Willie Dixon, Willie Kent, Willie Murphy, Willie Nix, Big Bill Broonzy, Big Joe Turner, Big John Wrencher, Big Moose, Golden \"Big\" Wheeler, Eddie Shaw & The Wolf Gang, Hound Dog Taylor, Howlin' WolfDelta Blues; One of the earliest blues styles.

Best if played on the porch of an old, broken down shack.- Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, Keb 'Mo', Memphis Jug Band, Johnny Shines, Tommy Johnson, Frank StokesElectric Blues; Blues that's plugged in and louder.

Popular in Illinois, strangely enough.- Big Maybelle, Big Walter Horton, Roy Milton, Willie Mabon, Roosevelt Sykes, Yank Rachell, \"Ma\" Rainey, Percy MayfieldSwamp Blues; incorporates some Zydeco and more aggressive styles. Best when heard from the banks of a swamp and followed to an old, broken down shack.- Sonny Terry, Smiley Lewis, Luther Allison, Irma Thomas, Clifton Chenier, Doctor Ross, Bobby MarchanTexas Blues; more swing than Electric Blues, but more guitar than Jump Blues. Popular in Missouri, strangely enough.- Albert King, Lightnin' Hopkins, Tutu Jones, T-Bone Walker, Smokin' Joe Kubek, Grady Gains, Lafayette LeakeZydeco; more Creole influence. Accordion and alternative percussion instruments. You can't understand a word these guys are saying.- Al Rapone, Zydeco Boneshakers, Wayne Toups, Dr. John, The Mavericks, Buckwheat ZydecoGospel: somewhere between Blues and Country. Dominantly Christian in lyrical form. - The Staple Singers, Shirley Caesar, Mahalia Jackson, Ira Tucker & The Dixie Hummingbirds, The Golden Gate Quartet, Fisk Jubilee Singers, The Blind Boys of AlabamaCountry: Bluegrass; up-tempo roots country using fiddle, banjo, jug, washtub bass.

Drunken out-of-tune pianos and bar fights abound. Mostly second generation Country.- Rex Griffin, Lefty Frizzell, Hank Williams, Ernest Tubb, Jim Edward Brown, Red FoleyMountain; vocal harmonies, fast-pickin', nostalgia, and \"ya gotta have a fiddle in the band\". Judging by their names, they're usually related to someone if not each other. - Alabama, Oak Ridge Boys, Roy Acuff, The Forester Sisters, The Louvin Brothers, The Stanley Brothers, The Burch Sisters, The Cook Family SingersNeotraditional; the sort of \"we wish we'd been alive before country was cool\" artists. True to their form, but still \"new\". Mostly fifth generation Country.- Alan Jackson, Brad Paisley, Garth Brooks, Vince Gill, Mark ChesnuttOutlaw; the real deal. These guys invented the country themes; heartache, loss, being broke, depressed, lonely and/or in jail. Third and Fourth generation Country with no fancy band or artist names; just straight-forward actual names with lots of \"N\"s and \"L\"s. - Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams Jr., Charlie Daniels, David Allan Coe, Rodney Crowell, Leon RussellTraditional; the realer deal. Country for the sake of true mountain/southern expression. Hard workin' white trash sadness and hard times with an occasionally poppy feel later in the genre. Third and Fourth generation Country with lots of steel guitar twang, dobro, wailing fiddle and soft yet straight-forward 4/4 back beats that keep audiences clappin' on 1 and 3. - Loretta Lynn, Emmylou Harris, Porter Wagoner, Kenny Rogers, George Jones, Tanya Tucker, Ronnie Milsap, Dolly PartonWestern; Out on the range/prairie.

Mood music.... if you're in the mood to feel ambient.- Etro Anime, Sneaker Pimps, Ceasefire, Aphex Twin, Kinobe, HalcyonDubstep; characterized by sub-bass frequency oscillation and warbling along with broken beats, syncopation and \"the drop\". If you don't like it you're obviously too old.- Skrillex, Plastician, Magnetic Man, Nero, Deadmau5, SkreamHouse; a style of electronic dance music that grew from disco production and reggae beats. Don't know why it's called \"House\". Maybe it just sounded cool. - Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk, MARRS, Sonique, Dirty VegasTechno; a form of EDM synthesizing funk, jazz, African rhythms and a general party-type atmosphere. This music is often directly from the future or outerspace. - Arab Strap, Rednex, Technotronic, LeClick, Culture Beat, RozallaTrance; repetition repetition repetition. Beats between 125 and 140 bpm with lots of repetition. Melodic themes slowly layer and build to climaxes and then, you guessed it, repeat. - Life on Mars, Enigma, Blue States, B12, Craig Armstrong, AirTrip Hop; a more experimental style of electronic music that utilizes soul, funk, jazz, and blues forms. Sometimes danceable. Sometimes commercial. But always 100% hip-hop/ambient/soul/jazz/acid/dub/electronica. Or something... - Moby, Bossa Nostra, Fatboy Slim, Vanja Lazarova, Seph, Electric ChairsFolk: American Roots; 1800s' pre-Country acoustic. Not as upbeat as bluegrass.

Best enjoyed while under the influence of some sort of psychotropic substance. If sober, turn around and watch the crowd. Usually pretty fun shows but pretty boring albums.- The Grateful Dead, Bela Fleck & The Flecktones, Phish, Sister Hazel, The Pat McGee BandJazz: Acid Jazz; Jazz....on acid. Or with acid poured over it. I can't quite figure out which but there's definitely some form of actual acid involved and it's likely more potent than lactic or citric. Plus \"acid\" is a really cool word. Even cooler than \"house\". - Exodus Quartet; Medeski, Martin & Wood; DJ Logic, Count Basie, Quiet Boys, RadBebop; up-tempo, exemplifying instrumental mastery while not actually showing off. Lots of improvisation and elements that leant themselves eventually to the progressive rock styles; unison melodies, shrink/grow rhythm backings, solo breaks, etc. - Charlie Parker, Chet Baker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell TrioBig Band; larger than a small band. Incorporating strong brass, woodwinds and dominant percussion throughout. Typically more happy and bouncy. And big. - Squirrel Nut Zippers, Glenn Miller Orchestra, Duke Ellington, Chickenhawks, Benny GoodmanJazz Funk; more of a solid back-beat groove than other jazz styles. Makes use of synthesizers and analog tone generation. More groove than pure jazz but more jazz than pure funk. - Wynton Marsalis, Grover Washington, The Whitefield Brothers, The Woo Woos, Entourage, Joe AugustineJazz Fusion; sort of Progressive Jazz. Fuses jazz with other styles like funk, R&B, rock, etc. \"Fuse\" is a cool jazzy sounding word. Almost as cool as \"acid\". - Plunge, Soulive, Tom Scott, Weather Report, Manhattan Transfer, NiacinLatin Jazz; exactly that. Utilizes latin beats and rhythms along with multiple and various percussion-centric structures. Incorporates anything from Bolero to Rhumba but doesn't quite \"fuse\" them.....I guess....- Acoustic Alchemy, Gare Du Nord, Yutaka, Mas Mamones, Kim Pensyl, Al Di Meola, BrasiliaRagtime; socially and chronologically bridged the gap between classical and jazz. Strong syncopated rhythms and metric patterns pulled from African-American music from the early 20th Century. Primarily piano based. - Scott Joplin, Gene Austin, Ernest Hogan, Dorsey Brothers, Nora Bayes, Ted LewisSmooth Jazz; the music you listen to when you're winding down after a hard day of yoga classes and meditation. Relaxation akin to whale sounds and trickling rivers. - Yellowjackets, Kenny G, Where There's Smoke, J. Spencer, Ricky Ford, Dave KozSoft Jazz; see Smooth Jazz, but softer. Imagine winding down after a day of winding down after a day of yoga classes and...... you get the picture. - Mark Baldwin, Victor Goines, Ziggy Elfman, Eric Darken, Pat Coil, Phil WoodsTraditional Jazz; music for music's sake. The guys who originally broke the rules and continue to do so. They even broke the rules of jazz itself with their category name; since \"Traditional Jazz\" is itself oxymoronic. - Dave Brubeck, Lord Buckley, Diana Krall, Al Jolson, Elmer Bernstein, Chick WebbVocal Jazz; not all scat and beedoppadoops. The voice as an instrument. Focus on virtuosity of the voice and expression through vocal timbre and fluidity. The best ones were female. Sorry, Louis. - Nina Simone, Etta James, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Ethel Waters, Nat King ColeMetal: Avant-Garde Metal; the weird crap. The stuff that people either love or hate. Typically not as talented as the Progressive guys, but less heavy and hardcore than the pure metal guys. - System of a Down, Faith No More, Buckethead, King Crimson, Sikth, IntronautBlack Metal; similar to death metal, but slightly more atmospheric and extreme. These guys wear skull face-paint and dress like dead demons and other scary stuff. Lo-fi recordings with tremolo guitar and screeching, wailing vocals atop fast tempos/beats and low, thrumming bass. -Aurora Borealis, Behemoth, Setherial, Satanic Slaughter, Noctuary, Watain, Ethereal WoodsClassic Metal; where it all started. The first down-tuned, high-action riffs building from the oppressive industrial age in mid-century Great Britain. And the need to kick ass following all that rockabilly crap.- Scorpions, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Dio, Rainbow, Iron Butterfly, Mot\u00f6rheadDeath Metal; metal about death. Or metal that sounds like it's dying or killing. Lots of blast beats and atonalities. Fast double-bass drums and down-tuned guitars. Screaming and growling. These guys don't play too many Bar Mitzvahs.- Napalm Death, Abysmal Dawn, Mortification, Dethklok, Fleshgore, Beneath the MassacreDoom Metal; like death metal but more ominous using slower tempos and more atmospheric tones. Lyrics are typically depressing and morose and will leave you feeling like killing yourself. - Thergothon, Orodruin, The Hidden Hand, Mindrot, The Obsessed, Unholy, Witchfinder GeneralFunk Metal; relatively self-explanatory. Metal, with some funk. Or funk with a heavier vibe. Heavy crunchy; yet funky and danceable; grooves. Slap bass and wah-wah guitar often rear their heads. Tightly tuned snare drums and snappy bass drums with a lot of emphasis on the hi-hat; usually. -Infectious Grooves, Living Colour, Mordred, Primus, Fishbone, Mind FunkGlam Metal; all about glitz and glamour. Make-up, hair-spray, tight red leather pants and ripped-off blues riffs. I love it. - Poison, Whitesnake, Ratt, Def Leppard, Great White, Bon Jovi, Saigon KickGoth Metal; somewhat of a horror theme pervades this category. Often times skull makeup or zombie/vampire/werewolf themes will be prevalent. Names often include prepositions.- In This Moment, Cradle of Filth, Within Temptation, Motionless In White, Theatre of Tragedy, AgathodaimonIndustrial Metal; more digital sound than raw analog metal. Sometimes just one or two guys doing it all. Can become over-commercialized due to it's attainability by the masses. - Rob Zombie, Front Line Assembly, God Lives Underwater, Skinny Puppy, NIN, Filter, The Union UndergroundJazz Metal; metal with an air of pretense. Not as esoteric as Avant-Garde Metal and more artsy than Funk Metal. Elements of Jazz like improvisation and off-kilter chord structures prevail. -Conflux, Gru, Sithu Aye, Shining, Naked CityMetalcore; growling, screaming and yelling. Angry people reside here; somewhere between extreme metal and hardcore punk. Hey wait.....Metalpunk? no....Extrard? no.....Punkstreme? no. Metalcore! There. That works. - SOiL, Drowning Pool, Biohazard, The Agonist, Trivium, HelmetNeoclassical Metal; these guys would be composing for their respective local monarchs had they lived 200 years ago. This is metal with classical tendencies, but not necessarily classical instrumentation. Mostly guitar virtuosos hang out here. Their bands are typically comprised of musical over-achievers who son\u2019t quite have what it takes to be fully progressive. -Yngwie Malmsteen, Vinnie Moore, Timmo Tolkki, Joshua Perahia, Marty FriedmanNu Metal; guys who use digital production techniques and a more refined sound. Good hardcore stuff, but not raw and dirty. Often have numbers in their names.- Korn, 10 Years, 3 Days Grace, 30 Seconds To Mars, Breaking Benjamin, Shinedown, Sevendust, Finger ElevenPower Metal; metal that combines the powerful elements of classic metal, speed metal and a bit of symphonic metal for added drama. These guys are in your face but not in a Death/Doom/Black Metal way. There\u2019s more life and less death here. Not always happy, but driven and motivational. -Alestorm, Powerwolf, Metal Church, Iced Earth, Kamelot, HelloweenProgressive Metal; - Heavy, yet classical virtuosity runs rampant. Complex orchestrations and thematic derivatives abound. Their album covers are usually pretty Dungeons & Dragons-esque.-Dream Theater, Symphony X, Nevermore, Shadow Gallery, Tool, Pain of Salvation, Iced EarthRap Metal; Pretty self-explanatory. Combines rap and metal. - Linkin Park, P.O.D., Kid Rock, Rage Against The Machine, Papa Roach, Crazy Town, Limp BizkitSleaze Metal; akin to Glam Metal, but with more grime. More about sex and drugs in the deviant and slimy way. Not really about partying, but about the actual sex and drugs. More leather and fringe than hairspray and makeup. Though you will find some makeup. -Billy Idol, Guns \u2019n\u2019 Roses, Skid Row, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fceSludge Metal; usually has a somewhat dirtier, grimier feel to it. Slower deep-tuned crunchy riffs and distortion. Sometimes screaming and growling mixed with somewhat southern rock feeling styles. Themes include pessimism, hopelessness, anger. - Black Label Society, Rollins Band, Mastodon, Corrosion of Conformity, Haste, Soilent Green, EyehategodSpeed Metal; exactly that. Speed. Even the band names are so fast they only use one word. - Helloween, Overkill, Impellitteri, Cranium, Atomkraft, Annihilator, Sodom, Kreator, GravediggerSymphonic Metal; - again, pretty self-explanatory. Metal guys don't like to waste time with esoteric nomenclature like \"Trip Hop\" or \"Bluegrass\". - After Forever, Dimmu Borgir, Blind Guardian, Nightwish, Seraphim, Interfector, AyreonThrash Metal; the guys you likely know best. The original Bay-Area metalheads themselves.- Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Sepultura, Pantera, Slayer, Metal Church, Exodus, TestamentViking Metal; metal having to do with Vikings (mostly lyrically.); whom are likely the most \"metal\" culture in the history of the world. - Mortiis, Heidevolk, Hel, Turisas, Wolfchant, Grand Magus, BorknagarOrchestral: Broadway; the music that's played during those plays on Broadway in NYC. - Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera, Miss Saigon, Jesus Christ SuperstarClassical; the dominant Western music from 1750 to 1830. - (composers) Antonin Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Claude Debussy, Franz Schubert, Hector Berlioz, Ludwig Van Beethoven, Wolfgang Mozart, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin- (performers) Yo-Yo Ma, Mike Wollenberg, Lang Lang, Andre Rieu, The London Philharmonic, Woody PhillipsMovie Scores; the music that's played during those movies you watch sometimes. Either in NYC or elsewhere.- Alan Silvestri (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump); Danny Elfman (Batman, Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure); James Horner (Titanic, Braveheart); John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jaws, Jurassic Park, Superman); Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, The Rock); Harold Faltermeyer (Beverly Hills Cop, Fletch, Top Gun)New Age; the music you listen to during your hard day of yoga classes and meditation.- Andreas Wollenweider, Jordan Rudess, Turin Brakes, Yanni, Gordon HemptonVocal; the vocal instrument applied to the rigors of Classical instrumentation- Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban, Sarah Brightman, Luciano Pavarotti, Il Divo, Brooklyn Tabernacle ChoirPop: Adult Contemporary; a fancy name for the lame music your parents probably listened to. Mostly maudlin tunes about the lives and thoughts of privileged, white, middle-aged hipsters. - Anne Murray, Barry Manilow, Wilson Phillips, Neil Diamond, Carly SimonBeat Pop; the British invasion of back-beat driven pop icons of the late 50s and early 60s. Most bands are \"The\" something. - The Beatles, The Lovin' Spoonful, The Kingsmen, The Turtles, The Byrds, The Cuff Links, The Hollies, The Newbeats, The Left Banke, The Zombies, Gunhill RoadDance Pop; the popular music to dance to. Not as counter-culture as EDM, but slightly heavier than Bubble Gum Pop; which I didn't list as a category. - Bananarama, Billy Ocean, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Debbie Gibson, EMF, Will to Power, TiffanyDisco; formed from funk, psychedelic and soul; this style rebelled against the rock music of the day in a more visceral, primal way. All about body movement, dancing and the human spectacle, it stole colorful clothing and drugs from the Hippies, up-beat driven rhythms from the Beatniks and combined them in a sexy, seductive libido-based production praising dance and expressive human life. It is currently \"dead\". - ABBA, The Bee Gees, The Village People, KC & The Sunshine Band, Gloria Gaynor, Lipps Inc.Doo Wop; yet another mainstream derivative of African-American music, doo wop uses more nonsensical phrases and sounds to emphasize harmony and melody over lyrical substance. These names also are often \"The\" something. - The Dominoes, The Platters, The Tune-Weavers, The Casinos, The Dreamlovers, The Passions, The Penguins, The Rivieras, The Esquires, Bob & Earl.Indie Pop; somewhat contradictory, the emphasis on self-reliance and the whole DIY perspective is exploited to assure popularity and mainstream success. But somehow it works.- The Ting Tings, Fine Young Cannibals, Nil Lara, Karry Walker, Sundays, Hang UpsLatin Pop; exactly that. Pop with better beats and more complex rhythms that actually force you to dance even if you are unwilling. - Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias, Pit Bull, Shakira, Miami Sound Machine, Lou BegaPop Rock; slightly edgier pop. Or slightly more commercialized rock. Take your pick.- Fiona Apple, Jewel, Avril Lavigne, Natalie Imbruglia, Eric Carmen, Maroon 5Power Pop; high production music for the sake of performance.- Journey, Rick Springfield, Survivor, Duran Duran, Huey Lewis & The News, Go-Gos, Cutting Crew, The B52sSurf Pop; the music you listen to while watching people surf. Somehow this style became separate from other closely related similar styles and is audibly evident in every group it houses.- The Ventures, The Beach Boys, The Surfaris, Jan and Dean, The Rip-Chords, Dick DaleSynthpop; like power pop, but with the emphasis on synthesizers. - Tears For Fears, OMD, Herbie Hancock, When In Rome, Falco, Dead or Alive, Thomas DolbyTraditional Pop; the crooners. The original pop vocalists whose reputations continue to dazzle and impress. The Rat Pack. The Vegas Lounge Lizards. No, those aren't band names.- Perry Como, Wayne Newton, Tom Jones, Bobby Vinton, Frank Sinatra, Mel TormeR&B: Alternative Hip Hop; Hip Hop that doesn't quite fit the mold of standard R&B. Somewhat left of center and progressive by R&B standards.- Outkast, Black Eyed Peas, Jurassic 5, Wu-Tang Clan, Jadakiss, N.E.R.D., Insane Clown PosseFunk; emphasis on rhythm and groove rather than melody and harmony. Chords aren't as important as the bass line underneath them or the drum beat behind them. - The Brothers Johnson, Commodores, Kool & The Gang, George Clinton & the P-Funk All Stars, Curtis MayfieldNeo Soul; Soul, but newer. Neo is just a cool word for \"new\". Though not as cool as \"acid\". OOH!!! Acid Soul! Is that a genre?! If it isn't then it should be. - Jamiroquai, Amy Winehouse, Beyonce, Bruno Mars, Christina Aguilera, Terence Trent d'ArbyNew Jack Swing; \"Neo Jack Swing\" would sound pretentious and the R&B genre is anything but pretentious. And \"Acid Jack Swing\" would sound like drug or sex slang. These guys combined Urban Contemporary beats and Dance Pop composition to create a very catchy sound that showcased a lot of soulful melodies and harmonies. This was \"The bomb\" in the late '80s and early '90s. - Boyz II Men, Bel Biv DeVoe, En Vogue, DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, New Edition, Kid 'n' Play, MC Hammer, Paula AbdulRap; talking. mostly. Though talking very well and rhyming with complex rhythms and rhyme schemes on top of looped beats and melody lines. - Eminem, Cypress Hill, Timbaland, Snoop Dogg, Grandmaster Flash, Digital Underground, Ludacris, Beastie BoysSoul; the s%*t that makes you wanna f%*k. - Teddy Pendergrass, The Righteous Brothers, Lionel Richie, Aaron Neville, Hall & Oates, Luther Vandross, John LegendUrban Contemporary; a combination of EDM, Reggae, Dance Pop, Soul and Rap that creates a very broad range of styles and expressions. - Usher, Nikki Minaj, Justin Timberlake, Missy Elliott, Trey Songz, Rihanna, Ne-Yo, Flo-Rida, DrakeReggae: Dancehall; Jamaican pop that strips down Reggae to the most crucial dance vibes necessary, though it added more digital instrumentation and faster rhythms.- Leonard Dillon, Toots Hibbert, Wailing Souls, Ebony Steelband, Aswad, Big MountainDub; mostly instrumental remixes of existing Reggae recordings.- Third World, Black Uhuru, Yellowman, Sly & Robbie, Freddie McGregorRagga; primarily electronic Reggae. Slower and more laid back than Dancehall, but more produced and digitized than Roots.- Steel Pulse, Trinidad Steel Drum Band, Inner Circle, Desmond Williams, Lasana Bandel\u00e9, Joe HiggsRoots; spiritual Rastafarian expression of life and experiences. Primal, raw and unmistakably catchy.- Bob Marley & The Wailers, Greyhound, Dhaima, Crucial Vibes, Kojak & Liza, Shorty the PresidentRock: Alternative; not quite squeezed into the \"Rock\" definition, but not quite squeezed out of it either. - Soul Asylum, U2, The Wallflowers, Jesus Jones, Beck, Toad the Wet SprocketAmericana; the music about the working class. The hopes and dreams of the free American people. Driving rock that you can hear in bars and stadiums alike.- Bruce Springsteen, Bryan Adams, The Traveling Wilburys, John Mellencamp, Tom Petty, John FogertyArt Rock; slightly skewed but still rock. More experimental and \"out there\". Costumes are common. As is make-up and characterization. - David Bowie, Peter Gabriel, David Byrne, Velvet Underground, Radiohead, Incubus, Talking HeadsClassic Rock; the original rockers. If you haven't heard of these guys you haven't heard of Rock. - Led Zeppelin, The Who, Steve Miller Band, Queen, Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, The TroggsCollege Rock; rock for the sake of getting laid in college. These guys pandered to the more sensitive female audience, thereby creating the necessity for the male audience to like them as well. Typically pretty stupid and nonsensical sounding names.- Vertical Horizon, Iffy, Counting Crows, Hoobastank, Goo Goo Dolls, Fastball, Dishwalla, Hootie & The Blowfish, Matchbox 20, Emmet SwimmingDark Wave; slightly more despondent and depressed. More morose and well......dark. - The Church, The Cure, Blue October, Depeche Mode, The Stone Roses, Joy DivisionFunk Rock; pretty self-explanatory.- Primus, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Spin Doctors, 311, Mother's Finest, Tina & The B-side MovementGrunge; these guys killed Glam Metal. But it was already beginning to show signs of weakness. <sigh accompanied by single tear> This music stripped away all image and pretense and left us with guys who were just good enough at their instrument to still allow every high-school boy in America to be able to play along...... to all their pretty songs......and shoot his gun. - Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Garbage, L7, Mudhoney, Stone Temple Pilots, Local H, Love Battery, The MelvinsHard Rock; not Classic. But not Soft. Or Grungy. Just hard. Though not as hard as Metal. So maybe really hard wood or stone. Yeah that's it. Hard Rock.- Velvet Revolver, Audioslave, Midnight Oil, Pat Benatar, Billy Squier, Drivin' 'N' Cryin', LoverboyIndie Rock; rock that does it's own thing despite what the industry tells it to do.- R.E.M., Florence + The Machine, Monks Of Doom, The Connells, Cake, Juliette & The Licks, They Might Be GiantsNew Wave; more frenetic and impulsive than former rock, disco and punk. More guitar licks and rhythms that didn't just sit you down and leave you there. Somewhat electronic and experimental. Some might say, \"new\". - INXS, The Police, Crowded House, Spandau Ballet, Oingo Boingo, Shiny Toy Guns, Corey HartPost-Grunge; came after grunge, and was slightly more produced than grunge, but still held on to some of that Grunge angst that made it so successful.- Stone Sour, Ugly Kid Joe, Hinder, Collective Soul, Nickelback, Flyleaf, Candlebox, GodsmackProgressive Rock; the overly talented musicians that only cater to other musicians. Everyone in the crowd is male, plays an instrument, and knows every musical nuance of every song by heart.- Bozzio, Levin, Stevens; Rush; Meatloaf; Styx; Frank Zappa; Mullmuzzler; Genesis; Kansas; Umphrey's McGeePsychedelic Rock; quirky, drugged out hysterical nonsense rock with a lot of outward expression against normalcy. Fun shows that led to a lot of deaths; by drug and alcohol consumption; and pregnancies......by drug and alcohol consumption. - Big Brother & The Holding Company, The Doors, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Moody Blues, Sopwith Camel, Vanilla Fudge, DonovanPunk; the rebels who hated society and weren't afraid to let it be known. They'd bleed on stage, rip off their clothes and surf the crowd naked, dump buckets of sweat and other bodily fluids on the crowd while screaming and railing against authority and tradition. Oh and they sometimes held instruments too.- Sex Pistols, Bad Religion, Ramones, Iggy & The Stooges, The Clash, American Hi-FiRockabilly; what some call the original Rock & Roll. A combination of hillbilly and rock containing a western swing and a bouncing party vibe. With elements of piano-based Jump Blues and electric boogie woogie, it made it's mark on the music scene indelibly. Almost everyone's named contained a \"Y\". - Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Tommy Sands, Johnny Rivers, Jerry Lee Lewis, Freddy Cannon, Chubby Checker, Little RichardSka; rock with horns. This provided all those high school kids who chose to play brass in the school band a way to be cool... For about 18 months in the late '90s. - No Doubt, Fighting Gravity, Dispatch, Blue Meanies, Toots & The Maytals, Jack FridaySoft Rock; the rock you listen to on the radio when driving to your yoga or meditation class. - Traffic, Glenn Frey, Linda Ronstadt, Don Henley, Kim Carnes, Gerry RaffertySouthern Rock; rock from the south. Lots of twang and rough gravelly vocals mixed with two-step rhythms that keep audiences head-bobbin' and wavin' confederate flags.

And please don't be offended if I've misplaced something that you feel should go elsewhere; in all the previous categories or in the following geographic generalizations. These are mostly all regional folk or traditional music of general locations named accordingly, and just those that I am familiar with and like. I know full well that many and various styles and cultures exist within the overall regions I\u2019ve specified here.)
