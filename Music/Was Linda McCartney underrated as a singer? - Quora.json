            "answer_text": "Underrated or overrated? Not applicable. For Linda McCartney was not a professional singer and IMO should not be subjected to rating as a singer.  Whenever somebody criticized her singing, that she was out of tune, she\u2019d be the first to say THAT\u2019S TRUE! Then why was she on stage performing? Because Paul McCartney wanted her to accompany him. When The Beatles broke up, Paul fell into deep depression. He would spend days in bed and drink excessively, wondering what to do with his life. Linda pulled him out of that emotional crisis by praising his work as a songwriter and by persuading him to go back and do what he liked doing most - performing on stage. Paul would follow her advice if she would be up there with him. But she was not a musician, she was a photographer. No problem. Paul taught her how to play the keyboard and he formed a group called Wings with her as member. And so Linda, an amateur musician, went up on stage to perform with her husband who was/is one of the best musicians in the history of music. And unfortunately, though predictably, she had to endure a lot of criticisms. Paul was quick to defend her: \u201cWe like having Linda in the group. She is a great influence on us. She\u2019s no Billy Preston, but I would not like a very technical keyboard player, because they tend to take over. Linda isn\u2019t a pro, but if people don\u2019t like it, they shouldn\u2019t come next time. I couldn\u2019t care less. We love her playing with Wings.\u201d And the rest as they say is history. Paul was able to overcome his depression and went on to have a very, very successful post-Beatles career that is still going on strong today, long after Linda had passed away. In hindsight, Linda went up on stage to perform her duty not primarily as a singer but as a wife supporting her husband. And so it is as a WIFE that she should be given a rating and at that, I sincerely believe, she was UNDERRATED. Thank you. ",
