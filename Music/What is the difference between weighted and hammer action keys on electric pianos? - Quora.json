            "answer_text": "I am not a piano technician, but I do have a keyboard with \u201cweighted\u201d keys; a Yamaha P90 with \u201cgraded hammer effect\u201d; and I have an excellent Mason & Hamlin grand piano. In the past, I did have a couple upright pianos. For me, the grand piano action is the most responsive. It makes it easier to modulate from soft to loud expression than the keyboard. I find that some upright pianos have a better keyboard action than others, with the best ones being close to that of a decent grand piano. In my experience among pianos in good condition, is that most grand pianos have a more pleasant action than most uprights, but there are upright pianos with very nice actions. I think the difference is due to the way gravity affects the horizontal hammers in the grand versus the vertical hammers in the upright. My P90 key action is weighted to simulate the touch of an acoustic piano, and it is MUCH better than a keyboard with unweighted action. However, there is something about the momentum of the hammers and the more complex action mechanism in an acoustic piano that seems to put another dimension of expression in reach of the pianist. There are some (more expensive) keyboards that actually include a hammer action mechanism to more closely simulate the touch of an acoustic piano. I was under the impression that my P90 action was a little bit lighter than that of my Mason & Hamlin, but when my piano technician was tuning my grand piano, I asked him about it. He had special weights to test the weight of the key action, and I was amazed to discover that the action \u201ckey weight\u201d on my grand piano was actually lighter than that of the P90! What I was feeling as additional \u201cweight\u201d when playing the grand was the effect of the momentum within the complex hammer mechanism of the grand. For me the effect of this complexity is a good thing. ",

            "answer_text": "These days the two terms are often used synonymously, although it is incorrect to do so. You basically have four varieties of keyboard action available today: non-weighted, semi-weighted, weighted and hammer-action. There is even one more type of action which is essentially the hammer action designed to simulate the heavier weight that the keys on a full-size acoustic piano have on the left side, versus the lighter keys you would feel to the right. Those who grew up tinkering with synthesizer keyboards, MIDI controllers and various other electronic keyboards are more than likely going to prefer the weighted and semi-weighted keyboards, whereas those who learned on traditional acoustic or \u2018digital\u2019 pianos that possess hammer-action characteristics will likely enjoy continuing to use the hammer-action variety. Although \u2018weighted\u2019 and \u2018hammer-action\u2019 are often used synonymously, they really represent two different applications of techniques to add tactile feel and resistance. To add even more to the confusion, terms like \u2018keyboard, keyboard-controller, midi controller, synthesizer and digital piano are often used interchangeably, and although they all perform many of the same functions, they often possess different focuses. But that's a topic for another day. :) ",
