            "answer_text": "I guess what your really asking is how little equipment you need to record something that sounds good? Because ultimately, that's really the only question anyone has. Minus all the bells and whistles, all you truly need are 3 main components. Computer Recording Device Playback Device Obviously, you'll need the specific cables for each, but that's really it. So the computer is your main interface. Most people already have a computer/laptop, and a majority of current CPUs can handle music production software, so I won't talk about this. Just get a DAW (the most popular are in the the $300\u2013$400 range, however, upgrades and expansions can very easily cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, but that's for advanced stuff). I prefer Reason for my DAW, but Ableton Live and Logic are all industry-leading DAWs which can record and produce any type of music you can think of, so look at these for your best and cheapest options (Apple's Logic is only $200, so if you have a Mac, it's likely a good choice). The recording device is key. Get a mic that has a USB connection. I use the zune H4N (about $200-$300), it's USB bussed, has up to 32 bit recording, phantom power, etc\u2026and best of all it's built for mobility (its not much bigger than a basic handheld microphone, It has many features, but it's a great solution for high quality recordings, regardless of where you go. This particular mic also fits in a hotshoe on top of a DSLR camera, so it's great for multimedia production, so you can use it for many types of media projects, maximizing your value). Finally, your gonna need a way to monitor your playback. Studio pros rely on a mixture of high end speakers and headphones, well insulated recording spaces and more equipment than you can dream of, but that's not us. Ultimately, you will need either a good set of studio monitors (speakers), or \u201ccans\u201d (headphones). If you are serious about recording while saving every penny, I would argue that some moderately expensive (in the $200 range) cans will get you thru with decent results for your recordings, even if you don't have good speakers. Since you can do a few more key things with headphones than you can with speakers, \u201ccans\u201d win the draw. Now, keep in mind that I've answered this question with the novice, beginner in mind. The setup that I've discussed is very, very limited, but it's the bare minimum. If I were working this setup, it would literally be for recording basic things, such as vocals and light sampling. Sure you could make full songs within your DAW and add your vocals/samples, and get great results depending on your engineering and production skills. But this is mainly for idea/concept/lightweight production means. The rest of the production should be shipped to more robust studios for the proper treatments, mastering and other things. All in all, you can build from this starting point. Obviously, your needs will change as you progress, but these 3 things are the backbone of all studio setups. The great part is, you can use this for all types of multimedia projects besides simply music. Vlogs, podcasts, radio broadcasting, commercials, whatever you need, all this equipment will end up paying for itself as it helps you expand your project scope, increasing your opportunities to produce audio content. Happy Producing! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by just record. Record what? Just you singing. You and a guitar? A whole band semi-professionally? I started out with that question in the 80's. Sold my first car for a tascam porta one cassette 4 track. It sounded way better than using a boom box but compared to today it's silly. In the two thousand oh ohs I got a tascam dp01fx. 8 channels of digital mixing. Much better sound but dealing with signals in the box was cumbersome and if you wanted to transfer files to a computer or was difficult. As convienent as a portastuduo seems, its really not and since I went to an interface, computer, and daw, I won't go back. For just you singing or singing and guitar at the same time to show your friends\u2026 get a zoom (not zune) h1 or h1n. Its a digital recorder (in stereo) with good mics, really tiny, and easy to use for around $100 - 120. There you go. You can stop reading now. Later, you can use it as a usb mic or use the aux output for an xy small condenser mic. I still used mine as a drum overhead or to record my whole bands live performances so it's money well spent. If you want something more feature packed and multichannel, go for the h4n pro (no it's not a strain of the flu). It costs more but does more and has slightly better mics and you can plug a couple other mics or lines into it at the same time maybe to capture the live band sound and the board mix at the same time to blend them later. Or, possibly drum overheads, snare, and kick all at once. So for a computer setup, get a 4 core processor minimum. It could be a used core quad from 2009 but for avoiding skips during the recording process, a quad core is really a step up from a dual core even with multi threading which you will curse from time to time. No atom processors because they throttle all the time and screw your music up royally. Obviously, the more power you have, the more you can do. Daws\u2026 cheap and FULL FEATURED is the order of the day for a budget. My recommendation is either reaper at $60 (3 month full featured free trial that you can still use after the 3 months with nags but still full featured). It's uses little computer resources and is becoming very popular. Then there is cakewalk. I don't think you can get better than these for free. They are only limited by your computer's power not how much you spend. There are many great free plugins to supplement them if you research to make up for the plugins the more expensive daws give you. You can make a radio ready song on these if you have the talent not like the old days. In addition to that zoom small condenser Mic you got first, you probably will want a large diaphragm condenser (I recommend an at2020 or 2035) and a decent dynamic microphone (shure sm57 to start out). These will now cover your bases for capturing different types of sounds and feels. If you want to record a drum kit, you can watch some youtube videos on minimal micing or get a drum Mike kit like the samson dk-05 or 7. Good bang for the buck set to get you started. Then you need an audio interface. This gets your music into the computer. If your a one or two man band and record one instrument at a time and you already got that h4n mentioned above, your already good to go. (Products with multiple uses are the best bang for your buck). Otherwise there are many two channel interfaces available. Get at least two channels not one because someday you may want to record something in stereo. Get the best built in preamps you can. If you record a whole band at the same time, you need more channels and a computer that can handle that. As a singer\u2026 here is the problem with recording this way. Usually there is latancy (a delay) when you are trying to hear yourself through a computer and at least it's annoying and at worst will mess up your timing so bad you screw up your take. There are interfaces that advertise zero latency monitoring but most of them don't have built in reverb so if you want that, you still have to go through the computer daw and your latency is back. Here is my recommendation. I have a behringer x18 which is a full blown 18 channel mixer you can use for a live mixing session like a band gig or use as a recording interface (multiple uses again). Being a mixer, it has all sorts of effects you can use for live monitoring at zero latency and you can record a whole band at once. I think there are a few different things on the market that will do this now but I know the Behringer works well (don't get the lower behringer models, they don't work this way). Then you need some speakers and headphones to mix your music on. Quality is up to you but I recommend on top of a nice \u201cflat\u201d monitor or headphone, go to a thrift store and buy a range of speakers for cheap so you can hear what it sounds like on different speakers and if you can make it sound reasonably nice on all of them, you should be good to go. Best of luck. ",
