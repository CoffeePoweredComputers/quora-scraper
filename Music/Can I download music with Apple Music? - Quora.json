            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if you want to download it while still subscribed to Apple Music, or if you want to keep the music even when the subscription ends. If it\u2019s the latter, then you should probably refer to Clyde Lee\u2019s answer (although I don\u2019t know how legal it is). If you want to download the music so you can listen to it offline while subscribed to Apple Music you can find all the information on this page on the Apple Website. I\u2019ll copy the important section here: How to download music to listen to offline You can download songs, albums, or playlists to your device so that you can listen to them when you're not connected to the Internet.* You must download songs, albums, or playlists on each device that you want to use for offline listening. Before you can download music to listen to offline, you need to add the songs, albums, or playlists to your Library. After you add the music to your Library, in the Music app on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, or in iTunes on your Mac or PC, find the song, album, or playlist that you want to download. Then: On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch: Tap Download. On your Mac or PC: Click Download . You'll see  when the download is complete. If you have Automatic Downloads turned on, music automatically downloads to your device or computer when you add it to your Library. You won't see  or  *You can download music on up to 10 devices. These songs are accessible only during your Apple Music membership. I hope my answer helped! ",

            "answer_text": "No. Apple Music only \u201csaves\u201d music, rather than downloading it, as this is DRM-protected. If you want to download music from Apple Music, download it using the iTunes Store since songs from Apple Music is also there, with prices ranging from $0.35 to $1.69 depending on the song. EDIT: Another reason why I suggested to download Apple Music songs thru the iTunes Store is that it is DRM-free, so you can transfer the songs to another device, whether an iOS or Android. In Apple Music, you can transfer, but you cannot play the song due to its DRM-protected status. ",

From the song list, you can find an icon like cloud download and just click it  However this is only worked when you still play them via your Apple Music app or other, you can\u2019t transfer and copy these \u201cdownloaded\u201d Apple Music files to other devices and so on.
