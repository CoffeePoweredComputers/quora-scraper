            "answer_text": "If you are already asleep then it is not necessary that the subconscious is focused on what you are listening. The better way to program your subconscious mind is just before you go to sleep at night. At this time your brainwaves slow to alpha and theta, and this helps to bypass your conscious mind. So people can program their subconscious mind just before they went to sleep... ...and even program their subconscious mind to generate the dreams they wish... This message must be repeated over and over as you go to sleep.........either mentally or softly to yourself. This can sometimes be quite hard to do as you may drift off half way through your self-programming. It is best to record this message over and over and play it as you fall asleep. (If you're not sure how to create this audio for yourself, we have created a special audio using a script based on our research) You must be \"willing\" to absorb new knowledge. You must \"open your mind\" to new ideas. You must \"imagine\". You must \"visualize\" that the knowledge is \"flowing into you\". Visualize yourself on a large screen. You can now see yourself on a large screen, see the screen surrounded in white. See all your dreams, all your goals on this screen. See yourself wealthy, slim or with a partner. Whatever your plans, whatever your desires: see them on the screen. What can you see? What can you smell? What can you hear? What colours do you see? The more you practise this visualization, the sooner it will become reality. The power of visualization is very real - THOUGHTS are stronger than words.** If, at first you are having difficulty visualizing believe you can and you will.

            "answer_text": "Is there benefit to listening to hypnotic suggestions during deep sleep? For the vast, vast majority of people the answer is a clear, \u201cNo.\u201d Hypnotic suggestion, in general, is only marginally effective. Here, what I mean by hypnotic suggestion is the classic portrayal of hypnosis, \u201cYou no longer desire chocolate cake. Chocolate cake is disgusting to you\u2026\u201d It can work for some people, but usually its effects are short lived. To effectively work with the subconscious we need to understand how the subconscious forms beliefs and desires which manifest in your conscious life. Essentially for the subconscious to form such a belief it requires 1) an idea, and 2) an emotional response. The stronger the emotion, the stronger the subconscious belief. I like to use an example of cement. Imagine, if you will, three red plastic cups. Each is filled halfway with gray powdery cement mix. To the first cup we add an equal portion of water. We stir it up until it is a wet grey sludge and let it sit. To the second cup we add only 1/4 as much water. Similarly we stir it up until we have a slightly damp mix and then let it sit. To the third cup we add nothing. The cement powder here represents an idea. Maybe it\u2019s the idea that you deserve to be happy in your romantic relationships. And the water represents emotion. Returning a day later we find that the first cup has hardened into a solid, dense, and strong block of cement. It would take significant effort to break it apart. The second cup has formed a solid mass, but with some small effort it will crumble in our hands. The third cup remains a powder and can be dispersed with nothing more than a strong breath. This is analogous to how the subconscious forms and stores beliefs. The more emotion, the stronger and more permanent the subconscious belief. How does this relate to hypnotic suggestion? Well, in general, a hypnotic suggestion has little to no emotion associated with it. This is why, even for the small percentage of people who are affected by suggestion, the effects quickly crumble. To have a true impact on the subconscious one cannot passively listen to hypnosis recordings. They just don\u2019t work. Instead you must ACTIVELY participate by using your imagination to form complex and powerful associations with strong emotional responses. When you work with a skilled hypnotherapist you will receive very little (if any at all) traditional hypnotic suggestion. Instead, the hypnotherapist will guide you to use your imagination to create an idea, then attach an emotional response to that idea. It\u2019s a process, because everyone\u2019s imagination is different and everyone\u2019s emotional responses are different. But, once the hypnotherapist zero\u2019s in on what works for you, progress is usually quick. I hope this his helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "I have not read any research so far to support this idea.  In fairness, I have not researched it extensively.  You will, almost certainly, read claims from people who say it works, but I would encourage you to to ask for documentation when they make those claims. In Dave Elman's book, \"Hypnotherapy,\" he writes about a technique of using hypnosis to transition people to sleep, and keep some connection to the hypnotic operator in this \"hypnosis attached to sleep.\" He claimed it was very powerful and would not write about the details because of his fear it would be misused.  I've always wondered what he really had done with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, your hearing is intact. Your conscious mind (grey matter) is sleeping. But your brain stem is awake and working. It processes the information from the hypnotherapy tape and makes you relaxed while you sleep. It will remember everything on a subconscious level. Your creative part will be stimulated to come up with solutions to your life problems that you would otherwise never have thought of. All of that information will gradually come to you during the following day when you are fully awake. What responds to hypnotherapy are anxiety, insomnia, even bad habits that may be otherwise difficult to shed.  ",
