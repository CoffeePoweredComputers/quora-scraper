            "answer_text": "Most of Paul Simon's song are intensely personal, yet he manages to write lyrics in such a way that they don't come across mawkish or self-pitying.  For instance, The Boxer was written at a time when Simon was feeling particularly beaten up by the music business. In The Sound of Silence he was expressing his angst toward his, and other's, feelings of alienation in a post-modern world.  Part of this alienation is viewed as a result of our inability to communicate effectively with one another, combined with our ready acceptance of thought and opinion as provided by the mass media.  He also alludes that this is a result of our desire for, edging on addiction of, comfort as a result of our own affluence.   He uses an almost biblical suggestion in the passage, And in the naked light I saw ten thousand people maybe more. This is a suggestion he will use again, to great effect.  He goes on the reveal what he believes is our inability, or unwillingness to communicate with one another, saying, People talking without speaking. People hearing without listening.  People writing songs that voices never shared. He also observes the populous, in general, is unwilling to take a stand against this norm.  A sort of \"don't rock the boat\" mentality, saying, No one dared disturb the sound of silence. He writes from the point of view of an observer who sees what is going on, and yet is equally unable to express his views in such a way that is of any effect. \"Fools!\", said I.  \"Do you not know silence like a cancer grows.  Hear my words so I might teach you. Take my arms so might reach  you.\"  but my words like silent raindrops fell. He then affixes the blame for the way thing are.  What I find to be the most striking part of the song is the fact that rather than pointing at an outside force, he places the blame the this dilemma squarely on our shoulders. And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made.   Again, using a biblical suggestions to convey feeling of dread.  The narrator then warns us that this situation, left unaltered, will lead to our destruction.  And the sign flashed it's warning in the words that it was forming.  There are shades of Dickens' A Christmas Carol here, in which the ghost of Christmas future reveals to Scrooge the eventual path of his actions.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, he alludes that this situation may have resulted from our own affluence, saying, And the sign said, \"The words of the prophets are written on the subway wall and tenement halls.\" Keep in mind, this was written at a time when there was a great disillusionment in our society, and dissatisfaction with the status quo.    Those who were clinging onto the values of the 1950s were out of step, yet still a formidable force in government.   We were involved in an ever escalating war, with no clear objectives, allied to a government that was as evil as the ones or father's had fought against.   President Kennedy was recently assassinated, leaving many of the new generation to whom the torch had been passed feeling disenfranchised. It wouldn't be long before an entire generation was ready to reject their parent's middle class values. ",
