            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s see. I\u2019ll answer from a local\u2019s POV, an expat\u2019s experience might be vastly different. So anyway, most Russians are born in state-owned maternity clinics. Childbirth assistance is free. CS is available, epidural anesthesia as well. However, everything past what\u2019s necessary, including epidural anesthesia unless deemed unavoidable by the doctor, is paid for from the patient\u2019s pocket (anesthesia costs some 5k RUB, that is, some 100 USD). Infant mortality rate is 6.8 per 1000 life births, down from 20.3 in 2000 (it\u2019s 3.4 in Germany, 39.1 in India, for comparison). Maternity hospital is where a Russian gets his first vaccinations. Later on, he receives additional vaccines throughout school, when conscripted (if necessary), and at workplace (if profession demands). The parents do have a right to refuse their child\u2019s vaccination, but it\u2019s somewhat frowned upon: problems might arise for the kid when applying for kindergarten and school, and while legally that application cannot be denied, it\u2019s going to cost the parents some nerves. The vast majority of male Russians aren\u2019t circumcised, unless religious Jews or Muslims, or suffering phimosis. Female circumcision is considered mutilation and is, as such, a felony. A Russian receives her first documents shortly after birth, and it\u2019s a birth certificate. Maternity leaves are mandated by the Russian law: the first year and a half is paid leave, a year and a half after that is unpaid, but with workplace kept for the mother. The employer pays the mother her wage, but no more than some 50k RUB [~1k USD] monthly; the state compensates the expense through tax deductions. There are also multiple social support payments for parents, low-income families, etc. The most significant of those is the maternity capital introduced in 2009; it\u2019s some 450k RUB (9k USD) for each child after the first. Families with more than two children enjoy some additional social benefits. Normally, a Russian stays with her mother for her first year and a half, after that, she goes to a kindergarten. Some parents instead use the unpaid part of maternity leave, which means their children only go to the kindergarten at age 3; and some don\u2019t send their children there at all. The kindergarten costs about 2500 RUB (50 USD) monthly. The state provides medicine for all citizens since birth. Supposedly, it\u2019s free, but in fact the mandatory insurance doesn\u2019t quite cover every eventuality. All niceties like a personal room at the hospital, additional painkillers past what\u2019s necessary, skipping the queue for a surgery, etc - are paid for. Drugs are also normally paid, unless covered by social benefits for the elderly, the disabled, or the very poor. Medicine varies in quality across the nation, naturally, with the best hospitals gravitating towards larger settlements and, of course, the capital. The state medical system is supplemented by commercial clinics. Russia is somewhat of a destination for medical tourism, especially for dental work and cosmetic surgery, although it is not nearly as popular as Germany or Israel in that regard. At age seven Russian children enter school (it\u2019s actually possible and quite common to enroll a bit earlier, at six or even less). Attending school is generally mandatory; homeschooling is possible through individual agreement with the school, and normally still demands a couple days of weekly attendance. Local state (public) schools are free to attend, and enrollment is guaranteed, however, looking for an alternative better school than what you have in your neighborhood often demands passing entrance exams. There are private schools, those demand tuition, naturally. Additionally, various specialized school types exist, such as board schools for the children of Siberian nomadic deer herders, cadet schools, correction schools for junior convicts, specialized schools for the disabled, and samesuch. Classes are held five or six days a week, normally about four to six lessons a day. A lesson is about 45 minutes, followed by a 15 minute break. The core subjects are the same for everyone, ranging from chorus singing to math and from arts to world history; however, as she progresses through school, a Russian might choose specialization: it isn\u2019t possible to pick individual subjects to study, normally, but general direction is chosen, with related subjects receiving additional attention. Specializations include things like economics, maths, biology, etc; if the school has a contract with a university, profs from the uni can teach additional classes in the chosen specialization. Minimal education is nine years, and a state exam is taken after that. Depending on its result, a Russian can continue his education for two more years in school, enter a vocational school, or simply graduate and enter the workforce. A vocational school lasts 2 to 4 years, and sometimes allows entering a university\u2019s second year without an exam. Most Russians choose 11 years of school, and graduate at 17\u201318 years of age by passing a unified state exam. By then, they have an internal passport, the document the state uses to interact with a citizen in Russia. Most interactions with the state are now done through an MFC (multifunctional center), which handles the forms and applications for most state services, then hands out the resulting documents when they\u2019re ready. Traveling abroad requires receiving a \u201cforeign\u201d (international) passport; it\u2019s issued all but automatically unless the citizen has access to top state secrets. Here\u2019s a map of visa requirements for Russian citizens (the English version appears outdated, failing to reflect, say, China providing visa-free entry for organized tour groups). Since age 18 a Russian might apply for a driver\u2019s license. That requires attending a driver\u2019s school for half a year, which costs some 30k RUB (~600 USD), followed by an exam (multiple choice test on the traffic laws, standard exercises like backing up a slope or parallel parking, then driving around in the city with an instructor without breaking any traffic laws). A driver\u2019s license can be used as an ID, but hardly everywhere, and the internal passport is preferred. Since age 18 a Russian might apply for a firearm license. Only longarms are allowed, with mandated minimal length and maximal magazine size. No auto fire. A firearm license requires passing a medical commission, and is refused to psychiatric patients, addicts, and former convicts. Initially, only shotguns can be purchased, but after three years without issue, rifles are legal to buy, too. Since age 21 \u201ctraumatic weapons\u201d can also be bought, which require a license similar to that for a firearm, and are essentially pistols modified for only shooting rubber bullets, with the law limiting maximal muzzle energy. Crushing weapons are illegal to carry, but knives are legal, and the regulations on what is a bladed weapon as opposed to an utility knife are lax. Tasers and mace sprays are legal and require no license. Bows and crossbows, too; but their maximal tension is limited by law. At ages 18 to 27 a male Russian is due for conscription. Conscription is for 1 year, first an education course that lasts a couple months, then off to the regiment. Conscripts can also become sergeants. Alternatively, instead of 1 year conscription one might sign a two year contract with the army, or a 1 year one if a university graduate. Contract soldiers are treated better, generally, get better living conditions, and are more likely to gain actual combat skills rather than just washing, clearing, painting and servicing everything at the base like conscripts. Army service is a requirement for certain kinds of state employment, especially security services and law enforcement. Generally speaking, serving in the army is at best useless, at worst actively painful. Conscripts getting combat skills past the very basic firearm usage, fortification and using the hardware assigned for their MOS are few and far between. Generally speaking, unless living in some economically depressed town or federal subject with high unemployment, most Russians seek to avoid conscription, which makes it a huge source of corruption. Those who do seek to serve usually go for a contract from the get-go; and women might only serve voluntarily, either as contract soldiers or officers. At 18 years of age, having passed the school unified state exam and using the scores acquired, Russians might enroll in a university. Those who pass study free (no tuition, no book prices, no nothing); those who fail by a small margin might study if they pay; and those who pass spectacularly might get into the dorms. The best universities are state-owned ones in the large cities, those are hard to study in, however, there are also private unis who all but trade degrees for money. A university student in Russia doesn\u2019t get to pick subjects, she picks her future specialty and attends the assigned standard set of courses. Every half a year, exams must be passed for each subject. Failing the exams leads to expulsion and having to take that same course next year. There\u2019s a trick here, however: universities prevent conscription as long as one hasn\u2019t been expelled, so for a male Russian, failing the exams can mean spending a year in the army before he can return to his education. Furthermore, certain universities have officer reserve corps courses, which make their graduates lieutenants, making them ineligible for conscription. The rest of the officer corps is made out of cadet school graduates, cadet school essentially being analogous to a university in lasting five years after 11 years of school. Universities can provide either a five-year specialist course, or a three year bachelor course and a two year master\u2019s (\u201cmagister\u201d) course, though. Russian advanced degrees differ from those in the West: should he decide to stay at the uni and devote himself to science, a Russian first gets a candidate of sciences degree (equivalent to a PhD), then a doctor of sciences degree. Both require writing a thesis. Candidates of sciences are ineligible for conscription. This way or another, having completed his education and performed his military duty, a Russian enters the workforce pool. Overall unemployment in Russia is low, at about 5%, but it differs vastly across the nation (see here, note that the numbers on the map correspond to federal subject number in the table on the right). Average wage is 38k RUB (~675USD), but again, differs vastly, with the highest wages paid in Moscow, St.Petersburg, and the oil-producing provinces. Average wage is some 2.3 to 5.7 times the subsistence wage (as per the map here). Average wages also differ between professions, doctors making about 50k, nurses 25k, teachers 30k, university professors 50k, drivers 20k, jet pilots 300k, contract soldiers 25k, mechanics and electricians 40k, office workers 30k, IT professionals 60k. It should be noted that those numbers are all final, as in, what the workers get at the end of the day, because it\u2019s the employer who pays the taxes (including even the income tax) and the social security payments. Income tax is 13%, and taxes plus social security payments cost the employer about again as much as a worker\u2019s wages. So, if the average wage is 38000 RUB, what does it buy? A liter of gas is some 35 rubles, a kilo of potatoes or rice about 50, chicken 180, pork 250, beef 400. A pack of Marlboro cigs is 120 rubles, half a litre of Heineken in a tin 85, a bottle of Crimean wine 500, half a litre of Absolut vodka 700 (all can only be bought from 8 am to 10 pm, even though most Russian shops work around the clock), weed a 1000 per gram (illegal to sell, illegal to own more than six grams, illegal to grow). A coat is some 2000, jeans start at 1000, shoes easily 3000 (naturally those three are all very approximate, and given for new items, not second-hand). Renting a one-bedroom flat in Moscow starts with 20k a month, and down to half that in the regions (but about 80% Russians own their flats, and pay about one tenth that in taxes instead). Electricity, water, gas, sewage and such are at least 2000 rubles a month. Heating is normally centralized in cities, turned on centrally for the whole block of flats once it\u2019s cold enough, and turned off once it\u2019s warm enough for that. Generally speaking, it\u2019s very warm in Russian homes even in winter, many Westerners actually find it uncomfortable. An internet connection with unlimited traffic and 60 mbits costs some 400 rubles; cell phone internet costs about 300 for 5 GB (4G is available in cities, otherwise the connection can be pretty slow - here\u2019s a map of coverage by MTS, for instance). Last year, Lada Granta was in top-3 of cars bought new; it costs upwards from 240k (you can see prices for other models here). Second-hand cars are much cheaper, and a ten-year Mersedes can cost as much as a new Renault sedan. On average, Russians have one car per family. About 75% of Russians live in towns and cities; thus rural population is some 25%. A one-bedroom flat in Moscow costs at least 5 million rubles, 7 for two-bedroom, 9 for three-bedroom (this is all for Khrushev-era blocks of flats, better houses naturally cost more). Provincial real estate can cost as low as half that, but that strongly depends on location - say, Crimea is as expensive as Moscow, if not more! One ar (100 square meters) of land for building starts at some 100k and can get into millions per ar for prime real estate under Moscow. Some 40% Russians own dachas - small suburban houses which normally come with six ars of land. My own dacha is 15 km from Moscow, reachable by suburban train, and an ar in the village costs upwards from 500k. Farming land is much cheaper, starting at 100k a hectare in the arable provinces, but it\u2019s only sold in large chunks and cannot be legally built upon. Money is relatively expensive in Russia. Inflation is high, floating at about 7% (4% this year, 7% before that, 14% in 2015). Consumer credit rates are at about 12\u201315%, mortgage starts at 7%. Consumer credits have been significantly growing lately, and an average citizen owes the banks some 70k by now (but those are generally paid in time). Hm, let\u2019s end this rant with some more numbers. An average citizen\u2019s life savings are now at 130k rubles; average age is 40 years; on average, a Russian owns 24.4 square meters of real estate (per person). At age 60 for men and 55 for women the state starts paying pensions to Russian citizens depending on how long they\u2019ve worked and how much they earned. The pensions are pretty meager, some 10 to 15k rubles, and minding that most drugs (outside, of course, of emergency care and hospitalizations) have to be bought, surviving on these without kids helping can be challenging. There are additional social payments, but those are rarely significant, either. Life expectancy for males in Russia is 67 years, for females 77. About half the dead are cremated, the rest buried in coffins. tl;dr: life in Russia sucks, avoid if possible. ",

            "answer_text": "As a tourist you may enjoy living in Russia for some time, provided that you have enough money to live on: foreigners are badly overcharged everywhere. If you decide to stay there on a permanent basis, your life will become a nightmare very soon. Over the past few decades, millions of Russian citizens have emigrated from their country, and this should answer your question (yes, many have immigrated to Russia, too, but these are nationals of the countries that are even more troublesome: Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, etc.) Note that practically all Russian millionaires and billionaires tend to send their wives, children and parents away from Russia - to Europe or the US: They are concerned with their safety, healthcare problems, and (in the case of the children) lack of educational opportunities. As a permanent resident of Russia, you would have to deal with two major evils: the government and the crowd. The moment you need something, whether it is obtaining a resident permit or getting or driver\u2019s license, problems will emerge. In fact, just a police officer passing by may cause you a trouble. I have been stopped and questioned by these people quite a few times: They would check my passport, registration, and all other bureaucratic garbage that Russians are so good at creating. The purpose was simple - to extort a bribe or just to show who the boss was. Those things are inevitable, given the corrupt and toxic nature of the Russian political system. As a foreigner, you will be abused, harassed and humiliated by the Russian immigration system on a regular basis. To get a simple temporary permission to stay would require numerous visits to immigration offices and endless waits, and would end up with multiple screw ups by brainless immigration officers. The problem is that the toxic nature of the Russian system impairs not just the government employees but also the crowd. This should be of no surprise because it is the ordinary people who elect their government, and each nation deserves its rulers. Every Russian individually may be a nice person; together, they form a monstrous and aggressive mass, which hates everyone. This hatred may be directed against their own, but foreigners would be the first target. Aside from all of that, be prepared to deal with incompetent physicians; counterfeited and long expired medication in pharmacies; pickpockets, assailants and drunk hooligans on the streets (two of my friends were attacked within the first year of their stay in Russia; my other friend\u2019s father - a 70 year old play director, Russian, was murdered in the lobby of his own building); rude sales and service clerks; chronic lack of change with a store cashier in any store; prospects of food poisoning at many eateries; bad weather; flue epidemics; air pollution; total lack of legal or social protection; and many other wonderful things that define the REAL LIFE IN RUSSIA. Yes, there are lots of wonderful things there: opera and ballet companies, breath- taking museums, extraordinary violinists and ice hockey players, sexy and easy going girls, etc. But you do not live your life in a museum in a company of ice hockey players. And the girls \u2026 if you are a Westerner, for most of them you will be a human vehicle to take them out of Russia. I was born in Russia and spent the first 24 years of my life there before emigrating to the US. When I returned to Russia 17 years later, the first year was fantastic, but then the government and crowd factors began to come into play and I left again - just could not stand this country\u2019s vices and evils. P.S. Yes, there are foreigners, Americans included, who would tell you that Russia \u201cis a wonderful place to live in.\u201d Usually, it\u2019s naive tourists, who never tried to live in Russia as non-tourists usually; or those who have some financial or economic interest at stake in Russia - investors, small-time businessmen, or employees of multinational companies, so their positive opinion of Russia is self-serving). But some Westerners may be also admirers of North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, or ISIS. In fact, quite a few Westerners have emigrated to the ISIS or Taliban-controlled areas in South Asia. ",
