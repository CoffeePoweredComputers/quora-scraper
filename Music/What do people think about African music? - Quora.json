            "answer_text": "I want to address the question itself first. It is if the African music is not produced by people. Maybe what you wanted to ask was \u201cWhat do outsiders think about African Music? Is that my shallow take maybe. But i feel it paints a picture as if African music is not produced by people. Which people are you referring to? Let me assume that i have understood you, then African music comes in different genres, its very difficult to understand what you are asking here? There is Zimbabwean music which is very different from Kwasakwasa , there is mbotosha in Malawi, there is kwaito, there is house, There is a Reggae too. Are studying music? ",
