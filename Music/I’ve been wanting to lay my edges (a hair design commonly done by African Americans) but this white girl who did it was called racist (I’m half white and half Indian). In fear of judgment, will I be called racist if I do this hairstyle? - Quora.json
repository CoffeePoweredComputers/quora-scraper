            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A You wanna do a hair design (laying edges) but you think you might be called racist? I\u2019m not one for throwing out the R card but on hairstyles that, pretty low key and most people would ignore it unless you made it a big deal. In terms of the white girl, I think more has to do with what she was doing while having the hairstyle. For example, if said white girl did blackface, threw on a prison jumper that and generally being foolish then yeah, that all types of stupidity. If said white girl was doing something different that her norm with while rocking said hairstyle, it depends on the situation but calling her racist for rocking a different hairstyle I would say that person calling her that is talking out their proverbial ass If she was genuinely just wanting to try out a new hairstyle because she saw another black girl try it out\u2026good for her. I\u2019ve seen some white girls and guys pull off Black hairstyles WELL. For example, this is a guy before your time. His name is Bob Ross. When you think of painting and influences this is guy your parents probably watched.  This guy rocked an AFRO and did so quite well. Did Black people have an issue with his style, nope but he could paint the hell of some pretty trees and forest. My point is this, be bold, its your hair, do what you want. Find a style you like and run with it. No one holds a trademark on hairstyles. Unless you\u2019re cutting your hair into the shape of a SS or Nazi symbol or something. That's just racist. Unless you\u2019re an old school Buddist. ",

            "answer_text": "It might be an interesting exercise developing your own character to do the hair style and experience the reaction. If you\u2019re sure you want to do that \u2018do because you like it and think it will look good on you, then clearly you\u2019re not being racist. You\u2019re merely expressing admiration and that is a good and healthy thing that should exist in the world, especially in this context. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. If you get challenged about it and you defend yourself with that adage you are bringing the conversation forward in a good way. And you\u2019ve learned to stick with your own convictions whether they are popular or not. You\u2019re also giving people who have a lot of frustrated emotion about being ripped off while not acknowledged an opportunity to revisit that emotion in an environment where it can find some closure. Or, if they are simply people exploiting the controversy to bully someone, you are developing your capabilities to stand up to such characters. ",
