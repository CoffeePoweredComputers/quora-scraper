            "answer_text": "Its something like the admonition to buy Real Estate - \u201cThey aren\u2019t making any more of it\u201d. Quality Control issues with some marques dictate that not all guitars are \u2018good ones\u2019, and in fact there are a lot of old instruments that have survived into this day and age simply because they weren\u2019t good enough to be played a lot. These rejects are available now simply because they were relegated to idle storage. My point here is that \u2018old\u2019 does NOT necessarily equal wonderful. That said, the law of supply and demand applies here. Production runs were small compared to modern volumes, and attrition over the years reduces the number of survivors. Then there\u2019s the \u2018mojo factor\u2019 to consider. There were not a lot of good guitars to choose from \u2018back in the day\u2019, so certain marques and models have gained a mythical aura simply because they were used by revered guitar heroes. In my estimation, the vintage guitar market has been wildly distorted by people with more money than musicianship, leading to good guitars being condemned to indefinite imprisonment in storage vaults. The value of these acquisitions has nothing to do with their suitability to making music. Their worth is entirely based on the concept that someone, somewhere is willing to pay even more than the grossly inflated price paid by the current owner. I can\u2019t speak to the investment value of something like a \u201957 \u2018burst LP. I\u2019ve played one, and to me it wasn\u2019t all that. YMMV. I suggest we are currently in a Golden Age for guitar players. Instruments on the market today for very affordable prices are light-years ahead of highly prized vintage guitars that sell for outrageous prices. I have some recent-production Gretsch guitars that have exemplary fit, finish and playability. They far exceed the quality of older instruments with the same name on the headstock. For all the sentimental glow attached to earlier hand-made production from all makers, modern manufacturing techniques are capable of delivering consistently high quality at affordable prices. There will always be junk on the market that should be avoided, but the probability of finding a sweet-playing, great-sounding guitar at a reasonable price is higher now than it ever has been. ",

            "answer_text": "Vintage guitars are expensive for the same reason tin and metal toys from the 50\u2019s are expensive: nostalgia, materials and myth. Materials  Back in the day, when acoustic and electric guitar manufacturing really hit it\u2019s stride, the materials used to make them were in most respects\u2026high grade compared to today\u2019s stuff. There weren\u2019t as many guitar players back then, so guitars were given a lot of \u201cbling\u201d to entice the (then) niche market into buying. So, it was the Brazilian Rosewood (and it\u2019s equally awesome brethren) on everything back then (Brazilian Rosewood being a very, very nice and sought after tone wood) and lots of mother of pearl inlay, purfling, etc. As it happens guitar manufacturer\u2019s brilliance was equaled by their stupidity. While their genius allowed them to innovate and lock in a slew of masterful designs we still use today, their stupidity left them blind as to the limitation of what they were using to make those innovations. The wood. It turns out that not all trees are created equal, nor are tone woods. Especially how that tone wood is made. The stuff used back then was largely from \u201cold growth\u201d rain forests, which if science tells us anything, takes a long assed time to make. And the best of the best not only took a long time to make\u2026it came from a special place very few understood as being the key to it\u2019s superior tone qualities; on and around the equator. A quick explanation: While a tree grows and ages, it develops rings and does so while moving. \u201cWait?! Trees move?!\u201d Yes, to follow the sun. While thats happening, their grain pattern changes accordingly. Tighter grain and loose grain in the same tree, makes for inefficient harvesting of tone wood. So, imagine if you will a tree, growing up in Canada following the sun as it rises and sets, East to West, every day and doing so for years and years and year. The grain along one side of the tree\u2019s would be tight and compacted the other side spread out because of it bending toward and following the sun. The grain isn\u2019t consistent throughout the trees. They can be used for guitars, of course, just not as good a quality as trees with more consistent grain. Equatorial trees however twist back and fourth as they follow the sun, making almost the entire tree a consistent, tonal grain from which you get more usable guitar tone wood from a single tree. It just so happens that, that process doesn\u2019t happen over a weekend and much to the disbelief of every guitar maker worldwide, is actually finite due to aging.  Now, due to cheaper alternatives to mother of pearl and over harvesting of and the wholesale \u201cslashing and burning of millions of acres of rain forests\u201d filled with the stuff, we don\u2019t have as much as we used to. In fact a lot of those sought after \u201ctone wood\u201d species are now endangered. So, where can a desperate guitar player hungry for that sweet rare tone wood sound go for their fix? Vintage guitars. During the heyday of rain forest tone wood, every guitar manufacturer had their hands in the pot, even the cheap builders, because they figured \u201cWe\u2019ll just grow more! They\u2019re f*ckin\u2019 trees for God\u2019s sake.\u201d Well, joke was on them. So, not too long ago, you could score a decent knockoff acoustic and it might have been entirely of a rare tone wood, causing the buyer to sputter with orgasmic joy at the find. The guitar world and it\u2019s many dealers have caught up to that, as it is prone to do, so things like that are exceedingly hard to come by. Well, unless you pony up the dough, that is. That\u2019s one reason why they\u2019re expensive: the materials. Myth The role of myth rears it\u2019s ugly head a lot within the realm of vintage guitars. Everything from where a guitar was made, who made it, who played it and what it\u2019s made of can raise or lower and instruments value considerably. Often for no actual reason at all. People sometimes associate the quality of an instrument with whomever played it.  It\u2019s silly, of course, as it\u2019s the talented musician playing well that makes a guitar sing. It isn\u2019t a certain type or brand, that somehow, because of that musician\u2019s playing that makes that brand extraordinary. An example of such a phenomenon might be the valuation of acoustic guitars used by blues players during and immediately after the Great Depression. Today, guitars made during this time are highly prized for their tonal qualities and \u201cauthentic blues sound\u201d, sometimes fetching prices into the hundreds of thousands. Yet, when they were first made they were more or less poorly made throw away guitars, produced cheaply and with little fanfare. Blues players in the Delta picked them up specifically because they were cheap. They didn\u2019t mind the sound quality (most thought they sounded like sh*t, but all in all, it was what they could afford and made do. The same holds true for Gibson Les Pauls of the 50\u2019s which today sell for well\u2026around $150,000 but, when first made, no one bought them. They weren\u2019t sought after until people like Jimmy Page up there got a hold of them (often finding them in pawn shops on the cheap) and turned them into a cornerstone of rock & roll they are today. A myth can build around just about anything on a guitar (material, builder, event, etc.) of any year and the vintage market will adjust their prices accordingly, you can bank on it. Nostalgia Nostalgia can be a heavy hitter when applied to guitar buy. Everyone loves their first car, their first real girlfriend and the first time they strapped on a guitar that they could truly call their own. Often they want to experience those and things like them again\u2026to recapture the spirit of some earlier time. Youth maybe. Sometimes, they want to feel like the rock star that inspired them to play guitar in the first place and now that they\u2019re older and can afford it, seek out the instrument that rock star used back then. To walk (or play) in his/her shoes, so to speak. All of that plays a big part in vintage guitar pricing. When a player wants to buy their \u201cone that got away\u201d guitar or one like it, they usually pay a premium for the privilege. When they discover that \u201cfirst guitar\u201d again in a vintage guitar shop, they\u2019ll drop a hefty sum to relive an experience despite better quality, newer, and cheaper alternatives at the ready. People trash guitars a lot too, either through accident or just plain carelessness. That also helps to drive up the prices on the ones that survived the madness of years, regardless of their quality. So, when you see some fool spending $150,000.00 Gibson Les Paul Standard \"Burst\" 1958-1960 it\u2019s probably because they or someone they knew had one. Maybe, they\u2019re associating it with their past and want to reconnect with it via a vintage guitar. Hell, maybe they want to be feel like Jimmy Page in that picture way up there. But, what they don\u2019t want to realize is that Jimmy Page looks like this today:  And they\u2019re just hoping to buy back some years. I hope this helps. ",
