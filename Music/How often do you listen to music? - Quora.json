            "answer_text": "Music,a divine medicine that mends our bleeding heart can be listened at any place and time. You have a favourite song and there is a story, purpose behind every song as to why you have chosen it over on that moment. I listen to music almost every 1 hour as I work. My radio is tuned on with fresh aroma of the morning tea and snacks,as it soothes all the stress that I had piled for that day. Nothing is better than a beautiful morning,relaxed mind and a music that nurture your soul. Often when I travel to some place, or might be a workplace, I plug-in my headphones and switch over to my songs depending over my mood,but I ensure that I sit over by the window so as to make sure that the scene that's displayed in front syncs with the music. Climate is not at all exceptional,especially when its rainy,you will prefer some classic melody, and different music for different seasons,whereupon the playlist is created solely for that reason*sweatdrops\ud83d\ude05. After I get home from work,sometimes early, I go to my music room,wherein I keep my instruments, I have only one, take my bass and start playing it. Music can not only be listened,but also sung especially while your showering, turning your favorite karoake on either from your moblile or your set,whatever it is, excited you to no hell. Music has different notes,high,low medium,some pop and some country and each person has different taste and contrast of songs that can match and some differ. I often listen music with my friends, we dance in our free time and get lost in it. But they only apply during the weekends or over the times when we do sleepover. There is no end to this music saga, you see it everywhere like in movies, where that scene enthralls you with its bgm, during weddings, during the time of birth and death,its chapter never ends, its a never ending cycle where you grow and die in it. It never tires you, and heals your heart and soul like a pleasant Christmas morning. It's a pleasant sound, opposite to the noise that dysfunction our day's routine So always keep in mind\u2026LISTEN TO GOOD MUSIC\ud83d\ude04 ",

            "answer_text": "I started paying for Spotify premium the second I got my current phone, two years ago, spending half my allowance for the month on it. I would\u2019ve spent every cent if that was what it took. My phone counts the amount of hours I spend on each app. According to it, I spend approximately two a day on Quora, two a day on hangouts, one a day on Instagram, and\u2026 wait for it\u2026 eight hours every day on Spotify. I spend seven hours in school. I spend one hour eating and waking up. There are about sixteen waking hours in a day. That means I spend every free second I have listening to music constantly. When I was eleven years old, I got so tired of not being able to listen to music when I wanted to that I spent two months doing chores, mowing lawns, and saving my entire allowance until I could afford an ipod touch. Then every penny I had went towards buying music. I was a focused child. Very determined. My deepest regret in life is that I am incapable of creating music. Completely tone-deaf. Totally off pitch. Terribly musically clumsy. When I\u2019m listening to music, I feel real. Important. Focused. Loved. Creative. Alive. Music is the spark in my veins. I never do any of the things I do that are so great without first being inspired by a song. It brings me to life. ",
