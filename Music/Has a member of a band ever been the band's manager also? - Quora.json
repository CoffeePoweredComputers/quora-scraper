            "answer_text": "Tommy Ramone (born Tam\u00e1s Erd\u00e9lyi) was the Ramones\u2019 manager and producer when they first formed in 1974; he had never even played the drums before. But Tommy was tasked with demonstrating their songs\u2019 beats for prospective drummers, and eventually they realized that their manager was a better drummer than any of the drummers they auditioned, so their manager became their drummer, too. Tommy was replaced as the band\u2019s manager by Danny Fields in 1975, but he did produce their first four albums, the last of those, 1978\u2019s Road to Ruin, after he had quit as their drummer and been replaced by Marky Ramone (born Marc Bell); Tommy then returned to produce their eighth album, Too Tough to Die, in 1984.

            "answer_text": "The New Riders of the Purple Sage were a country rock band that was an early 70s offshoot of the Grateful Dead. The original lineup of the band featured Dead members Jerry Garcia on pedal steel guitar and Mickey Hart on drums. They were initially an opening act for the Dead on tour and Garcia and Hart played with both bands. However, as the NRPS began to write and record their own material on albums, they wanted to tour independently of the Dead, so replacements had to be found for Garcia and Hart. Pedal steel player Buddy Cage replaced Garcia and drummer Spencer Dryden, who had previously been a member of the Jefferson Airplane, replaced Hart. For whatever personal reasons, Dryden later quit touring and playing with the New Riders and became their manager. ",

The Hall of Fame bluegrass band the Seldom Scene was booked by their mandolin player, John Duffey, until he died. After that, they hired someone. I was in a semi-local band in Topeka that was managed by the guitar player. He was a car salesman, whose presence was required from ten AM, but there was nothing to do til the afternoon, and he loved sales and schmoozing. So he'd spend that time on his cell phone, booking us, and getting us twice what we were getting before. But generally, we hate that part, so we pay people to do it. ",

That gets harder to do the more successful a band becomes. There are simply too many pitfalls for the average musician to avoid. They need someone familiar with contract law, knowledgeable about finance, and willing to work the phones to book gigs. Major artists have a phalanx of lawyers, accountants and promoters. The days are long gone when a record store owner with no experience in the music business could manage a local band into a worldwide sensation. Even the Beatles found out how hard it was after they disastrously decided to manage themselves. ",
