            "answer_text": "As soon as I wake up in the morning, a catchy song starts playing in my head, it's always a different song, and sometimes I don't know why it's that particular song playing in my head. This morning's song was \u201cReach for the Stars\", a particularly upbeat teen-pop toon which does get a bit irritating after a few replays, but it's really catchy and it won't shut up. I believe it's by S Club 7, though I'll stand corrected because I am not overly sure about that. It's not really my kinda music. Unusually, I actually do remember, this time, that there was a reason for this song! Last night, my husband and I were watching re-runs of Peter Kay's Car Share, a brilliant piece of comedy set in a car, pretty much entirely based around conversation and banter between two colleagues travelling to and from work. There are hidden extras thrown in, like the hilarious adverts on the radio (voiced by Peter Kay). Last night, Kaylee was talking about her ideal funeral, saying she wanted \u201cReach for the Stars\" reciting as serious poetry at hers. She then illustrated perfectly how it should be recited, down to the serious, faraway look in her eyes. So, so funny! When I wake up, I guarantee there will be a new song playing in my head. I hope it will be a less annoying one than \u201cReach for the Stars\". ",

I've been watching Celebrity Big Brother from 2006 as it's on YouTube and I like to rememisce by watching old shows even if they aren't Relevant today. The cast included the late, great and some would say eccentricity Pete Burns. Who is most known for his biggest hit with his band Dead Or Alive. It was played in the house once as am alarm to wake up the housemates and Pete also sang it live to them. What in incredible voice he had. Been stuck on my head ever since and I'm not sick of it.  ",
