            "answer_text": "If you mean their songs, contrary to what most Armys say, BTS members don\u2019t produce songs by themselves or even the majority. Most of their songs are produced by Pdogg (the majority), and somewhat less Slow Rabbit depending on the album. Ofc many other producers worked on their albums as well, but Pdogg and Slow Rabbit are somewhat more often listed as producers. BTS members are featured as producers on a few songs per album, ofc next to other producer for that song. ** In case your question also relates to writters, most of their songs is written by \u201chitman\u201d bang, Pdogg, Slow Rabbit, etc. BTS members participate in writting some of their lyrics, but they are featured with several other writters per song, and usually listed among last in order. If you look at some of their last Mv released songs, here are producers (and writters in order) that worked on them: \u201cIdol\u201d - produced by Pdogg (writter: hitman bang; Roman Campolo; Pdogg; RM; Supreme Boi; Ali Tamposi)\u201cEphihany\u201d - produced by Slow Rabbit (writter: hitman bang; Slow Rabbit; Adora)\u201cFake Love\u201d - produced by Pdogg (writter: Pdogg; hitman bang; RM)\u201cSingularity\u201d - produced by Charlie J.

            "answer_text": "Mainly, the producers of BTS are.. RM, J-Hope, Slow Rabbit, \u201chitman\u201d bang, Pdogg and Supreme Boi As example, No More Dream (debut song) is produced by Supreme Boi, J-Hope, Rap Monster, \"hitman\" bang, Pdogg. And the same producers did the music for BTS in 2013 for We Are Bulletproof Pt.2, N.O and BTS Cypher Pt.1 . In 2013 too, the song Outro: Circle Room Cypher is produced by Rap Monster, J-Hope, Jin, Jungkook, V, Jimin & Pdogg. We can see the participation of other members here. In 2016, Run (Ballad Mix) witnessed Suga as one of the producers alongside Pdogg, \"hitman\" bang, V, & Jungkook. And overall, there are always all members\u2019 participation in BTS music. Actually, there are many more name of producers but I can\u2019t write all. (Yeah, there\u2019s too many! BTS has so many..many..many songs! ^-^) ",
