            "answer_text": "In terms of music and company's catalogue, maybe. Overall business, not really. YG sold quite a few assets and closed down the businesses in different sectors to pay off the investors, which caused overall decrease of the company. In the meantime, other companies are contacting those artists who haven't been active since their debut, going independent is also the options so YG's loss in artist roster is given. Not to mention they need to focus on what they can sell - BB and BP, limited resources will be focused on existing artists with reputation, maybe some for newly recruited group. However, teaser image of new boy group - treasure - was just terrible. B & W image looked like temporary recruitment poster by amateur, all white outfit was just cheesey as hell. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, YG has gotten so much better since Blackpink and Treasure have come back as they have both had success with their comeback especially blackpink. iKON had a come back earlier this year as well, also Big Bang will probably come back later this year or early new year as they were supposed to comeback in coachella but that was cancelled. I think they will still come back but in a different way. Mino is having a solo comeback and AKUM has just had a comeback. It is also known that YG is currently creating a new girl group. Not to mention they have a new CEO who seems to be pulling they company back up with the amount of successful comebacks she\u2019s given. Overall yes and I can\u2019t wait to see treasure grow and the company regain a good reputation as all their artists are amazing. ",
