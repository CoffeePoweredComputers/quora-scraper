            "answer_text": "Oh my, this is a tough one. There are so many great Christmas songs. I\u2019ve always been that guy that will listen to Christmas music all year round because I love it so much, so choosing just one is impossible. Here are a couple of my favorites that jump to my mind at the moment. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing hundreds that I\u2019ll remember right after I make the post, though. By the way, all of these songs, I love all versions of them by pretty much any artist, but the ones I will be listing are just my personal favorite rendition. What I always find funny is that I\u2019m part of a very conservative part of the Christian faith that doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas as a religious holiday, but just as any normal holiday, and yet the religious songs always seem to be my favorites. What Child Is This? - Chicago (when those trumpets come in to put power behind that last verse\u2026.it\u2019s just magic) Little Drummer Boy - Josh Groban (the bagpipes just bring a whole new level to the song that is incredible) Silent Night - Brad Paisley (the quiet tone, just him and the acoustic, it\u2019s great; how toned down and stripped it is just compliments the song so perfectly) God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman - Any version (can\u2019t think of any particular one that I like) We Three Kings - Any version (same as above) SIDE NOTE: The above two songs, I can\u2019t think of any specific version of either that stands above others, but the Barenaked Ladies do a mashup of the two and it\u2019s top notch That\u2019s Christmas to Me - Pentatonix Christmas Canon - Trans-Siberian Orchestra Tennessee Christmas - Alabama (Tennessee pride!) Oh Holy Night - Carrie Underwood Breath of Heaven - Amy Grant Mary, Did You Know? - Pentatonix Where Are You Christmas - Faith Hill (a bit of a guilty pleasure) Angels We Have Heard On High - Any version ",

            "answer_text": "Living in the US in December means hearing a lot of Christmas music. However, as I\u2019m Jewish, the religious stuff generally does nothing for me, unless I\u2019ve somehow associated it with something else. So, for example, I intentionally put on \u201cHark the Herald Angels Sing\u201d once a year, bu that\u2019s because the whole cast of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life sings it at the end, and I do not skip watching It\u2019s a Wonderful Life in December.[1] This leaves the non-religious stuff. Now, I understand that \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d is essentially a perfect song, but it\u2019s not anywhere close to being a favorite of mine. For that, we have to go with the Big Three. All I Want for Christmas is You (Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff, 1994) This is one of the corniest, cheesiest songs I\u2019ve ever heard, but as evidenced by my previously mentioned love of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, this is more of a plus for me than a minus. Difficult to match for raw sentimentality, the correct recording of the song (Mariah Carey\u2019s, obviously, listen to anyone else only if you feel you don\u2019t appreciate Mariah Carey enough, because nobody, but nobody, measures up)[2] is a powerhouse of vocals that takes everything perfectly seriously yet doesn\u2019t leave you feeling drenched in treacle. (Also, yeah, the association with Love Actually does not hurt here. Did I mention I love the shamelessly, but genuinely, sentimental?)  Fairytale of New York (Jem Finer and Shane MacGowan, 1987) Others have recorded this one, but go with the original: the Pogues, featuring Kirsty MacColl, off the album \u201cIf I Should Fall From Grace with G-d.\u201d[3] Tonally, this one\u2019s pretty much the complete opposite of \u201cAll I Want for Christmas is You\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s bitter and savage. However, it\u2019s not some mindless subversion of Christmas crapping all over the spirit of the holiday, because there\u2019s a long sense of history in the song: yes, the two lovers singing it spend a good chunk of the song tearing each other apart, but they\u2019re still in love in their own way, and while it may not be healthy, it is genuine. Maybe not the strongest feel-good song of all time, but surprisingly uplifting for a song where people accuse each other of ruining each other\u2019s dreams.  What Do You Get a Wookiee For Christmas (When He Already Owns a Comb)? (Meco, 1980) Words cannot express how much I love this song. The Star Wars Holiday Special is infamous for being low quality, but the second attempt at a Christmas tie-in for Star Wars, the album \u201cChristmas in the Stars\u201d is\u2026 well, it\u2019s difficult to say whether it\u2019s worse or better, but it\u2019s infinitely more entertaining. Honestly, half the tracks of this one are worth listening to, including the one whose premise is a poncy English robot teaching a fart noise machine how to sing \u2014 no, really \u2014 but in the end, I have to go with a discussion on what one gets a Wookiee for Christmas. And by \u201cone,\u201d I mean \u201ca toy-assembling robot in a distant galaxy where Christmas still somehow is a thing.\u201d This one\u2019s something of a fractal of terrible songwriting and production, with every bad element being composed of smaller, but worse, elements. So yes, this song is not \u201cgood\u201d as that word is classically defined. It is not even \u201cmediocre,\u201d using words as they were designed to be used. But I love this song. At this point, it\u2019s not an ironic sort of love, it\u2019s the full-on, genuine, can\u2019t get enough of this, play it on full blast in mid-July type of love that mostly goes to show I have horrible taste in music.   [1] This also means \u201cHark the Herald Angels Sing\u201d is one of two songs that can get me to cry pretty much instantly, the other being \u201cAuld Lang Syne.\u201d The ending of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life leaves me utterly wrecked. [2] Though I would be interested to see what Adele could do with this one. [3] Not a Christmas album. This is almost certainly the most famous track off the album, although the whole thing\u2019s well worth a listen. \u201cThousands are Sailing\u201d is another particular highlight. ",

            "answer_text": "Since 2012, my favorite Christmas song has been Kelly Clarkson\u2019s \u201cUnderneath the Tree\u201d Back in 2012, there were two \u201cRed\u201d albums that were released by superstar pop singers in the fourth week of October. The first was Taylor Swift\u2019s fourth album Red on October 22 and the second was Kelly Clarkson\u2019s Christmas album Wrapped in Red on October 25. I liked Taylor\u2019s album, but I loved Kelly Clarkson\u2019s album.  The highlight of Wrapped in Red was the second track, an original Christmas recording that she co-wrote with producer Greg Kurstin called \u201cUnderneath the Tree.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of song that you hear and swear that it\u2019s a cover because it has that vintage sound and songwriting style, but after you do the research you realize it\u2019s actually new.  That oldie feel of the song is a part of what makes it so special. It\u2019s a big band style pop song with a diverse brass arrangement, and it uses lots of background bells and chimes to resemble a Phil Spector production. Because of that mix of instrumentation and their own version of the Wall of Sound, \u201cUnderneath the Tree\u201d resembles an AM radio song that one would have heard anytime between the 1930s and the 1960s. \u201cUnderneath the Tree\u201d was one of four original Christmas songs that Clarkson cowrote for this album. Each one is strong, but this is the best. The studio version of \u201cUnderneath the Tree\u201d is great, but the live version (in the video) below is equally good.  I often get the impression that most mainstream musicians create Christmas albums as an easy cash grab. They serve as little more than fan service. Clarkson\u2019s is different, since this was a passion project for her. She had wanted to make a Christmas album since her days on American Idol, not just from a love of Christmas music, but also to give herself a platform to show that she could perform different genres of music. Wrapped in Red was a real breath of fresh air among contemporary Christmas albums. I recommend the whole album, but my favorite song is \u201cUnderneath the Tree,\u201d which I would say is the best wholly original Christmas song since Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite Christmas song is The Ragpicker\u2019s Dream by former Dire Straits front man Mark Knopfler. It\u2019s a beautiful, melancholy song about two hobos, Rail-king and the Scarecrow, who roll into town on Christmas Eve or thereabouts. They take refuge from the cold in a dive bar, drink too much whiskey and beer, sing and dance, and flirt with a waitress with beautiful hair. After imbibing a concoction known as ragpicker\u2019s dream\u2026 The rail-king lay rocking He was leaving the ground Then he was flying like Santa Claus Over the town where He came to the window Of a house by a stream It was a family Christmas In the ragpicker's dream there Were kids at the table All aglow in the light Music in the wintertime Sure carries at night there Was turkey and gravy Pie and ice-cream And gifts for each and everyone In the ragpicker's dream\u2026 Something happens at the bar and the cops show up to roust the hobos and beat them senseless with their clubs\u2026 The scarecrow and the rail-king Have started to dance But a nightstick and a billyclub Won't give peace a chance here I think they went thataways Your song and dance team Heading home for the holidays With the ragpicker's dream on His knees like a fighter The rail-riding king Like a sack of potatoes Like a bull in the ring where The scarecrow falls over With a tear in the seam Home for the rover In the ragpicker's dream\u2026 It is a beautiful sad song, both hopeful and bleak, and it reminds me that even the most marginalized, outcase individuals of society dream of an idyllic childhood of the past around the holidays. The image of the \u201ckids at the table all aglow in the light\u201d is shockingly echoed in the final four lines of the song, as the cops beat the hobos into oblivion\u2026 They cornered two castaways In a white flashlight beam Merry Christmas and happy days In the ragpicker's dream I\u2019m not a religious person, but this shift in the narrative reminds me of how the story of a joyous birth we celebrate at Christmas ends with another outcast from society dying on a cross.

And I shook 'no'We searched together, together until it was time for coffeeThe family having coffee, but I didn't want anythingI was thinking of Flappie and how cold and freezing it could be at nightMy head hung down quietly, crying fat tears of sorrow Because I did lock the cage securilyLike I did every eveningI even went back last nightI don't even know why I did thatI had stood in front of the cage for a long whileAs if I knew then what I know now It was the first day of Christmas 1961Dinner was noisy, but it didn't bother me muchI was thinking of Flappie, my own little FlappieWhere could he be? I couldn't eat a biteWhen after the soup the main course'd arriveMy dad said extremely funny: \"Look Youp, here is Flappie!\"I still see that silver tray and there he was in three piecesFor the first time I saw my dad as a horrible man! And I went to bed shrieking and poundingFirst spend an hour crying on the coversStood cursing at the top of the stairs one last timeAnd screamed: \"Flappie was mine!\"Stood in front of the window for a very long whileBut the cage just stood there forlorn It was the second day of Christmas 1961Mother still remembers it so well, dad's bed was emptyAnd I said that she wasn't allowed in the shedAnd if she'd play sweetly, she would get some goodies ",

It\u2019s a song that would actually summarize what Christmas is about.\u201cThe Season\u2019s Upon Us\u201d - Dropkick Murphys - You know it\u2019s most likely an Irish (or Irish-influenced) Christmas song when you sing about a dysfunctional celebration with lots of humorous anecdotes about drunken, lazy, mischevious people that make things nasty. Forget the overplayed stuff about a reindeer with nose problems and an obese grandpa who can somehow fly and climb down chimneys without breaking anything. This song is\u2026well\u2026hilarious.\u201cAK-47 (All I Want For Christmas Is An)\u201d - Dropkick Murphys - This one is a real way to have a punk rock Christmas. Once again, peace, love, and harmony have been taken out and shot as the real way to celebrate Christmas pops up - blow the entire place up. Honestly, that song should be played live and on radio more often. It\u2019s also catchy and energetic.\u201cFairytale of New York\u201d - The Pogues (featuring Kirsty MacColl) - Another fun Irish-influenced song. The vocals and the instruments also seem to paint a rather magical picture of New York City in wintertime, which, of course, becomes big with movies and captures the imagination of everyone. Once again, it\u2019s a funny song that probably talks about a relationship between two people.These 4 songs are easily the best Christmas songs I\u2019ve ever heard. I highly recommend listening to them. ",

            "answer_text": " This is my favorite version of the song. I have absolutely loved this song since the very first time I heard it. I like it without the vocals. To me, it\u2019s like the difference between a book and a movie. In a book, you imagine everything in your own world while in a movie everything is cannon. That\u2019s how I feel when people actually sing this song. It\u2019s one of those songs where I can listen to it for days and never get tired of it. The regular piano version is amazing of course, but I love the dark tone this version has. Second place would have to go to a song that used to scare me as a kid for some reason:  Dance of the Sugar-Plum Fairy is one of the Russian composer\u2019s greatest works, and I absolutely love it. If you want a dark version of the song, listen to this and put the playback speed at .75:  At 3rd place, I have to include a classic:  Specifically that version of the song, because it brings back memories from that movie. Christmas just isn\u2019t the same without Home Alone. At 4th, I\u2019d have to go with a song that\u2019s honestly gotten better with time:  One fateful holiday season, I heard this song played on the radio, and since then, I\u2019ve heard it more times than I can even count and I still absolutely love it. And at #5, I most certainly have to include:  This scene in the movie is absolutely amazing and very heartfelt, and the song just makes it even better. I love the holiday season, and I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. ",

            "answer_text": "THIS one. But first, some background... After WW2, European electronics giant Philips decided to enter the record biz. By that time, British recording giant EMI had SLIPPED as far as sound quality was concerned \u2013 their equipment being from the Thirties \u2013 so given Philips\u2019 equipment was brand NEW, the newcomer managed to wrest the European distribution rights to American behemoth Columbia\u2019s catalogue away from them. This resulted in their enjoying a decade of ready-made, middle-of-the-road hits. But as the contract\u2019s end approached and Columbia made it known they intended releasing THEMSELVES when it did, Philips got off their arses and began trying to find TALENT. Their best early signing was a folk trio called the Springfields. This comprised of Tom Springfield (Dion O\u2019Brien) his sister Dusty (Mary) \u2013 and some other guy. They had LOTS of hits around the turn of the Sixties, thus when they announced they were splitting up, a nation mourned. But actually, it turned out to be a GOOD thing \u2013 Tom was a folk nut, while Dusty preferred SOUL. And thus it was that Tom went off and discovered, then produced and wrote for an Australian folk group called the Seekers \u2013 who dominated the Sixties. While Dusty hooked up with composer/producer/arranger Ivor Raymonde and between them, they gave Philips a series of belting soul hits that, along with numbers by failed US group the Walker Brothers (none of whom, like the Springfields, were actually named Walker) CARRIED Philips through the mid-Sixties. Of course, all good things come to an end and like EMI, Decca and Pye, Philips lost the plot at the end of the Sixties (embarrassingly, they had to get EMI to press copies of a one-off novelty smash called \u201cCinderella Rockefella\u201d in 1968) and fizzled out during the Seventies. But to answer the QUESTION (and not a moment too soon) here is this now-long-forgotten, but in its day HUGELY successful Christmas hit from the Springfields. Come with me to 1961\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "As time passes, I notice that I long for simplicity more and more, when it comes to Christmas and Advent music. I prefer very old Christmas songs, preferably either instrumental or in Latin, songs that people sang alrealy in the Middle Ages. One of my favourites is Gaudete from the medieval copilation of songs Piae Cantiones. This interpretation by the Finnish group Lumen Valo is probably my favourite:  There are exceptions to the simplicity principle, though. I still do love many interpretations of old classics presented by Die Wiener S\u00e4ngerknaben, for example; one of my favourites is O du fr\u00f6hliche, o du selige. Its text was written by Johannes Daniel Falk after losing seven of his children to typhoid fever and founding a rescue house for abandoned children. He dedicated the song to the orphan children.  And I absolutely love the French song Cantique de No\u00ebl by Adolphe Adam. For personal reasons, my favourite interpretation is in Swedish, interpreted by no less than the maestro Jussi Bj\u00f6rling. I have never loved the Swedish language as much as when I listen to this song.  Naturally I also have my favourite Finnish Christmas songs. Here as well, simplicity is the key word, so I\u2019ll mention an old song written by Jean Sibelius, Jo joutuu ilta (Over Hill and Dale).  All these songs are lovely. There are dozens more that I really like. But to an increasing extent I tend to search for something very old and very unpretentious. That\u2019s why I love the music presented by the Norwegian lutist Rolf Lislevand. For the last couple of years, I think I would have survived with no other Christmas music than his record Jul i gammel tid (Christmas in old times). I find its ancient atmosphere really soothing and meditative. I love Mitt hjerte alltid vanker, for example. But my favourite song for the whole Christmas time is Veni, veni Emmanuel.  Preferably as a Rolf Lislevand verson, without words, just the ancient sound of the lute; but it\u2019s not available on Youtube, so here\u2019s a sung version, not less beautiful but just different.  Today is the first Advent, so it\u2019s the perfect time to start to listen to this song. ",

            "answer_text": "Carol of the Bells. There are so many damn good renditions of it and its one of the few pieces that doesn't drive me up the walls. I do have to say though, that my absolute favorite rendition, not for the music but the story behind it, is the Transiberian Orchestra performing   Christmas Eve/Sarajevo Christmas Eve/Sarajevo is a piece re-released by the Orchestra, having originally been penned by Savatage in '95, as a combination of \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\" and Carol of the Bells. It was originally envisioned as a piece about one lone Cello player playing a forgotten chrismas carol in the center of war-torn Sarajevo. The producer of the piece, Paul O'Neill stated, \"... We heard about this cello player born in Sarajevo many years ago who left when he was fairly young to go on to become a well-respected musician, playing with various symphonies throughout Europe. Many decades later, he returned to Sarajevo as an elderly man\u2014at the height of the Bosnian War, only to find his city in complete ruins. I think what most broke this man's heart was that the destruction was not done by some outside invader or natural disaster\u2014it was done by his own people. At that time, Serbs were shelling Sarajevo every night. Rather than head for the bomb shelters like his family and neighbors, this man went to the town square, climbed onto a pile of rubble that had once been the fountain, took out his cello, and played Mozart and Beethoven as the city was bombed. He came every night and began playing Christmas Carols from that same spot. It was just such a powerful image\u2014a white-haired man silhouetted against the cannon fire, playing timeless melodies to both sides of the conflict amid the rubble and devastation of the city he loves. Some time later, a reporter traced him down to ask why he did this insanely stupid thing. The old man said that it was his way of proving that despite all evidence to the contrary, the spirit of humanity was still alive in that place. The song basically wrapped itself around him. We used some of the oldest Christmas melodies we could find, like \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\" and \"Carol of the Bells\" part of the medley (which is from Ukraine, near that region). The orchestra represents one side, the rock band the other, and single cello represents that single individual, that spark of hope.\" Go ahead and tell me that didn't get to you, you damn liars. ",

After that, I'm done. Just about all other Christmas pop songs bring out my inner Grinch. Give me classic carols or make me temporarily hard of hearing, please. However, the ONE pop Christmas song that I think is utterly perfect and never grow sick of is Chris De Burgh\u2019s A Spaceman Came Travelling. I've heard several versions (it was released quite a few times, always sounding slightly different) and it's never anything short of flawless. Chris De Burgh - A Spaceman Came Travelling (1976) I maintain that this song and Boyfriend are the only two good things to come out of the 1970s. ",

Although it is now associated with the Christmas and holiday season, it was actually originally written to be sung for American Thanksgiving. Surprised?  White Christmas White Christmas is an Irving Berlin song reminiscing about an old-fashioned Christmas setting. Spreading so far, this classic Christmas song has several versions sung by its lovers, among which the Bing Crosby version is the most popular one. And data from the Guinness World Records, the version sung by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single of all time, with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies in the globe.

Even though I was then\u2014and remain to this day\u2014firmly atheist, there was a time in my life when I could recite a good chunk of the Catholic Liturgy from memory! (Ironically, only in Latin, not English.) I was particularly a fan of 16th c. Spanish and Flemish composers. Since I don\u2019t see them elsewhere on this answer thread, I\u2019ll list a couple of my favorite Renaissance Christmas songs. The first is a motet called O Magnum Mysterium, by Tomas Luis de Victoria, who also based an entire mass on it. The piece, written in 1572 when Victoria still resided in Spain during the Counter-Reformation, tells of the amazement with which the animals in the manger first perceived the birth of Jesus Christ. Several other notable composers wrote their own versions\u2014Victoria\u2019s more famous contemporary G.P. da Palestrina among them\u2014but today his is the best-known and probably the most-performed. One time I heard O Magnum Mysterium in a Medieval cathedral in Prague. No YouTube version is ever going to do this justice:  Word to the wise: make it a life goal to be sitting in a cathedral when the choir starts singing, and let yourself be overwhelmed by the sublime, mystical power of the Catholic musical tradition. Even if you\u2019re an irreverent heathen atheist like me, it\u2019s almost enough to make you believe god is speaking to you. My other favorite is also Spanish, this one a villancico titled with a famous verse from the book of John, which you may recognize from certain versions of Ave Maria (also a Christmas favorite): Verbum Caro Factum Est or, \u201cThe Word has been made into flesh\u201d. I don\u2019t really know much about this song, except that it dates probably from the 15th or 16th c., and that unlike O Magnum Mysterium it probably was made up by ordinary lay people, rather than commissioned by the Church. Apparently it was often accompanied by horns, cymbals or drums, which were a big no-no in official Church music (only the human voice and the organ were worth hearing in the House of God). It also mixes up Spanish and Latin in a hoppy, joyful tune:  Merry Christmas, Quorans, and remember: Don\u2019t go too hard with the punch and eggnog if you plan on driving later. ",

            "answer_text": "I have several Christmas songs, so let's start with  \"Gaudete\", the Steeleye Span version. OK their pronunciation has Latin \"purists\" cringing, but since we don't really know how the Romans pronounced Latin, those purists can go forth and multiply although not in those words. Next we have an instrumental,  \"In Dulci Jubilo\"as played by Mike Oldfield. OK it's another traditional tune, but played at a speed and in a style that matches its title \"Sweet Rejoicing\". As a sudden departure from the traditional, I present  The Pogues featuring Kirsty MacColl \"Fairytale Of New York\", and may I put forward my membership of the \"Keep the Fairytale Real\" pressure group. It's bad enough that some TV and radio stations took to blanking, muffling, and even bleeping out the odd word, I was in a shop earlier today where their muzac expert had replaced the whole section from \"You're a bum\" through \"I pray God it's our last\" to the end of the second \"And the bells were ringing out for Christmas Day\" with an instrumental break. Blasphemy I say! :) Finally,a Christmas Song that doesn't get played that much  \"Christmas Wrapping\" by The Waitresses. I know most people have had years like that. ",

It has a pretty unusual story for a Christmas song about being frustrated during Christmas time, and is delivered in an odd rappish kind of way (it was made when rap music was emerging in NYC, and gets its name from that!) I also really love the horn section, and most of all that killer bass line in the song! What makes this song even more cooler is that instead of being performed by a very popular musician (like a lot of popular Christmas songs), It\u2019s instead from some mostly underground New Wave/Post-Punk band in New York in the 80s! (The Waitresses pretty much only had two hits (I Know What Boys Like and Christmas Wrapping). just look at how the music video for their other hit! (This song is so awesomely cheesy!)  A Christmas song from some mostly underground 80s New Wave band just makes the song more interesting to me! ",

            "answer_text": "Of the Christian songs I\u2019m torn I really like Oh come all ye Faithful, The First Noel and Angels we have heard on high, up to the point that I would give a different answer on different days. As I\u2019m writing this I really like Angels we have heard on high, but that\u2019s only because I printed some sheet music for the First Noel that turned out to be too difficult to play.  Choir and organ performing \u2018Angels we have heard on High\u2019 Of the English secular songs, there is no doubt - The Three Tenors\u2019 cover of War is Over by John Lennon  This song touches all the right buttons: the child choir backing up the beautiful ringing in Pavarotti\u2019s voice, the darker Carreras bringing the neccesary dramatic impact and Domingo providing the extra power, it\u2019s just all perfect. Of the Dutch secular songs, I choose one that all Dutchmen know: Flappie, by Youp van \u2019t Hek  Flappie is a Christmas song by Dutch comedian Youp van \u2019t Hek about him celebrating Christmas when he was young, back in 1961 (\u2018t was kerstochtend, negentieneenenzestig). But his pet rabbit has gone missing, and he can\u2019t find him anywhere. His mother suggests a few places for him to search, but not in the bicycle shed, because well, it wouldn\u2019t be possible for him to be there, wouldn\u2019t it? He\u2019s probably somewhere out on the porch, but he\u2019s told that if he goes out and play he would get some sweets. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Refrein: Maar ik had het hok toch dichtgedaan, zoals ik dat elke avond deed? Ik was de vorige avond zelfs, nog terug gegaan. Ik weet ook niet, waarom ik dat deed. Ik had heel lang voor het hok gestaan alsof ik wist, wat ik nu weet Refrain: Hadn\u2019t I closed the rabbit pen, just like I did every evening? I even went back last night, though I don\u2019t know why. Long I stood in front of the pen , as if I knew then what I know now. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- And he grows all sad about how his bunny was missing, and how it can get so cold at night, and all the while Flappie is out there, alone. And Christmas Eve becomes the First Day of Christmas, and he searches the morning for Flappie everywhere, except the bicycle shed, because Flappie couldn\u2019t be there, could he?  And int he afternoon his family comes for coffee, but he didn\u2019t want anything to eat or drink, for he was crying so much. And then, in the evening they had dinner: Toen na de soep het hoofdgerecht moest komenSprak m'n vader uiterst grappig: \"Kijk Youp, daar is Flappie dan!\"Ik zie de zilveren schaal nog en daar lag 'ie in drie stukkenVoor 't eerst zag ik m'n vader als een vreselijke man! When after the soup the main dish cameMy father jokingly said: \u201clook Youp, it\u2019s Flappie!\u201dI beheld the silver plate, and on it he lay in three piecesFor the first time I saw my father as a terrible man! And he storms up the stairs to his room, crying and shouting about how Flappie was his rabbit, and how he stared at the pen, but now it was deserted, forever. Then, on the 2nd day of Christmas 1961 (Tweede Kerstday, negentieneenenzestig), his father went missing. And Youp tells her mother that she can\u2019t come into the bike shed, and if she goes out and to play he will get her some sweets. It\u2019s dark, funny and a good song. You don\u2019t hear it as much as you used to on the radio, but I always make sure I hear it at Christmas. I remember hearing it for the first time when I was in the car, driving with my parents to my grandparents, and I was almost brought to tears by the song. And even now, being in my 20s, it still touches me. But it\u2019s also something that makes me laugh everytime I listen to it! ",

Some just more than others. Jingle Bell Rock A bouncy song that is just Fabtabulouse? Hell yeah!! White Christmas Another beautiful song that deserves to be mentioned.

It's the build and the musicality. I\u2019ve performed it often, and, when I was able to hit that high note beautifully, holding it in a perfect vibratto, it was a bit of Christmas magic.

He and I didn\u2019t have a great relationship but, if there\u2019s one thing I can hand to em\u2019, it\u2019s that he had his charms. I always felt like those charms came alive particularly around the Holidays. He was a man of classic nature \u2014 it was one of the few things I liked about him. So if Christmas carols echoed through the house, it was those which he was familiar with during his childhood. If you remember my mentioning of his age, I\u2019m sure you can imagine, Christmas music of his choice was usually sang by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole, and Bing Cosby. Like I said\u2026 He was a man of classic nature. But!!! That being said, because the classics were a part of my childhood, till this day, no modern day singer could render me full of Christmas spirit like Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole. So it\u2019s not so much that I have a particular favorite. But I do have a preference in the Artist. ",

I tend to prefer Christmas music of a religious nature, but do like some secular Christmas songs. While O Holy Night is a marvelous piece of music, I\u2019m not sure why I like The First Noel so much, because it is not as great a piece of music, but it does seem to penetrate and uplift the soul, so maybe it is. I arranged The First Noel for symphony orchestra and created this music video featuring the music. I have plans to redo an arrangement I did of O Holy Night, but don\u2019t have a video of it yet. The First Noel video is not monetized, so I don\u2019t earn any money when you play it.  ",

My Dad owns a VHS tape with the song, and Pat A Pan was made into a music video. A boy receives a drum for Christmas from his parents, and since then started to play it. When he became a young man, he fell in love with a girl and married her before going into WW1. The man brought the drum with him as he fought in the war, hoping to come back home again. Meanwhile, his wife is pregnant with a son. Unfortunately he passed away, and his drum came home in a wagon. Years later on Christmas, the boy's Mother handed him a present. Opening it up it was his Father's drum, now passed on to him to play next. It's a great song, and a great video as well. ",

That is \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\", all versions, but in particular the Judy Garland recording that isn't the same one used in Meet Me in St Louis.  I wish I knew exactly where this one came from.  It is heartbreaking and beautiful.Honorable mentions include the entire Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Christmas album.  If you haven't yet heard it, you're welcome.  \"The Bell that Wouldn't Jingle\" may seem silly at first listen, but makes me cry everytime as it touches on one of my favorite themes- redemption.  It's so good!Gotta love Donny Hathaway's \"This Christmas\" and a little known modern joint by The New Pornographers \"Joseph, Who Understood\". ",

The tide turns, day will come again.  \u2014 Now, I might have a more modern streak as well. One of my favorite christmas films is the animation the Snowman. And the key song is Floating on the Air. Wonderful english original, but I feel like sharing the very fine translation and rearrangement by Charlotte Quale and Marte Wulff, for their christmas album \u2018Senk dine hvite vinger\u2019:  It doesn\u2019t have to be religious to be full of the yule spirit.
