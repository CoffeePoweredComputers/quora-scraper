            "answer_text": "Put a small group of investors together. Your equal share contribution is running the group. I've been telling everyone that for about a year on Quora.Three days ago, on Friday, I decided I was going to do the same thing: start an investment group just so I could tell about my experiences and successes with an investment group. I haven't even had time to start the LLC, when I got a phone call from a friend that I had helped in the past. They were calling me looking for a place to invest. I just told them I was starting an investment group and going to be investing in more real estate. My first investor put in $700K as an initial investment. The investors get their money back on every deal, then the profits are split. Rather than make this just a two party deal and keep half of the profit for myself, I decided that I wanted to help someone else get wealthy too. I invited him to participate as an equal partner witha three way split. His contribution is finding deals to invest in with me. He doesn't put any money into the deals either and will receive 1/3 of the profits from the LLC. The investor will make a huge return over what a bank would have offered them, and each deal is 100% backed by real estate at below market values.That's one way that you can make money without an investment. You will have to put in time and talent as your contribution. Make sure you are completely honest and upfront about everything if you try this. If you're not an honest person, you will very likely go to prison if you attempt this. I have a friend that will be in prison for seventeen years, because he tried this and got greedy. He stole from his friends/investors. He destroyed several families, made it so that a number of people would literally never be able to retire, and financially devastated dozens of people. My goal is for everyone to make a very nice additional income without using much of the investor's money. I think we can safely add at least $250K a year to each of our incomes and have some great fun doing it. Before long, we should have a number of additional paid off income producing properties and have an LLC worth low eight-figures. I'm not a rocket scientist. If I can do this, you can too! I'm doing it to show you that it can be done and what the results can become. I don't care what your daddy told you\u2026 It doesn't take money to make money! ",

            "answer_text": "The key is a high Return on Investment (ROI). For example, imagine that there are two investments, Investment A and Investment B. Investment A has an ROI of 2%.Investment B has an ROI of 5%.I mean, big deal, right? Just 3%, not a big difference\u2026 Let\u2019s do a simulation, though. If we invest $100 into Investment A and $100 into Investment B and wait ten years, what will happen? After one year: Investment A: $102 Investment B: $105 Big deal, right? Just put it in the 2% investment (e.g. a money market account at a bank). It\u2019s not worth it to go to the trouble to invest in something high-yield for just $3! Oh, wait\u2026 After three years: Investment A: $106.12 Investment B: $115.76 Okay, now we\u2019re starting to see a bigger difference\u2026 What about 10 years? Investment A: $121.89 Investment B: $162.88 Whoa! Big difference! Investment B outperformed Investment A by $40.99! What about 30 years? Someone thinking about retirement, at the beginning or towards the middle of his career, might think about a time horizon like this. Investment A: $181.13 Investment B: $432.19 The difference is between twofold and threefold! The key is a high ROI. Which things give high ROI? Stocks: They have very high ROI, but also have very high volatility. That means that on average, their ROI is some of the best, but in any given year (or even several years), they can go *WAY DOWN*!Real estate: This is much safer. The ROI is also quite high, probably not as high as with stocks, but unlike stocks, a sudden drop in value one year (or two years, three years, etc.) is very rare.Japanese real estate has a high average ROI if you buy it in major urban areas (Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, etc.). Average ROI in the 23 Special Wards of Tokyo is 5.5%. In the outlying areas, it\u2019s 6.5%. In specialty properties such as Niseko ski resort, it\u2019s 7%. With Japanese real estate (which not only Japanese people, but also foreigners, including overseas investors, can buy), you can make ROI like the one above in Investment B, maybe even better.  \u2191An Urban Area in Japan Imagine that there are two people, Person A and Person B. Person A has $100,000 to start. He puts his money in a money market account in the US with 2% interest. Person B has only $50,0000 to start ( :- ( ). He invests in Japanese real estate, making a 5% net ROI (ROI after property manager fees, taxes, maintenance and repairs, etc.). After 30 years, how will they have done? Person A will have $181,136.15. Not bad! Person B will have $216,097.11. WOW!!! And that\u2019s how you can earn money with less investment and more profit. Person B did it. So can you! There you go.
