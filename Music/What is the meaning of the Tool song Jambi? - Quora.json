            "answer_text": "Many elements of the song are based on a rather psychadelic-friendly children\u2019s TV show from the early 90s called Pee Wee\u2019s Playhouse. An occasional character on that show was a genie named Jambi, who uses a magical phrase \u201cmeka leka hi meka hiney ho.\u201d The rhythm of the song\u2019s main riff strongly resembles the rhythm of the magical phrase. Indeed, drummer Danny Carey has admitted that the name Jambi came from Pee Wee\u2019s Playhouse. Additionally, I believe there is a very strong chance, from the sound of it, that guitarist Adam Jones is saying something along the lines of \u201cmeka leka hi\u2026.. meka leka hiney ho\u201d into his talk box at the end of the talk-box guitar solo. The vowel sounds and syllables coincide. Besides, why else introduce a talk box?! Does that mean the song is about Pee Wee? No, that\u2019s the amateur approach to art critique\u2014tracing one allusion and then stopping there as if the mystery is solved. If the meaning of the song Jambi is Jambi from Pee Wee\u2019s Playhouse, we can\u2019t stop there. The question, then, is what is the meaning of Jambi from Pee Wee\u2019s Playhouse? ",
