            "answer_text": "Most guitar players make nothing,  or very close to it (<$1000/year). Local guitar players who supplement some other form of income by playing music make on the order of thousands of dollars per year.  It has been my experience that,  in a major urban center like Boston or Washington,  D.C., there are probably several hundred guitar players at this level. (This is what I currently do and recommend it) Full-time guitar players who are at the top of the heap probably can make $12-20,000 working in an established touring band or by establishing a series of weekly/monthly gigs. This is probably a couple dozen players in a large urban center. (I have done this and do not recommend it.) There are probably a couple hundred guitar players (the 0.1%) in the country that make more than this (a livable wage or more) as part of a major touring act,  a genre-based (jazz, etc.) virtuoso, a first-call studio musician, or a member of a public orchestra or military band. (These are genius level players, centered in \"music towns\" like LA, NY, Nashville, Washington, D.C., Boston,  or Austin.) Most guitar players that make their full-time living playing the guitar do so teaching,  either at the private or university level,  and supplement this with performance income. There are probably a few thousand people doing this.  If most of your thoughts and time on a daily basis center around playing guitar and that's all you ever want to do,  get a Masters or higher in performance or music education and pursue this route if you have any expectation of a livable,  stable income.

            "answer_text": "This is like asking how much a painter makes.  Is it Picasso?  Or is it your 4 year old cousin with watercolors?  I'm going to guess the range is anywhere from 0 to 20 million dollars a year, with most being skewed toward the 0 side.  It's not about how good you play, it's about how popular you are, and how much money you can make from your popularity.  John Petrucci is a great guitarist, but not enough people like prog metal to make him as rich as The Edge.   ",
