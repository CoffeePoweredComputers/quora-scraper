            "answer_text": "What are some songs that could be both secular and religious? Well, you didn\u2019t specify what religion, but I\u2019ll assume you mean something within the Judeo-Christian tradition, and written in English. Lots of folk songs, including popular \u201cNegro spirituals,\u201d as well as many \u201cprotest\u201d songs of the 1960s, and many country/bluegrass songs, are at home in both religious and secular settings. The Jewish tradition also has produced a variety of popular songs with a spiritual component, or based on Biblical verses, such as Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHalleluia,\u201d Debbie Friedman\u2019s \u201cNot by might,\u201d and others. \u201cIf I had my way\u201d (story of Samson) \u201cDem bones\u201d (Ezekiel\u2019s vision) \u201cFreedom\u201d (exodus and redemption) \u201cWe shall not be moved\u201d (steadfastness in faith) \u2018Let my people go / Go down Moses\u201d (exodus and redemption) \u201cOh, Mary don\u2019t you weep\u201d (crossing of the reed sea) \u201cJoshua fought the battle of Jericho\u201d \u201cMichael row the boat ashore\u201d \u201cChildren go where I send thee\u201d\u201cGit on board, little children\u201d \u201cHard times come again no more\u201d \u201dGoing over Jordan\u201d \u201cSwing low, sweet chariot\u201d \u201cGoing home\u201d \u201cWhither thou goest\u201d (story of Ruth) \u201cThe wedding song\u201d \u201cJesus met the woman at the well\u201d \u201cBlowing in the wind\u201d \u201cTurn, turn, turn\u201d \u201cWhere have all the flowers gone\u201d \u201cIf I had a hammer\u201d \u201cKumbaya\u201d \u201cThis train (don\u2019t carry no gamblers)\u201d \u201cBy the waters of Babylon\u201d \u201cDaniel prayed\u201d \u201cWill the circle be unbroken\u201d \u201cHeaven\u2019s bright shore\u201d \u201cAmazing grace\u201d \u201cSimple gifts\u201d \u201cHe ain\u2019t heavy, he\u2019s my brother\u201d \u201cI saw the light\u201d \u201cKeep on the sunny side\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just a poor wayfaring stranger\u201d \u201cSometimes I feel like a motherless child\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t it rain\u201d \u201cDay by day\u201d \u201cWalk that lonesome valley\u201d \u201cHow can I keep from singing\u201d \u201cLight one candle\u201d \u201cLord of the dance\u201d I\u2019m sure there are plenty more.
