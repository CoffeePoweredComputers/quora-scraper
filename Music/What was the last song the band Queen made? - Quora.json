            "answer_text": "There are several potential answers to this question, depending on your standpoint. I haven't included songs which were merely remixed after Freddie's death, but there are still a few candidates. The last song recorded by Queen, with Freddie Mercury present for the recording session:This was 'Mother Love', recorded mostly in May 1991, with Freddie's final vocal recorded on May 22, 1991. This was probably Freddie's last ever vocal recording session. You can find out more about it in my answer to a similar question: Phil Chapman's answer to What was the last song that Queen recorded with Freddie Mercury? \u2018Mother Love\u2019 appeared on the album Made in Heaven, released in 1995. The last song recorded by Queen, with Freddie Mercury on the recording, but with some of the recording completed after his death:'I Can't Live With You' has a mildly chequered history. It was written by Brian May for inclusion on his debut solo album, but ended up being recorded as a Queen track for the 1991 Innuendo album. It was remixed for the 1997 Queen Rocks compilation, with a new introduction and additional new instrumentation recorded, including guitars by Brian May and drums by Roger Taylor. This later version was titled 'I Can't Live With You (1997 Rocks Retake)'. The last song recorded by Queen, as Queen, but without Freddie's involvement:This song also appears on the 1997 Queen Rocks compilation. \u2018No-One But You (Only The Good Die Young)' was written by Brian May as a tribute to Freddie Mercury and recorded by the surviving members of Queen in 1997. The Queen Rocks sleeve notes include the statement \"Queen are: John Deacon, Brian May, Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor. 'No-One But You' is of course another story\". The last song recorded by Queen, as 'Queen +':After successful tours in 2005 and 2006, billed as \u2018Queen + Paul Rodgers\u2019, Brian May, Roger Taylor and Paul Rodgers (former lead singer of Free and Bad Company) decided to write and record some new material. The resulting album, The Cosmos Rocks, was recorded at Roger Taylor's home studio, The Priory, in Surrey, England. Sessions were disjointed, starting towards the end of 2007 and finishing in late summer the following year. John Deacon chose not to be involved in the project (he hadn't been present on the 2005-2006 tours either) and bass guitar duties were shared between Brian May and Paul Rodgers. In fact, all vocal and instrumental duties on the album were performed by May, Taylor and Rodgers; the only exception was a guest backing vocal contribution on the track 'C-lebrity' by Foo Fighters drummer and Queen super fan Taylor Hawkins. There doesn\u2019t appear to be a published account of the final track to be recorded for this album, so it\u2019s one of sixteen, including the fourteen standard tracks, plus the iTunes exclusive track \u2018Runaway\u2019 and the unreleased \u2018Take Love\u2019. The last of these was performed live on the 2006 Queen + Paul Rodgers US tour but didn\u2019t feature on The Cosmos Rocks. Several accounts suggest it was recorded but not finished, possibly because the musicians were unhappy with it. Perhaps its unfinished state makes \u2018Take Love\u2019 the strongest candidate for being the last song recorded by Queen + Paul Rodgers. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean. The last song Freddie Mercury recorded was Mother Love. He never actually finished, so Brian May sang the last verse. While making their last album, \u201cMade in Heaven\u201d, the surviving three members of the band added their instruments to vocals Freddie recorded before his death, as well as used vocals from Mercury\u2019s solo album (Mr. Bad Guy), and added Queen arrangements around it. The surviving members recorded \u201cNo One but You\u201d in tribute to Freddie after his death, but some do not count this; though all living members of the band participated. Then, Brian and Roger joined with Paul Rodgers to record \u201cSay it\u2019s not True\u201d and a couple other songs as \u201cQueen + Paul Rodgers\u201d. (As John Deacon did not participate and it was post-Freddie many don\u2019t count this). In my opinion: \u201cNo one but you\u201d counts, and was Queen\u2019s last song. ",
