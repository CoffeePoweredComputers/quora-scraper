            "answer_text": "The only reason I don\u2019t just say Electric Ladyland, and leave it at that, is because that album is not the best place to start if you are just getting into Jimi. Electric Ladyland is typically the favorite album of people that have already gotten deeply into Are you Experienced? and/or Axis. Actually if you haven\u2019t listened to them, at a cursory glance, you might think that those first two albums are stronger on a track-by-track basis. You wouldn\u2019t be wrong either, every song on the first two albums are gems, rock classics in every sense of the word. The albums are also sequenced in a very straightforward rock album way also. Very radio-friendly. Every track on Electric Ladyland is also a gem, however the sequence is much less user-friendly, and harder to take in if you are not already a fan of the first two albums. The two tracks that are perhaps considered to be the most epic to fans are Voodoo Chile (last track of side 1) and 1983. The former track is raw blues with a pickup band (including Jack Casady and Steve Winwood), recorded late night in the studio, one-take no overdubs. One of the best live in the studio tracks I\u2019ve ever heard from any band, ever. I still get chills listening to this so many years later, even though I know pretty much every note and nuance of this performance. 1983 is hard to describe as a track, and even harder, without the context of his other work, and of the year 1968 in general. To me, this is the most full exploration of Jimi\u2019s talents of songwriting and studio wizardry, all the while exploring the depths of his psyche and creativity. I love every track on this album, but over the years I have come to think of it as 4 extraordinary EPs that hold up fantastically as a single album, but that are too difficult to fully take in during a single listening session. So yes, start with the first two albums and enjoy them in the light of some of the best rock albums ever created, take a pause and spend a week of your life getting into Electric Ladyland. One thing I will guarantee, comparing him to another guitarist will drop from your radar, and fast. Also, as to his later albums. I love some of them, but with the except of Band of Gypsies , they are all posthumous, and very few of the tracks were completed to Jimi\u2019s standards. Band of Gypsies is also great, and essential to a fan, but flawed enough to make it not such a great place to start. ",

            "answer_text": "The executive summary: arguably the best album in rock history (the American version) \u2026 and one that changed my life as much as \u201cMeet The Beatles\u201d (side one) \u2026 is \u2026 Are You Experienced \u2026 his first album, released May 1967. Is it actually possible for an album to consist of ALL great songs? This one does IMO. Going through song by song \u2026 I have to start at the end, with the last track \u2026 \u201cAre You Experienced\u201d \u2026 arguably the greatest song in rock history (it\u2019s my personal favorite \u2026 maybe I\u2019ll ask for it to be played at my funeral lol) , the most pioneering (with, say, the Beatles\u2019 \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever\u201d and \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d) \u2026 as great an ending song as \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d certainly, which are IMO the two best endings ever, along with the last minute of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cThe End\u201d (\u2026 \u201cand, in the end \u2026.\u201d) Back to Side One, track by track \u2026 \u201cPurple Haze\u201d \u2026 Are you kidding me? How good can a rock song be? It\u2019s been killed by over-covering by party bands because it\u2019s a simple song, but still \u2026 \u201cManic Depression\u201d \u2026 see my comment on \u201cPurple Haze\u201d \u201cHey Joe\u201d \u2026 my own high school/party band covered Jimi\u2019s slow, killer, version of this, with me playing the lead on an electric violin \u2026 but I digress. Once again, how damn good can a cover version of someone else\u2019s song be? Only cover-song that\u2019s close IMO: Beatles\u2019/Lennon\u2019s \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d \u201cLove or Confusion:\u201d underrated song \u2026 hey, check out my good friend (from the old days, traipsing the ashrams of northern India together) Eric Johnson\u2019s cover of it:  \u201cMay This Be Love:\u201d Magical, mystical track \u2026 foreshadows those great, sad tracks on \u201cAxis Bold as Love\u201d \u201cI Don\u2019t Live Today:\u201d the finale of Side One is not the greatest track on the album, but they can\u2019t all be - and it\u2019s the ONLY track I\u2019d say that about. Side Two \u201cThe Wind Cries Mary\u201d \u2026 are you friggin kidding me? Is this the best ballad ever writtten, or just one of the Top Five? \u201cFire:\u201d see the comment on Purple Haze/Manis Depression ... it\u2019s a trio! \u201cThird Stone from the Sun:\u201d experimental track extraordinarie, ala \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d from The Beatles\u2019 Revolver album. \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d \u2026 are you friggin kidding me? See my comment on \u201cPurple Haze\u201d .. now we have a quad! \u201cAre You Experienced\u201d \u2026 heaven. ",
