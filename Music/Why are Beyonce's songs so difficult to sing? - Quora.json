            "answer_text": "That is because they are just written that way in order to ensure that her great vocals stand out throughout her songs as showcased in tunes such as Love On Top and Listen, which are, in my opinion some of her best recorded singing.  Beyonce is very well-known to have an extremely agile voice as well as a monstrous vocal range that spans greater than 3 octaves (based on Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles voice analysis from Range Place, her sung range is about A2-E6). This enables her to be able to execute riffs and melismas with ease, even within her higher register, which is a very difficult region to perform within even for experienced singers. If one can have a voice like Beyonce's and sing very well with it, then why not write songs that can showcase the best of your vocal traits? :) I personally am not into R&B as much, but I highly adore Beyonce as a vocalist, and for her singing skills alone, she deserves all the plaudits in the world.

            "answer_text": "Beyonce's songs are more difficult to sing because they are written that way, to showcase her vocal skill.  They are technically complex songs that not everyone can do.   Beyonce has great natural talent and is very well-trained as a vocalist.  She has the capability to sing songs that require great control of the voice and breath, span a substantial vocal range, and require vocal agility.  She has a warm, velvety, womanly voice, with a lovely quality to her entire range.  She's great at performing, bringing emotion and connection with others to her singing both in-studio and live.  She has presence, charisma, and is genuine. She's irreplacable, even if you can manage to sing her songs. ",
