            "answer_text": "For me, the best song of BP is Whistle. Though it doesn\u2019t have lyrical quality, the aesthetics of the music video and its catchy tune makes it my all time blackpink favourite. Stay is an underrated song that deserves more appreciation. Their worst song is Kill This Love. Although it is a catchy song and has a colouful MV, it feels like a cut and paste of so many catchy songs. I didn\u2019t like Jennie\u2019s and Lisa\u2019s raps. It sounded like a poor imitation Cardi B\u2019s rap. I felt like it was released with the sole purpose of fulfilling the fan\u2019s demand for a new song. Being irritated with the fan\u2019s demand they just made a song to make them popular in the west knowing that regardless of its quality, the fans would suck it up as usual and would remain silent for a while.

            "answer_text": "For me Playing With Fire is the best because I love the vibe of it and the instrumentals, the aesthetically pleasing music video only makes it better for me. I also really love Forever Young and Stay. My least favorite is Kill This Love because it just\u2026 isn\u2019t anything that special? It sounds like a recycled version of Ddu-du-ddu-du and over-marketed k-pop at it\u2019s finest. And I still don\u2019t hate it, I just am not big on it. ",
