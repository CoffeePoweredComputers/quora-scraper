            "answer_text": "You'll need a client. A client is someone with a budget, who needs advertising to promote their company/ product/ service and who thinks you can do a better job of it than any of the millions of others out there with a proven track record. So you need to find a way of convincing this client that you are the best, or that you are the one they know and who is available with the necessary knowledge and skills. You convince them by showing them work, case studies, industry awards etc which generate the feeling they are in safe hands. So have you this work, these case studies etc? When Charles and Maurice Saatchi started in the 70\u2019s, there is a story (true or otherwise) that they showed a potential client around their fledgling agency, which was full of busy workers. The client, pleased to see that this start-up was indeed a functioning advertising agency with staff and clients, awarded them their large account. Except all the \u2018staff\u2019 were actors, hired by the hour to make the agency seem bustling. I have no way of knowing if this is true, but it wouldn't surprise me. Agencies are often unscrupulous. But to pull something like that off nowadays would be virtually impossible. Stick to being honest, authentic and being what you appear to be. ",

You will just need to formulate a proprietorship or a private limited company. Do the registration, bank account opening and you\u2019re all set. Next would be to get the team. If you\u2019re an advertising professional already, you will know how to go about hiring or let me know I will detail it out for you. Think of a brand-name for yourself. A name that is available across all web and social platforms. Get your website,. Emailers done and lo..you\u2019re ready to go. Get in touch with your clients..present them with what you can do for them. And the rest will follow. However, if you need more hand-holding, I know someone who started her own agency a few years back and is extremely enthusiastic about helping others. Get in touch with her on Linkedin. All the best for your endeavors :) ",

Maybe even easier, because you don\u2019t need any special permission or training. Running the agency is the more difficult part. The way we did it (I now own an ad agency of 40 people in Athens, Greece) is by knowing our craft in one thing and selling this to make a name for ourselves. Our thing was digital, and even though we\u2019ve now done more than 15 TV commercials in the last 12 months, digital is at the heart of everything we propose. ",

Parts of it can be outsourced)Production (the ones producing what the creatives think of. Can be outsourced)Media Buying/Planning (usually this is outsourced to a media buying agency)These are the absolute minimum requirements. So in order to build the Advertising Agency you need someone facing the client and handling the day to day and a creative team. Do your math. See how much it costs to rack up a team, office space, equipment etc. Secure the funds and start looking for clients. If you don\u2019t have revenue after the amount of time you agency burns all its funds close up shop. ",
