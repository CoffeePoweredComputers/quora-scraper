            "answer_text": "Question: How realistic is Andy\u2019s escape in The Shawshank Redemption? How did he know what was behind the wall? How was he sure there would be a pipe that fits his size and has no grating at the end? Not very realistic at all. Why? The sewer pipe - Human waste decays and creates a toxic gas called hydrogen sulfide. It can overcome you within seconds and kills you in minutes. Basically, when he broke open the sewage pipe he should have been almost immediately overcome and died well before he got inside. If he indeed made it inside the pipe then he would have passed out before he crawled a few feet. He would never have made it to the end of the pipe.He didn\u2019t know what was behind the wall - It was a \u201clucky guess\u201d and it could have resulted in him wasting months or year chipping away at a wall which was thicker than he planned.He could have discovered blueprints of the prison\u2019s piping system - However, as I know from years working at plants and refineries, what\u2019s on the prints isn\u2019t what\u2019s always in the wall and in the ground. Not being a technical person by trade, Dufresne could have made even a slight mistake and found himself breaking into a water main leading to his death by drowning,While modern prison systems would using gratings for their drainage discharge (Sewage discharge cannot be piped directly into bodies of water any longer in the Western world) they probably wouldn't have done so in a 1960s era prison in Maine - The costs of installing and maintaining such a minor piece of infrastructure would far outweighed its need. Basically, no one likely thought anyone would crawl through a sewage pipe to escape from Shawshank and so nobody bothered to order grating over the discharge end.Decent film. Improbable ending. Played too often on cable television. ",

            "answer_text": "It is realistic in the fact that it took nearly two decades of scraping through a wall with a tiny rock hammer and disposing of bits of that wall in the prison yard during exercise time each day. Now, it's possible that Andy had access to blueprints of the prison; it appeared he had ready access to the warden's office and might have come across diagrams of the inner wall there, so he had knowledge of the size, direction, and final destination of the pipes in the wall next to his cell. And if there was a grate at the end, Andy could have kicked it away, with the adrenaline of a desperate man.I find it harder to believe that in all that time, no other prisoner heard Andy digging in the wall at night (Andy had a \"one bunk Hilton\" but he still had inmates right next door) , the posters he used to cover the hole never fluttered free and exposed the hole while he was at a meal or at his prison job, etc. He got lucky that way.
