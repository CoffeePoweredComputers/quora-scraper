            "answer_text": "Though, this is totally based on personal taste. But, I've seen some answers mentioning One Direction and similar artists. I won\u2019t say that these artists lack talent, but since how long their songs are around, 2 years, 4 years ? You can\u2019t judge whether a song is worth to be mentioned in this list in such a short span. Anyway, this is my personal opinion. Choosing 20 songs out of the million I've heard is a very tough task. I'm selecting these songs based on the number of times I've heard and can still hear them. Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven.Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody.Bee Gees - Stayin\u2019 Alive.Tool - Vicarious.Metallica - Unforgiven II.Porcupine Tree - Arriving Somewhere but not here.Pearl Jam - Alive.Guns N\u2019 Roses - November Rain.The Eagles - Hotel California.R.E.M - Loosing my Religion.Oasis - Wonderwall.John Lenon - Imagine.The Beatles - Let it be.Eric Clapton - Layla.Eminem - Loose Yourself.Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb.Rolling Stones - Gimme Shelter.Nirvana - Smells like teen spirit.Lynyrd Skynyrd - Free Bird.The White Stripes - Seven Nation Army.These are not in order, these are the ones I've heard maximum. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t listen to Pop, EDM or any other genre, just that these are meant to stay with you forever. I\u2019ll mention a few more songs that a person shouldn't miss. The Smashing Pumpkins - Cherub Rock.Rage Against the Machine - Killing in the name.Blue \u00d6yster Cult - Burnin\u2019 for you.Iron Maiden - The number of the beast.Daft Punk - Around the World.",

            "answer_text": "I listen to all the genres and giving you a mixed bag in no particular order per se. Depending upon what genre you like, you can have your picks: [I would suggest you try Pop music first. In this list try songs by Backstreet Boys first. Songs like Bohemian Rhapsody and Stairway to Heaven take time to be appreciated well enough.] 1. November Rain by Guns N' Roses.2. Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen.3. The Rain Must Fall (Live at El Morro version) by Yanni.4. Felitsa (Live at El Morro version) by Yanni.5. Beautiful by Eminem.6. Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin.7. Show Me The Meaning of Being Lonely by Backstreet Boys.8. Siberia by Backstreet Boys.9. Unmistakable by Backstreet Boys.10. Love Thing by Joe Satriani.11. Flying in a Blue Dream by Joe Satriani.12. Heart & Soul by Kenny G.13. The Moment by Kenny G.14. Hotel California by Eagles. I've added my top picks from my fav genres. With Queen and Guns N' Roses and Led Zeppelin you get Rock, with BSB you get Pop, with Kenny G you get Jazz, Joe Satriani for instrumental rock (electric guitar) and Yanni for music beyond boundaries. I may add a few more later. :) Edit 1: Since I recommended pop genre, here are some songs you should try right away: 1. As Long As You Love Me2. Quit Playing Games3. I Still...4. I Want It That Way5. Shape of My Heart6. Drowning All by Backstreet Boys.Try these first. The list I mentioned first is more like the top songs. It'd take time to appreciate them. Start with these 6 first and discover more similar artists like Westlife, Michael Learn to Rock etc. For now Backstreet Boys would alone provide you with enough songs for a month. Hope this helps. Happy listening. :) ",
