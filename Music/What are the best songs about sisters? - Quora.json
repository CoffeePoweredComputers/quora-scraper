            "answer_text": "Hmmm, does this question refer to nuns, brother- sister songs, sister- sister songs, or sisters as in the sisterhood. Nuns. This is a pretty small genre. I'll go with Dominique by the Singing Nun. This is purely nostalgia. Just don't translate it into english.  Having purged, scourged and cleaned after that, what comes next? Brother-sister I'm going with Stevie Ray, this maybe simply a reaction to Dominique.  Now I'm feeling better, whats up next? Sister-Sister. Two Little Sisters by Carly Simon.  Finally the Sisterhood. Comes down to a choice between two. You pick.   At last a better nun genre song.  ",
