            "answer_text": "After listening to them again over the past few weeks, I\u2019d have to say the first ten albums by The Beatles. Unless you lived through those days, it\u2019s almost impossible to understand how much these guys revolutionised contemporary music. Almost any song on any of those albums could have been a stand-alone smash hit & each one sounds as good today as it did back in the 1960s. The Beatles didn\u2019t record an album with perhaps one or two good songs with the rest being included as fillers, every song was great. Every album was more experimental & more progressive than the one before it. No-one pushed & exceeded the musical & artistic boundaries more than The Beatles. Mono albums were recorded as mono albums & not then converted into stereo. They sound the way they\u2019re meant to for mono recordings. Likewise, stereo albums were recorded as stereo albums. Some of their early albums were issued in both stereo & mono formats & both were purposely engineered to get the most out of their respective technologies. I don\u2019t think any other band did that. They were the tightest band of any of their contemporary bands & still sound tighter today than many bands that followed them. Their vocals & harmonies were outstanding. The song-writing skills of Lennon & McCartney are still unparalleled while their original cover songs were also superb (how many rock bands can claim four part harmonies without over-dubbing & while playing their instruments?!). They were all extremely accomplished musicians who could play each others\u2019 parts if needed (even Ringo could play guitar & piano as well as sing & harmonise). George Harrison was a superb lead guitarist whose many solos sound different on every song on every album. On the early albums he was only given 10\u201315 seconds (& sometimes less) & one take to perform his solos & never failed to deliver the goods. Remember, there was only one string gauge available then (heavy!) & only one brand (Black Diamond) yet he still manged to bend strings in ways that others at the time could only dream of doing. An often unnoticed aspect of their early recordings was their extensive use of acoustic guitar & their use of 7th & 9th chords (particularly when John was playing rhythm guitar), which is something that continued throughout their recording career. Again, this was not common among other bands at that time with perhaps the exception of The Rolling Stones. They sounded just as good \u2018live\u2019 as they did on their recordings. This is an amazing feat considering that until Vox built them special 100 watt amps for touring, they used 30 watt amps (the exact same ones they used in the studio & which they often carried with them by hand) & two microphones for the three guitarists/vocalists and one for Ringo. They didn\u2019t use a PA system so each mic went through one of the guitar amps & they rarely used any special effects other than the reverb & tremolo on their amps - even on many of their early recordings. Ringo\u2019s drums were never miked up (not even in the studio), yet they still sounded great. Their first album, \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d was recorded in one day & most songs were completed in one or two takes. The album tracks appear in the order in which they were recorded. There were very few overdubs & John Lennon was suffering from a serious bout of the flu throughout the session, which is why he left \u201cTwist & Shout\u201d to the very end of the day. Keith Richards once told Paul McCartney that what set The Beatles apart from other bands was that unlike those other bands (including The Rolling Stones), they had four accomplished vocalists & four musicians who could play just about every other instrument the others could play. I could go on, but I\u2019ll rest my case now. ",

            "answer_text": "My turn. I am going to list the albums that shaped MY rock n roll. I\u2019m sure other people have had different experiences. But if you are interested in the genre and need some reference, these are hard to beat. First is the Vanilla Fudge. You keep me hanging on. At Christmas in my sophomore year in high school. my girlfriend gave me Donovan\u2019s Wear Your Love Like Heaven. I gave her You Keep Me Hanging ON. You figure it out.  Then it was the Turtles. Today, perhaps it looks like this was a sell out. No, it wasn\u2019t. I believe this group was HIGHLY underrated. And besides, they later became Flo and Eddie and sang with Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention. How\u2019s that for not square?  One of the original inventors of the \u201cheavy metal\u201d sound - a term derived from the name of the band, Iron Butterfly. Heavily influential.  The Who and their album Sellout. Who can beat Maryann and her Shaky Hands? Seriously, this one is a wonderful imaginative piece of work that contained the hit, \u201cI Can See for Miles\u201d  And yes, of course, The Beatles. I love many of their albums, but the one which influenced me the most initially was Rubber Soul. Songs with so much more to them, yet presented in a manner not foreign to my ears. Revolver was a break through in so many ways, but it took more work from the listener. Rubber Soul was insidious.  Then this band, first known as the Chicago Transit Authority and later just as Chicago. They had their own sound (along with Blood, Sweat and Tears) and a plethora of hits to go with it. Great introductory double album. Suddenly playing a trombone became cool again.  Neil Young. After the Gold Rush. He did it all on this album in his own quirky manner. Lots of ballads, but there is no substitute for Southern Man for absolutely rockin\u2019 out.  Then another new rock sound emerged with Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Their first hit was \u201cLucky Man\u201d - but the group\u2019s groove was really their longer album cuts. Groups like ELP and Yes spawned FM radio station listenership because they would play a fifteen minute track. Wasn\u2019t done on AM radio.  Can\u2019t forget Hendrix. Revolutionized rock guitar. Outstanding in just a three man group, since Jimmy could play two parts - sometimes three - all at the same time. Listen to \u201cCan You See Me\u201d and let it rock you socks off.  And for my 10th pick, I select Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s \u201cThere\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On\u201d - this album had many firsts, but for the listening value alone it is in my top ten. Dance to the Music, baby. I think this is Sly\u2019s zenith.  I guess I replied to this question to show how much diversity there is in rock music. I could have made ten more lists just like this with all different artisits and albums. The point is there is no definitive. Many roots to this amazing tree. ",
