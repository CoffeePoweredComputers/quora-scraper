            "answer_text": "Per Wikipedia , Starr is credited as the sole composer of two Beatles songs: \"Octopus's Garden\" and \"Don't Pass Me By\". He is credited as a co-writer of \"What Goes On\", \"Flying\" and \"Dig It\". I believe \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d is well-known and successful. I\u2019ve know the song \u201cDon\u2019t Pass Me By\u2019, but I went to see Ringo\u2019s All Starr Band 3 times ,so I may think more of his song are famous . See the article. Ringo Starr - Wikipedia You can go to the Billboard website or wikipedia probably to see how high in the charts these songs got. However, I generally only see data on the album Abbey Road which contains \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d and not the song as single. ",

Octopus\u2019s Garden was actually covered by the Muppets who used to sing it on Sesame Street, although their version was obviously not as good as the Beatles\u2019! ",

Don\u2019t Pass Me By (The Beatles) and Octopus\u2019 Garden (Abbey Road) were credited solely to Ringo. Flying (Magical Mystery Tour) was credited to all 4 Beatles. Obviously, it goes without saying that, even if Ringo hadn\u2019t written a note of music, his contributions were an essential part of what made the Beatles music so great (although the handful of songs which eitger featured no drummer or had McCartney on sticks were pretty good, too) ",

The rest of the song was written with varying degrees of George Harrison\u2019s help, depending on the source: George was either Ringo\u2019s co writer, or George finished the song for Ringo. ",
