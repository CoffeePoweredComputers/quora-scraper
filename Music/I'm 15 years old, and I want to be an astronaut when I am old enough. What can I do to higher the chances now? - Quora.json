The US Air Force Academy or Annapolis seems to breed a lot of astronauts.Graduate school is a must. Again, something in the STEM field. Medicine is also another field to look into.Learn a foreign language. Due to our program shutdown and the need to use the Soyuz platform, learning Russian would be helpful.Check out astronaut profiles on NASA\u2019s webpage. Not only read their biographies, but also check out their Twitter feed. They would be the best mentors to get you underway.Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Call NASA and ask someone in Human Resources that question. Even ask to speak to an astronaut. The worse you can hear is a no. Ask them who else might be good people to talk to about it. Just don\u2019t start locally. They will eventually refer you to your local colleges or some of the ones with heavy aerospace degrees. You asked to late to check out their space camp. That would have been fun! ",
