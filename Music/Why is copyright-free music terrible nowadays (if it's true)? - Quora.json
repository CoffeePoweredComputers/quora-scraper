If it was good enough to sell so people would pay for it, it would have been copyrighted and marketed and sold and made some money for the authors. When it\u2019s amateur and not really made with the idea that it should be sold, it generally is not really very good music. It\u2019s kind of an economic Darwin\u2019s survival of the fittest. Only the music that is the best will be paid for. The rest will languish, where its only chance to be heard is for it to be offered for free. ",
