This is not something you should do unless you\u2019re absolutely certain. For more information, check out this PDF published by Berklee\u2019s own Career Development Center. It\u2019s extremely informative. ",

            "answer_text": "Berklee is a truly wonderful music school - especially if the student takes full advantage of the knowledge, joy and wisdom they'll find in the faculty and their fellow students. For me, I hired a band on a cruise ship after leaving Berklee in 1983, played with The Ringling Bros Circus, The Ice Capades, Gladys Knight and the Pips, The Spinners, O'Jays, and others, and taught lessons in a Texas schools system. Since then, I've played at the Kennedy Center, and many other notable venues.I made a career in Telecommunications (as it is more suitable to me from many perspectives), while continuing to study and play music since I left Berklee! Many of my classmates (Diana Krall, Terri Lynne Carrington, Franck Amsallem, Tony Gorruso) have made great careers in music since then; some (like those above) are (in varying degrees) famous, but many are not, even though they are exceptional musicians. Musicians make music their whole lives, regardless of where they go to school. The one thing that matters to us all is continuing to learn about, love, and play/write/rehearse/share/listen to music in a way we never would have if we hadn't been to Berklee. ",
