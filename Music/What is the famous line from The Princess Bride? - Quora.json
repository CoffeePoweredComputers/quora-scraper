He\u2019s only mostly dead You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is 'never get involved in a land war in Asia' - but only slightly less well-known is this: 'Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line!' Inconcievable!! You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while. I\u2019m not a witch, I\u2019m your wife! A popular line to make into a meme is: Alright, now let\u2019s see, where were we? Oh, yes. In the pit of despair. And of course, the wedding ceremony. Mawwage. Mawwage is what bwings us togevah today. Mawwage, dat bwessed awwangement. Dat dweam wivvin a dweam. Wuv, twue wuv wiww fowwow you fowevah.
