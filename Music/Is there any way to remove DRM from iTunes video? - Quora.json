            "answer_text": "DRM stands for Digital Rights Management and it is now (spring 2002) the hot topic among content owners and technology companies alike. Apple uses M4V to encode video files, such as TV episodes, movies, and music videos, in its iTunes Store. The copyright of M4V files may be protected by using Apple's FairPlay DRM copy protection. To play a protected M4V file, the computer needs to be authorized (using iTunes) with the account that was used to purchase the video. You can play iTunes protected videos on iPhone, iPad, iPod and Apple TV. If you want to play them on non-apple devices, firstly you should get rid of the copy protection. M4V Converter Plus is a professional iTunes DRM Removal software (Mac Version and Windows Version). With it, you can remove DRM from iTunes movies, Rentals and music videos by converting them to common video files, including MP4, MOV, AVI, FLV, etc. View the detailed tutorial of how to remove DRM protection from iTunes videos  ",
