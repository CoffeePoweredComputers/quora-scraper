I am not the only traveler Who has not repaid his debt I've been searching for a trail to follow again Take me back to the night we met  And then I can tell myself What the hell I'm supposed to do And then I can tell myself Not to ride along with you I had all and then most of you  Some and now none of you Take me back to the night we met  I don't know what I'm supposed to do Haunted by the ghost of you Oh, take me back to the night we met When the night was full of terrors And your eyes were filled with tears When you had not touched me yet Oh, take me back to the night we met I had all and then most of you  Some and now none of you Take me back to the night we met I don't know what I'm supposed to do Haunted by the ghost of you Take me back to the night we met. Play it at night and u will see souls next to u listening and crying...... What a masterpiece!! Lord Huron - The Night We Met (Lyric Video) Sheikh Mubashir ",

LADY IN RED - Chris De Burgh It\u2019s more that the song reminds me of a certain time rather than the song itself, if that makes sense. And then there\u2019s this:  Elvis Presley - Can't Help Falling In Love It\u2019s pretty much a given that I\u2019ll drop everything and dance with my lovely wife (no matter where we are) if this song comes on.
