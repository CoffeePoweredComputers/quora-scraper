            "answer_text": "You will occasionally hear guitar shop heroes say \u201cwhy is [the whammy bar] called a tremolo when it should really be called a vibrato?\u201d Heed not these blowhards, and do not join their ranks. Music existed for centuries before guitars did, and the Italian words tremolo and vibrato have been in use since the Renaissance. Vibrato refers to fluctuation of pitch on an instrument that produces continuous pitches (e.g. a piano cannot produce vibrato but a fretless violin can.) Tremolo comes from the Italian word for \u201ctremble\u201d and can refer to a wide variety of effects (rapid fluctuation of volume, or rapid, repeated plucking of a single pitch, or trilling between discrete pitches.) In the right hands, a whammy bar-equipped guitar could certainly produce a tremolo effect. Listen to say, Jeff Beck\u2019s \u201c\u2019Cause We\u2019ve Ended as Lovers\u201d from Blow by Blow and tell me whether the effect he produces with his whammy-equipped Stratocaster is \u201ctrembling\u201d i.e. tremolo. What about a Floyd Rose or Kahler style whammy that can produce Van Halen style \u201cdive bombs?\u201d That\u2019s not vibrato OR tremolo; it\u2019s more like portamento. Should it be called a portamento bar? ",

Vibrato = \u201cwobble\u201d in pitch of a note that emulates sound of human voice. Reason the two get confused is because Leo Fender (who, by the way, didn\u2019t actually play guitar) decided to call the vibrato arm on his guitar a \u201ctremolo\u201d. Name stuck.
