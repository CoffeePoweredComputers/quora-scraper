            "answer_text": "It's weird to think about this. It's confusing. Do the talk shows pay the celebrities? Do the celebrities pay the talk shows? Is there no pay at all and the actor or performer just benefits from the exposure? How does it work? It is a common misconception, but no, the talk show does not rake out large sums of money to pay its guests. Actors on talk shows have their accommodations met, and they receive a stipend for their appearance. When I appeared on Jay Leno's Tonight Show, they flew me out to California from the east coast, gave me passes to Universal Studios (because I was a kid, I would imagine), put me up in a hotel, made sure my car service, meals, hair and makeup were taken care of, stocked the green room with stuff I could eat and drink, and gave me some really sweet swag baskets to leave with. Everything was taken care of. Same with my appearance on Late Night with Conan O' Brian; they took care of all of my accommodations - which was cheaper because I was living in New York at the time and promoting a film that was shot in New York and directed by Spike Lee, a New York director. (That's great booking on their part!) Both these appearances were for late night shows; they give you spending money for food and personal needs, flight, hotel, car, hair and makeup (and I hear, sometimes clothing) accommodations. In addition, the Screen Actor's Guild & American Federation of Television and Radio Actors (SAG & AFTRA) jointly stipulate that any union members appearing on these shows must be paid a certain amount per appearance. I believe it's about $750 right now in May, 2015. So yes, everyone gets accommodations and this baseline fee as their pay. The accommodations can vary, but the bottom line is simply providing the resources to fly the person out and get them ready for a great interview - right before the film or other production they're in comes out. We're used to hearing about salaries for actors and celebrities being in the high hundred thousands/ millions (yes, even for television. Actors are badass enough to rock 1 million+ per episode salaries!) Those are performance contracts. In daytime and late night guest spots, bidding wars for high \"appearance fees\" would demolish the quick turnaround logistics of talk show production and the long-established industry tradition that your \"appearance fee\" is really just accommodations + stipend. Oprah herself often explained that she never paid anybody to be on her show. The Daily Show also follows this too; no pay for its guests. For both you, the actor, and the talk show itself, the real value is you up there blabbing beautifully about your upcoming project. I use the term stipend for the SAG/AFTRA minimum because this union compensation they're given for late night and/or daytime entertainment shows pretty much pales in comparison to how they are usually paid for their work. So, if they can't negotiate a fat appearance fee, why do celebrity actors even do late night / talk show appearances? It's part of the commitment -- When you work on a movie, part of the contract negotiations include going over stipulations about promotional appearances. It's kind of like the post-game press conference(s) of the acting world.To win over the people -- Publicity is such a powerful element of your career as an actor. If you can cultivate genuine intrigue about your work, more people will go to see it. If you can rock that publicity, it can lead to more work. That means more of you getting to fabricate and then exist inside the soul of another human being as a job. So it's a win - win - win.Role Reversal -- Actors have one of the few professions where your job is almost always to be someone else at work! It can be incredibly refreshing as an actor to have a camera on you...as yourself!Fun, dude! Duh! -- It's fun! (It actually really is fun, though) : )",

When a person is considered so newsworthy that a major talk show books him or her, the publicity that such an appearance generates is often payment enough. Usually, national shows pay your plane fare and meals and put you up in a nice hotel. But as I said, it\u2019s often the experience itself that leads to positive things\u2014 and is worth far more than receiving a check. That said, regular entertainers (like a studio orchestra, or a big-name guest performer), or the people who are part of the show\u2019s staff (like the folks who work behind the scenes to keep the show running smoothly) do get paid for their work.

You\u2019ll rarely see someone go on a late-night/daytime show unless they\u2019re promoting something. The one exception to this could be politicians, but even they are promoting something such as legislation or their own or someone else's political campaign. Shows could provide certain accommodations but rarely cut out big checks to celebrities. If the celebrity is promoting a movie, tv-show, music album, or some other creative art, it could have been written into their contract they sign with the studio stating that they must do press (go on late night or daytime shows) to promote the project. That\u2019s the standard, the ellen show could be different though \u2014 if I\u2019m wrong, tell me. It is possible shows may pay celebrities if they\u2019re coming on to just be there and not promote anything. ",

Promoting whatever project they're in is built into their contract with the studio, so they don't get anything additional on that end. But talk shows make money from advertisers based on audience size, and audiences tune in to see stars, so guests on daytime and nighttime talk shows are paid accordingly. Also, as members of SAG/AFTRA, the screen actors union, they cannot appear on a major network without being paid the union minimum (though most are paid far more than that.) ",

This is why musicians cost so much to hire, you have to make it worth their while not to work on another album or perform at a concert where they'd likely make much more money. ",
