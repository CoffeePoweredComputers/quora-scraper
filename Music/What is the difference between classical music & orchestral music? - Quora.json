            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A Short answer: Classical music refers to an style of music and orchestral refers to the type of instruments used. Not all the classical music was written for the orchestra, so we have piano sonatas, string quartets, works for violin and piano, etc. Longer answer: Strictly talking, classical music refers to a very specific period in music, from the middle of XVIIIth century to early XIXth (from 1750 to 1830). That includes Haydn, Mozart and early Beethoven and their contemporaries. In that case we talk about the classical period. This music can be liturgical or secular, but it has some characteristics: it was produced in the western tradition and use the tonal harmonic system. There are many other technical features in terms of structure, texture and melody. But it\u2019s common that this same term is used to talk about the common practice period. In that case we are talking about the music produced from 1550 to 1900. This meaning refers to music from renaissance, baroque, classic and romantic periods. We are talking about tonal music composed in western tradition but in different periods and with different stylistic features. Finally, another very common meaning refers to the golden age span that goes from late baroque to early romantic. This is maybe the most common meaning, but not the most accurate. On the other hand, orchestral is just about the instruments that are used. You can write a rock \u2019n roll for full orchestra. This work would be orchestral, but not classical. And then one can wonder: What is Star Wars music? Well, it\u2019s tonal, it\u2019s orchestral, it\u2019s written in the western tradition. Historically it\u2019s out of the span of classical period. So it will be a post-romantic-contemporary orchestral work. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Opera (and oratorio and popular \u201cmusical comedy\u201d) is music which tells a story through drama and singing, usually at the same time. Opera differs only in that virtually all of the words are sung (as opposed to something like The Sound of Music, or Mary Poppins, in which there as good stretches of dialogue, as in a play, then somebody bursts into song). Classical Music is a term no one has totally defined. It\u2019s sometimes thought of as \u201cserious music\u201d - written for the sake of making music, as opposed to making music to sell or make yourself famous. But many of the great classical writers were famous, and all of them sold their music. Others may define it as \u201cmusic made by dead people\u201d, or maybe a little nicer, \u201cmusic that has stood the test of time.\u201d Orchestral Music means music that is performed by a large body of musicians called an Orchestra. Orchestra music comes in all types, all varieties, all genres that require a big body of players - but there is a \u201ctraditional\u201d orchestra that consists, usually , of the four main types of strings (violin, viola, cello, bass) and corresponding instrument groups of woodwinds and brass, plus percussion (drums), especially the tympani, or kettle-drums. It takes lots of time and money to get an orchestra together, even a volunteer one - so they tend to be made of the same instruments, or a very similar grouping (who would want to play a concert if your flute only got two lines of music, and there were two pages of music for some instrument that nobody in town played!)
