            "answer_text": "Nothing different then meeting anyone else. 1) Make eye contact2) Give a smile and a nod3) Mind my own businessIf BTS or any member wish to converse with me then they would come over to talk to me or they would send someone to see if I would like to talk with them. I would never approach them out of nowhere, unless I was at a meet and greet and it was my turn to approach one of them (and I am not that lucky to go to a meet and greet).I really don't like singer Shania Twain but I do like one of her songs because it describes me to a tee, \"Don't Impress Me Much\". Again, I do not need photos, autographs, fan services, or much of anything from famous people. That is why I told complete strangers to leave Bernadette Peters alone when she was trying to conduct a business dinner, and the patrons kept bothering her for autographs or when I was at the Chicago O'Hare in an Ice storm and James Kiberd and I grabbed the same employee to ask the exact same question, \"How much longer before we can board our planes\". Man did he look exhausted. My face showed I knew who they were, but I was not going to disturb them for it was not me. I respect the fact that it was after Thanksgiving and Mr. Kiberd was on his way back to New York probably to get back to the set. Or that Bernadette Peters was in town filming a scene in one of her movies, and probably was going over the script with the director or producer, again it was non of my business.I would like to meet BTS, talk with BTS, ask unfiltered questions to BTS, Like to view them as human beings not Idols. See what they do on down time, hobbies, ect. but again I won't ask for it, if it happens, than it will happen. They have the right to their privacy and I have no right to intrude on their privacy. ",

            "answer_text": "Although I hate to admit, I would probably cry. No seriously. I would break down and start crying real hard if I ever met BTS. Let\u2019s use a hypothetical situation, where I was lucky enough to make it to one of their fansigns. I would be that one fan who starts crying in front of them and they\u2019d all make fun of me. However, that\u2019s okay because I would finally get to meet the people I admire most in this world (sorry, mom and dad . . .) and get a chance to thank them for the positive change they brought to my life. Call me delusional and a crazy-a** fangirl, but I\u2019m going to be honest with you all here, and I hope you respect it. If it wasn\u2019t for BTS, I would still be a chaotic mess of a person I was 1.5 years ago. BTS truly saved me from destroying myself. 1.5 years ago was a dark and troublesome time. It was a time when I felt lost and worthless; when everything in my life seemed to be going south; when no one seemed to understand why I cried so much for \u201cno reason.\u201d However, BTS popped into my life and I finally felt as if someone understood my struggles. Their song lyrics not only reflected the pain of emptiness I felt inside, but also offered a sense of comfort in that they were also facing the same inner battle. BTS also didn\u2019t, and still doesn\u2019t, scorn you for feeling that way. You know how sometimes you\u2019re sad and you tell your parents, and they say things like: \u201cWhen I was your age, I had it much worse than you. You should be thankful and happy to be in the situation you\u2019re in. You millennials are so weak, spoiled, and over-privileged.\u201d \u2190 Yeah, BTS didn\u2019t do that. Instead, BTS acknowledges how you felt and told you it was okay to feel that way. They further go on to give you words of encouragement and the strength to move on through their song lyrics and speeches. After listening to and watching them after a while, something finally clicked inside for me. I became okay. Soon okay turned to better, and better turned to happy. Within the past 7 months that I have been stanning BTS, I have become almost a completely different, but better, person. Yeah, I might be a little crazy when it comes to supporting them, but it\u2019s not without rhyme or reason. So, if I ever got the chance to meet BTS, it would be like meeting the people who basically helped me turn my life around for the better, so of course I would cry. I would cry a river and I would thank each and every single one of them like crazy. Even if I don\u2019t look my best in front of them (because I\u2019m hideous when I burst into tears), that\u2019s okay. As long as I got a chance to show my gratitude to BTS for what they did for me, I would be content with ugly-crying and being made fun. Also, this answer is not a call for pity. I don\u2019t want you to feel sorry for me. I know many of us go through these struggles and I know I\u2019m not the only one. I simply just wanted to semi-pour my heart out today. If you\u2019re ever in need of a someone to listen to your sappy story or a shoulder to lean on during tough times, I\u2019m all ears ;) I know some of you might not take me too seriously because I write a lot of crack answers, but that\u2019s just because I want to make people happy and laugh. However, I still want to be of some help to Quora ARMY. I\u2019m not the smartest person, so please forgive me if I am unable to offer the best help and won\u2019t be able to give you the best advice. I know it\u2019s challenging to come out about these things. After telling my full story to a couple of people on Quora already, I know it just feels nice to have someone listen and someone understand. Hopefully, I can be of some help to some of you, like others and BTS were for me. Sorry if this was terribly written - I\u2019m not the best at expressing my feelings via words. Cheers :) I hope you\u2019re all having a good day. ",
