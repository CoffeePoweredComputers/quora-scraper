            "answer_text": "\u201cAfter Hours\u201d is the title of a 2020 song by seasoned Canadian singer and songwriter The Weeknd. The words of \u201cAfter Hours\u201d primarily center on a romantic relationship that failed to work out between the narrator and the addressee. From the lyrics, it is abundantly clear that the root cause of the relationship\u2019s inability to work out well was the narrator. He did certain things that broke her heart. But that being said, the lyrics don\u2019t make it crystal clear what said actions were. But all in all, he presently regrets said actions. He greatly misses the addressee and wants her back in his life again. So in one way or another, \u201cAfter Hours\u201d could be classified as an apology note the narrator is sending to his former lover. And from all indications, he clearly loves her, feels sorry for breaking her heart and wants to reconcile with her. Her absence in his life is indeed causing him unbearable misery. And the only antidote to this misery is via their reconciliation. ",
