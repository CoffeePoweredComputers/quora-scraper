In this day and age, we are gifted with the power of using the internet to make things like this a lot easier. Make posts on your blog, facebook, twitter, etc. saying what specific bands the music you like to sing sounds like, and what types of people you are looking for (drummer or bassist, experience or no experience, what agre, etc!). Also, make an effort to learn more about the local music scene in your area. Are there many local bands from around you? If so, try to go to as many of their concerts as you can in order to support them. Over time, you may become a known fan to them, and even get to know some members of the bands, who will more likely than not have connections to people who are looking for the exact same thing as you are.
