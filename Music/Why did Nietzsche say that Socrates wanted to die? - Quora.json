            "answer_text": "Socrates gave, in The Apology, what was at best a misdirected defense of himself; he did not direct his argument towards his audience, in fact, it seems very much intended to offend the audience rather than to convince them. He told the jury in his legal defense that he was the smartest person in the world and that he understood poetry better than the poets, and so on and so forth. Socrates comes off as a self assured know-it-all, and this before he totally blows the chance to propose his own punishment. He proposed, not that he get a fine which one of his followers had already offered to pay, but, that his punishment should be equal to the reward given to Olympic victors, free meals for life. He was given the opportunity to escape from the death sentence, which more jurors had voted in favor of than in the first vote of whether or not he was guilty. He was unable to convince his jurors of his innocence, and unwilling to submit to any other punishment but death. It is indisputable that Socrates chose to die, Nietzsche argues that he in fact wanted to die and that this was a consequence of his philosophical beliefs. Nietzsche argues that inside Platonic Philosophy is the seed of nihilism. This seed is the belief in a realm of pure Forms which is more real than the appearing world, which only takes partial participation in the pure Being of the Forms, and which that philosopher escapes in order to approach truth. Nietzsche describes in Twilight of the Idols how this idea of the Ideal developed through centuries of Western culture, religion and Philosophy to become an unwillingness to value Life and the world as it appears. Instead, the life of the ordinary mortal is like a life lived in a cave, with nothing to do but to watch a spectacle unfold before your eyes, never to see that the spectacle is a sham, shadows created by firelight, never to climb out of the cave to see the reflections of things, then things and finally the sun - No, this is the life of the philosopher who leaves behind the mere mortals for communion with Being. Never forget that Socrates conceived of philosophy as a practice for death, and the withdrawal of the mind from the present moment was not only a small death, but it touched on something more real than the present moment of exigent life. And with this, we get to the value scale that Nietzsche hated in Socrates, and Western Philosophy to follow, the separation of the concepts body and soul, the idea that only the soul can approach Truth and only by withdrawing from participation in life, and the valuation of the things encountered by the mind in its withdrawal as more real than the things seen in any present moment. And, having travelled to the spiritual location of the Ideals the philosopher would know his way back and thus achieve a kind of immortality denied to heroes whose glorious tales would last after their death and to the political actors of Athens who were guaranteed a kind of immortality through the continuation of the polis and its laws and peoples. Socrates might as well have said to Athens \u201cStrike me down and I will only grow stronger.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Because Socrates last word was \u201cCrito, we owe a rooster to Aclepius\u201d. Asclepius was the god of medicine in the greek pantheon. So Nietzsche, and others, intended that the illness from which Asclepius healed Socrates was life itself.Foucault give a different explanation. Crito was the one disciple that prayed Socrates to let his friend make him escape from death row, but Socrates decided to face death than run away and betray himself. So the illness was the fear of death, not life. Still the last words of Socrates are enigmatic. ",
