Oh, wait, wrong movie, I did all of Woodstock, that\u2019s right ;-)Sadly, I actually used to know this, then I got old. Puerto Rican Rum most likely killed the brain cells that held that information. Seriously, though, that\u2019s not on Wiki or IDMB? I would think it\u2019d be on one of those. I take a look and see if I can find a reminder. Does Google not work any longer? I seriously wouldn\u2019t be surprised to tell the truth.So, it looks like Fox played it, in synch after learning it from Paul Hanson. At least that was the first answer I could find that was confirmed by a second source. So, Mike Fox played it and then acted it out it like he\u2019d learned. Not bad, I\u2019m fairly impressed. ",

As for his mannerisms while playing it, he took clues from the on stage mannerisms of Chuck Berry (duh!), Jimi Hendrix, and Pete Townshend. By the way that guitar was a Gibson ES-345 with the Varitone system and it's bridge replaced with a Bigsby vibrato. ",
