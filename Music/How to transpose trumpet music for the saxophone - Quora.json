            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re transposing for the tenor or soprano saxophone you don\u2019t need to do anything as they are also Bb instruments. The soprano will sound the same note as you\u2019re playing on trumpet and the tenor will sound an octave down from the note you\u2019ll hear on trumpet. For alto you\u2019ll need to go up a fifth (to sound the same as trumpet) or down a fourth to sound an octave lower. Baritone playing the same written note as alto will sound an octave lower. For all of the saxophones if your transposed music goes lower than the Bb beneath middle C then you\u2019ll have to change it, as the saxophone range only goes down to Bb (apart from some baritones which go down to \u2018A\u2019). Similarly the upper range is typically up to the F# written above the stave (the space above the third leger line). Personally I like playing on tenor with trumpet players as we can read the same music and will sound an octave apart if we follow the music exactly. You\u2019ll hear this on a lot of jazz records where they have that line up. Sometimes for effect the two instruments will play the same sounded note by one of them shifting up/down an octave, which is a nice colour. ",

            "answer_text": "When I first started to learn how to transpose to other instruments I would listen to say the trombones and then try to match the same pitches during band warmups. Later, I would do the same with the saxophone. Next I would ask the players about their instrument \u201cand if I played this note, what note is it for you\u201d type of questioning. I then had to refer to concert pitch, meaning I had to learn the distance from concert pitch to Eb saxophone. Later I realized that if it was a C on trumpet then it\u2019s an A on sax. Later instead of going up a 6th it was easier to go down a minor 3rd. This is what I do to this day. As I advanced during my years at the University, my professor had me buy a book where we had to play orchestral excerpts written for different instruments pitched in different keys and I had to transpose at sight. It took awhile but with consistency, I got better at it. This process helped me when I started to arrange horn charts for a Top 40\u2019s band. If you have a recording of the music it will also help you when you try to play it on sax to check that you have the right transposition. Good luck and have fun. ",
