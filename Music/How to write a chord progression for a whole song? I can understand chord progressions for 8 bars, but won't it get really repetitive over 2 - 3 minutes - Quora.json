            "answer_text": "You could just not think in chords at all\u2026 \u2026besides that, yes, that can get repetitive\u2014which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, btw.\u2014and by itself might sound quite boring, but, to only have a single chord progression played that never changes as the whole of the music is\u2026 unusual. Thing is, not only can you change up the chord progression or transpose it into another key at different points, there are also other instruments that play different things over those chords. Also, you could have different rhythmic accents\u2014or just plain a completely different rhythm and/or meter(s) at times\u2014 the chords themselves could be changed up a bit here and there, like playing some inversion of a chord, substitute it, or just make it denser by adding other notes to the chord\u2026 even a simple 7-chord can sound quite intense if the rest is all just triads. If there are lyrics then those will add variation as well\u2026 I mean, you rarely\u2014but not never\u2014hear a song made up of literally just a single phrase repeated over and over. By the time you have the actual finished instrumentation and arrangement\u2014aka the actually finished song, because just having chords and maybe the lyrics is not a finished song, at all\u2014the repetitive nature of the chord progression will actually have and effect closer to \u201canchoring\u201d the song in a way that makes it easier to follow while the rest makes it so it isn\u2019t boring.  And then again, repetition in music is not a necessarily bad thing, quite the contrary\u2026 a musical piece completely devoid of repetition would be aimless and chaotic. Interesting as a concept, maybe, but in practice probably borderline unlistenable\u2026 yet even the polar opposite, something so repetitious as to be devoid of changes, can be quite nice to listen to\u2014for example, one of my favorite tracks by Daft Punk, Make Love, is repetitious to an almost absurd degree, yet taking that repetition away would diminish the track, not enhance it.

            "answer_text": "Very few songs repeat 8 bars of the same chords over and over. Well, I take that back. I\u2019m not familiar with current pop music. But from Tin Pan Alley through the rock era, most popular songs had at least a bridge, often a chorus, and sometimes both (plus maybe a pre-chorus and intro) in addition to the verse. All of these bits provide contrast to the verse, and almost always contain (somewhat) different chords than the verse. If you wanted my advice, I\u2019d say listen to a lot of songs by songwriters generally regarded as \u201cgreat\u201d and try to figure out what they\u2019re doing harmonically, and how the chords, melody, and lyrics work together. OR, decide to be repetitive and revel in it. There are some fabulous songs that use the same short sequence of chords over and over. It\u2019s possible to go that route, but you have to keep the listener\u2019s interest somehow. One of the greatest albums of all time is Van Morrison\u2019s Astral Weeks. About half the songs on the album have just a couple chords repeated over and over. It works because of the sheer intensity of Morrison\u2019s performance. Maybe give a listen to Tom Petty\u2019s song Free Fallin\u2019. It\u2019s the same two bars over and over, but there is a distinguishable verse, chorus, and instrumental break. I think this song only works because the hooks are so good and the lyrics so spare and evocative. Hmmm, what else? The Rolling Stones\u2019 Last Time is pretty repetitive, but still a great song. Day Tripper has the same riff most of the way through (the chords change and the riff changes with them). I\u2019ll Take You There (by the Staple Singers) is the same riff all the way through. I\u2019m on a roll now. Here are some more: Born on the Bayou Cloudy Shoes Jump Into the Fire Papa Was a Rolling Stone The Passenger ",
