            "answer_text": "If you never used any audio recording software before: use whatever came with your audio interface and microphone when you purchased those. It is free and will be a good starting point. If you are experienced in recording: use whatever you have been using so far. Learn how to take the most out of it. My point: use whatever you have available and learn everything there is to learn about that one. At some point you might want to try a different one, don\u2019t. Only switch if you have a good reason such as a feature that doesn\u2019t exist on your current one with no workarounds or price range and budget. ",
