            "answer_text": "There are no artists like Kanye but many of the recent artists have taken a page out of the infamous Kanye west book. When Kanye first came out you had to be a gangster to be a rapper unless you were white -i.e. Eminem and beastie boys- Kanye was a college kid wearing a pink polo and a backpack now fast forward and we have the likes of Drake who recently says he was influenced by Kanye, kid Cudi, Travis Scott, and artists/ producers (which Kanye is God of) such as Russ and Tyler the Creator. But to narrow it all down I personally think kid Cudi is most similar to Kanye west in a musically creative aspect. ",

            "answer_text": "Not many if any are really similar to Kanye west. In my mind he\u2019s in his own sub genre of hip hop. If I hear a song that sounds like a Kanye beat it\u2019s because that\u2019s the only artist you can compare it to and is a huge compliment to whatever song that is. You know when your listening to Kanye and when your not there\u2019s really no grey areas. Nas would be closest if I had to pick someone though. Edit: Just realized Kanye produced Nas\u2019 new album so I guess that would make it sound like Kanye. He\u2019s one of a kind producer nobody can make the beats that he comes up with in my opinion.
