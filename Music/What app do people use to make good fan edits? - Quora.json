            "answer_text": "Any video editing software will do, but it is recommended to use desktop/laptop rather than mobile devices. Type of software being used and tips are often discussed in fan edit forum and other places, so I would definitely suggest visiting there, so you can actually see links to number of fan edits you might be able to see example of. If you already have Adobe CC suits that works well, and if you want to use DaVinci Resolves and others, they are also capable. But it really come down to your personal preference and also group decision if you teamed up with someone to take on some large fan edits project. ",

You can edit on phones with the likes of Power Director on Android or you can have LumaFusion, the best on iOS. There are loads of apps for Linux, Mac and PC. In the end, the choice of edit software is very personal. Try some out and see what you get on with best. ",
