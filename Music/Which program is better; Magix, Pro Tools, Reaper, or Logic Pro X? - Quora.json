            "answer_text": "Each one have their own set of strengths. Which program is better depends on your needs and requirements, such as cost and usage. Some software have lesser features, but is cheaper (Eg: Logic Pro compared to Pro Tools), while others are more widely accepted (Eg Ableton Vs Logic (Logic is a stand alone for Mac only) I personally use three different DAWs - Logic Pro X, Pro Tools 12HD Ableton Live 9. I use Pro Tools to edit and record vocals (also because it\u2019s the industry standard and the one the used at my studio), Logic to produce music, and Ableton to edit tracks to create mashups and edit. I use each of the software for a specific purpose because I liked how easy it was to do each of the tasks above. Even though it\u2019s not in the list, I would like to recommend Ableton Live. It allows you to use it live and produce at the same time and is compatible across Mac and Windows. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say go with Logic for composition, and everything concerning the creative aspect of music. For everything sound - Mix, Master, Audio - Pro tools. If you can\u2019t afford to have that segmentation at this point, stick to Logic, and you\u2019ve got good enough stuff out of the box to cut a fantastic record. In the initial years of being in music, its more about being open to learning, than being on the right tool. ",
