            "answer_text": "One can argue that almost any tune will be a combination of parts that have already been composed unless the tune is so contemporary and weird that it doesn\u2019t really resemble \u201cmusic\u201d in the traditional western context. In the old days before intellectual property laws were set classical composers actually intentionally copied each other, it was thought to be a tribute to the original composer as you found his material to be so good that you wanted to reuse the structures. In my opinion the modern era lawsuit ridden \u201che copied my tune\u201d phenomenon is a bit absurd and silly to be honest. Usually the original tune is already a copy of some more unkown and older tune, which is also probably based on something older and original etc. It\u2019s all part of the music culture and tradition and one can rarely say that these notes in this order is truly my creation and idea. But to answer your question, I don\u2019t believe there are any solid ways to make sure what you are composing is truly original. You will just have to rely on instinct and some general knowledge of what works there already are. Usually the problems only relate to so popular works that there is some instance that actually is interested in creating lawsuits. Hence the realm of problematic works is quite limited. Also the length of the musical structure has to be somewhat long until it becomes a problem. Just a few notes and chords is not enough. It has to be so definitive structure that it really means that you are really copying the tune, not just a conceptual atomic part. So probability of accidentally creating long line of notes and harmonies that is part of well known tune is not that high without you actually realizing that it is a tune you have heard before. ",

            "answer_text": "Melodies have been being re-used since time immemorial. So copyright on a tune is in that way similar to \u201clook and feel\u201d patents on software. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve run across composers and songwriters very aptly copying the \u201clook and feel\u201d of a pre-existing piece of music while avoiding copying that exact tune. Satirist Roy Zimmerman of The Foremen is a master at this, having not only an amazing control of genre but an amazing ability to \u201ccopy\u201d the words and lyrics of a given song to a different tune, including \u201cSan Diego\u201d (San Francisco), \u201cChicago\u201d (Mrs. Robinson), \u201cI Want a Marriage Like They Had in the Bible\u201d (any number of revival humns, but particularly \u201cGive Me That Old Time Religion,\u201d \u201cLimbaugh\u201d (Limbo Rock), and \u201cEvery Man For Himself\u201d (a really nice touch of irony here, Bridge Over Troubled Water). I also remember once seeing an early animation, from the 20s or 30s, on a compilation of cartoons by Ub Iwerks, that featured a cartoon bumblebee doing a rather slinky dance to a tune that was clearly referring to the Haba\u00f1era from Bizet\u2019s Carmen, even though it was a different tune. In fact, I guess setting out to do that would be a good way of avoiding doing it accidentally, but it doesn\u2019t really produce something new. ",
