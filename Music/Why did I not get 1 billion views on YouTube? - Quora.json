            "answer_text": "Why did I not get 1 billion views on YouTube? The most logical answer is because your video did not reach 10 billion or 100 billion people. When your video has the potential to be shared outside your immediate circles, the video would go viral. But with so much of competition and also content creators who have established themselves in every niche over the last decade, it's tough for new channels to breakthrough. The novelty is lost, people don\u2019t bother to subscribe to new channels and even worse YouTube doesn\u2019t show your videos to your audience because its a loss of revenue for the platform.  ",
