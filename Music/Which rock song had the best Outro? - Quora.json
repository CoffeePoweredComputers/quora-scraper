            "answer_text": "As I was scrolling through Quora, I was playing a playlist of mine I made of songs I wasn\u2019t too familiar with but knew off of Discover Weekly\u2019s and thing like that were good. So as I read through answers from Sean Kernan, Nathan Stanish, etc, I was listing to a song I had never heard the whole way through, though I knew of the song. That song is November Rain.  Originally, I thought the song was very long, though it did make good use of it\u2019s runtime of around 9 minutes long. As it went along, I realized the song was pretty good. I would even consider it a ballad, you know? Good long songs like that deserve more recognition. And then, with 2 minutes to go, you hear something special. Something I\u2019ve never experienced before. It caught me off guard. So off guard, in fact, I had to go on Spotify and check to make sure that was the same song I had just been listening to. It was. For those of you not familiar with the song, just as I was not even 10 minutes ago, it is a love song that discusses how nothing lasts forever and other unfortunate things like that, in a sort of way you feel as thought someone is lecturing you. And the first 7 minutes truly are great and deserve high praise on its own, it really does. And then, much like the movie Se7en, the song goes from good to absolutely legendary. The chords change. Everything changes. You feel.. different. It\u2019s just an epic experience I have never truly been through before. The ending to Layla by Eric Clapton was amazing, but the beginning was better in my opinion. You can\u2019t beat a classic guitar solo. But this is different. It doesn\u2019t even truly build up. It\u2019s just good all around and then the ending hits you and you\u2019re left wondering what just happened. That is why I firmly believe that November Rain has the best outro of all time, with Happy Together by The Turtles at #2. ",

            "answer_text": "These songs are my favorite outros, A Million Miles Away - Rory Gallagher Rory\u2019s powerful vocals with little bit of screaming, his saxophone playing and most notably Lou Martin\u2019s keyboard solo. Very exciting ending. Kinda sad if you feel the lyrics. I think this song is a biography of Rory Gallagher. High Hopes - Pink Floyd An emotional outro with backing orchestration (type of) and a crying slide guitar solo. With lots of pitch effects. Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin Wouldn\u2019t ignore it. The song has great intro, outro, middle eight, everything. Great everything. Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again - The Who Depends on what you consider to be outro. After a repeating keyboard part, the ending drumming, the screaming. Great. Layla - Derek And The Dominos The album version. With piano riffs, the slide guitar solo and so on. Hey Jude - The Beatles Great. May be little bit of repetitive but the rhythm, especially Ringo\u2019s drumming and Paul\u2019s screaming. November Rain - Guns N\u2019 Roses Slash master string bendings with a perfect outro. Showed how much can full bends make effect on the solos. Floods - Pantera Many people like this song because of this outro. The solo is really awful but the ending licks were great. ",
