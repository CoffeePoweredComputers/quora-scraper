            "answer_text": "How popular is K-pop in India In 2012, in a small auditorium in New Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University, 37 contestants participated in the first official K-pop contest in India attended by 300 people. Six years later, the total number of participants swelled to 898 and the venue of the \u2018K-pop Contest India 2017\u2019 on July 29 was the swanky Talkatora Indoor Stadium that saw a turnout of over 2,000 K-pop fans. Organized by the Korean Cultural Centre, a wing of the South Korean embassy, the event has become the mecca for K-pop fans in India. Such is the popularity of the contest that regional rounds had to be held in 11 cities, including Chennai, Patna, Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad, Bengaluru to select participants for the main contest. \u201cWe have traditional and contemporary culture but mostly youngsters from all over the world enjoy contemporary music. When we started this contest, it was a very cozy event. Since then every year, the number of participants and audience are growing,\u201d says Kim Kum-Pyoung, director of the Korean Cultural centre. EXO-L in India One of K-pop industry\u2019s reigning boy bands, EXO has a massive fan base across India. EXO-L (the official name of EXO fans) India interact over 20 WhatsApp groups divided on a regional basis (because only 256 people can be added in one group). The communication level is ceaseless, so much so that an EXO-L from Mizoram is well acquainted with the one from Delhi. In May 2017, to commemorate the group\u2019s fifth anniversary, EXO-Ls raised Rs 58,000 and donated to Ummang Foundation, an NGO that works with underprivileged children in Mumbai. \u201cIn an age of digital streaming, K-pop is the rare music industry where the sale of physical album copies is still prevalent. The sales contribute to the profit of artists directly. From India, we ordered 350 physical copies of EXO\u2019s recent albums \u2018The War\u2019. We also collaborated with EXO-Global and contributed Rs 12,000 for a food truck during their Encore concert in Seoul,\u201d says Ritika Mitra, an admin of EXO-L India. In Manipur, 139 EXO-Ls booked a cinema hall to together watch a recent EXO concert last month. BTS\u2019s ARMY in India is no joke K-pop band BTS or Bangtan Boys catapulted into the global music scene after winning a Billboard Music Award, where they beat pop music giants like Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez in the social media category. However, their ARMY (BTS\u2019s official fandom name) had a presence in India much before they captured international fame. The Bangtan ARMY India was formed in 2014, a year after the group debuted. \u201cOn July 28, the group created a Google database to assess the number of ARMY in India. We got the response from 2,300 people in four days,\u201d says Twinkle, an admin of Bangtan Indian ARMY Facebook page, which has over 6,700 likes. \u201cAfter BTS\u2019s mentioned India in the interview in Rolling Stone\u2019s magazine, Indian ARMY started trending #IndialovesBTS on Twitter and it reached No. 2 on worldwide trends,\u201d says admin Oitrika Biswas.

IKFM is now recognised by the South Korean government. \u201cI have a full-time job. I organise IKFM activities for my sheer love for K-pop. We are trying to make K-pop mainstream so that the stigma attached to liking it is eliminated. People bully K-pop fans, we want people to see things through our eyes,\u201d she said. Youth in Nagaland are second-generation K-pop aficionados. \u201cMy mum is into K-pop. She loves Shinhwa, Super Junior and EXO. I knew about K-pop as a kid through her,\u201d says Ezon Houtsog, 19, who flew to Myanmar to attend his first EXO concert this year. \u201cIt was a dream to see them live. You always stream them on YouTube, so when I was there, I kept thinking \u2018Am I really here\u2019?\u201d he says. A fashion designer from Delhi, Kanika Agarwal explains, \u201cTheir music is so catchy and groovy. You can feel it.\u201d She jetted to Singapore to watch an EXO concert last April. \u201cPeople were crying and fainting everywhere. The girl next to me passed out even without the band on stage,\u201d she says. Unlike other singers, K-pop artists are scouted at an early age by entertainment agencies and are made to undergo training for several years before making their debuts. They act in Korean dramas and films, and often appear in talk-shows. \u201cYou watch the K-pop idols on variety shows, and knowing about their life stories. They are so hard working, it gives me patience, I get inspiration from them,\u201d says Elizabeth Longjam from Manipur, whose 80-year-old grandma is a big fan of the drama \u2018Boys Over Flowers\u2019. K-pop is a self-contained universe in itself where artists are at the centre and lives of fans revolve around them. It is a phenomenon, a form of subculture with its own eccentricities. So to conclude, the three sentences at the beginning of this article simply mean: The youngest member of the group is 13 years old. Send me the streaming link, hurry. Sister, we need to win the music award this year ",

            "answer_text": "They might be coming to India as a part of their Asia Tour for the Love Yourself Tour\u2026it also seems that Bighit hinted KMedia that they might be heading to Mumbai in 2019. All we can do is cross our fingers and hope they do come\u2026If we\u2019re going to look at why they didn't come previously is because Kpop doesn't have a massive fanbase neither has it any exposure to our country mate, while other countries such as the US,UK have jumped upon the BTS hype train India clearly hasn't caught upon but on the brighter side our fanbase over here is increasing.
