            "answer_text": "The main purpose of Coachella is to provide a platform to all sorts of creators and performers that can showcase their work to an eclectic mix of audience \u2013 those willing to spend their hard earned money to curb their hunger for art. Coachella is a haven for all to gather and share their love for music, make new friends, rekindle old ones in a span of 3 straight days. It forces you to get out of your routine, make your way to the desert and enjoy live performances from noon till dusk the next day. It gives you the space to be with nature, basking in the perfect April sunlight in the day and getting slightly punished by the sandy winds matched by the radical drop in temperature at night, in typical desert fashion. It reminds you of the beauty that humans can be from all walks of life, and the beauty that humans can create, with sound, with words, with endless resources that we can find. Coachella reminds us of our better selves, if we just listen and let the music lead the way. ",
