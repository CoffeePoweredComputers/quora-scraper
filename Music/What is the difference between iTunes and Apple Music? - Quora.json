            "answer_text": "On the first glance, it is quite confusing to non-savvy users. However, when you get the hang of it, you will understand that iTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by Apple.[1]Essentially, it is a proprietary software used to manage Apple devices exclusively. You cannot transfer music to your (non-jailbreak) Apple device without iTunes.In that iTunes software (on PC), you can find the iTunes Store. It is a software-based online digital media store operated by Apple Inc.[2]If you do not have any existing music, movies, e-books, etc., in your iTunes Library, you may like to shop them in the iTunes Store. Click here for more information.Apple Music is a separate service offered by Apple. It is a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc. Users select music to stream to their device on-demand, or they can listen to existing, curated playlists.[3]aOn iPhone/iPad, the independence of Apple Music and iTunes Store is more apparent. You can use Apple Music to stream unlimited music (the entire music catalog in iTunes) with a monthly fee without touching the iTunes Store at all. The introduction of Apple Music is in response to Spotify, as consumers prefer to pay a monthly price (as of now, generally it is just $9.99/mo) for unlimited access than one-time payment for ownership of individual tracks (generally $0.99\u2013$1.29 per).So where is the confusion? This is where it gets little bit confusing for non-savvy users\u2026 as you need to use iTunes to manage your Apple Music activities on PC, and your saved Apple Music musics are all placed under your iTunes Library. By default, the store visibly shown in iTunes is the iTunes Store, so if you are using Apple Music, you need to specifically find the Apple Music section. Files purchased from the iTunes Store are categorised as Purchases while files from Apple Music are categorised as Apple Music/DRM in the iTunes Library.

            "answer_text": "iTunes is a music store where you can purchase songs and download them. Apple Music is a subscription-based streaming service. With iTunes, you pay to own a license of a song. With Apple Music, you pay for access to a catalog of songs through a monthly subscription fee. If this sounds confusing, let's use movies as an example. When you buy a movie from iTunes, you pay a one-time fee and are granted a license to download the film. This resembles the traditional business of buying a movie. Now, if you pay for a Netflix subscription, you pay for access to watch movies but you are not paying to own any single film. If one day Netflix decides to remove a film from their catalog, you do not have any way of reclaiming it because you do not own the license. This is pretty much the same for music. ",
