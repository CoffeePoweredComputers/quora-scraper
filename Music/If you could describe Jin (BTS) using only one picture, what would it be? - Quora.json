            "answer_text": " Early Jin takes care of his members in his own quiet ways without drawing attention to himself. He cooks for the BTS team & made sure they are well fed. He brought Jungkook to his home for Christmas in the early days. He didn\u2019t want him spending Christmas alone without his family. He drove him to school like a supportive big brother to make sure he gets to class on time.  This picture best describe Jin\u2019s most attractive quality-his maturity which is seriously underrated. He is the one that keep the Maknae Line in check even if you see him clowning around with them more than disciplining. Different strokes (parenting style) for different folks!\ud83d\ude09 He may not be the greatest dancer but he make up for it by being an awesome BTS game show host with his witty comments and quick reflexes. And he gave a killer solo performance each time he is on stage singing \u201cEpiphany\u201d! He is everything we would love to have as a supporting Big Brother! But with more affection as come on, look at him, he is GORGEOUS!\ud83d\udc9c Source/Credits: The above picture/GIF are not mine. Thank you Google Images & Twitter. ",

            "answer_text": " Here\u2019s Man In Black Seokjin. No picture can define his beauty but he defines handsome so well.  This one is from KBS song festival 2018 enjoy himself with the support of members and making audience+artists go cheer for him. Carefree Kim SeokJin  I don\u2019t clearly remember from where this picture is maybe concert. This is funny Kim Seok Jin. The one members and ARMY are mostly familiar with. But he is more than these. He is very private, responsible and serious person in his personal life. Yes, his character is not all true himself. Jin of BTS is very confident but Kim Seok Jin isn\u2019t, not for his voice, dance and also not for his looks. He had songs in which he described his lack of confidence. He may be savage one with ARMY and cracking jokes with them but on the other side he is caring and considerate idol for his fans. He makes sure ARMY is included in their winning speech and interviews. He even sang a whole song dedicated to ARMY i.e. MOON from the album MAP OF THE SOUL: 7. For his members, he is hyung who is fake maknae\ud83d\ude02 but on the other side, he takes care of them since the beginning as he is the eldest and one to whom even RM can lean on.  At last,a piece of advice from WORLDWIDE HANDSOME himself. ",
