            "answer_text": "By saying things they find worth listening to. By being someone worthy of respect. It\u2019s the same with any human. What\u2019s confusing you is you\u2019re cloaking your meaning in words that sound more acceptable. What you mean is, How can I get kids to obey and fear me enough not to question what I\u2019ve ordered them to do. You do that the way all authoritarians do. It\u2019s done through intimidation. An authoritarian makes sure they\u2019re known to be more powerful and will to use their power to make life unpleasant for those who won\u2019t obey. Authoritarian parenting seems to work when children are young. Children know their survival depends on their parents so they can only push back so far. Some kids push back enough to show they object, making the atmosphere in the house very unpleasant, but ultimately give in. Some kids hide their resentment, letting it build up, but go along. Some kids pretend to go along but learn to be more sneaky. Some kids accept their weakness and unworthiness and meekly obey. Where the \u201cworking\u201d shows it\u2019s flaws is when kids become teens. Teens are naturally wired to reject being told what to do. They need to try out their own ideas to test their understanding. If they\u2019ve been confined to doing what they\u2019re told often the only way they can feel like an idea is their own is to do the opposite of what they\u2019re told, even when they know it\u2019s foolish. But worse, all those repressed feelings of resentment of being pushed around from childhood come bursting forth. All the ways they\u2019ve been shown how to deal with disagreement come back at the parent tenfold. Except for the meek ones. They often carry their feelings into adulthood finding it difficult to stand up for themselves. If you really want your children to listen, then you need to show them how it\u2019s done by you listening to them. Hear them out. Make them feel heard by understanding what problem they\u2019re struggling with. Then be their partner in finding a solution that\u2019s safe, respectful of others, and practical. If you want to be respected, let them feel you respect them. When solving an issue together, build respect for others into the solution. Children need to feel respected first. They need to see they don\u2019t need to choose between their needs and someone else\u2019s. They are ways to respect both. Too many parents withhold respect until children give it. But children learn how to treat others from how they\u2019re treated. Whatever you do to your child, however you treat them, that\u2019s how they\u2019re learning to treat others. If you resolve conflicts by yelling and threatening punishment, how will they ever know how to do it any other way? Children are new human beings who are still trying to figure out not only how to meet their needs but the whole lot more complex issue of thinking about how their solution impacts everyone else. Be patient, calm, helpful especially when they\u2019re struggling. It\u2019s easy to be peaceful when everything is going smoothly. The true test of ethics is being able to act on one\u2019s values even when the world is in chaos. Be a listener and your children will learn the value of listening to understand another. Be respectful and help your children think of others as you help them get their needs met and they will understand the value of treating others with respect. I\u2019d suggest How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk by Adele Faber, Elaine Mazlish. It\u2019s an easy read full of real-life situations and practical tips.

Tell them - once and once only - what the consequences will be if they don\u2019t obey the first time (no second chances), and then - this is the crucial part - always, always keep your word. Why should they listen if you have taught them that nothing happens if they don\u2019t? ",

That is hardly true but is true. You need to be a good role model if you want to be respected, but to be not to act that role model. ",
