            "answer_text": "A2a Both were talented in their own way. Despite the obvious similarity in their apparent method of departing this life they differed quite a bit musically. Kurt was actually quite pop driven where he would turn great hooks into yelly sounding yet catchy punk type songs. Chester is more ballad like even when the songs are harder sounding. There is less emphasis on a hook and more of a crooning type balladeer m.o. to me. ",
