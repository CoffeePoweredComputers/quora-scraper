            "answer_text": "I think that Duane Allman was a top-tier rock guitarist. His career was short, but so was that of Jimi Hendrix. He had an outstanding band around him and was fortunate enough to play with two superb co-lead guitarists in Dickie Betts and Eric Clapton. Still, I think Duane was one of the greats for a few reasons: He pioneered a sound that has really not been matched - slide guitar at the top frets, hitting the very highest notes on the guitar. Southern rock and blues had been rich with slide, but Allman\u2019s sound was different - distinct from blues and from country.He had a wonderful sense of melody. Although much of Allman\u2019s music was improvised, he also played written instrumental parts gracefully. Unlike many of his peers, Duane Allman really loved the sound of major scales, which made the Allman Brothers music distinct.There was a hopeful nature to Duane's playing. After rockabilly took a backseat to the \u201cserious\u201d rock of the late 60s, the guitar became a more severe instrument. Players like Jorma Kaukonen, Mick Ronson, and Peter Green brought great attention to the rock guitar, but a little of the fun was lost. Duane Allman\u2019s style was consistently uplifting, even when playing music with a sad theme (Betts, on the other hand, had a much sadder sound).",

            "answer_text": "He was extraordinary. Absolutely one of the top rock guitarist ever, in the same league with Hendrix or Beck. Clapton was in awe of him. He had a great feel for the blues, but often had a jazzy feel to his playing. He didn\u2019t overplay, but when it was called for, he could just \u201cgo off\u201d and make almost any other guitarist shake their head in amazement. Duane had an incredible ability to produce a wide array of tones through his hands and how he played, ranging from where he picked the strings, how hard or soft, using his hands to mute strings, and the subtle use of the two volume controls to produce such a wide range of tones. What others needed to use effects for, he could do organically with his hands. Listen to his solo on In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed from the Live At Fillmore East album. It\u2019s a staggering display of brilliant improvisation from a master at the top of his game. ",
