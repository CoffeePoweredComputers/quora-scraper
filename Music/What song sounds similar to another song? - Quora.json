            "answer_text": "Careless Whispers by George Michael released in 1984 sounds extremely similar to Cause We\u2019ve Ended as Lovers by Syreeta Wright which was released in 1974 (Also covered by Jeff Beck in 1975).    The opening riff and main riff of the song Reach for the Sky by Firehouse released in 1992 sounds exactly same as Into the Fire by Dokken which was released in 1984.   Youth Gone Wild by Skid Row released in 1989 sounds similar to Too Young to Fall in Love by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce which was released in 1983   The tune of the song Viva La Vida by Coldplay released in 2008 is basically lifted from I could fly by Joe Satriani which was released in 2004. All they did is to use a synth to play it and sped it up because lifting a tune by Satriani won\u2019t give you the guitar skills of Satriani.   The tune of Midnight Memories by One Direction released in 2013 is lifted from Pour Some Sugar on Me by Deff Leppard which was released in 1978.   The tune of Me Love by Sean Kingston released in 2008 was lifted from D\u2019yer Mak\u2019er by Led Zeppelin which was released in 1973.   The tune of the song I\u2019ll be missing you released by Puff Daddy in 1997 is straight on lifted from Every Breath You Take by The Police which was released in 1983   The tune of Best Song Ever by One Direction released in 2013 is lifted from Baba O\u2019 Riley by The Who which was released in 1971.   The tune of Ice Ice Baby by Vanilla Ice released in 1989 was straight on lifted from the song Under Pressure by Queen, which was released in 1982.   The tune of Phantom of the Opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber released in 1986 was the combination of tunes lifted from the songs Echoes by Pink Floyd released in 1971 and Till You by Ray Repp released in 1965.    The tunes of Love Train by Big & Rich, and Walkie Talkie Man by Steriogram released in 2004 were lifted from the song Warning by Green Day released in 2000, who themselves lifted this tune from the song Picture Book by The Kinks, which was released in 1968.     The tune of C\u2019est la Vie! by Shania Twain released in 2002 sounds similar to Dancing Queen by Abba which was released in 1976.   The tune of Mary Jane\u2019s Last Dance by Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers released in 2009 is quite similar to the tune of Dani California by Red Chilli Peppers released in 2006.   The tune of Live While We\u2019re Young by One Direction released in 2012 is straight on copied from Should I Stay or Should I Go by The Clash which was released in 1982.   The tune of both Rockstar by Miley Cyrus released in 2007, and Scotty Doesn\u2019t Know by Lustra released in 2006 sound similar to the song Reptile by The Church which was released in 1988.    This one is damn funny, the tune of Are You Gonna Be My Girl by Jet released in 2003 was lifted from Lust from Life by Iggy Pop which was released in 1977, they themselves lifted this tune from the song called I\u2019m Ready For Love by Martha And The Vandellas released in October 6, 1966, and even that song lifted this tune from the song called You Can\u2019t Hurry Love by The Supremes which was released in July 25, 1966. Now this is what I call liftception.     ",
