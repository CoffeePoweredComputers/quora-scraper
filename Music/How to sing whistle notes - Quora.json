            "answer_text": "Singing whistle tone is not for everyone. Only a select few are able to master it. A couple of examples are Mariah Carey and Ariana Grande. I can do it, but it isn\u2019t strong at all. Start by singing a basic 1\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20135\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 warm-up from low going to high. Once you reach your head voice, continue going until it feels a tad strained. Then, switch to humming or buzzing on the same pattern (the correct way to hum is with your lips together and your teeth apart). You will eventually feel a switch (hopefully). This is your whistle tone. For me, it feels quite strained humming, but easier when actually singing. Humming/buzzing will give you the feel of it. If for whatever reason you don\u2019t feel the switch, I don\u2019t know what to say as I am not a qualified vocal coach (please take everything I say with a grain of salt). Try looking for a vocal coach that specialized in whistle tone (if they exist) or a soprano vocal coach (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re female). I hope this helps! ",
