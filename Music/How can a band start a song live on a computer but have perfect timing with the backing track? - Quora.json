            "answer_text": "Can you say \u201cClick Track\u201d or Digital Metronome? You need to know the amount of BPM (beats per minute) or speed you are going to write the song in. Are you using a \u2018Live\u2019 drummer, or a drum machine? With a Live drummer you can either \u2018print\u2019 the click track on an empty track, or have the drummer monitor the \u2018clicks\u2019 while you are laying down your basic tracks. Whatever works for your team, but just an FYI, most local Rock drummers don\u2019t have good meter, so \u2018forcing\u2019 them to play with a click track is going to do one of two things: either improves it big time, or results in an uninspired performance. So don\u2019t forget, the click track goes on first or concurrently. Once it\u2019s on, you\u2019ll always have that point of reference. Another FYI, if the drummer monitors the click track while recording, he will eventually go off the track and speed up. But if the drum track is good and has \u201cfeel\u201d, once the drums are on the tracks you can erase the click track. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "If the band has a live drummer it\u2019s his job to keep the band together with the track. Possibly a click track (metronome) in his ear that\u2019s in sync with the backing track. Then the band needs to play with the drummer. If the drummer is on the track and not live, then it\u2019s easier - the band still needs to listen to the drummer. Having a four count click (at tempo!) before the songs starts will also help everyone stay together. ",
