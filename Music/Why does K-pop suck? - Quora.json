            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on what you mean by k-pop. The industry? The music? The fans? The idols? When it comes to the industry, there\u2019s a LOT of reasons it sucks. Where do I start? Profiting off of vulnerable teenagers? Overworked and exploited idols? Harsh beauty standards and diets? Mental health problems? Mistreatment of foreign idols? Unfair line distribution and screen time, toxic fandoms, lawsuits? There\u2019s so much wrong with the industry, but that\u2019s true of any industry anywhere. ESPECIALLY entertainment fields. I\u2019m sure there are people who are a lot smarter and a lot more well-researched than me who have talked about the problems within the industry, so I\u2019m not going to talk too much about it. If you mean the music and the idols? Well, let\u2019s be honest here, not all of the music is good, and not every single idol is a good, talented person. But for the most part, k-pop really isn\u2019t as cringe-worthy or weird as people think it is. If it doesn\u2019t fall to your personal taste? Completely fine! Nothing wrong with that. But art is subjective, and if it\u2019s something that other people enjoy, I don\u2019t see the point in going around saying it sucks. Especially when most idols are so hardworking and talented. If you mean the fans\u2026.. well, I won\u2019t argue with you. The fans suck. K-pop fandoms can be great in a lot of ways, but there\u2019s also a TON of toxicity, which again, I\u2019m sure someone much smarter and more well-researched than me has talked about before. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that K-pop itself sucks. But rather a lot of the things that are connected to it. Examples: Fandom warsBeauty standardSaesang fansExtortion of IdolsBlacklisting by companies(JYJ\u2019s situation got a Korean law named after them.)Working to death(\u201cPerfect is not enough. Like greed it\u2019s limitless.\u201d)Malicious commentsMental health problems(Became undeniable due to events in the recent years)Rigged award shows(MAMA is the icon for this)Difference in treatment/respect depending on popularity(An idol stated once that the same people treated her differently depending on for which group she promoted. When she was part of I.O.I, people treated her respectfully. When she was with back with her original group, people ignored her.)\u201cDon\u2019t mention/praise Japan even though we get a lot of money from there and it\u2019s one of the easiest places for our idols to vacation in.\u201d(This isn\u2019t mentioned directly but that message is often spread. Japan feels like a taboo topic at times. But yet it can\u2019t be denied that it\u2019s a rather rich neighbour where Idols can easily go to whenever extra money is needed or a \u201cforeign\u201d travel blog should be filmed.)\u201cWitchhunts\u201d(Everything is labeled as \u201cevil\u201d as long as the target still appears in public. TOP was criticized for being dressed properly for his court appointment. Seungri was criticized when he visited his teacher during the recognized Korean holiday \u201cTeacher\u2019s day\u201d and currently for not being \u201crestrained\u201d despite complying with everything that court wants from him.)\u201cThe most famous one is the scapegoat\u201d(\u201cThe Secret Chatroom Scandal\u201d: Jung Joon-youn was the worst one and it was mainly his scandal. Yet Seungri was named every single time, even when the article didn\u2019t mention him except for the headline or introduction.)Double-standards regarding genders(During sexiness, women are bad. During surprise pregnancies, men are bad.)The overshadowing of other genres(Some people label other genres as unimportant due to not being K-pop.)The that \u201conly one group exists\u201d(Some people act as if K-pop=BTS. Other groups/artists do exist.)\u201cThat everything originates from K-pop\u201d(\u201cBTS\u201d in movie captions generally stands for \u201cBehind the scenes\u201d. This term is older than the K-pop group.)",
