            "answer_text": "After you are dead and buried. The better argument would be that you are too old not to be training. At what age is better physical fitness, flexibility and self improvement not beneficial? There are techniques within certain systems that probably be left to the younger practitioners. For example, the risk to benefit ratio for jump kicks would lead me to advise against their practice for most adults over 25 even if you are one of the people who enjoy doing them. Also, striving for a full contact title may not be in the cards for someone who begins their training after 70, but there are many people who can gain mental and physical benefits from beginning at that age. There is a common misconception that martial arts is an activity for children and especially that if you\u2019re no longer a child, it\u2019s \u201ctoo late\u201d for you to begin training. \u201cMartial arts\u201d means military arts and until the \u201870\u2019s, children in classes were the exception rather than the rule. Training was geared towards young adult males and the children and women who participated were the ones who could adapt to that format. I was already a Black Belt Instructor when the original KARAT\u00c9 KID film came out and other than the benefits and value for kids portrayed in the TV series KUNG FU, this was the first time mainstream parents saw real value for enrolling their kids in MA schools. Unfortunately, most schools were not prepared to teach kids well. As an industry, it was a lost opportunity (as well as the kids). This motivated a large percentage of Instructors to become better educated at how to be better teachers in general and for a more diverse audience including kids, women and older adults. Not just using the WOW principle (weed out the wimps) to turn fairly tough young men, physically and mentally, into far tougher ones through basically an elimination process-type training. The problem is that many schools achieved their goals a bit too well and as an industry it cane back to bite us. As an industry, many people in the general public have pigeonholed us as a \u201ckids activity\u201d, especially for \u201cwimpy kids\u201d. A far cry from the hardcore training of earlier generations. While some schools have become daycares in funny pajamas, IMO a balanced approach of better teaching methods for students of all ages and genders, but not watering down the standards for advanced students and especially Black Belts is the way to go. I believe that the better schools and instructors can help a much more diverse group reach their potential and the same heights that the very select few did back in the day. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not, and I say that without having any idea whether you are 19 or 99. Martial arts encompass a wide range of practices from archery to wrestling, from karate to Filipino knife-fighting, from Brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ) to fencing. Some involve greater physicality, stamina, strength and speed, making it more challenging for older practitioners, but almost all permit beginners to learn and practice regardless of age. Taking BJJ or Muay Thai as examples of the more demanding arts, I have seen people well past retirement age take up the journey and make considerable progress, achieving a level of proficiency that would allow them to take down an assailant half their age and twice their size. Most importantly, their studies help them understand the risks posed and how to mitigate them, and when the threats are active, they have a framework of how to deal with them. Of course, a practitioner who begins studying at age fifty is unlikely to be a match for someone with a similar level of experience who began training at the age of twenty, but I have seen notable exceptions. Importantly skills levels play a big part and esepcially in the first few years, a year or two can make a huge difference. After three years of training BJJ (when I was in my late forties) I would regular spar with opponents 20\u201330 years younger and sometimes 100 lbs or more heavier with slightly less ability and regularly tap them out. I rolled with a(n active) professional NFL player with only a year\u2019s experience and submitted him time and time again until he stopped from exhaustion. While the best martial artists usually start very young, one of my teachers - the legendary John Danaher - didn\u2019t start training until he was 28 years old. Studying under our sensei Renzo Gracie, he applied himself with the zeal of a convert and the intellectual rigor of the graduate philophy student that he was at the time, training more than 12 hours a day. While he never competed - he believed that a pre-existing injury would prevent him from being the world champion he felt he might otherwise be - today he can count UFC champions Georges St Pierre and Chris Weidman as among his students, as well as submission grappling champions Garry Tonon, Gordon Ryan and Eddie Cummings. Some martial arts like BJJ take longer than others. The average time to receive a black belt is about 12\u201314 years of training consistently several times a week. Nevertheless, one of the inspiring moments I have witnessed was when one of my classmates received his in his mid-seventies, with tears in his eyes. So again, while I have no idea how old you are or what art you are interested in, I would give 100\u20131 odds and comfortably bet NO. ",

            "answer_text": "Every year my martial arts association gathers at noon on New Year\u2019s Day on the shore of a mountain lake. Specifically this one:  For advanced ranks, it\u2019s a requirement that you show up if it is at all physically possible for you to do so. No joke, a few hundred of us show up here every year. The thing is\u2026 we don\u2019t just show up to the lake and sing songs and stand around the bonfire. We jump in the lake.  Is it cold? Of course it\u2019s cold. It\u2019s really freaking cold. Sort of thing you expect a bunch of crazy young people to do\u2026 right?  Wait\u2026. wait\u2026 who\u2019s that guy in the middle with no hair? Gotta be a parent right? Surely he\u2019s too old for this nonsense\u2026 Well, yeah, he\u2019s a parent but he\u2019s also one of the dirtiest middle weight fighters I\u2019ve had the privilege to train with. The last time I had the opportunity to work out with him he kicked me in the head and then got this big grin on his face. \u201cI\u2019m making it a point at this workout to kick everyone in the head, to show people that I\u2019m 50 and I still can.\u201d Years before that, on a particularly blustery new year\u2019s day with high winds and driving rain, I stood on the shore with my school brothers and sisters and we all started complaining. Standing there, soaked to the skin, we felt like jumping in the lake should be optional\u2026 the lake had already come to us! We groused, we complained, and then\u2026 then this old guy started walking towards us. We all kind of looked at him confused until someone said \u201cBernie? Are you here to take pictures?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI started this twenty years ago and I told Sifu that if I lived to 75 then I would jump in the lake with you guys. Well, I\u2019m 75 this year and I\u2019m jumping in the lake.\u201d At which point we all lost our ability to complain and got ready to jump in the lake. The point is that you\u2019re never \u201ctoo old.\u201d I\u2019ve taken a kick to the groin cup from a 65 year old grandmother that was forceful enough to crack it\u2026 she finished her black belt at 67. I\u2019ve been standing next to the ring when a 45 year old instructor knocked someone unconscious with a finger whip. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s never too late to do something that matters to you, so if that thing is Martial Arts\u2026 then go for it, whether you\u2019re 23, 43 or 73. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, good for you! Martial Arts are great at improving your physique! You're never too old to learn new things! I see that you have received many great answers already. The main point is, of course, are you in trouble with someone already? Cause the best way to avoid violence and potentially get hurt is to run. Someone posted a question a while ago on Quora that stated: \u201c is parkour or free running the best way of self-defence?\u201d I thought it was a fascinating question because getting away quickly from a fight or violence is always your best choice; however if this is not possible and your only option is fighting I would do the following to prepare for that scenario; In a lot of the answers you've gotten already the main point is don't choose a martial art style with lots of fancy moves. Trust me. You will not remember one single bit of your training once high on adrenalin. Your body will function on auto-pilot. Your body, however, will forget moves you have practised a 1000 times. I've been in lots of fights as security or blind violence on the street. I have a background from Judo, Boxing and Krav Maga. The latter one from the army. In all my fights, it's boxing who have saved me over and over. Practising Boxing may look easy but managing to punch hard while moving in all directions is not easy, trust me. If you look on YouTube, you will see that it is boxing who dominates the street fight subject and you will often see one guy easily defeating several opponents one by one. If you take a close look, you will see that in most of the clips, the person being subjected to the violence moves all the time. And if you are lucky you can punch your way out of the situation you're in. Boxing makes you punch in combos of either 3,4,5 or 6 punch combos. You practice the jab, cross, hook and uppercut a thousand times. You also learn to control your body while high on adrenalin until punching, slip and roll become natural. Keeping your guard up and focus while your adrenaline is pumping. You learn to take punishment. And what makes boxing stick out from the rest mentioned before are full contact sparring! The reason why I'm suggesting boxing instead of Krav Maga and Judo or any other type of Martial Arts are the following: You do not take your opponent to the ground, lying on the ground makes you a target for bystanders etc.Judo is full of fancy moves that you've forgotten when you need it.You need to keep your balance and continue to move.Kicks are great but if your not a 100 % sure that you will be able to keep your balance and not let your opponent grab a hold of your leg. Kicking is no go.Krav Maga is great for combat. You teach how to go for your opponents soft spots. But when push comes to show Krav Maga stills practice striking in full contact the same way as boxing. When I've trained Krav Maga with other students, my superior striking skills from Boxing makes me win 10 out of 10 fights. Even against the instructor. This is becouse they don't practice enough full contact sparring.Anyway it's up to you, see what's in your vicinity and go for the gym that lets you do full contact sparring. ",

            "answer_text": "Here's my take on the subject\u2026 For every individual, the answer will be different. I base my perspective on the fact that each and every person possesses unique characteristics which will substantially impact their own personal experiences. To address the question, \u201cis it too late for you?\u201d\u2026 well\u2026 only you can decide that. If learning a martial art is truly a deeply desired passion of yours, you should absolutely pursue it! Speaking from personal experience, training in martial arts after age 30 is definitely a challenge but not impossible by any means! As my story goes, I became involved in martial arts in my early teenage years and remained active until my early twenties. At that point- life, responsibilities, a general lack of motivation along with the pursuit of different interests (women) distracted me so much that I eventually discontinued my training. Over the next several years, I worked primarily as a laborer, beating my body to a pulp and neglecting my health. I developed lingering physical limitations which I used as an excuse to further the neglect while blaming it on depression. I remained mostly sedentary for such a long time that my once chiseled physique became soft and nearly useless. At 34 years of age, (present time) I finally made the decision to break my self-destructive habits and improve my quality of life by improving my physical condition. I'm 6' 1\u2033 and I have a pretty \u201cstocky\" frame but my ideal weight range is 180-190 pounds. Due to my poor behavior, my weight had climbed to 246 pounds by the time I finally started trying to make a difference. In February 2018, I returned to my former martial arts school after 15-16 years of being inactive. It was rough! Watching the younger students effortlessly perform maneuvers that caused me physical pain to even think about attempting was discouraging to say the least. Yes\u2026 I had the advantage of remembering certain techniques that I learned so many years prior but I found out very quickly that I could no longer execute those techniques as a result of aging and my out of shape body. Nonetheless\u2026 I kept trying. The harder it was, the more I wanted! The pain was just motivation to improve. Now, only 5 months later, I have dropped down to 204 pounds and I feel stronger than ever! I do have a long way to go to reach my skill and fitness goals but with every class completed, every pound lost and every new technique learned, I only want it more and more. I'm not seeking competition level although I would definitely participate in competition should my skill level and the opportunity arise. I would just be curious what I'm capable of. My greatest concern is reaching peak physical fitness and learning my martial art style properly- hopefully earning the privilege of being a teacher with my own school one day. That goal probably seems unrealistic to some\u2026 but I won't stop trying. My Sifu often says, \u201cYou have never reached your full potential until you have run out of time.\u201d To me that suggests that as long as I'm still alive and well, I have the opportunity to improve. The possibilities are limitless. As far as selecting an appropriate martial art style for you, that would depend on a number of factors. Most importantly: what you plan to achieve from your training. Once you've decided that, you should explore the options that are available to you. Every martial system has a different focus with a different method for teaching along with techniques that are generally designed for different applications. Try out classes. Experience them before you decide. You may be fond of a particular style but the instruction or even the system itself doesn't live up to your expectations. You'll know when it's the right one for you. Remember to have patience. Developing a skill takes time. On top of that, acquiring the physical ability to harness that skill takes time. Practice every chance you get\u2026 not just while in class. Ask questions and ensure that you are practicing the techniques properly. There's nothing more frustrating than practicing something until it becomes a reflex only to find out later that you're doing it wrong. You'll have to retrain your body to correct a bad habit. Ultimately I think the best answer to the question is: \u201cThat's entirely up to you.\u201d Have confidence in yourself, seek what makes you happy and strive to be better tomorrow than you are today. I believe in you. I think you can become a phenomenal martial artist if that is what you truly want to do. Just be happy\u2026 whatever you choose. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally started training in American Jiu Jitsu (self defense, not grappling) 32 years ago at age 8 but have seen many older students come and go. Our oldest student is in his late 70s and  this past weekend I just had the pleasure of watching a 62 year old gentleman test alongside a 23 year old for the rank of 3rd degree black belt. Here are a few things I have noticed when students start at an older age:1) Age is an excuse, not a reason that should prevent you from doing anything.2) Be open to learning. It is sometimes hard for older, successful students to walk onto the mat and accept that they are doing something new and different.3) Reprogram your thinking. Children don't have enough time to develop bad habits so they learn quickly and easily. If you have been doing something for 25+ years and now someone tells you to do it differently you must accept that it will take same time to re-program your thinking.4) Know your limits. There is nothing wrong with working through techniques slowly or modifying them to fit your physical capabilities. I teach self defense so its easy to say that if you can't do something on the mat then you won't be able to do it in a life threatening situation either.5) Prioritize. When I was in college working toward my 2nd degree black belt I trained 4-5 hours /day at least 3 days per week. Then \"life\" happened. Insert job, wife, family of 3 kids and I'm lucky if I can hit the mat for a total of 3 hours in a week. This was tough for me at first and I postponed accepting any further rank until I realized that I was still growing tin the art and even if it wasn't on the mat. Jiu Jitsu becomes a part of you and if you keep priorities in check it always easy to find the time you need and appreciate the time you have. ",

            "answer_text": "Most martial arts are not suited to self-defense, unless they have altered the curriculum to work that way. Most martial arts teach you combat methods for times before the rule of law. If you live in an area where the rule of law doesn\u2019t work well or at all, then you might benefit from a martial-art. Otherwise look for someone that advertises self-defense training specifically. Signs of a good self-defense school: Trains you in situational awareness, and avoidance of situations were you might have to use violenceTrains you to use the appropriate levels of force for different situationsHas you train against resisting opponents, hopefully in heavy padding so you can use full force attacks.Doesn\u2019t teach fancy techniques - these usually fail in a real fight for beginners.Teaches you how to fall to the ground safely, and how to fight your way back up to a standing position - fighting from the ground only works in a duel or sporting competition.Signs of a good martial-arts school: Has you train against resisting opponents, hopefully in heavy padding so you can use full force attacks.Doesn\u2019t teach fancy techniques - these usually fail in a real fight for beginners.Teaches you how to fall to the ground safely, and how to fight your way back up to a standing position - fighting from the ground only works in a duel or sporting competition.Teaches the use of weapons easily available in your area, in combat you want all the force multipliers you can use. But doesn\u2019t teach you fancy disarms, these generally fail in actual combat.If you can\u2019t find a good school, you can make do with a mediocre school if you can find a partner with whom you can practice properly. Check out books/videos by Marc MacYoung, Rory Miller, Geoff Thompson, and Peyton Quinn; and for guns Masaad Ayoob and Jim Grover. Since you have internet access you can find a great deal of their material online and on YouTube. No matter what martial art you end up taking, those good gentleman can teach you how to use those skills for self-defense and combat. ",

            "answer_text": "I have to completely disagree with people who said that it's too late. I can't help but think these people have no experience with martial arts whatsoever, no offense to anyone. No, it is not late. It's never late, and that applies more than ever in MA. Let's get one thing straight here - it will take a LOT of time to get yourself to competition level. But, since you are looking to get fit and learn combat, you can start in 20 years and you still won't be late.  First of all, humans have adaptable bodies. If you train something, body will start reforming to allow it. Tendons, ligaments and muscles can stretch, and bone can get stronger. Training will shape you in a way that you need to be in order to be able to practice - and it only advances from there. Your 16 year old body has about 9 years of natural growth remaining - up to 25 years of age, your body is still shaping itself. To make a remark on most upvoted answer here, you do need to be able to set aside time for training. At one point, I am sure I will prefer spending time with my wife and kid to training. That is no bad thing, bad thing would be spending little free time you have training rather than with your family. On the other hand, you most likely will have enough time to go to dojo. Whatever case may be in your life, I assume you have about 8-10 years of not having too big a schedule. You can do a lot in 8-10 years in martial arts - you won't be a master, but you will know it really good and get really fit. So just go ahead and do it. I for example am a bit lazy to run. I never felt lazy to go and practice martial arts. I just love it. You know what ? Even if you are old, you like martial arts. So just go and start it. I assure you that you are not too old to start.  Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "No, you definitely aren\u2019t. Depending on the martial art and what are you going to use it for, it is much better to start it as young as you are able to. But the age at which I would consider one to be too old to get much experience into practicing a martial art would be about 35\u201340. (again, depending on how aggressive the martial art is) Some martial arts like Tai Chi are for your soul and you can start practicing it no matter how old you are. It was used for real fighting at its peak but it doesn\u2019t work anymore, for several reasons. (unless you make it work with about 30\u201340 years of experience, hah) Secondly, there is a difference between the martial art itself, which is made to kill, and the sport. Karate (especially shotokan) is turned into a sport, therefore by practicing that you won\u2019t beat another person who trains in traditional pencak silat because he will know how to punch and what to do in real life situations in which your sport spirit won\u2019t be useful. Get what I\u2019m trying to say? Most martial arts that are found everywhere are now sports (e.g. karate, taekwondo, judo, etc). Others that have little to no sport spirit you can find harder if not at all, depending on where you live. If you want something aggressive, useful and creative you should try going for pencak silat. If you want something that you\u2019ll be able to use even when you get older and lose your power, you should try wing chun. Be careful with this last one though, some styles are complete garbage and will not do you any good. The most important thing though: expect to get hurt. ",

            "answer_text": "No,  Not at all.  Age is not a bar for learning Martial Arts or anything. You might have gone through this beautiful quote:  The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. If not, assimilate it. There are several martial arts forms which are practiced for a variety of reasons: self-defense, competition, physical health and fitness, as well as mental, physical, and spiritual development. Choose your motif and start developing yourself as a martial artist.  But, certainly you will have to keep some important key aspects in mind before hitting the mates.  Recovery: You will need more rest to recover from training than your younger classmates. Unless you\u2019ve spent your entire life as a professional athlete before taking up martial arts you are going to suffer. Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking you don\u2019t need more recovery.Responsibility: Along with more recovery you\u2019re going to need to spend more time looking after yourself. If you get your arm broken you may find that your ability to earn money for your family and pay your mortgage is decreased.Relax: I know it seems counterintuitive, especially when you start to think that you\u2019ve already given up years of time to all those younger guys around you, but if you start going all out all the time you\u2019re going to quickly wind up hurt. Martial Art is a lifelong journey, not a sprint for the next two months. Display the kind of maturity you\u2019re supposed to have and accept that you are in this for the long haul.You think it\u2019s late, because you haven\u2019t practiced it yet.You\u2019re never too old.You\u2019re just untrained.Martial Arts is for you, just do it.

The last few years, I\u2019ve fallen somewhat out of shape, comparatively, due to a thyroid and sleep problems, and some depression taking the wind out of my sails a bit, (which is really kind of a lame excuse because martial arts can be great for depression.)  Anyway, I kept up with my training but not as intensely as before.I\u2019m 53 now and recently moved to Germany. I\u2019ve started at a new school that teaches a system I am new to but very interested in. It\u2019s extremely challenging and it\u2019s almost like being a beginner again.I say go for it. Just take care of yourself while you\u2019re at it. Diet/sleep/recovery\u2026.all that.Any form of external martial arts, if taught in the traditional and correct way, and provided you can find a teacher who follows in that tradition, will be extremely challenging, both physically and mentally. It will hurt. But it\u2019s a good hurt. Choose a teacher that will help you get the most out of the training with regard to your abilities, whether they be affected by your age or past injury. A good teacher will help you navigate your options in the training. Health, defensive ability, and emotional balance are reachable goals and well worthwhile. If you train hard and correctly it will happen, regardless of how old you are. Just be sensible and careful.Don\u2019t constantly compare yourself to those in your class who are half your age, but definitely use their skills to help sharpen your own. Competition ceases to be of vital importance when you\u2019re older. Your maturity might give you an edge over the younger ones in unexpected ways. Also, there are some older people out there doing some pretty amazing things. Be careful but not self-limiting. I say go get it, man. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re still young. Adult classes are often different from kids\u2019 classes which are in many cases watered down. Many of those who claim that Karate is useless just had kids\u2019 classes and not actual adult classes. Some dojos won\u2019t even teach people who are not adults. This is more common with smaller training groups that don\u2019t need kids\u2019 classes to keep their schools open. In the old days people did start learning martial arts in early childhood, but in modern times we don\u2019t need to prepare people to fight in a Medieval battlefield by their late teens or early 20s. No one will be an actual fighting knight or Samurai, and few Westerners will join the Shaolin Temple to live their lives as monks. Any references to needing to start training as young children refer to such contexts and not training for most people in the modern world. The best student I taught was in his 40s when he started. He was fit since he worked out, and he had some training as a teen (Tae Kwon Do IIRC,) but he wasn\u2019t serious until he decided to train when he was in his 40s. He followed instructions and had no ego, and he learned what I taught very quickly. At 23 you can train in any system and train in the full system, including things normally left out for older students such as acrobatics if that interests you. Don\u2019t wait until what you think is the ideal system opens a school near you. That is a common means of procrastination. Train in something. People usually don\u2019t find their primary system until training in various other systems. ",

            "answer_text": "In a word: no. I started Taekwon-do at the comparatively ripe old age of 41 and recently got my green belt. A few years ago, when I was about 35, I asked this question of someone, who took a negative view and said basically, he wouldn\u2019t advise it, that I would be too old and would lag behind everyone else. It\u2019s a great regret of mine that I listened to that person, because everything he said was total nonsense. It is never too late. I should not have listened to one word. Of course, you may have to manage your expectations to a certain degree: I know I will never be competing in major competitions against 20-year-old black belts. And that\u2019s absolutely fine. I am roughly 20 years older than the other beginners, and the ones who are the same age as me tend to be black belts of at least II degree. But without exception they have been welcoming and encouraging. Fitness wise I\u2019ve been surprised at my ability to keep up, but as the instructor pointed out, university students in their early 20s tend to go out drinking more, maybe smoke too, while I look after myself as I\u2019m more aware of those aches and pains that come when you hit 40. It also depends on your motivation: why you want to do it. Of course, the belts are welcome and it was a very proud moment for me to gain my latest one, as it proved I could do it, but simply put my main motivation was fitness. I have always been in pretty decent shape, but since I find gyms incredibly boring I need something - and more crucially, someone - to motivate me by telling me what to do. My body now moves and bends in ways it couldn\u2019t before and I\u2019ve never felt fitter or more confident. In confrontations - even just verbal ones - I used to shake and grow very nervous. Now, I stand my ground. We have a guy in our class who started aged 50. He is now in his 60s and a II degree black belt. So no, it\u2019s never too late, and don\u2019t make the mistake I did of listening to negative people who tell you otherwise. ",

Therfore it is better to learn the basics of every martial art and apply them according to your strength and weakness such as if you have weak skeltal frame therfore a  fast moving art would be better such as muay thai also Boxing will teach you to dodge attacks and finally Brazilian jiu-jitsu will give upper hand on larger foes but at the end of day you will always have a fight that you will win not because your techniques but your will to not fallAlso nijas trained in taijutsu meaning combat training and included techniques from aikido,jujutsu,judo,karate and kenpo Aikido,jujutsu and judo focuses on throwing,grappling and karate as well as kenpo focuses on striking ",

            "answer_text": "In general, the answer is no, absolutely not.  If you're like most people in your late 20s, your body is still relatively healthy and adaptable. I assume you have suffered no debilitating injuries in the past that hamper your normal everyday function. If you pay attention, train and practice regularly and seriously, and maintain a healthy lifestyle, there is no reason you can't become skilled at most martial arts. I will say that styles that feature kicking prominently (Thai and standard kickboxing, Tae Kwon Do, etc.) are easiest to learn when you're still young, as are more performance oriented disciplines (e.g. wushu, capoeira, and other styles that incorporate a good deal of acrobatic/jumping/flipping moves). But even there, all it means is that you will have to work a bit harder and perhaps it will take a bit longer. But hey, you're in your late 20s, you have plenty of time, right? What hinders most people, regardless of age, in their training is a deficiency in commitment and willingness to stick with their training when it becomes uncomfortable, difficult, or perhaps even boring. And no matter which style you choose, you're going to feel awkward and unskilled at first -- everyone does. The important thing is to stick with it, to give the art, and yourself, a chance to adapt and grow into it. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I'll tell you exactly what Ninja's actually do. And what I did. The martial art form is called Ninpo, It's popularly known as Ninjutsu, but is actually a higher version which encompasses mental as well spiritual training. The practitioners of Ninpo or Ninjutsu are called Ninja's. And to answer if you are able enough to practice martial arts; I started practicing martial arts when I was 15. After searching through almost all the martial art classes in the city, physically going to a few selected ones to check them out, I barely got satisfied with one training center. I immediately joined it but after getting bored with the training there, I soon left it and started practicing myself, teaching myself via the internet. Fast forward one year, I did a presentation in my high school, and then started my own club when I was 16.  The reason why I started my own club was because I felt that the training and teaching that was being imparted in my city was inadequate and incompetent. With almost no substantial skill training, no practicality in the art, and no  consideration of developing the mind, the martial arts just suffered. I decided to teach my very own concept of Martial Arts. (NB: Though I went to a martial arts class when I was a kid, I had to leave it due to some family reason, so it didn't really physically affect me much) ----- If I simply put it, there can never be a limit to learn something, not age, not place, not sex- whether it's martial arts, or just any other form of knowledge. The only limit that one can have is their will, be it for anything in life. I teach to both my fellow martial arts practitioners and to the people of a new intellectual/literary society I have just started with my friends (or just about anyone who discusses this with me) that there's one mantra you need to follow that will help you achieve and succeed in everything in life.  I call it the \"3D's: Dream, Determination and Discipline.\" You need to have a goal! You need to have a dream that you want to do something! It's perhaps the most important thing among the other D's. Unless you have a dream that you want to do something, you won't be able to do it! The next most important thing is to have an indomitable Determination to follow your Dream! And of course, Discipline; to work out the other two successfully, systematically and continously! \"You can BE whatever you want to BE, if you WANT to be.\" I'm 18 now.  ",

The Martial Art is an education about life - - your life, not anyone else's.  Don't be so concerned about \"mastering\" anything, but take up an activity for improving yourself today over where you were yesterday.  Take it up for improved health, and for your personal enjoyment.  As we grow older, we can modify the training and application to suit our needs and abilities, but it is never too late to learn, and eventually gain a mastery of the art.  Yes, you can master an art, but do not let that be the focus or a final goal, or a reason to do, or not do something. When deciding what to do with your life - which path to follow or which activity to undertake - don't be so concerned about how much time has past (as in, \"am I too old\"), but consider what positive things you can do with the time you have left.  Since none of us know how much longer we will live, never hesitate to try something new, and give it your best effort.  On one hand, train and prepare as though you will live a hundred years: on the other hand, approach each day with the enthusiasm, vigor, and enjoyment as though it was your last.  Bottom line is - - just do it! ",

If you really want to learn martial arts, your biggest roadblock won\u2019t be physical, it will be figuring out what wisdom applies where. For example, you will have developed a lifetime of habits. Some of them will inevitably be counter to your being able to become proficient in, or even to learn martial arts. Maybe it\u2019s diet. Maybe it\u2019s a low tolerance for listening to new ideas. If you can get past these types of impediments, you can definitely learn martial arts. If you have physical limitations, there are low impact options like tai chi. If you have slightly milder physical limitations, a weapon-oriented art like Kali, fencing, archery, or kendo might be useful. If you\u2019re in tip-top shape, then any art would do. Jiujitsu. Capoeira. Kung Fu. Whatever. Your only limitation will be your ability to absorb and internalize new ways of doing things. If you can figure out how to use your life experience to make good choices about learning something new, then you are ready to begin. Good luck. ",

However, I never committed fully to it even though I enjoyed it due to other responsibilities demanding more of my time. When I was in my mid-30s, I was in a car accident where my body was jarred and I had to get out of the car on a cold, rainy night for over an hour.  I'm not certain why, but it not only caused me back trouble temporarily, I ended up suffering with chronic asthma for the next few years, including several attacks where I was rushed to the hospital. After trying different methods and therapies to resolve this issue, I realized that throughout my younger years I was always extremely active with multiple sports and had also played trombone professionally (definitely an exercise for the lungs).  I decided to commit to training, and one day I walked into the Tae Kwon Do school adjacent to my church. The problem didn't immediately go away, but within a year of committing myself to working out multiple times a week, I totally resolved my problems with asthma and haven't had to use medicine or experience any attacks in over a decade.  I was 37 when I began training, and I earned my 3rd Dan (Black belt) before I switched and began training in Wing Chun.  Our school has people of all ages including two women and a man who are at least 65. ",

            "answer_text": "Too late to start learning martial arts?  Never!  You can learn martial arts at any age.  But 16 is still fairly young and is not late by any means.  If you really want to learn the type of martial arts that ninjas do (ninjutsu), be my guest, but I\u2019ll let you know that most ninjutsu schools nowadays are a complete joke and most of the stuff you will learn are going to be either ineffective for today\u2019s world, or completely impractical.  If you want to just learn impractical martial arts that \u201clook cool\u201d, but aren\u2019t actually going to help you in the real world, again be my guest.  You can learn Tricking and Xtreme Martial Arts if you want to learn how to do cool stunts. However, if you actually want to learn martial arts to be a real fighter who can handle themselves in MOST situations (because even the most trained guys can still lose or be killed), then I suggest you become a Mixed Martial Artist.  Not necessarily in the sense of competing in the UFC or some other MMA circuit (but you are definitely young enough to do that if you want to), but more in the sense of learning different Martial Arts that excel in different areas so that you are familiar with different types of combat and have your bases covered.  My recommendation would be to learn: -A striking art, such as Muay Thai, Kickboxing, or Sanshou.  Learn how to punch, kick, elbow, and knee your opponents. -A grappling art such as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  Learning how to fight and use leverage when you are on the ground. -An art based on real life situations like Krav Maga.  Learn how to neutralize threats in the most efficient way possible. Learning striking and grappling is good because you can spar with different opponents and really test your effectiveness against other people.  Those arts are practical, but limited because they have rules and are meant for sport so that\u2019s why you learn something like Krav Maga that is used for real life situations where there are no rules.   Try learning one art first, and then when you feel ready, learn the next one, and the next one.  It will be challenging, but as long as you keep an open mind, stay humble, and stay persistent, you can be a great fighter someday.   ",

            "answer_text": "The better answers here try to get at what you mean when you say \"master\". For the vast majority of schools in the west, getting a black belt is not mastery by any meaningful definition.  Here's a good way to think about study and mastery of any skill:   In the beginning, before you have studied a skill, you have nothing. No notions of how to do it. When you begin to study the skill, you learn basic forms/techniques. How to kick with power, how to punch with power, some stances. This is the worst you'll be at the skill you're learning, whether it's a martial art or painting. Get in a fight at this stage and you'll be bound by your partially learned forms, slowed down and confused when what you learned doesn't work. After a long time, you'll learn to do all the forms/techniques very well. At this point you can punch and kick and throw, etc. with proper form. You could be called an expert.Beyond being an expert, you need to drop your set forms and do whatever is appropriate, from moment to moment. You execute powerfully whatever you do. At this point you can say  that whatever you do is proper form, but you are seldom if ever doing the \"proper form\", per se. Because the last stage is not bound by form, it could be said to have more in common with the first stage than the second and third. You'll have come full circle. Back to your question: It's absolutely possible to master a martial art if you start older than 25, but it'll be extremely difficult. Mastery doesn't have to be the goal, though. Learning a martial art\u2014the whole journey\u2014is it's own reward. If mastery is your goal, the main thing that will get you there isn't youth, but dedication. Train every single day, hard and correctly, with proper instruction from a master. ",

Black belts were also expected to learn the Yang style long form Tai Chi, which I continue to practice to this day, usually doing the complete form 4 times a day. In Black Belt we were also taught the 62 two person forms that comprise the Djodo practice of sword and staff. I have continued to practice those Djodo forms 2 times per week for the past 17 years since I left that school. I still feel that I\u2019m making progress. It\u2019s not the destination, but the the journey there that is most rewarding in terms of self realization. BTW- it\u2019s not exactly a martial art, but I am now 71 years old and took up fencing at 69 years old. I recently place 12th in the Vet 50 division in my first US Fencing Assoc. tournament.

            "answer_text": "it's never too late to embark on anything! I've seen Chinese in their 60s and 70s working out in the gym. Last week, I overheard a conversation when we were in the elevator, with the old Chinese lady (60s) saying that she has undergone 5 major medical operations while still insisting on the aerobics in the gym almost everyday. Compared with the free combat, the martial art is more of a performance. As a matter of fact, the martial art is an umbrella term incorporating Chinese philosophy and medicine especially acupuncture and orthopaedics. So, if you are more intrigued in the Chinese culture, you'd take a stab at these subjects. For example, my Dad's addicted to martial arts since his highschool, so he self-studied martial arts(epsecially the twisting of joints and he'd tell me which part of my arm he'd twist before he punished me), the Chinese medicine(tried my broken ankle once and ruined it), acupunture, Chinese ink and taiji. Later, he held an exhibition of his painting almost every year. So, learning martial arts means more than Jackie Chan or Bruce Li in traditional Chinese sense, ok? How about start it ASAP, maybe next week? Did I mention an anecdotal experience by my student who is now in the US studying AI and mentioned that he once went to Inner mongolia to combat the wolves with bare hands under the guidence of his master (\u5e08\u5085\uff09? He  showed his disdain for the term \"martial arts\" and insisted on calling it \"Guoshu\" (\u56fd\u672f\uff09, which he started learning at 5. And he has to learn ancient Chinese guqin, a seven-stringed plucked instrument in some ways similar to the zither\uff0cthe Book of Changes (\u6613\u7ecf\uff09, together with the combat strategies from his master for free. OK, i'd rather think he's either a nut or a genius. And you don't have to learn these things, so starting from 16 is OK for me.  ",

            "answer_text": "My friend, anybody can do martial arts. I believe the question of which martial art you should do depends on how willing you are to commit to the martial art. If you want something more simple(believe me no martial arts are simple!) you should consider one of the following: Boxing Kickboxing Tai chi (very demanding on the mind however!) If you are willing to put in a decent amount of effort but you don't want it to consume your life you could go for many karate styles such as: Shotokan(I am a practitioner of this and hold a 2nd dan black belt) Goju-ryu  Uechi-ryu Kyokushin Or you could choose something non karate related such as:  Taekwondo (ITF or WTF) Brazilian Jiu jitsu Jiu jitsu Capora Krav maga There's loads more, perhaps you shouldresearch yourself! Karate has its own section because it's rather unique(there's many forms of it with different difficulty levels involved) also, karate is very similar to Chinese martial arts, however somehow have a very different feel to it. It's mainly in the body movements but also in the mind.  If you're willing to make a martial art your way of life there are extremes such as: Shaolin gong fu(do not even consider being a shoalin monk unless you're a Buddhist or you're willing to convert to Buddhism Many other forms of gong fu such as wing chun which is the style of yip man and his descendants such as Bruce lee!(who has his onw martial art which is called jeet kune do) and wushu which I believe has a larger focus on weapons than the previous mentioned martial arts However, the dream of being a real life ninja is very vague and it's fairly impossible in an urban environment, but if you would like to study this martial art, it is called ninjitsu or bujinkan.  Forgive me if anything I said was wrong :) I hope this is helpful.  ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Caroline!   Never is too late to start to learn something! Age is just a state of mind. The only thing to consider is the fact that the older we get, the more susceptible to injuries we become. I'm about to get my TKD B.B at age 28, but I'm writing from my experience as a skateboarder who stopped at the age of 19 (after 5 years of riding) and then grabbed the board again at age of 26. My body changed, gained weight and adapted to the rigor of the martial arts training. I used to jump sets varying from 6 to 18 stairs, and now i'm able to jump 10 stairs as a maximum because my joints start to hurt. So, the solution I found was to stretch a lot my whole body with proper exercises and it doesn't matter how old you are, because your body and your daily life will be more than grateful. The point is if someone has gained experience with any challenging physical activity, muscular memory can be helpful in order to ease the process of learning something complex like the Taekwondo is, because it requires explosivity, coordination, air/breathing management, power and precision. If not, well, the challenge will be more exciting because there is a lot of stretching to be done. ;) Best regards. ",

            "answer_text": "I did taekwondo in my early twenties and then stopped at blue belt.  I started taking it again when I was 40.  I got my black belt just before my 45th birthday.  It takes a little longer to recover from workouts and my flexibility isn't quite what it was at 22, but it's not that far off.  I am also a little slower than some of the better teenagers and twenty-somethings, but I am stronger and rely on technique and guile more than athleticism when I spar to make up for it.  I started by taking class 2-3 times a week for the first couple of years and am now able to do 5 classes a week .  I am twenty pounds lighter and have much more endurance now than I did 10 years ago.  You should be fine at 31 years old.  It may not be easy, but nothing that is worth the effort ever is. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I started studying Aikido in my 40's. Of course you have to consider your own level of fitness and athleticism. I would not have studied Karate or any of the other kicking striking arts as my knees would not handle it and that is not what I wanted. I did not anticipate getting into fist fights which is what they teach. We in Aikido and Judo say, \"you have to be willing to take a punch to land a punch.\" My son called Aikido \"old man Judo\" as it does not include grappling on the mat. It involves throws and joint locks and if done correctly does not require a strength. It involves timing and balance breaking and movement. Sadly most Judo and some Aikido have mutated to nothing more than an exercise in brute strength. Watch some YouTube clips of Olympic Judo. It has weight classes and rightfully so because it is nothing more than brute strength grappling thanks to the work of the Scandinavians in the 1960's. Aikido too has succumbed to the macho knuckle draggers who think the way to throw someone is to use pain as a compliance tool. \"Crank\" on their wrist and they'll follow the throw. That is not the way it is supposed to work. To crank anything requires you exert force and to do that you have to plant your feet and use strength, unless you can do it while moving using your body mass. Still pain is a poor compliance tool. Watch any police video of them attempting to get a suspect to comply while administering pain. It does not work, but the dumbass cops can't get it through their heads. Rodney King was getting the snot beat out of him by nearly ten cops with clubs and he still would not comply. Why? Because he wanted to stop the pain. You don't just lay down and let it continue while you're getting beaten. You put the perp in a position where HE can control the pain. If he tries to get free it hurts, if he stays still it doesn't. Which do you think he'll do? It is quite different than having ten different macho jacked up bullies pounding on your ass with clubs everyone screaming at you to lay still. If it wasn't so sad and pitiful it would be funny. But Police departments never learn and instead of teaching methods that take time to learn, they shoot people, its easier, cheaper and appeals more to the type of people who want to be cops. So yes, you can learn in your thirties, but as I said, make sure you learn one that is within your physical capabilities and that you understand the learning curve. You might be breaking pine boards in a month or two which will be great the next time you are attacked by a pine board. There is a big difference between efficacy and someone masturbating your ego. There are a lot of chains dojos that specialize in draining parent's wallets as they act as glorified after school daycares. They don't teach anything useful and they know it. We have a saying that is similar to the military. Train like you fight. It is all about muscle memory. In a fight you don't have time to think, so if you train in the dojo with all the bullshit trappings of being Japanese or competition, then don't expect to be able to just adjust to a street fight when someone jumps out at you. You are more likely to bow to your assailant before you defend yourself, since that is what you practice over and over again. Muscle memory that is what it is all about.Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "From my own experience at 25 you can still easily learn most martial arts. I would say the most important thing is your drive. Someone who is motivated, analyzes the movements carefully and is interested in his art outside of the dojo will be able to master a martial art faster than someone who just shows up for training, regardless of age. Willing to train (by yourself) is way more important than age if you want to master a martial art. It is true some techniques are a lot easier to learn when you are younger. Learning to roll and fall safely is often essential and it is a lot easier when you are younger. Your body can take a bit punishment and is more lenient if you make a mistake. For kids it's even easier, as the their fall to the ground is shorter. I have seen 50+ year old can still learn this, altough they should expect to need a bit more time before they are able to develop a good technique and automate it. However most of mastering an art is not related to body fitness, but about learning, fine-tuning and automating movements, understanding the 'system/art' and what is and isn't important in that system. Age is only a very minor influence on these things, especially compared to things as motivation and teaching method. Increased life experience could even be a benefit. ",

It can be the morals and values of a martial artist, or visually understanding techniques and concepts of the art. Let\u2019s break it down. If you\u2019re able-bodied: Take it slow. Always take it slow when learning a new physical skill. It helps to train your muscle memory properly and reduces chance of injury. I learned in my Parkour phase a term that you have to go by, progressions. That\u2019s breaking down a technique into multiple progressions or \u201csteps\u201d you take to complete the technique/trick. Never too late to get some professional instruction or learning basic fundamentals at home via internet. Of course, be smart about the source. If you\u2019re not able-bodied: Don\u2019t fret, there\u2019s still much to observe and absorb just by watching and learning from other practitioners. Watch videos, live demonstrations. Read articles and instructions on the martial art. Any kind of learning is still learning. Learning doesn\u2019t stop until you choose to. You might be limited to how much you can learn. But, it\u2019s still learning regardless. Good luck on your journey of never ending learning. AP ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly, it is not too late to start any endeavor at any age. With daily practice, undying dedication, hard work, blood, sweat and tears, you'll eventually be proficient. But you really must let go of the word master, which ultimately conjures up other related words like expert and undefeatable. As you become advanced in your studies, you'll eventually let go of these concepts on your own.  You'll eventually realize that the more you know and learn, the more you will realize how little you know and how little you've have learned (in the grand scheme of things). I know one guy who has been practicing daily for 45 years (since the age of 10) and would never, under any circumstances, refer to himself as a master.  Although he could likely kill me with a single blow, he would refer to himself as a student, said in the spirit that learning is a never-ending process.  Once we achieve mastery, we fail to learn and improve ourselves. ",

A lot of masters have had people joining their training for the first time even in their 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. I am 38 now, when I started learning Parkour I had already crossed 27 and I have always been learning different kinds of martial arts or physical disciplines. I am right now thinking of learning Wing Chun Kung Fu which I always wanted to learn but wasn't able to due to the unavailability of anyone teaching that Martial art here in India . I have found a few classes a some months back and might join. I am a life long learner and even if I am in my 90\u2019s I will keep learn things if I really want to learn them. So do not worry and just go and join it. No one is forcing you to become the next Bruce Lee in a month. Just have fun and practice safely. ",

            "answer_text": "If you can stand and adequately walk then you are not too old. I am familiar with internal Chinese martial arts. The internal styles do not start off requiring a great deal of athleticism. I was fortunate enough to have found a true master and gained knowledge of Tai Chi, Baqua, and (something I believe to be an internal style) Loon Ying which is known as Dragon Style. I mainly practiced Tai Chi. I practiced diligently for over ten year. I had a lifestyle in which I repeatedly became engaged in no holds barred combat. I have natural fighting skills, like hand speed and reflex, but I could feel pronounced affects from my practice. I could feel the evolution my ability. Probably the most obvious thing was learning to engage and flow with the force that was trying to hurt me. What I\u2019m getting at is that these martial arts can be very effective in an actual fight. These martial arts can be started at any age. If you are really old then a lot of your natural ability to fight becomes diminished but learning these kinds of martial arts will augment whatever you have. Also, learning these arts will provide an excellent path to good health. ",

I was 25 at the time. About a year later, I had accepted a new job and was looking for new things to try and I decided to walk into a Brazilian Jiu-jitsu school. About 18 months later I train as much as I can and I love the sport/art more and more everyday. I can honestly say it\u2019s been one of the most positive developments in my life and something that I will continue to do until my body fails me to the point where I\u2019m \u201can old guy who can\u2019t roll anymore\u201d.

            "answer_text": "In the older days, most martial arts masters would not even accept students younger than 18, since the young kids do not have sufficient skill/stamina/intellect to understand certain practices. Only with the popularization and commercialism of martial arts would you get 8 year olds with black belts. The whole sanctity of these belts, which is supposed to symbolize skill and seniority, have been thrown out of the window once \"masters\" easily recognized how these belts are really cash cows. So to answer your question, NO. Ideally, a martial artist should start around 18, but abit later than that is fine as long as you are willing to put in the extra effort. The only problem i see is that you may not be as flexible as the younger martial artists who have been stretching their limbs for a long time. Not really big deal though. ",

I have trained in Martial Arts of some kind since I was about 12 as I was always interested from a very young age.  Take this time to engage yourself in an activity that doesn't take an incredible amount of atheticism, at first at least. You will gain all the necessary traits to garner that athleticism you lack now. On top of the obvious, learning an art is empowering and it's something anyone at any age can participate in, given good health. You will find that you gain strength, agility, speed, quickness and eventually, athleticism will come. Usually, athleticism comes from participating in a given activity over a given time period. It would very much help your life no matter your position. I've never heard of it not benefiting the participant. So get involved! Be certain you do a little study on the gym as it can be big money in certain cities with certain instructors.  ",

But, an experienced Sifu will be able to make a more informed decision after having worked with you for a short period of time. If you\u2019re looking to increase pain thresholds, then BJJ or a Kung Fu that emphasizes Chin Na (seizing and grasping) or Shuai Jiao (Chinese fast wrestling) might be of interest. Regardless of the system (Krav Maga, BJJ, Hung Gar, etc.), a competent instructor is a key requirement. Don\u2019t sign any long-term contracts until you see how they run classes and find if they actually teach the martial side of martial arts. ",

You learn how to adapt yourself to your opponent. ",

You might want to avoid styles that have full contact sparring or practice. That being said I know people that started learning Jiu-jitsu at the age of 60. Of course they practiced other martial arts before so they weren't complete beginners. But this may give you an idea of what is possible. Good luck and have fun! ",

In my parent art of Kyulyun Taekkyon, people younger than 13 were forbidden to train due to a lack of any kind of emotional maturity. 18 is a good age to start, as you are basically in your physical prime. Be mindful of your attitude, though- while in your physical prime, your brain is not yet fully developed and, with it, your emotional maturity. Don\u2019t take this as a slight- consider that most people never reach emotional maturity, stalling out at around 16. Take good notes and pay attention to your teacher. You could go very far, provided you keep your mind and attitude in check. Be respectful- if you are from the US, that alone is going to be a challenge if you\u2019re like most of our young people these days. If you can do these and persist in your lessons, you\u2019ll do well. ",

The main thing to be careful about is not age as such, but matching your physical and mental capabilities to the style of martial art. If you have osteopenia or something else making your bones more likely to fracture, you probably don\u2019t want to start doing an art that emphasizes throws or bone-breaking blows. (E.g., judo / aikido / Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, etc.) If you have pulmonary problems, arts involving lots of stamina training will probably be frustrating. And so on. A slight plug, since I teach it: This is a reason T\u2019ai Chi is associated with older folks. It really isn\u2019t old people stuff - the best practitioners started when they were just past puberty - but at least it isn\u2019t actively damaging to your body, as some others may be. But avoid the people who insist on woo-woo pyramid power pure peace things they call T\u2019ai Chi. It is a martial art, and has to be taught as such to get anything out of it. Finally, anybody can learn some form of self-defense, and should. ",

To be clear, there are forms of Tai Chi still offering martial or combative value. Most anyone can do (Ryabko) Systema. Karate (type) training can be very tough on old knees (and other joints.) With the right school/teacher, BJJ (jiu-jitsu) can still work especially if you have flexibility and some strength or physical coordination, but don\u2019t let a bunch of young guys abuse you as a mat dummy.

As my old man always says \u201cnever put off till tomorrow what can be done today\u201d! If you start your journey today you will look back in years to come and ask yourself how you ever coped without Martial arts.

            "answer_text": "23? How can an ancient like you even think of starting martial arts training? I am 69. I started aikido in my early 30s. Despite a 13 year hiatus, I am still practicing it, finally buckled down and passed the shodan test two years ago. Spent this past weekend at a seminar at one dojo in our area, 4\u20136 hours of training each day on Fri and Sat. About a year ago, I started classes in tang soo do, a Korean form of karate. So I am hoicking my old body across the mat trying to keep up with fellow students in their teens and 20s. A good challenge to keep the muscles limber and the heart rate up, as well as expanding my skill set. I am not some aging fitness fan\u2026I am overweight, work at a desk, heck, I am a type 2 diabetic\u2026so this is how I plan to stay alive and relatively healthy. Now I don\u2019t expect to become some fearsome sparring monster in tang soo do. I don\u2019t even have any great notion of going for second dan in aikido. I just do this because it is great fun and I love it, and as long as I can drag my bones onto the mat, I will keep doing it. So yes, you can starting practicing martial arts in your damn 20s ;-) ",

Per choosing a martial art or a school, it's all about the teacher.  So visit a few, meet the teacher(s), the students, etc.  The that feels like 'home' is the one.

After ten years of hard work he\u2019s got a successful self-defence training school, he teaches hundreds of people a year in seminars and many students view him as as one of the best in the country.

Sure you might not be at the level expected of your age and sure you may not be that skilled at the beginning but, martial arts is all about working on your mind and body. Because of that, you can start any time to improve your discipline while also improving your overall physical well being. Besides, some of the best MMA/UFC fighters are in there mid 40s and they're still kicking it. The only thing that could limit how well you do at martial arts is how you think. If you let your mind be calm and relaxed with no expectations for failure or success, you'll be surprised as to what your body can achieve. P.S, a lot of old men and women in china practice tai chi (a martial art) to stay fit and maintain a good body so believe me they can attest that anyone at any age could start learning martial arts.

He loves it so we enroll him. Everyday I would drive him down to the studio and sit on the bench and watch the training. At the time I worked with a guy that was a higher ranked Taekwondo guy.We would talk about what kido was learning. One day he turns to me and says \u201cI\u2019d love to have your son and you at my school but since you are already going down there, sitting for 1\u20132 hours a day why don\u2019t you get your ass out onto the mat?\u201d I didn\u2019t do it that day but a few weeks later I put on a gi, tied my white belt around my waist and never looked back.

Do weightlifting, far superior bang for your hours, increase bone density, strength etc. Statistically less injuries per hour trained in weightlifting. Of course if it is for the adrenalin then I reccomend taking up a bit of grappling, then boxing. Kicking really hurts after age 35 especially when receiving. ",

He now trundles along with the rest of us - sure there are things he can\u2019t do, but he has a great time and his fitness is improving - the other students love the guy, it\u2019s been good for everybody. Pick an art which suits your physical ability, and go from there. For instance, as a teenager, classical jujutsu was easy - I had the flexibility, no problem. Last weekend, I attended a seminar with two very skilled Finnish jujutsu teachers and found that 30 years on, I can\u2019t do that stuff any more. Too many injuries, can\u2019t bend like I used to. That\u2019s why I practice a low kicking, stand up art - I have the physical capabilities to be very good at what I study. You will too - just find the right thing. ",

Do something that makes you feel physically strong and empowered. P.S.- The reason I don\u2019t partake in classes myself is because of several complicated issues that would arise.

Seems to me like most people who learn Tai Chi / Bagua / Hsing Li do so later in life, often as a second or third art.

There's a theory that physical skills acquired before late teens are associated with brain development, ie there are neural pathways devoted to that skill, where as those developed as an adult are learned behaviour.  Hard-wiring vs software if you will.  Anyway, that's my excuse.  But you shouldn't let it stop you from enjoying martial arts, I don't regret it at all and remain quite active in both kendo and judo at age 52. ",

Those Arts depend a lot on muscular strength and at this point, the body doesn\u2019t have the recovery ability to train effectively. The same can be said with a few of the Southern Styles of Kung Fu as well. The Wudang schools are of course ideal. like Taijiquan, Bakuachang, and Xinyi.

If you're in reasonably good shape and apply yourself diligently, there is nothing to prevent you from being a capable martial artist. But be aware of your limitations. For example, a kicking art becomes difficult if you begin late, as flexibility becomes an issue. Your body structure is also important ie are you lean, heavyset etc. To ensure longevity in the sport, be smart in your training. You will not recover from injury as easily as an 18 year old.

Both are very deep arts and work together, if you have a skillful instructor in each, and can be used for self-defense if that is specifically taught. If you want to go into karate or other hard style, you may have trouble with it. I am 56 and just do not want to do all those things I used to do with Shotokan and Goju ryu, even though I think it would be so cool to be able to still pull them off. But now, to be realistic, tai chi is my best bet. Aikido my very close second choice. If all you want is self defense, there are courses on just that, so you don\u2019t have to engage in a formal art at all. ",

You can become proficient, you can find a movement system you enjoy, you can possibly learn to defend yourself. There is no age that is \"too old\" to start most of the accessible systems.  I would say that what is said about martial arts and age is analogous to any movement system.  Is 25 too old to aspire to be a prima ballerina?  Yes.  Is it too old to take up Argentine Tango and become amazing at it?  Not at all.   There is a great quote in one of Rory Miller's books that goes, \"Train in something that makes it a joy to move\" and another by Ueshiba, \"Never begin with results.\"  I wrote a blog post about picking a martial art school that can be found here: \"What Martial Art Should I Study?\" ",

Bottom line is as long as you're still breathing you can still learn and get better. Just look for an instructor who is willing and able to give you modifications if needed, due to any physical limitations. Best of luck on your martial journey! ",

What you start though really depends on what kind of places you have near you. Look up what some disciplines practiced around your area are and what dojos teach them, since you cant learn something like martial arts on your own. If you want a more concrete answer, what you want will depend on how much time you are willing to sink into learning. I myself started with boxing which evolved into later learning many different disciplines since boxing gives you a great base to work from. If you're willing to put some time into learning and commit to it, try to find a place that teaches muay thai, wrestling, or brazilian jujitsu. All three of them are great things to learn, with wrestling being the easiest to find and muay thai being the closest to the 'ninja feel' that you wanted since most martial arts that claim to be 'ninja like' are either impractical or useless in the long run.

Tai Chi and Aikido are fine, though Aikido can be hard on knees. Many Karate schools don\u2019t do contact sparring, and so are fairly safe. Basically look at a martial art like any other sport. Look at the training and see if your body can take it. ",
