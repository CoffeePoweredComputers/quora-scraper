            "answer_text": "Hey Harsh, thanks for requesting! Currently, my favorite Spotify playlist is the one they compose for people at the end of the year. Many of my favorite songs and covers are on this playlist. Lots of feel good songs that get me in an amazing mood. It\u2019s one of the great things about Spotify, among all of them. It\u2019s personalized to each person, which means no playlist is the same. To me, it shows me an overview of my year. As far as I can see, it goes in chronological order, from the start of the year, until late November/early December. It shows all of my moods throughout the year. It\u2019s like a musical diary. However, I realize that this playlist is only available at the end of the year, in the month of December, unless you save it to listen to later on. So. One of my favorite playlists on Spotify is the main playlist that I made. It consists of 3,533 songs currently. I listen to the playlist daily. Some of my favorite playlists that are made by Spotify aren\u2019t technically aren`t music, but rather sounds of rains and nature and such. Other of my favorite playlists that are made by Spotify that include actual music are mainly classical playlists, jazz playlists, instrumental playlists, country and rock and rock n` roll radios, etc.,. I listen to a mix of everything, but these are just some of my favorites. ",
