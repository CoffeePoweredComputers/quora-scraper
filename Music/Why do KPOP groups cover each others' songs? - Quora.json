            "answer_text": "It is usually younger groups covering an older group\u2019s once popular hit for either of the 2 reasons: to gain exposure for self or just to do a celebratory tribute. SHINee covered Super Junior\u2019s Sorry Sorry in 2012, at the height of their popularity. They clearly did not needed to ride the popularity of the sunbae song, but did it anyway to pay true respect to their sunbae using a celebratory mood. EXO and NCT covered the same song during their up and rising phase. The agency probably made them do it to ride the fame of the song to directly help in the groups\u2019 growth going forward. Irregardless of the reason behind idols covering songs, fans get pleasantly surprised when their favourite group pay tribute to an older sunbae song so it is a win for both parties. ",
