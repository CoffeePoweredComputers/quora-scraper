            "answer_text": "If you are not happy with the sound of your recordings, the software you are using (Known as a Digital Audio Workstation or DAW) is the least likely culprit. Garageband is capable of recording at the same bit rates, sample rates, and in the same file formats as professional DAWs. There are a few other places that you should look at first. Generally the signal path for sound going into a computer is microphone/intrument\u2192 preamp\u2192Analog to Digital Converter. Problems at any of those steps can significantly reduce the quality of a recording. Obviously the quality of your microphone is very important. It is impossible to get a good sounding recording with a bad microphone. Unlike other parts of your signal path that can introduce colors to your sound, your microphone creates the sound. If you didn\u2019t capture it at the moment, it is never coming back, so if your microphone has a narrow bandwidth, or does not capture the full range of frequencies, there is nothing to be done later to get that information back. Investing in a decent microphone is a must. The next step is the step most often overlooked, microphone preampfification. The most basic kind of microphone is called a dynamic microphone, this includes most every microphone seen outside recording studios and even some very popular professional microphones like the SM57. When a dynamic mic creates the electrical signal that travels down the microphone cable, it is powered only by the energy that exists in the vibrations of the air hitting the microphone. in other words, it is a very weak signal. In order to be usable in any kind of electronics, that signal has to be amplified or made louder. That stage of amplification is \u201cpreampfification\u201d not because it happens before amplification, but because before the signal can be useful it has to be \u201cpre-amplified\u201d. Your microphone preamp takes a tiny little sound and makes it a big one. If you have ever blown up a tiny picture into a big one, you know that you not only lose resolution, but you can also see all of the dust and dirt on the original picture. The bigger you make it, the worse it gets. If the mic pre isn't good, it can do the same thing to your sound. It can cause the loss of resolution and the addition of lots of noise. Having a good external mic-pre can make a huge difference, however most people have an audio interface with built in microphone preamps. The audio interface is the box that plugs into your computer on one side and the audio signal on the other and it does the last step, A to D conversion. Getting an audio interface with decent mic-pres can kill two birds with one stone. Once your signal is at a level that it can be processed, it it turned from analog electrical signals into digital computer data. Good converters are super important, but this is the least likely culprit. Any digital audio interfaces with good mic-pres will generally have pretty decent conversion. That being said, you should make sure that GarageBand is set to convert to a high quality file format. There are two measures of the quality of the format, but rate and sample rate. How high you can go with either is a function of the D to A converters. Make sure you are working at a minimum of 44.1 sample rate and 24bit and make sure you are using a non-compressed file format like WAV or AIFF. Good luck with your music. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Microphone placement and room acoustics are the main culprits for bad sound, NOT the software. You can get decent recordings with cheap gear if you place the microphones well and have good acoustics where you\u2019re recording. If you have hard floors, walls and ceiling you\u2019re going to get lots of echo and bad sound. If you have your mics placed poorly you\u2019re going to have poor sound. I\u2019d suggest doing a bit of research on just how to set up mics for your purpose. If that still gives bad results then check your mics, cables (unlikely, usually cables are either good or gone), mixer and A/D converter. Edited to add: I\u2019ve seen other answers about bad mics and that can be a factor, but you can get good results with cheaper microphones\u2026 while that $500 Sure is better than the $40 dynamic the cheapies I\u2019ve used are at least adequate for most purposes. Would I use them in a sound studio? Of course not, but if you\u2019re using consumer level software then you\u2019re probably not in a position to be using high end microphones. My field is Video Production so Audio isn\u2019t my primary focus but after close to 40 years I can hum the tune. I actually do use cheaper microphones for a lot of purposes and while I can tell the difference in the recording the biggest difference is in properly placing your microphones. A decent, inexpensive dynamic mic close to the instrument is much better than a $400 shotgun mic 10 feet away. After you get the mics set you\u2019ll need to get the mix right\u2026 this is what audio guys at big venues get paid big bucks for. And not infrequently screw the pooch, we\u2019ve all been to a live event where Captain Feedback made an appearance. Adjust the preamp to minimize the sensitivity of the microphones\u2026 you want them to hear what\u2019s RIGHT THERE in front of them, not the other instruments or monitors a few feet away. A bad mix will destroy the sound quicker than anything else short of a power failure. Listen to each mic with the solo switch, turn the preamp down, then slowly turn it up until you hear the subject but DON\u2019T hear anything else. Repeat this for each mic or instrument you\u2019re recording. After the preamps are set then bring the faders up so you easily hear the channel. Repeat individually for each channel in solo then listen to all of them together and balance them against one another. This part is more art than science, and it\u2019s what the audio tech is supposed to bring to the table. If you\u2019re not an expert (I certainly am NOT at audio) it\u2019ll likely take you a bit to get a decent mix. A good set of over the ear noise cancelling headphones are a godsend here; the Bose I bought 15 years ago were one of the better investments I ever made. I very rarely have to do anything complicated with audio in my business so when I do I\u2019m not as good as an Audio Tech. There\u2019s lots of shortcuts I\u2019ve seen them do that for me are magic. I have to fall back on trial and error backed up by College courses back in 1984 and my years of experience in Video production watching and occasionally having to muddle my way through doing audio. That reminds me of a Wayne Newton concert I was at about 20 years ago, the audio was so bad at the start that Wayne had his own audio guy (the guy was also his main bodyguard, a HUGE man who went by the name of Bear) go to the board and physically moved the facility guy out of the way. 2 songs later the audio was perfect. Like I said, magic. I\u2019d casually known both Wayne and Bear for years and never knew he knew sound. ",
