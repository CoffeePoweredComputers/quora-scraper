            "answer_text": "The one that got away -- regretfully -- can either be won back with honesty, charm and persistence, or not.  If I were asked by a man I loved with all my heart and soul to return, and if I still loved him, I would -- even if I was involved in another relationship. An old tune goes something like this: If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with. I think human beings are capable of many kinds of love. So if the love of my life wanted to die in my arms, and if I wanted to die in his arms, I would do whatever it took to make that happen, including leaving someone else. The OP states he doesn't want to intrude on her new relationship. Why not? If she and her current partner are married and/or made a commitment to one another, then that commitment could be/should be considered in light of her true feelings. Does she feel the same way toward you? With new information (that you still love her) she may need to reevaluate her feelings for her current partner. If she feels differently now, if she's gotten over you, then here is how to get over her: 1.  Give up. She was unique and there is no other like her. Don't even try to think anyone else can compare. No one else can. We are all unique and different. You lost that time, and you won't lose again. When you see it/feel it, you WILL know it. Give yourself time. Five years isn't enough. Sometimes it takes twenty. 2. Because every woman is unique, try to fully understand each woman you do meet. Focus on their unique qualities. Your comparison of one woman to another is like comparing Mars to Pluto, or roses to peonies, or apples and oranges. Yes, planets, flowers and fruit are categories of things just as 'women' are categories of things. But if you don't distinguish between each individual one at a very discerning and careful level, you are missing out on fascinating and important distinctions in life. 3. Know that nobody leaves a failed relationship feeling like a success. The relationship failed because you were too preoccupied (both of you) to place your relationship first, and worklife second. It was a choice you made that seemed right at the time. Well, relationships don't thrive -- they fail -- when they are not a priority. Maybe if you learn this, you will have a better chance to reclaim the kind of joy you experienced with her, again, -- or you will experience it with another IF you place the relationship as your first priority. 4. We all make choices we live to regret. Otherwise we would not be human. Give yourself the room to have feelings of regret. You need time to understand your true priorities, and a paradigm shift in your thinking in order to get over her. 5. When you put your true feelings first, everything else in life falls into place. Do not be such a practical person as to wrongly select cognitive needs, professional advancement, or material welfare over your soul's real needs. You are human, and should delight in the joy that your humanity brings to you. You deserve no less. 6. Leave your comfort zone. You are wallowing in the present feelings and need to move out of them by physically removing yourself from whatever environment allows you to perseverate. Stop mulling in the muck and pick yourself up by moving out of your comfort zone and into an unfamiliar and challenging place. If you never climbed a mountain, do that now. If you never ran a marathon, do that now. If you abhor dating and are an inveterate introvert, go out and be with people. If you are an extrovert and always have pals around, do something solitary. Do the opposite of whatever it is you are now doing. Find new interests. Learn to throw a pot on a potter's wheel. Take an art class. Do something in the world to make it better for someone else. Go forth, my son. Give your life your all. ",

However, no two people are the same, so don't go looking for and comparing everyone else to her.  Make a decision to end your grieving process and move on. ",
