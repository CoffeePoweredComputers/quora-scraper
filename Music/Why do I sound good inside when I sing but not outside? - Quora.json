            "answer_text": "Reverb. When you are inside, the sound reflects back to you. This does two things. It helps you hear yourself better because there is more sound energy in the room, and the time delays between the initial sound and reflections add some smearing. This smearing is generally favorable for music (It depends on room dimensions and music style but for the sake of practice inside a house, it's usually fine) When you're outside, the sound energy travels out and doesn't return. There is no feedback from the room. It can feel like no matter how you try to belt, nothing is coming out loud enough. It IS coming out, it just isn't getting back to your ears. Without the room feedback, it can be harder to make corrections. There are other confounding issues. For example, the background noise is usually higher outside, so you can't hear yourself as well. And you don't have any smearing from reverb so flaws will be more obvious. ",

            "answer_text": " Hey! That's such an awesome question! Did you know that the way we hear ourselves verbally are totally different from how the outside world hears us? Try out this little experiment I got off the web! It's really cool!! All you need are two pieces of paper and that's it, okay. Next, take the two pieces of paper and hold them vertically in front of your ears and make sure they touch your face. Don't get a paper-cut! Now, all you need to do is shout, scream or even talk, just make sure your voice is loud enough that you can hear it. Next, release the paper from your ears and talk again. Did you notice that when you covered the front of your ears with paper your voice sounded different? Why does this happen? According to British science presenter, Greg Foot, you can hear your voice in two different ways. The first is by the vibrational sound waves received by your ear drums, basically how we hear other people or how they hear us. The second way is by vibrational sound waves inside the skull and this is how we hear ourselves. To sum it up, the reason why you hear yourself differently from how others perceive you is because we hear ourselves in two different ways presented to us. I hope this helped in some way. \u270c\u270c(\u0942\u2022\u1d17\u2022\u0942\u2741)  \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764 ~Love, Rosalina& Luma\u2764\u2764\u2764(\u3181\u1d17\u3181\u273f) ",
