Going back even further, to the 1950\u2019s, we have the comedy song  \u201cThe Ying Tong Song\u201d by The Goons. The goons noticed the proliferation of aphorisms, mottos and slogans in post war Britain (\u201cGo to work on an egg\u201d, \u201c a little dab\u2019ll do ya\u201d, \u201cDrinka pinta milka day\u201d and dozens of others) and decided to create a total nonsense slogan, slip it into their radio show a few times, and see if it caught on\u2026 Boy did it catch on.
