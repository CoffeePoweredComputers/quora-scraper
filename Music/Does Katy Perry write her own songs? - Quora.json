            "answer_text": "Yes and no. She has co-writing credits on almost every song she has ever released, but there are almost always co-writing credits given to other people as well. Now that she is a huge star, she has big name songwriters getting credit on a lot of what she puts out, so it is difficult to say whether she is REALLY contributing meaningfully to the songwriting.On the other hand, I get the impression that her early songs were almost entirely written by her directly.SIDE-NOTE: I\u2019m pretty sure she wrote the core of \u201cChained to the Rhythm\u201d on her own. That song and its fudged rollout have \u201cpop star with a newly awakened social conscience\u201d written all over them. ",
