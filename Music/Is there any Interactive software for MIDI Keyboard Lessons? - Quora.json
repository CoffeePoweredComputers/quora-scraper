            "answer_text": "On Mac you have Garageband interactive lessons, even offers you classical or pop tracks... great stuff.   Not so great but probably useful on PC (and iPad) you have Synthesia.   Synthesia can load almost any midi file so there are some \"piano courses\" around, like this one (I'm not endorsing it, I haven't tried it at all). Piano Lesson Package for Synthesia Or even classic methods adapted to Synthesia: Hanon and Czerny for Synthesia Users Good luck and enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "I would recommend you try Piano Marvel (www.pianomarvel.com). There is a free trial, but after that its a subscription based service. I have been using it regularly and I am now on my third yearly subscription, which use mainly for trying to improve my sight reading. However they also have a whole series of increasingly more complex lessons (60 lessons each with 20 exercises to learn and perfect). I still can\u2019t quite complete the most complex of the exercises, but my (then) 5 year old grandson could complete the simplest of ones when he was just starting out. There are accompanying videos and pdfs to help out/ ",
