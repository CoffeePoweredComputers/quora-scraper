            "answer_text": "As others have said there's lots of people online. I would steer away from up work. My opinion is based on my experience. I saw a lot of low quality providers and a lot of low quality clients. I would try sound better. That's specifically what they do and there's lots of pros there. I've been on both platforms for over a year. Here are some tips I'd like to pass on to you that will make it easier for you and your mixing engineer. Provide a reference mix. this is just something that you quickly throw together to give them an idea of what elements are important to you in the mix. Make a list of things that you don't like about your reference mix. Then make a list of things that you do like. In an ideal world the engineer would already have a relationship with you and he would know how to mix your stuff. so if you find somebody that works well I'd say stick with them rather than find a new engineer for every project. Realize that it doesn't make a difference what digital software they use. DAW. It doesn't make a difference what analog gear that they have. You are really paying for skill. When I was in a band years ago we had terrible mixes done in really nice facilities with great gear. Unfortunately the mixing engineers were usually students. Do not go super cheap. good engineers do not charge those rock bottom prices you see on up work. Anyone with a laptop can claim to be a mixing engineer. So the market is flooded with inexperienced people. And if you choose one of them you'll likely be unhappy with the work and have to find someone else to redo it. Never enough money to do it right. Always enough money to do it a second time. \ud83d\ude02 What I generally do for a client that I don't know anything about is ask them for their tracks. after that I'm in a much better position to tell them if it makes sense to spend the money mixing them. Set their expectations. And give them an accurate quote. The overwhelming majority of work I see on upwork is very poorly defined making it impossible for me to estimate cost or time or if it's even worth it. Last thing. It's hard to judge a mixing engineer's skill. Mostly because you don't know where the track started off and how much their mix improved things. For example if they mixed things from a sample library all the initial tracks sounded quite good before they even started working. And if the tracks we're done in the garage with four mics The tracks might sound like total garbage and the engineer has to work super hard to make them sound good. I've often thought it would be useful for engineers to make before and after mixes. That way you could see how much better the mix made things sound. However I've never seen anyone do it. Maybe in part because an artist doesn't want that crappy version out there. \ud83d\ude02 So you might want to look for a mixing engineer that has worked on material that was recorded in similar ways as your own. Or is familiar with your style of music. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I, for example, mix songs for people, so you'd only have to send them to me. I just finished mixing 3 albums for 3 different bands (Raw Hours, Abram Cove, and Wisefield). There are probably others who do the same thing. I have a recording studio, but the market for recording studios have gone down (at least locally where I live) now that people can record basically for free in some places, or using their own equipment. However, mixing skills/experience still has a market value. Musicians usually aren't great sound engineers.So, nowadays I simply get files sent to me and I mix them and send them back. I still record my own music in my studio, though. Generally speaking, I'm sure you could send/bring your recorded files to any recording studio. Here is an example of a song I mixed recently:https://soundcloud.com/wisefield/wisefield-mr-wolf ",
