            "answer_text": "How does it feel to be a kpop fan? This is one long ass answer and I hope you make it to the end. Good luck:) Here are the cons ans pros of being a kpop fan: PROS: Kpop teaches you to be diverse. Pretty self expanatory. Being an international fan when you come across kpop, it\u2019s not just the music you get into, but also the culture Korea offers us.You get to learn a new language. Of course, not completely or not even a part of it perhaps, but when you become a kpop fan, the first thing you do is trying to find out the meaning of a particular song. In time, you\u2019ll feel the urge to get to know the language, hangul, in depth so you can decipher the meaning of what your idol groups/ soloists say without having to ponder over the actual meaning.To be a kpop fan, you need to be open-minded. When you enter the amazing world of this craze called \u2018kpop\u2019, you have to put up with fans from all over the world. It sure will make you accept other cultures and respect them just as yours.Will teach you to love yourself, to stay healthy, to take care of yourself and to not care about others\u2019 opinions on you (if you take it in a positive sense).It kind of gives you a purpose. It gives you the purpose of stanning a particular group or soloist, to stand up for them when they are being critisized, to appreciate and enjoy the music they make, and a lot more. Being a kpop fan offers you much more than you can ever imagine.It teaches you to not only love yourself, but also the idols and artists who have worked hard, day in and day out, to make their dream come true and to achieve the fame they have. It teaches you respect every single person who stands on the stage, doing their best to entertain you and keeping up with their fans\u2019 expectations, no matter what they look like or where they come from.It teaches you to be forgiving and accepting. Idols may be seen as perfectionists, but we must remember that those people are humans do. They make mistakes to. In such cases, it the fans\u2019 duty to either inflict constructive criticism upon them, to forgive them in cases where idols are unable to realize their faults, and to stand up against the hatred that is being targetted at them.CONS: Being in a certain fandom is amazing, but the hardships it may sometimes offer are not easy to put up with. You have to go through putting up with Toxic Fans. I believe the word toxic is enough to give you an idea of how they might/can be.At times, being a kpop fans may make you question the way you look. While on the other hand it teaches you to live yourself, it also makes you feel, bluntly put, ugly. I believe almost every kpop fan has gone through this phase, even it has been for a mere second.The point stated above, often happens, due to Korean Beauty Standards. And my fellow kpop fans, you can\u2019t deny it.Being a kpop fan may either make you lose interest in interacting with people around you or vice versa (if you are lucky enough). It may be so as all you want to talk about when you get stuck into the kpop world is kpop. And people may or may not like it.It may at times make you feel depressed or atleast gloomy. My reason for saying this is, kpop has recently seen a lot of scandals, one of the most recent being, The Burning Sun scandal. When this case surfaced, and the people involved were revealed, the kpop world was taken by storm and it made headlines in not only Korea, but many other countries. It was quite saddening to see the sudden trun of events. Seungri being revealed as one if the people involved was downright disheartening. No one could have ever imagined \u2018The Great Seungri\u2019 to end up like this. And the worst part is, that people involved not only got defamed themselves, but also jeopardized the image of the respective groups (BIGBANG AND FTISLAND) they belong(ed) to.You might experience being bullied, mocked at or even hated . And it is honestly so unnerving when you experienence these things coming at you from you own family and friends. There can be nothing worse than having to listen your kpop boys/girls being ranted about for looking or speaking in a certain way. An the worst part is, that no matter how hard you try to explain your views, the others have a tendency to not listen.You may be involved in fanwars. But honestly, who among the ones that stans the BIG 3 or other famous groups doesn\u2019t go through this?It may be a distraction to your studies/ work. You know thay creepy moment when you\u2019re not even thinking about kpop (whuch in itself is very difficult) and a song starts playing in your head out of nowhere. Kpop fans, you definitely know this feeling!You may be possessive of your idols sometimes. Okay let\u2019s admit it, IT HAPPENS.This is my way of observing things and explaing my perspective. It\u2019s upto you how to feel as a kpop fan, since there are both, the positive and negative sides to it. ALWAYS REMEMBER, NEVER FORGET TO SPREAD LOVE AND RESPECT, IF NOT LIKE OR SUPPORT, EVERY SINGLE IDOL. ",

            "answer_text": "Very refreshing if one is a listener of K-pop music rather than a fan of a single group or having biased idols. More than a year into K-pop, both group songs as well as solos with music videos and with no mv songs, I felt they are quenching my thirst for a different kind of music and instrumentals every now and then. I strongly say that I look forward to hearing more master pieces from them. ",
