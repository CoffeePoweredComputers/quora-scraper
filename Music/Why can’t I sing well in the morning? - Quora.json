            "answer_text": "Your vocal cords lack elasticity in the morning due to tensions developed in the surrounding muscles (especially those within the shoulders, neck,and jaw), and our bodies also tend to naturally develop more mucus in the morning that causes our voices to not function as well as we want them to. As a result, most of us tend to not sing well after we just woke up, and that is totally fine - it is normal. At the end of the day, just like football players who are more prone to injuries or not able to play well without warm-ups, we will not be at our best physically when our muscles are not fully toned for much more vigorous performances, so just keep warming up those muscles safely (do not force your voice to sing high notes till your cords are more elastic) until you are comfortable singing without any unnecessary strain. Do not forget to drink a cup of hot tea or a glass of warm water too in order to keep your vocal cords soothed, relaxed and hydrated. ",

            "answer_text": "Our bodies naturally have more gunk and mucus in the morning, and it can interfere with singing ability. If you ever have a singing gig in the morning (I've had plenty and it's always a challenge), make sure to get up many hours before, drink hot tea, blow your nose often, clear your throat, and practice singing exercises all morning and on the way to the gig in your car. I don't think my voice ever sounds as great in the morning EVER, but you just work with what you have and make the best of it. I'd much rather prefer singing at night. ",
