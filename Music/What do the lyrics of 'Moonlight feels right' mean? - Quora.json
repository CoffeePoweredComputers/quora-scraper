            "answer_text": "Well, according to songwriter, and man behind Starbuck's keyboard, Bruce Blackman:  \"My inspiration for writing the song came from a beautiful girl from Greenville, Mississippi. I was playing poker in a dorm room at Delta State and noticed a newspaper photo hanging on the wall of young women in a beauty pageant. One of the girls was so beautiful I didn\u2019t even believe it could be possible.  I found out what college she was attending and I registered there for the sole purpose of trying to meet her. I did meet her and asked her out 3 times. The third time she accepted and that\u2019s when 'the wind blew some luck in my direction'.\" You can read the whole story of the song here: David Carroll's Chattanooga Radio and TV. ",

He sounds like he's from Baltimore and he met a True southern girl, who graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1974, and, he too is a Southerner, but a wee bit more \u201chip\u201d and he wants to show her a good time. Maybe he's sadly talking codes about drugs, with Drop the Top, but it's a cute tune. I graduated from the University of Mississippi. Live Ol'Miss ",
