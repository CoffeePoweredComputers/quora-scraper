            "answer_text": "The State of Georgia has officially adopted the Stars and Bars, an original flag of the Confederate States of America. Here are the Confederacy\u2019s official Stars and Bars, in four variations (the design changed as more states seceded):   This is the Georgia State Flag that I remember while growing up, from 1956\u20132001. It prominently features the Battle Guidon of the Army of Northern Virginia (Gen. Robert E. Lee\u2019s army division), which is often (incorrectly) called the \u201cConfederate Flag\u201d and is sometimes mistaken for the \u201cStars and Bars\u201d  Georgia state flag, 1956\u20132001  Since the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia was deemed too controversial, Georgia changed it \u2014- to an ACTUAL flag of the Confederate States of America (CSA), the Stars and Bars (1861\u20131863 version with 13 stars), which Georgia has personalized by simply adding the Georgia State Seal:  Flag of the State of Georgia (2003-present)  Changing this design was considered a Civil Rights victory by people who don\u2019t know very much about flags. Pro-confederacy folks were quietly laughing their asses off; the personalized Stars and Bars now hangs proudly in the Georgia State Capitol Building and adorns schools and other public buildings. Many people seem completely unaware. Funny how things work out sometimes.  Here is former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter sitting at his desk with the Battle Flag of Northern Virginia over his left shoulder:  Here is the current Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, sitting at the same desk, but with the personalized Stars and Bars over his left shoulder (at least they got rid of the awful pink wallpaper):  Flags of the Confederate States of America - WikipediaFlag of Georgia (U.S. state) - Wikipedia FWIW, for about two years between these two Georgia flags, the state adopted this vexillological monstrosity:  Georgia State flag (2001\u20132003) ",

They were sending a message to civil rights activists in the 60s: We are waging a war. Come here and we will kill you. Today, the knuckle-dragging mouth-breathers who spout inanities like \u201cHeritage, Not Hate\u201d don\u2019t know their heritage. Or their history. You tell these Y\u2019all Quaeda yahoos that the (Edit) Southern Cross weren\u2019t the flag of the Confederacy and they\u2019ll say \u201cNuh-uh! It was too, moran!
