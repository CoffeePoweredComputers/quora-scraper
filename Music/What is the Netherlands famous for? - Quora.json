            "answer_text": "[This is a list off the top of my head. Some things I like to hope we are known for.] Nederland, The Netherlands:17 million citizens on a small patch of land. A good 3 Hours drive from top to bottom. It also sorta looks like a toddlers rendition of a little man.  The obvious: Clogs:1 Klomp, 2 Klompen  Windmills:1 Windmolen, 2 Windmolens  Stroopwafels:1 Stroopwafel, 2 Stroopwafels  Bicycles:1 Fiets, 2 Fietsen  Thatched roofs:1 Rieten dak, 2 Rieten daken:  Now that\u2019s out of the way; The not so obvious: Police:1 Motormuis, 2 Motormuizen:  (Social) Safety:  Often overlooked by us Dutch folk, cause it is never seen. Fairly often taken for granted, only felt when it is not there. This is probably one of the safest places on earth. With easy access to physical and mental healthcare. And a social safety net for when \u2018life\u2019 happens. Which supports you after losing your job and/or income, be it due to a reorganizing in the workplace or (mental) illness. They\u2019re also there if you have difficulties in other areas of daily life like cleaning the house, taking care of yourself, or taking care of the rules. The countless, never ending rules. Which is a great segue to my next point. Bureaucracy:\u2018Muggenziften\u2019 \u2018Mierenneuken\u2019 - Nitpicking, Splitting hairs (loosely translated)  We like to keep track of things. Lots and lots of things. We like rules. Lots and lots of little tiny little rules (\u2018regeltjes\u2019).I like to reason it comes with the territory of the social safety net and people\u2019s efforts to abuse it, but it\u2019s likely far more complicated than that. It can be quite a maze to get things done over here. And it can be quite a wait too. Only to hear that your application has taken a detour at some department or other. Oh wait, it was just at the bottom of this pile. \u201cAh, yes I\u2019m gonna need more information from you. If you can please fill out and send me these forms. Then we can start the application process. This can take up to 13 weeks.\u201d Lifting and Moving big things:1 Mammoet, 2 Mammoeten(?)   How to take land from, and NOT slide back into, the sea:Remember, large portions of our country lies beneath sea level. Afsluitdijk  StormvloedkeringThose 2 white arms MOVE, to lock down one of the most important harbors into and out of Europe, in the event of a storm.  We do Flowers: \u201c [in 2013] The Netherlands still exports more than half of all the cut flowers globally \u201d[1] Bloemenveiling Aalsmeer  - Lots and lots of flowers: Bloemencorso - These are all made with friggin flowers. We do this every year. It\u2019s a huge event, with countless of these cars/floats(?). It\u2019s nuts.    Safety (continued) - Wildlife and nature in generalBig scary wolf:  Last year we had a wolf take a stroll around the \u201cDrenthse\u201d country-side for a few weeks. Which gave everybody a big scare:\u201cA wild animal on our lands?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a danger to our cows and kids.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a menace to our traffic. It distresses drivers by walking next to the road. It makes drivers rubberneck, and causes accidents (on the \u2018dodenweg\u2019).\u201d After a while it was shot and killed to prevent it from \u2018becoming a problem\u2019 basically. It got a statue though,:  - It\u2019s near a parking space. I drive by it sometimes. Now we\u2019ve spotted a pack of wolves near our border. The first in many years. Farmers are up in arms. Mothers fear for their children. Apart from that we don\u2019t have scary wildlife around here. No huge spiders, ants or giant centipedes. Nor bears, tigers or hippos. No, we\u2026.. We fear ticks:  - And maybe the neighbors untrained / mistreated pet dog. The harshest of weather:  - Ankle high water in a valley. \u2018Drouwen\u2019 We get the occasional (yearly) local floods in some choice areas. And on the rare occasion a \u2018small scale\u2019 tornado graces us with it\u2019s presence. Next to that, we have: the mandatory Yearly Heat Wave.Oh, and of course the autumn storms.And the week or 2 of \u2018sudden\u2019 frost (no one ever sees coming) where people become even bigger dangers to themselves.But no one really cares. We just bitch-and-moan a lot. For that is about all that nature throws at us. ===== Oh, we had a lenient policy on soft-drugs too before it was the cool thing to do, so we are hipsters in that too I guess. ===== Edit; Wow, This actually got upvotes and views. Thanks for reading my ramblings. Also Thanks for the input. I indeed forgot how Huge flowers are for us. Also added the \u2018dangerous\u2019 local wildlife.

            "answer_text": "When you say famous things I think of two different things: Something Holland is known for (e.g. Famous Dutch people, famous traditions, famous brands, etc.) or some famous places in Holland. First I will start of with stating what Holland is. Holland is not the same as the country the Netherlands, which consists of more than just the two provinces of Holland (Noord- and Zuid-Holland). While Holland is the two provinces with the highest population, you can not just say Holland when you mean the Netherlands. I assume you meant the whole country the Netherlands when you said Holland, so I will answer this keeping that in mind. Some famous people from the Netherlands: Rembrandt van Rijn - Rembrandt Vincent van Gogh - Vincent van Gogh Antonie van Leeuwenhoek - Antonie van Leeuwenhoek Christiaan Huygens - Christiaan Huygens Hendrik Lorentz - Hendrik Lorentz Desiderius Erasmus - Erasmus Martin Garrix - Martin Garrix Armin van Buuren -Armin van Buuren Arjen Robben - Arjen Robben Johan Cruyff - Johan Cruyff Mata Hari - Mata Hari Some famous traditions: Sinterklaas - Sinterklaas Oliebollen - Oliebol Koningsdag - Koningsdag  Elfstedentocht - Elfstedentocht  Some famous Dutch brands: Shell - Royal Dutch Shell Heineken - Heineken Philips - Philips Other things the Netherlands is famous for: Liberal stand towards a lot of subjects (E.g. Weed, prostitution, LGBT) Tulips Cloggies (wooden shoes) Dutch cheese (Gouda, Edammer) Windmills Bicycles Well that were the famous Dutch things\u2026 Now some famous Dutch places: Amsterdam - AmsterdamWith a lot of the most famous museums, the \u2018grachten\u2019, the red light district and many more this is definitely the most famous place in the Netherlands.  Keukenhof - KeukenhofAfter Amsterdam this is probably the place where you will find the most tourists, this is often seen as \u201cthe most Dutch thing ever\u201d (it is not).  Giethoorn - GiethoornOften said to be \u201cThe Venetia of the north\u201d, in the summer there are more tourists than inhabitants in this place.  De afsluitdijk - AfsluitdijkOne of the most famous Dutch waterworks, this dyke successfully transformed the southern sea (de Zuiderzee) into the IJssellake (het IJsselmeer).  There is obviously a lot more than this. I will add more later and if you have suggestions, put them in the comments. All images are from Google and Wikipedia. ",
