            "answer_text": "There are many different composers of \u201catonal music\u201d. Take the Second Viennese School, led by Arnold Schoenberg with his pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern. Each of these composers wrote atonal music, but they are different from one another in major ways. And later, Elliott Carter is different from Milton Babbitt is different from Roger Sessions is different from Karlheinz Stockhausen. Each has admirers, each has detractors. Some find Carter\u2019s atonality inspired and intriguing, others find it cold and mechanical. Some like the lyricism of Berg (example: Lyric Suite), as opposed to the abstraction of Webern (example: Variations for Piano) or the pounding rhythms and sharp discords of Schoenberg (example: 4th string quartet, Serenade). In my opinion, what appeals to open-minded listeners can be the challenge to the ear of atonal music, even an enjoyment of its freedom from tonal strictures. But atonality can be *shaped* in an infinite number of ways. People are still writing atonal music in new ways. But, to put a different spin on it, I\u2019ve just mentioned 20th century classical composers. The late musicologist Edward E. Lowinsky felt the presence of atonality in the late-16th/early 17th century composer, Carlo Gesualdo, whose intense chromaticism left the listener somewhat lost. Some music of Orlando di Lasso is like Gesualdo, his Prophetiae Sybillarum has s unprepared harmonies and modulations that are in a sense \u201catonal\u201d, i.e. without a specific \u201ctonal\u201d orientation. It all depends upon what you mean by, or how you define, \u201catonality\u201d. In the 19th century, Franz Liszt experimented with atonality. For example, his \u201cPrelude sans tonalite\u201d or \u201cprelude without tonality\u201d has some tonal features but avoids tonal cadences and is in a sense atonal. It\u2019s an interesting question you raise. ",

            "answer_text": "Since almost the very beginning of my introduction to classical music (A few years ago, though it practically consumes my life now), I have been aware of atonal composers and few of their works. Studying composition myself, I have always been told by teachers and professors that Atonal music or near atonal music (sorry I don't have a better term for this genre) is the only way to push forward with music. I have made an effort on a few occasions to really listen to atonal music and witness the superior range of expression contemporary composers claim it has. In general, I find most of what I listened to is just kind of terrifying and sometimes annoying. For instance, in Nono's piano concerto, I was either finding humor in how random some moments were, or being terrified by the sounds I was hearing. There is such a focus on this genre of music with musicians and composers now that I just don't understand. Classical music is dying, and composers are writing this. I understand that composers are always supposed to push the limits and find their own voice in their writing, but if that Sciarrino piece represents the new voice of music, who will want to listen to it? It's true that good music should stimulate and challenge its audience, but how challenging should it be to enjoy an artist's expression? In all of the different phases and evolutions of classical music, ours is certainly the age of challenged listeners. I could write more, but I don't want to drag this out into a huge essay. I guess my questions to those that enjoy (and perhaps also compose!) atonal music would be: Have you ever heard an atonal work that expressed joy, or another emotion other than sorrow or violence, that you could relate to? Do you feel strongly enough about the music to suggest that a friend should listen to it? What is the point of writing without tonality? ",
