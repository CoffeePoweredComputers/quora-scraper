            "answer_text": "Wendy. Ros\u00e8 have something in common with Park Bom: their company wants their vocal to be unique by forcing a certain technique that put some strain to their vocal cord. In the long term, it will reduce their ability to sing. Park Bom was a decent vocalist, but after a few years with 2NE1, her voice became cracked, her range reduced, and she can't maintain long belts anymore. I'm afraid Ros\u00e8 will suffer the same fate. ",
