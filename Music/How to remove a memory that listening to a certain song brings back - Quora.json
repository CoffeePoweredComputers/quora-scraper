            "answer_text": "Firstly, let us address why you remember that specific memory when listening to a specific song. Our brains remember things best in pairs, hence we call that memory by association. For example, if you were to try to remember your grocery list, try pairing each item on your list and remember each pair, you will find that you would be better able to recall the items on your grocery list. In the same way, when we think of/see someone or something as we are listening to music, our minds will associate what we think/see to that song via association. However, unlike the grocery example, you will find that the link between music and the memory is much stronger, especially if you were to repeat the song and memory together. In a 2009 study from the University of California, titled, \u2018The Neural Architecture of Music-Evoked Autobiographical Memories\u2019, the brains of people were mapped while they were listening to music. It was found the specific brain regions linked to autobiographical memories and emotions are activated by familiar music. As such, the study shows that association forms between music and memories, especially the emotions of the memories. Now to answer your question directly, there are a few ways remove the link between the memory and song. Rewriting, rewiring - take that specific song and listen to it while you do something else (works better if you do something new/something you normally wouldn't do often). Ensure that the new activity is not monotonous and requires you to focus on it thereby preventing you from relapsing back to the old memory. The science behind this would be that in 2012, scientists at the University of Cambridge showed for the first time that a person can suppress a memory, or force it out of awareness, by using a part of the brain, known as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, to inhibit activity in the hippocampus. The hippocampus plays a key role in remembering events. To substitute a memory, people can redirect their consciousness towards an alternative memory. They can do this by using two regions called the caudal prefrontal cortex and the mid ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These areas are important for bringing specific memories into the conscious mind, in the presence of distracting memories.The little things - a way to forget a memory is to blot out the context. Context can be anything, including sense-related cues, such as taste and smell. With less context remembered, this weakens our ability to recall specific memories.Throw out the emotions - as shown in the study above, we mainly remember the emotions connected to a memory when we hear a song. By numbing the emotions, eventually the memory loses it\u2019s grip and it\u2019s impact, thereby allowing it to be forgotten. As for how to numb the emotion, it really depends on the emotion itself.For example, to numb fear and grief, the best way is to face the memory. By continuously facing the memory which causes fear and grief, the memory goes through reconsolidation, which means that the memory changes over time, and eventually fear and grief is numbed. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Why would you want to forget something that is a source for growth and healing? Everything bad that happens to us is a goldmine for growth, change and healing. You should share with us the circumstances. I'm sure the song also contains good memories. Why would you want to forget those? I have lost many friends whom I associate songs with. Those songs are blessings because they help me remember them. Henri Nouwen once said \u201cBlessed are those who suffer, not because suffering is good, but because they shall be comforted.\u201d Suffering helps survivors to be more human, more humane. After every natural diaster, sure, it is bad because people die and suffer but, millions donate time and money to save lives. That is pain and suffering in action for good. If you speed and get a ticket, you may drive slower which ultimately could save your life. Touch a hot pot and you won\u2019t do it again. Gossip and get called out for it, you may never gossip again. If it hurts to move your arm, you don\u2019t move it. If a lover dumps you, it makes you appreciate the next one all the more. Pain is a great teacher whether it is emotional or physical. A friend of mine lost her son to HIV/AIDS. They were a good Roman Catholic family and abandoned him when he first came out. After he died, mom FINALLY came around and she founded a support group for families with LGBT kids. She became a lobbyist for LBGT rights. She left her church who thought her son was sinful. She has proudly been arrested four times for protesting. She has changed and saved many lives BECAUSE OF HER PAIN. She will never forget her own pain because it is what drives her to change the world and save others. I watched the Lawrence Nassar sentencing on the news yesterday and was disappointing that he didn\u2019t turn around to his victims and ask them to forgive him. He merely apologized which is sort of meaningless. Many of his victims, I\u2019m sure would not forgive him and go on in life hating and being perpetual victims. The few girls who would forgive him, they would heal, become healers and move on with life as survivors. Pain can kill us if we ignore or fight it. It can save us if we embrace it and use it for growth. When I answered a suicide hotline, I asked all the volunteers why they were there. Some were there because they had a loved one complete suicide. Some were once suicidal themselves. Embracing pain can lead to healing, saving and greatness. . . . uhm, others were there hoping to be offered a job, were getting credit for school, thought it would look good on a resum\u00e9, or were court ordered to do volunteer work. Guess which class of volunteer did a superior job and, were sometimes offered jobs? ",

Joy and happiness have no meaning if there is never pain and suffering. I have songs that I listen to because they bring back painful memories. For me, it's good to remember that sadness, that hopelessness, because I have persevered to find happiness and meaning in life. But it's entirely possible that I would've never made it here, much less appreciate what I have quite the same, if I hadn't gone through those experiences. ",
