            "answer_text": "Neither of these two answers are correct. UMG is a music group, like Warner Music Group (WMG) and Sony Music. These \"groups\" own a myriad of music assets including record labels, publishing companies and distribution companies (as well as minority interests in music related businesses like Spotify, Soundcloud, etc.) Universal Music Group owns record labels (like Island, DefJam, Universal, Republic, Motown, Lost Highway, etc.) Those labels often have \"sub-labels\" like GOOD Music which is a record label, of course, but sometimes referred to as an \"imprint,\" if it is in a junior position to another, more established parent label. The question of master ownership is completely variable based on many circumstances and negotiations. Some imprints are strictly vanity \"labels\" (often referred to as a \"logo deal,\" wherein a performer or producer is really signed to the major label but because of a certain level of clout (creative or sales based) gets a few extra points on their releases and gets to have their \u201clabel\u201d logo on the record.) Other labels can be 100% owned by an artist or entrepreneur but distributed by the larger music \"group\" for a period of time. Island, Geffen and A&M Records were all independently owned before they got bought by PolyGram and MCA, which then got merged into Universal creating the basis of the Universal Music Group. Island and DefJam were obviously separate labels as independents but were merged by UMG to facilitate combining backend resources as well as things like promotion and marketing under one umbrella. A logo alone is not enough to tell the full story. Industry experience or a conversation with an experienced music lawyer can help determine who owns what, but more often than not, the entity that paid for the recording is the true owner, despite what the logo says.

            "answer_text": "UMG is a major label.  Good Music is an imprint label connected to UMG. Good Music is responsible for securing licensing and paying out royalties.  UMG will distribute the product and help with promotion of the releases. Artists create their own labels in an attempt to own master recordings to be used later in other works of control rights if the recording is sampled since that is the new theme in music. So, it's a joint venture agreement between boutique labels and major labels. I hope this is helpful! ",
