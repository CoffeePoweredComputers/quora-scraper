            "answer_text": "Certainly they can. With some limits. American Sign Language (ASL) and most other sign languages do not have a written form, so deaf people who primarily communicate through sign are writing in a second language. How well can you write in the Spanish you learned in high school? Because of the way we teach reading, deaf people are substantially disadvantaged. Most of our reading is based on matching letters to sounds, which makes no sense to a deaf person. So, the average reading level among the deaf community is about 5th grade level. Writing tends to be a simpler version of what we can read, so deaf people will tend to write at 5th grade level or below. This has nothing to do with cognitive limitations from being deaf. It\u2019s because we teach reading and writing in ways that disadvantage those who can\u2019t hear. ",
