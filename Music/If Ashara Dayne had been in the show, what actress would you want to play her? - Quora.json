The other thing is Ashara\u2019s purple eyes, if they\u2019re not going to make the actors wear contacts, then maybe,either - Actress , Alexis Bledel ,  Or actress,Grace Phipps.  Nina Dobrev with contacts?  I imagine that Ashara would have been shown in flashbacks, like Rhaegar, she was young during those events. I can\u2019t imagine the show getting into Ashara faking her death and being alive now, since they barely mention her at all. ",

She was known for being tall with dark hair and violet eyes and since she was from the Dornish region, I would imagine she had a darker or olive skin tone, similar to the Martells. So the person that pops into my mind when I think of Ashara Dayne would be Adriana Lima    Adriana Lima is probably what I imagined a young Ashara Dayne would look like, if I had to guess. PS. Adriana Lima is model but she has also acted in several films too, making her an actress.. = 0 ",
