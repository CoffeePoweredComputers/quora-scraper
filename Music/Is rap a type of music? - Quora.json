            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes. This is not up for debate. Longer answer: a lack of traditional instruments in one of the six categories (brass, woodwind, bowed string, keyboard, percussion, guitar) or a lack of semitonic vocal performances does not mean rap/hip-hop music lacks instrumentalists, melody, or harmony. As I\u2019ve answered before on Quora, rapping\u2014the rhythmic speech-based style of vocal performance\u2014in and of itself is full of melody. Not only is the human speaking voice inherently melodic, but rappers hit very intentional and effective patterns of notes. Here is my expanded explanation of how richly melodic rapping itself is, incorporating Ethan Hein\u2019s research of a capella vocal tracks from famous rappers[1]\u2014never mind the instrumentation, sampling, and singing that is also found in hip-hop. This answer of mine also takes down the \u201cThree Element\u201d argument against hip-hop as a genre of music (SPOILER: a form of music doesn\u2019t need all the magical elements of rhythm, melody, and harmony to be considered a genre). There is also plenty of harmony\u2014pleasing combinations of notes and chords\u2014in hip-hop. I truly don\u2019t know where the notion that rap music has no harmony comes from. Listen to any Kid Cudi[2], Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (apt), or A Tribe Called Quest and see the mental gymnastics it takes to deny the presence of harmony. If you want to look at more traditional rap performances that don\u2019t blur the line between rapping and singing, you still get a catalog full of intentional artists talented enough to make their flows percussive and melodic, often strategically delivering certain syllables to change the mood of a lyric or artistically transition into the next line. Andre 3000\u2019s opening verse on \u201cInt\u2019l Players Anthem\u201d with UGK leapt to the front of my mind as an example for you to observe how musical a rap performance can be. So, here\u2019s a wonderful gift for making it to the end of this answer.  Note: Andre 3K is not either of the two gentlemen (Pimp C and Bun B) pictured above Footnotes[1] Zander Tsadwa's answer to Is Ben Shapiro right about hip-hop not being music?[2] Kid Cudi- Man On The Moon",

            "answer_text": "Our own upbringing and feelings have a lot to do with what is considered music. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t country, it ain\u2019t music\u201d, goes the saying, along with its corollary: \u201cIf it ain\u2019t Bach, it ain\u2019t muzik.\u201d The ancient Greeks considered music as encompassing drama, song and poetry. The Bible has 150 \u201cPsalms\u201d right in the middle pages, every one of them considered to be a song, but not a single note anywhere; and their rhythms are originally Hebrew and don\u2019t translate into English rhythms that well - but we still consider them music. Rap features strong, dynamic rhythm, as does its cousin hip-hop (much of which is rap with a musical background). It also may feature rhyming poetry, highly inflected speech and other concepts we associate with music. However, it\u2019s a lot easier to just say \u201crap\u201d, and sidestep the strict definitions. ",
