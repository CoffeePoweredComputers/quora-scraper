            "answer_text": "I can see why someone might name the biggest names, but I disagree because I\u2019m adding their influence into the equation. Still, even considering that, my answer is easy. It\u2019s not even close. I am amazed that no one in 25 answers so far that I can see has mentioned Taylor Swift. Maybe it\u2019s just because we\u2019re seeing the others in hindsight, but even then, what about the hype machines of the past ten to twenty years? Still, the Beatles, the Stones, Queen, Nirvana\u2026 even if you think they are overrated, how are they the most overrated? They each had a lot going for them. Taylor Swift, however, has nothing. Absolutely nothing. She could record herself farting into a microphone for 30 minutes and sell it as a platinum EP, but she cannot sing to save her life. I mean it. She can\u2019t carry a tune and she sounds like she\u2019s torturing a cat, and that\u2019s with enough autotune to overdose the Gregory Brothers. I can\u2019t imagine what kind of depressed, drunken hyena she actually sounds like without a million dollars worth of studio magic. Her songs are beyond vapid and stupid, even for bubblegum pop. I\u2019ve literally heard parodies of the genre that sounded better. Several of them, like that one in the middle of Jessica Jones season 2. Even if you\u2019re hung up on the physical appearance of singers, Taylor Swift is downright ugly. She looks like a malnourished twelve-year-old boy in mediocre drag. Not that this should matter so much, but when her supposed beauty is part of the hype I will admit that it is irritating. The only extraordinary thing about Taylor Swift is the size of the budget that goes into making her look like the biggest thing in the world of music when there\u2019s really nothing there. She is easily the most overrated musician in my lifetime. ",

            "answer_text": "The number one spot goes to\u2026 Nirvana. Kurt Cobain was a gifted songwriter. His tragic story is definitely one of the saddest in music history. But when I see them being given titles like \u201c The voice of a generation\u201d , I tend to let a snicker or two out. Sure, they made some catchy tunes. But none of their songs are worthy of being put on a \u201c Greatest tunes of the 90\u2019s.\u201d playlist. Such a playlist would be filled with bands that stuck around longer and diversified their sound. Plus, their songs are kind of formulaic. That\u2019s not bad per se, it just gets kind of boring after a while. Spot #2 goes to\u2026 Queen You might be thinking I\u2019m being hypocritical with this one. Yes, Queen was diverse.Yes, Queen did stick around for a while. You aren\u2019t wrong. But personally, they\u2019ve never really resonated with me. \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 gets on my nerves. Spot #3 goes to\u2026. The Stones This ones kind of difficult for me, mainly because I absolutely adore some of their stuff. \u2018Let it Bleed\u2019 might be a top 10 album for me. \u2018Sticky Fingers\u2019 is a classic. They\u2019re not the GOAT, contrary to what they claim. Many of their songs are instantly forgettable. Honorable Mentions: AC/DC Bob Dylan Coldplay( talk about bland and lifeless\u2026) Almost every modern pop band ",
