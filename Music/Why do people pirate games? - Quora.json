            "answer_text": "In the most fundamental sense it\u2019s because they can. However they justify it can vary, as with some people who lean more towards defending, supporting and advocating piracy and claiming that it\u2019s a progressive form of justice against capitalism, greedy business practices, and transcend it by claiming it\u2019s revolutionising the internet, with others in between who have a certain level of asceticism and moral integrity to uphold and justify pirating only situationally ( game testing, saving up to afford it, not available in their countries, etc ) because it has a certain level of bad and good effects on the gaming industry, and then those who completely oppose pirating and consider it an immoral and selfish act that ruins the gaming industry and squanders the developer\u2019s efforts. Truth be told, there are points to be taken from all sides of this spectrum but in my opinion none of them really matter on a big enough scale that is able to transcend any of their arguments and points, because pirating is simply one of those exceptional illegal phenomenas that has taken root in of and exploited the fundamental loopholes and the early vulnerable state of the foundation of a system ( two words : FILE SHARING ) that in the same vein allows for other legal practices to continue capitalising from, while pirating takes advantage of the leverage it has through corruption, expanding it\u2019s reach into other industries ( in this case ANY form of media that the internet distributes ) and augmenting more loopholes after becoming such an established and pervasive industry and network of it\u2019s own, ultimately muddying the waters, blurring the lines and poisoning the well altogether, and should anyone decide to enforce generalised laws and legal implications it would cause utter chaos and a huge shitstorm of lawsuits, coalitions, conflict, uproars, internecine, etc, from all sides of the internet [1]and even beyond it in some ways. ( think a bunch of industries and countries like this[2][3] that have circumvented so many restricting policies and can only rely on pirating for any source of media ) If you see my point, I\u2019m comparing pirating to the class of epidemics that isn\u2019t shy of the conundrum on the war on drugs, gun laws, political corruption, wealth inequality, etc, especially if piracy is something that has manifested itself into literally every single form of media distribution and file sharing online AKA the platform and landscape of our new day and age, which would in many ways many cause catastrophe on every front if it were truly to be implicated.

            "answer_text": "Assuming they have access to the game (And it\u2019s not region locked) Because they don\u2019t want to pay for it? Yeah, I\u2019ve heard every rationale for \u201cpirating games\u201d and it always comes down to one thing. Pirates want a game but are not willing (or able) to pay for it. The worst rationale is the \u201cTry before I buy\u201d. So basically people think they deserve the right to try out a game before buying it? This is usually stated because \u201cgames don\u2019t have demos\u201d. And there\u2019s truth in that. But if a game doesn\u2019t have a demo, and it\u2019s a console game, there\u2019s still rental systems including gamefly, and redbox, hundreds of reviews, and millions of players reactions. If it\u2019s a PC game you can usually get it on Steam, and they give you two hours no questions asked refunds\u2026 so you still can try it. What they want is to play the game for free with no inconvenience.. and then they\u2019ll buy \u201cif it meets their opinion of what\u2019s worth the money.\u201d Do you see how that doesn\u2019t really rationalize anything? They have the data, information, ability to try the game legally in many ways, they have the ability to try before they buy\u2026 but they still pirate it. Piracy is rather simple, people want to play without paying and while they\u2019ll dress it up with rather good sounding reasons, the real reason is because they\u2019re cheap and don\u2019t respect the people who spent the time to make the game, or the company that published (And paid those people to work on the game) .
