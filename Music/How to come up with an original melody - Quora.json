            "answer_text": "There are as many ways to create melodies as there are songwriters, but there\u2019s a particular method sometimes called \u201ctrack and hook\u201d that works well for beginners, and I recommend it. The track and hook method is common in contemporary pop songwriting. Here\u2019s how it works. First, you need a complete instrumental track. It doesn\u2019t need to be original; any pop or hip-hop instrumental will work fine. You can also use the loop libraries that come with programs like Logic, FL Studio, or Ableton Live to easily make your own instrumentals. Next, you\u2019ll need some way to record your voice. Your phone is adequate for this purpose, but it\u2019s more fun and productive to record with a decent-sounding mic. Put your instrumental on, press record, close your eyes, and scat-sing some nonsense. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything profound. In their delightful pop songwriting guide, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty suggest the chorus to \u201cThat\u2019s The Way (I Like It)\u201d by KC and the Sunshine Band.  Whatever you\u2019re singing, play with it. Let it evolve. Don\u2019t be afraid to be silly. A lot of the greatest songs ever written started as improvised nonsense. When Paul McCartney was writing \u201cYesterday,\u201d he conceived the opening line using the words \u201cScrambled eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs.\u201d You\u2019re concerned with the sound of the words, not their meaning. This is why it\u2019s important to record yourself doing this: you might stumble on something good, very quickly. You\u2019d be surprised how easy it is to come up with a catchy phrase just by goofing around. Actually, if you know any little kids, you won\u2019t be surprised. Kids improvise melodies all the time, and they can be maddeningly catchy. If (when) you get something good, you want to make sure it\u2019s captured so you can remember it. Once you\u2019ve got a bunch of good-sounding nonsense phrases, you\u2019re on your way. Repeat them, vary them, string them together. When you have a complete melody you\u2019re satisfied with, then start replacing your nonsense syllables with English. Or don\u2019t! There are plenty of great songs that make little or no sense on the page. If you have a lyric you like that doesn\u2019t fit your melody, change the lyric. If something just can\u2019t be resolved or fixed, don\u2019t make yourself crazy. Put your instrumental back on and do some more scat singing. Writing melodies is easy. Writing good melodies is hard. But the way you get there is through a lot of playful experimentation. You should expect your first hundred or so tunes to be pretty bad. That\u2019s okay. Get them out, work them through, record them, and move on. Like everything, you get better at songwriting with practice. ",

            "answer_text": "So I\u2019m not particularly helpful. I tend to improvise recicativo, and then work my notes into a normal cadence, and repeat a phrase. My melodies come from sweat and blood. I either noodle on my keyboard, or write things while zoning out during calculus, after binning enough garbage, eventually I have a melody I\u2019m happy with. I personally don\u2019t like to start with chords because I think we hear first and foremost the melody and I don\u2019t want to make it any harder to write something beautiful, however there are great arguments for both. I would say that if you are planning on using simple chords, don\u2019t write harmony first, but if you have a complex harmonic idea, then you can try starting with harmony. Fitting a melody in I VI V7 I isn\u2019t very useful inspiration, but if you have something crazy like the changes in giant steps, to this day the song is know for the harmony. It is very different for everyone. Beethoven had to do more or less what Im doing. Write. Bin, rewrite, until happy. Mozart and bach were both known for churning out melodies like as though they were divinely inspired. Unless you are working jazz though, I think you should just write something until happy. I usually pick a rhythm first because I think rhythm changes the emotional aesthetic almost as much as tonality. Good luck. Sorry for the slow response on the A2A. ",
