            "answer_text": "If I told you 2 weeks would you pursue it? If I told you 5 years, 10 years, a lifetime, would you just quit now? As a music teacher, I hear this all the time, usually as someone is finding out about how to sign up - \u201cHow long will it take me to learn a song?\u201d \u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t care if you have the best teacher in the universe. That answer is up to you. These questions really tell me that you don\u2019t want it that bad (which is fine, maybe you don\u2019t, and you\u2019re just curious) - unless we give you some sort of short, easy timeline, you\u2019re likely not to pursue the goal. The fact that you\u2019re asking tells me you mostly know this is not the case, it takes some people many many years to learn to compose AND produce, and some never really achieve this. There\u2019s no one answer. Again, that all depends on you. Are you a fast learner? Will you actually practice consistently? I try to practice 2+ hours a day, and that\u2019s still not enough. I have a student who\u2019s practiced very diligently for 2 years and he\u2019s starting to put together basic compositions (chord progressions really) on the piano. I have another, for 2 years, who never practices. Ever. They blow off the occasional class. They claim they practice. But the fact that the student still doesn\u2019t remember how to build a major scale, or the fact they\u2019ve learned maybe 2 complete songs from the first 10 pages of a beginner-curriculum book, shows they don\u2019t practice (not how they should, at least). So it\u2019s all up to you. If you have no job and expendable income, nothing to do all day or be responsible for, and you have an average intellect, and the desire (see how these questions aren\u2019t good questions? So many variables), and the equipment, then in my head, it shouldn\u2019t take you more than 6 months to at least understand the concepts at work here, if not, be able to crank out a few novice compositions. I started trying to \u201ccompose,\u201d at 8. The compositions mostly sounded like an 8 year old made them. However, I received a college performance cert for piano, in 5th grade, so I\u2019d like to think it was a little more intellectual - not really, basically fast reggae with a video-game-like melody. But I\u2019ve been doing it since then (30 now), and everything sounds much nicer (I\u2019m still no John Williams or Quincy Jones). One of my best friends is, in my opinion, a much better songwriter than I am. Yet I\u2019ve written easily over 40\u201350+ tunes and songs in the last 10 years, he has a similar (if anything, more relaxed) lifestyle than I do, and he might make 1 a year. His songs are good, but not getting better. You write one song a year, not much traction. Write 50+, sure, some are bad. But numbers 49 and 50 are likely much better than 1 and 2. My point is, these questions are not good questions - what if the answer was 40 years, 50 years, 60 years? Would you not even attempt? What if we told you 6 months, and in 6 months you can\u2019t compose anything? You have two questions - how long does it take to learn to compose AND produce. Two totally different things. To learn to compose usually means you learn to play. To learn to produce doesn\u2019t mean you know at all how to play, but you at least know how to operate a DAW, or any kind of audio-processing and editing software. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s tough to answer. I tried my hand at it when I was a teen and most of what I did was trite. I\u2019ve watched artists do it. In one case the guitarist already had a complete riff built with the concepts of verse, chorus and bridge, but there was no melody or words. The singer then began to improvise lyrics and over the course of several weeks the song developed into such a good song that radio stations immediately picked it up for programming. In another instance she got a device called a QY-10 from Yamaha (no longer available). It had drum tracks, bass, keys, and guitar. You pressed keys to get patterns (you know 1, 4, 5). She recorded a patterned she liked and then added a Glissando (that\u2019s where you put your first finger nail down on the keyboard and then moves it across from one side to the other play each note in rapid succession). Then she added lyrics. This time it was about her love life with a guy and which she described it like a circus or carnival. She recorded that and without a band had a song. She did another song using metaphors and I quickly picked up on it and asked if she was referring to her ex-husband in that song and she said \u201cyes.\u201d She was describing him and his life in metaphorical terms. I can\u2019t, unfortunately, give you more details as I have no rights to use the lyrics. Most songs are personal. They are about what you are and what you do. This song was about her life in music with dark alley ways, dim lit halls, sleeping on floors. She turned it into a story. If you look at the lyrics of most songs you\u2019ll find that they, too, are stories about what goes on in the life of the composer. Some songs are, however, assembled based on things they saw. A lot of Paul McCartney\u2019s songs are like that. Penny Lane. Elleanor Rigby. While other songs of his like For No One was about his rocky love life with Jane Asher. I suspect You Won\u2019t See Me and Drive My Car might also be about life with Jane. Paperback Writer what done by McCartney on a dare to write a hit song that wasn\u2019t about love. Since I don\u2019t think he ever wrote a book that song was not about him. Might have been about John who did write a book. One songwriter I know of creates a song based on a science fiction book. I used to love to experiment with chords I learned. Mostly from Jim Webb, Nilsson and the Beatles. They\u2019d do these Major Minor chords (like Dear Prudence) or suspended 5th (Hey Jude and some of Nilsson\u2019s songs). Of course songs are often built on patterns. 1, 4, 5, 1 (C, F, G, C). 1, minor 6, 4, 5, 1 (C Aminor, F, G, C). If you analyze songs you\u2019ll see what common patterns arise. You can\u2019t be sued over patterns, just over lyrics or melody. As for producing, you simply have to produce. It\u2019s a good idea to know music. Know how to play an instrument. Know how to arrange. Know how to mic a band. Know how to mix multi-tracks. You also have to be a people person and a psychologist. You have to know when a band is tired and needs to go into the Jacuzzi or go home and sleep, even though the studio is costing you $500 an hour while they do this. Tired Musicians record out of tune. Record lousy tracks. Record durges. You should also know session musicians and have a list of drummers, guitarists, bassists and keyboard players you can call upon to come in and do tracks. The best way to learn producing is to do it. Invest about $2,000 and get your own equipment and start recording and producing bands. A Zoom R-16, some SM 57 and 58 Mics, stands, mic cords. This will work for both location and studio (it\u2019s battery powered). Records 8 track which is enough to get you started. That way you have to conserve tracks and record two signals on one track sometimes. That teaches you engineering and production. You learn from your mistakes. So record bands for free until you know better. A producer learns how to get a sound. Usually with effects. And not just dipping a track, but playing with the effect. You have to learn how to get the best performance out of a band or player. You have to learn how to piece a song together. I did one song in which we recorded the electric tracks. Then in the middle I had the guitarist do an accoustic track and keep playing all the way to the end. THen we went back and layered in mallates on the cymbals. We toyed with adding rain sound, but the drummer and I eventually decided it sounded more like bacon cooking than rain so we didn\u2019t use it. I added the sound of car doors slamming. Tires screetching. Traffic on the street to the start of one song. For this movie I was working on where the actors was setting off one music box after another and eventually all four were playing I simply recorded all four on four separate recording tracks. We\u2019d then PUNCH in the tracks one by one during video mixdown. These are things you think of as a producer. HOW to do something. I also did marketing and got them into a radio station and got them radio play which got them into ASCAP back when you had to be played on radio to join ASCAP. ",
