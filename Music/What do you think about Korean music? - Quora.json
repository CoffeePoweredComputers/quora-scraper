            "answer_text": "Mostly I am aware of k-pop but I also had a glimpse into other genres (the usual slow songs). I like k-pop. The beats are good, there tends to always be at least a little originality. Most rappers rap extremely well it makes my head spin from giddiness (e.g Zico, August D, Yongguk\u2026). The vocals are amazing 99% of the time. A lot of high voices (please check out Hui\u2019s navigation, he can go so high!), and K-pop is infamous for well choreographed dances as well. I love the music. However most of the time I regret that the idols went into k-pop because of the extreme hardships they go through. Lack of freedom, exhaustion, limited freedom in terms of even speech or actions (a lot is controlled), fake personas given by companies just to please the fans\u2026.and on and on. The worst are the toxic or anti-fans. I don\u2019t want to go on that road today but toxic fans really leave me speechless. A few idols have gone down because of the multitude of those fans and their spiteful ness. May they Rest In Peace. Makes me really mad how such beautiful voices will never get to be heard again, smiles would never be seen again, positive or negative or any kind of feelings wouldn\u2019t be felt. Nothing. If you are willing to offer support to k-pop, please do. Sometimes I just want to outnumber the mean comments so that all they see is good and reasons to keep going in their complicated life. Based on the music they produce, sing, write lyrics, they really deserve to be heard. Plus it\u2019s great music. Peace. ",

Kpop is good in many ways but is very toxic then the america music industry and I feel like kpop won\u2019t grow unless they change their ways.  ",
