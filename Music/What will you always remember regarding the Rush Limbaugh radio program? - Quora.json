            "answer_text": "I look forward to who\u2019s next. Perfect gig for Lou Dobbs. But my money\u2019s on Bill O\u2019Reilly. Or Mark Levin; he\u2019s at least had some practice behind the golden mic. No one has been more toxic though than Limbaugh in recent years. Many are equally toxic; the GOP has a deep bench. Some of their rank will be looking for new jobs. Perhaps Mark Meadows; he\u2019s well enough known. Reince Priebus? Jim Jordan! Jim Jordan can soliloquize with the best of them and for just as long, about nothing and everything, spittle flying, corrupting the airwaves with his crazy, saying nothing of value every moment that he\u2019s on-air. On the other hand, he\u2019s running for POTUS in \u201824. So he\u2019ll not opt for the better paying gig until after. Come to think of it, how about Trump? He\u2019s got the hair for radio. And he can bloviate endlessly. And does so daily anyway. Perfect job for Trump. And if he happens to find himself imprisoned, maybe one of his namesakes could take over. Trump Junior could fill the seat. And Guilfoyle could help scream into the microphone for a couple minutes every hour. They\u2019ll need a gig and they\u2019d love it; it\u2019s never about the money with these people. Correction- it\u2019s always about the money. Ooh, ooh. I\u2019ve got it. Give Rush\u2019s seat to Ivanka. She could purr into that microphone and come off as almost reasonable- the Comforting Voice of the new GOP! Gotta love it. Ivanka with the Golden Mic. How perfect. She should encrust it with blood diamonds, too, so that it feels more natural; or cubic zirconia if she\u2019s feeling grifty, I mean thrifty. And she\u2019d have several years\u2019 worth of a platform to prepare the voters\u2019 minds for her coming-out party. Like her Dad had with his Apprentice Show. She\u2019ll come out on stage to run for POTUS in 2032. After Kamala Harris\u2019 eight years, the country will have learned how well off we\u2019d become with a woman President. Even Republicans will have learned that. Ivanka in \u201832! ",

            "answer_text": "What will you always remember regarding the Rush Limbaugh radio program? Well, it seems here that those with a preconceived agenda are rearing their ugly heads in the responses here! What do I remember the most about his radio show? His tongue and cheek ability to poke fun at the hypercritical things that some liberals do. He just says it and has fun! One of the most memorable things that he had mentioned was that an all women\u2019s College had opened itself up to allow male students, but hardly anybody male signed up. And then Rush makes the comment I wonder why? Saying it sarcastically, and yet being right on the mark with that statement! Another one of his memorable comments came when he was complaining about just how hot and humid NYC was! One of the weather reporters at his flagship station, oh, don\u2019t worry, by September some type cooling wave system always comes about, and makes everything bearable again. Sure enough, that was exactly what happened, and Rush could not say enough praises about this weather guy! My final opinion, I like him, he is ok and probably a fairly decent person to be around. Now, I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a staunch conservative at all. In fact, I even abhor it much of the With that said, it is the simple fact that he can make talking about news and politics entertainable. I am still waiting for a broadcaster from the left-side do the very same thing! They can\u2019t though, because most liberals cannot simply step back, and laugh at themselves! ",
