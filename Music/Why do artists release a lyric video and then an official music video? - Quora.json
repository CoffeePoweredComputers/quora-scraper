            "answer_text": "An artist will release a lyric video before an official music video for two reasons. Practical / Timing: A lyric video is much easier to produce and release (especially timed with the release of a single, album, or EP). There are even artists who will ask their fans to create the lyric video for them. An official music video usually involves a bigger production budget and cost, and as a result takes more time to create. Why miss out on revenue/visibility from a release just because you didn\u2019t have the official music video ready?Creativity: The lyric video gives an opportunity to show off the text/wordplay and keep the focus on that aspect of the song. An official music video is another chance to show an entirely new interpretation of the work. Some of the best music videos build upon a song by taking it into an entirely different direction (i.e. Michael Jackson \u201cThriller\u201d).",

            "answer_text": "Well there's two reasons behind that as far as I can understand! Firstly Lyric videos are always made available on YouTube which means that the artists can make more money using advertisement that are played before the actual video. So a lyric video is additional income earned apart from the music video. Secondly it is the easiest way to find out how the world is responding to the song because why spend a lot more money making an expensive music video with sets and casting if the song isn't a hit! After all it's a waste money and resources. ",
