            "answer_text": "Most popular song tend to have generic lyrics with the exceptions of some songs that do have meaningful lyrics. There are many factors for the popularity of that have horrible songs. Advertisment is a big one. When artist release a new song there is heavy advertising for the song in social media, radio, tv, etc. Trying to push the song to the audience. After a lot of repetition of that newly released song it becomes catchy after the audience has gotten a lot of exposure to it. Another factor is people have different taste in music even if it\u2019s not the best an they just like those horrible written songs. Another reason for horrible lyrics is that this generation likes music that makes great for partying not understanding the song in it\u2019s entirety . So as long as the beat is good they are not worried about understanding the meaning of a song. ",

            "answer_text": "Unbeknownst to most people they actually like horrible things that they can relate to. Whether it's guns and hoes or the devil scorching the earth they can imagine it clearly. Where as positive thoughts and images don't stay in the mind quite as long or vividly and seem to be \u2018fake\u2019 if you will. That's just my personal construct as of why there are such terrible lyrics in modern music, I personally love positive vibes and images. Reggea music can clear the mind and soul, which is one reason I love it. And most modern music has a catchy \u2018beat\u2019 as most people say. But if they looked long enough the good stuff is right around the corner. ",
