            "answer_text": "It is present in the saranagati gadyam, a hymn written by Ramanuja, the great 13th century teacher of Vishnu Bhakti and Vedanta from Tamil Nadu. He implores Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi to take compassion on him and give him refuge from the sorrows of existence. Towards the end of the hymn is present to shloka you just cited, in which he calls Lord Vishnu his mother, father, brother, friend, and the only thing he knows. However I don't know whether Ramanuja authored the particular verse or whether he was quoting the verse from another work. ",
