            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I\u2019m not a literary expert. I haven\u2019t read most of the other answers, or any other theories about the song, so this is just my own interpretation, most of it probably wrong. Like brain surgery, literary theory is probably best left to the experts. The most obvious themes are Judaism and, like most of Cohen\u2019s oeuvre, romantic love, with, again typically, a sort of nostalgic, \u201cbroken\u201d, feel. This is a very good song, with a few points perhaps hammered home a bit too overtly but no words that really don\u2019t need to be there. It\u2019s an exploration of individuals\u2019 futile search for meaning in love, words, and religion. Cohen was both a Jew and a Buddhist, and of course a Canadian which meant he was also steeped in a western post-Christian culture. He often incorporates \u201cChristianised\u201d ideas of his Jewish tradition. Of course, Christians recognise the Jewish Bible as their \u201cOld Testament\u201d. Generally, Cohen\u2019s raison d\u2019etre, if one was to believe in such things, seems to have been to suffer, but much more slowly than Isaiah\u2019s suffering servant, and not so much to hold a candle as to remind us that darkness is not a thing in itself but just a low amount of light. Romantically, Cohen generally seems to see love as the desire to be fully alive, to find some deeper meaning in the struggle and futility of it all, a desire that is ultimately futile but more important than anything else. Maybe he got this idea from his long struggle with depression, maybe he got it from his Buddhism, or maybe he got it from being human and introspective. Cohen reportedly once said he never married because he wasn\u2019t brave enough. Relationships are one of the most primal drives and, like life itself, often don\u2019t work out quite as we intended. Leonard Cohen is the poet of brokenness, not in the gauche Christian sense of providing a fix, but in the sense of reminding us that this is what life is about. Hollywood tells us that really living is what other people do; poets like Cohen remind us that you and me, simple, struggling, broken, people, are real people, and our lives are real lives. \u201cThere is a crack in everything, that\u2019s how the light gets in,\u201d he says in another song. Still, our desire for spirituality is quite primal, and Cohen often conflates love and religion in his songs. This is actually a very Christian idea, but also one that\u2019s popular in other traditions such as Hinduism. Perhaps Cohen is aware that in Christianity, the marriage relationship is explicitly understood as a metaphor of the relationship between humans and the divine (in fundamentalist terms, the relationship between \u201cGod\u201d and the \u201cbelievers\u201d, but of course Cohen isn\u2019t into simplistic certainties). He draws out this metaphor almost too explicitly in this song. Let\u2019s look at the lyrics line by line: Now I've heard there was a secret chordThat David played, and it pleased the Lord This is a very clear reference to a story in the Jewish Bible (Christian \u201cOld Testament\u201d) which you can read here: 1 Samuel 16:14-23 I\u2019m kind of surprised that Cohen doesn\u2019t reference King David more often in other places. David was a very Cohenesque kind of hero. He is of course one of the greatest Biblical heroes in Judaism, and even in Christianity. In many ways he\u2019s thought of as the founder of ancient Israel as an orderly Kingdom. He is attributed with writing most of the Psalms\u2014the books of poetry in the Bible. But he\u2019s also a very broken hero. He murdered, lied, disobeyed clear commandments from his God, committed adultery, married multiple women, and engaged in bloody wars for personal gain. Note that Cohen changes the Biblical myth quite a bit, to make it more palatable. He isn\u2019t into taking these things too literally. But you don't really care for music, do you? It\u2019s not clear what he means here. Perhaps he\u2019s addressing the imaginary lover in the song. Or perhaps it\u2019s the idea that we all feel there is something more to music, like love, that we miss out on. Perhaps he\u2019s just grumpy that maybe his song would not be recognised (it wasn\u2019t, for ten years). It goes like this, the fourth, the fifthThe minor fall, the major liftThe baffled king composing \"Hallelujah\" I don\u2019t understand the chord sequence so I googled for it and Rolling Stone (How Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' Brilliantly Mingled Sex, Religion) says it\u2019s quite literally the structure of the song, and most pop songs. It also points out that a minor key is considered less \u201chappy\u201d than a major key. \u201cHallelujah\u201d is of course a word that religious people use to express a sense of awe at what they perceive as God. It\u2019s a very common word in the Psalms, which as mentioned above are attributed to David. On his death, Cohen was described as \u201cone of the most explicitly Jewish popular songwriters since the ancient King David, whose Psalms he expertly imitated\u201d (Leonard Cohen's 5 most Jewish songs). It\u2019s a visceral word that you might liken to \u201cwow!\u201d. Sometimes we just want to say \u201cyes!\u201d to life, with no real words, because there is nothing interesting to say but yet life still is \u2026 broken, happy, sad, disappointing, amazing, boring, it\u2019s all those things and more and all you can say is \u201coh\u201d, or \u201cwow\u201d, or, in religious terms, \u201challelujah\u201d (literally \u201cpraise Yahweh\u201d). When David played his harp in this story, he was not yet king, he was a peasant shepherd boy. He played for the King, who was mentally ill. David later became king. Supposedly he had already had a prophecy that this would happen, which might have been why he was \u201cbaffled\u201d, or more probably, as a songwriter like Cohen, he might have found life itself baffling. Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah Your faith was strong but you needed proof Only people who miss the cadences and mystery of life have blind faith. Not Cohen and not, at least in his imagination, King David (who in reality might never have existed, but let\u2019s not go there) You saw her bathing on the roofHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew you Later in King David\u2019s life when he is rich and the king over a united Kingdom of Israel (a rare thing), he gets careless with his power, and sees a Bathsheeba, a married woman, bathing on the roof. We don\u2019t know if she was beautiful but obviously Cohen, who appreciates beautiful women, would imagine she was, and perhaps he imagines it as happening in moonlight because it\u2019s a very imperfect union, lit, but not by what we would consider perfect light. King David\u2019s lust for this woman leads him to murder her husband, but out of their marriage comes King Solomon, another great hero, and generations later, Jesus. You can read the Biblical version of that story here; 2 Samuel 11-12 She tied you to a kitchen chairShe broke your throne and she cut your hairAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Here Cohen is purposefully conflating two Bible stories. He\u2019s continuing on in the story of David and Bathsheba. As you could see in the second half of the story in the Bible that I linked to, David\u2019s murder and adultery (in the Jewish Bible \u201cadultery\u201d is seen more as the \u201csin\u201d of a man stealing another man\u2019s wife, rather than his breaking any marriage vows to his own wives) had serious repercussions (karma?) for him personally, but also for his kingdom. The Kingdom was split during the reign of David\u2019s grandson, Rehoboam the son of Solomon. Perhaps that\u2019s why Cohen refers to Bathsheba breaking his throne. But David\u2019s kingdom was often threatened, particularly by another son from another wife. There\u2019s no mention of him being tied to a kitchen chair, but perhaps Cohen is throwing in a modern-day reference, how marriage ties you to mundane life in a house with a kitchen. But then Cohen clearly conflates the story of Samson and Delilah, which is set much earlier in the Biblical myth. This is the Bible\u2019s ultimate femme fatale story, with the David and Bathsheba story probably a close second. Samson was a powerful superhero and a kind of warlord before the Israelites became a kingdom. His superpower was superhuman strength. As well as that he was a brilliant warrior and went around slaughtering the indigenous people with glee. But Samson had an Achilles\u2019 heel. His strength was conditional on his promise to the god Yahweh, and Samson\u2019s end of the bargain was that he must never cut his hair. Eventually, predictably, Delilah tricks him into revealing his secret and his hair is cut and he ends his life as a blind slave, eventually committing suicide. The femme fatale aspect of the story is hammered home way too obviously in the Bible, so Cohen only hints at the story. You can read the whole story in the Bible here: Judges 13-16 The reference to femme fatales shouldn\u2019t need more explanation. Cohen\u2019s take on this is that they still draw the \u201cHallelujah\u201d. Love, even if it\u2019s broken and ends badly, makes us say \u201cyes\u201d to life. You might find this, or some of Cohen\u2019s other writings about women, somewhat sexist, but I think he is simply writing from his point of view and not expecting us to take any poetry or myth, including the Bible, as literal truth about anything except what it feels like to be alive. Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah Now Cohen switches from the Biblical myth to a more concrete discussion about love. He also seems to switch from addressing a man (symbolised by King David) to a woman). Baby I have been here beforeI know this room, I've walked this floorI used to live alone before I knew you \u201cBaby\u201d acts as a transition signal. It\u2019s not the way you address a famous king. Even in common use, it\u2019s a word that trivialises romantic relationships. Cohen wrote this song when he was fifty. Talking, perhaps, to an imaginary lover, he tells her that he knows how this goes. He\u2019s done it before. It never quite works out, but life and love are Sisyphean, are they not? or, would be, if life wasn\u2019t so short. And of course we all used to live alone before we met our partner, either literally or metaphorically, and perhaps still do, metaphorically.I've seen your flag on the marble arch I didn\u2019t understand this line, but some googling tells me that \u201cMarble Arch\u201d is a famous statue in London that commemorates the British defeat of Napoleon. It\u2019s based on the Arc de Triomph, and the Arch of Constantine. Again, Cohen sometimes uses sexist imagery of love as a man \u201cconquering\u201d a woman. Perhaps though if he was a woman he\u2019s use different imagery and as a poet is entitled to tell us how he feels about it.Love is not a victory marchIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah This kind of offsets the \u201cconquering\u201d metaphor of the previous line. But should love be like a victory march? Perhaps we all feel that it should, but it ends up being \u201cbroken\u201d (a favourite word of Cohen\u2019s) and surprisingly cold. But still something that makes us say \u201cyes\u201d to life. Some recordings of this song have love as a \u201clonely\u201d hallelujah, rather than \u201cbroken\u201d. Both make sense. Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah There was a time you let me knowWhat's really going on belowBut now you never show it to me, do you? Now Cohen talks about love gone bad. After all, he already told us that he knows that\u2019s how it will end, and even before it goes bad it\u2019s ultimately unsatisfactory. Perhaps the first two lines are a fairly crude description of sex that has lost its adventure. Cohen isn\u2019t above using fairly explicit descriptions of sex in his songs. But also these words are deliciously ambiguous and could be thought of as talking directly to God. Does God show us what\u2019s really going on down here on earth? Perhaps there are moments, such as when we fall in love, when we feel like he does, and that last line could apply either to Cohen\u2019s imagining of God, or to a lover.And remember when I moved in youThe holy dove was moving too Again this is probably purposefully ambiguous. It\u2019s probably meant to invoke both the Christian idea of God\u2019s Holy Spirit, and a description of sex. Both of course are further metaphors for the changes we make in our lover\u2019s lives and the depth of connectedness we have with them. The second line seems to explicitly say that he means both. The \u201cHoly Ghost\u201d or the \u201cHoly Spirit\u201d is a Christian idea, not really found so explicitly in Judaism, of God\u2019s actual spirit that works in people\u2019s minds. Nevertheless, theologically, it does tie back to the David story. Note too that Cohen changes the name from the \u201cHoly Ghost\u201d to \u201choly dove\u201d, which is less offensive to Judaism, and invokes the idea of Noah, but is still recognisably Christian (because Christians symbolise the Holy Ghost as a dove). The dove represents peace, and in the Noah story represented the hope in the search for life after everything had been destroyed.And every breath we drew was Hallelujah Again, the explicit message of the song. There are moments that take our breath away, and although they are empty and broken, they are what life is about. Actually, life is about those moments and all the other moments too. Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah You say I took the name in vainI don't even know the nameBut if I did, well really, what's it to you?There's a blaze of light in every wordIt doesn't matter which you heardThe holy or the broken Hallelujah The Hebrew Bible made a big deal about the name of God, which in English we usually render as \u201cLORD\u201d or \u201cJehovah\u201d or more properly, \u201cYahweh\u201d. Etymologically, it\u2019s the \u201cjah\u201d in \u201challelujah\u201d. Jews, as you probably know, were so scared about taking that name in vain that nobody said it and so everybody forgot how to pronounce it. Hebrew only writes the vowels, so we know they were Y/J, H, W, H, but we don\u2019t know what the vowel sounds were. The name of God was the centre of the putative special relationship between God and his chosen people. But they forgot the name, and now Cohen, a Jew, doesn\u2019t even know the name. Did Cohen take the name of love in vain by loving so many women and having meaningless sex with others? But he doesn\u2019t even know the name, because like all of us we don\u2019t know how to love properly. Again, it\u2019s a metaphor for love. Or maybe love is a metaphor for religion. Or maybe both are metaphors. But then every word has a blaze of light in it. Because every word is a way to communicate, to recognise the spark of humanity in each other. And since broken, imperfect, things are holy to Cohen too, this means that every word is sacred, as you\u2019d expect of a wordsmith. Every word, holy, or broken. Every love, holy or broken. Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah Maybe there's a God aboveBut all I've ever learned from loveWas how to shoot somebody who outdrew youAnd it's not a cry that you hear at nightIt's not somebody who's seen the lightIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah In case we didn\u2019t get it in the first five stanzas, Cohen reminds us again that love is a metaphor for God (or, I would say, God is a metaphor for love). But he has a cynical view of love, again as a kind of battle. Perhaps towards the end of the song he talks about the end of relationships. Who initiates the breakup? It\u2019s like a shootout. But all parts of love, and life, are not \u201cEureka!\u201d moments, nor the excited babblings of a convert (\u201cseen the light\u201d is an explicitly Christian phrase, because conversion in Judaism or Buddhism are much slower and procedural). It\u2019s cold, and it\u2019s broken, but it\u2019s still something that makes you say \u201cyes\u201d to life. Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah I did my best, it wasn't much Is he talking about life here, or love?I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch We can\u2019t really feel all the poignancy of life like we really want to, so we try to touch each other, with words and sex. Ultimately they\u2019re cold and broken too, but we must try.I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool youAnd even though it all went wrongI'll stand before the Lord of Song The Lord of Song is a Jewish and Christian phrase referring to God. Again it\u2019s attributed to David, and again it gives primacy to poetry. Again, words are the other way we search for poignancy and connection. Of all the hundreds of descriptions for God in the Old Testament, perhaps \u201cLord of Song\u201d attracts Cohen, the wordsmith and singer, most. The idea that we will stand before God and be judged for our life is again something that\u2019s not emphasised, or believed at all, in most forms of Judaism and makes no sense in Buddhism. But it\u2019s a Christian idea. No doubt Cohen doesn\u2019t believe that this would actually happen. But it\u2019s a useful way to think about our life. Even at fifty, one begins to look back over one\u2019s life and try to evaluate it. And if it was empty and broken, will it pass?With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah If Cohen\u2019s life were to be judged by some imaginary God, he feels that he wouldn\u2019t have much to show. Love and life were cold and broken. He felt like he never quite lived as poignantly as we were meant to. But all he\u2019ll have is the \u201challelujah\u201d, the memory of the times he said \u201cyes\u201d to life, even if it all went wrong at the end. That\u2019s all you can do, that\u2019s all you can have, and anything else is just fooling yourself. Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah Cohen said he sees it as a hopeful song. I don\u2019t think he meant that in the sense that Judaism or love have \u201cthe answer\u201d, or that we can even have a religion or a love that is not fundamentally broken. Rather, I think he meant that there are these tenuous moments when the light gets in, and that is, in a quiet way, hopeful. In the end, Cohen uses more imagery from the Judao-Christian tradition of the religion he remained in and which was his heritage. However, it\u2019s somewhat disparaging. Theistic answers are too simple, as is like the Hollywood message that \u201ctrue love\u201d is the answer. In the end, Buddhism is closer to our experience of life, when all we have is a brief dance around sunyata (emptiness) and our most poignant moments (falling in love) are dhuka. This is a song that uses Judaism as a starting point but does not find its answers in Judaism, nor anywhere else. Cohen was a poet and knows that all we have is the questions. ",

            "answer_text": "This song seems rather confusing, precisely because it deals with dualities in life, good/bad, love/loss, faith/fear, and yet at the end it comes back to reaffirm that despite its imperfections, life is wonderful, and it goes on. The text here is from his version, but some people have reported that he wrote, and on different occasions sang, up to 80 verses, so there apparently is no definitive text. Though this version does not emphasize love, some of the versions, depending on the verses they choose, definitely do. Many other singers have covered this song, and most of those use at least some different verses. When they choose those verses, they can also put emphasis on happiness or sadness and loss, or life and love, depending on those particular verses. There is no clear, one interpretation on the meaning of this song, because, like many works of art, it is deep and complex and means different things to different people, but let's start with some common meanings that are attributed to it: First, understand what is the primary word here: Hallelujah, which essentially means, \"Glory to God,\" or, \"Praise be to God.\" But it can also mean, in a more vernacular way, \"Life is amazing,\" or other, similar things. The way it is used in this song is really just as a word that is an affirmation of life, ALL of life. Cohen himself said he chose that word because it means so much in so many ways. In other words, it is a word of awe, of inspiration, of gratitude and of praise, and many many other things. In some cases it can even be a word of sarcasm or scorn, but in the end, it returns to praise and wonder. Far from being a \"filler\" word, it is really the core word of the whole song, and it is repeated 33 times in the song. Every verse ends in the word Hallelujah, and each of those Hallelujahs is different. Now I've heard there was a secret chordThat David played, and it pleased the LordBut you don't really care for music, do you?It goes like thisThe fourth, the fifthThe minor fall, the major liftThe baffled king composing Hallelujah [Who is he talking to here? Someone who he cares about. He essentially is saying, \"The Lord,\" was pleased by the musician \"Kind David's\" efforts, but \"you, the person he cares about\" aren't so impressed by his efforts, are you. He implies that he is David, trying to find the \u2018secret chord\u2019 so that he can get understanding in love. Since it isn\u2019t working he tries to explain what he is doing, and how he is doing it, but he realizes that he is the baffled king, and that he really can never truly get his meaning across. He understands that he is incapable of the full communication he wants. In the end it is okay because things are amazing, anyway.] HallelujahHallelujahHallelujahHallelujah Your faith was strong but you needed proofYou saw her bathing on the roofHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew youShe tied you to a kitchen chairShe broke your throne, and she cut your hairAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah [In this second verse he is talking to himself, the point of view character. First line refers to his overall faith, belief and confidence, but also his doubts. He believes in love, but is wary of the pain. Second and third lines refer to surprising, amazing things, including how helpless we sometimes are before the beauty of life. Fourth and fifth lines conflate the stories of King David and Samson, and allude to the calamities that fell upon King David and Samson, and these lines talk about the curves that life or love, or hope, can send our way. It also illustrates how painful and prickly love can be, and how love leads us to surrender some part of ourselves, in order to maintain it, but in the end, it is still wonderful and we can't help but cry, \"Hallelujah.\" If strictly interpreted as talking about love, he is wistful about the wonderful act of falling in love, but also emphasizes that the ones we love can hurt us the most. In the 4th and 5th lines, his lover came back to hurt him, perhaps not intentionally, yet he still finds love amazing.] Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah You say I took the name in vainI don't even know the nameBut if I did, well really, what's it to you?There's a blaze of lightIn every wordIt doesn't matter which you heardThe holy or the broken Hallelujah [In the third verse he is speaking again to the person he wants to understand him. And he is also speaking to himself. In the first and second lines, there is more insecurity and the realization that there is a lack of understanding from the person he is speaking to. Whether that is someone else who doesn\u2019t understand, or even lack of self understanding. Third line essentially affirms that he really would like praise and acceptance, but in the end, he is his own, strong, independent person. Fourth, fifth and sixth lines talk again about the wonder, and the dichotomies of life, and that it is all good. In the end, whether it is holy and perfect or broken and incomplete, it is all still amazing. Interpreted as love, this is his affirmation that he does love, but he doesn't completely understand what love is. Meanwhile, he isn't sure his lover loves him back. Yet even so, love is still incredible, and whether it is perfect or imperfect, it is still amazing.] Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah I did my best, it wasn't muchI couldn't feel, so I tried to touchI've told the truth, I didn't come to fool youAnd even though it all went wrongI'll stand before the Lord of SongWith nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah [Last verse shows that he, the point of view person, realizes that his efforts are meager, they will never be enough, but he has a core of honesty and character, and that even though his efforts will never be enough, they were still worthwhile, and deserving of respect, and acceptance. And if others won\u2019t accept him, then he will accept himself. Still talking about the quandary of love and communications between people, he explains how he tried to communicate his love, and when words weren't enough, he tried to show it with physical actions, but in the end, it still wasn't enough. Yet he has no regrets.] Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah [Two verses that are not in the original Cohen recording, but which are in many of the other recorded versions, especially by other singers, are listed below. Obviously, these verses focus much more on the bittersweetness of love and loss.] \"Baby I've been here beforeI've seen this room and I've walked the floorI used to live alone before I knew yaBut I've seen your flag on the marble archOur love is not a victory marchIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah Maybe there's a God aboveBut all I've ever learned from loveWas how to shoot somebody who outdrew yaIt's not a cry that you hear at nightIt's not someone who's seen the lightIt's a cold and broken Hallelujah Hallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah...\" In the end, Cohen himself said, \"There is a religious Hallelujah, but there are many other ones. When one looks at the world and his proper life there's only one thing to say, it is 'Hallelujah.'\"  \"The Hallelujah, the David's Hallelujah, was still a religious song. So I wanted to indicate that Hallelujah can come out of things that have nothing to do with religion.\" \"And then I realized there is a Hallelujah more general that we speak to the world, to life.\" ",

            "answer_text": "I think the song has two different meanings layered into the same lyrics. The first and most obvious meaning is recounting the biblical story of the rise and fall of of King David. Cohen used this I think as a way to express his own issues with women and sex - he was a well known womaniser who had issues sustaining a relationship - so the biblical story of David is a reference - a metaphor to express that. Thus it has both a personal meaning relating to Cohen\u2019s own life - and a divine metaphysical interpretation related to the biblical story as well. The early parts of the song clearly trace the story of King David as a young shepherd boy playing his harp to sooth the spirit of the afflicted King Saul. Here through David\u2019s holy and righteous life - David finds favour with the lord and receives his holy spirit. Many people think the latter sections of the song then switches to another biblical story and refers to story of Samson because of the \u201chair\u201d reference but I don\u2019t think its meant that way. The other verses all clearly refer to King David\u2019s story and I believe these lines do as well. Your faith was strong but you needed proofYou saw her bathing on the roofHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew yaShe tied you to a kitchen chairShe broke your throne, and she cut your heirAnd from your lips she drew the hallelujah You will notice I have written this as \u201cheir\u201d not \u201chair\u201d. These lines refer to King David\u2019s adulterous relationship in later life with Bathsheba. See here ->Bible Gateway passage: 2 Samuel 11 David being a holy man of faith became king because of his good character and favor with the lord - but he fell from God\u2019s graces and was severely punished for his sins after he saw a married women Bathsheba bathing from his palace rooftop. He called for her, and despite the fact she was married to a soldier under his command - Uriah - he had sex with her and got her pregnant. He then arranged to have her husband Uriah sent to the front of the battle lines so he would be killed and he could take her as his wife. After doing this she then went on to bear his first son. As punishment from God for these deeds his kingdom fell into civil war, his first born child was then struck down ill and died - and eventually someone close to him later claimed himself as king forced him from the city and had relations with his wives in public view. Thus the breaking of his throne and cutting of his \u201cheir\u201d: the first born \u201cheir\u201d to his throne and kingdom, not \u201chair\u201d on his head as in the story of Samson. Sam 2:13 - Nathan replied, \u201cThe Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die. But because by doing this you have shown utter contempt for the Lord, the son born to you will die.\u201d After Nathan had gone home, the Lord struck the child that Uriah\u2019s wife had borne to David, and he became ill. David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and spent the nights lying in sackcloth on the ground. The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them. On the seventh day the child died. When taking this biblical context the \u201cFrom his lips she drew the Hallelujah\u201d - is not so much about sexual orgasm but more so about how she tempted him into sinful actions which resulted in him falling into ruin and despair. There he once again found god - this time instead of through righteous holy action as he had done previously in his early life - it was through forgiveness, mercy and restoration from god when he was a broken man. (See David\u2019s plea to god for forgiveness -Psalm 51 - Bible Gateway passage: Psalm 51 - English Standard Version). Thus the following lines indicated the different paths David followed to find God. It doesn\u2019t matter which you heard The holy or the broken Hallelujah. ",

Verse by verse: Well I've heard there was a secret chordThat David played and it pleased the Lord King David, from the old testament of the Bible, was known to be a harp player and often wrote spiritual music, though no specific chord was referenced.But you don't really care for music, do you?Well it goes like this:The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift The chords in this part of the song are literally the fourth and fifth in the Key of C, followed by a descending minor and ascending major.The baffled king composing Hallelujah Well your faith was strong but you needed proofYou saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew yaShe tied you to her kitchen chairAnd she broke your throne and she cut your hairAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah again talking about King David, and how he saw a woman named Bathsheba. he wanted her, but she was married. So, he sent her husband off to war where he died, and David married Bathsheba. God punished him for such selfish behavior throughout the rest of his life But baby I've been here beforeI've seen this room and I've walked this floorYou know, I used to live alone before I knew yaAnd I've seen your flag on the marble archAnd love is not a victory marchIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah Commenting on a love that\u2019s over, bitterness and being jaded when it comes to love. Well there was a time when you let me knowWhat's really going on belowBut now you never show that to me do yaBut remember when I moved in youAnd the holy dove was moving tooAnd every breath we drew was Hallelujah The singer misses having conjugal relations with a someone. Maybe there's a God aboveBut all I've ever learned from loveWas how to shoot somebody who outdrew yaAnd it's not a cry that you hear at nightIt's not somebody who's seen the lightIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah The Singer doesn\u2019t see the point in love if it only causes pain and betrayal.

            "answer_text": "There are so many layers of meaning, it's hard to know where to start to interpret it. But here's a stab. I won't reiterate the verses, just state what they mean to me. I also tend to take the view that it's about saying yes to life, in all its wretchedness and beauty, and thanking God for all of it, that's why it doesn't matter which \u201cHallelujah\u201d you heard, the holy or the broken. They're the same in intensity. Possibly the broken one is even holier, because it's easy to sing praise in rapture and pleasure, like when you're in love. It's much harder to see beauty in suffering when the love is over. Many Eastern religions don't see suffering as \u201cbad\u201d, it's merely another interesting experience for the spirit. So everything is Hallelujah. The overall tone of the song, however, is plaintive and brokenhearted. It seems he wrote it from the broken place, in the wake of love. So it feels more like a weary surrender, an awed, humbled and indeed \u201cbaffled\u201d attitude toward the mysterious ways of love and God. And I don't think it's sacrilegious to point this out, but it's definitely about sex too. Absolutely. Being a master poet, he made numerous lines ambiguous, so they could be read as either about religion or sex. I see them as both at once. This is a big part of what makes the song so effective. Instead of drawing a distinction between sacred and profane, he elevates the profane aspects into sacred territory. When every breath they drew was Hallelujah, the Holy Ghost was present for their union, it was consecrated. It was a religious experience. This evokes Tantra, Maithuna, Song of Solomon, sex as a sacred act. There are many ways to experience \u201cHallelujah\u201d the feeling, the mystery and awe that drives you to your knees and draws praise to your lips. Sex is a valid route. So is music. Many musicians describe the creative act as \u201ctheir church\u201d, something supernatural speaking through them that they don't fully understand. Apparently David was in touch with this. At his humblest, he was a lightning rod for the divine. Cohen recognized God in all these things. That's another thing that's more Hindu or Buddhist than Judeo-Christian, the idea that God is manifest in everything. While the more bitter, alienated lines about lost love signal coming from the broken place, it's ultimately hopeful because he's still grateful for having experienced it. Singing praises to the God that let him glimpse love, however fleeting, and feel this pain too. Thanking Him for both. It's despondent but glorious. I recently stumbled across a definitive list of covers, ranging from the awful to the amazing: 60 Versions of Leonard Cohen\u2019s 'Hallelujah,' Ranked Jeff Buckley's version is my favorite by far. His minor-scale guitar picking and passionate voice reached that same plaintive quiet place of resignation. However that review was written before Leonard Cohen died in 2016, which was also when Hillary Clinton lost the election. That week, Kate McKinnon sang a beautiful tribute on SNL's cold open dressed as Hillary. It was perfect. It served as an elegy and a hopeful rallying message at the same time. She left out the sexual verses and kept the more reverent ones, so it could almost be interpreted as a love letter to the country. She concluded by saying (choking back emotion), \u201cI'm not giving up, and neither should you.\u201d If there is a sister song to \u201cHallelujah\u201d, I consider \u201cIf It Be Your Will\u201d, from the same album, in the very same spirit. If it be your willThat I speak no moreAnd my voice be stillAs it was beforeI will speak no moreI shall abide untilI am spoken forIf it be your willIf it be your willThat a voice be trueFrom this broken hillI will sing to youFrom this broken hillAll your praises they shall ringIf it be your willTo let me sing If you listen to these verses in a time of lost or unrequited love, it seems like a surrender to a lover. Again, broken. This broken hill. But subsequent verses sound more like a hymn to God. It's a powerful combination. That ambiguity is what makes these songs magical. ",

            "answer_text": "This song interleaves the love beween a man and a woman with the love between mankind and  God. The word Halleluja is the thread that binds these themes.  This is not a traditional love song or a hymn. It comes from a place of great pain, love turned sour, and from a broken man who questions God.  The woman is a believer in the ideals of love and faith. The singer is not. There is an antagonistic tone between the man and the woman from the start of the song. He feels that she has a idealistic and rosy view of love and faith. She feels he does not truly believe in either.  Yet at one time the lovers were engulfed in an intense love. Now the singer feels he was seduced and consumed by a force greater than himself. In their love he saw the divine, in their love he saw his destruction.   To her the word Hallelujah is joyous and uttered from a place of faith. To him Hallelujah comes from a place that is \"cold and broken.\" The key line of the whole song elevates this theme to a higher metaphysical level:   \"There's a blaze of light in every word It doesn't matter which you heard The holy or the broken Hallelujah\" To Cohen \"light\" is loaded with layers of metaphysical meaning. We come full circle to the introduction of the song, which references the biblical David's \"secret chord\" that \"pleased the Lord\" and the seductress Delilah.  The light is the spark of the divine. And it is in \"every word\". Words are the key unit of our human experience. They are imperfect for expressing it, but they are all we have. Words give our souls a means to speak to the world. Great lyrics like these are more than the sum of their words. They strike a chord. This is the same \"Light\" Cohen sings of in \"Anthem:\"  Ring the bells that still can ring Forget your perfect offering There is a crack, a crack in everything That's how the light gets in. That's how the light gets in. That's how the light gets in.  What did Leonard Cohen mean by:\"There is a crack, a crack in everythingThat's how the light gets in\"? The whole of experience is divine, the triumphs and the destitution. There is no difference between cursing and praising God. As long as we face love and loss with our hearts and minds open to the infinite possibility of the moment we are participating in the divine. (Note: the Jeff Buckley version left out some of the key metaphysical lyrics) ",

You can interpret this lyric by applying the words to your life experiences and feelings. Poetry is to be listened to and felt and for me to tell you it means this\u2026is to just reveal how it applied to my life and my feelings. I see it as more of a broken and lost romance rather than a religious song, but many people have altered or changed the lyrics to make it religious. Read the words, listen to the song and think how it makes you feel. ",

The song as far as I\u2019m concerned is about a sexual experience, namely the female orgasm. Cohen is clever enough to fool those who don\u2019t look deeply and simply listen on a basic or naive level. To point that the naive use this cry for release as a hymn or Christmas Carol. I think he must smile. I do. As with any master of his craft he also uses many other other illustrative tools but all lead to the crescendo of this release\u2026 Hallelujah! Though, many listen are watch something and draw different meanings from the same content. Similar to how my adult children see the things I say and do, entirely differently my intention. Listen, you will hear direct reference to this simple, yet relevant to each male and female. PS : Tell me what \u201cJoan of Arc\u201d is about. I\u2019d love to hear your opinion. I wonder if anyone interprets it the same as I do. I tend to be a deep thinker. I\u2019ve had these songs with me since their release in 1969, and drew my analysis in my youth and continue to feel the same. Leonard Cohen, the \u201cnon Jew\u201d, continues to rock my world. Interesting in the DVD, \u201cI\u2019m your man\u201d he says his becoming a monk was only following protocol. The terms of his deep companion with the Zen Master dictated his necessity to partake in this ritual. Further to, it was great to hear him expel his \u201cwomaniser\u201d reputation. Where he says if you just knew the 10,00s of nights he slept alone. All the best, Mal ",

            "answer_text": "After reading some excellent answers, I will try to write something I feel is the song.. Leonard is speaking of the confusion and overarching yearning for meaning as a human living here on Earth in relationship to God. He assumes his need to have God in his life at every juncture, no matter how lonely or connected or unconnected. Love is the force. Love for God is the constant. Using powerful biblical stories , he juxtaposed the past and present. Alternately he scans the same of his own life. He speaks of his music in terms of biblical musical communications between God and King David. It's imagery is incredible. Music is sacred and secret. But here, the live that Leonard seems to be marking his own life by, he is describing, remarkably someone who does not share his passion for music. She doesn't even care. How could this woman be his true love? The object of his love indepently lives her time and gives love and lovemaking to him through her own cares, personal involvement, time and needs. We are fluid. He wants something etherial. Its not a crime that I'm here tonight. Hoping to to rekindle a flame. His desire to revisit and explore the past life that he too never nurtured over time. But every joy and every sorrow is punctuated with Praise be the Lord. The most obvious way to feel close to G-d is to be in passionate love. Its a high that leaves little to want. The subsequent fear of losing it brings us close too. Often thanking, often asking. And asking again. It's easier to not need God if one is surrounded with earthly love. In loneliness we look back and wanting to reach out, wanting to recreate a memory that can not be recreated. The reality is that the differences drove you apart, despite the perception of its perfectness at it's highest moments. Thank you G-d. For it all. All of life. All of love. All of it. For ecstacy, for absence, for loneliness, seasons, joy, for bible, for stories, for music, for yearning. In everything; it's always Hallelujah. Its broken, its drawn, its forced, it whispered, sung, it's shouted, screamed, its cried. For every experience toward the end. Thank you. Hallelujah. I trust my Lord to make sense of my struggle.. I love Leonard Cohen. It took him 5 years to write this. Hallelujah. CK ",

He\ufeff can only scream in release giving into the passion of the moment as she drains his power (cuts his hair) even takes his thrown. Yet he cares not. The release of all that heartbreak and turmoil is the end all and the cure all. It is so wrong but so right. But love is sacred, not something to be controlled or toyed with (Love is not a victory march. I\u2019ts a cold and it\u2019s a broken hallelujah.) It can come & go if it's sacred nature is not understood. The speaker has done his best, but it's not enough. In the end he is only\ufeff human, a man of passion who doesn't quite understand it all. In exasperation, in full release to the elements and the gods: Hallelujah!\ufeff Free at last! Free at last. Lord GOD! almighty, free at last. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Hallelujah\" was first released in 1984 as part of Cohen's album \"Various Pleasures.\" Cohen wrote over 80 verses to the song before eventually trimming the lyrics down to the four verses heard in the final version. The song contains numerous allusions to Biblical figures, such as King David, and juxtaposes religious sentiment with dry, ironic humor. The song has been described as being about the frustration of songwriting itself and Cohen's personal frustration with the commercial failure of his previous records, despite critical acclaim. The song remained relatively obscure until a cover version by Jeff Buckley, released posthumously, became a smash success. Since then, \"Hallelujah\" has frequently been used in movies and TV shows, such as \"Shrek\" and \"The West Wing,\" and it is often played at private gatherings, such as weddings and funerals. Other artists who have covered the song include John Cale, Amanda Palmer, Willie Nelson and Bono. \"Hallelujah\" has become one of the most covered songs in the world, though different artists often perform the song with less cynicism than Cohen Signature: HaThu  ",

Not a fan. I can only take so much of grandma getting run over by a reindeer\u2019, pa-rump-pa-pum-pum. It\u2019s not the holiday music that annoys me, but the complete alteration of my favorite station. I understand. A transition from \u2018Pearl Jam\u2019 or \u2018Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man\u2019 to \u2018Don\u2019t Shoot Me Santa\u2019 would be a bit of a shock, so I go elsewhere for my car tunes. Another reason I avoid non-stop holiday music is the limited number of selections, forcing stations to sssstrrretch their list. I come to my point with a brief story. My wife, let\u2019s call her Jen, loves Christmas. Needless to say, the dial in her car is preset to holiday music. Recently, she noticed an attempt by her station to proffer their Yuletide list with \u2018Pentatonix\u2019 adaptation of \u2018Hallejulah\u2019. I enjoy the original version written and recorded by the late \u2018Leonard Cohen\u2019. That said, \u2018Hallejulah\u2019 has nothing at all to do with Christmas or the holidays. It\u2019s about the energy that goes into an intimate relationship. It\u2019s about love gone wrong, turned sour, and the pain that accompanies it. Cohen relays the story of a broken man who questions God. Listen closely and you\u2019ll hear the pain in his voice. Merry Christmas everybody! Don\u2019t think so. Hello programmers, where art thou? Holiday songs shouldn\u2019t make the cut because they contain a word, or two, that fit the season. Or because they are featured on the latest, hottest album. When asked; \u2018Hallejulah\u2019 what\u2019s it to you? It\u2019s a sad song that moves me to tears. Definitely not on my list of holiday favorites.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s comparing the sexual experience of an orgasm to a religious epiphany. Edit This answer was collapsed due to down voting, presumably by people who didn't like the answer. However, it remains correct. This is a song comparing sex to religion. Consider the verse: Your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you She tied you to her kitchen chair She broke your throne and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah This is demonstrating the similarity of sexual gratification, with a religious experience. The point if orgasm is clearly shown in a religious context, drawing the analogy between sexual gratification and the expression of religious joy. It draws an analogy with the Samson and Delilah story, which is pretty overtly sexual in itself. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some quotes from Leonard Cohen that may shed some light on this question and give us some interesting perspectives about the meaning of this song: \u201cI wanted to get into this tradition of the composers who said \u201cHallelujah\u201d, but with no precisely religious point of view.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s, as I say, a desire to affirm my faith in life, not in some formal religious way, but with enthusiasm, with emotion\u201d (Leonard Cohen interview, 1985). \u201cI wanted to write something in the tradition of the hallelujah choruses but from a different point of view\u201d(Leonard Cohen interview, 1995). The traditional \u201cHallelujah\u201d is an ancient word of prayer, used for expressing a person\u2019s or a nation\u2019s gratitude, love and loyalty to their lord \u2013 calling out: \u201cLet\u2019s all praise the lord\u201d. Cohen wanted to be \u2013 in some way \u2013 a continuer of this tradition, although it would be independent of any religious framework .Cohen has a new way, a new meaning for the \u201cHallelujah\u201d. He wants to call out his own \u201cHallelujah\u201d to the Lord, to the world and to life. \u201cThere is a religious Hallelujah, but there are many other ones .When one looks at the world and his proper life there\u2019s only one thing to say, it is \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 \u201c. \u201cThe Hallelujah, the David\u2019s Hallelujah, was still a religious song. So I wanted to indicate that Hallelujah can come out of things that have nothing to do with religion\u201d. \u201cAnd then I realize there is a Hallelujah more general that we speak to the world, to life\u201d.

            "answer_text": "King David was a strong follower of God and a musician. He is credited with writing most of the songs contained in psalms. He saw Bathsheba bathing naked on the roof of her house and desired her. So he slept with her, then sent her husband to the front lines to increase the chance that he would not survive the current war.  The song is overtly about stories from the Bible. The first two verses focus a lot on King David and then make mention of Samson losing his hair to his lover. On the underside however, the song evokes strong images of how love can overpower even the strongest men. And I've always felt that it was sort of saying that even being broken by love can create a beautiful thing. The song ends on a slightly more hopeful note as well. And whatever it's fully about. There's no denying that it's a beautiful song in its own right.  ",

In \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 he talks about this indirectly and poetically, with biblical and other references; in his 1967 song \u2018So Long Marianne\u2019 (So Long, Marianne - Wikipedia) he tackles the events more directly.

He says the only prayer he knows \u201cFor what we are about to receive, lord make us truly thankful\u201d.It also reminds me of the quote Jesus is written to have made on the cross \u201cWhy have you forsaken me?\u201dHe was quoting King David where he wrote that when things are bad it feels like you have been abandoned by god but its not really true.For me, the song is a very sad song when things feel so low you cannot see anything other than the bad things.

Cohen has said of the song's meaning: \"It explains that many kinds of hallelujahs do exist, and all the perfect and broken hallelujahs have equal value.\"The great poet Leonard Cohen had a religious background. Cohen\u2019s first hit, Suzanne, speaks of perhaps the most famous Jew, Jesus, saying, he himself was broken long before the sky would open. Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone. Cohen, himself was a master of language, saturated his lyrics with Biblical imagery. He was one of the most explicitly Jewish popular songwriters since the ancient King David, whose Psalms he expertly imitated over a five-decade career. ",

To me, he is saying that he has heard that there is a smooth way through life. There is that chord - belief, insight, revelation - that will make life a breeze. So he is using the analogy of himself as the baffled king trying to figure out life. The next verse incorporates David and Bathsheba, along with Samson and Delilah. He had strong faith and optimism, but still there was a nagging doubt. There was the emptiness he felt inside and he tried to fill it with material things. Materialism will fail you. You see, you want, what you want does not deliver, but holds us bound in the illusion that they will deliver. And so on, until he reaches the climatic lyric at what is usually accepted as the end of the song, (I hear there were actually 99 verses). Even though there is no magic formula for happiness, expectations went unmet, still, he can say, I did my best Hallelujah. Hallelujah, here, represents his acceptance of life on life\u2019s terms. Through all my ups and downs, I offer - what some traditions consider to be - the highest praise to have had a chance to experience it all. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s about the Jewish relationship with God. Leonard was raised and lived - despite immersing himself in a number of religions - mostly as an Orthodox Jew. The Orthodox name for God is \u2018HaShem\u2019, which literally means The Name, which is the reference in the 3rd verse to you say I used the name in vain but I don\u2019t even know the name\u2019. He\u2019s saying he can\u2019t know God. In the Jewish conception, you can\u2019t know the mind of God, can\u2019t conceive of God except to say that God is beyond conception. The point as a song is that by torturing David with Bathsheba, God creates through David the great devotional Hallelujah, and that he, meaning Leonard, tries but fails and yet he\u2019ll keep trying so he will in the end stand before HaShem with nothing in his mind, nothing on his tongue but the great devotional Hallelujah drawn out of human longing, lust and love for human and spiritual connection. Tim Buckley added lyrics that make it into a song about failed romantic love, but it\u2019s about God. It\u2019s a Jewish song about the human relationship to God and to creation. ",

The song is the testament of irreverence, yet it sung in churches across the land for it's mysterious and captivating quality. ",
