            "answer_text": "The trend is definitely away from the traditional, 40-minute, 12-song album, with more artists releasing songs one at a time, or in small batches. The current path to pop stardom seems to be via releasing one song at a time on social media. But recording and releasing songs in batches still makes sense in several ways. First, there is a practical aspect. If you are going to take the time and expense to go into a studio, or otherwise set up a recording environment, and bring together musicians, engineers, etc., you might as well make as much use of it as possible. This is not only economical but also yields a consistent sound. From an artistic perspective, there is still value in presenting more than one song at a time; a group of songs can do more than one at expressing a theme, or displaying a variety of styles and sounds. If people like one song they are going to want to hear more, and releasing a set rather than one or two gives that opportunity. Now you are building a fan base for yourself or your band, rather than just for a song. Finally having an album gives you something to sell at your shows and online; spur-of-the moment sales at a merch table or even an honor box on a bar stage is a non-trivial source of income for many artists. For established artists with a web presence or other distribution channel, physical CD sales, even today, remain far more lucrative than streaming revenue. ",

            "answer_text": "1. All this is out there online if you just research it. Anyways, here goes\u2026 There is much more money in selling the physical product. If you\u2019re going to sell your music, You\u2019ll need to decide which songs are going to be your singles. Consult and poll your musical team for the best song of the lot. You need to build interest in advance of your ep or album\u2019s release. So if you build it and you\u2019ve got the goods, again there is much more money in selling the physical product. that being said, there\u2019s nothing that says you can\u2019t release a single a month or whatever time frame works for you and your team. 2. Build lists with fans, music industry people, DJs, journalists, engineers, producers, other artists, send them a lot of buzz with every single release- a month or two ahead of each single/EP/album release. 3. whatever you do, make sure before you release this single, that there are a number of sites with your release date for the EP/album very clearly displayed and featured along with your best single. 4.make sure you have a video, the budget can be animated and/or whatever you like, that launches shortly after the single to support the song, and also to get additional coverage for your upcoming album release on influencers, blogs Press releases, and a lot of various music news sites. you have a large number of angles on the single, like videos of recording details, funny studio stories, the story behind the single, credit and thanks to all the team fans and the people helping behind the scenes. 5.play your single at every live performance after you release it online. Set up distribution for your album with itunes, cd baby amazon with your release date for the EP/album very clearly displayed and featured 6. create a FB event and plan your album release party. send DJs and bloggers and journalists an invite to your Vinyl/CD release party.follow-up with them about 3 weeks before the show. If they haven\u2019t already decided to write about you, this might be the needed push. Plus, you never know if something else they\u2019d planned to cover has fallen through. Remember to always include a link to any press or fan quotes, quality band photos, a link to your press page with some or all audio from your album. 7. Reach out to booking agents to book a tour, attend music conferences and contact festival booking. this is not a business for secret agents who are too shy to meet people. You must take the initiative and introduce yourself to other people. 8. A word of advice, \u201cAlways be kind to those you meet on the way up -because you\u2019ll see them on the way down.\u201d Remain aware, be competent and reliable, and look for each opportunity. Build your contact data lists they can be like gold to you. ",
