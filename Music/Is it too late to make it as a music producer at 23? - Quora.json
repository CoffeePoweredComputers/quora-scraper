            "answer_text": "I think everyone here pretty much told you what you need to know. However, I think your question speaks volumes. It\u2019s a reasonable concern for you to think that it might be too late to start such a career, given the current emphasis on youth culture. Case in point, back at the turn of the century labels were starting to sign artists pretty young. Then one artist, JoJo was signed and released her first album at 14. That seemed to signal something in the business, and all of a sudden A&R guys were looking at signing 12 year old kids. I remember sitting in a meeting at Universal when our Urban A&R rep passed around a picture of a 12 year old he wanted to sign. I remember saying, really? You\u2019re going to sign this? He just said, everybody is looking to sign younger artists, so we need to as well. Sadly, these days if a 25+ artist shows up in LA wanting to make it in music, there\u2019s not many industry reps that would even take a meeting with them. Prime is 15\u201317 years old. Right now I\u2019m working with a 10 year old artist that Beyonce\u2019s company is developing. She\u2019s super talented, but every time she and her parents are in my studio, I remind them that she needs to be a kid too. Don\u2019t go overboard with this right now. Two weeks ago we had her in writing and recording for two solid days - grueling for any of us. I don\u2019t know how the artist kept focus, but she was a trouper. By the second day I was just talking to her and treating her like an adult. Then as they were leaving, they walked out of my studio and into my back yard, and the artist started doing cartwheels across my yard. And that\u2019s when I went, oh yeah. She\u2019s a 10 year old! But I digress. So thankfully, 23 is not too young to start a career in music production. But just to be clear, don\u2019t screw around as if time is on your side. Just get focused and be persistent. If you were already functioning as a seasoned pro at 23, you\u2019d be in good company in LA. So get started now and don\u2019t worry about your age. Just don\u2019t dawdle. If you\u2019re looking for tips on what you can do to get started, or how to start getting your music into the right hands, check out my YT channel. I provide industry tips and production techniques.  Good luck to you! ",

            "answer_text": "No there is no such thing as \u201c\"too late\u201d to be a musician. That is not a real thing at all\u2026 although society and other people will tell you otherwise. If you want to make music you have to completely block that out. As far as \u201cbeing told\u201d to go to University now that you are out no one gets to tell you what to do with your life. It's your life, you are in the drivers seat. People told me I was too old. Thankfully I told them all to zip it. Had I listened I would have never experienced getting signed (at 30), making my MTV debut (at 35), touring across seas (37), or singing on my first feature film (43). Everytime you look back in regret over the time you have wasted, that is time you could have spent making music instead. It is literally the most useless way to spend your time. Stop doing that. Your age as a musician is an asset and never a problem. I repeat, your age is never a problem. What is a problem however is the culture of ageism. That is a huge problem. When I was growing up in the \u201880\u2019s we didn't really have that. It should be challenged everyday by musicians like yourself until the problem is corrected. Do you want to feed the culture of ageism by worrying about wasted time (Something that has no benefit to society) or would you like to pursue your passions and get your music out there and help slay the culture of ageism (which benefits you and society). Its your life and the choice is yours. ",
