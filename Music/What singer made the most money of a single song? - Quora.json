            "answer_text": "I9Hi Are you sitting down? The song that has made the most money was penned by the Hill sisters in 1893. They needed a song to sing for birthdays in their kindergarten class and they came up with HAPPY BIRTHDAY. . It reportedly makes $5.000 per day, $2 million annually. The cost of using it in a movie or TV show is $25.000. Total sales are estimated at a staggering $50 million dollars. Ownership has changed hands a few times. In 1990, Warren Chappell, a music holding group, bought the rights for $15 millions. Here's a little factoid for you. It is illegal to sing this happy birthday publicly in a large group without connection being present. In other words it's a family song that requires you to be related it you're going public. I don't know how they planned on enforcing it White Christmas is #2 with $36 million All info is from the Guinness Book of Records. ",
