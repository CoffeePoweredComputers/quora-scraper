            "answer_text": "If you have difficulties in putting a song together you miss the most important thing, a story and an outline that defines the basics of each and every song written, played and recorded. A story needs certain elements and you have to write down or think about the elements your new song needs. A good way to start is to use a fix arrangement, like that of a typical song played on the radio or a streaming platform. Fill the sequences with certain musical ideas, like a child would fill out fields in a paint book. .. if you still struggle to get a song together, start to create tiny pieces of music, like 30 sec and add those parts together. If you\u2019re able to write down the notes on a sheet of paper to play it afterwards, write down tiny parts and add them together. Don\u2019t get stuck in micro processes you need to think macro and big to get a song together. Once you are a professional you can start with the micro parts because you know how a finished song is created. ",

            "answer_text": "I would ask you a question. How is your music theory? Once you understand music theory, you will understand how to put your song together. If not, you are just guessing and doing it by trial and error. You will figure out how to do it, eventually. Check with your local adult education. One or two classes on music theory will solve your issues. You wouldn't be much of an electrician if you didn\u2019t understand how power flows. A musician needs the tools to make great music. Hope it helps. Steve ",
