            "answer_text": "The root of all price changes is psychology and economics.  I'll give you two concrete examples to understand why stock prices change.  the price of beanie babies the price of securities  If you understand these examples, you will understand: the concept of market makingthe meaning of bid and ask priceswhy and how stock prices change# Example 1: The Price of Beanie Babies  A real life example of supply / demand in action is the price of toys around holiday season.  Around holiday season, parents are rushing to shop for toys for their kids.  Because the demand for toys spike around holiday season, toy merchants raise prices around December Christmas Season.  This is illustrated in the chart below, which is plots the price of Beanie Babies on Amazon. You can see a huge spike in December around Christmas.   Basically, merchants are acting as market makers.  They purchased their toys wholesale, and are offering it at the Amazon market place at a higher price in December, in anticipation of high demand.  If I am in the toy business, there's simply no way I will sell you a hot toy in December for the same price as in the summer.  Through this process, toy merchants are making a profit in the form of a spread.  The buyers of toys (parents) are willing to pay / transact at these prices, because the demand is real.  They also pay higher prices because they have the fear of missing out.  This fear / anticipation combo explains a lot of price surges. # Example 2: The Price of Securities To understand what 'supply and demand' in the context of stocks, let's play a game.  Suppose I am the only person from which you can buy and sell Apple stocks from ($APPL). That makes me the sole market maker and the exchange for Apple stocks. A market maker is someone who you can offload or buy securities from, like a car dealer.  Now, you come to me and ask me what the market for Apple stocks is.  I tell you I can: buy 100 shares at $105.67, and sell 100 shares at $105.69In trader jargon, I'll tell you I am 105.67 bid at 105.69.  Below is real Apple stock market as of 3/24/2016 4:00 PM PST / 7:00 PM EST   Now, let's say you are a big hedge fund, and have a strong conviction that Apple stocks are a great purchase, and wish to buy 1 Million shares.  Yes, 1 Million shares. It's a big number. It's like $110Million dollars worth of Apple stock.  What should you do? Should you buy 105.69 from me, and ask me whether you can purchase another 999,900 shares at the same price? Let's say you did just that.  In that case, I will  first sell you 100 shares at 105.69 as promised, and raise my offer price (the price at which I will sell) By how much? It depends, but for the sake of this game, I will offer you another 5,000 shares at 106.69, a full $1 higher than your original. I'll raise my price because I know you want the shares, and have a big quantity to buy.  It's the same line of thinking as a beanie babies merchant.  I do this because I am a profit maximizing entity.  And in fact, there is no reason for me to sell you 1 Million Apple shares at 105.69, because I will be suddenly short a lot of Apple shares for no reason in particular, and that's pretty risky.  Thus, I will raise my price in part due to the high demand (from you), but also to protect myself.    Now, note that you didn't have to tell me you wanted to purchase 1 million shares at all.  You could have purchased just 100 shares every second, and you will be done purchasing 1 Million shares in just under 3 hours.  But this type of behavior won't go unnoticed by me.  I will 'feel' that there's persistent demand from the buyer side.  And I'll be increasingly careful not to offer good prices, because I just don't know how much you wanted to buy.   I hope this gave you a taste of what 'supply and demand' in the context of stocks is, and why prices change.

            "answer_text": "There are two schools of thought on this very important question. One is rooted in the research of University of Chicago Economics Professor Eugene Fama. This school is the Efficient Market Theory/Buy-and-Hold school. It teaches that investors perform a rational assessment of the future prospects of a stock and thereby set its price. Some investors obviously make mistakes in judgments. But since there is a profit to be made in \"exploiting\" those mistakes (by taking the other side of a trade), the market as a whole is able to squeeze out mispricings. Thus, the only thing that can cause price changes is new information, economic developments of some sort that were unknown to investors at the time when the earlier price was set. The second school of thought is rooted in the research of Yale Economics Professor Robert Shiller. Shiller has done research showing that valuations affect long-term returns and thereby discrediting the Efficient Market Theory. Both overvaluation and undervaluation are irrational phenomena (the rational thing would be to price stocks properly). Under the Shiller model (behavioral finance), price changes are the result not of rational responses to economic developments but of swings in investor emotion from irrational optimism to irrational pessimism. The one follows from the other. Irrational optimism causes price crashes and price crashes cause irrational pessimism. The implications of a decision to follow one model or the other are far-reaching. 90 percent of the investing advice we hear today is rooted in the Buy-and-Hold Model. When we are told that market timing is a bad idea or that stocks are always best for the long run, or that you can't beat the market, that's all Buy-and-Hold thinking evidencing itself. If price changes are often rooted in irrationality, it makes all the sense in the world to change your stock allocation when stocks are insanely overpriced since the irrational mispricing will be correcting itself in days to come. However, if stock prices are indeed set rationally, market timing is a mistake.  Rob ",
