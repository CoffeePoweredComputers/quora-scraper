            "answer_text": "An Exciter, as other answers have said, adds some harmonics\u2026 even if they\u2019re not present in the original recording. And that last bit is important. If you recorded something and it sounds dull, no amount of boosting high end with EQ will help, because EQ can only boost or cut frequencies that exist. If it isn\u2019t there, you can\u2019t magically make it be there no matter how much EQ you add. Exciters come to your rescue. They add missing harmonics artificially\u2026 and then you can use EQ to make them sweet if you really want to get picky. It\u2019s easy to see with a sine wave \u2026 I made one on a Moog, playing an A at 440Hz. Then, I passed the output through an Exciter and turned the Harmonic control up and down to create harmonics. In this case, the Exciter is creating the third harmonic at 1320Hz - which is actually what you want, because adding the second harmonic at 880Hz would just be the same as using an octave doubler. There\u2019s a tiny amount of second harmonic creeping in if you look closely though. Here\u2019s the video \u2026 the centre line of the Channel EQ plugin window shows the frequency of the waveform peaks. The main peak is at 440Hz, and the peak at 1320Hz comes and goes as I adjust the plugin setting. Note that this plugin robs some of the power of the main frequency as it gets turned up. The extra high frequency energy has to come from somewhere\u2026  It\u2019s subtle on this sine wave. If you turn it up to max on something with lots of mixed frequency content - a vocal for example, it can get really quite uncomfortable. As with everything, it\u2019s best used in tiny amounts. We should always get close to the perfect sound up front, and use plugins to refine, not repair. ",
