            "answer_text": "I have a lot of opinion (some are not unpopular) regarding this concert both good and bad. I watched both days so\u2026 I think this is going to be a long opinion for me. Or short. Or medium? Whatever it may be, please don\u2019t be offended by some of my opinions. I\u2019ll highlight some of the unpopular to stick with the question. So I\u2019ll start with the setlist. I actually bought both tickets expecting it with different setlist because it\u2019s a \u201ctwo-day concert\u201d. But boy, I was wrong. When I watched Day 2, I first thought there was a replay? Day 1 aired on 6 PM (PH TIME) while Day 2 started at 4 PM (a little early for a typical concert). So I waited, still thinking that there\u2019s a Day 1 replay on Day 2 because the outfits in the opening performance were the same, the VCR and all that. Then I noticed some things changed so I made a sigh of relief. But my opinion on the setlist: they should\u2019ve changed it or shuffle it anyhow. For me, I think I expected a new and fresh setlist in Day 2 because it\u2019s a chance for BTS to show more of their songs. They don\u2019t get to have a lot of concerts this year so might as well change it up, right? Let their new strategy shine bright. So, the setlist was kind of disappointing for me. Another comment on the setlist, why would they place it in this order: My Time Filter Moon Inner Child In my opinion, they should\u2019ve placed it in THIS order: Moon My Time Inner Child Filter I am going to admit, after Filter, it got dull after the next solo because it became a slow song. They should\u2019ve balanced that out! Like after 00:00, they should\u2019ve put Moon because the transition fits more. Moon performance is really cute, referencing The Little Prince, little foxes dancing, and Jin hugging the Earth. It is like a fairytale. But it can\u2019t sit next to Filter because Jimin\u2019s performance outshines everything else. Next is the performance, which is really good! Although there are few mistakes (Jimin\u2019s delayed dance step in D-2 Filter performance) and accidents (someone hitting Yoongi in the D-1 performance of Shadow), it is obvious that they are such professional artists and the show must go on. But I understand why they prefer to keep the setlist the same so that they wouldn\u2019t go practicing other dance steps which is tiring. The solo performances are great! I\u2019m glad this concert gave them the chance to perform it. Let\u2019s break it down: RM\u2019s Persona is classic and the dancers delayed steps, which defines them as the \u201cpeople who copy\u201d RM\u2019s techniques. I\u2019m glad that after this they performed Boy in Luv because it both gives us school look vibes. I love it.  Suga\u2019s Shadow is impressive. I got kind of scared because of the hands behind him and the flashing red lights (triggers?) but it\u2019s cool. His performance really highlights the \u201cshadow\u201d lurking around him. Then he changed into his shadow, letting it control him. I\u2019ll give this a 10/10.  Jungkook\u2019s My Time is really sexy and satisfying to watch. Jungkook dancing while singing is a hard thing to do. Thank goodness he has great stamina. But the dance break in My Time is unnecessary, I think. And an Easter egg in the ending: JK and his dancers formed into a 6:13 time in the clock.  Jimin\u2019s Filter was the highlight of the concert! I love the choreography (thank you, Nicky Andersen), outfit, and his seductive voice. The outfit changes was clever. I\u2019ll never stop watching both performance, especially the D-1 red velvet outfit. I won\u2019t forget this dance step:  Jin\u2019s Moon is really cute. A fit for all ages, especially for young ARMYs. Though my dad didn\u2019t like it that much (he\u2019s very impressed with Jimin\u2019s performance, please don\u2019t attack him), I told him that Jin\u2019s song is very meaningful. Referencing The Little Prince, Jin\u2019s the prince and the moon watching earth from afar. I love it, love it, love it! Jin\u2019s aegyo bursting in this performance. The scene where Jin hugged the earth is so cute!!!  Taehyung\u2019s Inner Child is also cute and wonderful. Featuring the child, who looks just like Taehyung, they are riding a carousel and looking at each other and Taehyung singing at him, maybe talking to his old self. But this performance lacks something (sorry). I expected more than just Taehyung and the kid riding the carousel. Though the ARMY singing \u201cWe gon\u2019 change\u201d made up for it. So beautiful and heartwarming as ARMYs are always there for V whenever he\u2019s sad.  J-Hope\u2019s Ego is also a great performance, reminding me of his music video Chicken Noodle Soup. His hip-hop outfit, his \u201ccrew\u201d, and his \u201cmembers\u201d\u2014who appeared at the end dancing with him\u2014as his ego. This is such a very jolly performance and J-Hope\u2019s dance steps is worth learning while dancing to this tune.  The rap line and vocal line performance is perfect for me. \u2018Nuff said. However, the performance as a whole is great! Same old BTS dancing their hearts out to their hit songs. The dance breaks wowed me, too. The remix of Dionysus is great. BigHit, please release it on music platforms. We\u2019ll be gladly to stream it. Some expectations is that I thought they would perform some of their MOTS:7 songs that they performed at BANGBANGCON (such as Friends, Jamais Vu, etc.) but sadly it didn\u2019t make the cut :( And also\u2026why did they leave out Louder than Bombs?? Third is the price. And for me, it\u2019s pretty affordable. And you can choose both days or each. But compared to BANGBANGCON, there\u2019s no difference. Fourth is the outfit and hairstyles. Their stylists are pretty great and their undercuts though. I suppose this is not unpopular but holy moly! Just look at their hair and outfits. I would like to thank all the (hair)stylist noonas for these looks.        Feeling blessed. The fifth is the setting and presentation. For me, I prefer BANGBANGCON\u2019s setting/vibe more than Map of the Soul ON:E as an online concert. The CGI here in ON:E is really good but the screen distortion behind them sometimes bother me. It\u2019s like performing in a music show. This is BANGBANGCON:   This is Map of the Soul ON:E:   Though the boulder, seeing ARMY, and CGI is impressive but nah, I still prefer a realer setting more than the CGI.  I think I will prefer watching the MOTS ON:E in person because the screen behind them won\u2019t distort. And this venue is pretty great for a live concert:  But unfortunately, due to a pandemic, they just made it online. Who knew the pandemic would last this long? So that pretty much sums it up. If you don\u2019t agree on my opinion, we can talk about it in the comments in a nice way :) If you have more opinions, you can also comment. Here\u2019s a pretty cool CGI while they\u2019re singing We Are Bulletproof: The Eternal  And a cute Hobi sending you hearts.  ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if this is an unpopular opinion. Mainly because I have no idea what anyone\u2019s opinion is about the concert really. I guess an odd thing I want to say about it is, I\u2019ve never experienced a concert where I felt both elated and heartbroken. That probably doesn\u2019t make much sense. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the concert was absolutely amazing. I loved finally being able to see, even if it wasn\u2019t in person, the songs we\u2019ve never gotten to see performed. Seeing the new choreography, the older songs, the stage outfits, just the way they decided to present everything, I was not disappointed in the slightest. So, overall I was elated. Finally being able to see them perform again. Seeing that sparkle in their eyes where they are able to do what they love. It was like a breath of fresh air returning after being locked away in the dark for so long. So where does the heart breaking part come in? Well in different aspects. It always kind of breaks my heart when I see them perform knowing there\u2019s no audience actually there. Because even though me as a viewer, I get to experience a very similar concert experience on my end, I know that\u2019s not true for them. They are making the best of a shitty situation. But it\u2019s still a shitty situation. I know they must want to perform for fans in person. So badly. And knowing that they can\u2019t right now is sad. Hearing an artificial track of fans screaming and cheering is not the same. Then there\u2019s just some performances that personally made me misty eyed. Like Inner Child. I knew it was going to happen. I knew that if I was to ever see that song performed, it was over for me. I was not disappointed. The addition of a miniature Taehyung look-alike, completed the recipe for my bawling. Do I need to speak about We are Bulletproof the Eternal? I don\u2019t think I do. Oof. Tissues. Needed lots of tissues. And then the final nail in my heart break coffin, was Jimin\u2019s ending speech. When he broke down, I felt my heart shatter for him. He really tried to hold it together, but ultimately the tears won. And I truly felt it wasn\u2019t a typical emotional ending cry. This cry felt deep. It felt raw. It was a lot of pent-up emotions that just came to a boil. It\u2019s that body shaking, hard to catch your breath, face scrunching up, lip quivering beyond your control type of cry. Typically, I would say it\u2019s the ugly cry. But, Jimin is not capable of an ugly cry. But sometimes the cry feels ugly, because boy does it hurt. So that\u2019s my opinion, unpopular or not. It was an amazing show. Performed by seven amazing individuals. But it really does say a lot for them as performers\u2026.. they\u2019re so powerful they\u2019re able to make you both overwhelmingly ecstatic and devastatingly broken all within a span of a few hours.
