            "answer_text": "The tuning of the guitar from its standard tuning (EADGBE) changes the notes played when the strings are open, that is not being held down at any fret. When you change the tuning of a guitar, such as to a drop-D tuning (DADGBE), the location of the notes will change. So, in this example, to play a \u201cG\u201d on the sixth or bottom string in standard tuning you would hold the string down at the 3rd fret; in drop-D tuning, you would have to push down on the 5th fret to get the same note because you had lowered the sixth string from E to D. This will affect how you create chords and play scales. Depending upon how different the alternate tuning is from standard tuning, the usual chord shapes or scale patterns will likely no longer produce the same sound that they did in standard tuning. Thus, one benefit of playing in an alternate tuning is that it forces you to put aside the familiar chords and guitar licks and discover something new. Alternate tunings can give you a sound unlike that available in standard tuning. This might be because a different open note is available or because some of the open strings are doubled. For example, the popular alternate tuning DADGAD has three \u201cD\u201d notes and two \u201cA\u201d notes that will ring open at different octaves. This gives a unique sound to the tuning. Another form of alternate tuning is to tune the guitar to the sound of a chord, such as an open-G (DGDGBD).  By holding down all of the strings (called a barre) at different frets, you can play a different chord.  You can also let some of the open strings ring out while you play on the other strings. These are common technique used in slide guitar or Hawaiian slack-key guitar. The biggest downside of using alternate tunings is that you either need to have more than one guitar available (and pre-tuned) or you need to become adept at quickly changing your guitar\u2019s tuning. Sonic Youth, for example, would take dozens of guitars on tour with them. Those of us that can\u2019t afford such luxuries learn to play at least a couple of songs in each alternate tuning so as to minimize time spent tuning before a live audience. ",

            "answer_text": "Very briefly, the technical playing of the instrument is the same regardless of how its tuned. You pick and fret the notes in the same way, create harmonics in the same way, etc. What changes are the scale/chord shapes and the notes you get on open strings. Why would you want to use alternative tunings? Most common reasons: -Access notes you otherwise couldn\u2019t. For example \u201cDrop D\u201d (DADGBe) tuning gives you access to a low D notes that you simply can\u2019t play in standard (EADGBe) tuning. -Make certain things easier to play. Again, using drop D as an example, having that low D note lets you use it as an open D bass note for songs in the key of D. This is pretty common for open tunings. . having an open string tuned to the song root note to access it. -Open chord tunings let you use open strings for certain songs, and also access harmonics in key that otherwise might not be. Open chord tunings also let you get adjacent string chord intervals that are especially useful for slide guitar. So most slide guitarists play in open E (or open D) or open G. They can also just simplify rhythm playing. Barre chords take one finger, and you can easily put extensions on them with few additional ones. Keith Richards uses open G tuning for a lot of Rolling Stones songs, as an example of this kind of playing. -Emulate sound of non guitar instruments. If you want to play lute pieces on your guitar, for example, you may find fingerings easier and more \u201csensible\u201d with the instrument tuned like a lute (EADF#Be). You could use a fifths based tuning for cello/mandolin type things, etc. ",
