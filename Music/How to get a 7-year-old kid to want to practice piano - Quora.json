            "answer_text": "Really, you don't have to do anything except make sure she enjoys playing the piano.  If she does not enjoy the weekly lessons or the \"assigned\" pieces, then you are in for a long hard battle and she's only 7. Her attitude seems entirely appropriate at age 7.   Here's what worked for us (YMMV).  We've always had a piano and my daughter showed a small amount of interest.  However, instead of piano lessons we instead took advantage of enrolling her in an excellent children's choir with three outstanding choir directors.  They really asked a lot of the kids, and taught them excellent musicianship and technique.  (That was just luck.)  She was 8 when she started.  In the next two years our daughter got a wonderful musical education using the easiest instrument imaginable: her voice!  She performed at festivals and the choir sounded great.  She loved her teachers.  It was a magical experience for her.  Sadly the choir folded after two years and we couldn't find another one close by. Time passes.  Music happens (or not) without lessons. Then a bit of clarinet in the school band and short-lived love affair with the saxophone.  When she was 13 she again expressed interest and this time we did find a very simpatico piano teacher. She's been having lessons for exactly one year now, and her teacher says she's advanced as much as other kids in three years.  She is starting Grade 4 pieces now.  (I'm sorry to brag about that.)   My point is, they can also learn piano when they are older, and they will learn faster. They will have more control of their fingers, they will have more experience learning things, and they will be interested because it is something they want, not what you want. I can't tell you how glad I am that we did not start piano lessons when she was 6. We did have to suffer watching all the accomplished cousins show off their skills, but guess what?  The cousins have now quit playing.  We are enjoying a house full of music.  She plays her own compositions more than her assigned pieces but who in their right mind is going to complain about that?

            "answer_text": "I think the key thing is that it  should be fun for the most part for your daughter (like 80% fun, 20%  \"discipline\").  Kids are usually not too motivated by money or stuff  actually, they don't need to paid anything to play all day or imagine or  laugh or do crazy things.  So I'd focus on making it fun &  interesting -- but also she should have a bit of discipline about  practice and getting her work done and as a parent you have to impart  that.   Here are a few specific suggestions.   1.  Pop  Music Sheet Music.  For playing sheet music and weekly lessons, maybe  try pop music instead of classical music.  Stuff by the Beatles,  Coldplay, etc.  I personally *love* classical music so it pains me to  recommend this, but I've seen many kids start playing pop music on the  piano and stop needing any push to practice.   2.  Transcribe by ear.  If she has a good ear, have her listen to pieces and start playing them and transcribe them perhaps?!   3.   Composition / Theory.  If she likes making up her own tunes, maybe  incorporate music theory into her lessons and have her do a composition  every week that incorporates that lesson.  So one week, she'll learn  what a major scale is and write a tune in that.  Then in minor.  Then  she can learn what major and minor chords are, harmony, etc.  There are  many, many music composition books out there and every week as she  learns a new concept, she can incorporate that into a new composition.

            "answer_text": "I have found that children that age have already been exposed to too many instant gratification distractions such as cell phones, tablets, computers, games, cable TV and the internet. They have been conditioned that they don\u2019t need to invest much time to achieve instant results and banal satisfaction. So, when they sit at a piano which requires intense, strict and focused attention and discipline, they get bored easily. I\u2019d start by removing all distractions but, most likely, her brain is already wired. (I don\u2019t know why I presume your child is of feminine gender.) I have a friend who removed all those distractions from his house when they had their first daughter and they home schooled her. The TV was used only for showing carefully selected movies and documentaries and never used as a baby sitter. Movie time was a family event. She grew up to enjoy learning and focused hard work. Today she is a genius in college though, has trouble finding a BF because she finds boys her age to be so immature, unfocused and uncultured. She has already professionally modeled, acted, traveled to Europe several times, is a great chef and has learned the fine art of mixing drinks (though not of legal drinking age yet). She is putting herself through college as a bartender for the insouciants and swells of Manhattan. So, remove all distractions if it is not too late. All children love to learn and instead of trying to trick them into playing the piano, teach them to love hard work and persistence, not mindless indulgence. Maybe they will take it to the piano. ",

            "answer_text": "As a kid who had started learning piano at age 5, I can attest the strength of my parents' methods - albeit, I don't believe they had a major plan set up, it just worked out. First off, my mom was always playing piano when I was very very little. And she always had me with her; therefore I easily associated her with the piano and wanted to be like her as a little kid. Around 4, I would climb onto the bench and make sounds come out of it, but when I would try to play, my mom forbid me to touch it. In reality, she didn't want me to possibly break it (it was an exceptionally old piano) and I had cut my finger on a sharp side edge once so she didn't want me to get hurt. Regardless of the reasons, I wanted to play it more than anything because it was now forbidden. After literally a year of routinely begging my mom to let me play, she started teaching me. She taught me songs I knew and already loved and therefore wanted to learn. At around 7 I started with structured lessons from a different teacher other than her. My teacher was very laid back - never pushed me, to asked me to practice. And although I practiced a lot for my age, I definitely went through phases where I didn't want to do anything. One summer I stopped lessons all together and then resumed in the fall. I think for me the laid back attitude allowed me to self-motivate and even though I went through a couple of those phases, I always came back to loving it.  I've been playing now for 17 years since my mom started teaching me at 5. I was classically trained and then in high school did jazz band. I've played professionally in orchestra pits, for various local affairs like store openings, malls and such, and conducted a local high school's orchestra for the production of the Sound of Music. And for the last three years, I've taught elementary and middle school aged students beginning and intermediate piano. It's a huge part of my life. When I'm upset, scared, angry, hurt etc, I play piano. It's my way of yelling. And when I play I get lost in the music and forget what is around me. It is also my alcohol/drug. I wouldn't be able to deal with so much in my life as well as I do if it weren't for the piano. It was such a huge part of me that when I moved to another state for university, I couldn't stay in a dorm, because I needed to have a piano on hand at all times, whcih required an apartment., For me, the laissez-faire style definitely worked.  But, that is just me. If your 7 year old likes the piano, playing with the sounds and tunes, then she is on the right track and may definitely come around to loving it more and more once she realizes she may need to learn how to do something less exciting to play something more exciting. I wouldn't neccessarily worry about her not practicing her weekly lessons at the moment and instead see if she gradually starts to connect or disconnect more with the instrument. If she starts to disconnect, I'd simply keep encouraging her to play songs she likes. I'd ask her why she likes the songs she does and try to find other ones like them to try to expand upon. If she likes picking out her own tunes, skip directly to the composition lessons (which will subtly teach theory) and she will most likely turn to re-learning the classical songs that would train her better and give her more to work from.  Regardless, I definitely don't think you have to worry about this quite yet - she seems interested in learning the instrument, just not at the speed in which you were aiming, but she may come around soon.

            "answer_text": "You know, I was this way.   I liked music.  i even enjoyed the expression of my violin.  But the old school way of teaching music, where I was expected to practice an hour a day like clockwork and play in the school orchestra just bored, irritated me. The end result was, as soon as I hit college, I put my violin away and haven't touched it for 25 years.  On the other hand, in college I picked up the harmonica and just started learning to improve and I still pick it up when Im in the mood.  I also learned as an adult that I could sing and taught myself enough guitar to center my voice and i get great satisfaction out of it. My brother, noodled around with various instruments, never stuck with any of them long, and ended up not just singing but running the Clearwater Coffee house in New York for a numerb of years,  He still sings in a folk-circle regularly. Moral of the story?  I don't think children leaner anything by the old school, rigid and forced way of learning music.  Expose them to music, let them try it in various ways, have it in their environment, but let THEM decide what they want to do with it. They will, in the end, anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "There is some question here. At age 6 a child can have a lot of interest already. I mean, think about his brain. He had been being wired for years about this and that, etc. At this age he has already a lot of things in his brain. I am assuming that he had not yet started to play the piano at age 6. OK? To make a child to love to play the piano, you have to create an artificial environment that do not exist to make the child get extremely interested in playing the piano. Most of the good pianist start around age 2 or 3. He would be sort of 3 or 4 years in retard. But even then it is possible to create an artificial environment for that purpose of making the boy to love play the piano. The first thing you must consider is that a child do things because they have pleasant consequences. He had received a lot in praises for talking well, for knowing a little of some foreign language, for having good grades at school, etc. a) Just imagine the child already knows to play the piano a little, but you want him to work more with the piano. or b) The child never had play the piano before. You bought the piano last week. The solution in both cases is the same. The child is not going to play the piano unless he would learn that to play the piano is full of pleasant consequences. But even in the case a) where the child already can play the piano a little, you think he does not play enough. You want him to work more time. In both cases, a) and b), you must be involved in such a manner, that you must be as slave as the child would be playing the piano, for you must be praising him constantly for being playing. It does not mind at all if he does it better or worse, you must be almost constantly praising him for what he is doing. Then, for the thing to work properly, you must understand that a piece that last a minute to play it, is too long for a child to be praised. Then, you must divide the piece is much smaller fragments not lasting more than 5 or 10 seconds. Of course if a child have so little training that cannot play any fragment lasting 60 seconds, you have it clear. You must present him a shorter goal, a smaller fragment that takes only a few seconds, or less. If a child have not any experience it would take a while he would not be able to play six consecutive notes. So you must work a lot with these problem making him to be able to remember short chains of notes. Between 3 and 5 notes; later a little longer. Then a piece of minute requires the child would learn the thing in shorter fragments. And each short fragment requires to shower the child with praises, to make the play pleasant. A child that never was encouraged or praised for having a lot of language he would be short with words. And someone would think he is a little dull. But the only reason he speaks so little is that his parents had not encouraged this kid to speak more. Then he can look a little like mute. The same occur with the piano. Most of us, never had been praised for playing the piano and we do not have a piano at home. You can figure. We are the equivalent to a mute in regard to play the piano. But I said, a little before that, that you must be as slave as the child would be playing the piano, for you must be praising him constantly for being playing. Then, it does not work if you put the child to play something and you leave. If you leave the child would stop playing in less than 20 seconds. Why? Because the source of praises it is you. If you are not close to him, the child knows you are not going to praise him, and the game of playing the piano becomes stupid. The only reason for the child to play the piano is because you are praising him. But by praising quite often the behavior of the child is changing slowly. What happens? It is becoming \u201cpleasant conditioned\u201d. What this mean? A behavior that is a natural bore had changed its nature and had become pleasant. Here it comes that You must be the agent mediator to change a boring and tiresome of behavior into a pleasant one. There is another question. The child have other behaviors. You must become a little stingy with the older behaviors and increase the praises for the new behavior you had targeted: to play the piano. There is another question, whatever you are or your children are, time is precious and limited. A child cannot have time for everything, and not even you. Thus you or your child cannot learn everything except rather badly. So, a child with many different abilities would not impress anyone with an intelligence. He, you, everybody, can know a few things right - and deeply. So, you cannot know well more than a couple of matters, or perhaps three different ones, but it would had taken you a lot of time and work to master the damn questions. Nothing comes to you brain because a god put those abilities inside. It is the result of an objective work of training. Intelligence is the result of some training. I had had often disputes about this idea. I can try to argument this question again. But a training does not tell us much. A training is not other than a concept. It can be good, very good, average, bad or very bad. If you have not the means to check this out, you would not never know if your child is having a very good training or a bad one. Remember that our natural pleasures are to eat when we are hungry or to drink water if we have thirsty. Among adults, sex can be also a pleasant behavior. No so rare. But the rest of the behavior is only good or bad by its pleasant consequences. Then the reply is simply. To make your child to love to play the piano, you need to make this behavior \u201cpleasant conditioned\u201d. Or in plain English, you must do something to make that your child would be very happy playing the piano. To play the piano is one of the most tiresome and boring behavior unless it has been conditioned so well as to become a great pleasure. Final note: I am not sure if anyone reading this post had understood what I said. But I want to be proud that my posts are easily understood. If someone see something faulty or incomprehensible here, do not hesitate to ask for clarifications. I would be pleased if everybody understand what I said. Thus any problems someone would have reading is I would be pleased to know to mend it. I had avoided as much as possible the use of jargon. ",

            "answer_text": "My wife and I struggle with this too. We remain concerned that while reward system mechanics were handy in the beginning, at some point each child needs to intrinsically want to keep practicing piano (or hockey or soccer for that matter) to make the experience worthwhile for everyone. As Byron Henry notes, it's probably best to take whatever little wins you can get until they twig onto the idea that piano practice is a structured chance to do something enjoyable for its own sake. It may never happen, but it's probably better than the alternatives. It also depends on your child's personality I suppose. Our eldest enjoys a sense of mastery and accomplishment, but needed a reward system to get a year into playing the instrument. Practice is still not turn-key, but there is definitely some acknowledgement that it is necessary and that the piano is a worthwhile commitment. We've almost entirely phased out the reward system now. I can only hope the little one follows the same progression and has a similar temperament. Please keep in mind, we probably aren't a prodigy family that's going ot produce a musical prodigy. :D Our expectations are that the kids take the instrument seriously and do the best they can, but we're not expecting them to headline recitals either (unless of course they make a big leap... and then it's on :).

            "answer_text": "It sounds like she doesn't like the stuff she's doing in the lesson, but likes the piano, so your problem isn't the piano, or her interest in playing really-it's what she has to do in the lesson. I don't know if you play, but if you don't, I will tell you as a classical pianist that the exercises she is doing are an integral part of  learning how to play the piano with skill and proper technique. And hey, I will not lie to you, they are B-O-R-I-N-G. Scales and arpeggios, and practicing how to read music ain't exciting. She wants to make music (which is why she's making up her own tunes and trying to play by ear). And scales and other exercises aren't music. But they are necessary for her in order for her to develop the dexterity she will need to play well. So, perhaps you could do this: 1) Explain to her that you know she is bored with the lessons, specifically the scales, but the teacher assigns those lessons so that she will be able to play the piano well. If she doesn't learn how to do her lesson, she will not be able to play music, and she will be frustrated when she tries to play harder music later on. 2) Segment her practice time. I don't know how long you have her practicing, but based on her age, I'd guess she probably spends maybe 30 minutes practicing.  Instead of making her do nothing but the lesson at her practice session, tell her that she will have to spend, say, 15 minutes on the lesson, and then she can pick out her tunes and play by ear for the rest of the practice session.  Hear me on this, and I am speaking as both a pianist and a singer: She is not wasting her time doing what she is doing. What she is doing on her own is also essential. She is training her ear, and that is IMPORTANT. She is working on learning how to compose music. She is sharpening her ability to hear music and reproduce it. If she decides to write her own music, or wants to sing, or wants to engage in music that requires improvisation (e.g., jazz) these skills are important. You definitely want to build time into the lesson for her to do what she is doing.  3) If you have not done so already, talk to her teacher. Ask her if she has noticed that your little girl can play by ear, and likes to make up tunes. If the teacher hasn't been aware of that, then this will enable the teacher to tailor the lesson so that there is time for her to sharpen these budding skills, and in turn, make the lesson more interesting for her.  These things might help to get her more interested in the \"nuts and bolts\" of learning, and make her more willing to practice the boring, but oh-so-important stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt you can get her to \"want to practice.\" For some kids, it is like getting them to \"want to do chores.\" It's fruitless. So, you will need to muster your parental finesse and explain to her she must practice 30-minutes per day, no discussion. It's just something she needs to do, like brushing her teeth.  Initially, I suggest you be present during practice sessions. This way she's not alone, and she knows you're actively interested and listening to her music. You can express joy. Praise tunes. Even reinforce lesson material. Expect lots of squirming and shuffling of materials. Expect complaints and expostulations like \"I'm done!\" after 20 minutes. But consider it your job to keep her on task. If, after 6 months, you are still having to enforce practice sessions, reconsider the lessons. She may not be ready or, despite her facility, she may not be cut out to be a piano player.  I recommend this question on Quora: Is it a good idea to force a child to take music lessons when they don\u2019t want to?. ",

My best advice is to give rewards for practicing, and also a lot of praise for practicing. Make it so they want the reward and the praise as much as they want the fun time making up their own songs. Practicing does not have to take very long either. Five to ten minutes daily at that age is plenty. Lastly, take them to hear other people playing piano occasionally so it will inspire them to emulate that. Don't be discouraged if this doesn't work right away, as long as you keep them playing a little bit, you have succeeded. ",

When they associate good, positive times on the piano, that will lead them to practice more serious things and really study. I have also brought out the carton of toys with the kids to motivate them. We put stickers on the piano and recorded the sounds that Godzilla would make if he were playing piano. Start with very short practice periods, maybe even 5 minutes at a time. Stay consistent and slowly build this up to longer time periods. Again, the point is to create a sense of interest and happiness playing the piano instead of dread. If things really get discouraging, maybe have them change to guitar or another instrument so that they remain interested and excited about music. Hope this helps ",

Even young kids don't think 5 minutes is very long.

I'd start by boiling down (way down) some melodies from songs your kid likes, something familiar and fun. If you could perhaps set up an occasion where your kid gets to show off in front of a friend, that's even better. Get some videos of virtuosic performances, you get the idea.  Then! When they plateau, when they get more curious and they're already comfortable on a piano, you can start with technique. It sounds like cheating, and part of me is just doing this to play Devil's advocate, but I think once they believe \"piano can be fun\" they'll understand the need to practice. ",

I create a flyer with their name in fancy letters with stars and smiley faces. Then I list five easy songs and give them a timeline to learn them. Two -four weeks. At the end, I write a check mark on the sheet along with the date they played the song. I give them a game if they can play all the songs perfectly. This will require them to work on the songs every day to complete the task and win the prize. Makesure the gift is something they really want. One child that I used this with asked for another sheet after she completed the first one. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How can I motivate my 6-year old child to practice piano? Having played keyboard/piano a bit when in college, i wish i would have played when i was younger. Let your child know the importance and advantages playing at their age offers. Tell them the tremendous advantage they have by learning and participating in music, especially the difficulty of piano, at an early age and in society/economics and continuing that development. Let them know it is like riding a bicycle, once they learn it they will have it for life. My youngest daughter started with the piano about kindergarten, and now as a sophomore in High School plays/owns 6 percussion instruments, violin, and most recently learned/bought alto sax. It all started with the piano\u2026and dad\u2019s encouragement and hearing music played in the home is awesome\u2026 as i always felt i missed out on much musically. Impress that on them somehow; that if they don\u2019t play/learn, they may feel the same when they get older. Let them know that doing/practicing half heartedly is a \u2018loosing\u2019 mentality: if you are going to do it, do your best. Are they practicing at their best?; its an honor thing, and they have to understand/buy into that. Like sports, the practice/hard work principles are life/character lessons, not just piano lessons. Then there is the \u2018get r done\u2019 way  Haha, nothing motivates a kid like a little attitude adjustment. But the long term results are not in favor of such. It pits you against them. It works until they are about 9\u201310 when they will resent/hate it instead of being in fear and motivated by it. It is strictly a solve the issue quickly and effectively for the instant parenting choice. For most parents, corporal control is not an option, and their dysfunction/failures shows some correlations. I use both, corporal very sparingly, and have graduated a valedictorian, a couple All States and much more to be proud of. My suggestion in these regards, speak softly but carry a mean stick, and don\u2019t be afraid to do what is right/effective as a good parent. Too many families have the tail wagging the dog\u2026 remember: \u2018you da dog\u2019. Many children grow up to appreciate the discipline the \u2018harder\u2019 parent had with them; but that usually relates to keeping them from troubles not helping them do good in an activity. And in a way, that is what piano practice/playing is about. Filling/parenting their time with constructive activities so to keep them from the destructive activities or mediocrity. I have never seen a kid while practicing piano getting into trouble. Well, unless you\u2019d count my daughter refusing to play my favorites on piano, she knows how to get under my skin\u2026 douG ",

My wife and I take the attitude with our son that it's the price of wanting to keep playing piano (he loves his lessons and actually has enjoyed his recitals).  Since taking that perspective, the fighting turned to prodding, which turned to hearing him at the piano without prompting.  Someday it might turn to enjoying practice, but as long as he enjoys playing, anything else is gravy. ",

If the latter, then it doesn't really matter what she wants, you just enforce what she's doing with external rewards and punishments, like no friends/video games/dessert until the practicing is done or better yet, until the piece is played correctly.

            "answer_text": "I'm of the opinion that more people would stay with piano if they were able to dive into familiar material of their own liking earlier in the lesson process.  Many instructors choose to stay inside the lines with regards to piano method, technique etc...   I had 5 yrs. of formal training as a youth (at my own request) but fortunately had an instructor that encouraged exploration of music styles of my own choosing along with a smattering of the classics.  Ultimately I quit lessons as the formal material couldn't keep my interest.   After a short period of months I found myself back at the piano composing, arranging, searching out more varying styles to stretch my musical palate.  Taught myself to play by ear, read scratch charts and tab, along with familiarity with synthesizers and recording gear.  I still spend way more time on the music gear around the house than my children.   No amount of $$ spent on lessons will drive them to love playing as much as I do.  They have access to all of my gear and know that I am open at any time to help them find what they choose to do in their heart. ",

If she is under 8, I would recommend sitting with her at least a few times a week and guide her through practice time and keep her on task. For a mini incentive, place 5 smarties or chocolate chips or other small treat at one end of the piano. For each repetition of a scale or piece, she moves one treat to the other side. When done she can eat the treat. You can try something similar with Lego or a puzzle- for each repititon add a piece to the Lego creation or puzzle. Sometimes it is just a matter of seeing these small successes that you can build on, then the student can see their own progress thru consistent practice. ",
