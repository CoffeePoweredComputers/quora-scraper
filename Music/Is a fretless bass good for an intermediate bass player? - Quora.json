            "answer_text": "Go for it, why not? What will help your transition greatly is consistent fingering on the fretted. Also, get into the habit of fretting right before the fret. The muscle memory of cause carries over! Some tips for intonation and the transition: once in a while put a drone onpractice with a tuner and spot check some notespractice jumps; here is an exercise borrowed from upright players that is great for intonation: Talking Technique: Jumps Without Looking at the FretboardAs for lines: they do help. Main reason: dots on a fretted are usually in between frets, on a fretless without lines they are where the fret would be. Hence, lines help a little because they make the neck look more familiar. That said, they are but a guide. The ears are still the ultimate compass. Distances are so close together that even if you are on the line and it \u201clooks\u201d right it may not necessarily sound right. But, again, it does help make the neck look more familiar. Also, you can shape the sound so many ways on the fretless - with vibrato and swells etc - that is done by moving the finger in subtle ways, encircling the spot on the line. You love the sound and are inspired. Go for it! Enjoy those yummy sounds! ",

            "answer_text": "I tend to discourage it, but it won\u2019t hurt you - it will just distract you from working on your fundamentals, in my opinion. If you DO decide to get a fretless, get an unlined one. Lines on fretless basses often are confusing. You need to accept that you will sound BAD at first. As in really bad. But that\u2019s okay - you have to work at it. Play scales, play melodies and just sound bad - until you don\u2019t. Your fingers will sync up with your ears and, with work, your intonation will get good. But don\u2019t bother looking at the neck, just PLAY. Let your body figure it out. It will. ",
