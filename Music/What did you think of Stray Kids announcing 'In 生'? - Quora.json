Every song and album they produce radiates a vibe; a vibe that only the Stray Kids can radiate. You can tell that they put in their absolute best in every lyric and beat. I love the hairstyles (not Chan\u2019s because he slightly resembles Ronald McDonald, whom I\u2019m not too fond of) and the trailer; without a doubt, they\u2019ve surpassed my expectations once again. I really hope they\u2019re not overworking themselves as they\u2019re planning so many comebacks in a year (Blackpink can\u2019t relate, fuck you YG). STAYs, because Stray Kids are working so hard to spoil us with content, let\u2019s also try our best to stream and vote for them! While you\u2019re here, stream God\u2019s Menu:  ",
