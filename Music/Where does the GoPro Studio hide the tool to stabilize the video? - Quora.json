            "answer_text": "GoPro Fusion Studio app does not feature stabilizing video. If you are using Hero 5 or 6, you can turn on the in-camera stabilization when taking some action motion. GoPro in-camera video stabilization is actually a combination of both lense and digital image stabilization. With video stabilization option turned on on GoPro, any blur or distorted picture caused by camera shaking will be real-time smoothed out on camera. The image processor, say GoPro GP1, flexibly crops images round the edge and zooms images in, losing about 5%~10% of the image in total. Unfortunately, not all GoPro Hero machines get benefit from this stabilization feature, because GoPro has added it into Hero5 firstly and improved its performance on Hero6. If you want to stabilize your GoPro shaky video on Windows PC, you are suggested to turn to VideoProc (with the least cropping and quality loss), FFMPEG, Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, or Windows Movie Maker (only for Windows 7 or earlier) . At last you should know that the best way to deshake video is to stabilize camera as much as possible during filming process. So mechanical stabilization is the perfect way to go. Believe it or not, no matter you mount GoPro by using head and chest mount, or choose a gimbal grip stabilizer, it will be quite helpful for capturing steady video. Of course if you still get unstable video with all anti-shake preperation works done, you have to seek help for video editor for post production. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking about hardware stabilization inside GoPro, as far as I know, there is none. The stabilization only happens in the software. It's not easy to physically stabilize the footage, and for existing examples you can look some Sony Camcorders (where you can see their lens move) and Olympus cameras, with the 5 axis stabilization, where you can you take off the lens and see the sensor move. The body of GoPro is too small, and its purpose doesn't really justify the extra cost of stabilization. ",
