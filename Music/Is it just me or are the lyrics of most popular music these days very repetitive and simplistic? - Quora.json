            "answer_text": "No, it's not just you. And it's not just the lyrics of most popular music these days; it's the lyrics of most popular music on a general basis. Because, for popular music to be exactly that, it needs to somehow pander to a comparatively low common denominator. This is not exactly achieved by harmonizing the sonnets of Shakespeare, you know? Here, check this out. This had the Billboard #1 spot for four weeks during the fall of 1963: Ooh baby love, my baby loveI need you, oh how I need youBut all you do is treat me badBreak my heart and leave me sadTell me, what did I do wrongTo make you stay away so long 'Cause baby love, my baby loveBeen missing ya, miss kissing yaInstead of breaking upLet's do some kissing and making upDon't throw our love awayIn my arms, why don't you stay? Need ya, need yaBaby love, ooh, baby love Baby love, my baby loveWhy must we seperate, my loveAll of my whole life throughI never loved no one but youWhy you do me like you do?I get this need Ooh, ooh, need to hold youOnce again, my loveFeel your warm embrace, my loveDon't throw our love awayPlease don't do me this wayNot happy like I used to beLoneliness has got the best of me My love, my baby loveI need you, oh how I need youWhy you do me like you doAfter I've been true to youSo deep in love with you Baby, baby, ooh till it's hurtin' meTill it's hurtin' meOoh, baby loveDon't throw our love awayDon't throw our love away One-syllable rhymes and repetitions all the way through. And it's more than 50 years ago. I could come up with several other examples, but you get the point. - Being that mediocrity is, by pure statistic, an inevitable circumstance. In other words: People are stupid; other people will necessarily profit from that, whether deliberately or not; and there's no way around it all. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you are correct, to an extent. Music as an industry has become more formulaic and quantified as the years have passed. Music producers and record companies choose artists that fit whatever genre tested well with focus groups, then push music like it on the radio, basically forcing people to listen to a song until they like it. This article shows how music has simplified over the years in order to appeal to a wider audience: Instrumentational Complexity of Music Genres and Why Simplicity Sells  But there will always be Indy groups and artists that perform unique music, you just have to look for it.
