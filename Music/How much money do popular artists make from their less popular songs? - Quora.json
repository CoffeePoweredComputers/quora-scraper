            "answer_text": "How much money do popular artists make from their less popular songs? Music artistes will probably make more money from their most popular songs than they do from their less popular songs. Probably, but not necessarily. I don\u2019t think anyone can really give you a better, more straightforward, answer to your question than that. No one can give you any specific figures because, for a start, there are no set limits on how much or how little an artist can make from a song. For example: Mick Jagger & Keith Richards are still making money from songs they wrote over 50 years ago. And some but probably less money from songs they recorded back then but didn\u2019t write themselves. Those old songs will still go on making money for their estate beneficiaries after they are both dead. So, sticking with The Rolling Stones I will now try to explain to you why it is perfectly possible for music artists to make more money from one of their less popular songs than from a more popular song This was their first Top 20 hit in the UK (November 1963)  Unlike their first single, it is the original recording (i.e. first released) version of this song and it is also the best known version of this song to most people. But the song was not written by any members on The Stones: it was written by Lennon and McCartney, and The Beatles\u2019 version was released later as a track on their second album - With The Beatles aka Meet The Beatles. This means that unless there was some special behind the scenes deal on the distribution of the songwriter royalties (highly unlikely in this particular case) Lennon and McCartney probably made more money from the sales of The Stones single than The Stones did. They would certainly have made more money from the song overall because they also released their own version and the song was covered by lots of other artistes as well. For example, Count Basie did a version:  No money there for The Stones from Count Basie. The songwriter royalties would all have gone to Lennon and McCartney. It really doesn\u2019t matter that The Stones version is better known than The Beatles version. The Rolling Stones didn\u2019t actually get to release their first self-penned A-side until their 6th single which was released in June 1964. This song:  I think I\u2019m right in saying that before this single The Stones didn\u2019t even get to release any of their own compositions as B-Sides Anyway it didn\u2019t even chart in the UK - but it was a Top 30 hit in the USA. Their next single went to number 1 in the UK and did OK in the US  But again they didn\u2019t write it. It was a cover of a Bobby & Shirley Womack song. The Stones didn\u2019t get to release one of their own songs as a single again until this one, which was their 10th single:  And again it didn\u2019t chart in the UK, but it did just make it into the US Top 20. So \u201cHeart Of Stone\u201d is really not one of their most popular songs; they\u2019re much better remembered for the song \u201cIt\u2019s All Over Now\u201d written by The Womacks (a lot of people probably think The Stones wrote that song). Whatever, it is perfectly possible that The Stones made more money from \u201cHeart Of Stone\u201d than they did from their much bigger hit \u201cIt\u2019s All Over Now\u201d. The songwriter royalties are a very important factor when considering who makes money from a hit song. But they are not, of course, the only factor. Trying to explain all the possible variables involved would take a very long time, and I don\u2019t even pretend to know all of them anyway. However, back in the day when singles still had B-Sides as well as A-Sides, and they could sell millions of copies, the composer royalties on sales were evenly split between the A and B. But the A side would usually get all, or at least most, of the airplay on radio and TV and make more money than the B side that way. So, any artist who had hits with cover versions but wrote their own B sides could make at least as much, if not more, from their less popular songs than their most popular songs. So, there you have it. It\u2019s complicated. It all depends\u2026etc.etc. The music business and how artists make money has changed a lot since the 1960s of course, but the economics involved certainly haven\u2019t got any less complicated to understand.
