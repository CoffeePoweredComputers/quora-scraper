            "answer_text": "In my opinion, \u2018The Greatest Discovery\u2019 is truly magnificent. This song is about a young child being introduced to their new baby brother. It doesn\u2019t have a chorus, or a middle 8, or even proper verses. It\u2019s like a poem in song and it\u2019s really beautiful. If you\u2019re looking for one from the parade of hits, you can\u2019t go wrong with Your Song or Border Song. Very beautiful in their own right, but not my personal favourite. ",
