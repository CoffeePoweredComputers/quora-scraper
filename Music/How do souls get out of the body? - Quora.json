            "answer_text": "The soul and the body are one the soul does not leave the body just your life force. Here is the bibles answer quoted from http://JW.org \u201cThe Bible\u2019s answer The word \u201csoul\u201d in the Bible is a translation of the Hebrew word ne\u02b9phesh and the Greek word psy\u00b7khe\u02b9. The Hebrew word literally means \u201ca creature that breathes,\u201d and the Greek word means \u201ca living being.\u201d * The soul, then, is the entire creature, not something inside that survives the death of the body. Consider how the Bible shows that the human soul is the whole person:  Adam was not given a soul \u2014he \u201cbecame a living soul\u201d When Jehovah God created the first man, Adam, the Bible says that \u201cman became a living soul.\u201d (Genesis 2:7, King James Version) Adam was not given a soul\u2014he became a living soul, or person.The Bible says that the soul can work, crave food, eat, obey laws, and touch a dead body. (Leviticus 5:2; 7:20; 23:30;Deuteronomy 12:20; Romans 13:1) Those activities involve the entire person.Is the soul immortal? No, the soul can die. Dozens of Bible verses refer to the soul as being mortal. Here are some examples: \u201cThe soul that sinneth, it shall die.\u201d\u2014Ezekiel 18:4, 20, King James Version.In ancient Israel, the punishment for the most serious offenses was that the \u201csoul shall be cut off.\u201d (Exodus 12:15, 19;Leviticus 7:20, 21, 27; 19:8, King James Version) The person would \u201cbe put to death.\u201d\u2014Exodus 31:14, King James Version.After a person dies, the literal term \u201cdead soul\u201d is used for the corpse in some Bible verses. (Leviticus 21:11, footnote; Numbers 6:6, footnote) Although many Bible translations use the terms \u201cdead body\u201d or \u201cdead person\u201d in those verses, the original Hebrew uses the word ne\u02b9phesh, or \u201csoul.\u201d\u201cSoul\u201d can mean \u201clife\u201d The Bible also uses \u201csoul\u201d as a synonym for \u201clife.\u201d For example, Job 33:22 uses the Hebrew word for \u201csoul\u201d (ne\u02b9phesh) as a parallel for \u201clife.\u201d Similarly, the Bible shows that a person\u2019s soul, or life, can be risked or lost. \u2014Exodus 4: 19; Judges 9: 17; Philippians 2: 30. This use of the word for \u201csoul\u201d helps us to understand verses in which the soul is said to be \u201cgoing out\u201d or \u201cdeparting.\u201d (Genesis 35:18; King James Version) This figure of speech indicates that the person\u2019s life is ending. Some translations render this expression at Genesis 35:18 as \u201cshe breathed her last.\u201d \u2014Good News Translation; New Jerusalem Bible. Where belief in an immortal soul comes from Christian denominations that believe in an immortal soul get this teaching, not from the Bible, but from ancient Greek philosophy. The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica says: \u201cBiblical references to the soul are related to the concept of breath and establish no distinction between the ethereal soul and the corporeal body. Christian concepts of a body-soul dichotomy originated with the ancient Greeks.\u201d God does not condone merging his teachings with human philosophies, such as belief in an immortal soul. Instead, the Bible warns: \u201cLook out that no one takes you captive by means of the philosophy and empty deception according to human tradition.\u201d \u2014Colossians 2:8.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Having the correct aqeedah (belief) is the most important thing. Ultimately, Allah controls everything. Nothing happens except by His permission, and He is has supreme power over all things. Zikr (remembrance) of Allah is our ultimate protection. Do lots of zikr, and the demon should flee. The verses of manzil are particularly effective. I recommend you Google this if you're unfamiliar with it. Unfortunately, there's just too much to this for me to delve into everything. For example, if your beliefs are polluted with shirk, and you have certain sins in your life, you'll have to rectify those things first. Your state of cleanliness is also crucial. Basically, there are many requisites driving demons away. Let me give you an analogy\u2026 Let's day you wanna put out a fire, but the fire is fueled by an endless supply of a highly flammable substance. Like, let's say an entire reservoir of ether is on fire. It doesn't matter how much water you chuck on the fire, because it's got an endless supply of fuel. Similarly, you could have an endless supply of fuel for those demons. Zikr might not be able to help you at all unless you first cut off that fuel supply. Perfect your aqeedah. Turn to Allah for help immediately. You must make dua (supplication). Even for dua, there are prerequisites, but it's too much to delve into everything. You must be in a state of purity. It's crucial. Learn about wudhu and ghusl. Also, learn about things which attract demons. If you're watching movies, listening to music, committing shirk by wearing certain amulets, etc, have animate images displayed in your surroundings, etc, you've created a fuel supply for demons. Basically, getting rid of demons might entail an entire lifestyle change. Calling out the azaan, reciting the manzil, doing zikr, making dua, etc, are all effective means of sorting your issue out, but you must correct your aqeedah, and get into a state of purity. Also, sometimes jinn only leave me entirely when my heart connects to Allah. Most people have jinn in them, but don't realise it. Most people will love their entire lives without ever experiencing the connection I'm talking about. There are varying degrees of protection, and varying degrees of demonic interference. Sometimes you'll only be afflicted to a certain level. Sometimes you'll only be protected to a certain level. But in my experience, the only time I'm generally totally free of them is when my heart connects to Allah, which isn't an easy thing, considering the state most of us are in. There's way too much to say about all this if I really delve into it, but I've given you the gist of it. Show me some true inclination to the advices I've provided, and perhaps I'll take more time to help you. ",
