            "answer_text": "Everyone who remembers the Peanuts TV specials will recall how that series clevery used a muted trumpet (Waaaah-wah-wah-wah) to imitate the adult voice. Many other instruments can do similar tricks by various means. For example: A well-played electric guitar (or other instrument), equipped with a \u2018Wah\u2019 pedal (variable bandpass filter) can make similar \u2018wah-ooh-aah\u2019 sounds, emulating components of speech. Great electric guitarists like Jimi Hendrix made this a trademark of their music.A so-called \u2018Talk Box,\u2019 conducts the sound of an instrument (via a flexible tube terminating next to the microphone) through the mouth of a singer, letting them modulate that sound \u2014 even forming words. Peter Frampton made this sound famous.Jaw harps, digeridoos, kazoos, harmonicas, and other instruments that recruit the voice and vocal tract can create articulate sounds.Music synthesizers, which enable refined sound-shaping, can create vocal and chorus effects on single vowel and sibilant sounds.Digital samplers, of course, can capture actual speaking and/or singing, alter the frequency, and place these samples under control of a keyboard or other input device. A recent art project featured a full keyboard, whose every key was programmed to speak a quote from the composer Leonard Cohen.But really, in the end, any instrument in the hands of a good and passionate player \u2014 one who\u2019s attentive to the rhythms and sounds of speech \u2014 can sound like speech.

            "answer_text": "Various organ stops can come very near to imitating human speech. The first, most obvious is named \u201cVox Humana\u201d which does exactly what it says on the stop knob. It consists of a set of small metal pipes, the bottom half contains a small vibrating metal reed while the top half is made as a cylindrical resonator to give the sound a specific tone and volume. How well it actually sounds close to the human voice depends on the builder\u2019s skill as a voicer, who will manipulate the pipes manually in order for them to produce a satisfactory sound. I have myself over the years developed a kind of hybrid rank of pipes which I have named \u201cErz\u00e4hler\u201d (German = Narrator). These consist of small square wooden pipes rather than metal without a large resonator at the top, only a smaller wooden compartment with small holes drilled on one side to let the sound escape is joined at the top. Each pipe within the rank is voiced to a specific vowel sound, either A, E, O or U. When voiced correctly, which takes several hours to perfect the sound is probably as close to the human voice that is possible using artificial means. However, because the pipes have to be quite small, this stop is only effective on small or medium sized organs. Otherwise if used in a building of cathedral proportions, the sound will hardly be heard. When both of these kind of stops are used in conjunction with a Tremulant, a device used to shake the wind gently, the effect is complete. ",
