            "answer_text": "Usually because acoustic guitars are a pain to amplify in live performances. They\u2019re often very quiet compared to other instruments on stage. The player needs to be able to hear the acoustic clearly over all the other noise, so they\u2019ll often have it sent out to on-stage monitor speakers. Because the guitar\u2019s mics or pickups will need to be set to a high gain to amplify the quiet sound of the instrument, they\u2019ll also be sensitive to the sound coming from the monitor speakers, which leads to feedback very easily. The hollow body of an acoustic resonates external sound very well which exacerbates the problem. Alongside this, the high sensitivity of any mics set to this high gain means that there will often be a lot of bleed from other instruments in the acoustic guitar channels if you have anything noisy like drums on stage. This can make everything difficult to mix well. Solutions like in-ear monitoring can help, along with using acoustic guitar pickups rather than microphones, but even good ones of these can sound plasticky and soulless. A good venue with a good sound engineer and decent equipment can overcome all these problems, but in these cases it could just be that the guitarist feels an electric guitar might sound more energetic than an acoustic in a live performance, or sometimes that they\u2019d rather not have to switch between instruments in a live performance if they\u2019re using an electric and an acoustic for different songs. Good acoustics are also expensive and fragile, so guitarists might be nervous about having them exposed to flying mic stands on stage and prefer to keep them at home.. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, plenty of working musicians switch between electric and acoustic guitars live. If the question is why do some guitarists use electric guitars lie to play parts originally recorded on acoustic, I think its mostly for pragmatic reasons. Its generally not any more technically difficult to play songs written for acoustic guitar on acoustic vs electric, particularly not if the acoustic part is just strumming open chords (which many of these are). So this isn\u2019t about \u201cdaring\u201d at all. If you have to play one acoustic part, but later an electric part, its easier to just stay on electric the whole time rather than switch instruments in the middle of a song. Good acoustic guitars tend to be fragile and a lot more expensive than solid-body electric ones. . .that alone is a good reason not to bring them into a chaotic live music setting where they need to be transported from place to place, and can get knocked about. Also just running an acoustic guitar on a loud live stage can be problematic in a lot of ways. Acoustic guitars are highly feedback prone under high sound pressure. To get best tone, you really want to mike these, and that requires another mike setup JUST for this, plus it requires that the performer stand right next to it, limiting their mobility on stage. Electric guitar is simply easier to run live, which is a big part of why they\u2019re so popular to start with! ",
