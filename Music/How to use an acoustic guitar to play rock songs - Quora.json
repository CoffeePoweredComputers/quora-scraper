            "answer_text": "You can play rock music with any sort of instrument, depending on what you consider to be rock music. Is it only rock music if there's a band? If there's distortion and huge amps and loud volume? If it's on stage? If it sounds angry? While some would like to define rock by its various genre conventions, those are more descriptive than definitive. Surf Rock and Deathcore are both rock. And, of course, Acoustic Rock is a thing. Whether written specifically to be played on an acoustic or covered through an acoustic rendition of a normally electric song, rock and acoustic guitars are tied together throughout rock's history. Due to affordability and versatility, a lot of famous rock instrumentalists probably started out playing and learning music on acoustic guitar. Songwriters the world over will figure out the first bones of a new song on whatever instrument is easiest to reach for in that moment, to get the idea down while it's fresh. For many that's a keyboard or an acoustic guitar. Being self-amplified but also not too loud helps with this, plus the mobility of it. For variations on normally amped-out rock music, check out any videos you can find of MTV's Unplugged (or literally the millions of videos of acoustic covers online), especially Nirvana's episode. As far as really bringing that passion, energy, and signature style that just feels like ROCK, there are a few things you can do with your playing to get that out of your solo acoustic guitar. Firstly, solos, riffs, licks, and single line melodies all sound much different without the affected sound of amps and pedals, but they are especially shaped by an absence of other sounds going on around them for support. With even just one other instrument to fill the space, a single line on an acoustic can work well, but sometimes if you try to go from playing chords into a sick solo when it's just you and the acoustic, all that's heard is a lot of empty space with little support. This isn't to say that it can't be done and even done well, but it's all about the context. For instance, if you'd like to have a softer or more contained section of a song, just a simple picking pattern, even one note at a time can work well to bring the dynamics down and contrast with more chord-driven, louder, or explicitly rhythmic sections. You can also take inspiration from folk tradition, wherein finger-picking patterns will play some notes alongside or around the melody, such as the bass note with some accent touches to keep the rhythm and chord structure in mind. With the melody at the heart of it for emphasis and the rest built around and underneath it, your range can imitate that fullness of a band just like guitarists and other instrumentalists have been doing for centuries. Secondly, keep in mind that of all the many varied origins that feed into what rock is today, Blues is still there at its roots. This means that no matter what instrument or setup you may be working with, you should find your groove. There are technical names for this in different schools and styles, but I like to think of it as what it feels like when your body is a part of the song. At the heart of a good rock song, you'll always find something that grabs you one way or another. It may be less obvious in some songs than others, but if you really wanna play rock, find your groove. If you can't hold onto anything else, you stick to that groove. If it's just you and that guitar, whether you're playing a hardcore headbanger or a folksy ballad, find the groove at basis of the song, where the melody and rhythm connect. If you can get the basic groove across to your audience, then what you lack in a band or parts or effects or amplification won't matter as much. Acoustic guitars work great at rhythm and chords, sing a melody over that and you've got a huge chunk of the history of contemporary music right there. That's why folks can pull out a guitar round the campfire (or just snap or clap along) and sing almost anything. Yeah, the famous lick or hot solo may help make a song great, but they wouldn't have a place to live if there wasn't some core groove going on underneath. Thirdly, know that you don't have to try and do everything a band is doing by yourself. Sure, nowadays you can get a loop pedal or strap a one-man-band set to yourself if you feel like it and have the dough, but if it's really just an acoustic guitar you're working with, then let it be that. Do your best to play the chords or picking pattern as best as you can, get that part down till it's a part of who you are and let it shine. For most audiences and performers, a well-rehearsed acoustic or even a cappella performance is way more entertaining and enjoyable than a hastily trudged through full band mud pile. Since you don't have the philharmonic behind you, try and figure out what it is you do have going for you as a solo performer with a single instrument. Don't be ashamed. Don't be shy. Be cognizant of your limitations and your possibilities and take ownership of it. Finally, rock is about attitude. Maybe at this point, rock is too generic a term to be united under anything, but for the most part I think it can be said that rock is, at it's core, about the idea of proclamation. No matter what you're singing or playing about, YOU are the one doing it. Even if you didn't write the song, you can kill it all the same by making it YOURS. YOUR love. YOUR lust. YOUR cause. YOUR pain. YOUR moment. Whether you're there to entertain the masses or busk in an empty subway station or chilling by yourself in your room, what takes a song from meh to ROCK is this declaration of purpose\u2014 You exist in this moment to do nothing less than rock. Sure, decide for yourself what that means, 'cause that's rock too. Unlike pop, where the nebulous idea of the x or it factor you might have can change based on trends, in rock music, all the auxiliary nonsense bends around you. Not to say that pop can't be existentialist in its own way, but I believe that rock is inherently about the insistence that what is, is, and that's the way it is. From the most soulful to the most chaotic and everywhere this, that, or other ways, if you want to play rock on an acoustic guitar, the only way to do it is to grab onto that core groove and make it your own. 'Cause why waste time on anything less than genuine? Just go rock. ",

            "answer_text": "Rock is an extremely diverse genre of music. What started as rock and roll in the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, quickly drew from other genres like the Blues, R&B, and even Jazz. While most Rock music is set on a hard, straight tempo, on a 4/4 (read: Four by Four), this can melt, evolve, reshape, and then melt all over again to become something new. While it\u2019ll be difficult to replicate and get the feel of Rock as a genre on an acoustic guitar, there are various ways to make up for it. The first is to know which kind of Rock it is that you want to play. You can accordingly change things around to suit the instrument. For Psychedelic Rock {think Pink Floyd (I LOVE Floyd)}, you\u2019ll need to think a certain way, and the same goes for Punk Rock (think Green Day, the Sex Pistols, and the Ramones). Beyond just the chords, the distortion, and the sheer headbanging that Rock brings with it, Rock is also about the attitude you bring to the table. Read the lyrics to songs that you want to play. Listen to the songs more and more - even on loop. There are quite a few guitarists who do a kickass job at playing Rock on an acoustic, although they may be selective about the genre. It\u2019s also possible to pick out a few songs from each band and play that on an acoustic. That way you can even sound fairly close to the actual song. Some good ones might be Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd, or Time of Your Life by Green Day. These are fairly simple, and they\u2019re both classics in their own right. Happy playing! ;) ",
