            "answer_text": "Actually, BTS and TXT\u2019s company (BigHit Entertainment) is hosting global auditions for those who have talent in singing, dancing, acting, modelling and/or rapping. Their criteria is simple: You have to be a boy. (I suppose they\u2019re only looking for boy groups.)Your birthday must be 1999 or later. 20 or younger, basically.You have to have talent in singing, dancing, acting, modelling and/or rapping.They are hosting in cities including New York, Toronto, Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei, Sydney, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo and Los Angeles. Considering that fact that they are also accepting people from NYC, Toronto, and Sydney as well as LA instead of just asian cities, I suspect it\u2019s not the biggest deal if you don\u2019t speak. Either way, it would be great for you to try. I\u2019m not sure if you particularly are familiar with BTS\u2019s label BigHit Entertainment, but I assure you that from my experience as an ARMY that they are very, very reliable and trustworthy. They make extremely elaborate plans, and they definitely know what they are doing. With BTS and TXT already debuted, the company would also be in good financial hands, so you don\u2019t have to worry about that either. A couple other reasons, despite not knowing BigHit personally: Very international-based fandom and platform60% of earnings (rumoured) are for the idols, and only 40% goes to company unlike other labels that have it the other way aroundSplits their idol\u2019s time into thirds: 2/3 working, practicing and producing, while 1/3 is for making content like RUN BTS for fans and relaxing, playing games, and being in the companionship of other members.There is always a shadow to the light, but BigHit certainly does well, compared to lots of other Entertainment groups that are ugly on the outside, and most likely even worse on the inside. Here\u2019s the link to the website: Big Hit Audition | Big Hit Entertainment If you meet the criteria, please figure out a way to apply. It could change you life forever. ",

If you was to make it as a trainee and you don\u2019t know korean they have korean classes that you take so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Welp that\u2019s all I got to say really ",
