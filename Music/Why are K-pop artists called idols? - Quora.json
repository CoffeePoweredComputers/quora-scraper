            "answer_text": "Because that's how they are marketed. They're shown as idols, not artists. The companies want the public to see them as the ideal boyfriend/girlfriend, rather than musically talented humans. Such a strategy is adopted because teens are the target audience for K-pop groups. They are gullible and would easily believe that their 'oppa' loves them and cares for them. That fuels their imagination, allowing them to believe that they could date their favourite idols. This imaginary romance leads them to support the idols and spend on albums, concert tickets, merchandise, and other stuff. The companies rake in dollars with this simple yet effective strategy. But there's a downside to this: Idols are forced into the mould of an 'ideal' person. They are banned from dating, drinking, smoking, and at times, getting tattoos, driving, going to clubs, etc. Bobby (iKON) once said that he wasn't allowed to interact with the members of Blackpink due to the ban on interaction between opposite genders in YG. Not only this, idols are also forced to suppress their thoughts, if it's against the popular opinion. They can't speak out against their fans or their company, for the fear of termination of the contract and being fined. All of that's changing now, thankfully. People are becoming a bit more accepting about idols dating, and idols are speaking out against mistreatment. Two members of TWICE turned out to be in a relationship, and fans seemed to take it well. Day6's Jae spoke out against Studio J's favouritism for YoungK, and their neglectful attitude towards him. And yet, Exo's Chen was bombarded with death threats and hateful comments when he announced his marriage to his pregnant, non-celebrity girlfriend. Things are changing slowly, but surely. I hope in the coming years, with the expansion of K-pop in the West, these talented young men and women will be called as Artists instead of Idols. I wish them freedom. ",

The Kpop artists are always so pretty/handsome and is always perfect. They always look good, smell good, and work hard. (At least some do) Some idols have been trainees for a long time and people respect them for that and call them their idol. ",
