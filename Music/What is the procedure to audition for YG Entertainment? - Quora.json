            "answer_text": "heloooo~ So, I\u2019ve never auditioned before but looking at those who have been eliminated lemme tell u a few things : - You probably should be south-east or west or south asian or half-asian atleast. - you have more chances to be selected as kpop represents asian culture not american or european etc.STAND OUT - Not in a wierd or bad way but show them something they rarely see instead of just singing like a kareoke or doing a cover dance. Trust me that won\u2019t work.There is no excuse to hardwork. Prepare really well for if u get selected your one in 10,000.DO NOT LET THEM IN TO THINKING YOU ARE GOING TO AUDITION TO MEET YOUR FAVOURITE IDOL OR YOU\u2019RE A SAESANG OR KOREABOO.DO NOT get hyper on seeing someone you like and know basic information or history of YG before you audition.Learn basic korean or english. It\u2019ll surely help.Train or enhance your vocal cords by eating less cold stuff etc., if you rap/sing as it\u2019ll not give you a nasally voice.THATS ALL FROM ME:) Best of luck and stan kpop ~~  ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on when the auditions are. Firstly you need to send them an e-mail with your personal information (name, date of birth, country of origin, your skills and such) along with a video (I think so, not so sure though) of you either singing or dancing (preferably both). You can choose any foreign song or a Kpop song, it doesn'T matter to them as long as you can show your talents good. End then they will contact you. These are online auditions and as for those who live in Korea - they need to show up at YG Ent at that day and time with a cd or usb stick with a song on it, of your own choosing. And then sing and/or dance along with it. Oh and rap, if that is your \"field\". This isn't very thorough, I know, but since I don't follow these things, I've only read from people who auditioned so... :) There is a video of an audition to YG so you should check it out! :) ",
