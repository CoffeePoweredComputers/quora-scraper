            "answer_text": "Yes of course! Marching band is a lot of time commitment and can be very taxing physically as well. At my school, people don\u2019t do marching band if they have other fall sports, want to focus on school, or if they have a physical illness or disability. (There is a kid at my school whose arms are very deformed who marched trombone which is amazing.) At some schools, the marching band program is small and not many participate. For my school, we are state champions for the past two years, so a lot of people want to be in our marching band. Ive talked with some of my friends who are in band but not in marching band and they say that they would feel left out, not knowing the inside jokes that their section had during marching band, and those who did marching band knew eachother already, which made it awkward for them. Don\u2019t let this discourage you. I will say that marching band is a ton of fun, but it is a huge time commitment. There are some instruments that can\u2019t be marched such as oboe, bassoon, euphonium, tuba, and french horn. They have to learn new instruments that were created to have the same sound, but are different shapes such as mellophone, sousaphone, and baritone. People who do oboe and basson have to learn different instruments all together or join colorguard. Going back to your question; yes, people can do band and not be in marching band, but at my school, the highest level band (symphonic band) is required to participate in marching band. Whether it is marching and instrument, being in pit (front percussion ensemble), or being in colorguard, they have to be there. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your school program. At the high school I went to, marching band WAS fall band, there were no other options. You could join spring semester for the second half of concert season but that meant you didn't get to participate in the Christmas show (which was the biggest, most fun concert that took place over 3 shows). No one ever joined just for spring semester. We either had kids drop band for other classes or switch instruments. At the high school I coach at now, they have 3-4 different band options so kids who don't want to march but still play have other options. They offer marching band, concert band, orchestra, and jazz band. ",

            "answer_text": "It just depends on your high school. When I went to Middleton High, the general rule was that you had to march at least a year before you could play in any other band. When I transferred to Eagle High, the rules changed: you had to march every year if you wanted to play in one of the higher up ensembles. I would ask the people in your local high school\u2019s band, no high school is the same. ",

Serious musicians don\u2019t have to play outside. The whole thing really is insulting for most of us. Drummers like it though. Try and get into the drum line. Drum line is where it\u2019s at in marching band. Drum line get to do the cadence. Drums also work great outside. ",

At my school, due to the fact that we spend a lot of time in class doing marching band things, we are required to be in either marching band or auxiliary to be in concert band. However, I many schools have different rules. ",
