            "answer_text": "CBS, rightly, doesn't give two belches in a hurricane what people who like Trek want. They're a corporation, one that likes money. Consequently, they've done research on the sort of storytelling and aesthetics people presently enjoy and have reframed Trek in that light. If the old fans want to see old Trek, they're welcome to stream it from several different sites. Or adapt and learn to enjoy what the new material has to offer, whether it's some revisionist history on Discovery, a different point of view on Starfleet's lofty ideals from Picard, or lampooning satire about old Trek tropes on Lower Decks.

I am not sure if NBC has \u201cfinally\u201d learned because they were the ones originally that gave up on the franchise. They are probably saying, \u201cWhat if\u201d today. ",
