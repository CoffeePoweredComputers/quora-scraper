            "answer_text": "Hey, I don\u2019t have a song. But I do have several CD\u2019s that hush me into the shadowy world called sleep. First, \u2018Era\u2019 and \u2018Era 2\u2019 - two albums by a group called \u201cEra\u201d. They have a kind of Gregorian Chant sound with electronic/pop-rock elements that feels like new-age music (think Deep Forrest). It\u2019s a great fusion and works very well. Also, the lyrics are written in and sound like Latin, but are deliberately meaningless. This is a bonus as you don\u2019t want to be warbling along to the tune. Then there is the group called \u201cDelirium\u201d. You may have heard of this band as one of their songs, \u2018Silence\u2019, was very popular not so long ago. And it has been called one of the greatest trance songs, ever. The CD's that I like are \u2018Semantic Spaces\u2019, \u2018Karma\u2019, and \u2018Chimera\u2019. All have the power to soothe you into the \u2018zone\u2019. Do not have the volume up too high as this defeats the purpose. Barely audible is good. And no lights. If the above doesn\u2019t work try playing an album of Gregorian Chants. And if this doesn\u2019t flick the switch \u2026 perhaps someone will write in with something that does. Below are the lyrics to \u2018Silence\u2019 and you can find clips of all the above on youtube. ta david Lyrics for \u2018Silence\u2019 Give me ReleaseWitness meI am OutsideGive me peace Heaven holds a sense of wonderAnd I wanted to believeThat I'd get caught upWhen the rage in me subsides I can't Help this longingComfort meI can't Hold it all inIf you won't let me Heaven holds a sense of wonderAnd I wanted to believeThat I'd get caught upWhen the rage in me subsides In this white waveI am sinkingIn this silenceIn this white waveIn this silenceI believe In this white waveI am sinkingIn this silenceIn this white waveIn this silenceI believe I have seen youIn this white waveYou are silentYou are breathingIn this white waveI am free ",

            "answer_text": "Lovin' You by Minnie Riperton. The song's music is so beautifully simple, and gentle. Just 2 instruments acoustic guitar, and a keyboard, birds in background. The words are beautifully felt as she gently sings her own feelings in this beautiful song that can be almost be called in addition to a love song, a lullaby. I have gone to sleep and have woken up to this song, and it seems that I'm more at peace, calmer, and more rested, than if I had to listened to another song. It is truly a unique song that people never seem to get tired of, in the 43 years since it was done, truly a classic. ",
