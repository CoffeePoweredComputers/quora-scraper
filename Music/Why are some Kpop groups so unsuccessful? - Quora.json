            "answer_text": "Company Most successful groups or semi-successful groups are from bigger companies. So that means companies like: SMJYPYGPledisCubeBigHitThese companies have successful groups and are well known. ITZY got a lot of hype for their debut, so did TXT. Groups from these companies are almost always at least semi-successful. Recources If they have the right resources, they have a bigger shot, because they have more money to make a good song, MV and good promotion, most of the companies that have more successful groups have resources. Music ATEEZ was from an unknown company and all of their music videos have around 10\u201320 million views. Because their music was good, they got more hype and turned out to be pretty successful. Because their song was found out by the right persons who spread it on social media and that\u2019s what made them successful. BTS almost disbanded in 2014, but when I Need U was released they got their first win and became more successful and they blew up with Blood, Sweat & Tears. These songs were spread because they were good, on social media and because ARMYs spread their music on social media, they became successful. And these songs are still considered as a few of the best songs that BTS has released. I\u2019ve checked out so many underrated groups and artists, but not a lot of songs got my attention. I didn\u2019t like them or thought they were boring. I\u2019m sure they are all talented but if I don\u2019t like the music, I won\u2019t tell everyone to listen to it. Good Promotion Without the right promotion, groups will die out, don\u2019t give them a comeback for a year and they aren\u2019t from SM, JYP or YG? They will be forgotten. Just release a MV and 3 live perfomances and they are from a small company? Small chance they\u2019ll be discovered. Without promotion, most groups are doomed to fail. Also for some groups there is almost nothing to find, no content, no translations for anything, so then how do you get into a group that has almost no content? Luck Maybe groups have the resources, good music and good promotion but they still won\u2019t be successful. Groups from small companies have to be found by the right people. People who will spread the word, people who have followers or people willing to listen, people who will keep promoting them. And based on luck they\u2019ll be found, or they\u2019ll not be found. With luck they\u2019ll have the chance to be successful. If groups under small companies don\u2019t have it, they\u2019ll have a big chance of failing. Timing If a group from a small company debuts while a group from a big group is debuting at the same time or a big scandal is happening, who will get the most attention? Probably not the group from the small company. How will they get the chance to shine if a big group is having a comeback? If they have a comeback or debut at the wrong time they\u2019ll have less attention. While you\u2019re here please check out these songs:    ",

            "answer_text": "If the group isn\u2019t in the big 3 + Big Hit, a lot of it is based on luck. Even if known companies like Woolim, Stone Music, FNC, Starship, Jellyfish, Loen, TS, and many more have to rely on simply luck. Just like Big Hit did with BTS, Big Hit back then never had a well known artist there until now. However, aside from that there are two factors I think would be why some kpop groups just aren\u2019t successful besides being unlucky. Appeal. I\u2019m not gonna lie, but there are groups that really just aren\u2019t appealing. Mainly due to concept, type of music the come out with, or being simply generic. There are groups that mostly appeal to international fans like KARD and there are groups that mostly appeal to Koreans like BTOB and Gfriend. KARD is successful but not that successful in South Korea. BTOB and Gfriend don't seem that successful to international fans but in South Korea they are. Same with the type of audience, some are more appealing to certain genders and ages. It all just depends. If companies that aren't in the big 3 debut a group, appealing to the public is just as important as promoting. If you don't appeal, it will really be hard to find success. Nine Muses for example, had a company that promoted them quite as often as these popular groups, many of their fans regardless of international or South Korean wanted to see their success. But its hard because there is competition on how to appeal to the general public.Company Promotion. Kind of an obvious answer. There are companies that don't do much for their groups, regardless if they are popular companies. CLC is a group that isn't as successful as G-Idle despite debuting before them and being in the same company. But its all due to how Cube has been treating CLC. Promoting is quite important, if you don't see or hear much from a group you like in a while, are you really going to continue to want to care about them? Promoting comes with good management, if there isn\u2019t good management there won\u2019t be good promoting.",
