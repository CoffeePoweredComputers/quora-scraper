            "answer_text": "Well, there are many versions of a song because, every artist has his own perception of a particular track. Sometimes, the other versions of a song are better than the originals. Sometimes, the chord patterns of songs match and artist make covers and mixes of two or more tracks, because, out of love for music and what not!! Many versions of a song. Reprise, Sad, Dubstep and bla bla blaWhy? Everytime the same style becomes monotonic. Just to get a different flavour, the songs are released. ",
