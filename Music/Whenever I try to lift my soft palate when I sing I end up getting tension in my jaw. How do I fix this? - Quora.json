            "answer_text": "It\u2019s interesting that you frame this question this way; I\u2019d encourage a more pragmatic approach to learning to sing. Singing, unlike many other things, is not inherently about following a specific set of rules, which we then call technique. The point of learning to sing is to sound good while singing, and technique is what we call whatever it is that helps you do that. If actively lifting your soft palate gives you jaw tension, maybe don\u2019t lift your soft palate. As it happens, there\u2019s a voice science reason why actively lifting the soft palate can cause jaw tension: the soft palate actually lifts involuntarily as soon as you start to phonate, so whatever you\u2019re doing to lift it higher is likely to cause extraneous tension. The whole \u201cactively lift your soft palate\u201d thing is something that a lot of teachers take for granted as smart, but that a lot of voice scientists are skeptical about. But even if there weren\u2019t some voice science backing up your experience, if that\u2019s your experience, you should trust it. Singing is all about developing an understanding of what makes you sing beautifully and easily. You should be willing to challenge some conventional wisdom to do that, while still taking into account that if a bunch of smart people are saying something, it might be helpful to you. ",

            "answer_text": "To lift your soft palate, you shouldn\u2019t be moving your jaw - just let your jaw hang comfortably when you sing. Try breathing in through your mouth and making a gentle \u2018k\u2019 or \u2018cuh\u2019 sound - the feeling of openness in your mouth you get after that is the feeling of having your soft palate raised. Now just keep on trying to mimic that feeling when you sing and remember not to use your jaw - do jaw stretching exercises such as a slow, deliberate opening/closing of the jaw in a \u2018chewing\u2019 motion or simply opening your mouth wide and gently stretching your jaw downwards with your hand.
