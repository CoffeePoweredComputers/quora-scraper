            "answer_text": "Emo means for emotional. The emo music most people think of is like My Chemical Romance, Chiodos, In Fear And Faith, etc which are great bands with true emotion. Musical Artist Matthew Edward Hall pushed Emotional intensity to and past its limits with the song \u201cStairway To Earth.\u201d that's Emotional Music at its heights. Metal to me sounds like fake intense emotions and fake intense sound. Listening to that Song by Matthew Edward Hall, or some of John Lennons most emotionally intense songs like \u201cMother,\u201d \u201cNo Body Loves You When You're Down And Out,\u201d \u201cIsolation,\u201d etc is where the true Emo Music resides.

            "answer_text": "Let me tell you a short story. I LOVE heavy metal. When I was in middle school (mainly 6th and 7th grade) I was in the emo group. I wasn\u2019t actually emo, all of my friends were. When I would play metal songs for them, they would complain that it\u2019s too heavy for them and that they don\u2019t like it. Metal and emo are two VEEEEEERY different genres of music. Take for instance three days grace (my favorite metal band). Listen to any of their songs ( I recommend infrared or animal but now is not the time for me to fangirl about them) now listen to any popular emo band like panic! At the disco or my chemical romance. One might ( and should hopefully) hear the difference between the two. I hope this was hopeful for clearing up any confusion. ",
