            "answer_text": "We\u2019re out there, promise. While I can\u2019t answer for everyone I\u2019ll give you my thoughts on it as we\u2019ve got a few years under our belt. I\u2019d say by and large it\u2019s cultural and is learned, or unthought, behavior. It was quite a shock to my family when we first started dating and at one point I had to make a choice between them and her. I chose both. And it worked. Fear on many levels was at the root of it, not some ingrained and immovable racism. I think it has a lot to do with \u2018outside the box\u2019 thinking and exposure. It\u2019s generally a cultural \u2018norm\u2019 that we don\u2019t stray far from what we experience and what\u2019s expected whether intentionally or out of simple proximity. Most of us like sheep do what we know. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing but it can be a tough nut to crack. I\u2019ve always been rebellious and found the cultural norms claustrophobic so was always open to things outside of what I knew. I suppose had I been exposed to a more diverse community (and not just stereotypes learned through entertainment media) while growing up it would not have been such a big deal. I can\u2019t speak for all but the first time my wife smiled at me I was smitten. It was instant. It took me a few months and some guts to finally ask her out but it was a whirlwind once I did as we were so incredibly different in so many different ways. Race, depending on where you live, is so much more than just skin color. What is behind the skin color makes all the difference in the world. She is from Jamaica and within her family race wasn\u2019t (and isn\u2019t) a big deal. Jamaica\u2019s motto is: \u2018Out Of Many One People\u2019 (ironically, perhaps, very much like E Pluribus Unum) but when she was transplanted to the East Side of Youngstown at age 14 she encountered culture shock of her own. As a preacher\u2019s kid she has an even more unique perspective on race. Then you take a guy like me from a small suburb, almost farm country, very much not churched and you can imagine the fireworks. We\u2019ve been together for 25 years, 19 of those as husband and wife, and I can\u2019t imagine my life otherwise. Our differences, though we often collide, have enabled us to grow into something beautiful.  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m Jewish, so not \u201cwhite,\u201d but not black, either. I dated a black woman in college (though she didn\u2019t live in the same city, it was a long distance relationship with high long distance bills, as this was the early 90\u2019s). She was beautiful and artistic. She was my friend\u2018s cousin, and he brought her when he came to spend the day with me, my family, and a college friend I\u2019d brought home for the weekend. I really liked her, on an emotional and physical level. But she was very into Christianity, and as a Jew I wasn\u2019t interested in that. She wouldn\u2019t let it go, over and over she\u2019d want to know why I \u201ccouldn\u2019t be a Christian and a Jew at the same time,\u201d and didn\u2019t accept my refusal. We talked for hours every day, I went to visit her twice and we stayed at my hotel together. I asked her to be my girlfriend, and she said she was flattered, but no. I was pretty hurt at this rejection, and backed off from talking to her as much. She called me a few days later and said she loved me. I was still hurt, and told her I loved her, but as a friend. I don\u2019t know if I would have handled it differently at a different stage in life, but she was only the third girl I\u2019d seriously dated, and I didn\u2019t see a future with the religious difference. Maybe I did the right thing, who knows. A couple months later I graduated college, and was at home wondering what to do next. Her cousin called me on New Year\u2019s Eve and invited me over to celebrate, and said she\u2019d be there. We had a nice night together, the three of us, and she and I shared the couch. After we said goodbye, I never spoke to her or saw her again. No bad feelings, just no future. I eventually drifted away from her cousin, and he and I haven\u2019t talked for over a decade, so I have no idea where she is. I hope she\u2019s doing well. If things (especially the religion) had been different I could\u2019ve seen marrying her and having kids, but that ended up happening with someone else. P.S. My cousin married a black woman, and they just had their first kid a few months ago. ",
