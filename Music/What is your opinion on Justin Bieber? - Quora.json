            "answer_text": "In a few years from now he will be forgotten. He has no talent, no dancing skill, no songwriter ability, cannot sing. He is a manufactured \u201c star\u201d with no charisma. He is not eloquent or intelligent. His success has gone to his head. He is extremely overrated. He only appeals to 12 and 14 years old. He is not even worthy to talk about. There are dozens of other singers who are by far more talented than him and are not given half the promotion or attention he is. His music has no cultural significance. It is not groundbreaking or gamechanging. He is not a baritone, not even a tenor, he has no chest voice, no falsetto, no vocal range whatsoever. His songs are catchy yet corny. They will not stand the test of time. He has absolutely nothing to contribute to either music or dance. He is the epitome of how limited real talent is in music industry nowadays. His commercial success is a result of promotion not of actual talent. He is incredibly lucky to have had this success and thus this net worth. I would not attend his concerts even if i was paid. He cannot sing to save his life. He is the reason legends like Elvis, Prince and Michael Jackson will never be forgotten and will always be legends. He does not have a fracture of their genius, talent, charisma, stage presence. He does not have a fracture of Justin Timberlake\u2019s and Bruno Mars\u2019 talent, let alone Michael Jackson and Prince. ",

            "answer_text": "My opinion of Justin Bieber always seems to be changing. When he was just starting out I could not have cared less. He was just an obnoxious little boy making music for little girls, and I was way way out of that demo. As he started to get a little older, his music started to get a little better but his behavior went off the rails. It wasn't annoying pop tunes anymore. It was a kid who seemed like a danger to himself and those around him. But now... well. This article nicely sums up a lot of my feelings. The music isn't perfect -- it's still maturing -- but it's actually good now. And then on top of that, he's totally reformed his image and seems to be growing up. So... I mean... I guess I like him. Purpose is good, and he doesn't seem to be that dumbass kid anymore. Good for him. ",

When it comes to his music, yup it is quiet dancy and catchy.  I honestly believe that he is a really brave guy. I say so because despite the huge amount of hate from the masses he persevered. I can't even imagine dealing with so much hate. I mean if some one comments on my answer to merely ask something regarding the topic/issue I wrote about, I go like, \"omg how am I supposed to reply?\" And \"was he being sarcastic?\" Or \"is she making fun of me?\".  Maybe it's just my thing. You know.  So yeah, that's my opinion about Justin Bieber. ",

Most of the boys out there hates him beacuse they are jealous, as he became very succesful at a young age. They always trolls him by saying \u201cgay\u201d and many other disgusting words. Although, girls like him because of his good looks. I think people should accept his success and stop making his fun. I believe his biggest hater in the world also listens to his songs, so, stop swagging in front of your friends by insulting him and respect his work. Edit:- I have also made fun of him many times but the views are now changing. ",

Hey haters, just look at him now. He DOESN'T care about these things now. He wears anything, he didn't even get a haircut for a long time, he grew his moustache. But still beliebers love him from the core of their heart. I am ready to fight the whole world for him though I have been bullied for being a belieber. But I just want him to know that he is doing so great. He inspires me in my everyday struggle. Thank you so so much, Justin. You will always be my favourite boy in the whole universe. You are so talented, kind and giving. You have the voice of an angel. Te amo, TESORO. To all the haters, please stay away\u2026..  ",
