            "answer_text": "I personally wouldn\u2019t call that \u2018incredibly wide musical taste\u2019. With the exception of TOP, by which I assume you mean the Korean rapper, those are all white musicians, either from the USA or the UK. Still, not bad. Here are some suggestions: Because you said you liked Bowie, you might like Talking Heads. Because you said you liked blink-182, you might like Husker Du, who helped to invent pop-punk. Because you said you liked Suburban Legends, you might like the Skatalites (who were a real ska band from Jamaica.) Because you said you liked Bob Dylan, you might like Fela Kuti, who\u2019s kind of like the Nigerian equivalent of early Dylan, except he\u2019s not playing folk-ish type music but high-energy Afrobeat with a strong jazz influence. Because you said you liked the Shins, you might like Thin White Rope, who were an aggressive 80s band from California that never made it as big as some of their peers but who were incredibly great when they were on form. I\u2019m not great on rap - not that I don\u2019t like it, but there\u2019s just so much of it and I\u2019m wary of recommending the same old names to people. I mean, I could name a lot of people from Jay-Z through Mos Def and De La Soul to the Beastie Boys, but I would advise you to just dive in there. But in the meantime, for some cutting edge rap, here\u2019s Zebra Katz and Njena Reddd Foxxx. You will notice that a lot of these tracks are from the past. This is not because I only listen to music from the past, because I don\u2019t (in fact the other day I bought an album by Chris Thile and Brad Mehldau that had come out the previous week), but the music that you cited made me think mostly of past music.

            "answer_text": "If you like blink-182 you should look at: Sum 41, Rise Against, Yellow Card, All Time Low, Green Day, and The Academy Is\u2026 If you like Goldfinger you should look at: The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Against Me, Less Than Jake, and PVRIS. If you like David Bowie you should look at: The Pixies, Joy Division, The Kinks, Oasis, Blur, and The Cranberries. If you like Bob Dylan you should check out: The Beatles, The Violent Femmes, and The Worriers. If you like TOP, check out: My Chemical Romance, Jack Off Jill, Rage Against the Machine, and Billie Eilish. ",
