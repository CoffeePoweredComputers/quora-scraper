            "answer_text": "I think it may be one of those situations that it may depend on your age.. and who YOU are as a person. In my 20s and even unto my mid 30s I was sensitive, not assertive at all.. generally allowed myself to be mistreated, dismissed and walked upon.. A \u201cpeople pleaser\u201d and wouldn't have dreamed of offending my friends, so I would have said nothing. Now, another 30 years has gone by, and while I am still a sensitive, gentle soul, I refuse to be walked upon. Nothing gets my ire up like being treated and talked to dismissively. And sometimes those \u201cfriends\u201d just aren't worth the bother. We're all different. Lots of factors influence who we are and what we become. Be true to who you are. If you don't enjoy your friends music, perhaps you can just kindly express your lack of interest in what they enjoy. You don't have to agree with every one about every thing.. Pick your battles.. And you can disagree with out having to be disagreeable. My two cents worth. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been in situations like this. While it is very hard to forcefully like a type of music that you don't actually like, one thing is for sure \u2014 there is an individual artist behind that art and that artist has his or her own world-view and that manifests in the music they make, which means that while definitely there is \"art\" present in their music, there is also \"heart\" there. It's literally a piece from them that they are willing to give to the world. Also, we have to also acknowledge that their music is not for us, rather it is for those who actually like that kind of music. So to cut it short, just support your friend. A simple 'good job' will do. ",
