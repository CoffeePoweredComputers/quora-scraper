            "answer_text": "As an musician, your SoundCloud is your portfolio. While it has its obvious flaws, SoundCloud is currently the most popular music sharing tool on the web. Your music, no matter how good it is, needs a little push to get it in front of people. Below are 5 steps to create a system that will bring in daily SoundCloud followers. This article is written with electronic producers in mind, however all musicians can benefit from these strategies.  1. Constantly release good music Juggle your tracks by releasing on the tail You cannot expect to release a track every few months and see the growth you would like. These tactics all work better with the more music you release. This system works exponentially better each time that you release music. The more music that you release, the more chances people have to repost and follow you. The more people repost you, the more people your music gets exposed to. The more people who follow you, the more people can repost the next song you release.  Visual representation of releasing on the tail. As one track dies, another is born. Notice how Track 2 piggybacks off of Track 1\u2019s success. This is momentum. Aside from the numbers, releasing rapidly will make it appear like you\u2019re blowing up. Think of artists like Luca Lush, San Holo, and Marshmello, who sprinted their way to the top by relentlessly sharing music. Make people believe that you are everywhere. While it may sound like you should release a track every day, you shouldn\u2019t. When you want to build momentum and growth, you must wait to upload a track after the last one starts to die. Budi Voogt mentioned this method in The SoundCloud Bible, and I like to call it releasing on the tail. The tail is the long curve downwards after your track has reached its peak. By releasing on the tail, you throw a ball up in the air while the other is coming down. To know when to release the next tune, check your SoundCloud Play stats for Daily Plays. If your daily plays have been decreasing steadily for the past three days, upload a new track immediately. Repeat this process. When you release on the tail, each track gets full attention. Also, the next track gets bigger than the one before. If timed right, you will still have the attention of the listeners of your last track for when you release the next one.  2. Make it for free Don\u2019t try selling something nobody wants When you are starting off, it is better to have lots of people who have downloaded your music versus a few people who buy your music. Dedicated fans aside, nobody wants to buy music. Even if a song is for sale, most people will find a way to download it for free. Some people even give up on a song if they don\u2019t want to buy it and can\u2019t find it for free. As an artist, you want to be able to control where people download your music and benefit from it. By posting free music, you can easily get your music into anyone\u2019s hands. People who don\u2019t believe in buying music can have your music. People who are on budgets and can\u2019t afford to buy music can now have your music. I\u2019ve worked for record labels where artists with less than 1k on their socials could barely sell any tracks, or even get anyone to stream on Spotify. Do not confuse releasing with labels, being on Beatport, Spotify etc. as a sure way for success. Hold out for selling tracks until you have people who want to buy.\u201d  3. Install a download gate Just because your music is free, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t ask for something Installing a download gate is the way to benefit off of releasing free music. A download gate will connect to a fan\u2019s SoundCloud or social media platforms and require them to interact\u2014follow, like, tweet, post, etc\u2014in order to receive the track. We personally use Hive.co because it offers the widest range of social interactions (Toneden & Click also have their benefits. Pick which is best for you.)We recommend setting up these interactions for every download: Follow SoundCloud, Repost song on SoundCloud, Like Facebook, Follow Spotify/Instagram/Snapchat (optional). Carnage uses download gates to grow his Spotify, SoundCloud, and Facebook accounts. Which social media platforms you include in your download gates is up to you. The first 2 are absolutely vital. By having fans follow you to download, they will get the next song into their feed. By requiring a repost, fans who download are organically spreading your music to their friends\u2019 feeds. Economists call this self-serving model an economy of scale, the building block of monopolies. The non-SoundCloud actions are a little subject to your personal style. A good portion of artists dislike Facebook because it doesn\u2019t allow them to promote their music as far as they would like. However, it can serve a different purpose. We recommend building artists\u2019 Facebook fans because it\u2019s often what promoters look at to judge an artist\u2019s reach and popularity. If streaming is the future of music, it\u2019s wise to grow your streaming following. Plus, Spotify allows you to request for verification with only 250 followers. Instagram and Snapchat are good options if you feel you are particularly strong on either platform. Choose what you are good at, and don\u2019t overwhelm your fans with a 7-network list of requirements to download your music. 4. Make some friends Team up with friends to share each other\u2019s audiences Teaming up with other producers, in a collective or just as homies, brings great SoundCloud growth. Talk to your producer friends about reposting each other\u2019s releases. This will bring your audience to their music, their audience to your music, and, if you two are similar in sound and talent, will be beneficial for the both of you. If you are formally in a collective, this factor multiplies by 100. Not only can all collective member repost each other, but you can release compilation albums as a collective. You can put a download gate on these compilation albums, requiring users to follow everyone in the collective in exchange for the album.   5. If you remix, be careful Avoid remixing & copyright mistakes Remixing can be a great way to get attention to your brand by borrowing someone else\u2019s. It is also frowned upon in many cases. SoundCloud is notorious for deleting remixes and banning accounts for copyright infringement. When releasing an unofficial remix, many producers choose to release on a separate SoundCloud \u201cRemix/Bootleg\u201d account. This way, their official account will avoid copyright strikes for uploading remixes. Plus, blogs will be able to repost the song without risking copyright violation on their accounts. Mid-level electronic artists are generally more okay with remixes and less likely to file copyright violations than Top-40 or big label artists. Some producers, when releasing an unofficial remix, will choose to create a unique name other than the original track. For example, BLU J\u2019s remix of Rihanna \u2013 Umbrella is titled UMBRLA. Labels and distributors have a harder time filing a strike against a remix that is named something other than the original title. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re an aspiring artist, SoundCloud can be an excellent way to boost your exposure and attract a following. With over 175 million users and growing, this site has been used by many artists, big and small, as a highly effective marketing tool. The key to SoundCloud success is attracting a robust following of listeners, as more listeners translates into more exposure and better visibility on the site. But, it is really tough to be heard among the sea of different artists. be sure to check out these seven tips. 1. Use SoundCloud Ads You can always advertise your tracks with SoundCloud to expand your reach. SoundCloud Ads, also known as Promoted Tracks, which can be purchased by artists, include a mixture of a radio-style audio ads, display advertising on mobile, and native advertising. Thousands of artist have used this method of promoting their tracks with a lot of success.  However, ads can get expensive. Very expensive. The average SoundCloud promoted track campaign can run you up several thousand or even tens of thousands of dollars. This option is usually out of reach for most new and upcoming artists, so lets move on. 2. Post on Music Forums and Subreddits To get more listeners, you need to spread the word about your SoundCloud profile. The easiest way to do this is to post links to your profile on relevant forums and subreddits. There are tons of forums and subreddits out there dedicated solely to music, and many music lovers utilize these as resources to find new artists. Do some research to find the most relevant forums and subreddits in your niche, and start posting! 3. Buy SoundCloud Plays There is no denying it: In an increasingly oversaturated music industry, it can be hard for your music to be heard. To boost your visibility on SoundCloud, it is critical that users are playing your songs regularly. The more plays you have, the more visible you will be. If you are struggling to attract listeners, it can be advantageous to buy SoundCloud plays. While it is true that this pretty much equates to artificially inflating your play count, as a result you will garner more real followers. There is a variety of services that offer SoundCloud plays, and prices vary, so you will want to do your research before making a purchase. Some providers, such as BUILD MY SOCIALS offer 20,000 plays for as little as 29$.  4. Make A Music Video Songs are great, but music videos are even better. Consumers\u2019 demand for video content is rapidly rising. Sharing music videos on your social media pages with a link to your SoundCloud profile is a highly effective cross-promotion social media marketing strategy. Research consistently shows that video content receives more shares and higher engagement than any other content on the web. Making a music video will also give your fans visuals to remember you and your music, offering much more benefits than just attract more plays on SoundCloud. 5. Use Facebook Ads Posting songs on Facebook can be a great way to lead people to your SoundCloud profile, helping you attract more listeners. And just like you can promote your SoundCloud content via Twitter with promoted tweets, you might also consider promoting your content via Facebook with Facebook Ads. This will improve the visibility of your Facebook posts, which can translate into more listeners. 6. Comment On Related SoundCloud Tracks If you\u2019re an aspiring alternative artist, work to find and connect with other artists within your niche. The easiest way to do this is to comment on these artists\u2019 SoundCloud tracks. Not only will you forge new relationships, you will also increase your visibility within the SoundCloud community, enhancing your exposure to potential listeners in your niche, as mentioned by SoundCloud themselves. However, the key here is to leave high-quality comments. You want show a genuine interest and leave comments that are upbeat and constructive. In other words, a cursory \u201cGreat Song!\u201d or \u201cNice Track!\u201d isn\u2019t going to cut it. You want to leave comments that show off your knowledge and cultivate a positive reputation on the site. Remember, every comment you leave is a potential path for a new listener to get to your page, so you always want to make a great first impression. Hope that helps you! ",

            "answer_text": "SoundCloud could be a bit overwhelmed especially when you just new in it. There\u2019s millions of active users uploading and promoting on SoundCloud it\u2019s just harsh to compete. When you\u2019ve done everything you could, I would be convinced that you rely solely on your music quality. I am not saying that you shouldn\u2019t be focusing on your music, however you need some kind of boost to get you started.  You can effectively build your SoundCloud audience by getting real user\u2019s followers to your SoundCloud profile and get reposts of your music track. Getting on followers doesn\u2019t necessarily could reach more target audience, but if you\u2019re getting both followers and repost, there\u2019s definitely some result. However, you should know the purchased followers and repost, doesn\u2019t mean that those users actually have interest in your music track. You need to optimize other ways to gain more audience the right ones through;  1 - First impressions always the last After you\u2019ve registered and cover the important basics on having the best profile page or your band, profile picture, logo and your bios. You can then consider the option of upgrading your account to one of the Pro options. Other than, the obvious benefits such as being able to upload more music, the premium package also deliver the spotlight spot for premium users to tools to boost their presence on SoundCloud. The pro account will give you the detail stats on where your music gets played from, which you can then use to market your music accordingly. 2 - Share your music track on other platforms SoundCloud plays a crucial role of your social channel strategy, whether you are a veteran or a new artist trying to make it on the music industry. Whenever you post your music on SoundCloud, be fervent about posting it on Instagram, Twitter and etc. Your fans might find it easy to reach you and give much attention to your music. Not only that it also can help to boost more plays and hopefully your fans using SoundCloud will interact with your by commenting and sharing your song on it. 3 - Join more groups SoundCloud is a community that could help you to boost exposure and build audience by submitting your music to variety of groups on the platform. You can find similar artists belong to and submit your music to be posted on the group. You can start by browsing through the search feature, where you can find groups in genres raging from EDM, to Top 40, to indie rock and etc. Try to be sensible about how many tracks and how often your post to each group because you don\u2019t want to come as spammy and watch as your play counts and followers increase over time. 4 - Attract people with the creation of music video You can start by creating a music video to the music track that famously being shared or plays on SoundCloud. It will help to bringing in more traffic because people are more keen in watching, listening and sharing video content compared to audio or text. You can use big platform such as YouTube and various other video streaming site to get traffic from. People are using YouTube to find all sorts of things, and most likely that your listeners are looking for the video of your music track as well. If the video exist, it\u2019ll make the sharing process easy, because so many people are into YouTube compared to SoundCloud. 5 - Make the best use of the tags SoundCloud could be very generous on it\u2019s music tags it could be varies from genres of songs to mood. You can integrate them that\u2019s relevant to your music track so that it will make it easy for people to find your music through the keywords. If you\u2019re not sure about it, you can use plenty of keywords or SEO tools out there to choose the most searched keywords in your music niche and then incorporate that to your music track. 6 - Tell stories using your music track You can tell a lot of stories using your music track on SoundCloud where within a few minutes and seconds you can put certain text to it people would likely interested in reading them. Some artists on SoundCloud actually tell a lot of stories within just one music track. It should be genuine on how the process of the music or something about how you can come up of the beat. It could also be something unrelated to the creation of the music, but perhaps something that could bin you with the listeners. All the best and goodluck! ",

            "answer_text": "If you really want your music to be listened, forget about the internet. Play your music live. If you do it, maybe you can get visits to your soundcloud, but just because people liked your music when they listened to it live. Yes, we all know that some guy got millions of clicks in one week, but this is extremely rare and it usually doesn\u2019t depend on the music. The only really succesful cases that I know, are all videos in which the visual component plays a major role, for instance, the videos of Modern Jukebox (and even in that case, they play covers, that means that people looked for known songs in Youtube and a video of a cover version appears). I know it\u2019s against common oppinion. People tend to think: \u201cHey, there are millions of people everyday listening to music on the net, your music can reach millions, even billions\u201d. Yes, you can be heard in all the known universe, but unless you are a well known musician and people really like you from before, internet is the easiest way to bury your music into oblivion. You don\u2019t believe me? Think about when was the last time that you bought a recording from an unknown musician because you navigated in soundcloud and you discovered his amazing music. My teenager students have thousands of tracks in their laptops. Almost all of those tracks are from well known artists. But sometimes they go to a gig, listen to an unknown band and really like it, and then they look for it in soundcloud. Internet banalizes music creation, because everything is at the click of the mouse. If you want people to remember you, give them a show that they enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re an aspiring artist, SoundCloud can be an excellent way to boost your exposure and attract a following. With over 175 million users and growing, this site has been used by many artists, big and small, as a highly effective marketing tool. The key to SoundCloud success is attracting a robust following of listeners, as more listeners translates into more exposure and better visibility on the site. Of course, attracting a vibrant community of SoundCloud listeners is easier said than done. To successfully attract more listeners and improve your odds at success in the hyper-competitive music industry, be sure to check out these seven tips. 1. Use SoundCloud Ads You can always advertise your tracks with SoundCloud to expand your reach. SoundCloud Ads, which can be purchased by artists, include a mixture of a radio-style audio ads, display advertising on mobile, and native advertising. Thousands of artist have used this method of promoting their tracks with a lot of success. However, ads can get expensive. Very expensive. The average SoundCloud promoted track campaign can run you up several thousand or even tens of thousands of dollars. This option is usually out of reach for most new and upcoming artists, so lets move on. 2. Post on Music Forums and Subreddits To get more listeners, you need to spread the word about your SoundCloud profile. The easiest way to do this is to post links to your profile on relevant forums and subreddits. There are tons of forums and subreddits out there dedicated solely to music, and many music lovers utilize these as resources to find new artists. Do some research to find the most relevant forums and subreddits in your niche, and start posting! 3. Buy SoundCloud Plays There is no denying it: In an increasingly oversaturated music industry, it can be hard for your music to be heard. To boost your visibility on SoundCloud, it is critical that users are playing your songs regularly. The more plays you have, the more visible you will be. If you are struggling to attract listeners, it can be advantageous to buy SoundCloud plays. While it is true that this pretty much equates to artificially inflating your play count, as a result you will garner more real followers. There is a variety of services that offer SoundCloud plays, and prices vary, so you will want to do your research before making a purchase. I have tried very many similar \u2018social media promotion\u2019 services online and the most effective one, I think, is Boost Socials. This service is so good with reasonable prices equating with best quality: all active, no bot, totally legit\u2026 They specially includes a 100% Money-Back Guarantee if they are unable to deliver on time, and a 90 Day Retention Guarantee for the followers they deliver. I believe that they will not disappointed you. Let\u2019s try!!! 4. Use Sponsored Tweets / Mentions It is always advantageous to tweet links to your SoundCloud tracks in order to attract new followers. However, that only limits you to your current fan base. You can gain even further exposure for your music by using sponsored mentions. With sponsored mentions, also known as sponsored tweets, popular influencers get paid to tweet and recommend your music to their massive, loyal following. This will attract a huge amount of targeted attention and listeners quickly and organically. Prices for sponsored mention campaign range from $40 to several thousand, depending on the size and scale. 5. Make A Music Video Songs are great, but music videos are even better. Consumers\u2019 demand for video content is rapidly rising. Sharing music videos on your social media pages with a link to your SoundCloud profile is a highly effective cross-promotion social media marketing strategy. Research consistently shows that video content receives more shares and higher engagement than any other content on the web. Making a music video will also give your fans visuals to remember you and your music, offering much more benefits than just attract more plays on SoundCloud. Hope this help! Good luck!!! der\ufffd\u0002\u001d\u001d\ufffdT. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll start with the obvious qualifying factor: have good content (music, podcast, or beats). The huge traction of listeners comes from you having worthy to share material. The easy to implement tactics: have you SoundCloud links posted everywhere - twitter, facebook, Instagram, TiK ToK (I would definitely do a TiK ToK presence - I do not care about your personal opinion about it, kidding - no really, do it)share the links as posts WITH a story attached - do not just upload and share - adapt the content based on the medium you\u2019re sharing to (Instagram - ad a Story), facebook - tell me something emotional. Another piece of advice on the content - give micro bits of the song - extract a part and TELL me why that is cool. Do not expect people to see the brilliance - point it out. Tell me how you got there, the genesis.The paid versions. You can try Facebook, Instagram on paid as well. Everybody would tell you that. What I\u2019d do is invest (if you have money) in Outbrain. Write a great piece of content (story) on the song as a blog post. Put the SoundCloud link there and promote the Blog Post on Outbrain. Carefully choose the correct title. Be click-bait-ish but do not cheat the audience. Instead of \u201cListen to the best song launched on March 13th\u201d write about \u201cThe behind scene of a song about two Dolphins that are pooping purple diamonds.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": " 1. Upgrade your Account First, let\u2019s assume that you\u2019ve covered the crucial basics on already having a profile for yourself or your band, and you have a professional-looking profile picture or logo as well as a solid and concise bio, and links to your website and social networks. Then, it can be well worth upgrading your account to one of the Pro options. Aside for the obvious benefits of being able to upload more music, it also gives you access to one of the most valuable tools an artist can have: data. Pro accounts give you extensive stats on where your music gets played from, which you can then use to market your music accordingly. 2. Get Exclusive Release your next single exclusively through SoundCloud for streaming. This will allow for your followers, old and new, to listen to your songs exclusively on SoundCloud. Asking them what they think as a comment will help increase engagement, but make sure to show appreciation for whatever constructive comment you receive. If you want a different kind of exclusive release through SoundCloud, consider getting audio recorded from one of your upcoming live shows and promote an exclusive live track or EP through the platform. Be sure to tag any music that you upload onto SoundCloud. Use both specific tags (like \u201cglam rock\u201d or \u201cshoegaze\u201d) and general keywords (such as \u201cacoustic\u201d or \u201cpiano\u201d) so that listeners will be able to discover your music based on their interests. Additionally, if you decide to post a cover or a remix of another artist\u2019s song, you will draw the attention of the other artist\u2019s fanbase, and hopefully gain a few more fans, even though SoundCloud\u2019s been clamping down on copyrights lately. Tactics like those will drive traffic to your profile and your fans will follow you there. With the ease of signing up via Facebook, you\u2019ll likely find many of your fans across the internet are already signed up on SoundCloud waiting to flood your new single with listens and follow your profile. Pro users should also draw attention to a specific track they particularly want to promote using the Spotlight feature. Spotlight allows you to pin up to five tracks or playlists to the top of your profile, so that visitors to your profile see and hear that music first, while the rest of your tracks and playlists are shown in reverse chronological order. You can use this feature to highlight your newest release, your singles, or your best songs. 3. Share on Other Platforms Since SoundCloud is a social music streaming service, you can find ways to integrate it with your other social networks. Whenever you post music on SoundCloud, be fervent about posting it on Twitter, Facebook, and any of your other social networks that your fans are actively paying attention to you. Not only will that get your play counts up, hopefully your fans using SoundCloud will interact with you by commenting and sharing your songs on it. Don\u2019t spam every single one of your new twitter followers with a direct message, but tweet about your track and include a link with a call to action if relevant, such as asking your followers to share the song if they like it. 4. Get Social and Engage You are not the center of the SoundCloud universe. Like any other social network, in order to get the most out of SoundCloud you must interact with other users if you want to build an audience. Start by following other artists\u2019 music pages. Comment on their music and repost it if you really dig it. They might just return the favor. Doing this will help you maximize your music\u2019s exposure, build a community around your profile, and get you comfortable using the platform. A word of caution to the wise: While you may be tempted to purchase followers and plays from a third-party service to feel the some immediate satisfaction that comes with having a profile that looks busy, fake plays and followers only hurt your credibility. They cannot interact with you and they certainly cannot purchase your music, merch, or concert tickets in the long run. Following and engaging with other artists is a great way to build up your own following as well as increase the engagement on your profile. Follow artists that you like, but also artists that are in your hometown and those that create similar music to you. They are more likely to follow you back. Whenever possible, establish a connection with them via other social networks as well, and ask them to provide feedback on your tracks. For engaging non-musicians as well, follow followers of people that make similar music to you. By following them, you will attract their attention and indirectly introduce them to your music. In parallel, draw comments on your tracks by asking your followers from your other platforms to comment them. As an example, post a new release on your Facebook Page, and ask your followers to comment on the tracks in SoundCloud. Finally, make sure to always reply to comments by others on your songs. Ask for more information on comments wherever relevant to keep the conversation going. Others will see this activity on your tracks and will be more compelled to join in on the conversation. 5. Join a Group Speaking of community, another way to increase your exposure on SoundCloud and build your audience is by submitting your music to the various groups on the platform. You can find the groups that similar artists belong to and submit your music to be posted on the group. Browse groups in SoundCloud\u2019s search feature, where you can find groups in genres ranging from EDM, to Top 40, to indie rock, to old-school hip hop. Be sensible about how many tracks and how often you post to each group since these SoundCloud users don\u2019t follow you yet (read: don\u2019t spam), and watch as your play counts and followers increase over time. 6. Host a Podcast If you are feeling super creative and want to bring a different kind of content to SoundCloud apart from your music, consider hosting a podcast for you or your band on the platform. SoundCloud Pro Unlimited offers an unlimited amount of space for an affordable monthly price ($15/month). A podcast is a great way for you to connect with your fans about virtually any topic that you think would be engaging. Podcasts give your fans an extra personal look into your life. If you feel like you can\u2019t keep up with an ongoing podcast, consider a short-term podcast while you\u2019re on the road or in the studio to share your experiences and thoughts. Your followers will appreciate even short audio updates on your happenings. Any form of verbal communication should be seen as a conversation. By asking questions to your listeners, you should incite further thoughts and comments by your followers, both from musicians and non-musicians alike. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to get more listeners/followers/plays/likes on soundcloud can be listed in 3 steps. Step 1: Be authentic and as professional as possible. Have high quality tracks, good descriptions and a nice layout (profile pick and banner). Also, make sure your links point to relevant social pages. Step 2: Share your music on your social pages. This one is kind of obvious, but make sure you have a decent social media plan that will help you with that. Your audience should be your target audience and not some random followers. Remember, numbers are not key here, targeted audience is. Step 3: Connect with real people on soundcloud/social. To add to step 2, you should connect to your ideal audience. Don\u2019t just share your track with anyone who starts to follow you, or spam others peoples feed with your music. Connect with them, start a conversation and direct them to your soundcloud page in the end. Also try to find relevant music on soundcloud, the type that you connect with or that your target audience is listening to. That way, you present yourself as a social person and you might open up some conversations that way. A good start. With these 3 tips you could start of already and might find that you will get very good results. You also might want to see if you want to use bots or buy likes or plays. In the end, they are just numbers. It is up to you if you want that or not, but those numbers are not going to buy your album or listen to your music. Have fun and make awesome music!

            "answer_text": "Since SoundCloud is a place for people to listen some of the best indie music from all over the world. Hence, it\u2019s really hard to compete especially when you just getting started to get people to listen to your music. Unlike in the physical world you can put your music in your mp3 and walk around and asking people to listen to your music. You would need to focus on creating the best music content ever. Try to determine you own strengths and weaknesses when creating a new music. You want to optimize your strength and then people will eventually attracts to it. However it\u2019s not wrong to mix it together with other marketing strategies to get people to easily discover your music. One of it you can hire a professional marketing team (Twidium) to promote your music and get you a higher amount of listeners just to get you started. Real users followers will definitely boost your profile to look even more professional, and with that social proof you will attract more people to listen to your music organically. Secondly, tagging your music for success, and be as honest as you can if your music include drums and bass, then you use that and so on. Add also moods and location to your tags, it\u2019s extremely helpful to attract wider audience to your music. Thirdly try to add buy link, meaning to show to your listeners that you mean business. You need to show an act of actual artist that you are making music for a living. You need can get more support this way, if your listeners appreciate the music you are making. This way you can buy their sympathy and get more listeners in the future. Tell a story with your music waveform to tell your community and fans about your music process. Try to be as transparent as you can about how you made your track and ask for feedback and mention specific sections. Last but not least focus on editing and creating the best album art for your SoundCloud music. IF you track gets embedded on a blog your artwork will be there. If you share your track to Facebook your album goes there as well. Basically it\u2019s the first impression that represents your aspect of music even before people click play to it. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, guys~ Music is your passion. If you like, you can spend all your time writing and performing. But if music is also your business, you have to leave the studio and do some leg work to promote your music. So we found our music contacts in the SoundCloud review to contact some musicians and ask them how to market and promote their SoundCloud music. What they said is below. 1. Create A Marketing Plan In business, it is common practice to state your goals, identify target markets, and then develop products that meet the needs of the markets. As a musician, this strategy is as important to you as any CEO. Understand the personality and habits of an ideal fan. Do they go to the club or the music festival? Do they prefer to hang out in rooftop bars, or do they like to sit on the sofa in the backroom and listen to music with a few friends? Do they listen to music at work, exercise, relax, or get together with friends? As a musician, it is likely that how you consume music is similar to the way your potential fans like them. It's important to ask and answer these questions, so when you put music there, you know how to most effectively target people. There are great ways to get to know your potential fans: \u2013 Participate in performances by similar local artists or view their followers' profiles online. \u2013 If you already have a small fan base, please survey your audience to learn more about them and ask them how to find you. \u2013 Look around the forum for people who like your music and join the conversation. \u2013 Browse YouTube videos of your favorite bands and see what people say in comments. Look at other bands associated with you and see if any of them are playing in the near future. Go mingle with their fans! Ultimately, you should be able to create so-called marketing roles. This is just a template to aggregate the profile of your average listeners. You always want to be as detailed as possible - so far, if you can use your research to create a fictional \"average fan\" for yourself and give him or her a name, you are golden. Once you know who your target market is, you can start targeting them where they are. 2. Know Where Your Target Market Is This leads to the next point: Where is your target market, both online and offline? Once you know more about who your potential listeners are and their habits and demographics, you can figure out where they are looking for music. There are many places to find potential fans online. For example: \u2013 SoundCloud (obviously) \u2013 Mixcloud \u2013 YouTube \u2013Spotify \u2013 Reddit The best part of online viewing is that platforms are often social, so you can see not only what potential fans like, but also where they live, what they do, and how they interact with the web. Mining data, because the more you have, the better you can locate. Your fans may also follow tastemakers. DJs were the original tastemakers in the world of popular (and alternative) music, but more and more bloggers are taking over that role. Look around for bloggers, online DJs, and even playlist curators. 3. Promote Your Music on Social Media Once you have prepared your promotional materials for influencers and fans, you are ready to use all that. You\u2019ve set your goals, identified potential targets, and gathered data. Now it\u2019s time to take to the (social) streets. As mentioned above, if you\u2019ve got the savvy and the manpower, you should be on social media. That doesn\u2019t mean that you should be on all of them, and that doesn\u2019t mean that you should pick one and hang out on it just because it\u2019s Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/whatever. Pick a social media platform that you\u2019re comfortable on, but where your potential fans are, too. One of the great things about SoundCloud is how friendly it is to other social media sites. SoundCloud allows you to link your website, but also to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube, and Instagram. This way, you can be active on social media, while letting your SoundCloud profile be your main base. There are countless ways to engage on social media, both on your own profiles and on others\u2019. For example: \u2013 Use your social media to drive engagement. Ask questions, make polls asking what your next album should be titled, crack jokes, and ask for shares, retweets, and reposts. Harner some organic buzz with hashtags and behind-the-scenes pics. \u2013 Make use of free downloads, discounted merchandise, tickets to gigs, and other incentives. Offer these in exchange for email sign-ups or as rewards for remix contests. \u2013 Engage people. Hold contests, offer giveaways or meet-and-greets, or backstage passes for your next gig. \u2013 Basically, if you were your ideal fan, how would you want an artist to reach out? Social media is a great tool for growth. You can talk directly with your fans! For every hour you spend outside going to gigs and meeting fans in person, spend an hour online to get to know people better. The more people you talk to, the more fans you\u2019ll get! 4. Use A SoundCloud Marketing Company You\u2019ve done planning, and you\u2019ve started creating a buzz online. Awesome! But before you blow up, you\u2019ll need to build yourself up with some numbers. It\u2019s easy for a quality artist to get lost in the sea of any social media platform because he doesn\u2019t have a following already. This doesn\u2019t mean that his music isn\u2019t good, it just means that when people see tracks with low play counts, reposts or comments, they\u2019re more likely to judge quickly and hit Next. Buying plays, in small increments, throughout this entire process will help. By doing this, you make sure your new traffic doesn\u2019t fall on an empty profile. Buying social proof as you promote yourself makes it look to your potential fans like you\u2019re growing organically \u2013 and will push them to follow you, too. And this doesn\u2019t just mean buy plays, followers, and reposts. For the best results, give yourself a social boost across all your social media to become a true online sensation. This is a trick that many musicians have used before, and if it\u2019s done correctly (meaning, at the same time as a bigger plan like the one we\u2019ve outlined so far), it will work. This is one of the reasons we built this site \u2013 so you don\u2019t have to worry about being scammed or buying spam. We\u2019ve gone through and tested SoundCloud marketing companies. You can read its reviews here - AIOStream Review, and know that we stand by each one of our recommendations.  AIOStream is an amazing music marketing software. It has been proven to effectively increase your song likes, views, and follows within a very short time. It was created by the WhiteHatBox team for music in the US and has grown in leaps and bounds to have over 100 million users today. 5. Get Into the Data If you want to locate a target population in a certain area, you can go to that area and look around. When you're online, things get more complicated - that's where analysis and data entry comes in. The easiest way to get data on SoundCloud is to go Pro. SoundCloud places upload restrictions on free accounts and don\u2019t let artists access any data. That changes with Pro, as you get more upload time as well as usage and traffic data. If you can afford the $7 or $15 price, this is one of the easiest ways to gather listener data. If you don\u2019t want to pay for SoundCloud Pro, or if you\u2019re just looking for another way to access data, then you can always use the analytics dashboards of AIOStream, YouTube, or Google Analytics. AIOStream has a super-smart data management function that let you can add, import, set, and use any type of data with the functions in these sites. YouTube will only give you data about your YouTube channel, but this can be valuable because you can see what else your fans listen to, and how much of the songs they hear. YouTube can be useful for more granular song insights, but a drawback is that it\u2019s only good for YouTube. You\u2019ll only be learning about fans on YouTube, not your fans on the internet at large. Similar to YouTube is Google Analytics. This is one of the most powerful free analytics programs out there, and if you set it up on your website, you can get endless insights from it. It's not hard for music to succeed. It just takes a little work. Follow these tips to promote music on Soundcloud, and you'll be able to expand your visibility online and offline. In Retrospect: 1. Create a marketing plan that lays out your goals, so you know what success looks like. 2. Know where your target market is by looking around and getting a solid idea of who your potential fans are. 3. Promote your music on social media so you can start creating an organic buzz online by engaging fans. 4. Use a SoundCloud marketing company to get you your initial dose of social proof, so your online profiles look good to your potential new fans and tastemakers. 5. Get into the data with SoundCloud Pro, Google Analytics, and other analytics platforms on social media. ",

            "answer_text": "Tag Your Music The first major way that you can use to increase the exposure that your music receives is to tag it with the proper labels. SoundCloud makes this easy too. In fact, the tag feature on SoundCloud is quite similar to the hashtag feature found on Instagram and Twitter. Simply choose relevant tags for your music and add them to your track. Allow Users to Buy Your Music Another great step to getting discovered on SoundCloud is putting a link to purchase your music. Sure, listeners can be listed for free on SoundCloud. You will be surprised how many people purchase music if you have a decent following. Fans like to support independent musicians, but they do need some encouragement. This is increased even more when you buy Soundcloud followers. Comment on Your Waveform The waveform is the graphic that appears under your music as a song plays. You have probably noticed that SoundCloud users can comment at a particular time on your waveform. This allows them to make comments about a specific moment in your song without having to specify the timestamp. Use Stunning Album Art Stunning album art is a great way to get discovered on SoundCloud. Seriously, this is the same as using a catch thumbnail on YouTube. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been running a label for over a year now and all of our most valuable exposure has come from influential blogs and channels that are respected within the industry.  If you follow certain promoters and know what style of music they release then you can contact them when you have a release that suits their vibe. Its not all about the plays on your own Soundcloud account either. If you give a blog or channel an exclusive they will post your track from their own account which means you will get loads of plays, comments and likes but only on someone else's account. The important thing to consider is your end game, what are you trying to achieve from getting loads of listeners? Most people want to sell more records or get more gigs ect, which means you need a strategy in place! It might be as simple as getting peoples email address and building up your core fan base but whatever it is make sure it is easy for people to do. ie: have a link to your subscribe page.  Your raving fans are much more valuable than the mass plays, likes and comments. Check out this great article from Kevin Kelly for more on this subject: The Technium: 1,000 True Fans  Here is a link to a track as an example from our label page: Chute - Obsession (Radio Mix)  ",

Did you know with 200 million users this is exactly why it\u2019s important to have a great looking SoundCloud profile to stand out from the crowd? In this post, I will cover a few things to make sure your profile has. 1 - Your profile image needs to be 1000x1000 pixels, this allows your to zoom into the image and still have a quality and a clear photo. 2 - Text should be kept at a minimum leaving the majority of the banner to visuals and attractive imagery. 3 - Your profile picture, your photos and visuals on your banner need to have consistency. Same fonts and basic color palette. 4 - Stay away from blurry images or images with watermarks. By following the steps we\u2019ve laid out for you above you are well on your way to making a striking SoundCloud page which means more listeners to your awesome music.
