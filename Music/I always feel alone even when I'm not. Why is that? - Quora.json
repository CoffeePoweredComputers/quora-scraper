            "answer_text": "You feel this way because you are wise enough to recognize that ultimately it is impossible for any human being to fully connect with another. No matter how close you get to those near you, you can only share moments, when your life is so much more that moments. No person is completely understood by anyone else, ever. We are all alone. You can do nothing to change this reality, so your choice is how you want to respond to it. Religion offers hope that though no human has the capacity to fully understand and relate with you, a benevolent deity might. I personally prefer Christianity, but you have several to choose from. If your mind recoils from the idea of trying to relate to a deity that can never be proven to actually exist, then you can try other things to get your mind off of it; perhaps try to build close relationships with others, and see how close you can get to real understanding. Or, you could seek out physical solitude that matches your mental world, and become a hermit, living off the grid. Those are suggestions, but what I found really helped me when I reached the same point in my mental and emotional development was asking the question \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Do you need to be fully connected in order to find love, to enjoy friendship, to share sorrow? I find the answer is no. I have never truly known anyone, but I have truly loved twice, two wonderful women who stayed mysterious and exciting because I never knew just what they thought or felt about things. I have shared sorrow with strangers, not because I could relate, but because humans have the capacity to mourn with those who mourn. And I have found friendship where I least expected it, by being open to the idea that each person is who he is for reasons that are hidden from me, but meaningful to him. I don't have to understand why a person is who he is in order to enjoy his company, the mystery makes the company that much more enjoyable. It isn't all bad, being alone in your soul. It keeps a bit of magic and fear in relationships, ensuring that the stakes stay high, and forcing you to actively treat others with care and respect. It adds humor from misunderstandings and surprises. It keeps things interesting. So, you are alone. Who's to say that's not a good thing? ",

            "answer_text": "If you feel alone, even though your are not\u2026 then I suspect it is your subconscious bringing up this feeling\u2026 This is called a psychosomatic event\u2026 the subconscious mind is focusing on an unresolved, or unprocessed past experience\u2026 and so it just brings up the emotion to get your attention\u2026 here is my video on psychosomatic events. I am an Emotional Researcher, in this video I discuss Psychosomatic issues, and how the technique I discovered helps stop the Emotional Disturbance causing the manifestations.  That book I am holding up is what I use to target emotions. It works on this type of thing. Let me tell you some things about emotions\u2026 this is what you are dealing with. Have you ever heard of Emotional Charge? It is a psychology term for ..\u201dBottled up emotions\u201d\u2026 Emotion means\u2026 Energy in Motion\u2026 so when this energy gets bottled up, it gives us a pressure, and this pressure can build and give us stress. Anger is a stress emotion. So is Hate\u2026 Pain and Hurt as well\u2026and it gives us a shock\u2026if you look at an incident\u2026 there was probably a shock at the beginning of it\u2026 that then changed into your emotional responses\u2026 Loneliness is no different\u2026 later go to my Quora Space page, near the bottom is a post on Loneliness. Watch the video. Now\u2026 The energy of an emotion, has an amount, intensity, frequency, and polarity\u2026 Lonely is seen as a negative polarity emotion, the state of being without companionship, missing people. So, emotions have a Charge\u2026 just like electricity\u2026 and so\u2026 Loneliness would be an Emotional Charge\u2026 it is an Energy Load, on us\u2026 so think of it this way\u2026 it is not Lonely\u2026 it is\u2026 \u201cLonely Charge\u201d\u2026see? The energy we feel, that we CALL\u2026 lonely\u2026 Doing the technique addresses this Emotional Charge. It reduces it\u2026 it lessens, fades\u2026and can stop\u2026 this is observable while you are doing the technique\u2026there are 8 ways to tell the technique is working\u2026one of them is\u2026 FEELING BETTER\u2026 no kidding\u2026 I have stopped my own Loneliness Episodes with the technique, it even works on the emotions of a PAST Loneliness\u2026Shock and negative emotions are stored up in MEMORY\u2026 \u201cbottled up in memory\u201d a reservoirs for emotions\u2026 I have PTSD\u2026 so I deal with Pressure, Stress, Anxiety, Hysteria, Depression and even suicidal issues at times. These are some things the technique works on... #suicidal thoughts, #flashbacks, #panic attacks, #Aggravation, #Anger, #Hate, #Hostility, #sadness, #grief, #guilt, #worthlessness, #hopelessness, #Fears #Stress, #Intimidation, #Shyness, #Worry, #Horror, #Terror, #Panic and MORE. The benefit to a person would be, the technique would take those down for them, and they would feel better\u2026 really\u2026 With my PTSD, I use the technique on all of those emotions listed above. If you would like to know more about Emotional Charge, and the technique, feel free to visit my Quora Space page... just take your time, and go down the list of my posts to one you are interested in... I suggest starting with \"How Energy Affects Us\", and \"What is Emotional Charge\". There are posts on many topics. Check it out. Steve Barham's post in Happiness Is No Charge I talk about the technique and how it can help things on my Space Page\u2026 that is for information\u2026 If you or anyone else, would like to learn the technique, I teach the technique in my book\u2026\u201dTarget Your Emotions\u201d. A book of my 10 years of research, practice and experience with using the technique. If you would like a copy, there are links to my work on the bottom of the Quora Space page. Best Wishes from a researcher who also has the problems he writes about\u2026I live alone, I do the technique, it stops that feeling of loneliness, it is an \u201cemptiness\u201d we feel, and it may not be about what you might think it would be about\u2026 if it is a subconscious event.
