            "answer_text": "Face of the group is usually the member who basically represent the whole group when he/she appear on variety shows etc because they are the most popular member in the group. It\u2019s like when you see this member you will know which group he/she is in Keep in mind that there is a difference between visual and face of the group, being face of the group does not need to be a visual in their group. Some example that are face of the groups Jackson - GOT7  Joy - Red Velvet  Hani - EXID ( in this case she\u2019s both Visual and Face of the group)  Suzy - Miss A (She is also a Visual)  Hyuna - 4 minute  I actually have no idea who is the Face of the group in BTS because the maknae line are all popular so I will name all V, Jimin, Jungkook  ( from left to right : Jimin , JungKook, V) Thanks for the request :) ",

            "answer_text": "The face of the group directly means the visual. The visual's duty is to provide an attractive face to the group but just having an attractive face cannot get you in a group but the visuals are also trained for either singing or rapping or both (sometimes) and obviously dancing. The visual of the group is always the priority to be at the center or near the center for performances and mvs. Like JUNGKOOK from BTS (we all know it) is the visual of the group and there's no cross questioning that and it's not just because of his handsome face that he is at the center but he is also a great dancer in the group but Jin and V are also in the visual line. Jin have great visuals but as he is not that good at dancing so he is commonly found with RM(because they don't dance so well as compared to other members) at the back mainly. V is a good dancer so he is found near JM, SUGA, JK OR JH.  ",
