            "answer_text": "Yes I have shuttled between Play Music and Apple Music. (I\u2019m still holding Apple Music subscription and won\u2019t resubscibe after its expiry in March). The switch from one music service to another is only difficult if you are already deeply invested into the first music service (in terms of playlists curated by you). Else, it is a cakewalk. I\u2019ve had Google Play Music in the past which is good for its machine learning of your music tastes. Now having Apple Music, which is good in terms of human curated playlists. Since I have a Jio connection, it makes sense for me to just not continue Apple Music and start using Jio Music (Apple Music/Google Play Music etc. trump Jio music, because they have more of Global music, Korean, Japanese, Taiwanese etc.), but you can\u2019t go wrong with a free music subscription that comes with your mobile connection and have decent selection of Indian and English songs (Other examples being Wynk being discounted for Airtel subscribers). I\u2019m also an Amazon Prime customer, soon Amazon is going to provide Prime Music in India for Primer customers. So, that is another reason not to have a pure paid subscription such as Apple Music or Google Play Music.. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings, Yes I did. I shifted from Apple Music to Saavn for good. Not because Saavn is the best app or like I wasn't satisfied with the services Apple Music provided. They\u2019re both good. My reason is quite lame and lazy. Although I have an apple ID and I used to purchase songs from iTunes and was also registered with Apple Music. but then I messed something up with my bank account which would now not allow me to make purchases on any online store, which is sad. And I am a little more lazy than what it take to move my ass and get it corrected at bank. So I downloaded saavn (the best in India) and used Paytm to pay for my subscriptions. (Rs. 550/- for 6 months) Things are cool now. Me and JioSaavn (app) are in real love now. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple Music had a strong showing, but like. YouTube Red is directly connected to Google Play Music and gives an incalculable quantity of a content which totally adds free. Google Play Music has the highest adaptability and additional content. You can use Google Play Music for free but are restricted to using radio stations and hearing to music that you have privately uploaded to the google play. On the other hand, Apple Music has no free version According to the adaptability, these services are accessible on most mobile and network devices. Apple Music has the ineffectual mobile compatibility. Google Play Music has web players which give them extra adaptability on practically anything with a web browser, which is not available in the Apple Music. Google Play Music is the best than the Apple Music. Google Play Music definitely has the good interface, but its propensity is showy which requires extra bits. Apple Music has the hardy interface, but its outmoded device and occasionally clumsy accomplishment gave it a disorganized quality. ",
