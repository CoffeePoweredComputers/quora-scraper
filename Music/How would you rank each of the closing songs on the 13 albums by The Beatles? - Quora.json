            "answer_text": "In ascending order: 13) Yellow Submarine In Pepperland. Not even a Beatle song closes out the Yellow Submarine album. They should have simply released the four new tracks as an EP. I was 8 1/2 when the album came out and still felt ripped off. Considering how good the film was, they should have cared more about this project. Feh. 12) Money (great lead vocal by John and those fab backing vocals by Paul and George), but I\u2019ve always felt the backing track lumbers when it should swing (just listen to the original version). And knowing where it sits in their intended discography (as opposed to on The Beatles Second Album), it feels a bit formulaic. 11) Everybody\u2019s Trying To Be My Baby. Bouncy enough track, but it feels like an afterthought. And it\u2019s one of the lesser tracks on Beatles For Sale. 10) Dizzy Miss Lizzy. I actually love this track. But it feels like a tossed off, we-need-one-more-to-fill-the-album kind of thing. Particularly as it is tacked onto Help!, which was their second all-original lp until Miss Lizzy rears her lovely head. 9) Get Back. Obviously a big hit. But it was a big hit a year before it appeared on the Let It Be album. And I don\u2019t like the shortened version. It feels incomplete. Lennon\u2019s tag \u201c\u2026I hope we passed the audition\u201d, does put a sad smile on yer face, though, doesn\u2019t it. 8) I\u2019ll Be Back. Interesting for them in that they didn\u2019t close out A Hard Day\u2019s Night with a raver, and it\u2019s a lovely song, but they should have placed one of the r\u2019n b rockers there and given I\u2019ll Be Back a stronger placement. Perhaps track two, side two? Finishing the album seems to somewhat dull it\u2019s impact. 7) Run For Your Life. A nifty rocker. The lyrics haven\u2019t aged well. George\u2019s fav on Rubber Soul. 6) Goodnight. What a lovely way to close out their magnum opus. One more unexpected stylist turn. In the vinyl era it got lost as many folks chose to skip Revolution 9 and along with that track, Goodnight. The Lennon-penned, Ringo-sung lullaby deserved better. George Martin\u2019s string arrangements is sublime. 5) All You Need Is Love. Magical Mystery Tour was never meant to be a full length album, but Capital hit the nail on the head by filling side two with the brilliant 1967 singles. AYNIS, though released as a single four months earlier, perfectly closes out their Summer of Love era. 4) The End. Not a song so much as a bit and a bit and a bit strung together over two minutes. The middle soloing section rocks mightily and Macca\u2019s parting sentiment is the perfect cherry on the top of their career. 3) Twist And Shout. Has any band ever claimed a cover as their own as the Beatles did with this song? Phenomenal feat. As vibrant and exciting today as was in 1963. That\u2019s 57 years ago. Fifty. Seven. 2) Tomorrow Never Knows. Boundaries broken. Minds blown. The Beatles, along with George Martin and Geoff Emerick reached heights they would only hit again in this fashion once more\u2026 1)A Day In The Life. Perhaps the Beatles greatest accomplishment in the studio. It crossed generations. It obliterated what a pop song could be. It was bigger than anything we\u2019d heard up to that point. Even the snooty music critics of the day could only heap praise. It was important. It was inscrutable. And, like Tomorrow Never Knows on Revolver the year before, it took the preceding tracks on the lp and topped even those. It was (and remains), in a word, magnificent. ",

You know a great-great-GRRRREAT album when you can rattle of opening-and-ending tracks without thinking \u2026 and \u2026 immediately-recognize the album from it\u2019s first three notes (first two if you\u2019re really good \u2026) Three Beatles albums, to me, are at that level: (1) Sgt. Peppers \u2026 the crowd-murmurs \u2026 then first three notes and you have it, right? That iconic beginning \u2026 and, at the end, the infinite-cosmic-chord at the end of \u201cA Day In The Life.\u201d (you only get to play the first three notes \u2026)   (2) Revolver \u2026 the coughing, then just the one-two-three of the initial count-off and you have it, right? And \u2026 the tape-loops at the end of \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d to once again send us into the psychedelic-cosmos at the end. (don\u2019t cheat now \u2026 just the first three notes\u2026   (3) Abbey Road: the \u2018shoop\u2019 and two notes of the opening bongo/bass should do it, right ... three at most. And \u2026 what more-perfect way to end our love affair than with \u201cThe End.\u201d (the song about The Queen is just a throw-away, a \u2018hidden track\u2019) (you only get two notes this time \u2026 did you get it?)   (4) I\u2019ve tried and tried, but can\u2019t leave this one out \u2026The White Album. We all know how it begins \u2026 the taxiing engines of the Boeing 707. And the end \u2026 of course it\u2019s Ringo lulaby-ing us into slumberland with \u201cGood Night.\u201d (the 707 \u2026)   The soothing strings \u2026 Good-Night everyone \u2026  ",
