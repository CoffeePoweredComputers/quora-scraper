            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s an updated answer to this question. We are currently at FL Studio version number 20 (since 2018). Version 12 was released way back in 2015. How can you get FL Studio for free? The short answer is you cannot. It\u2019s not free and never has been. What you can get however is a \u2018free trial\u2019. You can use it for an unlimited time which may create confusion, however features are limited. So it\u2019s meant for testing purposes only. You cannot open FL Studio projects, only save them.Functions such as \u201cclone channel\u201d, \u201csave preset as\u2026\u201d which use the save/load capability won\u2019t work.You can only export to WAV or MP3.The free trial does however allow you to test all the features and the plugins that they\u2019ve created. The full version of the software comes with these licenses; FL Studio Fruity Edition $99.00FL Studio Producer Edition 199.00FL Studio Signature Bundle $299.00FL Studio + ALL Plugins Bundle $899.00All purchases include lifetime free updates. Also if you are a student you may qualify for an academic discount and purchase the \u2018academic/student version\u2019 of FL Studio from a reseller. You\u2019ll find detailed information and relevant download links, etc. from the official developers \u2018Image-Line Software\u2019 website. Thanks for asking! ",

            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s not free, but it comes in various flavours, a student edition, a suite edition and others. Basically the student edition won\u2019t give you all the awesome plugins but you can still commence arranging your music and making melodies. If you don\u2019t want to buy it, you can pirate it, but that means you won\u2019t get all the automatic updates and stuff. Or you could start off with a free DAW like Ardour and then buy FL Studio after attaining some prowess in your production and making some money off of it. ",
