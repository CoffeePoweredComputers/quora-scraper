            "answer_text": "Blue notes are a big part of what makes the blues sound like the blues. Most other American vernacular music uses blue notes too: jazz, funk, rock, country, gospel, folk and so on. In the video below, John Lee Hooker hits a blue note in just about every single guitar phrase.  For such a foundational element of America's music, there's a surprising amount of confusion as to what a blue note is exactly. So allow me to clear it up: a blue note is a microtonal pitch in between a note from the blues scale and a neighboring note from the major scale. Here's a guide to the blue notes in the key of C. C major scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, BC blues scale: C, E-flat, F, F-sharp, G, B-flatC major plus C blues: C, D, E-flat, E, F, F-sharp, G, A, B-flat, BThere are three notes from the blues scale not found in the major scale, in bold above: E-flat -- the flat thirdF-sharp -- the sharp fourthB-flat -- the flat seventhThe flat third and seventh give the blues scale its tragic minor-key feeling. The dissonant sharp fourth makes the blues unsettling and dark. Some people commonly refer to these non-major scale notes as blue notes. That's not right -- they're blues scale notes that still fall on the piano keys. The blue notes fall between the piano keys, between each blues scale note and its closest major-scale neighbor. In the key of C, there are blue notes between: D and E-flatE-flat and EF and F-sharpF-sharp and GA and B-flatB-flat and BTo play a blue note on guitar, like John Lee Hooker does, you bend the strings, making them go sharp. If you're playing slide guitar, you can just move the slide slightly above or below a given fret. It\u2019s no wonder that blues players love slide guitar. On trumpet, saxophone, or harmonica, you can access blue notes by overblowing to make your pitches intentionally flat. You can't play blue notes on the piano, but you can approximate them by playing adjacent keys simultaneously, for example F and F-sharp. Some instruments give you access to the entire pitch continuum: trombone, violin, fretless bass, and of course, the human voice. On these instruments, pitch is continuous, so playing blue notes is as easy as playing \"correct\" piano key notes. On a synthesizer, you can use the pitch bend control, like Herbie Hancock does in \"Rockit.\u201d At about 2:50 in he kicks off his solo with the blue note between the sharp fourth and fifth.  Herbie uses blue notes throughout his synth solo in \"Chameleon\" -- listen around 5:00 - 5:30.  The blue notes I listed are the most commonly used ones, but any microtone can find its way into the blues. Harmonica players sometimes use a slightly flattened C, D or A in the key of C. Guitarists will bend any note so that it's slightly sharp when playing very emotionally and emphatically. Westerners are taught that pitches from outside our system are \"out of tune\" or \"wrong.\" It\u2019s true that if you're intending to play the standard pitches and you miss, it does usually sound bad. But when you play between the piano keys on purpose in musically logical places, microtones can be the most beautiful sound in the world. The Western tuning system is cool and versatile and full of intriguing symmetries, but it gets oppressive after a while. Blue notes enrich our tuning system with glimpses of the infinite possibility of the underlying pitch continuum. Other world cultures routinely use subdivisions of the octave much finer than the Western half-step. Indian and Arabic scales use quarter tones. Klezmer clarinetists bend and stretch pitches like silly putty. Some avant-garde Western composers use their own idiosyncratic microtonal systems to write music that sounds like it's playing on a warped records. That gets to be a little too much pitch freedom for my tastes. I prefer my microtones against a nice steady backdrop of Western equal temperament; they jump out more that way. ",

            "answer_text": "Blues notes (or blue notes) may refer to a pitch that falls in between two notes that are a semitone apart. This means that \u201ca blues 3rd\u201d would be a little flattened third which would cause the note sound between Eb and E (in C major). So this would be \u266dIII but not fully flattened. There is a proper flattened symbol for this half-flattening but I can\u2019t seem to get it here. It\u2019s a mirror image of \u201c\u266d\u201d - other symbol for the same thing is \u201c\u266d\u201d with a slash. If you are after for the notes that make the scale sound bluesy, it\u2019s a little different story. Perhaps the most common blues note is achieved by flattening the V in a minor scale, although many people prefer to sharpen IV instead of flattening V. Don\u2019t worry, the result is the same. So, naturally this would be \u266fIV in minor. In major scale, the blues note is the same in relation to the relative minor scale: \u266fIV of minor scale is \u266dIII of its relative major scale. But it\u2019s common to alter the pitch of III in minor and the pitch of V in major. This is perhaps derived from the fact that many songs don\u2019t have a clear major or minor tonality. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that in major blues the constant \u266dVII is common. It can be analyzed as the Mixolydian mode or simply a borrower pitch from the parallel minor. Now we can apply these major\u2019s altered bluesy pitches in a pentatonic scale which looks like this: I - (\u266dIII)III - IV - (\u266fIV)V - \u266dVII. This makes the major pentatonic look a lot like a minor pentatonic, eh? Bluesy songs really like to play with parallel major and minor features. So, in short: bluesy feeling relies much on altering the pitches around III and V. In roman numerals this would be \u266dIII and \u266fIV. However the term \u201cblues notes\u201d isn\u2019t exactly as official as many other music terms, so basically one could call any note a blues note if it made the music more bluesy. ",
