            "answer_text": "No, Boccherini didn\u2019t compose operas - not plural - though he may have composed a single one. Here\u2019s a list of Boccherini\u2019s works for the theatre. G 524: Cefalo e Procri (lost)G 525: Un gioco di minuetto ballabili Op. 41G 526: Ballet espagnolG 527: Interlude to Picini's opera: La buona figliolaG 540: Clementina, zarzuelaG 541: Scene from 'Ines de Castro'G 542: Aria for the opera \"L'Almeria\" (lost)(List of compositions by Luigi Boccherini) Cefalo e Procri may have been an opera - the list isn\u2019t helpful in that regard. (The catalogue compiler needs a refresher course in how to avoid ambiguity. It\u2019s also hard to tell whether it\u2019s just Boccherini\u2019s Aria for the opera \"L'Almeria\" that\u2019s lost, or the whole opera - composed by whom?) There\u2019s another listed work that has many of the characteristics of opera - the two-act zarzuela Clementina, stated in the linked article as being the only complete stage work Boccherini composed. (So is the Ballet espagnol just a fragment of dance music?) He spent a number of years in Spain where zarzuela originated, and the Iberian influence is found in many of his works, such as the popular Guitar Quintet No. 4 with its Fandango finale, and the Guitar 5tet No 9, \u201cLa Ritirata di Madrid\u201d. According to the information in the linked article on zarzuela, it isn\u2019t the same as opera though it includes operatic arias, and even though Boccherini\u2019s zarzuela was composed in 1786 during the Classical period with music that\u2019s firmly in the Classical style, Clementina is what\u2019s technically termed a \u2018Baroque zarzuela\u2019. It was one of the last of its kind to be written. A listener hearing the many excerpts from Clementina on YouTube would be forgiven for thinking it sounds like opera, but it\u2019s actually not one. Here are just a couple of excerpts. Aria: \u00a1Ay de m\u00ed!  Terceto: Huid, corazones  ",

            "answer_text": "Did Boccherini compose operas? There\u2019s always the possibility of another opera of the time being his, or his work not surviving the years, but it doesn\u2019t appear so. Boccherini wrote chamber music. That was his thing, and he did a lot of stuff in the spirit of Haydn. Hadyn wrote some operas, but that\u2019 s just because his patron Prince Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy liked operas a lot at one point. There\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t play Haydn operas much anymore\u2014they weren\u2019t really his thing either. And Boccherini probably was able to tell if he ever heard/looked at a Haydn opera, instead preferring to look to Haydn\u2019s chamber works for inspiration. ",
