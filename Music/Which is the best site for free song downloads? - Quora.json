            "answer_text": "I'm not a computer savvy guy.  I'd have to ask someone else or search the web to find the answer to this question.  At least in one sense.  But I'd like to address this question in another sense.  It has to do with the nature of artists and their art.  If you were to examine a lot of my posts here on Quora you'd find that I share a lot of music videos.  I do this as a way of promoting artist's work.  I'm old school and listen to most of my music via CDs and vinyl recordings.  I purchase these things.  If a given band or individual is well established, like say The Stones or Dylan, I'll buy a used copy of an album.  But if they're a new up-and-coming act I always buy new copies of their material.  This is because I want these acts to get their money.  This is important to me.  You see, if people keep building their music collections in kind of shady ways, that is, for free, they're helping to kill the acts they apparently like. I know people who have built substantial collections without paying a dime for any of the music.  I give them grief for doing so.  It just doesn't make any sense to me.  You acquire an artist's work because, presumably, you like it.  This would seem to indicate that you'd like the artist to continue making music.  But by stealing their work you make it much harder for them to practice their art.  It's kind of weird to claim you're a fan of an artist if by your actions you impede his/her ability to do what made you a fan in the first place. Before you download 'free' songs think about the fact that you may be hurting the person or persons who actually produced it.  When you play a song for a friend and tell them you love it and feel they should love it too, ponder the idea that you should invest a bit in that artist.  By doing so you help that musician make more music.  And remember that if you and a bunch of other people just steals their stuff they may have to stop making songs.  This is particularly important when it comes to newer acts. ",
