            "answer_text": "I took my daughter to see The Reputation Tour in Nashville. Taylor played her first single \u201cTim McGraw\u201d, and was joined on stage by Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. She also did a medley combing Style(from the album 1989)/Love Story/You Belong With Me(both from Fearless). She also combined Long Live(Speak Now)/New Years Day(Reputation),Bad Blood(1989)/Should\u2019ve Said No(Taylor Swift), and We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together(Red)/This Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things(Reputation). This means that (at least at this particular show) she played at least one song from each album, but overall most of the songs were either from Reputation or 1989. That would be pretty much be the norm for any artist with multiple hit albums to pull from. ",

            "answer_text": "During her Reputation tour she would play a secret song for each concert that would be one of her past songs. Each concert would have a different song and they would be acoustic performances on her \"B\" stage. There is (or at least was) a playlist on Apple Music of those songs which could be considered her greatest hits. In her future tours I have no doubt she will do the same by bringing in her old songs mixed with the new. She knows what her fans want and like. ",
