            "answer_text": "Not exactly a household name, but David Lindley is somewhat known for taking very inexpensive guitars, slapping on new strings and pickups, and then creating incredible music from them. Lindley was Jackson Browne\u2019s slide player for many years (and added the falsetto vocals to the live version of \u201cStay\u201d while playing lap steel guitar) and also worked with Warren Zevon. Among guitarists, he is known for having extraordinary touch and depth of musical knowledge. This is a picture of him playing a Sears Silvertone in concert: Photo of musician David Lindley playing a Sears Silvertone guitar in concert - lindley7 ",

            "answer_text": "Eric Clapton is known for using extremely simple setups. Aside from a Vox wah pedal and sometimes a Leslie cabinet, he plugs straight into whatever amp he\u2019s using and gets his overdrive from the gain knob. He had his Strats specially wired so that one of the tone knobs is a master tone and the second is a 25 decibel midrange boost so EC can crank to meat without a footswitch. I wish someone had told me the masters don\u2019t need a pedalboard before I bought a big sky reverb\u2026 ",
