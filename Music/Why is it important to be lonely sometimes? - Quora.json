            "answer_text": "\u201cYou can be alone without feeling lonely.\u201d  We were always alone, but came to realise it when someone very dear (to us) left. Being lonely is not good for anyone but being alone can lead to wonders. If being alone is a choice then you will be happy with it and wanna lead it in a playful manner. But if it\u2019s not, then that\u2019s loneliness. So now, the issue is :- How to be happy being lonely and sail through it ? Life mostly brings chaos and watch us how we gonna deal with it just like a bug in a programme. It will not compile and simulate until you won\u2019t fix it. I am just a 23 year old guy and we all go through this in sooner or later stages of our lives, so here I am sharing my observations and thoughts that how it effects our daily lives. These days everyone wants to look happy , rich , loved and important. We want someone to support us and stay loyal in every stage of our life . When Acceptance become one of our needs , we start craving that when we start loosing it. Let\u2019s talk about Parents. They are the only one who will never break your heart. But these days we all want ducking relationships and couple goals. See, even your siblings,partner,friends will leave you in bad times but only your parents will share the pain of yours. So let\u2019s come back to the topic. Why it is important to be alone (not lonely) sometimes? To avoid emotional vulnerability Being emotionally and physically dependent on someone , gives them the power to ruin you from within. But if you take charge of yourself and start exploring the surroundings and weird people around, you will get to understand that this human race is damn complex and if you rely on one among them, then get ready for a roller coaster ride. Sets you free from trust issues and insecurity. Trust me, you can sleep peacefully without any fear. To focus on your goals, hobbies and passion. I never knew that i could express myself through writing articles, transform my physique within weeks and learn programming. This is because when you are alone you have lot of spare time to invest on yourself and you don\u2019t have to take permission to do that and fear what that other person might be thinking about you and the relationship between you both. Travel anywhere Life is a big journey, you cannot stay at one place and lead a successful life. When you are alone and have big dreams to achieve, then moving on with time would not be a big deal for you. This will not restrict you from making life changing decisions and fear of loosing anyone close to your heart. \u201cCause distance matters these days.\u201d To be different and not to follow the crowd blindlyWe all are surrounded by couples and they make you feel that being in a relationship is so beautiful , right? Then why do people cheat in relationships?Why do people prefer hook ups?Why do break ups happen all of a sudden after long considerable amount of time staying together ?Why someone leaves another for somebody else !!?The society made this stereotype that being in a relationship is the only way to prove your worth and importance. And it\u2019s the only way to be happy. Actually those who are self reliant and happy by themselves are the happiest people on this planet. One of my favourite Hollywood actor (Jake Gyllenhaal) prefers to stay single and we all know this guy is doing wonders with his work.  Jake Gyllenhaal (38 Years) Some of the other reasons to stay alone and happy:- Talk to anyone without hurting someone\u2019s feelings and trust.You can come back from work anytime.Manage your money well.Keep your parents with you and take care of them.Have peace of mind.Spend time in silence.No need to make other person happy.No fights and misunderstandings.Cook and eat whatever you wish for.No one will complain about your laziness.Can have pets and enjoy their company.(There are so many reasons and I cannot list them all :p) NOTE: The above mentioned points are my personal views and thoughts. Hence no offence to anyone :) Image credits : Google ",

            "answer_text": "So, as I see it there's two ways to be alone. The first is being\u2026 well\u2026 alone. Alone meaning - no other human interaction.  In which case, the benifit would be learning to love yourself. There are plenty of people that wouldn't be able to last 5 minutes in a room with their thoughts. I wish I understood the importance of self validation at a younger age. I wouldnt have been as much of a \u201cintrovert\u201d. If you notice people with lots of pure confidence dont mind being alone\u2026 it's because they love themselves. Which impacts them in a bigger populated environment where they'd care less of what anyone thought. I should be more specific in that sitting alone playing video games, watching TV, or what have you\u2026. wouldn't qualify as confronting yourself. Do yourself a favor and go for a small hike by yourself. The second version of being alone. Pick up your bags because we're leaving. Alone meaning- by oneself, in that noone else is familiar or known.  Go ahead, save some money\u2026 go across the world\u2026 across the states. Go somewhere far away from familiarity, family, and friends. Put yourself in a crowd, find yourself. Find out who you really are when your past doesnt bare the burden of judgment. Where reality isn't subjugated by your parents any longer. You, by being alone without your support system and small town friends are thrown into the thick of it. Maybe your more outgoing? Maybe your loud? Maybe you just want to retreat into your hotel room. In which case, I'm going to be the one to tell you to get off your butt and go be alone in the big world!  All we have in this life is ourselves for certain. In a Stoicism standpoint and in conclusion. We cant control the world, but we can control the friend we are to ourselves. That alone is a powerful tool, and so are you alone. ",
