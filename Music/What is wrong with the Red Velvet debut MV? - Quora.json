            "answer_text": "Though the music video and the song is extremely lighthearted and sweet, if you look closely in the music video, you\u2019ll find controversial pictures of the bombig of Hirsoshima and Nagasaki as well as the 9/11 attacks.  It was immediatly taken down after the Japanese media reported it and S.M. responded with this statement: \u201dAfter questioning the director, we found that he simply used a collage source for the images, and there was no intention behind it.\u201d The video was then uploaded back up again with the inappropriate pictures edited out: \u201dAs SM wasn\u2019t able to catch it before, we will remove the material that caused the misunderstanding as soon as possible. We will make sure not to let this kind of thing happen the future.\u201d  Anyways, now there is nothing wrong with it. Happiness is still an amazing debut song (fun fact: Irene doesn\u2019t fall it there debut song. She calls Ice Cream cake there debut song because it was the first song all five members, with Yeri, were in). peace\u270c\ufe0f ",
