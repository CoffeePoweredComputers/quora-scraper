            "answer_text": "U.S. perspective: Due to a quirk in copyright law, no audio recording of any kind will enter the public domain before 2037. Audio recordings got their copyright protections established in the 60s, and were given a full term, even if the recording was old. Perspectivein other countries: For copyright duration, most countries use a date of 70 years after the death of the creator (95 years if created by a company or group, such as the Philadelphia Symphony). Since today is only 57 years since 1960, no music recorded since 1960 could have entered the public domain yet. A rough ballpark would predict that songs have to be at least 85 years old, possibly older, before it is worth doing research on whether it is now in the public domain, based on recording date. Also, be aware, different recordings have different copyrights. ",
