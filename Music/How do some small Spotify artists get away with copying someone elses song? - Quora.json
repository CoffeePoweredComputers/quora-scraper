            "answer_text": "Nearly all popular songs have what is known as a \u201ccompulsory mechanical license\u201d associated with them. This is essentially a pre-authorization to re-record or \u201ccover\u201d the song, in exchange for a fixed royalty payment to the original artist or subsequent copyright holder. So they \u201cget away with it\u201d by following the law. The distribution service (Spotify in this case) tracks who is owed what share of payment and, when things work right, everybody gets paid appropriately. Legally, it doesn\u2019t matter if the artist is re-interpreting the song (such as an acoustic version of a rock song), or creating a close clone of the original designed to dupe the unsuspecting, particularly where the original artist has declined to allow their music to be available on the streaming services. (Thus the dozens of Beatles knock-offs available on the services dating back prior to the original catalog being released to streaming). So an artist doesn\u2019t make as much money per stream with a cover as they would with an original, but the reality is that a cover will generate so many more listens than an original to more than make up the difference. This is why covers are such a big point of entry for YouTube and other direct-media artists. ",

            "answer_text": "The question I an aswering to is: \u201cHow do some small Spotify artists get away with copying someone elses song?\u201d \u201dcopying\u201d implies a form of plagiarism. The fastest answer could be: since small artists (in Spotify or elsewhere, this is indifferent) have a small amount of followers and streams, they dont draw toi much attention on themselves, also not from the law. Second aspect: a small amount of streams generates a low amount of royalties. So in principle there is no much use, in the poractical world, to initiate a lawsuit against them. It would aonly draw public attention upon them. In the moment in which that copy starts to generate real money, be sure that lawyes will be around \u201cchasing rabbits\u201d. Another important aspect: \u201csomeone else\u2019e song\u201d\u2026 by whom? By another independent artist? In this case, the victim of plagiarism doesn\u2019t have the ressources, nerves, time and energy to chase every imitator. It\u2019s not worth it - again, until that copy earns money. Remember what happened with the Lambada. It was copied. But it only was interesting to start a lawsuit because it was getting increasingly famous. Juan Maria Solare ",
