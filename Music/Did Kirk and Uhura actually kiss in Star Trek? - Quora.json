            "answer_text": "Yes they did! The original Star Trek enterprise TV show was an incredibly advanced intelligent and a wonderfully progressive show that did not shy away from but dealt with the inequalities and issues of the day and times.  Gene Roddenberry was a visionary and He believed in a future where everyone from all different races at missing screens orientation and everyone get along in peace and harmony. It\u2019s one of the reasons why Roddenberry fought so hard to keep Uhura on the Enterprise.  BELE AND LOKAI Many of their episodes and some of the most famous ones center around the pertinent and controversial issues of the 60s including racism to sexism to bigotry, women\u2019s rights etc.. In the episode. \u201cLet that be your Last Battlefield\u201d The Enterpise intercepted and came across two aliens that have one side of their face is painted white and the other ones black. Lokai (Lou Antonio) and Bele (Frank Gorshin), two Cheron males who despised each other. Both had skin that's black on one side and white on the other, but what differentiated them, and served as the root of their hatred, is that Bele was black on the right side and white on the left side, while Lokai was black on the left side and white on the ride side. Even after a harrowing conflict aboard the Enterprise, the two are left on the surface of their decimated homeworld -- a homeworld torn asunder by the same hatred and bigotry roiling within them -- to determine their own fates.  The parallels and showing the absurdity of racism was apparent. Again Rodenberry, almost saw Star Trek and his influence was his responsibility because he was such a visionary and believed in equality for all people. Roddenberry believed in showing people the right way and Equality was the future and the moral and the right way to live. Before the famous episode, \u201cPlato\u2019s Stepchildren\u201dthere had never been an interracial kiss on TV. The TV sensors, who had the final say over what material was appropriate up until this point, had never approved an on screen kiss between two people of different races or ethnicities. As I mentioned earlier, Roddenberry specifically chose a diverse group of actors and actresses to be the model of equality for all. The U.S.S. Enterprise had an African American woman named Nyota Uhura, who was the head of communications. She wasn\u2019t a prop and didn\u2019t portray any of the horrible stereotypes of the day and was a valued member of the crew who contributed just as much as everyone else.  NYOTA UHURA Hikaru Sulu, was an Asian American crew member, who was head of weapons and flight control. The Enterprise was also the first Constitution class starship to have a Vulcan who served as a full Federation member.  HIKARU SULU Even during the Height of the cold war, the Enterprise\u2019s Crew even consisted of a young Russian weapons expert,Pavel Chekov, Who was amazing member of the crew and brought a different perspective outlook and experience.   PAVEL CHEKOV Gene Roddenberry wanted it show Star Trek she make history and to break barriers and show people that they should not fear what they don\u2019t know. but he had a figure a way to get the interracial kiss past the censors.  \u201cPlato\u2019s Stepchildren\u201dSeason 3, Episode 10 Original air date: November 22, 1968Stardate: 5784.2  ALEXANDER GREETS THE ENTERPISE CREW Captain\u2019s log. The Enterprise responds to a distress call from an uncharted planet, one on which Spock\u2019s sensors detect no life. They are greeted by a very short humanoid named Alexander, who provides a massive infodump about how they are the Platonians, and they travelled to Earth during the height of Greek civilization after their own sun went nova, and then colonized this world after Greece fell. They apparently follow Plato\u2019s teachings, and Parmen, their current philosopher-king, calls them Plato\u2019s children, though Alexander thinks it would be more accurate to call them Plato\u2019s stepchildren.  PARMEN AND PLATO\u2019S CHILDREN The episode first aired on November 22, 1968, and is often referred to as the first interracial kiss on American television. this claim has been disputed by some other pression companies and actually I\u2019m going to give you some examples of an interracial kiss that took place even in Star Trek itself in a previous season. But I digress.   CAPTAIN KIRK AND LIEUTENANT NYOTA UHURA This claim is disputed by some who contend by some who contend that in the scene in question, full lip contact between William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols did not occur, as the actors turned their heads away from the camera at the last moment to present the illusion of a kiss, meaning that this scene was not a true kiss.  to me this is playing semantics whether they actually truly live blocked or appear to be doesn\u2019t matter it was how the audience perceived what they say. For millions of Americans from us it was the first interracial kiss on it tv. After attending to one of the sick citizens, The Enterprise crew realizes that there are hoes be a little miss treats and have telepathic until I can I powers to control a dwarf who they make their slave.  CAPTAIN KIRK MENTALLY CONTROLLING ALEXANDER As mentioned above, Alexander, greeted The enterprise crew warmly and also explained that his owners and captures the powers of God\u2018s in control him and he warned me a price for them as well and if they were in danger. by then it was too late and the inhabitants who side of the massage gods trapped the Enterprise crew there and force them to be in town who are in one of the other female crew members for their entertainment. finally in one comedy scene one of their leaders forces against both of their wells Captain Kirk and Lt. Uhura have the first interracial kiss on tv. it past the sensors review and most Americans except in the episode because Deanna Price crew were forced to do it they did it was a brilliant way for Roddenberry to introduce the idea and have people who had never seen an interracial couples kiss for the first time ever.  Eventually Spock figured out that there is something special in the food that they eat that gives these beings powers. Spock and Bones creates a rapid superstrength version and the Enterprise crew gain the same powers and bring justice back to the world and leave the planet. of course this moment in this kiss would go down and make history but they were actually were 2 other previous interracial or controversial kisses that took place before this episode even on Star Trek. I will list the episodes and you can see clearly their dates pre-date Plato\u2019s Children but do not get the credit today that they deserve! \u201cSpace Seed\u201dSeason 1, Episode 2Original air date: February 16, 1967Stardate: 3143.3 Though Shatner and Nichols's kiss is widely regarded as the first interracial kiss of the series, \"Space Seed\" introduced the reoccurring villain \"Khan\" (Ricardo Montanan) who seduces Lt. Marla McGivers (Madilyn Rhue) for his nefarious plot. Part of the seduction being an intimate kiss. This was the first interracial kiss ever on Star Trek.  LT. MARLA MCGIVERS, SHIPS HISTORIAN  KHAN NOONIEN SINGH AND HIS FUTURE WIFE LT. MARLA MCGIVERS  Eventually Lt. McGivers goes native and she tried to help Khan take the Enterpise. When the Enterprise crew foiled Khan\u2018s plans, Captain Kirk decided Khan was too dangerous to be left running around the Galaxy.  So Captain Kirk marrooned Khan his people and his future wife on a tough but hospitable planet.  KHAN AND HIS WOMAN KISSING This was a huge deal because this was an interracial couple kissing on TV two years before the Uhura/Kirk kiss. \u201cWhat are Little Girls Made Of\u201dSeason 1, Episode 7 Original air date: October 20, 1966Stardate: 2712.4 It\u2019s a very strange weird hippy episode but the important thing is if there were two very close female/female kisses and flirting and seduction.  NURSE CHAPEL KISSING LT. UHURA IN THE BACKGROUND There is a longer kiss on the cheek Between Lieutenant Uhura (Nichelle Nicols) and Nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett). Why this female/female interracial kiss does not get mote credit and make more headlines is baffling NURSE CHAPEL AND LT. UHURA SHARING A LONG INTIMATE HUG AND KISS There is also a very close sensual moment between an alien who the Entprise picked up Sherry Jackson played Andrea, a very sexy sultry humanoid. Nurse Chapel Eventually became a regular on the show the only love interest that we ever knew about before this episode was that she had a huge crush on Spock. In this episode, we actually meet her fianc\u00e9. Nurse Chapel had never been this sexual in any other episode. The Enterprise encountered and finally met Nurse Chapel\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and weird friends.  RUK, CAPTAIN KIRK, ANDREA AND CHAPEL\u2019S FIANC\u00c9 But what makes this episode even weirder is that she is This is a very strange episode and Andrea ( the alien) and Nurse Chapel share some very charged hot sexual moments and almost kiss. Very flirtatious and sexy and which is very out of character for her and she and Andrea always have a very sexual deep kiss .  ANDREA  NURSE CHAPEL AND ANDREA  NURSE CHAPEL ALMOST PASSIONATELY KISSES ANDREA Every time I rewatch this episode, I am AMAZED and I cannot believe that it actually passed the censors of the day! Still the most baffling episode to make it past the tv censors. You have a half naked full bosomed hippy inspired girl kissing Nurse Chapel?! I\u2019m surprised dirty John populous wasn\u2019t storming the gates of CBS broadcasting LOL. it certainly doesn\u2019t get the attention it deserves and it\u2019s amazing place in history! Chapel, a white nurse And then there\u2019s this\u2026.  The End?.. ",

            "answer_text": "According to Nichelle Nichols, they kissed, and kissed, and kissed some more during several takes. They also shot scenes where the kisses were fake, but Nichols and Shatner flubbed those takes on purpose so the show had to actually use the real kisses. Surprisingly, there was no uproar back in 1968. Probably because everybody knew the Captain\u2019s reputation of bedding every woman he could, from green to white, to Philllipino, to black and probably a few other colors we don\u2019t even know about. And who could blame him Uhura looked so damn hot in that scene.  ",

I read or heard somewhere that both actors were keen to show an interracial kiss on TV, especially given the civil rights movement in 1960s America, but there was some resistance at the studio or the network which insisted a non kiss version of the scene be filmed as well to avoid upsetting parts of the white audience who were, certainly by modern standards and maybe even by those of the time, racist bellends. Shatner and Nichols filmed all the takes for the kiss version and then deliberately messed up all the others by pulling faces and otherwise screwing around. Pair of absolute legends. ",
