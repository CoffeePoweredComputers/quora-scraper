            "answer_text": "The simplest answer is, we aren\u2019t. Wedding photography isn\u2019t a mere matter of taking a bunch of photos for a couple of hours. There\u2019s the cost and effort associated with running a business, there\u2019s the time spent on meeting you, selling the service to you, travel time, and then editing time (which takes about as long as everything else combined) as well as time to spend culling your images so that the ones we deliver are the ones you\u2019re going to love. If your photographer works for a full day, 12+ hours, you\u2019re looking at maybe another 24 hours to get the editing and culling done. And there\u2019s probably another 10\u201320 hours of marketing, research and sales in the mix that wound up being the result of a single wedding shoot. So what\u2019s fair to pay someone doing, let\u2019s say 72 hours worth of work? Well, minimum wage in Ontario is $14/hr. If you multiply hours by that rate, you\u2019re looking at about $1000 Canadian to pay a person minimum wage to shoot your wedding. Now, take the guy who has no experience in shooting weddings out of the back door at a McDonalds, have him do your wedding photography. That\u2019s worth $1000. Straight up. Unskilled labour costs $1000 for 72 hours of work. That\u2019s just plain fair. But we aren\u2019t talking about a 14 year old who is trying to save up some money for a fun summer, are we? No, professional photographers have families. Children. And they have something the McDonald employee doesn\u2019t: skill and experience. Now, consider that a photographer has to make enough money to support a family, put food on the table, puppy chow in Fido\u2019s bowl, pay a car loan, pay bills, mortgage, etc. Then remember that when you pay that photographer, 1/3rd of the money you pay them is pocketed by the government as income taxes, and another third is spent by the photographer on social media advertising, business insurance, internet access, a website, a dedicated phone line for their business, equipment repairs, equipment upgrades to keep themselves relevant, all that money they earn is basically spent on getting you some nice looking photos, and what\u2019s left for them to feed their families with is the remaining third. Feed, clothe, shelter, transport, etc. If you paid a photographer $3000 to shoot your wedding, you\u2019ve taken advantage of them. Wedding photography isn\u2019t cheap for the photographer either.

            "answer_text": "Considering that the average photographer spends 20\u201340\u201360 hours per wedding to meet potential clients, photograph engagement & rehearsal shots, sometimes bridal showers, the ceremony, the reception, then to sort and edit and optimize the work files; they make about half of what a car mechanic makes per hour, or one-third of a plumber or electrician. Plus investing tens of thousands of dollars in equipment. Then they have spent (usually significant) time and money on technical and craftsmanship education as well as business education. They have the hardest job in photography, like shooting the super bowl every time you go out. So, I think they are a great deal, no matter what they charge, for what the have to do to make the images people expect. ",
