            "answer_text": "I read up on Hillsong Church a little. Pentecostal. Mega church. Say no more. You say something is missing? You are dead right. I'm not an atheist. I'm a Catholic who holds a firm belief in God. But I know that Protestant Churches don't use God to keep you on coming back. They use feelings. Sensational music, spiritual 'highs', dancing, singing! With you feeling so good, you keep wanting to come back! Especially, especially, those megachurches that focus more on being, well..mega. And mega needs cash. Ask any devout Catholic, 'What do you think is missing in Protestant Churches?', and they'll answer: The Eucharist. Take the Pope away, take all the teachings away, the pedophilia 'scandals' (I use quotations because more and more of these are fabricated and have no inkling of evidence.), you're left with the center of Christianity. The center-piece. The core. Jesus.   And in Hillsong, where is Jesus?  When you go to Church, you go to worship and sing to God. But tell me, this is God. Are the songs for him or for you? I can assure, he doesn't need your songs. He doesn't want your songs. So if the songs aren't for him, then that's one aspect of Hillsong that isn't Jesus-centered.  Conferences? That's not Jesus. That's learning about him, sure. But even die-hard atheists learn about Jesus.  Sermons? Go to Hillsong and step into another Protestant Church, and you'll find a completely different sermon. Something is definitely wrong. God is eternal and unchanging. What I'm seeing is changes when you cross the street. What I'm trying to reach is that God is missing at Hillsong. I don't mean he's not there. I mean the entire congregation isn't thinking about him. Amongst all the pomp, glamour, sounds and high-feels, there's no time and place to focus on Jesus. And here, I'm going to quote a Cardinal I hold in high regard, Cardinal Sarah: 'Silence is necessary in the Liturgy.' I'm rambling and deviating, so let me just end it: What's missing is the Eucharist. The body and blood of God incarnate. Catholics go to mass not to listen to the Sermon. Not to sing. We go for the Eucharist. And without the Eucharist, something will always be missing.  ",

            "answer_text": "I have been attending Hillsong church for at least 5 years. In my experience, yes it is a big church and people generally need to make more of an effort to plugin. It is very easy to become a consumer at churches like this where you just attend the service and then just hang out with friends afterwards. Soon enough you may find yourself disenchanted. We moved from the Hills campus (where we were in mostly consumer mode) to a smaller extension in Brisbane city with around 300 people. We made an effort to volunteer (Welcome Team). This was very fulfilling for me. We were now doing the Lord\u2019s work. We were serving him and sacrificing our time and effort. In addition, we were incredibly blessed with an amazing connect group. I also involved myself with helping facilitate the Alpha course at church. All in all, it was a very fulfilling experience. Now I am back at the Hills campus in Sydney and can't wait to plug back in. Sitting and serving (at any church) is very fulfilling and you will no longer look to the church and all its glitz and glamour to fulfil your expectations in attending a church. A church is a gathering of the saints. The saints gather to edify each other and help each other out. A smaller church does make it easier to be ministered to. But it is possible in a bigger church - just that you need to make more of an effort. Besides, Hillsong also does Connect Groups i.e. Small Groups. In my opinion, this is a very important aspect of church. This is where people can help each other more on a personal level. As for the leadership at Hillsong Church, I can speak for the Hills campus. I love the pastors there. My favourites being Robert Fergusson, Sam Di mauro, Joel A\u2019Bell. Brian Houston has great leadership qualities. They are all clean and their fruits (of the spirit) are good and getting better. Sure there are slips up in the general church say London, NYC but overall I think they are doing a good job. It\u2019s a place where I would love to invite others to come and see. Hope this helps. ",
