            "answer_text": "Real music enthusiasts would, I think, never stop listening to music. The burdens of life may force people to change their habits as they age but I think it would require a hell of a burden to make them stop listening to music. There are new dynamics that change our habits and means of listening to music. I think the human race is under a strong negative impression of social media. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter made us get accustomed to brief content. Maximum a few words or sentences long of information along with a photo, or a video, or a gif. People cannot tolerate reading a book or listening to music anymore because it takes too much time. They rather prefer reading famous quotes of famous authors from social media rather than reading a book. The situation is similar for music. There is an interesting statistics I have read about people\u2019s habits of listening to music from streaming services. Many of the songs on Spotify are skipped in the first few seconds. Although people pay money to these services on a monthly basis, most of what they do is to skip most of the songs they listen to. This has also changed how music is composed. Since musicians are getting paid as their songs are streamed for a minimum amount of time, the average length of music pieces has also decreased. Musicians want you to keep listening to their songs before skipping to the next song. The intro parts of music pieces were also shortened so that listeners would not feel bored and skip the songs. You can read more about such statistics in the links below. How streaming affects the lengths of songs One-quarter of Spotify tracks are skipped in first five seconds, study reveals These listening habits we have developed are a result of not only low-quality content but also our intolerance and impatience to see more, hear more, view more.
