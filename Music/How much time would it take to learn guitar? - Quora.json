            "answer_text": "You asked a really interesting question\u2026 So I\u2019m going to give a somewhat \u201cinteresting\u201d answer. I hope you\u2019ll read it to the end. How long does it take to master \u2018a\u2019 guitar? Not \u2018the\u2019 guitar in general. I started out as a drummer, but as circumstances would have it, a good friend of mine was a drumming prodigy\u2026 so I decided to move to (what I thought was the second best instrument in a rock band) guitar. I play a Les Paul mainly, an electric guitar made by Gibson. I bought it 2nd hand when I was 16 with every cent I ever earned. In my world, a new skill is something to be conquered, a quest, a challenge. The guitar was a huge challenge. I badly wanted to be in a rock band with my friends so I set about putting all my spare time into mastering \u2018the\u2019 guitar\u2026 literally. If I wasn't doing schoolwork or class, I was playing the guitar or practicing. Playing meant jamming on songs with my drummer friend. This was important because I learned the value of playing guitar in an ensemble (I was also a percussionist in the high school orchestra). Practice meant learning the techniques and theory as applied to guitar\u2026 chords, scales, picking exercises, learning songs, developing a vibrato, playing along to songs on tape, recording myself playing to hear how awful I was and what I had to work on. 10 hours a day would be spent practicing. There were so many things to know! Things outside of plain old theory\u2026things that make a guitar player sound good. This was during the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s when being a guitar player meant you had to \u2018shred\u2019. I was learning the most challenging songs of the day\u2026 It was constantly pushing myself beyond the normal limits of learning that made me advance quickly as a guitar player. I didn't take lessons because I just figured they would slow me down. By the time I was 19, our band was playing paying gigs in bars. Playing classic and modern rock songs\u2026 and we were pretty good. Had I mastered the guitar by that point? Nope, all of that practice and playing had me at a pretty advanced level of playing a certain genre of music on \u2018a\u2019 guitar\u2026The Les Paul. This guitar, mind you, is a powerful beast of a guitar, but a simple beast\u2026 6 strings, two humbucker pick ups and a lot of heavy wood. By the time I hit 21 years old\u2026 I had mastered \u2018a\u2019 guitar in 1 style of music. I was a pretty decent shredder/blues player\u2026 I could play almost anything I wanted to and imitate the popular players of the day. If you put a steel string flat top in my hand\u2026 I\u2019d be lost. I can\u2019t entertain anyone on an acoustic guitar. If you played country chicken pickin\u2019 style, I\u2019d be lost\u2026. if you wanted me to play Jazz\u2026 I\u2019d be lost! I was a 1 dimensional player. I could be exciting on one stage with \u2018a\u2019 guitar\u2026 a simple Les Paul. 29 years later, I still play the same guitar and I have branched out into other musical genres; somehow though, I don\u2019t feel like I have mastered \u2018a\u2019 guitar like the Les Paul, there are always secrets to uncover. Jazz is my new love and I feel like the time is right to try and conquer \u2018a\u2019 simple acoustic guitar. Not a classical or flamenco, which appear to be the same thing to the uninitiated\u2026 A simple small bodied, steel string Gibson L-00. Joe Pass said, \u201cGuitarists should be able to pick up the guitar and play music on it for an hour, without a rhythm section or anything.\u2019 I hope the next 25 years is enough time\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "A lifetime. I\u2019ve been playing for fifteen years now, but I still feel like a beginner when I watch and listen to the performances of guitar players I admire. However, if I were to go back to the days when I first begun learning guitar and happened to stumble across my future self jamming away with my band I\u2019d have been awestruck. This guy can play the opening to Paschendale by Iron Maiden - he\u2019s incredible, I might think to myself. Oh man, he can play barre chords and make them sound good. There was a time when playing a barre chord seemed flipping impossible; fingerpicking was akin to witchcraft. I remember the first song my first-ever band played was Wake Me Up When September Ends by Green Day. (Also the song with the longest intro ever - skip to 1:40.)  I felt so damn cool at that point in the song when it switches from a clean tone to full on power chords. And that guitar solo? Man - I was awesome. Just wish I could play those bloody barre chords properly. I\u2019ve continued to improve and practise my guitar playing - I work hard at it. I\u2019m pleased to say that I can indeed play barre chords now, but there are plenty of things on the guitar I can\u2019t do and would like to. I look at the guitar work of players like Guthrie Govan, Andy McKee, Paco de Luc\u00eda and other great players and think man, wish I could play like them. So I\u2019ll keep practising and learning, and I\u2019ll continue to improve. My skills weren\u2019t especially spectacular back in those days of playing lots of Green Day songs with my band, but it was a helluva lot of fun. I truly loved playing with my band - we had a lot of laughs, played some great pub gigs and entered our local battle of the bands competitions. A couple of those guys remain good friends and we continue to enjoy talking about the time we played in a band together. I still love playing now. I really enjoy practising and getting together with other musicians for a jam or band practice. I like writing my own stuff, and I especially love it when I finally manage to play a complicated piece all the way through without a mistake - it\u2019s a great feeling. I hope I\u2019ll still love playing in another fifteen years\u2019 time, and another fifty years after that. (Although, just adding up those numbers another sixty-five years into the future is probably pushing my luck; but, you never know - science and medicine are advancing rapidly, so I may be fortunate.) Don\u2019t think of it as trying to play the guitar \u2018completely\u2019 - you can\u2019t, and you won\u2019t. Enjoy learning and exploring the instrument every step of the way. Aspiring to the lofty heights of the greats is good, but don\u2019t think of yourself as failing all the while you can\u2019t perfectly replicate Jimmy Paige\u2019s solos. Enjoy :-).
