            "answer_text": "Church has been adopting an entertainment model for worship. They also hire musicians who worship music rather than ministering to people. MUSIC should not be a musicians ministry. PEOPLE should be and music the vehicle to that end. Hymns are the music of the people but musicians who entertain either are bored with hymns or can\u2019t show off their mad skillz with hymns and thus turn to contemporary songs they can jam to. Many church musicians and choirs (none of yours) worship music, their instruments or themselves. They use church as a performance venue or a paycheck and music is no longer valued as a tool of healing, education or transformation. The responsibility of the pastor in hiring a musician should not be to find someone with a dozen degrees or is charismatic or talented. Those are nice factors but are the least important. Jesus, for instance, would not qualify to lead a church today. What does he know about administration, filling out budget reports and what college did he graduate from? HR would weed him out immediately. Especially when they find out he used cannabis in his healing ministry. Churches hire musicians based merely on performance value and not vision. Musicians are or should be a vital part of ministering and healing but they can\u2019t fulfill that calling if the musicians are focused on entertaining. But I\u2019m sure it is not like that in any of your churches. So, musicians of today view hymns are archaic and boring. You know, forests and trees. ",

            "answer_text": "Why don\u2019t most churches sing hymns anymore? False assumption. They do. \u201cMost\u201d means more than 50% and given how many Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican Christians there are in the world, no other churches need to be added to the tally to prove the assumption false. Catholics alone are more than 1.3 billion of the 2.4 billion Christians in the world. Those three churches all still sing hymns, so perhaps the OP is only looking at one denomination or one sliver of a denomination like a certain type of evangelical church where praise and worship songs are the norm. New hymns are still being written by people in many countries, so if you don't care for modern worship songs look around and find some alternatives. List of Christian denominations by number of members - Wikipedia Here is one of my favorite hymns written by a friend within the last decade or so. Curtis Stephan is a prolific Catholic composer who has written multiple mass settings, hymns, contemporary praise songs and even an award winning jazz piece. I wish that I could share a recording of our choir singing this hymn live because the studio recording is nice but doesn't truly do it justice as there's too much violin obscuring the vocals. Curtis is our parish music director, and our English choir director is an operatic coloratura Jendi Killberg.  ",
