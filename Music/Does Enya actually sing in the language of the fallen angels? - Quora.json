I seriously doubt that any person alive, have heard Angel speak or angelic music. You do realize that their voices are not like ours. If we were to actually here Angel speak, it might be too much for our brains and ears and maybe even our hearts to take in. I mean with out having a complete meltdown of the body and mind. I think they would have A much different speech pattern than ours. But as I said we would only be guessing. I would like to here them sing, someday. Maybe when the Lord brings me home. I'll get that opportunity until then I'm content with my imagination. That is what he gave us one for. right? ",
