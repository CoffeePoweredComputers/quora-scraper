            "answer_text": "Ed King quit Lynyrd Skynyrd pretty much at the peak of their fame, mainly because he finally got fed up with Ronnie Van Zant\u2019s mercurial ways. Skynyrd had three guitarists \u2014 at that point, King and founding members Gary Rossington and Allen Collins \u2014 but King was an outsider from the start. All of the other band members had grown up in the same part of Jacksonville, Florida, while King wasn\u2019t even a Southerner, but a native of Glendale, California. He was marvelously talented \u2014 that riff in \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d? That was King\u2019s creation \u2014 and he was valued for his abilities as both a musician and a songwriter, but he was never really \u201cone of the gang\u201d. In an interview shortly before his death from cancer in 2018, King pointed to the below photo as being illustrative of his place in the band \u2014 all by himself to the left, with the other guys all standing side by side:  In March of 1975, during a show in Ann Arbor, Michigan, King snapped two guitar strings while playing \u201cFree Bird\u201d, throwing off his performance. According to King, his guitar tech had not been around to change his strings because he had been thrown in jail, along with Van Zant, following an altercation with police. Ronnie didn\u2019t care why King\u2019s strings broke; all he knew was that Ed had fucked up. He unleashed a torrent of verbal abuse on King, including such colorful pronouncements as \u201cyou don\u2019t amount to a pimple on Allen\u2019s ass\u201d. Following the incident, King said he returned to his hotel room, said \u201cwhat the hell am I doing here?\u201d, packed his belongings, and left without a word, leaving his bandmates to wake up the next morning to find out he was gone (and Rossington and Collins to scramble to rearrange the songs to make up for King\u2019s absence). King was ultimately replaced by Steve Gaines in 1976; Gaines would die in the 1977 plane crash that also killed his sister Cassie and Van Zant. King said he visited the cemetery after the crash to pay his respects, and it was then that he discovered that he and Steve had been born on exactly the same day: September 14, 1949. He felt he had dodged a huge bullet by quitting when he did. King would later reconcile with the other band members, and rejoined them when they reformed Skynyrd in 1987, but had to leave the band due to heart problems in 1996. Both he and Gaines were among the band members inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. (For reference: King told this story in Stephen Kijak's fine documentary If I Leave Here Tomorrow: A Film About Lynyrd Skynyrd (2018) - IMDb) ",

Lemmy & Dave Brock 1973  c1974/75 His departure from the band is usually put down to pharmaceutical differences\u2026 his preference was for speed & alcohol when the rest of the band seemed more interested in LSD and hashish. He took the new band name of \u2018Motorhead\u2019 in part as it was the title of a song he wrote for their 1975 LP Warrior at The gates of Dawn, here\u2019s some background to that track and the name.
