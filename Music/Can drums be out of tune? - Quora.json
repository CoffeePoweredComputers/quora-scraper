            "answer_text": "Of course they can be\u2014and I\u2019ve spent years cringing over my out-of-tune drums! But tuning drums isn\u2019t the same as tuning a musical instrument in that you don\u2019t necessarily tune drums to notes on a scale. OK, nowadays people do sometimes tune drums to notes on a scale, and the new tuning gadgets seem to encourage this. It\u2019s also not a terrible idea. However, drums have so many overtones that the notes they\u2019re tuned to (the fundamental pitches or thereabouts) aren\u2019t pronounced enough to cause anyone to think that a drum is in or out of tune from the standpoint of meshing or clashing with the notes on a scale played by other instruments. Tuning drums to notes on a scale is probably more helpful for getting the intervals between different drums pleasing. That is, assuming you have multiple toms, you want the intervals between them to be pleasant. There are different opinions about which intervals are best (and it obviously depends upon how many toms of what sizes you have) but I kind of gravitate to perfect fourths. This gives a nice spread to the different drum tones. Meanwhile, each drum needs to be in tune with itself. At minimum, the top head needs to be tight enough to make a drum sound, which an overly loose head won\u2019t. Then, the tension lugs need to roughly equally tight, and you have to do the same thing with the bottom head. However, with the bottom heads, there are different theories on how tight or loose they should be relative to the top head. Anyway, you spend a lot of time and ear effort trying to get both heads tuned to themselves and to each other in a way you like. And did I say heads? There are dozens of different heads on the market nowadays, and each one is going to have different tonal properties, so you end up buying lots of different heads for both the top and the bottom (not usually the same heads) trying to get the tone you want. And oh, then comes getting the right resonance, which is both a function of the relationship between the top and bottom heads and usually whatever drummers put on top of the heads to muffle them somewhat. This includes various store-bought muffling devices, pieces of tape, a Kleenex, whatever. I also personally find that most drums, especially larger ones, only really sound right with the top head tuned at a tension that gets the tone that sounds \u201cright\u201d for that particular drum. I find that there\u2019s a frustratingly narrow range of tones I can get out of any given drum that sound \u201cright\u201d to me, probably because of the drum size and construction, so I try to find that tone. People who successfully tune the same drum higher or lower impress me because I\u2019m forever finding myself stuck with a narrow range of tones. Enter then the problem that a drum tuned well with itself won\u2019t necessarily mesh interval-wise with other drums in the same kit. This is probably the biggest frustration\u2014and what prompts many drummers to buy more drums or different sizes or stop using one of a conventional size. Throw in that each venue is going to have different acoustics, so however you tuned your drums to one place won\u2019t necessarily make them sound right in another place. True, the basic tuning will carry over from place to place, but fine tuning is usually necessary too. In all, for an instrument that doesn\u2019t have to be tuned in a conventional sense, drums present more complex tuning challenges than do musical instruments. With them all you have to do is hit the right pitch. With drums, pitch can be a helpful guide, but it\u2019s not actually that important and there are a zillion other things that are important. Ergo, people like me often end up cringing over the tones I\u2019m getting out of at least one or two drums because I swear they\u2019re out of tune but I can\u2019t figure out how to get them in tune.

Regardless of the many ridiculous answers I\u2019ve seen on this forum about tuning drums to an actual note, that is not how it works. You tune a drum to get a certain pitch, but that pitch does not have be an actual note. And even if you did tune to a note, it would go flat after being hit only a few times. The main focus of tuning drums is to remove unwanted over-tones, and to get the amount of resonance you want, it has nothing to do with \u201cnotes\u201d. That\u2019s why drums are an un-pitched instrument. ",

It is actually far easier to tune a drum to sound good than to tune a drum to be tuneful. Timpani are tuned to a note, and some people think that means that their drums should be tuned to a note. Unfortunately, if you\u2019ve ever tried to play such a kit, you have realized that they probably oughtn\u2019t to be tuned to a note. Mostly, with drums, you want attack. Largest attack is achieved with JAW tuning (just-after-wrinkling), and, in my opinion, this is where you should always start. Single-head drums. If you have double-head drums, most of what eventually makes it out of the drum is due to the second head. In this case, tune the first head to JAW (which will excite the second head with no resonance from the first head), tune the second head until it provides the \u2018boom\u2019 you want and then slightly tighten the first head and keep iterating until you\u2019ve discovered the sound you want. A final word: drums are not really \u2018tunable\u2019 in that you can make em any pitch you want; each drum wants to sing and will let you know by sounding AWESOME for one tension arrangement and one only. Also, AWESOME is subjective, highly. ",

A standard tuning on a guitar is E, A, D, G, B, and E. Change that to E, A, C, G, B, and E, and it sounds terrible - because the spacing of the tuning is wrong. Same with drums. It doesn\u2019t matter where you start and finish (you might prefer drums pitched high or low depending on the style of music you play) but the interval between pitch across the drums is very important. So tune your drums for resonance, damping, ambiance (the room) and also for pitch - that way you\u2019ll sound as good as it\u2019s possible (and any crappy sound is then just down to you! :) ) ",
