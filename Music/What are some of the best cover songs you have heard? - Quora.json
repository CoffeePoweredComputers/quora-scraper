            "answer_text": "I am a HUGE fan of covers, and could write about this topic for days, but one thing I love is covers sung by the opposite gender. The obvious dichotomy is so freeing. The song can almost transcend the mortal coil of the singer, and just exist in the realm of words, and melody, and conviction. Here are some of my favorites: \u201cR-E-S-P-E-C-T\u201dOriginal artist: Otis ReddingCover artist: Aretha FranklinComment: It would be a little jarring even today for a woman to sing about the hardship of working all day and being the breadwinner, while just begging for a little lovin\u2019 and respect from her spouse when she gets home at the end of the day; when Aretha covered this song in the 1960s, it was an unknown concept. Yet, she dominated the song with such ferocity and skill that nobody even seemed to notice, much less care.  \u201cValerie\u201dOriginal artist: The ZutonsCover artist: Amy Winehouse This song is about a man who has stumbled across an old girlfriend that he is clearly still in love with. The woman seems to be\u2026let\u2019s say\u2026problematic (putting it mildly), but even still, he invites her over, and seems to be trying to get back with her. Knowing the struggles Amy had in her own life, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that she was drawn to the song more as wish fulfillment in behalf of the woman, and less from the perspective of the man. Anyway, she recorded a studio version of this song with Mark Ronson in 2007, but I\u2019m partial to the messy and acoustic live version she did for AOL:  \u201cJolene\u201dOriginal version: Dolly PartonCover artist: The White Stripes I love angst. I love Dolly. I love Dolly\u2019s version of this song. But I also love punk covers and I adore The White Stipes. Put it all together, and you have the most absurd, but deeply satisfying, cover of \u201cJolene\u201d (an oft covered song) imaginable. In this version, Jack decides to do away with any melodic middleman altogether, and just mainlines the pain\u2014raw and vulnerable. His bleating voice at the end is devastating. And I love it.  Speaking of punk covers, my favorite punk cover band in the world is the only famous one: Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. I love their covers so much that it\u2019s hard for me to pick one, but their 2014 album Are We Not Men? We Are Diva!, they only covered songs by female artists\u2014including \u201cJolene.\u201d However my favorite opposite gender song from them is: \u201cCabaret\u201dOriginally from the musical Cabaret, made famous by Liza Minelli in the 1972 film versionCover artist: Me First and the Gimme Gimmes There is nothing extraordinary about this cover, and probably says more about my musical tastes than anything. Still, I think the song typifies how reckless punk covers are, their inherent and paradoxical comedy and pathos, and why I love them so much.  \u201cTo Make You Feel My Love\u201dOriginal artist: Bob Dylan (of course)Cover artist: Adele This song is pretty gender neutral, but it marked a turning point for me personally: it was the song that introduced me to Adele back in 2009. Good stuff.  ",

            "answer_text": "One of my most favorite cover songs in terms of overall music, concept, and execution is a cover version of the Beatles, \"A Day in the Life\" by a novelty group called Big Daddy.  Big Daddy was a group that recorded for the novelty/reissue label Rhino Records back in the 1980s.  The gimmick of the group was that they pretended to be an American rock 'n' roll group that got shot down over Vietnam while on a USO tour in the early 1960s.  Somehow, as the story goes, the band survived, but they did not return from captivity and get back to American until the 1980s.   Big Daddy would play 1980s hits in the style of 1950s and early 1960s rock band and even released a single of their cover version of \"Eye of the Tiger.\"  Their best song, which they used to conclude their own song-by-song remake of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album, is a cover version of \"A Day in the Life,\" but since the band plays the song \"in character,\" they do it in the style of Buddy Holly.   The Beatles, \"A Day in the Life\" is stitched together from lyrics that John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote separately, which means that the original song shifts styles several times.  Big Daddy handles the stylistic shifts in their own cover version of \"A Day in the Life\" by playing in the style of different Buddy Holly songs.  At first, Big Daddy's cover starts out in a style that's party \"Peggy Sue,\" part \"Oh Boy.\" Then when the song gets to the point when the vocals in the Beatles original shift to Paul McCartney (\"Woke up fell out of bed...\"), the style of the song suddenly shifts to mimic Buddy Holly's \"Everyday.\"  Then, it quotes some Mexican-style guitar (which frequently showed up on Buddy Holly records).  Instead of using an orchestra for the drawn-out epic final chord of the song, Big Daddy substitutes the surprisingly similar sound of a plane crashing.  The song then ends with a recreation of a radio broadcast of a news story about the death of Richie Valens, Big Bopper, and Buddy Holly.  The cover version is conceptual brilliant it is exactly how a 1950s rocker like Buddy Holy might have chosen to cover the Beatles if he had been stuck in cryogenic suspension since 1959.   ",

Some of my favourite cover songs: Joss Stone\u2019s and Rob Thomas\u2019 cover of Stevie Nicks' and Tom Petty's \u201cStop Draggin\u2019 My Heart Around\u201d. Joss and Rob have amazing chemistry. Killer rendition of the song.  Jimmy Wayne\u2019s cover of Hall and Oates' \u201cSara Smile\". Hey, i'm Sara and I'll smile a while for Jimmy, lol.  Prince, Tom Petty, Steve Winwood, Jeff Lynne and others\u2019 cover of George Harrison's \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". Prince\u2019s guitar solo is out of this world.  Walk Off the Earth\u2019s cover of Madonna\u2019s \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d. Sarah Blackwood looks like the most energetic pregnant woman ever! Fun video.  Cher's cover of Marc Cohn's \u201cWalking in Memphis\u201d. Cher nailed it.  Linda Ronstadt's covers of the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cTumbling Dice and Dee Dee Warwick's \u201cYou're No Good\u201d. The power of Ronstadt's voice is unbelievable. This performance of \u201cYou're No Good\" is one of the best I've ever heard.  Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor\u2019s cover of Prince\u2019s \u201cNothing Compares 2U. It's such a hauntingly beautiful song.  ",

Her version, paints a more darker image, that I believe, reflects the true meaning of the lyrics. As for #9, it's a toss up, depending on my mood. As for #12, I love the guitar in the Mystics version, but the Beach Boys vocals, win out. Different musical styles make it a tossup for #16, but I'll go with the Godfather of Soul's version, if only for the great opening dialogue he has with his backup band, the Famous Flames. Only Doggett's version made the top 40, going to #2, in 1956. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a wonderful question. I agree with several posters on many great covers. I originally read this question at work and kept including the words \u201cepic\u201d and \u201crock\u201d in my mind as part of the original question which I see is not the case. However, replacing the word \u201cbest\u201d with \u201cepic\u201d helps me keep the list pretty short, so I am gonna run with that. I will include \u201crock\u201d towards the end. First up I am a huge Lindsey Stirling fan. She does epic original work. she does covers. She does an does a great cover of \u201cRadioactive\u201d with Pentatonix, but I think it may fall short of epic. What might better fit the original question is her Phantom of the Opera Medley: Phantom of the Opera - Lindsey Stirling Still avoiding rock, but keeping epic as a criteria, I agree with the oft mentioned Hurt as covered by Johnny Cash: Johnny Cash Hurt - Official Music Video I think we can even amp this one up some. Johnny\u2019s cover of hurt was written shortly before his death, and it is clear in the video he was living that song. You just cannot fake that kind of authenticity. Just to amp up this theme maybe one notch, and edge closer to my self imposed \u201crock\u201d criteria, I offer Disturbed\u2019s cover of \u201cThe sound of silence: Disturbed - The Sound Of Silence [Official Music Video] Now you have had a chance to sample some of my musical tastes. This was all just a warmup for what I consider to be head and shoulders above all these. Consider one of the most arguably epic rock bands to date. They have so much respect for one another that the loss of one member causes the remaining members to disband, at possibly the height of their popularity. Their musical integrity is more important than a decade or two of additional lucrative touring and studio albums. Their lead singer has even been knighted by the Queen of England. The surviving members are being honored at the Kennedy center by a massive list of top-tier singers covering their most popular hits. Even the President of the United States is in attendance. The band is aprehensive, as they just KNOW that the final cover song of the night will be their signature song. The song that they HATE to hear played because it is just absolutely trashed by lesser musicians who really don\u2019t understand the song, or have any idea how to play it. But that is not what happens. Not on this night. Enter Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart. Enter the fallen bandmember\u2019s son Jason Bonham. Watch this if you watch nothing else from this feed: Stairway to Heaven (Led Zeppelin Tribute) Heart's Ann and Nancy Wilson - 2012 Kennedy Center Honors You have a strong solid roll band covering possibly one of the most iconic songs of all time in front of the original singer, Robert Plant, who is on record despising covers of Stairway to Heaven. You have dozens of A-list musicians and celebrities in attendance. You have the President of the United States there. As they later said, \u201cIts just Stairway to Heaven in front of Led Zeppelin and the President, no pressure!\u201d And they played it so well they brought Robert Plant to tears with emotion. I cannot top this one. ",

            "answer_text": "John Lennon - Angel Baby  Originally a one-hit wonder by Rosie & The Originals, this song has been covered numerous times but John Lennon does it in a way that manages to capture the feelings of wailing for a lost youth. John\u2019s solo works was good with the nostalgic bits. Charles Bradley - Changes  It\u2019s difficult to find a soul and R\u2019n\u2019B cover of a rock song, let alone heavy metal, which makes this cover very refreshing. The way this guy does this song can move many-a-person to tears without question. Elliott Smith - Jealous Guy  To those familiar with this singer, it is no secret that he was heavily influenced by the Beatles so to hear him covering a John Lennon song is to be expected. His delicate tone adds an extra element of vulnerability that even the original couldn\u2019t do. Uncle Tupelo - The Great Atomic Power  This song does an excellent job of giving this old Louvin Brothers classic a modern veneer. Opeth - Would?  Opeth may be progressive metal but their covers of classic rock songs are worth looking into so when I stumbled across their cover of this grunge song, I was blown away immediately. They manage to make it sound like the original without having to sacrifice their persona. ",

I Call Your Name - Covered by The Mamas and Papas, originally released by Billy J Kramer and the Dakotas in 1963 and the Beatles in 1964.  Refugee - I don\u2019t know how Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers felt about Melissa Etheridge\u2019s cover of this great song but I thought it was a fantastic effort by Melissa and her band.  Sharp Dressed Man - I\u2019ve never been much of a Nickelback fan but they KICKED ASS with this cover of the ZZ Top song during the 2007 Vh-1 Rock Honors.  Finally, the most recent one to surprise me a lot is actually from 2012 but I only came across it this past year, which is Stairway to Heaven as covered by Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, along with Jason Bonham, son of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. It starts out with the Wilson sisters and as the song progresses, we have back-up singers, a string section, and the Joyce Garrett Youth Choir on stage to round out a totally moving rendition of this Zeppelin classic. Just incredible and even Robert Plant seemed impressed.  ",

Some of such covers are well known covers, some others are so good most believe them to be the original and others stick loyal to the original composition with little to add to them. Here is my list of favorite renditions: Obscure covers that deserve more attention: MAN IN THE BOX, originally by Alice in Chains, covered by Phyllotaxis:  ENJOY THE SILENCE, originally by Depeche Mode, covered by Trevor Something. I wonder why this wasn\u2019t picked for the Ghost in the Shell movie instead. Feels a lot more cyberpunk to me:  ROLLING IN THE DEEP, originally by Adele, covered by Greta Van Fleet. This is what a pop song sounds like in its rock n\u2019 roll version:  NIGHT OF THE VAMPIRE, covered by Entombed, originally by Roky Erickson  DO THE EVOLUTION, originally by Pearl Jam, covered by death metal legends Criminal:  Little knew The Cure that with A FOREST they were opening the gates for a vast new genre in music, namely, Black Metal, that would come later in the early 90s with Burzum at least as we know it today. Here is a cover by Aeon Wind.  ANGIE, originally by The Rolling Stones, covered by Chilean rock Band La Ley. This cover is better than the original, and that\u2019s a factual statements. I\u2019m sorry. It just IS.  Then we have those covers everybody knows ARE covers and prefer them over the original\u2026 or at least, receive more attention than the song they cover: THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD  VULGARIS MAGISTRALIS  I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU  GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN  ",
