Actually, the reason i love BTS at first was when i found a video about Kim So Hyun and Kim Tae Hyung on youtube. I don\u2019t know who he is. After that i searching everything about V and he\u2019s one of BTS. V made me loves BTS more and more. Thank you Kim So Hyun for introduced me people like V and BTS \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude01 when i saw their (V and So Hyun) video on youtube, gosh\u2026. is Kim Tae Hyung have a crush on her?? But are they a friend?? Why an IDOL (like V BTS even greeting her on the stage \u201clong time no see\u201d and staring her like there is no day after tomorrow LOL) it\u2019s kinda cute for me. It\u2019s been 5 years i ever shipping Actress and Idol , my first shipping is Jang Wooyoung 2PM with Actress Park Se Young because of their variety show WE GOT MARRIED. It\u2019s not easy to shipping an IDOL with Actress but only their feelings and their hearts will gonna make everything go easy after that. And now after 5years i feels like a same vibe between Kim Taehyung and Kim So Hyun \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude01 there are so many videos or pictures about them on YOUTUBE and INSTAGRAM. Sometimes i feel \u201care they really like each other now???\u201d , \u201care they really dating??\u201d Or \u201cgosh, how many coincidence they have if all of this JUST A COINCIDENCE\u201d \u2026. As long as i know for sure if Kim So Hyun always have a project with an IDOL , CF MODEL even DRAMA together. If someday So Hyun and V get a project together it would be awesome \ud83d\ude01 but if they really really REAL it will be hard situation to do a project together, right? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02 we just can support no matter what and we have to protect them if they are REAL. but if they are impossible being a REAL. I hope someday watch their project together because their chemistry is on different level for sure \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc9c ",
