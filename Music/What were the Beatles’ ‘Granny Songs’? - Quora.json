            "answer_text": "John used the term \u201cGranny Music\u201d to describe and put down quite a bit of Paul\u2019s songs. John wanted to experiment and rock out. Paul was happy to write a broad range of music from hard rock to soft pop tunes. He prided himself on being able to write songs such as \u201cHoney Pie\u201d and create harder rock songs such as \u201cBack In The U.S.S.R.\u201d. As Paul put it, \u201csame guy wrote those, me, I wrote those\u201d. He appreciated his range. John did not suffer the easy on the ears pop songs that Paul began to put out and basically whined about them. So, a few examples would be: The Ballad Of Rocky Raccoon, Honey Pie, When I\u2019m 64, Hello Goodbye, Your Mother Should Know, I\u2019ve Just Seen A Face, Obladi-Oblada, Martha My Dear, I Will, and other bouncy teeny bop type songs. Paul went on to write many more of this type of music, such as Silly Love Songs and Just Another Day, and, as far as I\u2019m concerned, so what! He enjoyed writing and creating all kinds of music. I appreciate Paul\u2019s point. The range is remarkable. John can have his \u201cI Am The Walrus.\u201d I love it too. However, putting down what others create doesn\u2019t seem fair, especially when that artist also creates amazing music such as Yesterday, Oh Darling, Maybe I\u2019m Amazed, Back In The U.S.S.R., I\u2019m Down, and on and on. Paul would only respond, \u201cThat\u2019s just John being John.\u201d I believe, though no one can ever know, that John would have softened his opinion about Paul\u2019s Granny Music, and looked at the entire catalog by now. Age has a way of mellowing people a bit. What a shame that John\u2019s opinion has to be frozen in time due to his tragic death. He doesn\u2019t get the chance to grow and change with the times, and hence, is judged harshly for opinions he held briefly 50 years ago. His death is an ongoing tragedy because we were all cheated out of seeing him shine on and on and on and on. I still mourn his death and refuse to utter the name of his despicable murderer. I hate the fact that I can even remember it. It deserves no place in my brain. ",

            "answer_text": "That term was used by John to describe Paul\u2019s songs, I don\u2019t know when he started calling them \u201cGranny\u2019s Songs.\u201d It seemed like it occurred later in their careers, as they were starting to change and eventually split up. I believe a few of those songs, according to what I have read, are Obla di Obla da, Yesterday, and after they split, some of Paul\u2019s solo songs. In John\u2019s \u201ctribute\u201d song to Paul \u201cHow do you Sleep\u201d, seemingly written in anger, he referred to Paul\u2019s \u201cAnother Day.\u201d We will never really know how deep this anger was or even if it was just momentary. Paul\u2019s response song, again I have read, was \u201cToo many People\u201d from his \u201cRam\u201d album. As they got older and changed their styles before the Beatles split, you can see John\u2019s style is totally different than Paul\u2019s \u201cSilly Love Songs\u201d as John was writing things like \u201cWorking Class Hero.\u201d Both styles had merit for sure, both styles very likable in their own way. I certainly would not call Paul\u2019s songs \u201cGranny Music\u201d at all, just different than John\u2019s, and ironically enough, possibly more successful as time went along. ",
