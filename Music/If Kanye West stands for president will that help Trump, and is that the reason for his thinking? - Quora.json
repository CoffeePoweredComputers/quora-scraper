            "answer_text": "Kanye is a self promoter. His Presidential run stunt is just an effort to get an increasingly irrelevant name in the press for a couple more days/weeks. To think he might help Trump by siphoning off Black votes from Biden is, I would think, rather insulting to Black voters. If Paris Hilton ran for President, would Trump be worried about losing voters? Well, they\u2019re both reality TV stars, so maybe. Okay, if Kid Rock ran for President, would Trump be worried? Eh\u2026actually he might. Dang, the Republican bar has been set so low I\u2019m having a hard time thinking of a White equivalent to Kanye who Trump voters wouldn\u2019t go for like a bright shiny object. Scott Baio maybe? If Scott Baio ran for President under a platform of \u2018Charles in Charge\u2019 would Trump be worried? See, it\u2019s a silly question. ",
