            "answer_text": "I love them all so much so this is really hard to choose\u2026well at least for the song. For the album, my second, third, and fourth are all so close together, but my number one is way ahead of the pack. My favorite album from the Beatles is\u2026 Revolver Sgt. Peppers, Rubber Soul, and A Hard Day\u2019s Night all come behind as albums I\u2019d recommend, but Revolver encompasses every type of music the Beatles would ever release, and showcased every Beatle doing some their best work. For example, I love John\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Only Sleeping.\u201d It was such a freaky song and sounded really clothe first time I head, even though the lyrics are simply about not wanting to get up in the morning. The album closer \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d is a revolutionary work from John, as he basically \u201ccreated\u201d psychedelic music and popularized the avant-garde sound. Ringo had what is for sure his most famous song, \u201cYellow Submarine,\u201d and he has some pretty cool drum tracks as well. Paul also saw a lot of success with his beautiful ballads \u201cHere, There, and Everywhere\u201d (a close second on my favorite song decision), \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d and \u201cFor No One.\u201d I could listen to those three songs on loop for the rest of my life (Who am I kidding! I already sing them on loop in my head). Lastly, and what I consider the most beneficial sign of growth, is GEORGE HARRISON\u2019S CONTRIBUTIONS. Please do me a favor and go listen to \u201cTaxman,\u201d \u201cLove You To,\u201d and \u201cI Want To Tell You,\u201d which are his three contributions (the most he ever had on one single album: the White album has 4 over 2 full albums.). When you finish listening, come back and finish reading this. Done? Hopefully you think George is so much more integral to the Beatles\u2019 success now. These three contributions encompass everything changing about the Beatle. Taxman showcases their future revolutionary tendencies, as it was their first song involving politics (the Beatles used to be taxed at 95%; hence, one for you nineteen for me. THE MORE YOU KNOW.). Love You To is George\u2019s first of three fully Eastern songs, and my personal favorite. It also has some philosophical lyrics. I Want To Tell You is pretty underrated in my opinion. It has some strong harmonies and I personally like the guitar sound and melodies. I still can\u2019t forget to mention \u201cShe Said She Said,\u201d \u201cGood Day Sunshine,\u201d and \u201cAnd Your Bird Can Sing,\u201d which take the heart of the album to new heights. \u201cGot to Get You Into My Life\u201d is a fun Jazz starter, too. The only song I don\u2019t particularly love is \u201cDoctor Robert.\u201d But the rest of the album is pure genius. The last thing I\u2019ll mention before I get to my favorite song (which will be much shorter) is that my favorite thing about the whole album is the raw beauty of the album. You can hear in the music how points it can sound so simple as a person singing with a piano (\u201cFor No One\u201d) to something so complex like \u201cTomorrow Never Knows.\u201d It also just feels like you're in the studio with them recording because they have additions like the intro before Taxman, the big chorus in Yellow Submarine, or even hearing John telling Paul to yawn in \u201cI\u2019m Only Sleeping.\u201d (Trust me you can hear it with headphones.). Okay, on to the favorite song. I honestly have to go with\u2026 If I Fell On A Hard Day's Night, I personally love everything about it. The music, the Harmonies, even the voice crack from Paul in the mono mix. I could listen to that song constantly until the day I die. I hope this is interesting and I do recommend a listen to all of these songs! ",

            "answer_text": "What is your favorite Beatles album and why is it your favorite? This is such a difficult question because I have always had two favorite Beatles albums. (Really, every Beatle album is a favorite, because they were always the best band in the world to me). The two that stand out for me are Rubber Soul and Revolver. There is just so much original greatness on these two albums. The \u2018boys\u2019 had really come into their own on both. They were beginning their musical experimentation on Rubber Soul and they were full on into that and perfected it on Revolver. It seems as if everyone who loves the Beatles pick one of these albums as their favorite. It\u2019s almost unbelievable how good each and every song was written and performed. They were certainly on an excellent roll! Rubber Soul honorable mentions go to \u2018It\u2019s Only Love\u2019, \u2018If I needed Someone\u2019, and \u2018Run For Your Life\u2019\u2026although this album is stellar in it\u2019s genius with songs like \u2018I\u2019ve Just Seen A Face\u2019, \u2018Girl\u2019, \u2018Michelle\u2019, \u2018In My Life\u2019\u2026etc. You won\u2019t want to skip any song on this album. It\u2019s that good. Particular Revolver standouts for me are \u2018I\u2019m Only Sleeping\u2019 (one of my all time favorite Beatles songs), \u2018And Your Bird Can Sing\u2019, \u2018Taxman\u2019, \u2018She Said She Said\u2019, \u2018Good Day Sunshine\u2019, \u2018Doctor Robert\u2019, and \u2018Tomorrow Never Knows\u2019\u2026all masterpieces. (I also very much love the Abbey Road album because two of my all time favorite Beatles songs that George wrote and sang, \u2018Something\u2019 and \u2018Here Comes The Sun\u2019, are on that album. I think they are two of the finest songs ever written in music). EDIT: HELP! was a great album too. With absolutely fantastic songs like \u2018The Night Before\u2019, \u2018You\u2019re Gonna Lose That Girl\u2019, \u2018I Need You\u2019, and \u2018Another Girl\u2019 it must be mentioned here as well. There are also fave classics on that album like \u2018HELP\u2019, \u2018Hard Day\u2019s Night\u2019, and \u2018Ticket To Ride\u2019. There will never be another band like them :) EDIT AGAIN (Two questions were merged): My favorite Beatles song? I can\u2019t choose. I have quite a few favorites. I love \u2018I\u2019m Only Sleeping\u2019 , \u2018Happy Just To Dance With You\u2019, \u2018I Don\u2019t Want To Spoil The Party\u2019\u2026etc ",

            "answer_text": "Many people have answered this question as if it were \u2018What is the best Beatles album?\u2019 But I like it being about personal preference, because my answer is weird. I think that the most groundbreaking and most beautifully made Beatles albums are probably Sgt Pepper, Revolver and Abbey Road, but fond as I am of them, my favourite Beatles album is actually Please Please Me. Whaaaat? The early pop stuff? Are you kidding? Can't you hear that the later stuff is deeper and better crafted and more mind-blowing and\u2026 Yes, I can. I know all that, and I agree. The mature Beatles made magnificent music. I don't think that Please Please Me is even as good a sheer pop album as A Hard Day\u2019s Night, which has a power and confidence that PPM aspires to. But, the first Beatles album is the first record I ever owned. It's a rush of raw joy, most of it torn in a single day from the hands and sore throats of a band elated at being given its big chance. Harrison can't really sing yet, Ringo is driving the bus and yelling encouragement, Lennon and McCartney are hurling themselves into the rockers and being smoothly urbane and only a bit hoarse on the softer ones. I love it more than any other Beatles album, because it made me fall in love with music. And it still has the power to do that, 40 years after I first heard it and 54 years after it was originally released. ",

            "answer_text": "I came to love The Beatles as a 12 year old and my favorite song and album are linked in that respect, even though they are not directly linked. As a wildly hormone stricken 7th grader, I fell in love slow dancing to Hey Jude. I remember going into a tiny recored shop in Great Falls, Montana. I didn't know the song, so all I could do was sing what struck in my mind: \u201cTake a sad song and make it better.\u201d The clerk plopped the 45 into the counter, and I chimed in, \u201cThe Beatles? Are they still together?\u201d A few weeks later, I picked up Revolver, because I thought the cover was cool and I recognized some of the songs. It was the greatly flawed Capitol US version, so it was missing many great tunes, but I fell in love with tunes like For No One and She Said She Said. While I love all their output, and now I have the original UK version, not only has it remained my favorite, but I agree with those who count it as their best effort. And I still get chills when Paul delivers the first words in Hey Jude. ",

            "answer_text": "My favourite Beatles albums, contrary to what others believe are their best albums, are from the time when Beatles wrote poppy songs \u2014 my favourite of these being A Hard Day's Night. Why? Because they are fun, and catchy. I don't know why, I prefer to listen to catchy Beatles songs than artistically-pleasing ones. As for my favourite song, again, I'll go slightly uncoventional. My choice would be Blackbird and I Don't Wanna Spoil the Party (a tie). Blackbird is a beautiful song \u2014 let's not doubt why I rate it so highly. As for IDWSP, I rate it highly because it speaks of a little introverted guy who expects his date to turn up, but is quietly disappointed to find she doesn't come. He feels disappointed, sure, but is too civilized to make a racket and quietly departs to wallow in self-sympathy, perhaps. Sounds relatable to you? I can sure relate to that! And that somehow endears to me more than my second place-songs \u2014 And I Love Her, Here Comes the Sun, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and A Hard Day's Night. ",

            "answer_text": "My vote goes to the Revolver album and the song \"Eleanor Rigby.\"  That album strikes the perfect balance of being experimental/exploratory while being accessible and relatable.  That said, on some days I'd say the same thing about Rubber Soul -- both albums are filled with consistently high-quality songs.  The middle era, to me, represents the most mature sound of the foursome as a band.  The late era had grander expansions and indulgent experiments, but the cohesion as a unit was slipping by that point and individual voices come through more.   Which is a bit contradicting because \"Eleanor Rigby\" isn't exactly a band effort, either, but to me that song epitomizes the impact of the Beatles.  The fusion of highly melodic pop, relatable/universal/timeless lyrics, and classical music.  The last piece was largely George Martin (their producer/arranger)'s contribution, and I'm of opinion that without him the Beatles would not have been as significant as they are.  Simply put, the classical influence gives their songs more depth and timeless quality and lifts them above mere pop ditties of the era.  Classical music matured far earlier than other genres of music that followed, where by late 19th centuries much of tonal harmony was fully explored and the 20th century composers were venturing out of conventions and exploring more atonal and impressionistic arenas.  George Martin didn't simply slap pretty violins to play on top of sappy ballads.  \"Eleanor Rigby\" is a great example -- it's scored for double string quartets, a highly unusual configuration.  Notice how none of the strings double the vocal melodies, but rather they provide more contrapuntal contrast, weaving in and out, always supporting the harmony but never settling down to simply frame the chords.  This is crazy adventurous music even by today's pop/rock standards, and to pull it off without sacrificing one iota of accessibility and hookiness is a marvelous feat.  Not only is it experimental but the pieces add up to create a cohesive whole, where the whole ensemble expresses this tension-filled, intensely felt yearning.   The Beatles became what they are not just because they wrote memorable melodies that you sing along to.  They became significant because beneath the catchy choruses they relentlessly experimented and explored, and George Martin's classical influences helped them do that in a classy, authentic manner.  I wish more acts take notice of this and fuse classical influences into their arrangements.  To be fair some have gone there but they often trade in accessibility in the process.  It's a balancing act, but studying these Beatles albums help us figure out where the ideal balance may lie.  ",

            "answer_text": "The people\u2019s choice seems to be Revolver (I\u2019m baffled) but for me, Abbey Road is their best and not even by a narrow margin. To summarize in five reasons, first it is the only album that I can\u2019t find a mediocre track on. Every other album has a low point somewhere, even if the lows blend in nicely. Second, for one album and one album only a genie granted Ringo and George the power to write as well Lennon and McCartney. The George songs were his best two in his entire songwriting career, the Ringo song could have been written for him by John or Paul. He likewise never bettered it. Third, it\u2019s the longest single player. Only the White Album is longer and the White Album is a much loved but patchy album. Fourth, it has the best musicianship and musical ideas- to name a few- the bassline on Something, the medley on side 2, the 3 part guitar solo, the 3 part harmonies on Because, the use of Moog synthesiser, Ringo\u2019s drum solo and generally excellent drumming, the use of a leitmotif (the You Never Give Me Your Money melody reappears orchestrally in Carry the Weight) and inspired touches like Ringo singing harmony on Carry that Weight and Paul adapting a nursery rhyme first published in 1603. Fifth, John and Paul were also (still) improving as songwriters, so we also get the best version of John and Paul. And a bonus point. The sound quality and production on Abbey Road is superior to any other Beatles album, though Rubber Soul was very well produced for its day, as was A Hard Day\u2019s Night. In short, the Beatles did something classier than they\u2019d ever done and in many respects anything that came before seemed like them getting ready for this one moment of unadulterated pop excellence. In my opinion. However, my favourite Beatles song is I\u2019ve got a feeling and that\u2019s on Let It Be. ",

If I had to pick a favorite album, I'd have to go with the White Album because so many of my favorite Beatles songs come from there. This album shows the incredible versatility in style of the Beatles. For example, you have the classic rock n' roll feel with songs like Back in the U.S.S.R, Glass Onion and Helter Skelter and then songs like Mother Nature's Son, Dear Prudence and Blackbird to completely juxtapose the aforementioned songs.  My favorite song however, is Something from Abbey Road written by George Harrison who is my favorite Beatle. This song was solidified as my favorite after watching Living in a Material World, which is a documentary about George Harrison and the Beatles. In the documentary, they explain that although people consider it to be one of the greatest love songs of all times, it is not a song written about a woman, but rather nature itself.  ",

Yet also, they flow into each other brilliantly. It's the most group-like effort to me, where they all pretty much sing together or back each other on every song. Most of these songs finally gave music & lyrics a deeper meaning instead of their \"boy/girl\" type songs & more introspective. \"Nowhere Man\"- first of all, it describe me pretty much! I like the way the song flows, the harmonies, George's guitar solo. It's got a cool groove to it. Groovy song. (I've always been torn by picking an all-time fave, but I pick Nowhere Man. Then In My Life & Strawberry Fields Forever.)    I drew that marker / pencil drawing when I was a teenager! ",

Quite a contrast to some of the profanity-ridden and highly sexualized music that is more readily available to us today. My favorite song is I should have known better which is from the same album. I love the innocent and pure romance of the lyrics and how it's slightly uptempo. And I also like John's harmonica parts. An instrument that didn't get much life on their records\u2026. ",

There's just so much variety to choose from. There's good classic rock, psychedelic rock, hard Rock, soft singer songwriter, and country. Currently my favorite Beatles song is Its All Too Much from Yellow Submarine. I personally George Harrison's writing style more John, Paul, and Ringo. It's All Too Much mixes psychedelic and harder rock really well. ",

            "answer_text": "The Double Album Rubber Soul 1 and 2. I am kidding of course but The Beatles often referred to Rubber Soul and their next album Revolver that way. To me they represent the maturing of the band moving away from pure pop or rock and roll music to folk and country style tunes and to real experimentation with unique instruments, sounds and recording techniques. The period of mid 64 through 1966 (pre Pepper) is when they produced their most melodic, yet ground breaking works. A lot of younger fans might prefer Sergeant Pepper, Abby Road or The White Album because of their varied tunes and subject matter but to me their middle years are when the power of their song writing and collaboration really shone through.

As I purchased them upon their initial release back in the 60\u2019s, the newest became my favorite until I literally wore the grooves out . In retrospect I feel a bit shortchanged because the British albums were far superior to what we were peddled in the US. Fifty years later now and I can\u2019t single out one album but the three album progression beginning with Rubber Soul to Revolver to Sgt. Pepper really speaks to their growth as writers and recorders of the best music of that decade. It still amazes me that they wrote and recorded Rubber Soul in only a month. ",
