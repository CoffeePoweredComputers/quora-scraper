            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll echo what you\u2019ll hear from all other longtime drummers on here \u2014 you truly understand and appreciate Ringo\u2019s drummer more and more as you get older and more experienced. Lesser experienced drummers (and many musicians) tend to think it\u2019s all about technical ability. So, early on, you\u2019re blown away by the likes of Neil Peart, Billy Cobham, Bill Bruford, Stewart Copeland, etc. And no doubt, they are beyond impressive. It\u2019s the typical mistaking of \u201cdrumming as sport\u201d that causes us to liken it to athleticism when we\u2019re early in our learning how to play the drums. But then at some point in your development you realize that there\u2019s a certain something that actually separates the best of the best. Here are a few of the qualities that indicate this in drumming: Ability (whether intuitive or learned) to play just the right pattern to fit the song. This is akin to choosing a vocal style to convey the lyrics. I\u2019d argue, however, that this is more intuitive than learned; however, I certainly think it can be developed or improved upon.Knowing how to play within the best harmony (not in the literal musical sense) of the entire band for each given song. This means sometimes taking the lead, sometimes not; sometimes playing busily, sometimes not. Most of all, it means understanding your role musically within the band at all times. This is what\u2019s often missing from technically great drummers you see on YouTube who aren\u2019t in bands. The minute your drumming is incorporated into the greater structure of a band and its music, things change dramatically. It\u2019s a team effort, not a solo effort.You understand that you\u2019re an artist, not just a technician. Some musicians argue that creativity wins over technical ability every time, but I won\u2019t go that far. Creativity, however, is greatly overlooked in drumming, especially by casual fans and early drummers. A non-Ringo example is John Bonham\u2019s playing in \u201cGood Times, Bad Times,\u201d which is most regarded for his super-fast single-bass triplets. But aside from these, his playing in many aspects was highly creative throughout the song. Most drummers will admit, I would\u2019ve never thought to play it that way. This is something you hear again and again about Bonham\u2019s artistic choices in his playing.Ringo excelled at all of these. But it\u2019s important to not discount his technical abilities for his time. No, he can\u2019t compare to Danny Carey, for example, but it\u2019s important to keep assessments of his technique to the context of the time. In this regard, Ringo was more impressive than many people realize. Last, as many smart people on Quora have pointed out in other Ringo answers, he contributed many signature drum parts to a lot of Beatles songs. What I mean by this is, you could take away much or all of the surrounding music and still identify the song by Ringo\u2019s playing. One of the best examples is \u201cTicket to Ride.\u201d Any Beatles fan could hear the drum part alone and name the song in five seconds; I\u2019d bet many non-Beatles fans who know the song could do this as well. The miracle of the Beatles was that what I\u2019m describing above characterized all four members. None were virtuosos at their instruments, but individually and together they instinctively understood (none had musical training) exactly how to play for the highest good of each song. (Yes, some of their songs were \u201cmisses,\u201d but I\u2019m speaking of their overall inarguably impressive catalog.) And Ringo, in this regard, was no less a contributor than the others. There have been very few successful bands in which this can be said of the drummer. [Answered: What do drummers think of Ringo Starr?] ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been playing for twenty years, and I\u2019ve also been writing songs for the same amount of time. Most of the songs I wrote were by necessity\u2014I played in bands with my best friend, he would come up with a chord progression, and I\u2019d write lyrics and tunes to go along with it when there was nobody else to do it. When we played in bands with proper singers, they usually took charge. In the past few years, I\u2019ve started writing more music and looking at the entire song as a gestalt whole. I say this because, as a drummer, I\u2019m one of those old school flashy guys. Lots of little fills, very busy hihats, I sound like a chintzy imitation of the great Stewart Copeland. When I was younger, I was obsessed with sounding like my heroes, all of whom are technically very advanced\u2014Buddy Rich, Billy Cobham, Bill Bruford, Tim Alexander, etc. The more I write songs, the more I think of drums not as an end to themselves, but as an instrument on which to play a melody. And when you start thinking of it that way, the music becomes more important than triplets and polyrhythms. If you look at drums as a melodic, musical instrument, then you can\u2019t go beyond drum compositions like \u201cTicket to Ride\u201d, \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d, or my favorite, \u201cCome Together\u201d. Those drums are as integral to the song as Paul\u2019s bass or John and George\u2019s guitars. I love a lot of drummers, but can\u2019t think of many who have created something so unique and simple that it forms the basis of the melody of the most famous rock songs of the last century. The hair on the back of my neck stands up when I think of Ringo playing \u201cCome Together\u201d. The other thing is, he has this lazy, stuttering groove that just kills me. His feel thumps like a giant wearing brick shoes, and at other times scratches the snare drum like a cat making cookies on your belly. He\u2019s like an artist in oils, hacking at the canvas or using the most subtle of strokes. Look at his drumming in \u201cWhen I\u2019m Sixty Four\u201d\u2014it\u2019s barely there, but it\u2019s perfect. Another thing too is, rock drums were still in their infancy when Ringo came around. So a lot of these fancy fills and stuff didn\u2019t exist at the time. They may be important, they may not be. I place a lot of importance in those things, while a more accomplished musician may not. But damn, son\u2014listen to how a young ass Ringo opens up his hihats in the chorus in this live performance, and then goes back to the smooth groove. It\u2019s like butter, thunderstorm, and back to butter again. Charlie Watts couldn\u2019t do better.  ",
