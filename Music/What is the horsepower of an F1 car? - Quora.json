            "answer_text": "Today\u2019s F1 power units consist of a 1,6-liter V6 internal combustion turbo engine and the energy recovery system consists of MGU-H, MGU-K and batteries. The entire system is controlled by electronics. The energy recovery system (ERS) strength is limited to a maximum of 163 HP for 33.3 seconds in one lap, which means that for a total power of 1000 HP the engine itself must have at least 837 HP. At this moment, the most powerful F1 engine is made by Ferrari, with around 1050\u20131100 HP, followed by Mercedes and Red Bull (Honda engine) with just over the magical and psychological number of 1000 HP. In the Turbo era of the 80\u2019s, in qualifying trim, an F1 car engine could reach almost 1400 HP. Here you have a list with each team per engine manufacturer (2019): Ferrari engine - Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Haas Mercedes engine - Mercedes, Racing Point, Williams Honda engine - Red Bull, Toro Rosso Renault engine - Renault, McLaren ",

            "answer_text": "From the beginning of the new power unit era last year(2014), manufactures has been secretive about the exact power these engines generates. With the engine development race is now wide open, each manufacture's power unit has slightly different power figure. F1 pundits believe that the class leading 2015 Mercedes power unit's ic engine alone produces more than 700hp and with the additional ERS power of 160hp, the combined figure is getting closer to the whooping 900hp mark.  In the previous KERS era the energy harvesting is limited to 400 KJ per lap, which limits the 80hp KERS boost to 7 seconds per lap. But under the new regulations, the teams can harvest 10 times more energy(about 4 MJ) which results in more than 33 seconds of ERS boost time per lap. The other aspect to consider is that, while the amount of energy recovered by the MGU-K(Motor Generator Unit Kinetic) is strictly regulated, the total energy produced by the MGU-H(Motor Generator Unit Heat) is not regulated, which happens to be the area where the Mercedes unit dominates.
