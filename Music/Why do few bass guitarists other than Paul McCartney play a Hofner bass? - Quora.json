            "answer_text": "The following might tell you more about my indifference to the H\u00f6fner 500/1 as an instrument than just saying \u201cmeh.\u201d I played a 500/1 when I was 15 because the band I was in had three guitar players and one of us needed to play bass. I drew short straw. I was also a lefty. I had been playing right handed guitars upside down for a few years by that point and was sick of it, but left handed anything was custom order and I didn\u2019t have cash for that (cash or check only then). I bought mine used \u2014 $200 for it and a Peavey bass stack. The stack alone was worth it. Since the bass was symmetrical it looked okay despite being turned around. It was pretty cheap because it was associated with the Beatles and nobody wanted to play that stuff in 1973. As it was right handed I removed the pickguard \u2014 it was useless for me as a lefty \u2014 and reversed the nut. Done. I don\u2019t know the year of manufacture. It was a genuine H\u00f6fner though, and the finish was checked along the grain due to moisture (A/C wasn\u2019t a big thing in the 60s). Despite that, I never had issues with tuning or neck bend or bow. The fretboard was pretty narrow but my hands weren\u2019t huge so that was okay. It was incredibly light because it was hollow. That feature was great on the shoulders for a skinny kid, but the same feature meant that it moved all over the place if one played energetically. It always felt like a toy to me but it worked okay. It was good enough for a garage band. I sold it (and the stack) when I was 17 and bought a lefty Les Paul with the proceeds. For nostalgia\u2019s sake I bought a new 500/1 in left hand orientation about 2 years ago. I play it every now and then. It\u2019s exactly like I remember. Should have bought a Fender P Bass or Jazz Bass. ",

            "answer_text": "You might need to ask the question the other way around, \u201cWhy did McCartney play the Hofner bass?\u201d, followed by the question whether this would be a good reason for others too. First, McCartney was a left-handed player. The Hofner bass is almost symmetrical, so you can play it left-handed too, easily. You needn't look for a left-handed bass. Second, in England of those days American guitars, like Fenders, were very hard to get. There was not much choice. Once in supply, McCartney switched to a.o. the Rickenbacker. So, are these good, decisive reasons to buy a Hofner bass? I guess for most bass players not. It's light-weighted, though, which might be a good reason. When I wanted to buy a bass guitar, I considered one, because it was one of the few bass guitars in my budget, and from a decent manufacturer. McCartney, I guess still plays it becausecit has \u201cgrown\" on him, and it has the authentic Beatles sound. I can't imagine him using it for Silly Love Songs or Jet. So it was best (only) option in those days in his situation. Most bass players now are not in those days and not in his situation. ",
