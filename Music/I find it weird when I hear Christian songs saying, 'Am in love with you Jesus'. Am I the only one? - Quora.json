Their being in love with a god precludes the amorous nature of love, however, while retaining the same kind of obsession that accompanies being in love. They are consumed by it, along with a big chunk of their rational minds as they steadfastly believe in tales of miraculous feats and adhere to such strained rationalizations as the Trinity.  Roman Catholic nuns even \"marry\" Jesus in absentia, becoming Brides of Christ and thereafter wearing a wedding band on the left hand, same as if they'd married a real person. The non-sexual nature of their relationship with the deity is manifest. Despite this caveat, they, along with the priests of that religion, renounce their sexuality, which they regard as a sinful impulse inflicted upon all people by Original Sin, i.e. Adam & Eve's eating the forbidden fruit. Having dedicated that portion of their humanness to God, who has no use for it, they are supposed to remain celibate among other people, anyway. ",

            "answer_text": " Home | Wretched Radio Also: Despite the popularity of the phrase, the Bible never talks about us  \u201cfalling in love with God,\u201d and I would recommend not using the phrase. I  know it\u2019s popular. In fact, I sometimes slip up and say the phrase,  since it\u2019s so familiar. But the modern phrase \u201cfalling in love with\u201d  does not capture what the Bible means when it talks about loving God.  The phrase \u201cfalling in love with\u201d comes from the Elizabethan view of  romance, which is foreign to the Bible. It refers to a highly  emotionally and thoroughly conditional feeling toward someone else,  usually based on attraction and the way they make you feel.  Just Google the phrase \u201cfalling in love\u201d and you\u2019ll get some pretty  sappy definitions that I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to transfer to my  posture toward God, and neither would Isaiah (Isa. 6). Even when spouses  are commanded to love each other (Eph 5:25 and others), this love is  all about selfless, sacrificial, unconditional commitment that\u2019s  governed by the cross and not by how the other person makes you feel. Saying  you \u201cfall in love with God\u201d is taking a 19th century concept and  reading it back into the Bible. And it\u2019s subtly dangerous, since it  reads a conditional understanding of love back into the biblical concept  of unconditional love. So let\u2019s stick to theologically rich concept of  biblical, agape love when speaking of God. And let\u2019s not sing to our  risen King as if he\u2019s the boyfriend who never lets us down.  Is Jesus My Boyfriend?",
