            "answer_text": "Chords and melody support each other.  They'll do that best when the melody notes are also chord tones.  So it's not really what scale goes with a chord, but what scale tones do - any given scale will have some notes that work better with a specific chord, and some that won't work quite as well. The details of the melody matter, too.  A note that's not a chord tone is called a non-harmonic tone.  When you use them, they're generally better if they're not emphasized - they should be shorter in duration, not accented, and fall either in between beats or on weak beats.  They'll sound best in three general situations: when they fall in between adjacent chord tones (they're called \"passing tones\" when this happens), or when a chord tone moves to an adjacent non-harmonic tone and right back to the chord tone (called \"neighbor tones\"), or when they immediately move to the nearest chord tone (called \"appoggiatura\"). With those considerations out of the way, let's take an A pentatonic minor scale as an example.  It's got the notes A, C, D, E and G.  Basic chords that contain at least one of those notes are Ab, Ab7, A, Am, A7, Bb, Bb7, Bm, B7, C, Cm, C7, C#m, D, Dm, D7, Eb, E, Em, E7, F, Fm, F7, F#m, F#7, G, Gm and G7. But not all of those chords will sound good with the entire scale.  C#m will sound fine with the E note, because it's a chord tone, but it will sound off if the melody note is C or G - the chord has sharped versions of those notes.  And not all of those chords will sound good together! So while you CAN harmonize a melody using any, or even all, of those chords, it's a heck of a lot easier to start with a chord progression and decide what scale to use over it.  You'll still have the problem of not all notes sounding good with all chords, but you can at least narrow it down to an acceptable level of dissonance, and let your ear be your guide from there. A pentatonic minor scale will agree with most chords in the same key, or with the chords in its relative major key.  So the chords that will tend to work best with an A pentatonic minor scale will be Am, C, Dm, Em, E7, F, G and G7.  The other chords I listed above CAN work, but it's harder to make them fit.  And there are lots of other chords that can also be made to fit - I didn't list any extended or altered chords. ",

            "answer_text": "Pentatonic scales are interesting in that they are very flexible scales. Start simple and play the scale over major, minor and dominant 7th chords. So Am pentatonic can be played over A major, A minor and A7.    You can also add I, IV and V structures. Play Am pentatonic over A, D and E, then Am, Dm, Em, then A7, D7, E7. You can also mix them- Am, Dm, E7 or Am, D7, E7 etc.     You can also make each chord in the pentatonic scale a dominant 7th chord. So Am pentatonic would turn into A7, C7, D7, E7, G7.  The \"how\" you figure these things out start by studying the overtone series and related harmonics for each note. Everything starts to make sense once you master this concept.  ",
