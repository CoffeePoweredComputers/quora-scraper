            "answer_text": "Because the tune of national anthem arises that hidden feeling of patriotism inside you. You have read since childhood about being patriotic and respecting the national symbols and standing in honour of national anthem and song etc. During childhood you always dreamt of serving the nation (everybody does) because at that time you were never worried about your future and worldly pleasures . But as you grow up , your personal needs and desire for bright future sides all that up and you get busy in shaping your career . And this is the reason when you hear national anthem , you get goose pimples. ",
