The vocals are also present and let me just say, it\u2019s phenomenal. \u2018All I Wanna Do\u2019 - Jay Park, Hoody, and Loco This was one of the first Jay Park songs I heard and I actually first fell in love with the choreography. I loved the production and the sound is awesome. \u2018Cupid\u2019 - pH-1 and PENOMECO It has such 00\u2032 vibes to it and that\u2019s what I love about this song. The flow was perfect throughout the song and the chorus is beyond catchy. \u2018Post It\u2019 - Loco and Jay Park I actually first heard the Hwasa and Loco version (stan talent, stan mamamoo) but I really like the original version too. It\u2019s really laid back but the vocal delivery Loco gives out is gorgeous. I love every part of this song. \u2018Gottasadae\u2019 - BewhY All of the different sounds in the song shook me. Byungyoon is a super fast rapper and that part in the song shook me too. His flow is beyond amazing and the transitions are super good. \u2018Mommae\u2019 - Jay Park and Ugly Duck It actually took me a while to like this song but now it\u2019s one of my favorites. This song just makes me go \u201cayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\u201d, it\u2019s that good! \u2018Full House\u2019 - MOBB The vibe in this song is so awesome and I really enjoy the chorus. Mino\u2019s verses were actually my favorite but they both killed it. \u2018Transcend\u2019 - BewhY and C Jamm The intro is a huge tease but they didn\u2019t let me down. The guitar in the beginning hooked me immediately but C JAMM can sing. He can seriously sing. I love the sound and the vibe this song gives off, it\u2019s fantastic. \u2018HOLUP!\u2019 - Bobby This is such a dope song. It\u2019s actually super chaotic but he makes it work. It takes a few listens to enjoy but it\u2019s really, really good. His rapping voice is also super unique which makes it even better. \u2018Puzzle\u2019 - BewhY and C Jamm I loved this song from the first listen. It\u2019s seriously aMAZING. The hype is wonderful and he\u2019s so good at rap-singing (whatever you call it). \u2018OKEY DOKEY\u2019 - Mino and Zico (Haha, I forgot I was writing this answer and watched the video twice) I love how fun and hype this song is. It\u2019s just a really dope song that has wonderful stage presence and you can tell they had fun performing it. \u2018Pour Up\u2019 - Dean and Zico This is one of my favorites by Dean (happy birthday bb <33), it\u2019s so good and the vocals are wonderful. Zico helped add so much flair to this song but they are such a great mix. This song is nice and the amount of talent is beyond me. \u2018I\u2019m Not Sorry\u2019 - Dean and Eric Bellinger I don\u2019t know if this song counts but I do know that this song is fucking amazing. The vocals in this song?! Amazing. The production is great and their voices mix really well together. I love the lyrics too. \u2018Me Like Yuh\u2019 - Jay Park and Hoody I love his vocals. It\u2019s surprisingly a really peaceful song and it\u2019s a super gorgeous listen. Hoody Kim has such a gorgeous voice and I love how she contributed to the song. The choreography is also really good too. Omg, this actually got long, haha ~fm ",
