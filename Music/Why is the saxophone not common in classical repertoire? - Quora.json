            "answer_text": "By the time the saxophone was invented, the symphony orchestra wind section was already fairly well established and there just was no need to add a whole group of new instruments. The trend in the 19th century was rather to expand the numbers of each instrument and to add auxiliary players in the same families (eg cor anglais, contrabassoon, bass clarinet). Also, the sound of the saxophone tends to stick out a bit from the standard wind section sound. Its use in the symphony orchestra has primarily been as a solo instrument, not as part of the blend. ",

            "answer_text": "Adolphe Sax invented / developed it in 1840. The \u201cClassical\u201d period, (Haydn, Mozart) as well as the early Romantic period (Beethoven, Schubert) had come and gone. No chance of a saxophone sonata or concerto from any of them. Add several years for the sax to be played well enough to catch the ear and imagination of a composer. And from the 20th Century onwards, it has, from time to time. ",
