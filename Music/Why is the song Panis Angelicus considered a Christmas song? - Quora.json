            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know why. But I\u2019ve noticed that some singers place it in their Christmas albums. I surmise that they do so because Cesar Franck\u2019s music to it is beautiful. In any case, many singers include other non-Christmas music in their Christmas repertoire as well: One of many examples is the Ave Maria. It\u2019s a prayer said by Catholics worldwide maybe a million (no exaggeration) times a day, 365 days a year. Like Panis Angelicus, it is set to beautiful music, but it is not relevant to Christmas. In fact, it is often sung during Holy Communion, and particularly, at wedding and funeral Masses. Panis Angelicus is a Communion song in the Catholic Church, with the words of Saint Thomas Aquinas, written for the Feast of Corpus Christi. That feast celebrates the real presence of the body and blood of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist. Here is its English translation: Thus Angels' Bread is made the Bread of man today: the Living Bread from heaven with figures dost away: O wondrous gift indeed! the poor and lowly may upon their Lord and Master feed. *  Thee, therefore, we implore, o Godhead, One in Three, so may Thou visit us as we now worship Thee;* and lead us on Thy way, That we at last may see the light wherein Thou dwellest aye. Amen.  Source and translation of song from Wikipedia Panis angelicus - Wikipedia *Bolding added. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is the song Panis Angelicus considered a Christmas song? Because both the Eucharist and Christmas are Jesus becoming present on earth. At Christmas, Jesus became present on earth in human form, a unique event called the Incarnation. In the Eucharist, Jesus becomes present in every piece of bread consecrated at every Mass everywhere on earth, an infinitely repeatable event called transubstantiation. In a sense, the two are the same event. For the same reason, the Russian Communion hymn Salvation Is Created is sometimes sung at Christmas too. ",
