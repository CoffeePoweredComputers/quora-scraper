            "answer_text": "  1. Happy/sad music affects how we see neutral faces: We can usually pick if a piece of music is particularly happy or sad, but this isn\u2019t just a subjective idea that comes from how it makes us feel. In fact, our brains actually respond differently to happy and sad music. Even short pieces of happy or sad music can affect us. One study showed that after hearing a short piece of music, participants were more likely to interpret a neutral expression as happy or sad, to match the tone of the music they heard. This also happened with other facial expressions, but was most notable for those that were close to neutral. Something else that\u2019s really interesting about how our emotions are affected by music is that there are two kind of emotions related to music: perceived emotions and felt emotions. This means that sometimes we can understand the emotions of a piece of music without actually feeling them, which explains why some of us find listening to sad music enjoyable, rather than depressing. Unlike in real life situations, we don\u2019t feel any real threat or danger when listening to music, so we can perceive the related emotions without truly feeling them\u2014almost like vicarious emotions. 2. Our music choices can predict our personality: In a study of couples who spent time getting to know each other, looking at each other\u2019s top ten favorite songs actually provided fairly reliable predictions as to the listener\u2019s personality traits. The study used five personality traits for the test: openness to experience,extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and emotional stability. Interestingly, some traits were more accurately predicted based on the person\u2019s listening habits than others. For instance, openness to experience, extraversion and emotional stability were the easiest to guess correctly. Conscientiousness, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t obvious based on musical taste. To break it down, here is the connection they have found: Blues fans have high self-esteem, are creative, outgoing, gentle and at easeJazz fans have high self-esteem, are creative, outgoing and at easeClassical music fans have high self-esteem, are creative, introvert and at easeRap fans have high self-esteem and are outgoingOpera fans have high self-esteem, are creative and gentleCountry and western fans are hardworking and outgoingReggae fans have high self-esteem, are creative, not hardworking, outgoing, gentle and at easeDance fans are creative and outgoing but not gentleIndie fans have low self-esteem, are creative, not hard working, and not gentleBollywood fans are creative and outgoingRock/heavy metal fans have low self-esteem, are creative, not hard-working, not outgoing, gentle, and at easeChart pop fans have high self-esteem, are hardworking, outgoing and gentle, but are not creative and not at easeSoul fans have high self-esteem, are creative, outgoing, gentle, and at ease3. Music training can significantly improve our motor and reasoning skills:  One study showed that children who had three years or more musical instrument training performed better than those who didn\u2019t learn an instrument in auditory discrimination abilities and fine motor skills. They also tested better on vocabulary and nonverbal reasoning skills, which involve understanding and analyzing visual information, such as identifying relationships, similarities and differences between shapes and patterns. These two areas in particular are quite removed from musical training as we imagine it, so it\u2019s fascinating to see how learning to play an instrument can help kids develop such a wide variety of important skills. 4. Rhythm of Music and Motor disorder therapy: This motor power of rhythm may be especially strong in various forms of motor and impulse disorder\u2014and music can indeed be therapeutic here. Thus, patients with parkinsonism, in whom movements tend to be incontinently fast or slow or sometimes frozen, may overcome these disorders of timing when they are exposed to the regular tempo and rhythm of music.  5. Music training can structurally alter the brain:    Practicing a musical instrument can lead to numerous structural changes in the brain after only 15 months of training in early childhood. These changes correlate with improvements in certain motor and auditory skills. One area where these structural and functional changes occur is in the hippocampus (shown above), an area of the brain involved in learning and memory. A process that is critical for learning and memory in the hippocampus isneurogenesis \u2013 the formation of new neurons.  Musical practice may therefore enhance neurogenesis linked to improved learning and memory activity. Freidrich Nietzsche aptly said,\" Without music, life would be a mistake.\" ",

            "answer_text": "I can't offer a scientific answer - my response is as a musician who gets much pleasure from playing live music. Music makes me want to do various things like dancing relaxing or just listening depending on the tempo, volume and style of the music. The rhythm of music whatever style / genre is usually constant, which makes me satisfied and relaxed - whereas music with odd or disjointed rhythms have the opposite effect, I am uncomfortable and edgy.
