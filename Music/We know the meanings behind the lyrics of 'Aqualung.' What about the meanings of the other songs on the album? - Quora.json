            "answer_text": "\u201cCross-Eyed Mary:\u201d I\u2019d guess she\u2019s 14 or 15 but looks older. She goes to school but she\u2019s also a prostitute and escort, going to lunch in Hampstead Village\u2014nice place for lunch\u2014with businessmen. They probably get a kick out of the fact that she dresses well and looks older but is under age. A \u201cjack-knife barber\u201d performs abortions. CEM might have needed one or at least knows where to get one in her line of work. Highgate is an expensive London suburb, but of course has its share of the homeless. As the \u201cRobin Hood\u201d of Highgate, CEM makes a lots of money from rich businessmen and \u201cgives to the poor\u201d probably by giving a few quid to a number of homeless men she runs into regularly. \u201cCheap Day Return:\u201d Preston is in Lancashire, more city than country. A \u201cCheap Day Return\u201d is a train ticket to be used to get to a destination and back in a day. I\u2019ve seen Jethro Tull in concert four times, the last two in a smaller venue. Ian Anderson said the song came from a time he visited his father in a nursing home. The rest is pretty explanatory. \u201cMother Goose:\u201d The references here appear to be to a country fair. It sounds like the foreign student thinks Picadilly Circus is actually a circus. Hampstead Fair is a summer fair on Hampstead Heath. The speaker takes on different characters\u2014schoolboy, Long John Silver. He might be Aqualung, since Johnny Scarecrow is another homeless man (who nicked his raincoat from a snowman). \u201cWondr\u2019ing Aloud:\u201d A romantic little song, sort of a palate-cleaner after all the low-life narration. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only the giving that makes you what you are\u201d rates up there with some of the other epitomes of love in rock songs. \u201cAnd in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make\u201d from \u201cAbbey Road\u201d is the Beatles\u2019 contribution. The Moody Blues\u2014\u201dIt\u2019s not the way that you say it when you do those things to me. It\u2019s more the way you really mean it when you tell me what they\u2019ll be\u201d from \u201cQuestion\u201d is more wordy but epitomizes love. \u201cUp to Me:\u201d A \u201cWimpy Bar\u201d is not a pub for the ineffectual. Rather, it\u2019s the English equivalent of a MacDonald\u2019s, not that they don\u2019t have Macdonald\u2019s restaurants in England. The one I ate in in Haymarket was two buildings and three stories. A \u201cWimpy\u201d is a hamburger, named after the \u201cI\u2019ll gladly pay you Tuesday\u201d character from \u201cPopeye.\u201d The last time I had a Wimpy was 1979. It was a hamburger patty on a bed of onions on a bun and it did awful things to my stomach. One good point about Wimpy\u2019s is they seem to be open at all hours. I went on their site, chose \u201cMorden\u201d and they told me Indianapolis was \u201ctoo far to deliver.\u201d \u201cUp to Me\u201d has quite a jaunty melody to end side one. Of course, a \u201cSilver Cloud\u201d is a model of Rolls Royce. I used to try to connect the \u201cyellow-fingered smoky girl\u201d to Cross-Eyed Mary but without success. \u201cA half of bitter\u201d is of course English ale. \u201cAnd if it pleases me I\u2019ll put one on you man.\u201d means he\u2019ll buy the guy a beer. When I first heard it, I thought the lyrics were \u201cAnd if it pleases me, I\u2019ll put one on your fan,\u201d even though\u201dfanny\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to \u201cbutt\u201d In England, but something even more embarrassing. Side one is entitled \u201cAqualung;\u201d side two is entitled \u201cMy God.\u201d Religion might seem to be a pretty off- putting subject for rock music, hence the dearth of other religious rock tunes, but Anderson embraces the subject. \u201cMy God\u201d is moaning and melancholy. \u201cThe bloody church of England\u201d is the Anglican church, found by that champion of religion King Henry VIII. I\u2019ve been to Hampton Court every time I\u2019ve been to England. It\u2019s a short trip on the River Thames from Richmond, Surrey, where I stayed with my grandparents and survived Wimpy\u2019s. I\u2019ve been in the Maze, seen the Great Vine (I thought it was the \u201cGrape Vine\u201d), been passed all those gryphons, stared at the clock , etc. There\u2019s a great clip of what appears to be a ghost opening a door at HCP\u2014quite clear and spooky. The memory of Hampton Court that stays with me the clearest are the thresholds leading into (and out of) the great kitchens. They\u2019re one piece of stone laid across the doorway. The stones are worn away to a depth of perhaps an inch and a half. Thousands of feet over hundreds of years. Stones older than Mick and Keith. \u201cHymn 43:\u201d A quite personal hymn by Ian Anderson about Jesus Christ. Everything translates to American. \u201cSlipstream:\u201d \u201cSlipstream\u201d is 1:12 long, sort of a companion piece to \u201cWond\u2019ring Aloud\u201d in its brevity. It can stand alone as poetry, as can all of \u201cAqualung,\u201d laying the groundwork for JT\u2019s next album \u201cThick as a Brick.\u201d \u201cLocomotive Breath:\u201d Pretty raunchy lyrics, still sort of religious. I\u2019ve hear \u201cLB\u201d on the soundtrack at a drug store. \u201cOld Charlie,\u201d according to Anderson, is God. The song starts off with piano, a slow buildup, and features one of Anderson\u2019s finest flute solos. Name another rock singer/musician who regularly plays the flute. \u201cLocomotive Breath\u201d has been covered by several bands (W.A.S.P., Helloween and Styx). I always think of Warren Zevon\u2019s \u201cSwitchin\u2019 Yard\u201d as another classic rock representation of train noises (from \u201cExcitable Boy\u201d). \u201cWind-Up:\u201d \u201cWind Up\u201d again is religious and intensely personal, but I don\u2019t think there were too many young men (and women) in 1971 who didn\u2019t identify with the lyrics: \u201cHow\u2019d you dare to tell me that I\u2019m my father\u2019s son/ When that was just an accident of birth?/ I\u2019d rather look around me, compose a better song/ \u2019Cause that\u2019s the honest measure of my worth/ In your pomp and all your glory you\u2019re a poorer man than me/ As you lick the boots of death born out of fear.\u201d Ian Anderson now farms in northern England but still tours with the newest incarnation of Jethro Tull. If you have a chance to see them, do. You won\u2019t be disappointed. ",
