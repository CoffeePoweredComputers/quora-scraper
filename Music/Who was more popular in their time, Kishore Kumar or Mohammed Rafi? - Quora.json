            "answer_text": "Mohd. Rafi\u2019s career was active between 1944\u20131980 and Kishore Kumar was active between 1946\u20131987. However the trajectory of both of them was different. Mohd. Rafi was a classically trained singer, and thus competing with Talat Mehmood and Manna Dey, the established singers of 1940s. Mohd Rafi became the first choice for singer in 1950s and became popular that he sang thousands of songs. Kishore Kumar on the other hand was untrained singer, thus he had to struggle to establish himself amid classical singers of that time. Although Kishore Kumar established himself as a singer who could sing light non-classical songs, he became famous for his acting. Kishore Kumar became one of the lead comedian of that time. According to a radio show hosted by Annu Kapoor, Kishore Kumar was as successful in movies as Ranbir Kapoor is today. Kishore Kumar\u2019s singing career was mediocre till 1969. He had only sung songs for himself onscreen or to super star Dev Anand. His singing career spiked after 1969 block buster Aradhana. Around 1971 people started comparing Kishore Kumar and Mohd. Rafi. There were debated in magazines about who is better among the two. This suggest that Kishore Kumar became as successful and famous as Rafi was. Rafi was the highest paid singer till 1970 and this crown was then snatched by Kishore Kumar till 1987, his death. To sum up, Mohd. Rafi was the first choice in the times when our grand parents were young (1950\u20131970), and Kishore Kumar was the first choice when our parents were young (1970\u20131987). But in present day when they are no more, I think both are equivalently famous among young generation. ",

Mohammad Rafi sang the Lyrics were more powerful then the music. The time when Late Sh. Kishore Kumar came actively sang the Music was more powerful then the lyrics. By powerful i mean better & strong part of a song. Thanks. ",
