In the 21st century no doubt Hip Hop music is the best selling and profitable. As with the time we have changed us therefore our standard is also changed. Now we like to listen Hip Hop or Rock music. so it is the most benefited genre in the world of music right now. But also there is Classical Music. We cannot deny its importance. It has its own profits and benefits with all the time. Although it is a bit difficult but universal music. If you can work hard then classical music would also be the most profitable genre.  Music itself is not profitable. You make it as you want dull or boring, or interesting or inspiring. Work hard and one day your genre will be profitable. Gustavo Woltmann ",

            "answer_text": "If writing music for a production music library, contemporary music genres tend to get most usage per track in the early years whilst the genre is in-fashion then usage starts to tail off quite quickly as it goes out of fashion with editors selecting music for their film and TV projects In contrast classical music styles tend to have a lower short-term spike but have a much longer tail as classical music genres tend to neither be in-fashion or out-of-fashion and hence over the life of copyright (70+ years) may end up earning more than a formerly contemporary track which was in-fashion at the release date and then went out-of-fashion with users The tracks that make the most money are new contemporary genres which become classics - but that\u2019s almost impossible to predict without the benefit of hindsight many years later ",
