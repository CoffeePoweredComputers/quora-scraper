            "answer_text": " Harry Truman was a proficient classical pianist and at one point entertained the notion of going professional before he entered politics, according to David McCullough\u2019s biography Truman. In his brief career as a vice president, Truman went to visit some of the troops and got up on stage and began to play the piano. A young actress by the name of Lauren Bacall (20 years old at the time) was part of the professional entertainment and her manager convinced her to not only get on stage but on the piano with Truman playing. The troops, of course, went wild and the photo made all the front pages of the newspapers the next day. Harry\u2019s wife, Bess, was livid. Truman never played piano in public again. ",
