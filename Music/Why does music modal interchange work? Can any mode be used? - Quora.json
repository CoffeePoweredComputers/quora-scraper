            "answer_text": "Okay, I have to let you in on a little secret. ANY chord can be used to follow ANY other chord. They ALL work. Even the ones that aren\u2019t modally borrowed, but are completely foreign. Of course, there are ways that some work better than others. A friend of mine divides his harmonic universe into three levels, which he calls Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Level 1 is for diatonic chords and their tonicisations. Level 2 is for any modally borrowed chord that can\u2019t be construed as a tonicisation. Level 3 is for the foreign chords, that can\u2019t be construed as a borrowed mode of the home key. What you\u2019re talking about is Level 2, and yes, all those chords work. Some are easier to work with than others, for instance the major and minor triads are easier to work into a context than diminished or augmented triads, and the maj7 and m7 (four note chords) are easier to work in than the dominant 7 and m7(b5) types, but it can be done convincingly. Also, yes, all modes can work, including those weird modes of melodic and harmonic minor and hybrid modes (a tetrachord from one scale, and the other tetrachord from another scale). I\u2019m not going to say you will LIKE them all, but they are all usable somewhere. Non-triadic structures work too, but that is getting a little ahead. I know what you\u2019re thinking, and it is probably something like, \u201cWell, if ALL chords can work, why bother dividing them down into modally-borrowed chords at all?\u201d It\u2019s because all those Level 2 chords kind of sound like they are in the same club. They don\u2019t sound identical, but they all sound like they are part of the same family tree. The diatonic chords have a sound and feel to them, the modally borrowed chords all have a different sound and feel, but still sound related. The Level 3 (foreign) chords have yet another sound and feel, like they are distanced somewhat from the first two groups of chords. It is useful for that reason to group them together. Also, in my experience, Level 1 and 2 together are by FAR the most common chords in a lot of today\u2019s music, so it only makes sense to shine a light in the place where you\u2019re going to be looking a lot.

            "answer_text": "To clarify the question and the answer, we should have an example. I think the question doesn\u2019t refer to playing the same notes with different tonal center. That would be the case if the C major scale is used and you play the diatonic chords with Roman numbers I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII by shifting the C major chord in root position upwards using only the white keys on the piano. You would get C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor and B diminished. These chords all fit into a given piece because they share the same accidentals and belong to the C major scale. But when you play those notes you are using the scales of C ionic, D dorian, E phrygian, F lydian, G mixolydian, A aeolian and B locrian, which all have zero accidentals. I think the question refers to using C major as root and then e.g. a C lydian chord. That would be from the scale with C,D,E,F#,G,A,B,C. I would say that you can interchange such chords as long as it sounds like you want it to sound. If you are using dissonant sounds like F and F# in melody or chords together, it can sound good or it can sound bad, depending on the chord, the voicing and the purpose or style of the music. The soundtrack of the movie Troy has some nice lydian sounds when the city appears on the scene. Imagine the piece would be in the key of C. The melody plays the C lydian scale up to G and then down again. They use a D major chord when it comes to the F# in the melody from the C lydian scale. D major is not part of the diatonic C scale, instead D minor is. But D minor has an F in it, so it doesn\u2019t go well with the heroic epical piece with F# in the melody. The F and F# together would be too much Jazz for the ancient Greek hero Achilles. So they used D major, which has a F# in it and the tune is more heroic. Aside from the fact that these scales have Greek names, maybe lydian is a good fit for the ancient Greek hero\u2026. Hmmm, maybe film composers know what they are doing\u2026 If that is not what you were asking for, please give us an example. ",
