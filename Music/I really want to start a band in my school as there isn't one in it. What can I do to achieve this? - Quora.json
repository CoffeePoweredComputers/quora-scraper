            "answer_text": "School bands actually are quite a popular concept so if you initiate the idea in a right manner, you should be able to get your school authorities to agree to let you make a school band. First, you need to have all members of the band ready. If you require a total of 5 people, you should have them. They should know they're a part of the band, (naturally) and should be ready to it. Only then can you proceed further.You should speak to your school\u2019s music teacher first. If your school doesn't have one (which is very less likely), speak to a teacher who stands as moderate level of authority, like the HOD of a certain department that would help you out with such matters and is an approachable person.Often, when you speak to a teacher, you get to know if it is feasible to make a band and if there is a probability your principal will like the idea.After this, if the music teacher/ whichever teacher you spoke to, supports the idea, speak to your principal with prepared valid points of how a school band will make a difference and why should (s)he allow it. Prepare answers to retailiations (s)he is likely to make.If your school authories like the idea, you most probably will have a school band then. :) ",
