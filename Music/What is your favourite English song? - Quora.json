            "answer_text": "1Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen  It's one of the greatest songs ever made, totally captivating lyrically and extremely innovative musically all due credit to the Queen himself, Freddie Mercury. Simple put; this is the song with every element required.M+2167 Not one of the greatest but simply the greatest even if one includes classical music.M+104 When the writer of this song, the late Freddie Mercury had come into this studio with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the rest of the band had thought of it foolish, bizarre and odd---but went along with the \"Fred thing\"---now it is a masterpiece that has withstood time, even more than thirty years old----nothing, and no one has come close to re-creating something so tongue-and-cheek, innovative, and still makes teenagers want to bang their heads and air-guitar while driving. Simply the best. 2Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin  The poetic storytelling nature of Robert Plant's lyrics combined with Jimmy Page's brilliant musical composition places \"Stairway To Heaven\" as the number one rock song of all time. Mr. Page's arrangement of a dramatic crescendo type development with the song passing through stages along the way lend to his (and John Paul Jones) influence by classical music. His guitar solo in this song is one of his greatest played with undeniable passion and ease. \"Stairway To Heaven\" is a legendary song composed and performed by the greatest rock musicians of all time, Led Zeppelin. 3Smells Like Teen Spirit - Nirvana  I love this song. Nirvana is one of my favourite bands ever! I really miss Kurt CobainM+657 This isn't even close to being Nirvana's best song, never mind the best song ever. Hell, this is probably one of the worst songs of Nevermind. If everyone would step away from the overplayed Nirvana singles, and look at their great, underrated songs like \"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\" or \"Oh, The Guilt\", than a much better Nirvana song would be #4, not Smells Like The Only Nirvana Song You Know... - 4Imagine - John Lennon  Hey you! It is totally incomprehensible that Bohemian Rhapsody is the first. Imagine is the song of all centuries, Queen and John Lennon aren't competitors because John Lennon is god and Queen is just the queen. So Imagine is the first-it's objective reality 5Hotel California - Eagles  Awesome lyrics with great music makes this song a perfect songI used to hear it more than 20 times a day... such a beautiful song and this was the song that made me die hard fan of eagles 6Sweet Child O'Mine - Guns N' Roses  Genius intro and solo by SLASH AWESOME vocals by AXL ROSEAmazing work on rhythm by IZZY StradlinBadass awesome drummer Steven AdlerCool bass by DUFF,... SIMPLY AMAZING SONG ONE OF THE BEST SONGS OF ALL TIME,... G N'R ROCKS 7.One - Metallica  Amazing and moving, appealing to fans of thrash, metal in general, even pop fans... you can't help but be swept up in the epicness of it 8Comfortably Numb - Pink Floyd  Great guitar solo, great lyrics, great song 9Like a Rolling Stone - Bob Dylan  This song takes you on a hallucinatory 3rd eye journey, like all these songs do. Part of it could be about a great beauty. Go on girl, take your chances. Picture her there, on her throne, haughty, naughty, and drunk on herself, as others are. How could she not? Surrounded by legions of so called friends and admirers. Now picture them there,10 or so odd, years later. Their throne, now a gutter, bloated, lying face down in it. Like so many before. No body will know, that you were a beauty, a sweet sweet beauty, but stone stone cold! And all your so called legions who cared, your blood is in their mouths. They had a front row seat, to the circus that was your life. But the crowds have dispersed, and the tent must come down. Till the next beautiful circus ( YOU) comes to town. Because you still have the devil to pay.. And dear God, NO you can never go home again. It wasn't really that great there, at home in the first place. 10Hey Jude - The Beatles  Honestly almost any Beatles song could be on the list! But surely this one is classic. ",

            "answer_text": "It is both difficult and unfair to choose ten songs from so many great tracks around. But if I do have to get choosy and pick my personal favorites, here\u2019s how the top-ten list would go (not necessarily in this order though!) Chasing cars by Snow PatrolAll the passionate and fiery youngsters about to start their journey of love will agree to what Gary Lightbody has to say. Let's waste timeChasing carsAround our heads I need your graceTo remind meTo find my own If I lay hereIf I just lay hereWould you lie with meAnd just forget the world? All I want by KodalineJames Flannigan delivers quite a strong and beautiful message. No need to be embarrassed if you are ugly. It is okay to be different. Because someday, someone will appreciate you for what you are. Imagine by John LennonYes I know that it\u2019s quite tough to imagine- no more religion, no more country, no more politics. But John, you are definitely not the only one. While my guitar gently weeps by The BeatlesWell George, I do hope many more blokes awaken the love in them and keep making the world a better place. Bohemian Rhapsody by The QueenOh Freddie boy, what exactly did you have in your head when you wrote this piece? Even I don\u2019t understand some of the lines. But they are most amusing to hear. Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango Galileo Figaro \u2013 Magnificooooooooo Bismillah! No we will not let you go \u2013 let him go Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me. Comfortably Numb by Pink FloydArdent Floyd lover and a guitar solo fanatic, I adore this piece of Gilmour. Particularly the gig, Gilmour and Waters did at the Royal Albert Hall. Space Oddity by David BowieSome day, I hope to blast off into space listening to this and meet Major Tom there. Raise a glass with him perhaps ;) Blowin in the wind by Bob DylanPerhaps the most popular of Dylan\u2019s songs after A rolling Stone, this is said to have been written by the times rather than any individual living in those times. Quite right, I agree. I bet my life by Imagine dragonsBen and Daniel have rightly pointed out that what needs to be done, needs to be done. There comes a time when we have to bet our life- take that risk- go after that dream- maybe this is not what others would want us to do. But this is my calling,and I shall do it. Seasons in the sun by Terry JacksAs someone once said, this is a sad song about death that refuse to die. Although the one by Westlife is the happier one, I like the Terry Jacks\u2019 version more.
