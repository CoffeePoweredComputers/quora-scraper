You\u2019re not utilizing the best promotional format If you\u2019ve already promoted your videos through another service like YouTube TrewView, you should understand the kind of placements you\u2019re using. TrueView utilizes in-stream, in-slate, in-search and in-display formats. In-stream ads or pre-rolls are typically intrusive and interrupt a viewer\u2019s experience. Read More  In-slate ads aren\u2019t much better. A viewer must choose an ad to watch before they can get to their desired content. In-search and in-display ads appear on the sidebar of related videos or when someone searches for specific content. Ultimately, these formats do not encourage interaction or social sharing, and can cause negative associations with your content. This is why you need to invest in opt-in video advertisements. These kinds of ads aren\u2019t force fed to viewers\u2014people actually have to initiate a video play. When presented with opt-in video ads, viewers are more likely to watch the entire video as well as engage with the content via social shares and conversations. 2. You\u2019re not delivering your content to the right audience You may be under the impression that sharing your video across a few social media sites will earn you a ton of views. This is not the case. Once your friends have watched your video, it will get buried in their Twitter and Facebook feeds never to be seen again. If you\u2019re lucky, your friends might give your video a few hundred views. Read More But what if you want more than that? What if you want to build a solid fan base for your video content? You have to deliver your online videos to the right audience. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a video gamer and have a YouTube channel dedicated to gaming videos. Your goal should be to deliver your videos to an audience of gaming enthusiasts as these people will give you the most meaningful views and social engagement. Doing this on your own, however, isn\u2019t an easy task. How do you get your video onto sites that gamers frequent? Well, that\u2019s where we come in. You can use the ViralGains platform to serve your videos to relevant, highly targeted individuals (in this case video gamers) who are going to love and share your content with friends. This will boost your presence amongst the gaming community and help you to develop a dedicated following. 3. You don\u2019t boost your social proof in a right way  Social proof is always something that we all should focus on if we want to gain more views on our channels. However, not anyone knows how to boost their social proof in a right way. And I think you may use wrong ways to boost your social proof. So if that\u2019s true, I guess it\u2019s time for you to fix it. I\u2019ll tell you how. You shouldn\u2019t hesitate to hire a marketing company like Sell Real Likes, which can give you strong guarantees such as 100% money back guarantee, 90 days retention guarantee and provide you with high-quality services, to boost your social proof.
