            "answer_text": "If I may refine the question a bit, \"Why has the saxophone not been used more in orchestral music,\" is an interesting question with an interesting answer.  Basically, the saxophone is not widely used in orchestras because of business practices and politics of the 19th century Paris music scene.  The custom among instrument manufacturers in Paris at the time was to fit parts together from specialists, then stamp their name on the bell. When Adolphe Sax moved to Paris from Brussels in 1841 he rejected this practice, making his instruments entirely in his shop. When the city's instrument makers learned of his break with the status quo, they apparently weren't very happy. Since the rival instrument makers often had contracts with the best musicians in the city, they used this to their advantage. For example, Gaetano Donizetti had a contract and plans to use Sax's instruments in his opera Dom Sebasti\u00e9n. The members of the orchestra complained\u2014and according to one source threatened a walk out\u2014and the instruments were not used. There are also reports that Sax's shop was broken into, with plans and models either stolen or damaged. Of course, Sax could be quite stubborn, disagreeable, and litigious himself. It's no wonder that the saxophone did not join the orchestra in this environment. (There are other stories like the Donizetti example above.)  Opposition to Sax's instruments did not, however, extend to the military\u2014soldiers were in no position to stage a walk out. Once the saxophone was adopted in France's military ensembles, it's use soon spread, and is now used in military bands throughout the world. Due partly to the influence of the military band, the saxophone has also became a staple member of the concert band, as well as school and community bands.  ___________I originally did this research for a paper in college.

            "answer_text": "Why has the saxophone not been used more in classical music? Before answering the question, some food for thought: Why wasn\u2019t the machine gun used by more Roman Legions in the years leading up to the reign of Julius Caesar? Why didn\u2019t Michelangelo use spray paint to paint the Sistine Chapel? Why didn\u2019t Hannibal cross the Alps in tanks instead of using elephants? Why didn\u2019t Marco Polo visit the United States when he left China? Why didn\u2019t Napoleon just drop an atomic bomb on Moscow and claim victory? Now, on to the main event\u2026. Classic Period: 1750 - 1820 (ish). Adolphe Sax: 1814 \u2013 1894. First patent for the saxophone: 1846. Answer to the question: The saxophone was invented well after the end of the Classic Period. Don\u2019t confuse just any old piece of music played by an orchestra with Classical music. The Renaissance, Baroque, Romantic, and Modern /20th Century/Contemporary Periods surrounded the Classic Period. There is a reason there are many different periods in history, based at least in some part on the instruments available at the time. Many modern compositions call for saxophones, especially from French composers, but it is primarily used for jazz and rock. One hundred years from now, when people reflect on the Classic Period of Rock and Roll, the saxophone will be featured prominently. ",
