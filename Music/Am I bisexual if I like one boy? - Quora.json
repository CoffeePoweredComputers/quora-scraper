            "answer_text": "If you are sexually attracted to girls as well, and you are sexually attracted to this one boy, you could very well be bisexual. I\u2019m guessing you are very young. It\u2019s likely that there will be other boys that you will also like, but you are still too inexperienced to have met them. So just give it time. If you get to be quite a bit older, and it turns out you just love women but this is the one and only boy in your entire life that you have ever \u201cliked,\u201d you might decide you aren\u2019t bisexual. Every once in a while, a straight person has a single exception to their straightness. But you won\u2019t know that for years. Why worry about it now? Like who you like, and be open to anything that you feel. Being straight, gay and bisexual are all exactly of equal value and worth, so however it turns out will be great. For the record, I would love to be bisexual. But it\u2019s just not the way I am - I don\u2019t feel any attraction to women. So be it. ",

It wasn\u2019t because I thought they were handsome/hot/attractive, or anything like that. I still have no idea what was/is responsible for flicking this switch in my head. With all three of these guys I mentioned, I had no desire to get intimate with them, but I experience sexual urges. Does this make me bi? Who cares, I certainly don\u2019t. ",

If you are female and gay or male and straight, then you are bisexual if you want to be sexual with him. If you are male but only want to be sexual with males, then you are not bisexual, but gay. Keep in mind that SOME straights and gays want sex with only ONE person and nobody else. ",
