            "answer_text": "*Okay, here\u2019s a short bio\u2026 I hope you will understand after you read this. She is an incredibly strong woman who has been through so much crap and has both endured it and remained insanely selfless, generous, loving, and in my opinion pretty humble for being that amazing\u2026 * Here we go: Ariana Grande-Butera, 100% Italian, grew up in Florida. She began singing from a very young age and when she was 8, the same year her father left her and her family, she sang the national anthem at a Panther\u2019s game. By the time she was 15, she was cast in a Broadway musical called \u201c13\u201d and touring all around in over 100 shows. But when that was over, she was soon after cast in a Nickelodeon show called \u201cVictorious\u201d, which became very popular and was her first rise to fame. Her name started to become known. After Victorious ended, a second sequel show came out and she starred in \u201cSam and Cat\u201d (where she played Cat). The shows had some songs and vocals in them as well and the fans of the show noticed her vocals. Before she got officially signed, she did a cover of a Mariah Carey song called \u201cEmotions\u201d and posted it on YouTube, where it went viral. Immediately after she got signed, and was even compared to Mariah Carey and people said that she did the cover even better than Mariah Carey herself. After she got signed she released her first single \u201cPut Your Hearts Up\u201d (which she later grew to hate) and also her first album \u201cYours Truly\u201d which debuted #1 on the Billboard 200, even as her very first songs and albums, and it went on to reach platinum status. In just a few years, Ariana went from a theatre kid to an international pop star and actress. When she was 22 and immediately after she had released her first album and was heard, she was asked to perform at the White House along with the most legendary vocalists of the last 60 years. She was the youngest asked to perform by about 20 years, and she blew away the people there. She even got a standing ovation from Obama and his wife (and everyone else, as well). People were even tearing up when she started singing a Whitney Houston song (one of her greatest inspirations as a kid). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv_Klu0tsfEWhile she was writing her next album, her fame continued to grow when Justin Bieber asked him to open his show for him while he was on tour. She also began to date rapper Big Sean and then released her second album \u201cMy Everything\u201d, that featured him. \u201cMy Everything\u201d also hit #1 on the Billboard 200. She had collaborations with many more mature people on this album and started to get a more mature voice and develop her own unique personality and style (in music, in clothing, in personality) since she was now finished with her Nickelodeon career. Her album was a diverse R&B flavored record with traces of pop, hip hop, rap and more with her amazing vocals. However, in a song called \u201cBest Mistake\u201d, Ariana and Big Sean sing that even though they know the relationship isn\u2019t going to last they\u2019re going to keep it going as long as possible. They\u2019ve realized they\u2019re not the best fit for each other and that it wasn\u2019t meant to be. Ariana broke up with him mainly because she was upset about what he told the world about her and what he showed about her - which was mainly him speaking of her in a sexual way instead of as a person with emotions. This upset her and made her feel like he was either using her or cared more about her sexual body than for her personality. This deeply hurt her and made her go through heartbreak, because she loved him but she didn\u2019t feel like he loved her the same way. So she broke off the relationship. Here is \u201cBest Mistake\u201d, live with Big Sean:  2 years later, in 2016, Ariana started dating Mac Miller, who had been one of her best friends since she was 19. They had a very sweet relationship and it began to get very serious. People (even themselves) thought they would get married. In the midst of her serious relationship with Mac, Ariana released her third album, \u201cDangerous Woman\u201d, in 2016, and it sold just as well as anything she had put out previously. However, it only hit #2 on the Billboard 100 because already famous Drake released his album in the same week. Ariana\u2019s album was noticeably more confident than anything she had ever made before. It was also more honest and more herself than anything she had ever done before. Tragedy struck on May 22, 2017. While Ariana was in Manchester, England, touring for her Dangerous Woman album, an Islamic terrorist detonated a bomb, which killed 23 people and injured 140. Almost half of the people killed were under the age of 20, including many children whose parents had to see them killed. Out of 140 hospitalizations, 80 were children. The whole concert went into disarray. Everyone began fleeing the building. Ariana was broken inside, feeling so much grief she said \u201cshe couldn\u2019t form words\u201d. She took the blame for the deaths on herself, which made everything worse for her. She visited each family in the hospitals of the people who were injured and mourned with the families who had lost their children, hugging them and crying with them. She began to raise millions of dollars to put on a benefit concert for the families who had lost and been injured and all the survivors of the bombing. The concert was called One Love Manchester. She performed for millions of people who watched songs to honor the victims and she asked several other pop artists alongside her to join her and perform. The concert raised 13 million dollars and Ariana gave millions more of her own money to the victims and their families. All the money went to them. Ariana was severely shaken up and had terrible mental and anxiety problems after the attack. Terrorist bombing your own concert would not only be mentally scarring and terrifying (people described the scene of the bombing Ariana witnessed where people were pulling nails of children and woman\u2019s faces and bodies from the bomb). You can imagine not only how this mentally and permanently scarred Ariana, giving her PTSD and anxiety much worse than you could probably imagine, but also the amount of fear everyone at Manchester would have felt at that moment, including Ariana. Definitely more fear than most of us could ever imagine, and I really don\u2019t want to. In addition, of course this was Ariana\u2019s concert and as you might expect Ariana felt the weight of these deaths and it pained her and broke her so much to see it, and she was blaming it all on herself. You can imagine I\u2019m sure the thoughts that would be running through her head \u201cits my concert that killed them\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the real killer because it\u2019s all my fault for becoming famous and putting their lives in danger\u201d \u201cI just ended children\u2019s lives who had futures and families because of my own concert\u201d \u201cit\u2019s all my fault\u201d. Not only did she take the blame on herself and have PTSD from it, but she also taught herself how to overcome, and quickly as a strong woman does. Mac Miller immediately comforted her and spent time comforting her after the attack. However, Ariana told her manager that she could not let herself give into fear and she decided that to stand up to terrorism she must keep her Dangerous Woman tour going on. And although she struggled (even the fans could tell when she was performing onstage for the shows after that), she succeeded, completed her tour, and then went MIA for a while. She stayed quiet, took a break, and went to therapy for almost a good year. She was severely shaken up mentally and emotionally and still felt so much blame after the attack. Then, in a surprise reappearance, Ariana released her first song after a year, called \u201cNo Tears Left to Cry\u201d. The lyrics showed what her mindset was in recovering from being \u201cso sad and so depressed and crying so much that you have no tears left\u201d, which is her saying that when she couldn\u2019t cry anymore, she realized that she just has to choose to be happy. And to choose joy always, even in the face of hardships and sorrow. She describes herself as choosing joy and now she is \u201cout here vibin\u2019... yea, we vibin\u2019\u201d. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNcDkT_AoHQHowever, Mac Miller had a serious drug addiction. While Ariana wrote her 3rd album she struggled in the relationship \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d as she said it. With him, everything was fine. She loved him so much. But his addiction was causing problems and it wasn\u2019t helping their relationship. She begged him many times to stop the addiction for her. He loved her and called her \u201can angel\u2026 the strongest and sweetest woman i\u2019ve ever met\u201d, praised her often, and then were very close for the 2 strong years of their relationship; they grew so close to each other and got around 20 matching tattoos. However, Ariana felt like she was in a toxic relationship, and was really upset when she got so much hate after she broke off the relationship. She wrote in reply to a hate comment \u201chow absurd that you minimize female self-worth by saying that someone should stay in a toxic relationship because he wrote an album about them, which btw isn\u2019t the case (only Cinderella is about me). I\u2019m not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel like they need to be. I have cared for him and tried to support is sobriety & prayed for his balance for years (and always will of course) but shaming/blaming a woman for a man\u2019s inability to keep is crap together is a very major problem. Let\u2019s please stop doing that. Of course I didn\u2019t share about how hard or scary it was.\u201d She felt very scared in that relationship because of his addictions, and it was mentally really hard on her. She decided to put her mental health first and take the reality of what was actually happening in that relationship and not pretend that everything was okay when it wasn\u2019t. She loved him so much but guessed he didn\u2019t love her enough to stop his addictions, and when the relationship was toxic and mentally abusive for her, she had all rights to take a break with him. Of course, because of her breaking up with Mac she got just more hate from the world than a bunch of hate comments. In fact, the amount of hate she had already gotten in her lifetime up to this point is insane. You maybe be thinking \u201cyeah, just like literally any celebrity\u201d. But it\u2019s to the point where the most honestly sweet and genuine things she does people say she is doing it for clout, that she\u2019s fake, and that she is a diva. Many people claim she was never genuine in the Manchester fundraiser. In fact, I\u2019ve had Ariana haters go so far as to say that Ariana bombed her own concert so that she could have a benefit concert for clout. That is literally insane and disgusting, and the rest of her life speaks and screams the opposite message, especially how she acts, how she lives, and how she inspires. I\u2019ll say more about this at the end of the bio. When she turned 24, she began to spend time with an SNL comedian Pete Davidson, who she had met before and spent time with some years previously. She had joked to her manager before this that \u201cim gonna marry him one day. We\u2019re getting married\u201d. Actually, they met again, began to spend time with each other, and fell in love so deeply that later on Pete proposed to her. They were engaged. In their time of engagement they spent every moment with each other, got 5 matching tattoos, and their fans watched them getting closer and closer to each other. But of course, for this Ariana got more hate. Ariana got hate when she dated Mac, when she broke up with Mac, and now when she was getting together with Pete. In fact, in every relationship, and even in her most honest moments like the benefit concert she put on, she always got hate. It was very unfair to her and it made her even stronger long for equality, because she felt that she was always the one getting hate because she was the woman of the relationship. It may have been true, at least it seemed like it, because the men never got any hate. For example, Mac could have gotten hate for not being able to stop drugs, for letting a girl fall in love with him and putting her through stuff as he struggled with drugs, and Pete could have gotten hate because people easily could have thought he was trying to steal Ariana away from Mac. No. Ariana always got the blame for everything. It didn\u2019t help with her already emotionally unstable and traumatized self. What Ariana felt like in the relationship with Pete was what she described as \u201csecure\u201d. It appealed to her how wise and mature Pete was and it made her feel safe and strong when she was with him. Of course, this isn\u2019t all she said about him and definitely not the only reason for why she loved him, but this was something she added to an interviewer once. While she was in her relationship with Pete, she dropped her fourth album \u201cSweetener\u201d. (Besides for her Christmas albums from before, but those don\u2019t really count haha). Sweetener had the biggest first streaming week for any female artist ever, with over 125 million streams in the first week. Many of the songs were very deep and honest of what she had been through, is going through, and about her current relationship with Pete. More tragedy struck Ariana when Mac Miller died of a drug overdose just 3 weeks after the release of Sweetener. She was blamed for his death, and there were even articles everywhere saying \u201cAriana caused Mac Miller\u2019s death when he was only 26\u201d. She was not only heartbroken and now had more trauma to face with his death, but getting blamed for it (and im sure blaming herself as well) was too much for Ariana to bear. She tried to get through with her relationship with Pete while also trying to speak out as much as she could for Mac and how much she loved him. She posted so much about him and spoke so amazing of him but also of how sad she was\u2026.she didn\u2019t have to even say it because everyone knew and could tell. She posted photos of them together and of him laughing. What is even more heartbreaking is the trauma she went through after this, the amount of time she spent alone crying every day, and that Mac Miller\u2019s mother reported that his phone had 128 missed calls from Ariana after his death, where she called him every day several even though she already knew he was dead. This is heartbreaking. Here is something she posted on Insta weeks after his death \u201ci adored you from the day i met you when i was nineteen and i always will. i can\u2019t believe you aren\u2019t here anymore. i really can\u2019t wrap my head around it. we talked about this. so many times. i\u2019m so mad, i\u2019m so sad i don\u2019t know what to do. you were my dearest friend. for so long. above anything else. i\u2019m so sorry i couldn\u2019t fix or take your pain away. i really wanted to. the kindest, sweetest soul with demons he never deserved. i hope you\u2019re okay now. Rest.\u201d That is all she wrote along with a video of him. While going through this tragedy, she began to write thank u next. After trying for several weeks to stay with her relationship with Pete, her heartbreak for Mac was too much to bear and she broke off the engagement. She felt so bad for Pete having to endure watching her cry for someone else, but also crying for someone else at the same time, that she felt so confused and alone and terrible she had to break off the engagement. At this time, she soon dropped thank u, next, an ode to all her exes and how each one of them has taught her something and made her a better person, and how she is grateful for all of them, and instead of being sad about her failed relationships, she chooses to learn from them and be grateful for them because of what she learned from each and every one of them, what they have taught her and how they have helped her to become a better person. Not only this, but she specifically calls each one of them out BY NAME in her song and says specifically what they taught her, and concludes that for now she has \u201cari\u201d, herself, and how she\u2019s good with that and excited to take time for herself and work her crap out, basically, for once in her life and give herself some love back (well, maybe that\u2019s more the theme of the whole album\u2026 :) ). The thank u, next album opens up about her mindset in working through everything that she has been through. Heartbreaks, tragedies, deaths, even still working through and reflecting on her whole life. Here is one main theme we all saw in listening to the thank u next album, although every song is about something different that shows exactly what her mindset has been like through this tragedy, and the different stages she\u2019s gone through, and you can see how genius her mind is in dealing with crap and also how relatable some things can be and how it has both helped me and tons of other girls and fans to get through things. But the song on the thank u, next album that shows what it was like for her after Mac\u2019s death but still with Pete is the most heartbreaking song, called ghostin. Here are the lyrics (and her angelic voice in so much pain): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OM0hodCR5cNo matter what haters who don\u2019t know enough about Ariana say or haters who don\u2019t look close enough at her or her life, the people who ACTUALLY know her talk about her like she is an angel, the most sweet and nicest person in the world. In fact, in almost every interview with people who know Ariana well, she is almost always called \u201cthe strongest woman\u201d multiple times. In addition, Ariana stands up for so many kinds of people. This not only includes standing up for women and taking on such a big role in this movement, but people that don\u2019t even affect her at all, which shows how selfless she is - this includes the homeless, people with AIDS and HIVS, and showing love and good treatment to the LGTBQ+ community, who are constantly feeling hated and alone. She speaks out to these people constantly, both directly to them, giving them her love no matter what, but also speaking out for them. She is a beautiful woman, whether you do or don\u2019t agree with what she stands for. In fact, there is a lot I don\u2019t agree with that she stands for, as a Christian myself, but I think her heart and her intentions are so beautiful for someone who could be much much worse. She is really an inspiration. She is known to just be loving to everyone, including fans she doesn\u2019t even know. She has influenced people in so many ways, including telling all her fans repeatedly and even individually that she loves them so much, that they are cared for and loved so dearly by her no matter what. That they are special and worth-it. She writes things like this in tweets to her fans at least once a day, and is one of the only celebrities who are always replying to fans and random users comments and starting conversations, writing so many \u201cI love you and am so grateful for you guys\u201d and all those kind of tweets, and is constantly taking time out of her day for fans. According to a source, she has probably saved thousands of girls lives from committing suicide and stopping self-harm because of Ariana\u2019s encouragements and how big of an influence she is on other girls of today. She is often private DM-ing fans who are asking for her for advice and she cares about their lives and listens to their stories and gives them advice along with a LOAD of love. She has bought fans coffee when she felt bad for them when they were waiting outside her hotel room in the cold, invited fans another time up to her hotel room for lunch, hangs out with fans, and even invited a fan to be in her music video for thank u, next. Just two random quotes, wish I had time to add a thousand million more :))):   That is the main idea of her bio, although definitely not everything. I just respect this woman so much, and I hope I have given the readers of this a little respect for her too. Plz leave a comment on your thoughts. :) Love you. Oh, I forgot. I don\u2019t really think that her talent vocally is a question\u2026 but, here is one of her first songs. And I just love her emotion wow. This is also proving that she can sing amazing live. literally amazing.  ",

            "answer_text": "l see there is good and bad but let me get out the good first! She has an amazing aesthetic!She looks great in absolutely everything she wears. Even her casual wear. I\u2019d never imagine her having to spend millions on clothing and accessories unless she absolutely wanted to. This dress here I believe only costed her $50. Her ponytail looks so good that I often forget that it is real.  2. I love how she went from Victorious to Sam and Cat to a multi-million dollar singer and model who has many award for her music. She continues to grow everyday as an artist and she\u2019s becoming something that most people never would have expected from her.  3. I love how she sacrificed her religion for her brother. Ariana adopted Kabbalah; a form of Jewish mysticism after knowing that her brother was gay. She was originally catholic and decided to change her religion because she didn\u2019t want to believe Frankie was going to hell. That was such a great sacrifice!  OK now here come the negative I don\u2019t like her strange urges to blackphish and be unnecessarily seductiveWe all know Ariana is not that dark! She\u2019s we\u2019ve seen her paparazzi taken pictures , her music videos and even old pictures that she\u2019s taken of her self. There is no way in the hell this girl is as dark as the picture below. In regards to her seductive behavior I feel like everyone is like this naturally but for her it isn\u2019t necessary at all. I really wish she didn\u2019t act this way. That\u2019s all I have to say in regards to that.  2. Her diva like really erks me. Yes! Ariana. We know. You\u2019re beautiful. You\u2019re talented. But please don\u2019t walk around acting like some angel that just fell from the sky! According to this article her life coach can\u2019t even work with her: Redirect Notice  3. I don\u2019t like how she mistreats some of her fans I\u2019ve watched many videos on YouTube in which Ariana straight up disrespects fans. Telling them not to touch her or hug her even if they\u2019re doing it out of sincerity, denying them pictures and saying she \u201c doesn\u2019t have time\u201d for them. Just be nicer to us won\u2019t you?  that\u2019s all. ",

I mean the whole donut licking thing and saying \u201ci hate America\u201d was a bit rude, and I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not very nice to her fans. Recently she told a fan to go \u201cShut The F*ck up\u201d because she made a joke about Victoria Justice, who played Tori on Victorious, which I\u2019ve seen many Ariananator\u2019s make plenty of times. So basically back in Victorious days, while doing some sort of interview with the cast of Victorious, Ariana was being praised for singing all the time on set and being an amazing singer, which she is, and Victoria said something along the lines \u201cI think we all sing.\u201d Many fans of Ari believed that Tori was being jealous of Ari since Tori has the weakest voice on the show, and ever since then it\u2019s been an inside joke amongst the fandom.   Now I don\u2019t know Ari\u2019s intentions, joking or not, this girl got a lot of hate because of Ari\u2019s tweet, and it was insensitive of Ari to post this. This girl is receiving so much hate and even gets death threats! Ari has a huge following, and some crazy fans, as every fandom experiences crazy fans, and it was wrong of Ari to do this. I lost a lot of respect for Ari for this. Yes, we all makes mistakes, but still with someone with a following like hers always should think before they call someone out like this. Also, by Ari saying this could\u2019ve really hurt the girls feelings if she took this the wrong way. This person explains some things about what Ari did that makes her come off as rude Hanna Diaz's answer to Why is Ariana Grande mean to her fans? this is is a comment under the answer I linked: \u201cAri is a hypocrite about racism becuase when Kris Wu\u2019s album passed Thank U,next her fans kept saying he was using bots and dragged her manager into the drama. Fans started tweeting racist comments like \u201cugly yellow sushi roll\u201d and Ari liked the tweet. After Kris Wu\u2019s management posted a letter about the drama, Ari and her manager never apologised to him\u2026\u201d  Over all she seems pretty rude, but I still Ike her music ",

She gives me chills every time I listen to her (which is quite a lot). Her talent makes me want to take a picture of that moment and never let goShe is so freaking kind to her fans!! I sent her a letter a couple of years ago and she responded with Omg bby ilysm ur so cute!! And she sent two signed photos which I treasure.She is so strong. You have the Manchester incident where she was completely terrified but yet still came back to do a support concert. She gained so much horrible PTSD from that yet she was brave enough to come back and face her fears. People saying it\u2019s her fault 22 angels died died that night (R.I.P \ud83d\udc1d\u2601\ufe0f\ud83d\udda4) should do their research. Then there\u2019s the Mac Miller incident which must have been completely heart wrenching for her. Imagine you were her and someone who you loved deeply died at sudden notice from something that you feel is completely your fault even though you know it isn\u2019t. Yes thousand of people die every day but that doesn\u2019t stop it from being horrible. And would you want all your feelings every minute of the day written about on social media? The times you cried and laughed and did something embarrassing? No. Ari was obviously torn apart by that.Yes she have had some awkward moments like when she licked that donut but she was drunk. Don\u2019t blame her for being drunk it\u2019s happened to us all at leat once in our lives. Yes she shouldn\u2019t have done it but when your drunk you don\u2019t really think straight do you? And anyway she apologised, she didn\u2019t mean to cause offence to anyone, and that was back in like 2016 or something. Can society even move on and forgive a slight mistake?She is so freaking funny! She makes me laugh so much! My favourite times were: scooch a mooch, I\u2019m a pizza I\u2019m a f*cking meatball, I\u2019m Ariana Grande and if that not good enough don\u2019t talk to me, getttt aaaaaaa lifffeeeeeeee!!She is a massive supporter of woman rights which I am too so that gives me all the more reason to love Ari!Some people find her voice annoying and her style, but that\u2019s Ari and if you don\u2019t like it don\u2019t have it because that is her, she won\u2019t change just for one hater. She won\u2019t change for a million haters because Ari is Ari. That is WHO she is, that defines her. If you want to hate go ahead but your a sick, sick human being.Its okay not to like her that\u2019s your opinion, but instead of being like the millions of haters, just keep your opinion to yourself\u2026.please? You know what happened to Caroline Flack, don\u2019t let it happen to anyone else.",

Well, first things first, her sleeves. She, for some reason, always wears REALLY LONG SLEEVES.  Some people have been making Ariana Grande sleeve memes and they are quite funny.  Her songs all sound the same. I dunno if it\u2019s her voice or her lyrics or whatever, but I swear, every single song of hers sounds the exact same as another. There was also the donut incident, where Grande licked donuts and put them back at a donut store. There are many reasons to dislike Ariana Grande, but I guess it\u2019s just a matter of preference. However, there have been times where I\u2019ve felt sorry for her - for instance, the Manchester attack and when Mac Miller died. Please don\u2019t criticise me - again, this is my opinion. ;) ",

Al though she is really attractive and cute I kinda do feel uncomfortable when I see her in reavling outfits because she looks and sound like a 13 year old. She also has a great voice I just watched her sing a cover of \u201cI have nothing\u201d and she was on fire but it was no where as good as Whitney's verison of the song. Sooo she is okay by my book I just don't listen to her. But then again I only listen to Michael Jackson Sooo if I had to rate her as a performer I would give her a 3/10 Again I don't watch her performances that much. This is just what I have seen and heard    Al though I wish she was nicer to her fans. ",

It has nothing to do with her voice or appearance, but rather her personality. So I have friends who have not only met Ariana, but interviewed her for their radio show. They told me she was incredibly arrogant/snobby while not on-air. She treated the hosts and producer like they were absolute garbage, that is until they were on-air. Then her personality totally changed to being sweet, cute and professional. Apparently her whole cute little sweetheart persona is all an act. Since she treated my friends that way, I\u2019ve boycotted her and her music. ",

I know many artists who use lots of symbolism and have deep topics I can usually relate to. Her songs come across as impersonal and nothing that really makes me feel anything. Even her personality just comes across as generic, and I didn\u2019t like that whole donut scandal either. It makes me think fame has gotten to her head sometimes. It\u2019s just my opinion and it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s bad, I just don\u2019t like her music and it\u2019s just my personal thoughts. ",

Also there\u2019s the fucking fact where she licked a doughnut to \u201cProve a point\u201d or some fucking shit like that, No amount of sorries could make me forgive her for that, what if someone accidently ate it and got fucking sick. Overall though, its just my opinion, its in no way suppose to shit on fans, im just stating why I hate Grande. ",
