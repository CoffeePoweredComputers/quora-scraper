            "answer_text": "Yes you can, this is my start in music\u2026 I've answered a lot of questions but added more depth to the journey but for this answer I'll stick to the outlines when it's relevant\u2026. Ok I began as a kid, just 14 so I had no money other than a few quid a week pocket money my computer was an Amiga gifted to me by my older brother years before, it was worth maybe \u00a350, my only audio output for producing was the monitor of the computer\u2026 for the next couple of years all my money went on blank floppy disks and tapes, after I released my first single on a small label a couple of years later, it had been produced with that \u00a350 computer, I made a little money from that release, not loads but at 16 I felt like I was rich, I spent \u00a3200 on a new \u201cstudio\u201d set up, what I actually bought was a newer model Amiga (second hand), a small TV because the old monitor wasn't compatible and a radio cassette with line in for amplification\u2026 that was my studio for several more years, I released a few more singles and remixes, I'd gotten into live performances to promote through the label, problem was I couldn't play any instruments, but I could make music by triggering keys on the Amiga, I had to learn to play an instrument, I opted for a keyboard so I could use midi on the Amiga, cost me \u00a390 but the interface would cost twice that, by that time I could probably afford it but instead I opted to take a free Atari even though it's software was a new learning curve, took a while to work it out but again I was soon releasing music again\u2026. By my tenth year I'd made some money, I made a single purchase of a pc with some of it and it cost me more than I'd spent on production gear in the previous 10 years\u2026. I've never made loads of money, enough to pay the bills but I've lost money too so I've always remained frugal to my music production, I have a pc, I have a controller , I have software, that's all I need, you don't need lots of money to make good music\u2026 you already have some kind of computer device if you posted on quora so that's 50% of the way there, get some software, there's plenty free ones out there on all platforms, a controller is optional but not essential, then all you need is a creative spark and will to succeed ",

            "answer_text": "You do the best you can with what you got! If you love creating music and have a passion for it you will find a way to work on any PC/laptop no matter how little money you have.  When I started out my PC was terrible, I could never do any projects with multiple synths because my computer couldn't handle it. So I just sampled tracks and did remixes till I could afford a decent computer. Creating music like this was a a lot easier on the processor.  So in short, do what you gotta do to fuel your passion! This could be the start of a great journey as a producer for you ",

            "answer_text": "it's great practical training to start out with minimal software, like GarageBand.  also, the lines between consumer and pro software have blurred. Lots of good music is recorded using computers and software years out of date, primitive gear, freeware. If you're talking about producing for hire, here are some relevant details: you'll be able to send stems to collaborators no matter what your software.  (but may not be able to open the highest rez files). at every level, there will always be clients unsatisfied with your gear collection - you'll always be pitching your services and track record... good luck!

            "answer_text": "It really depends on the genre of the music you want to produce, I personally started with Anvil studio, when I first started producing music, It's not as good and professional as Abelton, Logic pro or Reason, but it gave me a deep knowledge with notes and music theory, plus it's free. Once you get experience with the notes and basic music theory, save some money to buy a midi controller(if you don't own one) with Abelton, you can find midi controllers for less than 100 bucks, you will have some latency issues while recording, but you can overcome that if you save more for an audio interface and Studio monitors for the future. Remember that good music depends on the creativity of the composer and not the equipment or software he/she uses. ",
