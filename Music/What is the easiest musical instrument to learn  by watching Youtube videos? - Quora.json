            "answer_text": "You should, if you are monetarily able, pay for lessons for at least 2 to 3 years. If you have a good deal of musical experience on another instrument already, you could try to teach yourself. However it will always be easier with a teacher. The Irish penny-whistle can be very easy to play, however this is coming from an oboe player. The fingerings are mostly the same. Good luck! ",
