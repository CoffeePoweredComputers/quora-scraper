            "answer_text": "How to remove vocals from a song. Well here are a few ways: If u want absolutely no vocals, its best to download the instrumental versions of the song. The instrumental versions will be mostly recreations of the original song and played and recorded by a musician and then uploaded for sharing/ sellingIf u already have audio files(mp3 ,wav, wma etc) you can use various softwares to pass the song through their filters and remove the vocals and separate the instrumental music. Word of caution: It will not remove the vocals 100%. A shade of the vocal will still remain. Having said that if u want to play karaoke in a party situation the remaining vocals are very faint and nobody will notice. How to do this:Remove The Vocals From A Song Free Software to Remove Voice From Songs VLC PLAYER : I found it easiest to remove vocals from a song using VLC media player which is already a popular player and most people have it on their computer so no need to download any extra software (I use VLC 2.0.2 Twoflower, Get it here VideoLAN - VLC 2.0.2 Twoflower ) Steps: 1.Open vlc player 2.Press Ctrl+P .Preferences window will open up 3. In left lower corner select Show Settings >All 4.Select Audio >Filters 5. On the right side tick the box saying Simple Karaoke Filter Click Save and you are done. Now play any Music and it will remove the vocal from the song Caution: If u want to play everything normally again follow the same steps, untick the option and Save.  You can even have lyrics come on the screen just like on a Karaoke machine. You just need to have a subtitle file (.srt) of the song If u have a subtitle file of the song, well and good. But subtitles cannot be played with audio files normally. To do this, go to Audio > Visualizations >Scope. Now if your subtitle is named same as the audio file, it will automatically start displaying the lyrics. Otherwise Right click> Subtitles> Open file , then select the subtitle file wherever it is locatedIf you dont have it, you can create it if you want it that badly. Download DivXLand Media Subtitler . Google the lyrics for you song and simply copy the text. Open the software ,load the song from your computer, paste the lyrics you copied from the internet. Match the music and the text. You will take around 10 min for the first subtitles then it becomes easy. Once subtitle file is created save it in the same folder as your song. Its very easyHope that was helpful ",

            "answer_text": "There are some programs out there that claim to be able to remove elements from a mixed track and isolate them, but in practice they don't tend to work to well. What you wish to do is not yet fully achievable, but there may be some ways to get close depending on the source material. The most common trick to achieve this effect is to remove all information from the track that only exists in the stereo domain, using a trick called phase cancellation. Vocals tend to be placed in the centre of a mix, with instruments panned around the outside. By processing the track so that we can only hear what remains in the centre, we may get a result that consists mainly of vocals. Of course there are limitations to this. Other elements can be left in the centre too. It is fairly common for some of the drums, and bass lines to be in the centre of a mix. After you've removed a lot of the side information though, you may find that using an EQ gets you a lot closer to what you want. In my opinion a far easier way to get the result you want is to play a keyboard (or use a virtual one) along to the singer's melody, and work out what the notes are. This will require a little ear training, but not a great deal. Anyway, back to the phase cancellation trick. How you do it in practice depends on the software you are using. Here is an example of the technique used in logic express:  To find the correct method for your own software, type 'Isolate vocal phase cancellation (name of software)' into YouTube, and you should find a helpful video.

            "answer_text": "The following online sites are the best places to download background music for free. You will not be charged anything so never fall for the tricks of fraudsters out to make commercial gains. You will get the best background music regardless of where you plan to use it. #1. YouTube Audio Library This is the best place that provides access to over 150+ free background music grouped by mood, genre duration and instrument that can be downloaded as 320 Kbps MP3s. You can get it for your YouTube videos and elsewhere. #2. Audiojungle This is another place that you will get background music for free. Most of the musicians who have their music in this site offer it as royalty-free and you can get that from a section of the site labeled \"free files\". They also have monthly offers for top music tracks downloaded for free and you can capitalize on that. #3. Free Play Music As the name suggests, this website charges no fee for music downloaded and it is one that you can visit for all your background music. All the audio files are in the MP3 format but are generally compatible with several other formats. The positive side of this site is that you can search for all files you want to download easily. #4. Brainy Betty This is the right site to get background music specifically if you have PowerPoint presentations to make. That is the main category but there are several others that will open wide your considerations. You might not like it if you want files in any other format other than MIDI since that is the only one recognized here. However, they offer for an opportunity to convert to WAV or MP3 formats. #5. Audionautix You will get all genres of background music to download for free from this site. That is their biggest advantage because your options will not be limited to any genre. Unfortunately, you might get them bothering because they demand that for any music used from the site for whatever reason, you should give them credit which is all about protecting their copyrights. #6. Partners in Rhyme All the music downloadable from this site is free of charge even though they prohibit reselling, posting it for secondary downloading or remix it to distribute again. The only thing they ask in return after downloading the music freely is credits in terms of having the link posted in whatever place you use the music. WAV is the popular format used by the site since most of their songs are loops thus MP3 is totally incompatible. #7. RoyaltyFreeKings This is a great place from where background music is available to download at no cost. Most of their songs are well compatible with a big number of file formats and the site will only seek for credits once you use their tracks. #8. ildebe Even though this site does not offer satisfactory music tracks to download as background music, you will have a good option to consider. They have free music loops for a variety of genres and their formats are fully compatible. #9. GRSites This is the place where you will get any animal sound effect you want for free to use as background music. It is heavily loaded and you will be more than privileged to seek downloads from here. #10. Background Band You will get hundreds of background music from this website and only charge a lifestyle membership fee of $10. You will not be asked to pay for any track that you download from the site. You can use the music for commercial purposes with no restrictions which are the biggest advantage to enjoy for downloading music from this site. Those files are compatible with a wide variety of file formats. #11. TemplatesWise All the music offered at this site is downloaded for free and comes already converted into the MP3 format. That is an initiative they have taken to satisfy customers in advance. The only thing you will do is select the correct music genre, go for a music track under that and download. ",

            "answer_text": "As of 2017, an online service called Artificial Intelligence for Sound! can remove vocals for you automatically. I don\u2019t know who these guys are but it sounds to me like it\u2019s a quick route. If you\u2019re interested in DIY, keep on reading my answer. For voice removal (in random order): Combine L with phase-reversed R to monoApply fine-tuned, decisive EQ (e.g., mouse-drawn EQ / notch filter, with lots of DBs)Use Audacity's sampled noise filter (or Reaper\u2019s Reafir VST in substract mode) to remove specific soundsFor voice isolation, the best results I got involved: Resample to a lower frequency, for example 22KHzApply fine-tuned, decisive EQ (e.g., mouse-drawn EQ / notch filter, with lots of DBs) to remove all frequencies that are not within the human voice range; and the specific singer's voice rangeUse Audacity's sampled noise filter or Reaper\u2019s Reafir VST to remove specific sounds (like snare hits)Scan the song to find the most convenient part to sampleIf you end up with too little midrange, use some sort of \"exciter\" filter to rebuild the higher frequencies with harmoniesAt this point, it might sounds like a mess, but In the context of a remix/mashup - cover-up the glitches with effects.",

            "answer_text": "TL:DR - Use Chord Pulse and Audacity. I have created some tracks for existing songs:  As well as original backings:  And even some unique compositions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9l9Ioehnachttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fryBPfUTR9s So, if you want to have backing tracks for singing or instruments, follow different YouTube channels (including mine haha) and download Chord Pulse. You can always find backing tracks on YouTube or record your own instruments. You can search for the backing track without a specific instrument or vocals, or you can search for something called master tracks - if a song has bass, two guitars and drums alongside with vocals, you can search for separate master tracks for bass, one guitar, the second guitar and drums, download those with a YT to MP3 converter, then combine them in a software like audacity. You are essentially doing a puzzle and it takes some time but it gives much better results than simply using a software to remove vocals which kills the quality of the overall song. Now, maybe you want to create your own backing tracks with only software. One really good and easy software for that is Chord Pulse. You can choose the chords, tempo and tonality and set it up to be exactly as the song you want. Then you can choose from preset styles which change the instruments. It is really intuitive and easy to use if you have very basic musical theory knowledge. ",

I have had good luck with both those, but I haven\u2019t really used them a lot for performances etc. I had a mixer that did the same function real time. Haven\u2019t really used this technology very much. I have software to add words and create cdg (karaoke graphics) On one, only one occasion did I remove vocals from a song, add words to the file, and then use it in a performance. That\u2019s going on about 20 years. And like the other answers indicate, usually the vocal is not 100 percent removed and some of the other sounds are compromised It is just too easy to look for a Karaoke version of a song online. Spanish songs can be searched for using the term \u201cPista\u201d and Karaoke. Youtube has many of these. Other services can download these for like 99 cents a song. After getting a few SCDG discs and a couple of programs to rip songs off them and play them on my computer, I get the rest of my songs online. ",

Some karaoke machines and audio software selectively remove the characteristic frequencies of vocals using EQ, but that doesn't remove them, it just makes them quieter (and makes the remaining track sound strange.) As Jared said, you need acapellas and instrumentals. Very rarely, these will be available through mainstream retail channels like iTunes -- for example, you can legally download a ton of Michael Jackson acapellas. More commonly, you need to find \"white labels\" sold to club DJs, sometimes not completely legally. Another not-so-legal option is to search the web for DJ versions or stems ripped from games like Guitar Hero. I assume that games are the source of the stems on this site: http://www.studiomultitracks.com/ ",

A stereo track has some sounds in the center like voice and drum, flute and some parts of regular instruments and bass guitar ; and some sound panned in the sides like the reverbed instruments and reverbed vocals and any audio that is meant to be in the side like someone entering the screen/song from left side while talking,or some other sound. You can only eliminate the vocals and other sounds(instruments included, can't help) that are in the center. Some instruments get eliminated too. And the the reverbed vocals don't get removed bcz their some parts are in the sides. You can visualize and understand it. Software : Audacity ,best open-source DAW ,made by Carnegie Mellon University. No need to wait after downloading Audacity. 1. Go to preferences,then Libraries. There you need to download the two plug-ins : LAME and FFmpeg from Audacity website. Congrats! You are ready. 2. Upload any video or audio. Video better be raw hd and audio better be hq mp320kbps or hd WAV or FLAC. 3. Select any area that needs vocal-removed and go to effect.then scroll down and select \"vocal reduction and isolation\". 4. A tab opens. Select the followings. Action : remove vocals Strength : 0.70 to 1.00.....1.00 will be too dull so I do 0.70. Low cut for vocals : 1.0 High cut for vocals : 24000.0 Listen to preview and if you like the version,click ok. 5. Done. Export the Audio file to WAV file. it takes more space but audio will be lossless. ",

You can also go for MIDI file for the song but it will not be the same as original. MIDI sounds robotic. Another way is to get a Karaoke generating software. There are many of them available for free. I use Karaoke Sound Tools. Another one is Atomix Virtual DJ, which has a plug-in to block vocals. In this approach you can browse the song in the software and it will produce Karaoke file for you. But it is not efficient. It will work for some songs and will not for some. I'll not get into details because it is very technical and I don't know how much you know. But if you know a little bit about music production on computers then you can do it in one of the DAW. Below is the link that shows how to do that in FL studio.How to Isolate Vocals in Fruity Loops | eHowYou might also find some videos on youtube for FL studio. ",

This link explains how to do it: How to Remove Vocals From a Song Using Audacity | eHow  This technique takes advantage of the fact that on most pop music, vocals are placed front and center in the mix. If a track has the vocals mostly on the left or right channel, rather than centered, the technique will not work. And you may still hear some \"ghost\" vocals, or echo effects that were not centered. But if you're trying to create tracks that you can practice vocals against, or for cheap-skate karaoke, it will work just fine.  ",

Using these devices, MIDI Files provide excellent backing tracks and - MIDI Files can be edited to your pitch (key), tempo and instrument selection. Be aware if you play back a MIDI File using your laptop, IOS/Android device\u2019s own sound chip, the results will be poor. MP3 backing track files will play back on any device that plays an MP3 file, be it a computer, cell phone/tablet device and so on. if you are unsure of the difference between a MIDI File and MP3 Backing Track[5], I have written an article to explain.
