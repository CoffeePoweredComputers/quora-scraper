            "answer_text": "Both yes and no. The amount of revenue that is earned from streaming that actually ends up in the hands of the musicians is extremely low. Streaming has negatively affected other forms of music consumption such as physical sales and radio. Streaming has completely changed how the music industry works. 45+ years ago we had to go out and buy physical copies of new albums/singles and such, which we probably heard about from listening to the radio. Now we no longer have to do so thanks to the internet and streaming. Whatever is newly released is instantly available to everyone at a just few clicks. This has, in turn, negatively affected how music charts work. In the 1970\u2019s a single would be released, and through radio airplay support, people would enjoy the song and go buy the single or album. This meant that songs almost never debuted high on the music charts. Now, songs and albums debuting at #1 is commonplace. In my opinion, streaming shouldn\u2019t even be accounted when compiling the aforementioned charts because it causes false illusions of how popular something really is. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u201cmusic industry\u201d has always been a bit of a glitter show. So much money is taken away from the artist after income is earned its kind of a killing joke. There was never a glorious time for artists. Only the biggest artists who toured ever made he kind of coin you can retire on. With streaming its even worse\u2026..which you really couldn\u2019t think it could get\u2026.worse. Digital files have no tangible value. Data downloaded on a device has no tangible value. Now you can subscribe to a service with a giant napter hard drive of tunes and listen to what ever you want just as long as they cover what you're interested in. Streaming services is killing the notion of the album and in many ways certain genres of music that don\u2019t produce a ton of clicks. Its become the 50s again. Singles. Simple overproduced easy to sing along to singles, with very little focus on instrumentation. Something that sounds great on a smartphone. Its the same with dance music and Beatport. Stuff beings to sound too similar, but from what I see the youth is not so demanding with what they listen too, and young artists who are shooting for \u201cthe charts\u201d aren\u2019t so interested in the past. Anything over 6 months old is considered old lol. Probably why I see many of the \u2018big\u2019 artists trying to make a few big hits trying to land other things\u2026\u2026 in television or hollywood where the real money is. Best music is the stuff made by folks who just do it for the music who post their work on bandcamp, youtube ect. Young virtuosos\u2026\u2026there isn\u2019t many outlets for them anymore with traditional music business. Plus you have to be young and hott to really have that appeal which is unfortunate (thanks MTV). But thankfully, what people can cook up in their bedroom studios is equivalent in quality to what the top acts used in the 60\u2019s and 70s to record music (actually better). So the quality of music you can get today from unknown acts in pretty amazing. For a music lover who doesn\u2019t need the charts at all its a wonderful time for pure music if you know where to look. They seem to do well to with their channels, getting enough clicks and subscribers to maybe pay off a few bills a year. No one is getting uber rich from it but they are making decent coin directly controlling their career. So much great music from unknown talent gets released daily. Go out of your way to find them. If you make music become your own manager and keep expectations realistic. Don\u2019t end up the new TLC. Try BIRP! Indie Playlists, New Music Blog, Music Videos, Latest News & More! ",
