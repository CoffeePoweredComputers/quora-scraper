            "answer_text": "Of course, women love many songs of many types, so \"most loved of all time\" is rather impossible to say. And of course, speaking for all the ladies is a total impossibility.  But I am one and I've talked to a few... often with a little music in the background, so I'll give it a shot. I'm going to spin it as \"songs that make ladies sigh and swoon or otherwise dissolve into a puddle\" to save me from listing all sorts of songs by Madonna and Helen Reddy and Aretha Franklin and Pink that we ladies love for various other reasons.  I'll start the list slow and as soulful as they come. Every note is perfect, pain and bliss all rolled into one:  \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" by Percy Sledge  This one got too much play for a looooong time, but I think it's fallen into its rightful place now and is a classic sigh-maker: \"I Will Always Love You\" by Whitney Houston (orig. by Dolly Parton); runner-up, C\u00e9line Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\"  Some might argue \"She's Got a Way\" or \"Just the Way You Are,\" but there has to be a Billy Joel song on this list and I think this is the right one: \"She's Always a Woman\" by Billy Joel  Bit of trivia: though this next song is best associated with a woman, Roberta Flack, it was actually written by a man, pining for the woman who was his lover and would later become his wife. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Time_Ever_I_Saw_Your_Face) A heartbreakingly powerful song that's probably on many ladies' lists of most-loved songs. \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" by Roberta Flack  There's a lovely comment on another version of this YouTube video that says it best: \"A man could ask for anything if he sang this song to a woman.......and\ufeff played the guitar like Eric Clapton!\" \"Wonderful Tonight\" by Eric Clapton; runner-up: Clapton's exquisitely tortured \"Layla\"  Here's the #1 guy who knew how to make the ladies swoon.... and one of his most swoonful songs ever. \"I Can't Help Falling in Love With You\" by Elvis Presley; runner-up, \"Love Me Tender\" ",
