            "answer_text": "I think Spotify also support Spotify Free for users to fully take a try. In the following we will compare Spotify with Apple Music. Cost Spotify operates under the freemium model (basic services are free, while additional features are offered via paid subscriptions). Spotify Premium need only $9.99/month, and new user has a 3 months for $0.99. Apple Music costs $9.99 monthly, with a $14.99 family plan option for up to six people. With the family plan, you'll need to set up iCloud Family Sharing, if you haven't already. New users has a 3 months free trial. How it works Spotify uses a cache on your computer's hard drive (as well as on the hard drives of all Spotify users). A cache is a temporary holding area for tracks you've listened to - if you want to listen to a track again, Spotify draws upon the music stored in your cache so that it doesn't have to re-download the track. When the cache is full, the old stuff gets overwritten. Apple Music works similarly to iTunes Match, the $25-per-year service which stores your music files in the cloud so you can stream them away from your computer. With iCloud Music Library, Apple scans all of the music you've purchased from iTunes or added to iTunes on your computer by ripping a CD, purchasing and downloading from another digital store or obtained from other means. With them, you can Spotify: Over 30 million tracks; thousands of curated playlists; Discover Weekly; Spotify Running; Radio; Chromecast, sound system, car, TV, and PlayStation integration; sharing and creating playlists with your friends. All of this is ready for you. Apple Music gives users access to the entire iTunes library, a swath of curated playlists, and a 24-hour radio station helmed by BBC-alum Zane Lowe. After you cancel the subscription: As a Spotify free user, you can enjoy your favorite albums and artists, with occasional ads. Apple Music: After you cancel an Apple Music subscription, you lose access to your iCloud Music Library along with any streaming songs you may have added, and redownloaded matched songs from your Mac's library. All of them are unable to work. You can manually add tunes to your devices' libraries again via iTunes or re-download your purchased content, but that's it. ",
