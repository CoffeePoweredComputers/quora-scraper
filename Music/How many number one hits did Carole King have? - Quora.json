            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say about 1,000. When she wasn\u2019t writing for herself, she was writing for others. Many of those girl groups of the early to mid 60s sang songs written by Carol, and her then husband, Gerry Goffin; Carol would later rearrange those songs and put them on her earlier albums. My own particular favourite is Up On the Roof. She remains one of my female icons from North America, the other\u2019s being Joni Mitchel and Carly Simon. All amazing women. Saw Carol in concert, in Dublin, in 1983. ",
