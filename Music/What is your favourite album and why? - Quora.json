            "answer_text": "The Dream Chapter Star- TXT: I like this album a lot, since I started following TXT before the debut, I expected a lot from the album. And I wasn\u2019t disappointed every song on it is a bop.Most people don\u2019t like their concept, or a song from it. But I love it, I thik the concept fits them for the time being. My favorite song(s) Cat and Dog, Crown. Our Summer.Crybaby and Dollhouse- Melanie Martinez: yes, I know she\u2019s been through some past controversy but I still love these albums. I can\u2019t choose a favorite song though.Blurryface, Vessel, and Regional at Best- Twenty One Pilots. I love these boys! These are some of my favorite albums from them, because some of my favorite songs are on it.",

            "answer_text": "At the moment? I like Confident (Demi Lovato). Firstly, Demi has managed to worm her way to pretty much 1st place of \u2018Imogen\u2019s Favourite Singers\u2019, so I tend to enjoy a lot of her music. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that I like every single song she makes, which is what makes Confident special. It\u2019s literally the only album I own where there are no songs I dislike. I do have preferences when it comes to the songs. I can tolerate the two remixes and Father isn\u2019t that bad, but given the choice I have songs which I rank above others. ",
