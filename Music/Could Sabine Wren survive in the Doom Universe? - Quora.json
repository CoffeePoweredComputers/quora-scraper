            "answer_text": "The mandalorian jedi from rebels? Ha no. She may be powerful against a lot of the things in SW due to her nature, but she isn\u2019t powerful enough to fight off endless legions of rampaging sentient tanks that can create shockwaves and tank through tungsten slug barrages that are powerful enough to rip through tanks. Even if she could face off against a few, there is an infinite number of demons as well as a number of different roles, like infantry (Possessed, possessed soldiers, imps, gargoyles), Support (Carcass, Summoners, Archvile) armored infantry (Hell knight, Barons of hell, Marauders), air support (cacodemon, lost soul, revanent, pain elemental), and anti personnel armor (arachnotron, mancubus, tyrants). And then you also have titans who could rival ancestrals, beings who tore up the land when fighting each other. Her jedi skills may allow her to survive a long time, but she has never shown the capability to fight off an army of gargoyles that could be spawned fast enough and large enough where an entire fleet of ships are destroyed. And if this was in hell, she would have instantly died. Why? Hell is not only an infnite dimension that devours planets, dimensions, and universes, it is also a reality warping plague. She would have been corrupted by hell the instant she entered. Either that, or she would have died from its toxicity, which only the forces of hell and the slayer could survive in. Plus, she doesn\u2019t have infinite stamina nor does she have the endurance of the slayer. ",
