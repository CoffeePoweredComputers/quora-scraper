            "answer_text": "Oh Bengalis and their romance. Can't say about the current generation, but our generation, which grew up with Neellohit and Neera, it is difficult to select one single romantic movie. Still, some definite candidates will be (in random order): Basanta Bilap - Soumitra-AparnaTin Bhuboner Pare - Soumitra-TanujaBalika Bodhu - Partha-MousumiHarano Sur - Uttam-SuchitraChaoya Paoya - Uttam-SuchitraI am sure I am forgetting some gems though. But to me (snd surely to many more) the best romantic movie will be the cult love story Saptapadi - Uttam-Suchitra.  The sublime Suchitra Sen as Reena Brown and all time best romantic Bengali hero Uttam Kumar as charming Krishnendu is forever etched un Bengali mind. Who can forget Suchitra's crisp retort \u201co amake touch korbe na\u201d or the iconic song \u201cei poth jodi na sesh hoy\u201d. The chemistry between the two was electric. Their hate and love, their joy and despair, their \u201cmilna-bichharna\u201d have swayed all including me. This movie (also many other old movies) proves that a beautiful love story can be romantic and endearing even with really bad makeup, painted props and lack of technology. The true love story takes you beyond these nitty-gritty and all you care about is whether the two loving souls lived happily ever after.  Saptapadi (1961 film) - Wikipedia ",

I like the following too : The Soumitra-Aparna Sen starrer SAMAPTI, which is a part of Satyajit Ray\u2019s TEEN KANYAThe Soumitra-Aparna Sen starrer BAKSHO BODOL, which was also a Satyajit Ray scripted movie.",
