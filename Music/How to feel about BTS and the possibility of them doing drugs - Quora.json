            "answer_text": "The possibility of them doing drugs? I am going to be honest here, what is the chance of them doing drugs? Are they taking any medication that can be addictive? Do they smoke? Do they drink? The only answer we all know for sure, is \u2018Do they drink?\u2019 And the answer is yes. Is it normal that they drink? Yes.  You can see in this chart, South Korea is the most country that has alcohol consumption in Asia. So drinking there is almost a habit. But is there any proof that BTS do drugs? No. But in my opinion people do drugs from hundreds of bad reasons, and one of them is a depressing life. (And more reasons of course\u2026) So is BTS leading a harsh bad depressing life? No. But I wonder what made this question come up to your mind too? I see no claim or rumor regarding drugs you know? Only smoking, one for V and one for Yoongi, but none were confirmed. ",
