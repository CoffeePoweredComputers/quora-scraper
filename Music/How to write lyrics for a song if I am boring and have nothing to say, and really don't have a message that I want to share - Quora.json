            "answer_text": "-Write about someone who is not you. You say you\u2019re boring. Okay, what would the not-boring version of you do? Today, maybe you got up and ate breakfast, then went to school, or work, or church. What would have happened if you did the opposite of that? If you slashed your ex-girlfriend\u2019s tires? If you walked away from your job? If you told your teacher that you\u2019ve always loved her? If you went out and got a dog, and lived the rest of your life as a vagabond, backpacking through the countryside? -Explode normal things into big things. Think of the best day you\u2019ve ever had. Or the worst day. Imagine the scene in which the pivotal moment occurred. What chair were you sitting in? Can you write a song about that chair? Was it cursed? Were you doomed to experience that terrible day because the person that made this chair was a serial killer who transferred his energy to it? -Pick an emotion or feeling and expand on it. Somewhere, sometime, someone made you angry. Why? What did they say or do? What did you say back? What do you wish you had said? -Keep a journal. It doesn\u2019t have to be thorough, or well-written. In fact, it\u2019s better if you just ramble. Every morning, wake up, write something down, then go about your day. In a week, go back and read the entries, and see if themes emerge. -When you have an idea (and you will), write it down, or record it. If you wake up at 3 in the morning with an idea, record it on your smartphone, or write it on a pad. Otherwise, you will forget it. The muse comes at random times. You have to be ready. \u2014\u2014- It sounds to me like you believe songwriting is all about confession or \u201cspeaking the truth.\u201d That\u2019s one approach. A good songwriter can write about things that never happened to them. They can create characters that do not exist. They can tell interesting stories by emphasizing the parts or elements that other people don\u2019t think of or pay attention to. You can still find the honesty in fiction. \u201cThe Godfather\u201d (the movie) is pure fiction, but it\u2019s based on very real truths about people, criminals, and families, etc. Great songs can do the same thing.

            "answer_text": "Sing about how you have nothing to sing about. Just start churning out songs. You don\u2019t have to like them. You don\u2019t even have to finish them. Just write them about anything that comes to mind, whether it\u2019s someone you saw at the post office who had a weird-looking face, a bird that you see in your backyard, a memory from your childhood. Like you said, you should write about stuff you know, stuff you\u2019re familiar with from your everyday life. Write about going on Quora for advice. Write about your favorite color. Not everything has to have a real heavy subject. Start off small\u2014really small\u2014and work your way up to deeper, more abstract feelings when it starts to feel natural. Write songs for you friends, for their birthdays or graduations or anniversaries. Write a song every week. Write a verse or a few notes every day. One of the best things you can do for yourself as a writer is to ignore the part of your brain that\u2019s trying to convince you that \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d is real. It doesn\u2019t have to be good, it can be something completely ridiculous and infantile at first like \u201cmy favorite color is blue/how about you, oh, how about you?\u201d Even if it\u2019s absolute crap and you never play it for anybody, just WRITE it!
