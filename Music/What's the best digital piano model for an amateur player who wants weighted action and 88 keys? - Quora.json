            "answer_text": "All things considered, I say the PX-5s Casio. You see them more and more with real gigging players. At 25 pounds, it is a new paradigm of plastic. I bought it because the action and the texture of the keys feels more like a piano than literally anything else available. I wanted something light weight. a 50 pound Kurzweil with case is heavy and doesn't fit in many cars. For reference, I sold pianos for a year for a store with hundreds. I played the 9 foot grands, the German makes. Yamaha, etc. And hundreds of old junkers. I played all the electric Yamahas (and accoustic) and I disagree with anyone who thinks Yamaha keyboards have the best action. I don't think anyone tries to say the have the best piano sounds. It actually can do more than people realize, with hexlayers. You can program your own sounds or buy them or share for free on Casio forum. For the cost, about $900 US, it is my first choice for a stage piano that I have to carry and setup. Hell, I can load any software synth or apps in my mini iPad, route it back into they PX-5s, and you realize\u2026 you just bought the best piano midi controller too. Why buy the one that sounds best when you can use any keyboard as a midi controller and sounds are cheap now. I also quickly realized, their piano sounds better than any of the others, imo. I have owned kurzweils, Rolands, korgs. ",
