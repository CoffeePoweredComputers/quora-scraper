            "answer_text": "Foo Fighters: Friend of A Friend It's on Disc 2 of Foo Fighters' 2005 album In Your Honor that the closest thing to 'a Kurt Cobain tribute' can be found. Friend of a Friend was an acoustic track penned by Grohl in 1990- just weeks after he'd moved to Seattle to join Nirvana. Written in Kurt's Olympia apartment on his acoustic guitar, the track describes Grohl's first impressions of the frontman and bassist Krist Novelselic... and paints a pretty bleak picture of the band's early days. The song captures the act of Grohl finding Cobain's guitar, with the lyrics: \"He plays an old guitar/With a coin found by the phone/It was his friends guitar/That he played\". It also hints at Kurt's early drinking habit, with the lines: \"He thinks he drinks too much/'Cause when he tells his two best friends/'I think I drink too much'/No-one speaks\". The song was first recorded in secret in 1990, before being released on Grohl's Pocketwatch cassette album under his Late! psuedonym two years later. Despite being recorded again for a BBC Evening session in 1997, it wasn't until the release of In Your Honour where it was revisited for the acoustic disc of the LP that Grohl was forced to open up about its origins. When quizzed about the track, Grohl told Q Magazine: \"I'd just moved in with Kurt. I didn't know anybody. I had a drum set packed in one box and flew up there. I would stay up till the sun came up and sleep all day. \"Olympia, Washington, is fucking depressing enough and I was living with this person that I didn't know. But he had a four-track so I wrote songs: Marigold and Friend Of A Friend. It was an observation of Kurt and Krist and I.\" Asked if he ever played the song to Kurt, he simply responded: \"No. I don't think I did. Probably not.\" Written years before Kurt's untimely death, and more of an \"observation,\" than a tribute, Friend of a Friend just happens to capture a moment in time, representing the early and uncertain days of Grohl joining the band.
