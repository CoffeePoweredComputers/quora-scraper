            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s destroying the artistry in singing any more than the artistry in singing already has been destroyed. It doesn\u2019t remove any of the humanity or emotion of singing as some people claim - in fact, you probably have heard tonnes of songs with autotune and never even realised it because nowadays it\u2018s that good. You can even get natural vibrato and fine tune the characteristics of a singer\u2019s voice on autotune these days. It\u2019s a common myth that autotune makes bad singers into good singers - not true. You still have to be able to sing well. Autotune isn\u2019t magic, it has limitations. The more off-pitch you are, the harder it will be to correct. Note, auto tune doesn't add \u2018life or humanity to the vocals either - the human still needs to add those things. Good signers won\u2019t need it but I can guarantee you that producers will add it anyway just to get the pitch \u2018just right\u2019. So, really it\u2019s not so much destroying the artistry of singing because you still need to be a good, emotional singer. It\u2019s something producers add to mixes to provide the small extra touch - like adding reverb and EQ to vocals. In fact, for far longer we have been adding reverb to vocals and adding EQ to change the sound of vocals which is basically the same principal. Many songs may not have even been recorded in the same take - sometimes producers just chop the best bits from each take and mash them all together - so they\u2019re not even the same full take. The artistry in singing/music was already destroyed along before auto-tune. I would it was destroyed roughly when businessmen got involved\u2026 On another note, auto tune can actually be a very interesting tool to use. When you use it unconventionally it can be a great tool to artistically process vocals and sounds. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer can be both yes, no, and both at the same time. Others have mentioned using it for special effect, but I\u2019d like to go at it from a different angle, where it\u2019s used to either capture or create the best possible rendition of the naturally occurring human expressions. As an example of natural vocal expressions, I\u2019ve always been especially moved and stirred by the vocal talents of Brian Wilson, of the Beach Boys. In romantic ballads, Brian used glissando (or glide), to create a deep sense of longing and yearning for romantic love to be fulfilled. Many of his note leaps were distinctly stepped, then just at the right moment, his glissando would kick in and set up a sense of anticipation as the upcoming target note in the upper register was delayed by the glissando. In the story, he was waiting for his love to be fulfilled. In the vocal delivery, he was waiting for the target note to be reached. Brilliantly subtle! As he\u2019d return back to the lower register on the next note, his glissando would then \u201cfloat\u201d back down to the resolve rather than simply stepping down to it. He brought the listener home with a soft landing. During my first few years of using Auto-Tune, I studied the graphic pitch analysis curves of some of the best singers I had in the studio. They always sounded on pitch, but the analysis curve showed that they were only on pitch 20-40% of the time. Everything else was their glissando\u2019s, which was among the most substantial of their expressive techniques. Various singers showed different rates of climb and shape on the analysis curve. The exact pitch of the final, target note destination was always met at exactly the right time, but often, only for a brief moment. As I began to experiment with duplicating those kinds of glides and shapes for the lesser singers, I found it very hard to accomplish. The expressive requirements of the glide shape varied, depending on the artistic intent of every single note change. For a highly dramatic peak, moving toward the highest note in the song, a great singer\u2019s pitch might rise fairly quickly, but then hold slightly flat for a split-second before nailing the target pitch at the peak. More relaxed dynamic sections would bring the pitch up more evenly in a more linear kind of pitch curve. Given enough time, interest and tedious manipulation, I did find that I could create very convincing renditions of great vocal expressions from singers who did not posses them. So, where does the artistry lie in this kind of situation? If the final outcome is the sole result of the vocalist, then that is their artistry. But if the final outcome is the result of inspired, painstaking manipulation by the recording engineer, is he not then the one who\u2019s creating the artistry? If the listener finds emotional value, is it not art either way? If the vocal sounds stunningly natural, soulful and expressive, but only as a result of 100 hours of manipulation, is this really overuse of Auto-Tune? Or, is it simply a different artistic goal, as opposed to the glitchy pitch effects commonly heard in contemporary music? Here\u2019s the take-away: Four decades ago I had a recording mentor who told me many things I wished were not true about recording. Yet, all of what he told me turned out to be true in the long run. One of those things was this: He said, \u201cBart, we are not in the business of capturing sound, exactly as it is, to be heard later, exactly as it was. We can\u2019t do that. We\u2019re in the business of creating the illusion of an event that represents a viable sense of what the client is doing.\u201d For a long time, I hated that philosophy. But I eventually learned that it was true. A skillfully executed oil painting of a scenic vista can be stirring and satisfying. But it is not the scenic vista itself. The aromas of the vegetation, the warmth of the sun, the feel of the wind, the sounds of nature, are not there. Yet, we can be warmed by the painting and inspired by the skills of its maker. It\u2019s much the same with recording. We use very expensive tools and employ techniques that are very hard to master in order to create an illusion. Absent those tools and techniques, the outcome is a muddled, foggy smear of sound that is totally honest and perfectly uninteresting. It\u2019s not just the band we\u2019re hearing on a recording. It\u2019s the result of a team who is working to highlight the band as the central theme. Ironically, the easiest thing to do in the studio is create special effects and the hardest thing to do is a recording that sounds as natural as possible. Based on the question, we\u2019re trying to make a distinction about who has made the contribution. It\u2019ll vary depending on what we expect as consumers, but will always be a little intangible. We weren\u2019t there when the recording was made, so we don\u2019t know what took place or who the hero really is. It may be best to just enjoy it for what it is, irrespective of how it got that way. ",

            "answer_text": "Blaming Auto-tune for removing the artistry from singing is like blaming tape editing or reverb or EQ. Artistry is about the use (or misuse) of the tools at hand, not the tools themselves. You can use Auto-tune to produce the boring, plastic sound of Disney radio, or you can crank it all the way up to maximize its otherworldliness and radical creative potential.  My favorite use of Auto-tune is finding melodies in rapped, spoken or loosely sung material. Hip-hop musicians like Kanye West and Lil Wayne lead the way here, as do Radiohead and the Gregory Brothers (the producers of the Auto-tune The News videos.) R&B artists like T-Pain use Auto-tune to give their melismas that science-fictional stairstepped quality. Singers in India and the Middle East are pushing the melismatic use of Auto-tune even further. In my own work, I've discovered a lot of cool effects by duplicating a vocal several times and applying different Auto-tune settings to each copy. Digital vocal processing is to the present what distortion and wah-wah on guitars was to the 60s and 70s. It can be used for lame, cliched sounds or radical new modes of expression. It's all in the application. As you might guess, I use a lot of Auto-tune in my own work, here's a sample:  http://soundcloud.com/ethanhein/warm-valley-remix ",

            "answer_text": "I think, that apart from the other positive technical possibilities of using Auto-Tune, one misuse of Auto-tune is, as the term says, to \u2018auto-tune\u2019 the vocals. It\u2019s because of auto-tune, that people who really can\u2019t sing with the proper vocal training and produce the required skill, use auto-tune to sound good. Auto-tune, has its own benefits technically. I\u2019m honestly yet to learn quite a lot about it as a proper concept. I just feel it shouldn\u2019t be used to improve a person\u2019s vocals. That\u2019s the individual\u2019s duty to train well and sound proper. According to your question, it doesn\u2019t really \u2018remove\u2019 the artistry in singing. Well, in a case where a person needs to sing a song, and can\u2019t get the pitches right, uses this concept to \u2018sound\u2019 perfect, that would be incorrect. He should train well to produce the right sound. The modern singers in India, use alot of Auto-tune. But when it comes to Hindustani Classical Music, auto-tune is never, I repeat, NEVER used. Hindustani Classical Music is by far the most respected form of music in India, and in fact extremely well known globally. The globally respected Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Rahul Deshpande, Vasantrao Deshpande, Mahesh Kale, Sonu Nigam, Shankar Mahadevan,Vishal Dadlani,Shekhar Ravjiani,Arijit Singh,etc. These singers are legendary, for a reason. They produce vocals, solely based on decades & decades of proper vocal training. I do know the meaning of the word \u2018Melisma\u2019. So with all due respect, I would have to disagree with Ethan Hein, with his opinion about Indian Singers making a very melismatic use of Auto-tune. Yes, some singers do. Only some, but not all. **FYI : The term \u2018Melisma\u2019, with respect to Hindustani Classical Music, refers to the \u2018Aakaar\u2019, succeeded by the more technical \u2018Sargam\u2019. A succession of multiple notes on a single word, which is practiced intensively by classical learners.Any singer who could perform one or multiple Sargams for any particular \u2018Raagaa\u2019, is an established and well nurtured singer, and not someone who has utilized auto-tune to sound good.(A \u2018Raagaa\u2019, is basically a collection of musical notes used in succession, mostly to improvise on an existing musical performance. Intensively used in Indian musical performances. Intensively.) Cheers & Namaste! ",

What we love about artists and singers from the past such as John Lennon, James Taylor, Rod Stewart, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, and Frank Sinatra are the humanity in their voices - they are not necessarily the most perfect when it comes to pitch and tonal quality, but there is a certain original element in their voices that will be missing when too much AutoTune or pitch correction software is used. Whether you like their singing voices or not, trying to pitch correct them to sound extremely perfect is basically missing the whole point of music in the first place - to express. ",

Some songs go for a more synthetic aesthetic, and autotune helps create that aesthetic, if that is what the artist is going for. You may not personally like autotune, but that does not make it objectively bad. If anything, it makes vocals more on pitch, which makes them \u201cobjectively better\u201d in a sense (though I\u2019m not making that argument, Autotune definitely doesn\u2019t mesh well with certain genres, and aesthetics). Sometimes autotune is used for bad vocals to hide behind, but that isn\u2019t always the case (or even usually the case). Autotune can absolutely be used artistically as well. A few songs that use it in a more \u201cartsy\u201d sense:  Fear Uncertainty Doubt by Holly Herndon  Hide and Seek by Imogen Heap (which doesn\u2019t technically use autotune, but it uses vocoder which often gets conflated with autotune, and gets many of the same criticisms).
