            "answer_text": "Dove shampoo increases dandruff! Dove conditioner increases hair fall soon after we apply. I was using Dove shampoo since the time it was launched here in Karnataka. I felt its really a mild shampoo and it made my hair less dry. Before using Dove shampoo I never had dandruff problem. Since the time I started using Dove shampoo I started to have lot of dandruff and I had never realized it was because of Dove shampoo! I always thought something is really wrong. And like I said I was happy with the mildness and less frizzyness in hair. Since few days I was using'Bear shampoo' and I had no dandruff! Since my shampoo got over at home and I had to use Dove Shampoo which was always there at home. Hmmm to my bad surprise I saw dandruff back in my scalp immediately!(just by using 2 times in 4 days gap). Only now I got to know why I always had dandruff problem. I felt its worth sharing. MAy be there are others who are facing same problem and not aware. Its may be because Dove shampoo is not suitable for my scalp type but yeah i'm really dis-appointed that the shampoo I loved brought this dandruff problem!. ",

May be,the smoother the hair,the thinner it looks.Dandruff - this is the major reason why I quit using few brand conditioners as well. Dandruff rather than it's annoying nature, also very dangerous when left untreated. So if u feel like getting dandruff because of any oil or shampoo that you use , please avoid it immediately.Try to choose sulphate free shampoos which is always good for long run of healthy hair! ",
