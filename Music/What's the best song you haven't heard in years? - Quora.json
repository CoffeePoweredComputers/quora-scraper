            "answer_text": "Just seeing this question made me think for a minute, \u201cWhat haven\u2019t I heard in years that I\u2019d like to right now?\u201d I was so accustomed to hearing certain songs all the time when I was much younger, but they\u2019re not Classic Rock or 80\u2019s music or dance music, or even huge Top 40 hits that may get played on this stationeries or that anymore since the formats of new radio and internet streaming services tend toward the biggies, the instantly familiar. So I took a look into my piles of older stuff and ended up in the 1970\u2019s. Since the radio was on all the time then, I heard tons of tunes, but after the 70\u2019s, many of those hits faded away. Let\u2019s see if I can resurrect a few for this answer. Lee Michaels: \u201cDo You Know What I Mean\u201d (from 5th, 1971)  Redbone: \u201cCome And Get Your Love\u201d (from Wovoka, 1973)  Wet Willie: \u201cKeep On Smilin\u2019\u201d (from Keep On Smilin\u2019, 1974)  Starbuck: \u201cMoonlight Feels Right\u201d (from Moonlight Feels Right, 1976)  Walter Egan: \u201cMagnet And Steel\u201d (from Not Shy, 1978)  Free Movement: \u201cI\u2019ve Found Someone Of My Own\u201d (from I\u2019ve Found Someone Of My Own, 1971)  Johnny Bristol: \u201cHang On In There, Baby\u201d (from Hang On In There, Baby, 1974)  Bloodstone: \u201cNatural High\u201d (from Natural High, 1973)  Raydio: \u201cYou Can\u2019t Change That\u201d (from Rock On, 1979)  The Blackbyrds: \u201cWalking In Rhythm\u201d (from Flying Start, 1974)  There\u2019s a quick list. I could\u2019ve been at this all day. Maybe you\u2019ll find one or two you like, too. ",
