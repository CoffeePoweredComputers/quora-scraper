            "answer_text": "I would say they definitely do.  A lot happens in mixing that defines the flavor and aesthetic of the track. Ideally, with experience, mixing is occurring simultaneously with production: in EDM production it is almost impossible to define where one ends and the other begins.  For example, I always need to mix the drum and bass elements as I lay them down to know if they're going to work in concert, and at that time I have to make some song-defining decisions in eqing priorities (i.e. who gets to dominate in the crucial low mids). Through this process of mixing issues are discovered with certain sounds, which then need to be replaced or worked out (for example, a bassline might need to be lowered an octave to stop it conflicting with a kick drum, or the kick drum might need to be replaced). Production and mixing are constant and overlapping. The truth is; a powerful way to approach production itself is through the lens of mixing. Ideally, the sounds and their sequencing should fall together in such a way that a \"mixing phase\" to clean it all up is largely unnecessary. If you're spending hours eqing a sound and manipulating its dynamics to let it play nice with the other sounds, it could mean that it was just a bad call using that sound in the first place. Being able to reverse or make new production decisions because of issues in the mix is precisely why it shouldn't be outsourced to someone else.  ",

Other times it\u2019s just to have access to another perspective or the sound you can get from the very best equipment. ",

Most of the EDM composers do mix their songs, though I am sure that there are some who don't. If you are able to mix a song for an hour and half good for you, this is good timing. However, for most EDM composers the process of arrangement and mixing comes together, they mix the song while they produce. This is how I do my self, wether it is an EDM track or no. ",
