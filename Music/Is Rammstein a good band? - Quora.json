            "answer_text": "2If you understand German, great listen to Rammstein on YouTube. If you don't understand German watch the live performance on YouTube and download some lyrics translation if you want to know what the song is about. Keep in my mind that many of their songs are not for the soft hearted. But they always lyrics about true or real events that happened in the past, present and future. Good Example: \u201cMEIN TEIL\u201d translates to: \u201cMY PART\u201d meaning actually \u201cMy Genital Part\" that he and his new lover (off whom the bodypart is from) and are cooking it for dinner and then the chorus singing: \u201cthis is my part\u2026-NO, it's my part. Rammstein have lots of sick content in the lyrics but if they didn't write and sing about it, no normal public young and old people would know about some of these sick people who live among us. On the other hand Rammstein are using lots humor to ridicule the sickness in such a case. Check the link below if you want to know more about the Rothenburg cannibal Armin Meiwes.

            "answer_text": "Good is so simple. You can say \u2018Great\u2019. Why ?Because Rammstein songs are almost all are in German language. But their fans are not all German and neither do they all understand German. But Rammstein has a huge number of fan though. They have created a spot in the audiences mind through the tone and the bit and most of all their pyrotechnics. Their songs are so catchy and even though you don\u2019t understand them at all they will draw you with the metallic vibe.  Their stage performance itself is a display of art.  and craziness.   and a little something more.  where else would you find any band performing a flame thrower mounted on their face?  ",
