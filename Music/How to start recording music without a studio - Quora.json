            "answer_text": "If you are a creative, productive musical person and you have a body of work you intend to record there are many affordable options open to you these days. For the price of \u2018Free\u2019 you have several options in the DAW department. Digital Audio Workstation, this is what \u2018DAW\u2019 refers to. We are talking about software here. Depending on your home computer, either Windows, or Mac, or one of the Linux releases you can begin putting together a functional, high quality recording set up using one of the DAW options, together with some good quality hardware. For a basic, useful recording configuration you need: Your computer, either laptop, or desktop is best, you need the grunt of at least 8GB of RAM, preferably 16GB. Your DAW of choiceCondenser microphone/dynamic microphoneVST pluginsAudio InterfacePro Tools, Tracktion, Audacity, are 3 digital recording platforms which are totally free, and full featured. Pro-Tools entry version Tracktion Version 6 Reaper I suggest either of these three DAW options, you will have to have a look and determine which one appeals to your situation. Audio Interface - this is the outboard piece of hardware which interfaces between your instruments, and microphones, and the computer. Your DAW connects to your music through this. Behringer | Product | UMC202HD This model offers two inputs, which is ample for home recording, where you can build each production track by track; with the 2 inputs you have the key to production, each input is capable of taking either XLR/quarter inch connections. Behringer offer some excellent choices, I personally use their 2 channel U-Phoria UMC202 HD and this works very well. You can purchase everything you need from Amazon, or eBay. This audio interface retails between $60 -$180 it provides \u2018phantom power\u2019 for any condenser microphone, plus it has pre-amps which produce surprisingly good quality outcomes. You can see where this is heading. Through investing in some modest equipment you can be in the position of recording your music to a high standard. The big problem with this type of recording is the drop in sound quality from your recording \u2018master\u2019 and the MP3, or WAV file you need to render. We overcome this drop in sound quality by the process of \u2018Mastering\u2019. Abbey Road studio in London England provide online mastering services, very affordable, superb quality. Abbey Road Mastering services End-to-end recording from your own recording set up. If you were planning on hiring the services of a professional recording studio you must have some funds earmarked for same; you can invest this expense in your own production and be in the position to produce your own music. However you can master your own recordings with widely available plugins and utilities, the objective here is make the whole project louder and very clear so that it stands out when played back, and can handle multiple copying. Combine all of this independent fire power with the enormous reach of social media, internet based promotions and you could conceivably totally bypass the music industry and become an independent musical personality. I am not making any extravagant claims for \u2018success\u2019 here, that is another matter. But for the practical solution of being your own music production factory, this is very possible, very affordable and completely realistic, the rest is up to you. I sometimes encounter musicians who \u2018roll their eyes\u2019 at the mention of Social Media, and using digital media to promote their work - these people think that \u2018spamming\u2019 your music to all and sundry is what is being suggested; NO. The use of internet resources for marketing involves that you must additionally go on a journey of discovery, leave behind your assumption, your prejudice and actually engage with some learning. It might be a new idea for you, I don\u2019t know, but this resistance to seeing that the internet is our global middleman and that over 4 billion people use it each day puzzles me. Of course we need to be somewhat more discerning than to simply spam our music. Building an audience locally is often a great idea, and if we look at this local audience we can see that your music occupies a position on the music \u2018spectrum\u2019, your genre, or \u2018micro-genre\u2019. If you can identify what genre your music matches, this is your key to reaching very specific people. As I mentioned, this is not an easy process, and this is why succeeding with music is not \u2018easy\u2019; it takes thought, work, and very strong intentions. I personally know a couple of fellow music people who are succeeding with building their own audiences, and promoting their self recorded work to the world. I am also involved with looking at this and my journey has begun. As a more \u2018mature\u2019 guitar player I am returning to playing and honing my chops, and writing some more songs, I am documenting this journey, and you should too. The conclusion of this little rave is that we have very high quality tools and resources available to us these days, we can produce equally high quality music which others can access easily, and enjoy. for a few hundreds of dollars/pounds/euros, or whatever we can become independent music producers, many people are already doing this successfully; I am not claiming success is easy, but music production from the home studio is a real option.
