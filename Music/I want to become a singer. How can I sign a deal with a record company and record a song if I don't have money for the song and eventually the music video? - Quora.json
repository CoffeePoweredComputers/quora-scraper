            "answer_text": "Don't waste your time trying to sign a deal.  That is not the quickest, most profitable nor most liberating way to become a singer.  I followed this exact process and got around 1,000 followers in 12 months while only spending 5-10 hours per week on it.  Here's what you need to do: First, why do you want to be a singer? Money, fame, artistic expression, etc.? You need to decide why and base your direction on the \"why.\"Buy a nice, but inexpensive USB microphone.  I recommend the Blue Yeti[1].  It is currently on sale in several places for less than $150.Create a SoundCloud account and start searching for instrumentals which inspire you.  There are tons of high-quality options from great artists who are underground and obscure.  When you find one you like, reach out to the artist via the SoundCloud private messenger and ask them if you can get a download of their track so you can add vocals to it for a remix.  This is called \"ego bait.\"  You are stroking the artists ego by asking them for their track and more often than not, they will comply and give you the file.  If it available for free download, don't even ask.  Just get the file.Buy or download a nice, but inexpensive multi-track software[2]. Many of them have free \"lite\" versions.  You only will need 4-6 tracks at the absolute most, so basically anything will work.Watch tutorials on the how the software works, then:Upload your free downloaded track from SoundcloudLet the track play over & over while you write your lyricsRecord your lyrics and test different notes to sing until you get what you likeAdd multiple layers of your voice for depth in accents or chorusesSave your first demo :)Upload the track to SoundCloudTell the artist who you borrowed the instrumental from that your track is up on your page.  If they like it, they will drive traffic to the page for you and share your song on their SoundCloud profile.Go \"like\" about 100 people's pages who make music like yours.  They will likely return the favor and at least listen to your track.  Repeat steps 1-6, find more songs and build up your inventory of tracks!You don't need to be signed to be a singer/songwriter.  Being signed is a good way to limit yourself and go into debt, in my humble opinion. I hope this helps! Footnotes[1] Google[2] Google",

            "answer_text": "My advice is take one step at a time. So presuming you are starting out from scratch with no budget there are several things you can do to get started. 1) Look for collaborators Use the internet to your advantage. Go on forums through sites such as Reddit or Gumtree and look for producers who are looking for singers. Many producers look for singers to collaborate with and write songs together\u2026therefore you would not need any money to do this. If you find a producer who is relatively new in the game they would be willing to work for free if you split the songwriting credits on the songs you write together. By working with a producer you should be able to record a demo of your song that should hopefully be to a good enough standard. 2) Focus on the music Forget about making a music video and focus more on the music. You should only start thinking about music videos when you already have a few songs recorded. Get your sound perfected. There is no point on having a music video when your song sucks! 3) Use social media Once you have your songs recorded, get on all the social medias and promote yourself. Try and make friends within the community to build up a rapport between your peers. The more people that know about your music the better. You have to work equally as hard at promoting yourself as you do on the music. You can\u2019t expect to put your song on the internet and for people to magically hear it. Promoting yourself through actively engaging with people on social media is free so there is no excuse not to do it. 4) Email industry people Once you feel your music is ready you should email as many relevant people in the industry as possible. A little research online and you can find the emails of managers, a&r\u2019s, publishers, record label executives etc etc. Keep your email precise and to the point and have a link to your music (with no more than 4 songs) early in the email. Whatever you do do not email a whole bunch of different a&r\u2019s in the one email through cc. Send each email separately and try and personalise it so the a&r feels like you are a fan of their work. They will appreciate it. In conclusion, it is definitely possible to get yourself started in the music industry even with no money. It just requires a lot of hard work, determination and hustle. ",
