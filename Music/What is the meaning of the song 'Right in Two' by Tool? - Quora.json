            "answer_text": "Right in two is a line from the Bible: 1 Kings 3 16-28. King Solomon, the wisest man to ever live is holding court. He is hearing a case about a child that is claimed by two prostitutes. They each tell Solomon that the other's child died in the night, and the child was stolen. Solomon calls for a sword and orders that the child be cut in two, and half be given to each woman. The real mother immediately gives up her claim, willing to give up her child rather than see it killed. The lying woman says it is a fair settlement. Solomon knows which is which and gives the child back to his real mother. We \"silly monkeys\" are like the lying woman, fighting to the bitter end, willing to divide things in two and destroy everything in the process. The song is about human nature and our constant eagerness to fight over everything in spite of our supposed intelligence. 16 Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. 17 One of them said, \u201cPardon me, my lord. This woman and I live in the same house, and I had a baby while she was there with me. 18 The third day after my child was born, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one in the house but the two of us. 19 \u201cDuring the night this woman\u2019s son died because she lay on him. 20 So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I your servant was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast. 21 The next morning, I got up to nurse my son\u2014and he was dead! But when I looked at him closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn\u2019t the son I had borne.\u201d 22 The other woman said, \u201cNo! The living one is my son; the dead one is yours.\u201d But the first one insisted, \u201cNo! The dead one is yours; the living one is mine.\u201d And so they argued before the king. 23 The king said, \u201cThis one says, \u2018My son is alive and your son is dead,\u2019 while that one says, \u2018No! Your son is dead and mine is alive.\u2019\u201d 24 Then the king said, \u201cBring me a sword.\u201d So they brought a sword for the king. 25 He then gave an order: \u201cCut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.\u201d 26 The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for her son and said to the king, \u201cPlease, my lord, give her the living baby! Don\u2019t kill him!\u201d But the other said, \u201cNeither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!\u201d 27 Then the king gave his ruling: \u201cGive the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother.\u201d 28 When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.
