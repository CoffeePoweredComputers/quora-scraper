While the students are watching the videos, EDpuzzle can collect data on how many times they are watching each section, whether they are really understanding the content and the answering situations to the questions so as to guarantee the learning and teaching effects. Edpuzzle interactive videos can be made with videos found from a number of websites such as YouTube, TED, Vimeo, Khan Academy, Learn Zillion, National Geographic, etc, reused from other teachers\u2019 video lessons or created and uploaded by teachers themselves. Edpuzzle creates the opportunity for the teacher to form a flipped classroom in which each student is assigned with interactive video lessons to watch at home to do the self-paced learning and join for doing more creative and meaningful activities and projects during the class time. Each video can be edited to create a lesson. Teachers can crop the video and use only what they need for their lesson. They can remove or shorten the video to be an appropriate length for the lesson they are teaching. You can't merge parts of a video together, nor can you combine different videos.   Click \u201cAdd cut\u201d to splice the video into clips.  In summary, EDpuzzle is a good assistant for teachers to teach.
