            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really know much about the recent girl groups so I won\u2019t make a comment on that. What I DO know is that Treasure seems to be really hyped up to be the Rookie of the Year for k-pop boy groups because it is the first boy group YG has debuted since iKon in 2015. It\u2019s been 5 whole years since YG has debuted a group. Being part of the Big 3 and having a reputation for having really good k-pop groups in general, Treasure has caught many people\u2019s attention. In addition, the show that they were made in, namely YG treasure box, aired in 2018, and those who have been following Treasure since have been steadily growing their fanbase. They seem to be very popular, with their Instagram account (currently) having 1.6 million followers, particularly impressive for an undebuted group. In addition, along with another group(which I will get to later), they are the only k-pop male artists whose songs have charted in genie music while being Undebuted, which is a very noteworthy achievement. They also have highly-talented members and attractive-looking members. For the first time, YG really decided to care more about visuals in a Boy Group, because he cared more about uniqueness with his previous boy groups such as iKon and Big Bang. They are very promising in terms of being a success. Their recently revealed concept has also caught attention for it\u2019s uniqueness. Many already speculate they may be the next big boy group. So overall, Treasure is a likely candidate for ROTY for K-pop boy groups. Another noteworthy group to mention that may take ROTY is the unnamed group that will debut from the currently ongoing survival show called \u2018I-Land\u2019. Having watched both YG treasure box and I-land(so far), I can make more-or-less fair comparisons between them. Anyways, back to the question. I-land still has a fair chance for making it as ROTY despite not being under the Big 3 and being comparatively newer. Here are some advantages they have over YG\u2019s Treasure. The show is STILL ongoing, which means that it still has more time time to build a steady fanbase.I-Land\u2019s fanbase is very International. In the last Global Voting,174 countries around the Globe Participated.While I-Land\u2019s fan base isn\u2019t as big as Treasure\u2019s yet, they already have a very dedicated fanbase in Twitter most notably. Not so much in Instagram though. However, they also have a dedicated fanbase in Youtube, with multiple youtubers posting I-land content everyday(or hour, literally). Many of their videos have already reached more than a million views.They also have more content than Treasure. While Treasure does have a couple of videos in Youtube with one reaching 25 million, the view count in total for all I-Land videos will still surpass I-land from the sheer content you get. (correct me if I am wrong about the views, but I can assure you, the number of videos from I-land will shock you, they have many performances and moments they post as videos, and have fancams for each individual member in I-land for every performance)As I mentioned earlier, the fan base is very dedicated. I-land now has not 1 but 2 original songs that have charted on Genie Music. Their latest song I&credible has been trending on Spotify in multiple countries and has already reached 115th place in the Wordwide I tunes chart (so far, and the song only released 3 days ago I believe). This is partially due to the dedicated fanbase who have repeatedly called upon people to stream the songs lol. I haven\u2019t seen any undebuted group besides Treasure to achieve something like this.Their potential debut members are also multinational, which is an advantage compared to Treasure with only Japanese and Korean members(which is already quite multinational in itself). The current Top 6 members of I-land(and are very likely to debut) are Australian, Korean, Japanese and Korean-American, and at least 3 of them are multilingual.While some of the I-land contestants definitely have less training than many of the Treasure members, they have monstrous potential. You can check their massive improvement in the span of weeks if you watch a few of their performances.Finally we can\u2019t forget I-land\u2019s visuals. Every person in the current top 6 are visuals, they have potential to be one of those no-visual hole in a group, with every member appealing to a different part of the globe. It is very obvious if you check Twitter with many accounts from different countries supporting this particular member more than the other.Anyways, both groups are very talented and I see those 2 boy groups to have the greatest chance of making it to ROTY. For now, it is safe assume that Treasure will get it because they are from the Big 3 and they\u2019ve been hyped up for over a year now, but you never know, the debuting group from I-land might catch y\u2019all by surprise. Hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, I\u2019ve got a few ones that are high up there for me who will probably get nominated. (sorry GG\u2019s only since I am not knowledgeable enough about BG\u2019s) Nomination 1: Purple K!SS (RBW Entertainment)  Why: Coming from a well-established company with artists such as ONEUS, MAMAMOO, and ONEWE just to name a few, PURPLE K!SS is set for stardom and THEY HAVEN\u2019T EVEN DEBUTED YET. They have just released their \u201cTeasers\u201d which are high-quality solo short songs that represent a genre of movies (Kinda like LOONA). Overall from the factors of the pre-debut activity, the agency and casting it would be in poor taste to not at least nominate them. Nomination 2: WEEEKLY  Why: The long-awaited sister group to APINK hit it out of the park with their debut, with it probably being the most refreshing of the year since they were surrounded by teen and girl crush. With the help of fantastic casting, song, choreo and, the buzz around them pre-debut (Due to Zoa\u2019s visual and their covers) they came with a bang and made their mark on the industry filling the void PRISTIN and FROMIS_9 left. Nomination 3: Secret Number  Why: Secret Number is probably the biggest success story of the year coming from a tiny company whose senior group flopped and disbanded :(, but they had many high profile trainees with Dita (Pre-debut Z-GIRLS member and 1 million dance studio), Denise (YG trainee), Jinny (YG and Pd48), Soodam (ulzzang) and L\u00e9a (mix9 and SKarf) SECRET NUMBER skyrocketed to the top gaining almost 25 million views on their debut song. That's amazing for a small company. Nomination 4: Cignature  Why: Being CIX\u2019s sister group all eyes were on them and we all had high expectations for them and boy did they exceed our expectations with Nun Nu Nan Na which had an interesting blend of concepts that sounded like a mix Between Twice. Red Velvet and Blackpink, the next comeback was ASSA which did even better and being praised possibly even more than Nun Nu Nan Na. Overall Cignature had one of the best debuts and follow-ups which had a fresh new flavor that we needed in the midst of badass and cute concepts left and right. Nomination 5: LUNARSOLAR  Why: LUNARSOLAR is probably the debut I\u2019m most excited for since I absolutely love space themes, I think a mixture of their concept, visual and amazing dancing skills will definitely attract fans. Overall JPLANET is a rich company so they will definitely give great promotions to this fledgling group with its prosperous future. Nomination 6: HOWZ  Why: This one is my wildcard but I think HOW has loaded this group with fresh and new talent have you seen their covers and visuals with an extremely popular pd48 trainee Wang Ke will definitely give this group the extra boost into monster rookie territory. like JPLANET HOW Ent. is rich and can give these guys some amazing promotions and songs they could be another Oh My Girl. Even though HOWZ isn\u2019t hyped up as much as WEEEKLY these girls can pack a punch and will definitely dominate after a while. ",
