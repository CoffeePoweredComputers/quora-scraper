            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always worked on the basis that it starts with a small \u2018knock\u2019 then when you think you have ridden that out, something else comes along. It\u2019s one set back after another. ou start to feel as if you are out of synch with the Universe and that God has it in for you. Whatever you do, it is or goes, wrong. You cannot do right for doing wrong. I\u2019ve found that about every ten years I get a period like this. My worst lasted a good few years the shortest about 3 months. For perspective, over the last 6 years I have had about 5 heart attacks, yet I don\u2019t consider that as a downward spiral because everything else has been pretty much ok. As such that means that within the next four years I expect I will hit a downward spiral. Before I start to feel out of synch with the universe I will try and get back in synch.Jump the gun, so to speak. I will look at my lifestyle and see what would be beneficial to change. Examples being, do I go out regularly drinking? I don\u2019t but if I did(and I did) I would change that. Have I done anything \u2018nice\u2019 or charitable lately? If not, I would correct that(Again, done previously). I\u2019m a great believer in Karma and what goes around comes around. The big question is, does it work? I would say yes. Hunker down, look at the changes you can make and remember, it will stop eventually, just sooner if you help it along and if you need help to do that, ask for it. ",

            "answer_text": "In life a person must create a spiral in each aspect of themselves in some direction, but at some age the physical spiral does turn downward if you think life is tossing you upwards at birth. I think what you are most likely referring to is the image you held for the way the world or yourself was supposed to be, and how the more you compare it becomes obvious that your model will crumble. If im right or not, this is an opportunity to start getting used to that happening, and I do that as often as I can it gets harder because you will get better at building the models to account for more factors. I was able to recognize patterns of information and my own behavior that I'm not sure how long it may have taken otherwise. The overall answer is your bigly doubly lucky because the answer may be yes, but for one there is not a bottom so no worries. Two, it's not a it's a lot of spirals growing as you do cyclical behavior through time, some will be going downwards but hopefully you can ride an upward bound one if you can find the right behavior or mentality. Who knows somebody's will have to go to the core of the heart of all hearts. My favorite biblical anything may not be in the bible, but King David was referred to as\u201d a man after God's own Heart\". ",
