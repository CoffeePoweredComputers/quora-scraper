You need to look at it from the other direction\u2026 No human is born with a religion and a god belief. \u201cAtheist\u201d is thus just a pointless word for the normal default state of a human mind.Tolerance is typically of a belief or dogma - not the absence of one. Atheism has neither tenets or dogma and makes no assertions.If any theist group or individual views the atheist\u2019s position is about being tolerated, clearly that is an obscenity since it illustrates that the religion thinks it can demand:belief in its claims (a nonsense as nobody can order someone to believe what they do not).compliance with its theocratic orders as a self elected authority. The Nazis had a similar way of thinking about people who did not agree with them.,Flip it - The least tolerant societies to theists are other theist societies with a different god or religion - not secular societies.The most intolerant nations with far worse UNESCO \u201csocial health\u201d (basically a happiness/education/civility) rating are the most religious nations. The highest scorers are the Nordic nations which are also the most secular nations. So unlike say being of the \u201cwrong\u201d religion in the Middle East or America, these secular, i.e. atheist nations are the most tolerant of those of different opinions, be that a religiosity or absence of one.",

Or, to put it simply, the same ones that are tolerant of NORMAL people. The ones which do not tolerate atheists are those with poor education, mass brainwashing by over-conservative politics influenced by religions, or worst of all, those RULED by religious wack-nut-jobs and their crazy theories, myths, superstitions and legends out of old books.
