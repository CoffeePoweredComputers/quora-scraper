            "answer_text": "It\u2019s really a matter of perception. Everyone likes different types of guitars. I like ESPs in general because I feel they have a better overall sound and playability than Ibanez. I\u2019m not a big fan of Ibanez necks and bodies. EPSs are sturdier and sound fuller in my opinion. Pickups are a major factor choosing guitars too. It\u2019s really a matter of choice. IMO ESP >>>>>>>>> Ibanez. ",
