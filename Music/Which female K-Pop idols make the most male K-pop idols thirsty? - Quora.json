            "answer_text": "If u mean thirsty as in thirty like \ud83d\udc40 ayeeee. Or can cause idols to stare at her and react\u2026 Than ima say hwasa.    Hwasa is a vocalist and subrapper from the talented vocal queen, visually beautiful and total crackhead and weird girl group, queens MAMAMOO. Hwasa is known for her killer vocals and natural stage presence. Whether she is walking, standing or dancing, hwasa definitely knows how to capture an audience. She is a fan favorite. She is also known for her curves and strong facial expressions. Her visuals dont exactly fit the koreans standard but many videos show koreans have voting her ,along with chungha and hyuna as the sexiest among idols. In her performances she is known for making both female and male idols flustered or interested. V of bts can be seen Ooooing at her.  Jimin also can be seen appreciating her performance with a sly smile.  Loco is a special man though. He has openly said hwasa was his ideal type. He is ALWAYS seen getting flustered by her. She often teases him too and he is honestly the sweetest to her. Tbh his respect and attraction towards her is the sweetest thing ever. Im not gonna lie\u2026..if they ever come out dating, I would make be so supportive of their relationship. I'm not into ships but they are two ppl I see getting together. He honestly is really sweet to her and hwasa is a woman who deserves to be more than gawked at. He constantly praises her and can be seen getting so nervous. He got awkward even talking on the phone with her and she can also be seen smiling and enjoying herself with him too. Thanks for letting me rant about how cute they are. But yeah loco is a rapper who gets HIGHLY flustered at her.      ",
