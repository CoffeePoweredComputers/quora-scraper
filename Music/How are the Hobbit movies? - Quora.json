            "answer_text": "Here is my take on the Hobbit film Trilogy. I do enjoy the films but, overall I prefer the Lord of the Rings films. I\u2019ll go over my pros and cons. Pros. Unlike the LOTR films PJ pretty much told the complete Hobbit story (duh the book is short enough and he made 3 films) and also showed us a bunch of stuff from the appendages and extra materials. Once again they made good use of film locations and also showed us more of Middle Earth (Mirkwood was especially enjoyable to see). The actors/actresses were great choices. Now for the Cons With all the time they had they made a lot of non canon mistakes: Azog was killed and Bolg led the army, Bard the Bowman was a captain of the guard not some town activist, the Thrush told Bard where to hit Smaug, the Dwarves being captured by the woodelves, the battle of 5 armies was completely different (each side sat down and prepared before the orcs came), and there are many other mistakes that were made. One of my favorite scenes is the white council at Dol Guldur but, unfortunately Galadriel and Elrond would not have been there because in the Unfinished Tales it tells of Gandalf TELLING Elrond of the wizards kicking out the necromancer. Thranduil was definitely not such a dick in the book. He came to help the people at lake town after Smaug destroyed it. Bilbo is said to have preferred to hang out with him and the elves during the battle of 5 armies! Legolas was not in the book\u2026okay I understand when Tolkien wrote the book he hadn\u2019t created Legolas yet but, he should have played a lesser role in the film. The PJ created character Tauriel was also not in the book and here is my thing\u2026I don\u2019t mind her character or a female warrior in the story but, the love shit between her and the dwarve was fucking dumb. If I wrote the damn thing for the movie I would have used her character in a different way. I would have had her push for the elves to take action and not be isolationists (due to Thranduil\u2019s experiences during the War of the Last Alliance in which his father died). I think that would have made her character stronger and made a bigger impact on the film. MOST of all my biggest complaint about the Hobbit films I didn\u2019t even realize at first. I realized it when I did a marathon of the Extended Hobbits and Extended LOTR films and it is the combat tone of the film. Let me explain\u2026In the LOTR films characters are fearful and fight for their lives! During the Battle at Helms deep the heroes are afraid and the enemy formidable. There is courage, bravery, and sacrifice. The vibe I got from the Hobbit films was a tone of humor and over the top shit. The Barrel riding scene is my least favorite because of how fucking ridiculous it is. Out of all the elf groups in Middle Earth (besides the possible Avari in the far east) the woodland elves in Mirkwood are the worst combat wise yet are seen as Rambos and Rambets. Fuck that noise\u2026when you watch Helm\u2019s Deep and see the elves (Yes I know the Lorien elves weren\u2019t supposed to be there and were busy being besieged by Dol Guldur) they fight and die realistically and it has deep meaning whereas the Mirkwood elves in the Hobbit Films are over the top and seem unkillable. That is my 2 cents. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d like to make it clear first that I\u2019ve only watched the first film in the series. Watching the first film was enough to make me realise that I had no interest in watching the rest. I had long suspected that too, ever since I found out they were making The Hobbit into three films. There simply isn\u2019t enough content. Books are inherently not a condensed format. Even a short book like The Hobbit can be made into three boring films but you\u2019re not supposed to go ahead and do it. It\u2019s like making Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them into five films. I watched the first and it immediately struck as an empty money spinner. That\u2019s what the first Hobbit film felt like: an empty money spinner. Is it at least entertaining, then? Nope, pretty much nothing happens in the almost three hours long film. It\u2019s not honest filmmaking, it\u2019s the typical Hollywood affair. They even created a new character called Tauriel that\u2019s nowhere in the books. So, not faithful to the source material either. Tauriel doesn\u2019t feel like she belongs in Tolkien\u2019s imagination; she just doesn\u2019t feel like his creation. There\u2019s literally nothing in the film that makes me say anything good about it. You don\u2019t praise animation unless the primary stuff in the checklist gets ticked. What\u2019s worse is it\u2019s a children\u2019s book. It\u2019s even written that way, different from the writing style of LotR, not meant for the same audience as LotR. It\u2019s only essential if you want to read beyond the LotR arc (The Silmarillion et al.). They made an inessential part of the LotR story arc into money spinners and people fell for it. Cheers to brainless entertainment junkies and the wonders of animation! ",
