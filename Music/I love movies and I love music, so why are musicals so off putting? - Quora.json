            "answer_text": "It\u2019s unlikely that you love all movies and all music, so it becomes a question about your personal tastes, which we would only be guessing at.

At the very least, go see Come From Away at your earliest convenience. I\u2019ve yet to meet someone who didn\u2019t appreciate it. ",
