            "answer_text": "Wow - some eye and ear opening content here. I thought my entries of 18:44 and 31 minutes were good, but perhaps based on the vinyl era, they are worth an honorable mention because the artists was trying to record and release the logest possible version of Sing Joy. My father, Buzzy Linhart has been performing a song he co-wrote (with Donna Calas) called \u201cSing Joy\u201d since the mid-late-60s. This is a raga-rock jam that can really go on and on \u2014 and they used to jam it for hours, often going into other songs but bringing it back to Sing Joy (similar to the Dead). He recorded a few versions, his longest studio recording being 18:44 minutes because that was the limit for 1 side of 33 RPM LP vinyl. His backing band for that version was the Welsh prog-rock group, \u201cEyes of Blue\u201d on this Phillips (1969) release. Their members went on to be in \u201cMan\u201d and have recorded their own verison of the Buzzy Linhart original \u201cTalk About a Morning.\u201d Anyway this London recording from 1968 begins with a nice long drone with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and later Big Jim Sullivan come sin on sitar, and Buzzy plays acoustic guitar using one of his alternate tunings, likely \u201cB Mountain Modal\u201d, but should confirm with him.  His longest live version was 31 minutes and the only track on the only official release from his band The Seventh Sons. ESP Disks released it in 1968 titled RAGA or 4 AM at Franks at about 31 minutes split into a side A and side B, but the original tape was longer. Buzzy says that at the time, squeezing more than 16 minutes per side reduced the fidelity. As others have pointed out, there is less limits with digital formats today. Here is a digitally re-joined and re-mastered version of 31 minutes of \u201cSing Joy\u201d: 4 AM at Frank's Restored Raga (mono, 1964/2001), by Seventh Sons However, perhaps the most satisfying version is only 8:22, but demonstrates his raga-rock-jazz-jam fusion. this verison begins with him on vibraphone, and session included Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter on guitar, Danny Trifan on bass, Peter Ponzol on electric wind instrument, Luther Rix on drums -all mixed by Todd Rundgren:  ",
