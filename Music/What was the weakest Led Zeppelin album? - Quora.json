            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say Coda. They put it out therefore it counts. In Through the Out Door more about John Paul Jones keyboards and contributions than Pages guitar dominance. From what I\u2019ve read Jones was right on the cutting edge of what was the explosion of synths. You don\u2019t hear him getting credit like Stevie Wonder or whatever but I\u2019ve read that he was right up there Stevie Wonder and Herbie Hancock with networking keyboards and pushing the boundaries of technology in a world where MIDI had not been invented. Led Zeppelin was not all about Page and ITTOD was Jones album to shine. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weak as much as it\u2019s just not as guitar laden as prior albums. And the keys are providing that density. Presence has one of my all time favorite Page songs on it. And there\u2019s a couple of shining moments. By all accounts the band was really struggling during recording. Plants injury. Tax exile. The death of Plants son. And they also simply ran out of studio time. I feel it was put out not quite done. None of the songs are horrible. It was just a dark time for the band and it showed. Its hard to look at Achilles and say Page was off when even he\u2019s said that\u2019s probably one of his best solos. Add in 11 to seven distinct guitar parts and the tempo and it\u2019s really hard to say he was off his game. Various albums have been remastered. It would be interesting to hand over the raw tracks of Presence to someone like Eddie Kramer and see what a entirely new mix might do. And that\u2019s a part of Presences problem. The actual mix is relatively flat and lifeless. Nothing is out front and nothing reaches out to grab you. Compare the explosive mix of something like The Song Remains the Same off of Houses of The Holy and that energy is just not there. That said. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve pulled Coda out for decades.

            "answer_text": "In my estimation it is \u2018In Through The Out Door\u2019, though votes for \u2018Presence\u2019 or \u2018Coda\u2019 or are just as valid. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a good LP by most band\u2019s standards, but it doesn\u2019t really sound like a Zep record, due to Page\u2019s negligible contributions. The band had really run out of steam due to many factors but at the time of the recording of \u2018out door\u2019 Page\u2019s addiction and Bonham\u2019s alcoholism were out of control. So much so that Plant and Jones reportedly would work by day and page and Bonham would arrive at night, sometimes, to add their efforts to what the singer and bassist had done. Although Page is given perfunctory co-songwriting credits on half the tunes, for his guitar parts I assume, in truth all the songs belonged to the morning crew, with a much heavier than usual JPJ influence. Some of Plant\u2019s attempts to broaden and try to remain relevant in a changing musical landscape (similar to Jagger\u2019s sometimes ill-advised attempts with the Stones) on the album were unwarranted. At least the thrown-together and uneven \u2018Coda\u2019, or the mediocre and bland \u201cPresence\u2019 still sounded like Zeppelin, while \u201cOut Door\u201d sounds like a Plant/Jones Band album with Page as a guest guitarist with some god-awful drumming/percussion. Like I said though, still a good record but, in my view LZ\u2019s worst. ",
