            "answer_text": "Hey there, I know there are some amazing answers down the line and it feels good to see people motivating others to do productive activities :) But I would personally like to add on some activities and include some of the earlier mentioned based on what I\u2019m doing now; Keep a good Mental healthWhile the outbreak of the pandemic has created a lot of chaos in many of our lives, it\u2019s time that we make ourselves mentally stronger! You can try Meditation - a great way to tune your day. Even involving yourself in your hobbies (like writing is for me) is a great way to keep your Endorphins up. 2. Join Online classes A skill that you\u2019ve been trying to learn for long but never actually got the time? Well, now that you\u2019ve time, invest on it! May it be something related to science, learning web development or learning to sketch, you can find appropriate classes online. While choosing the platform is an open choice. 3. Learn a new Language While this one extends from the previous point, I would like to mention that learning a new language is a great way to engage your mind, while at the same time improve the scope of opportunities for you. In my case, I\u2019ve been learning Spanish (espa\u00f1ol) from an app called Duolingo. So far, it\u2019s been a real fun. 4. Invest time in your relations Though lockdown brings us physically out of reach, but in today\u2019s social media world, it\u2019s no more a problem. Try and connect to your friends, family or other relatives. Meeting new people is a great way to increase your friends\u2019 circle! 5. Try cooking! You know we have only one-tenth of actually talented chefs who opt for professional training in this field! While because the rest of us, who have great potential to be a Masterchef never reach out for our kitchen doors. Come on! cooking is an absolute fun activity which all of us must try out. It not only gives the maker a successful pleasure, but brings smiles on the faces of the foodies in your family. 6. Maintain good Physical health While I\u2019ve mentioned about mental health earlier, we must not turn our eyes from physical health. Go and pick up those Dumbbells, skipping ropes, treadmills, yoga mats which haven\u2019t been touched lately. Another great way of physical activity is to play a sport. Pick up any sport you like unless it does not breakdown any appliance or anyone\u2019s head! 7. Increase your knowledge And a great way to do this is to read, read and read as much as you can! Watching news or Youtube, listening to good podcasts can also be great alternatives. Though I\u2019ll still stress on reading books. Once you discover your dusty books, you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s a large range of subjects that books cover. You\u2019ll surely find the best suit for yourself. Moreover, audiobooks or Ebooks shall help increase your library. 8. Know yourself better In our hustled life, very rarely do we get time to truly discover ourselves. Now, that we have all the time in this world, why not dig into the most interesting, yet complicated place - our mind? Go ahead, relax and just ponder upon yourself. Introspect yourself. You may even start journaling, like I\u2019m doing. Somewhere, this also connects to the very first point of mental health and meditation. So, I guess that was all I had for now. And trust me, these activities have helped keep my days busy and fully productive. So, why not try them out for yourselves? (Also, binge watching web series can be a good opt for a cheat day! Enjoy!) A last word for this post - Spend a lot of time with your family cause you\u2019ll soon realize that they are great companions. Love yourself and be Positive!

            "answer_text": "There are no particular things or skills one should learn just because we're home quarantined for some period of time. it's just an individual choice you either learn something or you can just pass the time by doing things what u like, say watching movies, playing indoor games etc.. don't beat yourself too much for not learning any new skills in this Quarantine time(the main purpose of present Quarantine is to make sure the Human Legacy is safe from the current pandemic covid-19..and we're fulfilling that by staying home :)) If are still feeling that you have so much idle time then try to list activities which you wanted to do since long time but postponed many times due to of lack of time. Things like fitness (you can do few home workouts which i listed some in earlier answer or you can even search in youtube for more), cooking, learning new languages what u wanted ( by watching that language movies without subtitles makes bit familiar with the language), singing etc\u2026those things may differ from person to person, you just decide things what you like and also which are possible to do in home, Then what are you waiting for\u2026. start. don't bother much about not being an expert in that particular activity. everyone has to start somewhere, also remember it is better to try things what you like n be somewhere and not left with regrets than not starting them at all\u2026 Have a good day\u2026\u263a\ufe0f # Stay home n stay safe.
