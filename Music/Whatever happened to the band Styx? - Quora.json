            "answer_text": "Styx is still performing and released an album in 2017, their first since 2005. The album, \u201cMission to Mars\u201d is receiving very positive reviews. Of the classic Styx line-up, only Tommy Shaw and James J.Y. Young (both vocals and guitar) remain as full-time members, and bassist Chuck Panozzo, who is living with HIV, performs when he can. Their famous former frontman, Dennis DeYoung, is touring with a band and playing Styx songs. Due to creative differences, he was ousted from the band in 1999 after his health was preventing him from touring. Essentially, it was an excuse to go on without him. ",
