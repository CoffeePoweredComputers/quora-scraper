This was 2002 or so. He introduced me to System of A Down and Godsmack and Tool and Korn\u2026which I immediately loved because I knew it would drive Mom and Dad insane\u2026but it felt like my eyes (and ears) were opened. I loved it all because I was newly emancipated and for the first time in my life, I was making my own decisions. Yay, music!! ^_^ ",
