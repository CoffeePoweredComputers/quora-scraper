            "answer_text": "Real art. A tremendous amount of \u201cart\u201d produced since Warhol\u2019s death is not art at all. Chuck Close and the bullshit artist who does the bubble puppies are not artists; they are designers, crafters, money-makers, millers. William Morris\u2019s wallpaper from Kelmscott was high art compared to blow-up self-portraits by Close and silly balls of touchable color that other guy churns out. . . In looking for the right gallery for my work in NYC, L.A. San Francisco, Austin, and Dallas, I found one gallery that actually shows real art sometimes, Cinq Gallery on Dragon Street in Dallas. Honestly, for at least 20 years I have seen no new SUCCESSFUL art that really is art. I have seen lots of art consistently produced that is really good, real art, but almost none of it sells above the $2,500 to $3,000 range. Here\u2019s the deal. Take three days in NYC. For four hours per day go to the top art galleries and search for art comparable in power to Henry Moore\u2019s, Rodin\u2019s, Steiglitz\u2019s, Van Gogh\u2019s, Still\u2019s, Hopper\u2019s, Frankenthaler\u2019s, Pollock\u2019s, Rembrandt\u2019s, Cezanne\u2019s, Lautrec\u2019s, Rothko\u2019s, Arbus\u2019s. . . You will fail. This is a fact: Ten years ago I went to one of the top galleries in Dallas, Texas and saw raccoon feces in an ashtray for $10,000. In a corner were stacked white plastic bags full of dirt \u201cUntitled\u201d for $10,000. I\u2019ll bet a donut hole that some rich tasteless dumbass bought the bags of dirt. Real art contains a small amount of soul. Real love contains 99.99% soul. Real art like Manet\u2019s might anger people but Christ is IN his painting \u201cDead Christ with Angels.\u201d Goya\u2019s black paintings mean horror\u2019s body. Van Gogh\u2019s fields fulfill Joy. You can actually climb into Steiglitz\u2019s flatiron building on Fifth Avenue (Steichen?). Clyfford Still\u2019s stimmung scares me. The real art today is in museums and a few houses or sold over the past 20 years for under $10,000. ",

            "answer_text": "I enjoy all kind of art but definitely I consider cinema as the most complete of all of them. I mean we can find pieces of art on those instances of drama. I would like to be more specific, even though I know it is very hard to describe all those feelings of movies. Anyway, I can write some examples to clarify what i meant. About the art of music, which i find amazing, there are some movies in which we can find the best kind of music in their soundtracks, this mixed with the whole visual stuff make a great audovisual show. Movies like 2001 Space odyssey or Pulp fiction are 2 nice examples, because of the way how both of them show that to us. A lot of movies have scenes of the most beautiful places on the world, showing how amazing the sculpture and architecture are. I know there are some very bad movies, I am aware of that. Anyway everyone has his own opinion. In my case, I prefer movies based on novels or comics. Those are quality literature. In my point of view, we can find in a Staley Kubrick\u2019s movie what we can not in a simple photo or picture, By the way I'm not saying that cinema is totally complete, but i think is nearly to be, haha lol. They are exciting, lovable, interesting and most important the are not pretentious at all. To sum up, some books are very well adapted to the big screen, for instances one of my favorites novels \u00a8The green mile\u00a8by Stephen King. I would say I prefer the book in this case, but the movie is also fantastic. Disctrack yourself with a picture for 5 minutes or with a music album for one hour if you want, but i would rather a marathon of movies watching Scar face for third time or maybe American History X. People usually prefer movies instead of books and I don\u2019t blame them, they are very similar for me, but obviously movies are shorter and easier to understand.  ",
