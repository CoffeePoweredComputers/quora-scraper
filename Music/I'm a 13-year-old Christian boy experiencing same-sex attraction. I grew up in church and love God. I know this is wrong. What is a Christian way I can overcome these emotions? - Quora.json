            "answer_text": "You probably cannot but understand this. 2 things. 1st \u2026Augustin wrote the \u201c disordered loves\" idea. He purposed that evil was here before creation and man cannot create or generate new evil. He purposed that every human desire or (love) came from God who created us in his image. So every sin or evil mankind engages in is basically a misplaced (love) given to us by God. For example man is given the desire to build and create through work. This is a God given (Love). However the Bible is explicit in its message that mankind's purpose is to worship or (love) God above all else. Adam failed loving Eve more than God. Thus our love to work can become sin if it is put above our love of family or God. The struggle of humanity is to correctly order its loves by keeping God first. In your case behind your homosexual desire is a God given Love. Whether it has been warped in human interactions is probably true but it has at its core a God image. The same can be said for a heterosexual man who is married but works with a female he finds intellectually, spiritually and physically attractive. The desire to have relationship with that female cannot be denied it is God given. The married man cannot act on that love because he must put the God love and his wife love above that of his desire for the attractive female. His love and loyalty to God are tested just as yours is. To act towards God as your first love. The temptation and desire that the West has stressed as truth are not truth. The fact you desire this is not a complete truth it is just a small truth for you. Truth is absolute, we are defined by our creator we do not define ourselves. You have a choice to define or get your identity from your desires or to subvert them to your identity in the creator and to Love him first as your supplier of all that you need. Adam failed this test when God was absent in the Garden\u2026he would not Love God first who created Eve but instead put his identity into Eve who gave him a God given pleasure. The creator must define you or something (idol)else will. The only person to beat death is Jesus Christ\u2026.all men die\u2026will you trust God the eternal or that which dies. ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t. You realize that God loves you the way he created you. I would recommend letting your hormones stabilize and your brain mature before getting too carried away. Ex 2\u20133 X /week 50+ year old cradle Catholic. You can be the type of person who searches through the Bible actively searching for a reason to make the life of someone who has done you no harm into a living hell or you can follow the theme below. The psychosis of scape goating and magical thinking is another whole topic. First research the latest translations from Hebrew. I have heard the no homosexual texts are actually objecting to a Greek pedophilia practice. Almost nothing in the Bible about lesbians. [Excerpt] Acts 8:26-40English Standard Version (ESV) Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, \u201cRise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.\u201d This is a desert place. And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah, And the Spirit said to Philip, \u201cGo over and join this chariot.\u201d So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, \u201cDo you understand what you are reading?\u201d And he said, \u201cHow can I, unless someone guides me?\u201d And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: \u201cLike a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he opens not his mouth. In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth.\u201d And the eunuch said to Philip, \u201cAbout whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?\u201d Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus. As they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, \u201cSee, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?\u201d And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea [excerpt]. Under Hebrew law, a eunuch would not have been allowed to worship at the temple. He would never have made it past the immersion baths and would have been sent to join the women and children. A eunuch would have been as close to trans-gender as medical science was possible of at the time. What is God\u2019s order to the Church? Run after him. As soon as the eunuch understands that he has the potential for full participation and welcome into the community he jumps for joy and takes the first chance he gets to be baptized. The Bible says absolutely nothing about lesbianism. In all primates, it is a survival trait to avoid being beaten up by the inferior males. The inferior males hit. They know the females won\u2019t voluntarily mate with them, so they terrorize them to make them too afraid to refuse. See patriarchal religions on inferiority of women. The Old Testament has about 1 sentence on gay men. Homosexuality didn\u2019t even make the 10 commandments. So I would say I don\u2019t understand the confusion. The Church\u2019s position on transgender and homosexuality is quite clear and joyfully, fully welcomes them into the Church under direct orders from God. ",
