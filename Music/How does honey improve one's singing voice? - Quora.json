            "answer_text": "First off, one thing we know for sure is that nothing you eat or drink actually contacts the vocal folds.  See the epiglottis immediately below the tongue? When you swallow, that flap of cartilaginous tissue moves downwards, sealing off the top of the larynx and directing the food or liquid down the esophagus instead. This prevents anything you eat or drink from contacting the vocal folds or entering the lungs. So, it's impossible for anything you consume to \"lubricate\" or \"coat\" the vocal folds directly; if you somehow got some honey on your vocal folds by accident, you'd have a coughing fit. Why is it good for singers to drink liquids, then? Well, when you are dehydrated, your mucous membranes -- such as your mouth, nose, and yes, vocal folds too -- dry out. Breathing in lots of dry air can also dry out those tissues. So the liquids you drink do help the vocal folds, but indirectly: they keep you hydrated, so that your vocal folds stay moist. Dried-out vocal folds don't vibrate as well as moist ones, so this extra hydration helps you sing and speak. As for honey, if it makes you feel good, by all means use it. Warm liquid, such as tea with honey, can bring some more blood flow to the mouth and throat, and perhaps prompt nearby muscles to relax (in much the same way that a soak in the jacuzzi can loosen up your muscles).

            "answer_text": "Honey does not improve the voice, but it will sooth a voice that is stressed out by a cold and/or overwork. I believe it acts as a lubricant on the vocal chords and this is why many experts recommend a combination of tea and honey for a stressed voice. Other lubricants include a drink of Aloe Vera.  Drinks to avoid - alcohol and coffee since they tend to strip your vocal chords of its natural lubrication. ",
