            "answer_text": "Boston Acoustics spends more on research and development while Bose spends more on marketing. Boston acoustics speakers tend to be better as a result. Keep in mind though, depending on budget, there are much better options. For example, GoldenEar Triton 7 Towers can be had for the same $1400 as Boston Acoustics RS 334 Towers, but the GoldenEar Towers are leaps and bounds better. The same applies in car audio - the similarly priced priced Polk, Alpine, and many others will outperform both Bose and Boston Acoustics. When it comes down to it, whether for home or car audio, I\u2019d personally look beyond Bose and Boston Acoustics. If I had to choose between the two, though\u2026 Boston Acoustics. ",

However, given that Boston Acoustics is no longer producing, the answer must, by definition, be Bose. Footnotes[1] Boston Acoustics - Wikipedia",
