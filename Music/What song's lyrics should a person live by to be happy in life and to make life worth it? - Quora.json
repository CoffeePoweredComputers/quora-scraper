            "answer_text": "As soon as I read this question, this song automatically started playing in my head - Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai (Movie - Anari, Year - 1959). Here's the translation for you: Kisi Ki Muskurahaton Pe Ho Nisar Kisi Ka Dard Mil Sake To Le Udhaar Kisi Ke Vaaste Ho Tere Di Mein Pyaar Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai  \"Fall for someone\u2019s smile. Borrow somebody's sorrow if possible. Harbor love for somebody in your heart. To live is to do the above\" Maana Apni Jeb Se Faqeer Hain Phir Bhi Yaaro Dil Ke Ham Ameer Hain Mite Jo Pyaar Ke Liye Wo Zindagi Jale Bahar Ke Liye Wo Zindagi Kisi Ko Ho Na Ho, Hame To Aitbaar Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai  \"I agree that if you look in my pocket, you\u2019ll see that I\u2019m poor.In spite of that, I am rich at heart.Life is what perishes for love, life is what craves for spring.We have belief even if others don't, and such is life.\" Rishta Dil Se Dil Ke Aitbaar Ka Zinda Hai Hamee Se Naam Pyar Ka Ke Mar Ke Bhi Kisi Ko Yaad Aayenge Kisi Ke Aansuyon Mein Muskuraayenge Kahega Phool Har Kali Se Baar Baar Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai  \"Every heart to heart relationship is about trust and belief. Love lives on because of us.Even after death we will be remembered,We will smile through someone\u2019s tearful memoriesAnd every flower will tell the bud time and again, this is how living is\u201d Here's the song:   Hope you enjoy it! :D ",
