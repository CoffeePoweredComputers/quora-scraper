            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going out on a limb and say by \u201cproducer\u201d you mean the sort of common-usage \u201cthe person who makes beats and music that other performers use\u201d definition, and not the more industry-specific variations. Although, either way, it\u2019s pretty damn hard. It\u2019s not hard to become a producer. Fire up Garageband or FLStudio or whatever and start churning stuff out and you can accurately call yourself a producer in minutes. It\u2019s hard to become a good producer. I\u2019ve been writing, producing and engineering music for myself and others for 20 years and I still think I\u2019ve got a lot to learn. Nonetheless, some people are talented. Maybe you can get there quickly. Then comes the proverbial lightning strike. Somebody has to hear it and buy your services. So you need to be good at marketing yourself. Maybe that somebody is an up and coming local rapper. Maybe it\u2019s a local car dealership that wants a new jingle. Who knows. It\u2019s a start. Do it. Be as goddamned professional as possible. Get everything done, meet your deadlines, don\u2019t get cocky. Then aggressively market your experience. So great, after all that you\u2019re an experienced musician-producer. Now you want to make a living off of it. That\u2019s the hard part. The industry is over-saturated right now, and the amount clients are willing to pay is dropping quickly. If you\u2019re lucky, you can get a steady job doing something like game audio or as an in-house composer/producer for a marketing firm. Those are rare positions, but they\u2019re more secure. It\u2019s a game that requires a lot of hustle on top of skill and practice and talent. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, you don\u2019t define what you mean by \u201cmoney\u201d so it\u2019s hard to reply. In general, it is an extremely competitive game where it\u2019s difficult and It takes a few years to get even one first small placement. Making a living from it is even harder. To give you some statistics, according to PRS for music, less than 10% of their registered songwriters and producers earn more than \u00a35,000 a year. Bear in mind that to register with PRS you must have had at least one commercial release. personally it took me 3 years since I started writing commercially to get my first placement. 5 years to get my first platinum placement. Even now, after three platinum placements and 1.8 million records sold, I am in an \u201cunstable\u201d situation where if the placements don\u2019t continue steadily royalties from old placements will not be enough to earn a living regularly. My first platinum placement came for a girl group where the record label had received about a thousand professional demos, from established writers signed to publishers or with a track record, and my song was among the 6 chosen for the mini-album. In summary, you have to be totally committed and insanely driven to make it in the music industry as a producer. Most people are driven by their unconditional passion regardless of the hardship. Without this kind of commitment you are unlikely to make it. Edit: I looked at the other answers.. I assumed you already know your craft, else it takes much longer, probably ten years at least, like in any high level professional setting. I also assumed you meant producer in the sense of someone who either makes tracks or produces songs written piano and voice by artists/writers. Roles blur a lot nowadays and producers are often considered as writers in their own right, as well as writers can be vocal producers or also track producers. The more skills you have, the higher the chance to make it. ",
