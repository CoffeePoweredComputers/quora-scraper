Song- Try yo find a song that matches with your voice and the rhythm. So lets say you can do a high note try to find a song that has a high note in it and try it or try another song that has a lot or a few high notes try that song. Now lets say you can\u2019t really do high note , try to find a song that does not have a high note Now lets say you can do both, try to find a song that has both and that one should be pretty easy there are a lot of songs that has both.
