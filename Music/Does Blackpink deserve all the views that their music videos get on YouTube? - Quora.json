            "answer_text": "No. Not all of them. I don't want to offend any BLINK but, many people who watch their MVs are for their visuals.  I agree that they are beautiful and talented but, it is very unlikely of a music video like \u201cDdu-Ddu-Ddu\" to get 1 billion views if it weren't for their visuals. I had been a BLINK and I listened to their songs just because they had a good beat. Some of their lyrics are cringey and it's annoying sometimes. I mean, Jisoo is pretty,  so is Jennie,  Rose,  and Lisa.  All 4 of them can be good models but, to be a good Kpop idol they should improve and YG should stop favouring Jennie and restricting them. That's all! Keep it mellow! ",
