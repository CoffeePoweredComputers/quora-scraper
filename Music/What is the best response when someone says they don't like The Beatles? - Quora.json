            "answer_text": "I've learned that most people today don't really know The Beatles. These persons usually just know the same Beatles songs everyone else does.I was lucky, because my mother used to listen to The Beatles and so I listened to them from a very young age. But I remember that a few years ago my best friend said he disliked The Beatles. I was a big fan and said I don't understand, but I didn't say anything else. I listened to The Beatles all the time and that went on for months without another word about it. Than one day he sais he was learning Blackbird on the guitar. (I was also started learning Blackbird on the guitar the same week as he did, so that was funny.) I was surprised. Later on he started to listen to other Beatles songs too. Usually when I listened to a song at first he said it was bad and said I shouldn't listen to that kind of crap. Than a few days later he would be listening to the same 'crap' and say that he realised that it's actually cool.Today he is also a huge Beatles fan and just like me he listens to them and sings their songs all the day through. We even formed a band.The only thing I did was listen to different Beatles music until one day my friend heard one he liked - and that was Blackbird - and got interested. So I think the best way to handle people who doesn't like The Beatles is let him or her listen to Beatles music they haven't heard yet (either directly or indirectly). Don't say anything, especially not that the music he or she listens is crap, just 'make' them discover the real music. They will not care about the facts, only about the music. Eventually there will be at least one or two songs (out of the more than 200) by The Fab Four they like. ",

            "answer_text": "First thing to do is ask them why. Usually it's because they don't like the music, they think the band is overrated, or because it's just \"trendy\" to dislike the band. If they genuinely don't like the music, ask them specifically what it is that they dislike. Then, try to show them songs that aren't the typical radio favorites. Or you could take the high road and explain to them the significance and genius behind \"A Day in The Life.\" Always ask the person who their favorite artists are. Eight times out of ten, it will be someone whom the Beatles have influenced, directly or indirectly. Try to explain the significance of the Beatles impact on these artists, and show the person songs which highlight that influence. For example, if someone is a big R&B fsn, show them some things like \"Nowhere Man\" and explain the significance of the harmonization. In this instance, you could also explain how royalties from their cover of \"Money\" gave Berry Gordy the money necessary to successfully establish motown records. When someone claims that the band is overrated, try to explain the scope of what the band accomplished in such a short amount of timr, and the lasting influence that the group still has on today's society. You can cite that the Beatles rock band video game was the highest selling in all of the game's franchise. You can show that the band's songwriting styles can still be heard in the musicians of today, from pop to rock to country and everything in between. You can also explain what the Beatles accomplished as far as recording and production goes, and how the techniques that they along with George Martin developed are still being utilized in today's studios. If you're dealing with someone who dislikes the band for some completely irrational reason such as the sake of being trendy, perhaps you should reevaluate your relationship with this individual to begin with.
