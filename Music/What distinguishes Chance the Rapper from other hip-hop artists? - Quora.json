            "answer_text": "In terms of his music? Absolutely nothing. Sometimes in this industry, it takes the right people to push your material and your agenda forward. First off, he had a Kanye west co-sign. Next, he has the youth movement (which in my opinion is the most relevant movement currently) and lastly, he had president Obama recognize him due to his daughters being huge fans. His music is positive yes, but so are other artists. He knew what he had to do. I remember when I first heard chance the rapper, he was going hard with vulgar lyrics on a trap beat but then he went quiet and realized that this did not work. Then, he puts out acid raps (youthful in genre and taste) and now he's a global success. At the end of the day, what separates him is the kid is calculating. ",

            "answer_text": "Chance is one of the best wordsmiths in the game right now, but I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s better than Kendrick Lamar. what sets Chance apart is how distinctively joyful he is, even when he\u2019s rapping about intense issues. This comes through not only in the songs themselves (which tend to be pretty upbeat), but also in his performances\u2014it\u2019s hard to catch him not smiling. This was particularly true in Coloring Book, but it\u2019s also true of Acid Rap (although somewhat less so in 10 Day). Chance really looks like he is having fun doing what he\u2019s doing and he seems grateful. A good mental model: Chance the Rapper is a \u201cclever, joyful, and passionate Gen Y.5er\u201d. ",
