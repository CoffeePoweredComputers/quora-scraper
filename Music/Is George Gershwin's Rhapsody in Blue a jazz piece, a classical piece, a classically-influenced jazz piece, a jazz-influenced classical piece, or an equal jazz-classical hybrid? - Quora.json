            "answer_text": "Jazz, no matter what the style or subgenre (i.e. boogie woogie, funk, free-jazz, etc.), almost by definition includes some element of improvisation. The Rhapsody in Blue, however, has no improvisation whatsoever. It is entirely notated, even the rather free-flowing cadenza-like passages for piano solo (which could have been improvised, as cadenzas used to be in Mozart and Beethoven's day). For that reason, I'd say that I'd lean strongly toward  it being defined as a 'jazz-influenced classical piece'. Yes, it was written for a Jazz Band/orchestra, and there are plenty of jazz-inspired gestures, harmonies and rhythms, but when you get right down to it, it's still a piece of traditional, 19th century style piano and 'ensemble' writing with lots of jazz inflections. I wouldn't ever describe it as a classically-influenced jazz piece, and calling it an equal jazz-classical hybrid just seems to ignore the lack of free improvisation that is at the heart of all jazz performances. I keep thinking of the story of when the great classical Polish/American pianist Arthur Rubinstein visited with the equally extraordinary jazz piano virtuoso Art Tatum. After a good deal of talk and  mutual appreciation, Rubinstein sat at the keyboard and played his famous 'Variations on The Stars and Stripes Forever'.  Tatum loved, it, and then sat down and played his own 'Variations' on the same tune, for the next 20 minutes, making the variations up on the fly. This is not to say that one pianist was better than the other, but this is in essence the big difference between Jazz and Classical music. Classical music is thought through, and usually written out and played from the score (with some notable exceptions, including the aforementioned cadenzas as well as figured bass and 20th and 21st  century pieces that call for more improvisation). Jazz is about composing 'on the fly'. There are good things about both of these kinds of music, but they are not the same, at least most of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It was originally through-composed by Gershwin and orchestrated by Ferde Grof\u00e9, whose contribution to it is consistently underrated, and in its original form it contains no scope for improvisation. As such, the Gershwin/Grof\u00e9 Rhapsody can hardly be considered a jazz piece, although it certainly uses jazz inflections. However, I\u2019m a little wary of assigning Rhapsody in Blue the same kind of status as, say, Beethoven\u2019s Fourth Piano Concerto. The Rhapsody is a curious work in that unlike most classical works, but like most jazz tunes, it is not irrevocably tied to a definitive score. (It shares this quality with one of the most famous of all classical works, Handel\u2019s Messiah.) Gershwin\u2019s original manuscript was for two pianos, but in order to be performed by Whiteman\u2019s band, which had commissioned it, it had to be scored by Grof\u00e9, Whiteman\u2019s arranger. Ever since its original performance, it\u2019s been criticised for lacking the kind of organic form you\u2019d expect in a full-length classical work. Leonard Bernstein\u2019s justly famous comment on it is worth repeating in full: The Rhapsody is not a composition at all. It's a string of separate paragraphs stuck together. The themes are terrific, inspired, God-given. I don't think there has been such an inspired melodist on this earth since Tchaikovsky. But if you want to speak of a composer, that's another matter. Your Rhapsody in Blue is not a real composition in the sense that whatever happens in it must seem inevitable. You can cut parts of it without affecting the whole. You can remove any of these stuck-together sections and the piece still goes on as bravely as before. It can be a five-minute piece or a twelve-minute piece. And in fact, all these things are being done to it every day. And it's still the Rhapsody in Blue. It has been performed and recorded by jazz musicians, and one of the most epic versions of it, which entirely bears out Bernstein\u2019s remarks, is a re-arrangement for big band by the Scottish saxophonist and composer Tommy Smith, which was originally recorded by the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra in 2009. It takes up the space of an entire CD and contains ample room for improvisation. (You can find it here, if you\u2019re interested: Rhapsody In Blue) The SNJO version of Rhapsody undoubtedly qualifies as a jazz work. It was inspired by its featured soloist, pianist Brian Kellock, whose habit of noodling entire passages of Rhapsody in Blue prompted Smith to re-orchestrate the piece as a showcase for him. So, yes, the original version/s of Rhapsody in Blue were not jazz works; but the ontological status of the work being as uncertain as it is, it can be one. ",
