            "answer_text": "The biggest issue is that BTS doesn\u2019t really fit Coachella at this point. They can sell out multiple stadium nights in LA just a couple of hours away, drawing a crowd roughly equivalent to Coachella\u2019s entire attendance. Imagine what would happen if they performed there - the fanbase would completely overrun the festival. By the way it\u2019s true that other stadium-touring acts like Beyonc\u00e9 have performed there, but her fanbase has had a lot more opportunities to see her over the years by now and probably wouldn\u2019t be nearly as aggressive about getting tickets. I also think Coachella is just becoming receptive to pop recently, and pop groups are the last to be invited as they have particularly little \u201ccool\u201d credibility (which Coachella is all about) in America. One Direction, Fifth Harmony, the Jonas Brothers, and Little Mix were never invited to perform. Blackpink is the first and if it goes well perhaps there will be more in the future. Finally there\u2019s the label issue - Interscope signed Blackpink and is developing them somewhat like a regular western artist which includes the usual media rounds. By the time BTS got the attention of the western industry they were already selling out multiple arena nights in LA. Again, not a good fit. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer by John Morgan is really good, but I just wanted to add my bit. I remember after they won Billboard the first time, I got onto Tumblr because I knew it would be going crazy over these boys I absolutely loved and wanted to see what people were saying. There I read something along the lines of \u201cBTS is completely booked for the next two years.\u201d It also showed a bit of evidence that made me believe it and as time has progressed, I think it was proven to be true. That said, I think Coachella just didn't book them in time. I'm sure they wanted BTS because imagine all the money you could make off of ARMYs coming to this already popular festival. Everyone wants BTS. They are in high demand, meaning if you don't get them quickly, you don't get them at all. I think this was just one of the cases. So, of course, as soon as BLACKPINK seemed to be gaining American popularity, people expected what happened to BTS to happen to them and invited BLACKPINK to perform immediately. This way they can still have someone viewed as popular, lots of BLINKs to come spend money, and seem proactive in the kpop community. ",
