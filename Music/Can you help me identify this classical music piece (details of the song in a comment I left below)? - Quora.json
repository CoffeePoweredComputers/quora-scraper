            "answer_text": "I first wrote: Since you\u2019ve attached no sound clip, my best guess is that it is 4\u203233\u2033 by John Cage. But since then the question-asker has commented, and clarified: The piece was definitely in a minor key. By my basic classical music knowledge, I\u2019m guessing it was by a Russian composer from the 19th or 20th century. The song\u2019s striking feature was that it starts with a sudden dense chord in the bass, followed by a really cool three- or four-octave arpeggio that went from the bass, up the keyboard and back down again. It rings a bell with me - in fact I\u2019m almost certain I can hear a piece that matches the description in my head! - but I can\u2019t place it instantly. Can anyone else help? ",

            "answer_text": "A few contenders come to mind: Chopin, Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23 Chopin, \u00c9tudes Op. 10 and Op. 25 (click through all 24) Scriabin, Piano Sonata No. 1, Op. 6 Liszt, \u00c9tudes d'ex\u00e9cution transcendante, S.139 (click through all twelve) It\u2019s hard to suggest anything more specific with the limited information provided. You might have some luck going through the ouevres of Russian composers (if you are certain it was Russian) on YouTube (many videos amalgamate a large number of pieces together) and testing each one. Otherwise, could you reach out to the pianist and ask what the piece was? Or perhaps someone else who was there with you at the time? ",

Can you describe the overall mood of the piece - sad, lament, angry, joyous, slow, fast, dramatic, serious, comic\u2026 and about how long? 1 or 2 minutes? 8 or 9 minutes? If it was sung, do you recall if it was in Russian, German, or any other language you recognized? Did it have any kind of descriptive title? Was it for piano only - a piano recital piece? ",
