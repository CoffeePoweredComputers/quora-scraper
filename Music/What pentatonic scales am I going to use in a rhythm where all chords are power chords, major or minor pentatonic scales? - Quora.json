            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s say your progression is a simple I-IV-V: A-D-E. Those root notes appear in BOTH an A Major and A minor scale. You\u2019re playing the chords as power chords (5 chords). The fifths of each, E, A, and B, also appear in both A Major and A minor. What makes something major or minor is the third of the scale. This is also known as a guide tone. A Major: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#A minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G Pentatonic scales contain five notes of a diatonic scale (the full Major and minor scales you see above). To build pentatonic scales: Major: root, 2, 3, 5, 6minor: root, 3, 4, 5, 7 So\u2026 A Major pentatonic: A, B, C#, E, F#A minor pentatonic: A, C, D, E, G All of the notes of the original I-IV-V chord progression work in both.Note that while the D is not included in the Major pentatonic and the B is not in the minor pentatonic, they are in both diatonic scales.

            "answer_text": "What about trying to play some scales and listen carefully to what happens? Notes don\u2019t bite and no one is going to punish you if notes sound wrong. Simply, if you like it that\u2019s fine, if you don\u2019t like it try something else. It\u2019s also way faster than ask on Quora and wait for answers. I suggest you to be less frightened by music theory and a bit more self confident. Try to play whatever you want to play, and only afterwards if you like the result you may pay attention to what you are doing from a theoretical point of view. And then analyse it more deeply. ",
