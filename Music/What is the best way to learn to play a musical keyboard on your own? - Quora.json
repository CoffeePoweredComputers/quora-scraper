            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re going to learn the keyboard on your own, there are really only 3 ways to do it. Playing by Ear This is where you listen to the piece of music you want to learn to play and then replicate it on the keyboard. For most people, this is very difficult and time consuming. You\u2019ll get better at figuring out the notes to songs over time but you\u2019ll likely get discouraged due to the lack of progress. Watching Youtube Videos This is the path many choose because it\u2019s free. There are tons of videos on Youtube showing you how to play certain songs and teaching you things like scales and note reading. This is way better than figuring out things on your own but this also takes a lot of time since the lessons won\u2019t be structured. You\u2019ll be jumping around a lot and will likely miss a lot of crucial skill building techniques that will accelerate your learning. Follow A Piano Course In terms of being efficient and making great progress in less time, this is the best way to go about learning the keyboard. It\u2019s like having a piano teacher but you get to go at your own pace and it cost a lot less. Here\u2019s the best keyboard course that I know of. It has hundreds of hours of videos and the method used to teach you is highly effective. It\u2019s not free like the other 2 ways but you\u2019ll be able to learn to play the keyboard a lot faster. On top of that, you\u2019ll get the foundation and important techniques down which will enable you to learn new songs faster as well as come up with your own songs. Price vs Time I assume you\u2019re not taking lessons from a teacher because it costs too much money. Many people feel the same way. You could certainly learn to play some songs by watching free videos on Youtube but if you want to get good in a short amount of time, get the course. It doesn\u2019t even cost that much and you\u2019ll be saving a lot of time. What is your time worth? Practice Regardless of which way you choose to learn to play the keyboard, you need to practice. Take the time to practice each day, even if it\u2019s just 10 minutes. Skill is built through repetition. The course will show you how to practice efficiently which is important because just playing random songs during your practice session will only get you so far. Start Today I wish I had learned to play when I was younger but I didn\u2019t. I could\u2019ve started years earlier but I kept putting it off, probably due to being afraid I would suck at it as well as not knowing where to start. I\u2019ve been playing for a few years now and love it. It\u2019s a great way to entertain friends and family as well as reduce stress. ",

            "answer_text": "My best advice is learn by doing\u2026 back in 1990 I was just 14, I had no musical background and no desire to be musical, I was grounded and put my time to good use by learning how to use protracker (an early music production software), I got good with it despite knowing nothing about music, so good. That in 1992 I got my first record deal before I'd even left school but even then I still couldn't play an instrument, by 1997 I'd signed to a number of labels as a producer and remixer and learned they keyboard as a nessecity for future production down to the software changing\u2026 I'm not a great player, I can play enough to carry a tune and produce music\u2026. Now in 2020 I'm still not a great player, I can play enough and what I need to, I have a number of keyboards and controllers now, I'm still heavily involved in the music industry, I can produce entire albums single handedly, sometimes I never play a single note on a keyboard because I've learned to produce visually ",
