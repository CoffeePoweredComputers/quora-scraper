            "answer_text": "For someone who blindly hate bts and don't know anything about them, who hates them just because they think it's edgy and cool to hate, say this: Did i ask?I have heard every homophobic and xenophobic comments about them. Try being creative and say something new.I love people talk about being open minded but when boybands like this come to the forefront, somehow all their openmindedness flies out of the window. It's as if men won't let those boybands survive because they are not majorly involved in it. And all those girls hating on it to make people think you're cool, edgy and different? Y'all are nothing but sheep-minded people looking for men's approval.If you get angry when someone insults your culture and your looks, then you're being a hypocrite because you're doing the same godd*mn thing. If it's sarcasm and it's a \u2018joke' then don't get angry when i make a joke out of your culture, your people, your looks and your country.When you call kpop men gay and how they look like girls, you're not only being a homophobic but also using women as a derogatory term. I guess your openmindedness just flies up in your a** then.And if you're talking about someone who is also a kpop fan but from another fandom, just say it's okay, it's your opinion. If they start insulting and saying \u201cbts is overrated\u201d, show them the charts and whatever bts achieved along with praises from Korea's president. That pisses them off lmao. And if they bring the \u201cquality over quantity\u201d card just say that every artist wants to get awards, recognition and be known for their music everywhere. if your fandom can't even do that for your favorite kpop group, it really shows how petty y'all are just because you want to follow your own narrative of \u201cstreaming is not everything\u201d when it is clearly affecting the group.

You are to small minded to understand that this group of amazing, talented singers and dancers has brought so many people new joy and light that has encouraged some to do new things and even saved some from dark times. Sorry for your stupidity. (Make sure to look sympathetic while saying this to make it more insulting. You\u2019re basically telling them how amazing BTS is while also telling them they\u2019re stupid) \u25c6 You: Thank you for contributing to the growing population of racists in this world. Really, it\u2019s not like we already have terrible things like war in this world, we really need that extra boost of stupidity and hate. Don\u2019t we?

This picture represents: Mic Drop  Idol Such amazing songs probably wouldn\u2019t have been made if there wasn\u2019t any haters, however that doesn\u2019t make hating right. I\u2019m not forcing you to like our boys but you should probably stop going out of your way to hurt someone you don\u2019t even know personally. Don\u2019t be jealous of other people\u2019S success and look out for only yourself. Here\u2019s some quotes from our beautiful leader on your way out:    Hope you enjoyed my answer feel free to ask me questions about Min Yoongi or BTS in general!   -semi- ",

Initially I was frustrated when someone talks bad abt BTS , but nowadays I stopped responding . One day , a guy particularly talked shit abt BTS to me, I muttered a single word \u201cJealousy\u201d and then I completely ignored him.That made him frustrated , he started shouting and arguing that he isn't jealous and that BTS is shit . I just sat there silent completely ignoring his existence and started scanning my phone. He was frustrated and that simple act made him speechless. So simply ignore. ",

Instead of letting yourself be hurt over that person, try to find someone who will respect your opinions fairly.However, if they aren\u2019t those sort of people, I would ask them the reason why they don\u2019t like BTS. I think meeting someone who has a different opinion from you, is a great chance to learn something new and mature in all sorts of ways. Talking with this person, and listening to what they have to say might give you an interesting new way to look at things. ;)",

Or you\u2019ll end up like someone to be disregarded, laughed at, or pitied. Never to be taken seriously. In other words, I think you\u2019re a pathetic, ignorant cry baby :) boohoo ",

Also, I don't think the opinion of people who hate them for petty reasons such as using makeup, not having a beard or masculinity according to them or terming them as gays really matter. I will welcome all the constructive criticism and try to look at the opinion from their eyes but I will never entertain hating any person for petty reasons. ",

It\u2019s only bringing the hate back to you but most importantly it\u2019s not going to change anything. BTS won\u2019t disband because of the worlds opinion. They will continue to strive for their careers and their fans. ",
