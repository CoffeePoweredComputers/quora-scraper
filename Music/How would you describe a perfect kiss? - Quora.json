It\u2019s the one you\u2019ve been moving towards\u2026slowly\u2026for what feels like years. It\u2019s the one that was freely given. It\u2019s the one that you have to close your eyes to fully experience. It\u2019s the one that feels like sunshine after days of rain. It\u2019s the one that gets taken with no regrets. It\u2019s the one that feels like you just came home after a long absence. It\u2019s the first soft rain after a drought. It starts slow before building to a crescendo. It\u2019s the one that steals your breath. It\u2019s neither too wet, nor too dry. It tastes sweet. It feels spicy. It\u2019s electric. It causes shivers from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet. It makes your toes curl. It makes you feel unsteady. And once it\u2019s over, all you want is more. ",

            "answer_text": "How would you describe a perfect kiss? Before I was married I had two kisses, from two different girls, that rocked my world. They were similar enough that I can describe both by describing only one. It begins with attraction, and anticipation. A nice date, good food, and a mutual interest in becoming physical. The kiss, when it happens, is a promise of things to come. A hesitation, unhurried, to provide the mindset so you can remember the moment. Then a quick peck of soft pursed lips, followed immediately by a hungry open mouth. Wet, and hot, and swollen. No tongue, just lips trying to swallow lips. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Hands\u2026 traveling curves with intent, gripping lightly, but with force. Encouraging, kneading, pleading, controlling\u2026 Soft skin and hard muscles, two bodies tentative, but with growing insistence. Caressing lightly at first but searching for ways to shape themselves into each other, to inhabit, to indulge, to become. The scent of passion\u2026 Breaking off is difficult, the mind stunned, the head light with vertigo. The world rocked. A promise\u2026 And I married the last one to kiss me like that. Forty years and she still rocks. I\u2019m a lucky man. EDIT: Forty-two years now. ",
