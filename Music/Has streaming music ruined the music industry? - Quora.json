            "answer_text": "No. Not yet at least... The downfall of the music industry started long before streaming was even possible. Music, per se, isn't ruined, but the flawed mechanism of selecting artists on their actual merits that was in place from the 60s until the coalescence of dozens of companies into the Big Four (Sony BMG, Universal Music Group, EMI, Warner Music Group) is not so much in evidence these days. In many ways, the loss of a diverse ecosystem of record labels, especially true independents, is what is making popular music so homogeneous. The reason that those companies either don't exist or exist in name only, is due to a downturn in sales that began in the Napster era. It's not a little ironic that directly before sales took a dive, the record industry was enjoying its all-time peak. Of course, streaming isn't helping, but for an entirely different reason. The cut that artists get from streaming (as opposed to actual airplay, and of course, actual sales) is tiny. For Spotify, the worst offender, the blended mechanical rate for ad-supported and premium services is $0.00043 per stream. Other services, such as Pandora pay slightly better, but it's still a slap in the face to the artist and their craft. So, for the aspiring musician the take-away is that a difficult career just got even more tough. It's like stiffing the waiter who needs tips to make a living wage. Streaming services have valuations in the hundreds of million or even billions of dollars, but they seem to forget that without the content, they are worth nothing. They need content to justify high valuations, and without that content they would be worthless. It's as if they are valuing the users over the creators. And, to that end, there is a small revolution taking place. We've all heard of the grumblings of Taylor Swift and the subsequent removal of her work from Spotify. There are other acts following suit, too. The band Tool have no content on any streaming service... nor on iTunes. To make matters worse, it was revealed in late 2015 that up to 25% of streaming royalties couldn't be accounted for due to \"identification difficulties\". It turns out that Spotify isn't very good at auditing its own streams. As an example, Spotify will report higher streaming revenues for a particular song to the artist/songwriter than to the publisher. The numbers should be reversed in most cases because of cover versions. Spotify are doing something very wrong and only time will tell what the outcome is. I see and hear people defending Spotify much of the time. I just read a blog post this last week that explained how thoroughly wonderful the service is (to the user), and how artists should stop complaining and place the blame on the record labels. The problem with this \"argument\" is that the Big Four are basically in bed with Spotify. In order to gain unfettered access to content, Daniel Ek and Shaun Parker secured royalty deals with each and every one of the majors. Profit-sharing is a part of those deals, and that's what makes Spotify shady. The \"best\" businesses are always the ones that get paid more than once. How the music industry has been playing that game for years is beyond the current question. Being a working musician has never been an easy prospect. Even the few that do make it struggle to gain and keep relevancy. The lucky few that do make any kind of splash may eventually pass into cult status and become a so-called \"long-tail\" prospect. Labels don't particularly like long-tail product, and music is more of a business for them than it's ever been. They'd actually prefer everything to be manufactured and fake, and profitable, than to contain any kind of artistry and be undersold. My worry is that some of the best music will never be heard or even ceased because potential artists will simply give up. So, while streaming hasn't ruined the music industry (yet), it still has plenty of potential to do some real harm. And, to close, it's not the streaming itself that is the problem. If people are okay with listening to down-sampled, lower quality versions of their favorite music, that's great. What needs to change are the royalty payment rates. ",

            "answer_text": "As a kid, nearly all my spending money went to music cassette tapes, and later, CDs; most of my buying decisions had to do with agonizing over which albums to buy first. If I went back in time and told 15-year-old me that one day I'd be able to listen to millions of artists from around the world with the press of a button, for less than the cost a single CD every month, 15-year-old me would have hailed it as a miracle. Think about it in terms of the history of human music, and it is a miracle! But you wouldn't know it from the twin Chicken Littles crowing otherwise -- the music critics, and the major record labels. According to the labels, consumers have been ruining the music industry for decades. Remember how cassette recorders ruined music in the 80s? No? That's because they didn't. Having learned nothing from that, or from Napster, or even from friggin' iTunes, major record labels continue to kick and cry and scream that life is so unfair to them; they still even hide behind the idea that consumers are stealing honest money from artists' pockets, as if the labels wouldn't know anything about that themselves. The labels' message hasn't changed since 1984: we have the right to dictate to consumers how they should and will consume music, because consumers are a bunch of selfish thieves who want everything for free. Actually, they aren't. I'll leave the detailed explanation to Lars Doucet, who uses video games and ad-blocking software as examples here (and here, and here), but the principle is the same: Participating in a market doesn't just involve money -- it also involves time, inconvenience, and one's perception of one's own integrity. Consumers will go for the option that involves the least total cost. I'm not here to say that file sharing isn't stealing, but I do want to point out that the music industry had years to come up with a constructive and money-making response to changing markets. Instead of observing that consumption patterns were shifting and figuring out how to monetize it to their advantage, they tried to tell people that what they wanted was wrong, they were wrong to want it, and they needed to stop wanting that and go back to wanting the thing they used to buy. To drive home the point, they whined and threatened and took out sternly-worded ads in college newspapers and sued grandmas and homeless people. In the meantime, their revenues continued plummeting, and less myopic and inflexible companies eventually moved in to eat their lunch. Hence why we all subscribe to iTunes and Spotify instead of Universal or Sony. The labels have one reason why music consumers are bad and wrong, but music critics have another -- they complain that streaming has trapped us all in a never-ending cycle in which streaming inherently devalues music, and then consumers value music less because we can stream it. Because we stream, we consume more than we could ever possibly understand or appreciate. Because we stream, we only look for artists who are similar to artists we already like. Because we stream, we no longer have any loyalty to artists, and we won't seek them out if they're not on streaming services. Because we stream, major record labels will only support artists with the broadest possible appeal -- and now artists will never be able to make money on being musicians ever again. In regards to the financial argument for artists, I only have two words (no, not those two words): Wake up. Major record labels have never existed to promote music for its own sake. (Or was Billy Joel a visionary decades before his time when he sang \"The Entertainer\" in 1974?) And streaming didn't deal the crippling blow to artists' revenues, or companies' risk tolerance -- that was done years ago, when a handful of umbrella companies took over the huge majority of consumer media. The infographic is now a bit outdated, but the point still stands. Blaming streaming music for the effects of widespread market capitalization is practically non sequitur. It was already unlikely for anyone to make a living off music, or off music alone, if they weren't a molded industry star. That it's now even less likely, apart from the occasional viral jackpot winner, is sad. But it's no different from where most other forms of art have been for years. (Whether that's sad is the topic of another article.) Meanwhile, the \"quality\" arguments -- that streaming makes us \"worse\" consumers of music -- are simply a confusion between access and capacity, sprinkled with a bit of arrogant cultural gatekeeping. When you only had FM radio and a few dozen CDs to inform your musical world, it was only natural that you'd only have a handful of favorite bands and genres. Now, when we're only a few clicks away from almost every kind of music known to humankind, we can have the whole universe of music to love. In the meantime, nothing about streaming keeps you from loving or being loyal to your favorite artists. Nor does it prevent you from making connections with other people over favorite artists -- and now, if someone tips you off to a new artist, you can access (and potentially fall in love with) the artist's whole catalog instantly, instead of having to decide whether they're worth the opportunity cost of time and effort required to seek them out. If we believe that selection and ease of acquisition degrade one's degree of personal appreciation or involvement with music, then we must also say that going to a library makes you a person with a poor appreciation of books and authors. Finally, while the \"mainstream\" may never again support any artists that aren't \"vanilla\" (and again I argue, that's already been the M.O. for decades, and it's nonsense to blame streaming for it now), the diversion to streaming has the potential to expose people to artists they never would have found otherwise. Even a perfectly enlightened traditional music industry, concerned only with artistic value and merit, would have a limited capacity -- record labels, the radio, and the music press would still necessarily have to pick and choose who they promote. But streaming services overtly recognize that it's in their interest to keep exposing you to new music. While they're hardly averse to big promotions of artists supported by the major labels, all of the major streaming services make it effortless to browse their catalogs and find even more music, be it via direct search, curated playlists, social sharing, or even simple algorithmic recommendations based on aggregate data. For the consumer, the cost of experimentation in time, money, and effort is now almost nothing. How could this not be a gift to the industry as a whole? Streaming music is the natural outgrowth of recent technological and business innovations combining with consumer habits that had already been in place for years. It is simultaneously cause, effect, and emblem of enormous changes in the music industry -- but it's nonsense to say that it \"ruined\" the music industry. People still make music, sell music, buy music, and value music; they simply don't do it in the same ways they did 10 years ago. And, frankly, if ruining the music industry means ruining the profit models of enormous businesses that were already calcified and corrupt, and the social capital of gatekeepers who feel they have the right to dictate how and why people should consume media, then let me grab my fiddle so I can play while they burn. And by that, I mean let me stream Black Violin, an artist I discovered through Pandora and grew to love through Spotify. They are much better at fiddle-playing than I am. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d rather say the major record companies have been ruining the music industry for a while, and streaming is just one of the many leverages they use to bury themselves alive. But let me elaborate... First of all, the music industry is not just Universal, Sony and Warner. It\u2019s also thousands of independent artists, record labels, audio engineers, street performers and all the other folks who are trying to make money with music. While most of them may not make decent amount, some still get something. And those people, who are actually the majority in the music space (not in terms of profit but the number of heads), don\u2019t really get hurt at all. On the contrary, the new technology has given them the opportunity to get discovered, attract new fans, and eventually get paid. Lots of indies increased their income from literally zero to something through digital sales, online merch, royalties and donations. Those whose fan base was friends and family few years ago, now may have hundreds or thousands followers across the globe, just thanks to the digital era, and streaming (as a discovery means) plays maybe the most significant part in it. The news always tells us how badly online music services hurt poor artists and how little money they pay, but they never tell how big that overall positive impact on the industry those services are actually making. All that whining about \"being underpaid\" typically comes from the major record and distribution labels mentioned above and the main reason is that they still don\u2019t seem to be able (and don\u2019t seem to want for some reason) to change and adapt their business model, which has been broken for couple of decades already, to the contemporary technology. They are used to sell music records essentially as vegetables at a grocery store. You come to a place, select a tomato (= cassette or CD), pay for it, go home and eat it (= listen to it till you get bored, it gets scratched, broken, etc. - you din\u2019t actually know, by the way, what the lifetime of that purchased item would be, in fact). Approximately the same way it works now in online music stores (better though as it\u2019s not that easy to \"scratch\" a digital record compared to a cassette or CD). Which is fine. When the music streaming came into play, instead of learning and coming up with different ways to make money, they just decided that the same tomato-like sales were going to work there as well, and came up with DMCA, streaming royalties, etc. (which are basically same \"get money for selling a tomato\" thing). However, if you think about all this more thoroughly, you might see how ridiculous all that is. Should a grocery owner pay royalties per each customer to farmers because people come to a store and look at, touch and sniff vegetables? But I bet those farmers may have put much more effort and time into growing their produce. When people come to a painting gallery to look at the pictures, should the owner of the place pay royalties to the artists per number of visitors because they enjoyed the art (or for the number of photos taken)?. When a person writes an article in her blog, creates a post on Facebook, uploads a video on YouTube, should she expect receiving royalties from hosting providers, Facebook, Google, etc. for the number of people who visited the webpage online and read/watched the content she had created? Should I receive royalties for writing this comment from Quora per each reader just because it\u2019s \"distributed\" and might be \"used\" (read/quoted/copied) by other folks? Should a busker who performs in the streets charge the local council per number of people who incidentally happened to cross the street while he was performing? If they shouldn\u2019t, why is it different with music recordings/streaming? Those are same kind of products brought in by people\u2019s creativity and their huge effort. Writing articles, recording videos, drawing and painting pictures, performing in the streets, growing crops - all those activities create content/product (text, visual, physical, etc.) but no one seems to even think about introducing royalties for those, however. So, getting back to streaming, royalties and online music services\u2019 evil hurting poor artists... It\u2019s not the streaming bad but the unnatural approach that the music industry majors have chosen trying to survive in the contemporary technological world (which is a long term failure anyway). They do get hurt (actually, they hurt themselves). But not the music industry overall (the news usually covers only the very narrow and not necessarily correct perspective). More than that, streaming is the future. People care less and less about their offline music libraries, downloads, etc. The \"music industry\" can try to prevent it, they can try to continue whinging and spreading misleading information, but if they don\u2019t accept and adapt changes, they are out of the business in the long run, I believe. You can\u2019t stop downloads or streaming now - you shut down one service, there will be fifty new online tomorrow. The industry has changed and it keeps changing. And I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s for the better. ",

            "answer_text": "It hasn't ruined music. If anything, this is a golden age for music fans. All that sentimental stuff about the way we used to buy recorded music contains a lot of bunk. \"Boo hoo. Home taping of LPs to cassettes is ruining the music industry. Hopefully, these long-awaited new over-budget sub-par albums from Led Zeppelin and the Eagles will save the industry.\" I distinctly remember hearing these storylines way back in 1979. I think the price of an LP went up around that time, too. So don't believe it if somebody tries to tell you that the industry and the consumer were always buddies. I never got into illegally downloading music. I wasn't virulently for it or against it, I just didn't take to it. Since I had already forked over a lot of money over the years for recorded music, I felt a bit of schadenfreude about it. But managing audio files struck me as intensely boring - it was too much like being a system administrator. Also, the differences in sound quality among files generally don't matter to me (especially if it's rock music) or can't be discerned without superexpensive audio gear. So when streaming came along, I warmed up to it pretty fast. I'm a classical snob, but I figured out that I can find obscure classical stuff within Spotify with some adroit searching. I spent a significant amount of time searching out obscure classical stuff that I had already bought and paid for on CD anyway. I haven't given up on paying for recordings. I can't get too excited about the vinyl renaissance, and as I said I dislike audio files (did I mention that iTunes is crummy software?) But we have CD players in our cars and that works fine. Or you can buy a CD and get the audio files as well. Getting back to the question: Has streaming music ruined the music industry? No, it hasn't. The music industry just has to work harder to find ways to stay relevant. To me, that means live music, TV appearances, and various outside-the-box approaches like paying Molly Hatchet to play at your fifty-fifth birthday party or watching the Metropolitan Opera at your local movie theater. Big music industry stars are as prominent as ever. Everyone has an opinion about Adele and Taylor Swift. Beyonce recently raised eyebrows with her appearance at one of our institutionalized music industry spectacles, the Super Bowl halftime show. ",

Streaming has single handedly destroyed, and reinvigorated the music industry over a very long and unforgiving two decades. Here\u2019s a great list of current and deceased streaming platforms. [1] There are a few massive shifts in the industry, streaming companies have played a large role in bringing to fruition.. Artists can compete on a global level - Now, one could argue that the internet is the reason why this exists, but the reality is, the internet provided the infrastructure for streaming services to build upon. After the fall of CDs, and the rise of social platforms such as (Myspace, Facebook) and hosting sites such as (Soundcloud, Youtube, Reverbnation, Purevolume, etc) the market no longer requires $1 million record deals, for musicians to become successful, or to have a fair shot.. With the rise of streaming services, if musicians understand how to navigate APIs and marketing insight, the data that\u2019s available now on who\u2019s listening to what, where, how and when? is information that every musician should learn how to leverage.Devaluation of single tracks - Royalties are currently under a lot of scrutiny.. Here\u2019s a little insight into just how awful it can be..\u201cIn our report published last year, Digital Music News found that Napster had the highest payouts.

The guilt layed upon teenagers who could finally listen to what THEY want, and not the crap that was fed to them, with the outdated, greedy model made me feel justified, but there was a nagging sense of \u2018Am I stealing?\u2019 I quickly put that to bed the more I looked into how the model \u2018worked\u2019 and realised these snakes don't care about the artists or the consumer. And in the long run the artists got the short end of the stick if they didn't fit into the pocket the record companies wanted. These dinosaurs fought and fought, and didn't adapt. Like the dinosaurs they are now extinct, and good riddance. I now pay for Spotify and couldn't be happier. It may not be the perfect financial model for every artist, but it's a level playing field (for now). I listen to 100s of more bands that I'd never heard of and I'm grateful. I see more live music because some of these bands I'd never heard of play locally. I pay money to see them, and perhaps pick up the odd vinyl, bit of merch to support them. I buy beer at the pub, and meet some great people. I live in one of the best cities in the world for original live music (Melbourne). And if you can bothered switching the dial away from the shitty commercial stations and actually get out you will see there are more bands than ever, and there is some seriously talented and awesome guys and girls out there.

It often happens (happened) when we are young, and at a time when our senses are at their keenest. Streaming disassociates music from environment. In principle music has become universal. Available anywhere, at any time. This directly undermines the process of identification. All senses but our hearing are rendered irrelevant. Identification with cultural values, sights and sounds, interactions with people: all irrelevant. The next step in the cultural armageddon is \u2018generative music\u2019, where even the element of choice is eclipsed. Instead of exposure to new acoustic adventures, we get to hear endless variations on the little music we have managed to internalize and \u2018like\u2019. That, my friend, is the end of music as consumer good. Commoditized. Near to \u2018throw-away\u2019 value. Ultimately irrelevant. ",

Anybody you know or in your family who was named as a classic man. Streaming music reduces our work of downloading I agree that but whether we download or stream it we loses those little moments and beautiful memories which CD's have given us. but streaming music doesn't ruined music industry because streaming music is just showing that original music . it is just a tool on which we can listen to original music . It is null connected to music industry . Streaming means without downloading watching your favourite videos and music industry is people who are giving us content of listening nice, warming and breathtaking songs . just thought if it ruins then why these apps are making more and streaming more?? It will be weird to say that it ruined industry because those people themselves are promoting those streaming apps and put their songs to listen . hahaha Actually now every person in the corner of the world is attached to music industry by these streaming apps . just think about it and you will get your answer https://huntsends.com/music-streaming-apps ",

It has forced the industry as a whole to come up with new ideas or be left behind in the dust. Streaming has plenty of benefits, the music industry just has to use it to their advantage. Like any business, innovation is key to keeping a business profitable and making sure you're moving forward in modernization projects etc. The industry is now actually using streaming to its advantage by collecting royalties for every time a song is played or listened to on a legitimate streaming service. The payout per song is very small (something like a fraction of a cent per play) but play that song a couple thousand or million times and the royalties turn out to be pretty good. I believe, because of also the drop in purchasing of songs and albums the industry has tended to focus more on live events and getting the artists out into the public to make money. Some big ticket artists will rake in a couple million dollars in just one night of performance. ",

However in conjunction with TV programmes like Got Talent, Idol and The Voice it has changed the fabric of the industry for the major players which unfortunately filters down and affects all of the players. By the way this only my opinion and may be total rubbish. Firstly I believe that the users of streamed music do not feel the same way as purchasers of physical music. Streaming is instant, played in the background and reasonably disposable. A radio station without the DJ or commercials. I sure that a lot of music does not even register, I have conversations and when I mention an artist they look blank, you then play part of the track and it registers. They know the song but not its name or the artist. Secondly we\u2019re all aware that streaming accounts for 70\u201380% of sales but the income derived is considerably less, a fraction. Why would you pay good money for innovative music with costly production when most of the market is happy with music that sounds the same. Hell you could record one rhythm track, use the same background music and just change the lead instruments and the lyrics, and get away with it. Maybe they do ",

With concert tickets ranging from $100-$200 and thousands upon thousands of fans waiting for their chance to one day see their favorite act once, twice, three or four times, their is still a huge amount of money in the music industry. Only the revenue streams have shifted a little. Most of the money now comes from touring and merchandise, as even digital sales are way down, and streams don\u2019t bring much in terms of revenue. But what you can do is sell a $5 shirt for $50. Fans go crazy for that stuff. Maybe you combine the two and sell the artists merchandise before and after their concert. Same customer, double the money! Most new artists that get signed to a major label get in a 360-deal, where the label takes a cut of EVERYTHING. TV appearences, private bookings, commercials, everything that has to do with the artists name. So trust me, the music industry isn\u2019t going anywhere.

            "answer_text": "No - the global music industry, including the recorded music business, is growing consistently over the last few years. Keep in mind \u2018music industry\u2019 includes more than just recorded music, so the real change is in revenue streams for artists. Artists make money from various streams - touring, merch, synch, privates, brand deals, etc. Recording is still a valuable source of revenue but it\u2019s not as large per artist and it\u2019s not as direct as a sales oriented business. Do some quick math: In 1999, the revenue peak of the \u2018sales\u2019 oriented music industry the average consumer in the US spent $30/year on recorded music and the top consumer spent an average of $60/year on recorded music. If streaming becomes ubiquitous the standard rate is $10/month or $120/year. So mathematically there\u2019s more money overall in the industry - the question is does that amount of money sustain the rights holders, the artists AND the tech companies generating the revenue. So far not a single streaming service is profitable (Spotify is getting close). So no\u2026 the streaming services are not currently collapsing the industry, but if the streaming services grow to become the sole source of revenue for the industry then fold themselves for lack of profitability, then the recorded music business COULD collapse. But collapse is also too catastrophic of a term - Spotify would go away or be purchased but Apple Music and YouTube would be fine thanks to global giant parent companies. ",

But streaming services don't offer content focused to a genre of listeners and people like to be told what to do as not, depending on what they are feeling in the day. So streaming just offers another method for listeners. It just hurts cause now the music industry cannot control the listeners and never will.  ",

Most people would just wear something and throw it away afterwards rather than even taking time to wash the clothes. Occasionally you will come across some favorites and will favor those to some extent, but when there are new clothes added literally every hour to the closet in a near endless supply, each piece of clothing simply becomes less valuable. I many ways, music has become like this. ",

Musician getting paid was bit more straightforward since you'd have physical or digital copy of the music. Streaming service changed the market by offering their preference and playlist for very affordable price. Musician getting paid has become almost non-existent since the industry has one more business entity to pay for the service - internet/service provider - and we are counting number of the track streamed, not actual copy that has been sold, which makes harder to track actual brand awareness of artists.

This trend was already prevalent due to innovations such as iTunes, but it\u2019s definitely increased now that people are discovering music through playlists moreso than through albums now. A more technical change is how tracks are getting mixed/mastered. Within the production industry, problems such as the \u201cloudness war\u201d have become non-existent due to the fact Spotify has algorithms that match the \u201cperceived loudness\u201d of each track. Before this, tracks would actually sound better due to the fact that some producers were just \u201csmashing their sound through a limiter\u201d to make the track sound \u201cbigger.\u201d ",

The music industry will only die once people decide they don\u2019t want to listen to music anymore. I\u2019m not worried that will ever happen. In the mean time, the industry will keep changing to provide the product people want the most efficient way. If a company does not change they will lose customers and vanish eventually, leaving the market more attractive to new business. Free markets are self regulatory. However, things have changed too quickly for most people it seems. The changes not only affect labels and distributors but musicians as well. The whole scheme of producing albums and singles makes little sense in a world where discs don\u2019t exist anymore. If I had to make a prediction I would use my experience with soundcloud. It\u2019s where I listen to music the most lately. It\u2019s a streaming service with music straight from the musicians. I\u2019m getting to know new artists there! And most don\u2019t release albums, they simply upload new music regularly and it lands on my time line. I think it\u2019s feasible to capitalize on this system; it could use ads, like most things online today, or it could have a subscription system (artist based or platform based). I don\u2019t think buying music individually is possible anymore though. ",
