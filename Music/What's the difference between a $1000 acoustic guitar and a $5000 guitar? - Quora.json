            "answer_text": "There are alot of answers that sway towards why you would not HAVE to spend $5000 on a guitar. Not as to why a guitar may cost $5000. We can start off by saying, it is absaloutley ok to walk into a store or guitar haven and fall in love with anyone of them, price not even considered. Listening to the highs and lows, the bass, etc of the guitar. Getting used to the feel of the guitar, finding something that works for you and your needs. It could be $500, it could be $3000. It could have a huge second hole in it where someone began installing a pick up system and gave up! However, why do some cost thousands? It's like anything. Consider, does it have kudos? Is it John Lennons old guitar? Is it from a \u201creally cool name and iconic company?\u201d Consider it's age. If it's used, hardwood, many people believe this age and sounds better, making the guitar sound better, right? 20 years old, 30 years old, plenty of time for that wood to get better at producing sounds? But a huge one, is going to be manufacturing. There are good guitars, there are good enough guitars, and then there are bad guitars. Take a budget guitar, its $300. It plays, it's a guitar. Why is it so cheap? Cheaper woods, more mass produced, and more than likely, less vigorous quality control. Maybe 1 in 50 have a wonky bridge? Maybe the glue in a spot will wear away in 5 years? Who cares, it was $300, its almost disposable. Now maybe your $5000 guitar has been built with stronger woods, better glue, and more rigorous quality control. Perhaps the bracing pattern inside the body is more suitable for the type of playing the guitar type is used for. Heck, it may even be hand built and had all the attention and care it will need. But that costs time, and time costs money. And then maybe, they used something fancy too, and are trying to sell you fancy ebony woods. Theres a fine line of what you need, and what you want. Brush up on materials and names, but it will always be hard to tell what you're getting, unless you work with the manufacturer. And as for checking reviews, hardly worth the time, they can easily be biased or misleading. ",

            "answer_text": "I happen to own one of these: https://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/814ce As you can see, it is not exactly $5000, but closer to that than to $1000. I have owned and played several instruments in the $1000 range too. What can I say? My Taylor 814CE is a mind-blowing instrument. The richness of resonance, the balance of the sound and the range of possible responses depending on your attack, everything is astonishing. It\u2019s also easy to play and very easy on the eyes, too. It\u2019s also versatile. Just change the pick or attack style, and you have yourself a different kind of tone. Funny thing, it isn\u2019t even a dreadnought, but that doesn\u2019t hinder it one bit. No $1000 instrument I\u2019ve owned or played has come close to this. What makes it good? I\u2019d say the tonewoods (spruce top, rosewood back and sides), bracing/quality control (Taylor hallmark), great pickup system. But really, this is an amazing instrument. Going back to the $1000 range, these instruments are excellent. But something in the richness of the tone, in the resonance\u2026 is not there. One side effect of playing such an instrument - it made me a better player over time. With a guitar less perfect, I could always write off imperfections in my sound as being the fault of the instrument. Not here. Anything short of stunning has to be my fault =))) That is the difference for me. I\u2019ve never owned or played an instrument worth $5000 or more. Could they be even better? Maybe, but they\u2019d have to try damn hard! ",
