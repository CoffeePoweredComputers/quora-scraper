            "answer_text": "Well considering it\u2019s in a fictional country, Florin, part of a fictionalised European continent, and has a fascinating but completely fantastical set-up of countries and fashions, it doesn\u2019t have an actual time period. However, that doesn\u2019t really answer the question, so let\u2019s look at the evidence, and climb the Cliffs of Insanity together: Vizzini tells us he\u2019s Sicilian, Inigo Montoya is Spanish, and Fezzik is Turkish but was \u201cunemployed in Greenland\u201d when Vizzini found him. Erik the Red found Greenland in about 982 (Erik the Red - the discovery of Greenland), so we\u2019re looking at some time after that. However, it\u2019s not likely that Fezzik got there that early. There was enough trade for Vizzini to get there and back, so he was possibly part of the expeditions from Portugal to Greenland in 1500 (Greenland) or part of the trading that occurred with Labrador after then. Inigo is fighting with a rapier not a broadsword, so it\u2019s probably after 1500. He\u2019s been fighting with it for more than 20 years, looking for the Six-Fingered-Man, who murdered Inigo\u2019s father. Inigo\u2019s father was an expert sword-maker, so the weapon had probably been around long enough for him to build a reputation, so I would put the events no earlier than 1530. Humperdinck is Prince of Florin and is attempting to frame Guilder. He\u2019s also still living in an actual castle with soldiers, portcullis, and torches, but there\u2019s no gunpowder, so while I would say pre-1300 if it was being used defensively, there\u2019s no evidence he\u2019s using the castle as anything other than a rather gorgeous house. This is Humperdinck in his castle, wearing his rather gorgeous blue outfit:  (Photo from IMDb) Which clearly has features in common with Bronzino\u2019s painting of a young nobleman:  (Wikimedia commons) That puts Humperdinck at around 1550\u20131555. Of course, he could also be behind or ahead of the fashion trend, but it\u2019s not a bad period for the Princess Bride to be set in. Another Bronzino:  (Wikimedia again) Which could be inspiration for Buttercup\u2019s red dress. Florin is clearly a replacement for Florence, one of the fractious states of Italy, while Guilder is probably the Netherlands. Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany was in charge at that point, and may be some inspiration for the character of Humperdinck. So, if you want to take the fashion, architecture, geographical trade routes, and sword-culture as a starting point, the late Renaissance seems about right, and at a guess between 1530 and 1560. Edit to add: With huge thanks to Nathan Sinclair who pointed out that Vizzini uses iocaine from Australia and \u201cUnfortunately, Australia was not \u201centirely peopled with criminals\u201d until after the British First Fleet arrived in 1788.\u201d So we\u2019re left with three possibilities: The period is in the deep future, after the fall of modernity.It is in fact as timeless as Westley\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts moniker.Or my favourite, in trusting Vizzini\u2019s word about both Greenland and Australia, I \u201cfell victim to one of the classic blunders - the most famous of which is \"never get involved in a land war in Asia\" - but only slightly less well-known is this: \"Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line\"!\u201d",

            "answer_text": "Well its fictional but we do have some clues from the movie. One of the things i love about the movie is that during the epic duel between Wesley and Inigo Montoya they reference certain fencing masters and the styles they had. Many are not aware of the fact that the names they used were actual famous historical fencing masters. Now the styles they were referencing were not even close but it was a nice touch to include the names. Camillo Agrippa fencing treatise published in 1553. Rocco Bonetti killed in a duel 1587. Capo ferro fencing treatise published in 1610. G\u00e9rard Thibault d'Anvers fencing treatise published in 1630 (3 years after his death in 1627).  ",
