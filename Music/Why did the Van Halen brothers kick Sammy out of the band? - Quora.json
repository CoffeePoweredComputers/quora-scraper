            "answer_text": "I can tell you exactly how it went down. Each side gave their own story. But I agree with the other answer on here in siding with Sammy on the truth. He\u2019s told the truth on the subject and never wavered. I have followed Van Halen their entire career, but especially during the early \u201890\u2019s when I was in my early 20\u2019s. I would get Guitar World and all the Musician magazines that had ANYTHING on Van Halen. I have also read Sammy\u2019s book \u201cRED\u201d which has a lot of details in it as well. I was an Eddie fanatic. Being a musician, he was my guitar hero. I was obsessed with the band. But basically you have to know the whole story. Sammy and Ed were best friends from the time he joined in \u201985. And the band all got along with no problems whatsoever from 5150, OU812, and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. During the Carnal Knowledge tour, Sammy\u2019s 1st marriage was ending, and it was a very long tour. Then they had done the double CD Live-Right Here, Right Now album. It was a long non stop several years and Hagar was burnt, so was Michael Anthony. But the VH brothers never liked taking time off. They would have just stayed on the road forever if it was up to them at the time. That\u2019s why Alex has been married like 4 times, and Ed\u2019s marriage to Valerie didn\u2019t last (along with him still smoking after he had been diagnosed with tongue cancer, which came years later). Sammy had brought his Manager- Ed Leffler to the band when he had joined. Never had any issues. But he died around \u201893-\u201994 when they were about to make the album Balance. The VH brothers had said we used your guy as a manager, now let\u2019s use our guy now-Ray Daniels (Alex\u2019s brother-in-law at the time). Hagar had also gotten remarried at this time to his 2nd wife Kari. Like with any band, after 10 years together, you are going to have conflict and friction. So Balance came out in \u201995 and they toured. They had ALL agreed to take a good long break when the tour ended. But Ed was asked if VH would do several songs for the \u201cTwister\u201d movie soundtrack by the Director Jan De Bont. So around \u201996 Ed wanted Sammy to fly to LA from Hawaii -even though Sammy\u2019s wife was pregnant, and about to give birth- to lay down vocals for these \u201cTwister\u201d songs at 5150 studios. Sammy was understandably mad telling Ed why are we even doing these handful of songs for this movie, especially when we ALL agreed to take time off after the last tour which had been a long one, and I don\u2019t want to leave my wife alone at our house in Hawaii with her about to give birth at any time. So there was a lot of friction over these recordings, with \u201cHumans Being\u201d being the sole song with vocals - the other was the instrumental \u201cChasing the Wind\u201d. At this time Sammy had been frustrated with Ed because Ed never questioned Sammy\u2019s lyrics in the songwriting process before, but all of a sudden he was very critical about the lyrics. Sammy said to the brothers, listen man I am going back to my wife, which he did, and soon after had his daughter. Then the 1st Greatest Hits album was in the works by the brothers. Sammy said back then that it should be a 2 disc set -one disc Roth, one Sammy (which years later around 2003\u201304 ended up coming true with the \u201cBest of Both Worlds\u201d 2 disc greatest hits set anyways, just that it was one song at a time with each different singer, and 3 new songs with Hagar on vocals), but they said no we want it to be one disc. Sammy was still frustrated because he DID NOT get along with the new manager Ray Daniels, and was upset that they wanted to do a G.Hits album when they were supposed to be taking a hiatus that the band had all agreed on! But on Fathers Day 1996, Ed called Sammy and basically said \u201cyou don\u2019t do anything I ask you to do, all we do is disagree, and we\u2019ve been working with Roth on some new songs for the G.Hits album, so why don\u2019t you just go back to being a solo artist, which is what you want anyway.\u201d Then you throw in the VH brothers jealousy of the success of the \u201cCabo Wabo\u201d nightclub and Hagar\u2019s Tequila company making him over $150 million, and you have why they broke up the FIRST time. Then Hagar rejoined for the 2004 reunion tour and the 3 new songs for the 2nd G.Hits package. But if you read the chapter from Hagar\u2019s book titled \u201cSamarai Hair\u201d, you will find out all the details of how they broke up the 2nd time, and probably the last time unfortunately. Eddie started drinking again, and was completely out of control. Now after having a third of his tongue removed because of cancer, and his cancer now coming back to his throat (although he STILL attributes this to putting a metal pick in his mouth, NOT smoking cigarettes every day of his life since he was 12 years old!), and Hagar being around 72 years old, I think the time has pretty much passed us by for a final reunion. There has been just TOO much stuff that has happened. Plus the way they took away almost all of Michael Anthony\u2019s share of the music publishing, and the fact that it\u2019s pretty much over with Roth-that ship has sailed- (plus his voice is just GONE now). And they have tried the 3rd lead singer route with Gary Cherone, and that didn\u2019t work out, so they won\u2019t be trying that again. Sadly this could be the end of VH. ",

            "answer_text": "The Van Halen brothers are talented AF. I mean, like world class, once in a generation, both of them. Of course, Eddie is the recognized Rock God / genius , but Alex, as he should be, in his heyday, was the best rock drummer on the planet (side note: if you ever get a chance to watch/LISTEN to EVH talk about how he tinkered with his guitar sound, from an equipment modification standpoint, guitar/amps/electrical/etc., when he was young, it\u2019s WORTH IT. He did an interview a few years ago on this, it was 100% fascinating, amazing, and insightful. I\u2019m probably not doing it justice, but he pretty much used just every day hardware/tools to disassemble, tinker with, modify, adjust, and reassemble just about everything from guitar and amps. Once he got a \u2018name\u2019, he worked with manufacturers to kind of do it right. Clear evidence of genius at work!). So that\u2019s the easy and positive part of the story. The hard part of the VH story is that the VH brothers are/have become incredibly difficult, mean spirited, now senior citizen age, spoiled rotten entitled cranks, professionally. Both Roth and Hagar are incredibly strong personalities, with planet sized egos, and vocal about opinions. The VH brothers are a rough crowd, they stick together no matter what, and they fight dirty. From an outsider looking in, they appear to be well versed in all of the hallmarks of dysfunction, which for those of us educated enough on this, know it is taught in one\u2019s youth. If either of them perceive a \u2018slight\u2019, the response is usually collaborative and underhanded (witness what they have public said about Michael Anthony in the last decade, it\u2019s incredibly slimy, also witness how they ghosted EVERYBODY at and before the VH hall of fame induction, classic signs of dysfunctional characteristics and intentions). Given the VH brothers general nasty personalities, and their banked money, they can be really tough on bombastic larger than life singers (in addition to incredibly nice ex-bassists!), which are the only type they\u2019ve ever employed, ironically. Also, given the VH brother\u2019s age and net worth, it\u2019s really hard to see a future project or concert with any 4 or 5 of the van halen members from the last 40 years. They don\u2019t need the hassle at this point and they would have to DIG DEEP to find a motivation to do it. In Dave\u2019s case, he can\u2019t sing anymore, and it\u2019s not even close (if you went to a local bar and hear him fronting a bar-band, you\u2019d made fun of his voice these days, it\u2019s awful). Additionally, the brothers can\u2019t stand his present \u201cact\u201d (Dave\u2019s moves and act on stage, combined with his diminished voice / aged physical appearance, can be difficult to watch). Most of what the band wrote, and what Dave sings and performs to, worked out well when they were 25 years old in the late 70\u2019s / early 80\u2019s, but it doesn\u2019t translate well to their current ages, and it ends up coming off as part parody, part buffoonish, and in Dave\u2019s specific case, borders or smashes head on in to creepy as he wiggles and gyrates while leering at 18 year old girls. I\u2019m certain the VH brothers feel the \u201cnot aged well\u201d act at times, it would be impossible not to if you see it for yourself, and they have admitted to as much in interviews in the last decade or two. If you want proof of the \u201cDave hasn\u2019t aged well\u201d theory, youtube the 1983 US Festival performance when Dave, and VH, were at their \u201cmightiest\u201d in front of hundreds of thousands of fans, then contrast that with any performance from their last tour a few years back. The contrast is incredibly sad and sobering. In Sammys\u2019 case, he can still flat out sing (the man has some pipes and age doesn\u2019t seem to have taken much of a toll!), but the brothers just don\u2019t like him anymore as a collaborator (there\u2019s theories and stories on that, but the end result is that about 15 years ago, they just split and broke). The \u201cpost-Dave\u201d Sammy stuff the band did probably translates slightly better than the \u201cDave stuff\u201d, to current times and ages, it\u2019s not quite as creepy and inappropriate for their ages. Throw in EVH\u2019s potentially difficult health issues (but, again, he has ghosted the world on that!), and the end result is VH with either of the singers is done, and we should just enjoy the archives, as they made some of the best bone-crunching rock n roll ever! Everybody, including rock gods from our youth, gets old. VH is no different. I appreciate what they did as artists and the vast majority of it still sounds awesome! ",
