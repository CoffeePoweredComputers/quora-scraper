The first albums mixed only in Stereo and not Mono were Beggars Banquet and Abbey Road, funnily enough, the releases of Banquet and Let it Bleed and Yellow Submarine were actually mixed down to a reprocessed mono.

            "answer_text": "i am not an expert on stereo/mono questions regarding the Stones, but i can answer on the Beatles: The Beatles, as a band, recorded and mixed all their albums in mono until their final two LPs, Abbey Road & Let It Be. George Martin, their producer, was tasked with creating stereo mixes of their albums without the band\u2019s input. All the Beatles\u2019 albums were released in stereo the same week as the monos, mainly in North America. I would imagine The Rolling Stones also did the same. ",
