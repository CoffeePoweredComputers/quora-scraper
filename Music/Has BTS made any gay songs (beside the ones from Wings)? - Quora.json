            "answer_text": "I think you can interpret any song in whatever way you feel. Everyone has different thoughts or feelings when listening to music, because everyone has different life experiences or personal connectors to the music they hear. Although \u201cgay\" songs may or may not be what BTS is trying to convey, you are allowed to take it as what you want. If a certain song means something to you because you may perceive it as homosexual, but is meaningful to someone else because they think it's heterosexual, then the music is doing its job: evoking personal emotions that allow you to feel understandable and understood. I hope my answer gave you some insight :)) ",
