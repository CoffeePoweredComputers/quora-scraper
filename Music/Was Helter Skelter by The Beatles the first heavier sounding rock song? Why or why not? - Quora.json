            "answer_text": "Not even close. Hendrix, Cream, and others pre-dated The White Album. Helter Skelter\u2019s actually fairly pathetic compared with how \u201cheavy\u201d other bands were carrying on. There was this Beatle song that pre-dated Hendrix and Cream. It was just their third (consecutive) #1 hit in the US. It\u2019s kind of like a Phil Spector \u201cwall of sound\u201d thing except John Lennon thought hmmmm. Wall of guitars? The racket they got out of those big Vox amps must have been ungodly. Add Ringo pounding a decidedly heavy beat and you had one of the key proto-heavy rock songs. It\u2019s hard to find the original single online \u2014 you should have heard this blasting out of your mom\u2019s car radio. It was like an eruption. From April, 1965 . . . turn it up!  ",

            "answer_text": "No. There were bands recording heavy rock songs in 1964 when The Beatles were recording songs like \u201cLove Me Do.\u201d The Kinks released \u201cYou Really Got Me\u201d & \u201cAll Day & All Of The Night\u201d in 1964. The Yardbirds had debuted the year before. The Who were already active then also. \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d was recorded in an attempt to out heavy The Who on \u201cI Can See For Miles.\u201d They didn\u2019t succeed. \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d is one of the most tuneless songs in The Beatles catalogue. The Beatles recorded a lot of great melodic pop & rock music, but heavy rock music? Not so much. \u201cRain\u201d was probably the most interesting heavier rock tune they recorded. ",
