            "answer_text": "It was largely a teenage movement, but involves all age groups. Most influential metal bands were formed when members were teenagers, though some slightly younger or slightly older members comprise notable exceptions. It has been a lot less common for people in their 30\u2019s and later to start making metal for the first time in their lives, particularly if they have no background in rock music music whatsoever. That happens sometimes, but almost all of the formative and touchstone metalbands have been products of youth. But, one is only a teenager for less than a decade and many influential bands continued to be central or even trendsetting despite their members passing out of their teens. There are also cultural elements and logistical elements which tend to skew metal, in its emerging manifestations, towards young people rather than adults. However, this is not somehow representative of the fanbase of metal, or characterizing the range of general participants. It also does not comment on the continuation of pre-established paradigms. For many, metal is something which starts early\u2014childhood or adolescence, and then continues throughout their lives. Importantly, many of the prominent bands in the late 70\u2019s and the 80\u2019s have either continued or have reformed, both for touring and releasing new material. It is true that some only get into metal later in life, and that has also been the case since the very beginning\u2014even in the early scenes, there were people older or much older than the members of many of the bands who were playing locally, touring, or putting out critically acclaimed or genre-defining albums. Some people don\u2019t \u2018discover\u2019 metal til later on, others move into it from related or unrelated genres or scenes. There are also some people, albeit fewer, that appreciate metal or aspects of the metal scene in their teenage years but do not find that appreciation following them the rest of their lives. So, from the beginning, metal has never been exclusive to youths, whether in the playing, recording, releasing, documenting, or supporting of the music. It is also relevant to mention that it is not \u201cjust a trend\u201d\u2014we are talking about a genre that has been going strong for a good half-century now. Metal is no longer among the most popular genres in the mainstream, but it is a mainstream genre (even many of the more extreme subgenres have a robust aboveground following). If you go to some shows and talk to showgoers or bandmembers about their history with metal, you can find out just how far metal actually is from \u201cjust a teenage trend\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it surely is aimed at teenage angst and anger. If you grow older, grow some responsibilities, start to see the world a bit more differently than when you were 12, metal all of a sudden does not make sense anymore. Besides, metal is as fake as country or every other genre out there. If you see how old men still have to enter the stage and pretend that this is what they want to do - performing embarrassingly bad, then you ask yourself if their parents were right after all when they said \u201clearn something in life before you become a rockstar. your fifteen minutes of fame and your pretty face will not last forever\u201d. and here they are. old men playing their angry metal they played when they were in their 20s, this is the epitome of desperation and fake. just to pay the bills. I am 47 now and i still love to put some early Slayer, Maiden or similar stuff into my playlist. But overall i am not spending any money on metal stuff anymore. And i can\u2019t look up to them anymore. Because what they are trapped in is as pathetic as the life they tried to escape back in the day. ",
