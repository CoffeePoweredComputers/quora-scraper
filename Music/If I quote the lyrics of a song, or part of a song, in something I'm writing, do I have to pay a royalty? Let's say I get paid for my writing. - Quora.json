            "answer_text": "Quoting lyrics? It's a can of worms... All lyrics - published or not, are protected by copyright - you most definitely need permission from the rights holder to quote, even in a social media post, whether you are paid for your writing or not. Short quotes of lyrics aren't protected by Fair Use doctrine.  Image: It's a can of worms... Copyright owners, songwriters and publishers of lyrics are some of the most highly organised, aggressively proactive protectors of their rights in the creative realm. Getting permission to use lyrics means tracking down the publishing rights holder and negotiating a fee. Potential consequences can range from a DMCA takedown notice plus deindexing in search engines for digital media; to infringement, damages and compensation claims in courts with jurisdiction over Intellectual Property Law, digital and print media. ASCAP, the 500,000+ strong member org which maintains rights and licensing  to 8,500,000+ songs, doesn't license the rights to use quotes or copies of lyrics.  Some of the most comprehensive specialist sources for tracking down lyrics' publishing rights holders are: ASCAP:  American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers;BMI:      Broadcast Music, Inc.;HFA:      Harry Fox Agency;SESAC:  Society of European Stage Authors and Composers.Licensing fees for quotes can vary from free, to two, even four figures depending on how famous the song is, who you are and how you intend to use the lyric. An easier option may be to quote lyrics from songs in the public domain - songs generally, but not always published before 1922.  There's an apocryphal tale that when Stephen King submitted his manuscript for \"Christine\" he was completely committed to each chapter being headed by a two line, rock 'n' roll lyric. With all the clout that came with King's reputation, the publisher, Viking Press was still unable to gain licenses for some of the quotes originally chosen. For all these reasons, most publishers won't touch quoted lyrics with a ten foot pole. \"Here be dragons...\" Nope, nope, nope. It's a potential nightmare. Don't do it.  ",
