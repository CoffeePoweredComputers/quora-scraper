            "answer_text": "Alright. Here are some great verses. Meat Grinder: Madvillain. The song is just one really long ridiculous tongue twisting 2 minute verse that packs a ferocious punch. Great track. DOOM\u2019s style is downright vicious, and Madlib\u2019s beats are perfect. Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse on Monster: Kanye ft Rick Ross, Jay Z, Nicki Minaj, Bon Iver. The song has some ridiculous verses from Kanye, Rick Ross, and Jay Z. This pales in comparison, however, to the complete maniacal ripping to shreds of the lines Nicki Minaj (of all people) drops. Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse is considered one of THE best verses on a hip hop track, EVER. That\u2019s saying something. The first verse on m.A.A.d city: Kendrick Lamar. Kendrick Lamar gives his best verse ever on this MC Eiht featuring title track from his breakout album, Good Kid m.A.A.d City. It\u2019s angry, vicious, almost unrelenting in it\u2019s grim storytelling. It\u2019s a dark tale about his life in Compton, and delivery is near perfect. Q-Tip\u2019s verse on Scenario: A Tribe Called Quest ft Native Tongues. Tip\u2019s verse is short, but it\u2019s an incredibly smooth delivery with clever wordplay and cheeky attitude, it\u2019s one of the smoothest verses ever. Not just that, it\u2019s actually just a set up verse for Busta Rhymes of Native Tongues, but it steals the show. That\u2019s just 4, but if you look on Complex | Making Culture Pop and search up best verses, you\u2019ll find some stuff. ",
