            "answer_text": "A song can be \u201chappy\u201d in many ways, so I've chosen five that personally make me happy for various reasons. (I've stuck with the albums featuring the original line up, so no Full Circle and Other Voices, also didn't consider the other albums with live readings and stuff that is closer to poems than songs.) Anyways, these are five of the happiest Doors songs in my opinion: Wintertime Love. I just LOVE this one. The lyrics are pretty wholesome for the Doors, it has a great tune and vibe. Ah, it's just so cute. Nothing to do with her sister \u201cSummer's almost gone\", that one is pure doom. Also, it's pretty hard for a song that says \u201cla la la la\u201d to not be happy.Roadhouse Blues. This one is just a banger. Maybe \u201cuplifting\u201d is a better way to describe it rather than \u201chappy\u201d, but it's no wonder that it is so popular. After that first \u201cwell keep your eyes on the road your hands upon the wheeaaal\u201d it's just really hard to not be happy. Sure, as with pretty much all Doors songs the lyrics aren't all happy, \u201cthe future\u2019s uncertain and the end is always near\", but I see it more as a \u201clet's enjoy this while it lasts even if it is not perfect\u201d kind of thing. All of Morrison Hotel has a bit of that hard rock vibe we all love.Love street. Maybe the happiest Doors song for me if I had to choose. The music is so chill and calming and with the lyrics it just takes you somewhere else, a happy and cozy place where everything is alright. Seriously, this one gets me all warm inside.Spanish Caravan. Ok, I may be biased here because I am Spanish, but this one is great. That guitar intro and that calm vibe. And the lyrics \u201ccarry me caravan take me away, take me to Portugal take me to Spain\u2026\u201d, as Love Street this song takes me somewhere happy, but in Love Street it is a comfy sheltered place, while in this one it's a journey, searching for comfort in places you don't know but feel nostalgic about, (yeah call it wanderlust or whatever), wandering through life and enjoying the moment. It's just beautiful.Love me Two Times. Certainly the happiest song in Strange Days, and one of the happiest in general. No wonder this is another one of their greatest hits, sometimes a catchy classic rock love song is all you need to lift that spirit up.Of course these are just my interpretations of the songs, they could be awfully sad for other people, that's just how I like to see them. Give them a listen right now, you may discover some new songs or rediscover some old favorites. I've noticed three out of five songs are from Waiting for the Sun, so I guess that is the happiest album for me. Of course I left a lot out, but the Doors has songs for every feeling and mood even if some people thing most of their songs are on the depressing side, one of the greatest bands of all time. ",

            "answer_text": "Happy songs? Thing is, Ray Manzarek\u2019s organ playing always sounded like a carnival to me - even when their lyrics went the other way. \u201cLight My Fire\u201d\u2026 \u201cRoadhouse Blues\u201d\u2026 \u201cHello I Love You\u201d\u2026 \u201cTouch Me\u201d\u2026 \u201cLove Me Two Times\u201d (On second thought, I might walk this one back since I\u2019ve reminded myself it\u2019s about a soldier going off to Vietnam)\u2026 Maybe their tribute to Otis Redding \u201cRunnin Blue\u201d\u2026 Some seem happy except for a twist. \u201cMoonlight Drive\u201d almost made this list except I remember the closing lines as the song fades away \u201cGet real close\u2026 get real tight\u2026 Baby gonna drown tonight going down down down\u2026\u201d Whoa. Or \u201cLove Street\u201d which sounds happy until he has the spoken passage in the middle and says \u201cI guess I like it fine\u201d. And then throws in a \u201cSo far\u201d which makes it sound like less of a love song then you\u2019d think. I suppose if I thought harder, I might re-do this list. ",
