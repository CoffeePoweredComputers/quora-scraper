            "answer_text": "On a very small military site, in a very secluded part of the world, where the military wasn\u2019t ever actually located, there was a big metal hooch brought in and it was phenomenal!! Because they decided to make it the head\u2026 sooooo exciting! Like seriously game changing\u2026 NO more G.I. Showers\u2026 or so we thought\u2026 but THEN They put in \u201cghetto sinks\u201d, metal mirrors (like we were prisoners) and then they thought (I\u2019m guessing) \u201cwell shit how are the 43 men and 3 women gonna use this same head\u2026 we should use a TARP!\u201d And they NO SHIT put two blue tarps, bungee corded, up across the middle and these rinky dink shower heads stuck down on each side of the tarp. They might as well have just put like six green hoses on their side and three on our side\u2026 The THEORY was the men will shower and the women will shower and there won\u2019t be any problems BUT IT WAS A TARP, A TARP LIKE YOU WOULD PUT ON YOUR LEAKY ROOF\u2026. Anybody seeing where this might become a problem because the military thought that they were brilliant!!! Sooo when a woman would shower ALL the men on site off duty grabbed their shit and hauled ass to the hooch\u2026 and it was VERY common that if you (the woman on your side) dropped anything when you bent over to pick it up you would run into a man\u2019s body(parts?) showering on their side of the damn TARP!!! IF all three women showered on the same day, some men would shower repeatedly.. but the most magical part of the tarp was that IT WAS A FREAKIN TARP\u2026 It was equivalent to putting paper between personnel, it was useless and you heard EVERYTHING on the BOTH sides because\u2026 it was a TARP!!! Sometimes the guys would literally cat call us and I remember saying \u201cit\u2019s a TARP\u201d I KNOW who you are asshole\u2026\u201d other times they would literally try and have full on conversations with you or they\u2019d run their asses into you from their side of the tarp and go \u201coops sorry\u201d and then giggle or CHEER if their ass bump caused you to drop something\u2026 because the men would run in there on their \u201cside\u201d the water pressure was NONEXISTENT\u2026 one woman would get hot water two men would get burned, two more men would get ice water and one sucker got no water and then it would reverse the woman got no water, two men that had hot water were now under ice water, and the two under ice water were getting burned from the water. I remember like five or six guys running towards the hooch behind me and turning around and saying \u201csorry guys just brushing my teeth\u201d but they\u2019d still go in on their side of the tarp just to \u201cmake sure\u201d you weren\u2019t trying to trick them\u2026 I am not sure that anyone who hasn\u2019t seen first hand the absolute intelligence the military displays sometimes, you cannot understand how stupid and ridiculous and hysterical this was\u2026 they probably spent 100k on that damn hooch\u2026 but we loved it and we used it and we got our asses bumped, cat called, hit on\u2026 I mean men PLEASE please hit on me in the hooch on the other side of the tarp- omg a woman\u2019s dream come true!!! And within about 6\u201310 weeks the tarps started getting little holes\u2026 yeah GREAT IDEA\u2026 job well done! We\u2019d have been more efficient IF they\u2019d just taken the thing down and all showered together BC that\u2019s what we were doing or gave us different hours for showering but those ideas would\u2019ve stunted the military\u2019s creativity! And the BEST part? We had separate, actual, official thick heavy metal doors/entrances on each side of the tarp\u2026\u2026 To date whenever I see a big blue tarp I break into hysterical laugh! A damn tarp\u2026 omg ",

            "answer_text": "Well, they weren\u2019t truly \u201cCo-Ed\u201d, but the first week I was stationed in Germany, I was living in the dorm. I had just arrived from basic training and tech school, and men and women had always been segregated in the dorms, and in fact, getting caught in the wrong sex dorm and significant consequences. So, I assumed the dorm was a male dorm and there was one bathroom on our floor with 2 showers. One of the first mornings I was there, I got my shaving kit together walked in to the communal bathroom to see a beautiful blonde, brushing her teeth at the sink. She was wearing a white tee shirt that didn\u2019t quite cover her panties. I was 18 and pretty shy, and probably turn 10 different shades of red as a stuttered an apology thinking I had walked into the women\u2019s room. As I started to retreat, she rinsed her mouth and in a strong German accent said, \u201cIt\u2019s ok, I don\u2019t bite.\u201d She went on to say, \u201cActually I could use your help. My boyfriend left for work and I need someone to watch the shower so no one comes in while I take my shower.\u201d Apparently my shyness had gained her trust. The shower had no door, so I stood in front of the opening and turned my back as she disrobed. I stood there for 5 minutes while she showered turning away a couple guys. When she shut off the water she said \u201cGive me just a minute.\u201d The next thing I know she kissed my cheek and said thank you as she walked past me carrying her clothes and wrapped in the tiniest of towels\u2026.. I watched her walk down the hall and enter one of the rooms. End of story. I was so shocked that this had happened, I really didn\u2019t know what to do. I told a couple guys that I worked with what had transpired and they were very nonchalant. \u201cOh, that\u2019s Jeff\u2019s girlfriend Gisela.\u201d Without skipping a beat. A few days later, I went out with my new work friends and Jeff, a rather large guy, and Gisela were there. She saw me and hugged me immediately. While looking over her shoulder hugging her, I could see Jeff staring me down giving me the stink eye. She then turned and told Jeff, \u201cThis is the guy who watched the shower for me the other day.\u201d Jeff stepped toward me and pulled his hand back\u2026. slapped me on the back and said, \u201cThanks for looking out man!\u201d We became friends from that day on.

            "answer_text": "Co-educational is a strange term that started off just meaning males and females going to school together, without there being any sexual connotation. Applying that to your question, it\u2019s unusual for most people to think of any situation where men and women would bathe or shower together without there being anything sexual to it. Bathe, in the historic sense of a community bath, sure. But in showers? OK, I\u2019ll give you one. It\u2019s required that nudists, like anyone else using a shared pool, to shower before entering the pool. As is common in other places, there\u2019s outdoor showers there for that purpose. But at nudist facilities there\u2019s usually several open showers side by side and men, women, boys, and girls shower there in sight of everyone, completely naked, no differently than they would at a public pool wearing swimming suits. Because to us, there is no difference. That extends to using open outdoor showers in nudist campgrounds. People line up waiting their turn, chatting with each other while the person in front showers no differently than they do in the privacy of their own home. That\u2019s all perfectly normal and yes, there\u2019s nothing sexual about it. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. Sexuality is naturally and easily separate from nudity, which itself is an artificial made up term that does nothing but describe people as being human, looking like themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "My middle school back in Ukraine had an open communal shower and locker room. Everyone would shower and change clothes in the same large room, both boys and girls. Everyone was respectful of each other and the coach/instructor watched us from her office to make sure there weren\u2019t any problems. All the students saw each other naked every day so we just got used to it and it became routine. The girls with large breasts and the boys with large muscles got stared at the most, but there were never any issues with disrespect. When we moved to America my high school had separate locker rooms so I had to get used to that. I would not say it was better, just different. ",

However, with females visiting and staying over before that we always had a co-ed bathroom and shower Each floor had 12 residents and one bathroom with two urinals, three toilet stalls and one large shower with two nozzles that easily accommodated two people. We had a sign on the outside of the bathroom door indicating that the shower was Free or being used by Males or Females. Therefore, you waited your turn, or went to a different floor. However, males and females used the sinks and the toilets at the same time. As the toilet stalls each had their own door. Easy. Indeed, just like my home. ",
