            "answer_text": "Can you compare them ? Really and truly, absolutely not !  Each of them have their own unique voices, bodies, influences, emotions, biographies, goals, styles, musicality,.... So what basis would a comparison have ?! And what purpose would it serve ?They sing/sang in a similar musical genre, but that's about it. One would still be trying to compare apples and oranges.  Joss Stone is, from a stylistic point of view, an awesome singer. (Plus, she's rather nice to look at, if you ask me. :) ) I find her vocal technique questionable, and her husky timbre makes me cringe, to be truthful, but still, she is a very respectable artist, IMHO. And she has the courage to sing in her way regardless of \"armchair experts\" like me finding fault with her sound... Given that she's doing a very good job at doing 'her thing', one can only respect her for it.The final question is: Does her music speak to you or not...? ",

            "answer_text": "As a huge fan of Amy Winehouse I will say no. Joss Stone is a good singer and she has some great songs but she does not compare to either Amy Winehouse nor Adele since she in no way has the same talent as these women and she\u2019s not as famous as them. The only thing I would say Joss Stone, Winehouse and Adele has in common is the genre of their music, which I also don\u2019t think is to similar to one another. ",

            "answer_text": "Joss Stone is a really awesome singer, although I am not into her music. Sure, I know that there are people who think that her voice needs a little polishing, but personally I like the rather raspy tone she possesses a lot, which might be seen as a flaw by others. Compared to Adele or Amy Winehouse, however, I think she is not comparable, because all of them have different styles of singing and deserve respect for being successful in what they are doing. ",
