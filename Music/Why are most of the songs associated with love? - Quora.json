            "answer_text": "Because love makes the world go round baby. We do everything in the world because of love. You go to work because of love , you love someone or your parents love you so they have to work to take care of you. If you want a trendy girlfriend you love you have to work to take care of her. So practically love is what makes you get up in the morning. Love is equal to hate . Both at extremes . At one point in our lives we must feel it , it is the simplest yet the most difficult thing to give to someone . Its a natural feeling, you can\u2019t buy love. So it is but natural that people put down that feeling in writings, and poems, and love songs. Music is a thing that when it hits you, you feel no pain , as someone once said I can\u2019t remember who for now. When you are inlove how do you feel ? don\u2019t you want to sing to the world? When you have had a good night of lovemaking with your special one in the morning don\u2019t you want to tell the worl about what you did last night? Love songs are just the way people feel about themselves, their special one, a special sitauation they are in.  Most of the time that love can\u2019t be expressed so we put it down in a song hoping that person will understand our feelings. In the old testament, GOD gave the 10 comandments, but in the new testament, JESUS gave just one : Love your neighbour as you love yourself. If you love your neighbour as you love your self there will be no need for all the blood bath in the world. So we are being ruled by love . Thank you. ",
