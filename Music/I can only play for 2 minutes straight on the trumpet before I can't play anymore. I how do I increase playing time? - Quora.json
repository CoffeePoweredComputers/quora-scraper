            "answer_text": "My answer to almost all brass playing questions like this is: Get a good teacher. It is impossible to diagnose your problem without actually seeing/hearing you play. It could be too much pressure or not enough pressure. Anyway here are the resources: TrumpetHerald.com, BBtrumpet.com, TPIN ( a mailing list). Skyping teachers:Jeanne Pocius, John Mohan, and (I think) Rich Willey. There are others and you can find them by following the links I just gave you. Greg Spence has youtube videos geared to beginners as does Marcus Printup ",
