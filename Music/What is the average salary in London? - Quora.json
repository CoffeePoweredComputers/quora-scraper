            "answer_text": "The median full time salary, before tax, in London is \u00a339,476.  How an average salary in London compares to other big cities If you earn more than that, you are doing better than half the people around you. Is that good? That is a value judgement for you. It is worth noting that the distribution of incomes in London is huge, and there will be groups of people who are amazed that anyone can survive in London on less than \u00a360k, and would count any salary below \u00a3100k as poor. If you are considering moving to London from abroad you need to bear in mind that the median includes counting the salaries of many people who also receive public subsidies in the form of direct benefits or social housing, neither of which would be available to a foreign arrival in the city.

            "answer_text": "That would depend on the role. There is a minimum wage, which in April 2019 will be \u00a38.21 and hour, but the real living wage is about \u00a310.55. Salary wise to live in London as well as work in London, this is not easily achieveable on less than \u00a335k given central London rental prices will cost upwards of \u00a31200 for a one bedroom apartment. buying property in London would be unachievable to most on less than a 6 figure salary. The cost of commuting into London isn\u2019t cheap but would save you money from renting/ buying in London so you could accept a slightly lower salary. I think most would regards \u00a350k plus as a reasonable to good salary in London, but it\u2019s relative to the role and lifestyle choices as well. ",
