            "answer_text": "From a distance we don\u2019t know how it feels but when we are affected by what\u2019s happening in our very own lives; then we are bitterly shaken up so much so that we are not having any words at all. Its sheer disbelief that life had to part ways and draw the separation of our loved one\u2019s ever esteemed presence in our life\u2019s ever cherished spheres. Whichever experience we tend to undergo, a sense of equanimity/serenity must be established from which platform we are able to re emerge and take charge of our lives. Otherwise, when we are deluged/mired by unfathomable sadness, the degrees/tendencies that we entwined ourselves within might be quite intense. So this establishment of an equanimous approach is not preparing for sadness or other calamity particularly to befall us-but rather, orientating our disciplined insight and outlook in such a manner-that regardless of whenever anything ever occurs, we are first of all firmly strengthening our bearings. For this is where our core roots emanate from and tend to sustain the very evolution of our being and the more we go away from our very own selves; all the more the difficulties in being brought back abruptly to resolve/sort out certain matters. Some of us reflect on the being like whereas our pure mindfulness-like being-meaning any time/any state of being; that like is about the adaptation-not the like that is from the liking or disliking. For when we are adept at how we are ever being; then all that we are becoming is more proficient and full of awareness. And that is what is extremely essential - that at any given point in/across time-its realizing our values as well as valuing our realization; as we observe the essence of a disciplined perspective in all that we are ever being- we tend to become more likewise competent in being able to maturely deal/interact with all that we might tend to come across far more observantly/maturely and precisely-that leads to being more effectively in control and awareness of being/evolving.

            "answer_text": "The Bible says in Job that man is born to sorrows as the sparks fly upward. It is the fallen, sin nature of man that drives pain and sorrow and the fact that we have an enemy, satan, who is the prince of this world who only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. John 10:10. Yet, he masquerades as an angel of light. 2 Corinthians 11:14. The Bible says he is, in fact, the father of all lies. The lie is his most powerful weapon. He seeks to cause people to either doubt God or create their own version of God or not even believe in Him at all and be their own gods. But oh, what a mess we make of things when we do not listen to God\u2019s all knowing, all loving wisdom in His Word, the Bible. We live in a beautiful yet broken world. We are no longer in the Garden of Eden and so until Jesus comes back to make a new heaven and a new earth there will be continue to be much pain and sorrow. But for true followers of Christ we do not sorrow as the world does because we have eternal hope in Him. And remember that love and sorrow flow mingled down together. It is only in having pain and sorrow that we can experience the greatest joy when we are thankful anyway for all God has given. Weeping endures for a night but joy comes in the morning. May God bring peace and relief from your sorrow, friend. ",
