            "answer_text": "There are a number of ways to answer this. But the simplest is this: Failure to optimize resources. An economy always starts and ends with human beings within the context of a recognized group and in comparison with other groups. This holds true regardless of how one chooses to delineate those groups whether naturally as is the case of a family or artificially as is the case of a PAC. Artificial constructs however that subsume the very natural that should empower them tend to sow the very seeds of their own destruction depending on how long and to the extent to which they run afoul of the natural order of things to wit: person, family, neighborhood, community, city, state, nation. The notion of global community or global village is a sick joke perpetrated by transnational corporations and politicians whose pockets have an interest in perpetuating such a lie. But what of resources other than human? Any successful martialing of resources for any given economy must have as its basis a healthy respect of res publica the things which are appropriately public and the private from which it derives it\u2019s strength. To the extent that any nation state follows this republican ideal then that state will be more fully developed. To the extant that it does not then democratic mob rule, demogoguery, and rapacious technocratic corporate cronyism will abound with it\u2019s attendent amoral immoral elitist pretensions where other equally immoral/amoral political elites under the pretext of social justice and \u201cfairness\u201d, meddling \u201cdogooders\u201d will violate the republic\u2019s inherent strengths with their destructive central planning and distract all with bread and circuses while the republic bleed and we all become beholden to a hegemonic state that is antithetical to liberty and the natural order of things. The republic will bleed while the so called \u201cdogooders\u201d, vampires, and their parasitic cronies lap it up. There\u2019s your underdeveloped economy and this \u201cmodel\u201d if you will, is being currently attempted around the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Some other features: Higher proportion of population who depend on farming for their well being. The agricultural sector is still not heavily industrialized, resulting in more people tied up in the least valuable economic sector.Very small scientific and academics culture. People just go into college for the \u201cdream\u201d of better pay. General scientific awareness is low. The low number of phd graduates in underdeveloped countries reflects this.Low overall productivity from the population, which is the result of numerous factors: low education, bad infrastructure, inadequate health and public services, lack of technology proficiency, or sometimes just bad work ethics.Low level of financial literacy. People don\u2019t know how to invest and plan their life financially.High birth rate. Combined with financial illiteracy, it\u2019s a recipe of disaster.Society is highly traditional and conservative. Some are also highly superstitious / religious. Although in some cases, this actually is not an issue, for example, Japan is still somewhat a traditional and superstitious society, but they\u2019ve managed well.",

            "answer_text": "When we talk about an underdeveloped economy we usually refer to: An economy that is lagging behind the rest of the world in terms of how sophisticated their economy limited by their technology but have the potential and resources to grow and develop. Examples include many developing countries that have the human capital (labor) and some natural resources that would give them the possibility of industrialize and move to the next stage of development. For these economies foreign capital and expertise is essential for them to make this leap (Example: Singapore).The key differentiator between developed country and economy is that for economy we are mainly interested in whether it has the scope and possibility of developing given its circumstances at a point in time. On the other hand, being a developed country may involve other factors such as civil rights movement, military capabilities etc. However there are strong correlation between the two which is why developed countries usually have economies that are considered developed.

            "answer_text": "It means an unconscious arrogance on the part of people living in overdeveloped countries. They may be well meaning - by \u201cdevelopment\u201d they mean lots of well paying jobs, people are able to buy or build high quality homes, afford cars and tv sets, internet and other such luxuries, accompanied by lots of taxes directing cashflow into roads, schools, health and other public goods. But such \u201cdevelopment\u201d is not possible for everybody on the planet, there simply is not the biological capacity for 7.5 billion humans to luxuriate in that kind of \u201cdevelopment\u201d. An appropriate level of development for those who wish to live on Planet Earth in the longer term would be much closer to to what is thought to be an \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d country than an \u201coverdeveloped\u201d one. We can assess this level by looking at the countries which hjave achievged a high level of Human Development at a low Ecological Footprint. Some noice people have done our homework on this one for us - they call it Sustainable Development. I call it common sense. ",

The \u201caid\u201d is designed to deepen the development of underdevelopment: to favor exports of raw materials to industries producing for First World\u2019s consumerist markets at expenses of preventing the development in the Third World where poverty and underdevelopment are fabricated. Development/underdevelopment is to be judged by every country\u2019s economic structures formed through History, and the moment snapshots of the evolution THE PROPERTY STRUCTURE are the portrait of it. Prior to the disaster fabricated by European colonialism and which continues through frustration of Third World\u2019s independence, the societies of today\u2019s Third World may have had \u201clittle\u201d development or development on its own, but had not been \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d in Western sense. The circle of domestic accumulation has never been closed down - it has been impeded from doing so through continuing foreign intervention. Market, same as everything, functions in 3D, the 3rd is the income strata. The \u201cprogress\u201d is not for all the strata. Every upper stratum solves its own problems at expenses of pushing the next inferior one downwards (vertically) or outwards (horizontally). It\u2019s the fight for getting closer to the sun.

Something in the lifestyle that causes one to plow forwards to a beneficent civilised way to live, and one that seems unable to grasp the concept of neatness and hygienic social behaviour. Whilst in the underdeveloped country we see a serious lack of comprehension that leads the populace to behave in a sensible and means to the civilised end they are just as capable of achieving, there seems no will to make their areas something to be proud of, preferring to toss litter where they stand, dump trash everywhere, fail to rein on their often out of control youths, as they thrash around blaming the well ordered and rational neighbours for their lack of progress,. Israel, with clean streets, well constructed buildings, fruitful farms, people dressed in a tidy and stylish manner, kids well educated, shops well designed and operated in a sensible and ordered manner, just like those in the UK, the USA, most of Europe, and any country where logic, and not religious chaos, rules, Wherever destructive religious intolerance to the modern world exists, we see an apparent lack of will to build well, organise socially, unless the religion comes before all else, or where tribalism directs the path of social life, thereby giving no latitude towards an ordered and rational progressive development. Where a nation has managed to reach an equivalent social status, it has generally been by the force of military might, a concept that seems to be unacceptable to some powers, who then set out to \u2018educate\u2019 an often unwilling population in to the ways of \u2018democracy\u2019 lessons that were unnecessary, and of an instant almost, drag those well ordered nations back into the squalor and state of underdevelopment they had escaped from.

In this context I would name Russia, USA and others amongst the least developed as there is huge contrast in \u201cdevelopement\u201d of elites and common people. And I could understand it as \u2026 developed means that people are happy with their lives and undeveloped as unhappy with their lives. Surprisingly\u2026 here a lot would change, wouldn\u2019t it?
