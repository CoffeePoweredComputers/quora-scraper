            "answer_text": "Well that's what I was wondering Gangnam style become global hot bc of: The music is catchy: The rhythm is simple and repetitive.Synergy between the music and visuals: The visuals are cut to fit the rhythm really well, making the most of the interaction between the two.Silly but fun: Yes, it is silly, but, as someone in the group said, \u201cit is a pure joy to watch.\u201dAmbiguity and intrigue: Several of the scenes are ambiguous and make people wonder what is going on. Who is the guy in the sports car? What\u2019s up with the guy in the elevator?Doesn\u2019t take itself seriously: Psy is making fun of himself while making fun of every pop video clich\u00e9 you have ever seen.South Korean cool: Would the video have the same appeal if it came from a U.S. or UK rapper? The origins of the video lend it a certain charm for people elsewhere in the world.The format lends itself to parody: Whether it is the Thai Navy, Eton School or My Little Pony, the video provides content that is easy to replicate.The dance: It is simple to learn and extends the engagement from the digital to the physical world.The back story: The fact that Gangnam is a district in Seoul, originally somewhat seedy but now the haunt of the nouveau riche lends extra depth to the video\u2019s success.Peer pressure: Now that the video has been seen by so many people, peer pressure encourages people to watch the video in self-defense \u2013 \u201cWhat? You still have not watched it? Lame!\u201dAll of these factors combine to make Gangnam Style a video with LEGS that have carried it around the world. Of course, as detailed in this post here, Gangnam Style would not have been so successful if YG Entertainment had not prepared the ground well. The company is reported to have invested in organically growing an engaged audience, so that when the right song came along, they had a large platform on which to seed the campaign and ensure exposure. Still, seeding alone will not get you a hit. You have to have the right content and Gangnam Style hits the spot on several counts. ",

I think that this break section is the real music mover of the song. Details in the link. The comedy of the video and music is also a big factor, though I don't think that many people in the US catch most of the satire\u2014but they probably can sense that it's there. ",

Speaking from an international perspective, it was mainly the signature dance moves and intense music that made it catch people\u2019s attention and keep them interested/listening. These factors also made the song diverse in that it could be played in clubs, encouraging people to hit the dance floor. Furthermore, the crazy and colourful music video kept the people\u2019s interest as they had a reason to keep talking about it (all the aspects of the MV). Despite the language and lack of familiarity with the artist and genre, the catchiness and uniqueness of the song consequently secured its place in our minds. ",

This is the type of song you can dance to, people like that, that is part of the whole reason that music has changed so much, so people can get down and have fun. The dance itself has become iconic. I guess people like to look like they are riding a horse or bull. But it is very popular and people like to see if they can actually do it. People have made many popular parodies of it. Many of those people would have gone looking for the original to hear how it really sounds. And people like the strangest of things. ",

In South Korea this song receive explosive reception during its release because it satirizes luxurious lifestyle people dream of having in Gangnam, while in fact it may as well be a mirage. The dance is also iconic and easy to follow, that's why many people do cover of this song and it went viral. ",

I believe it was a combination of timing (K-Pop was already on the rise and many people had already taught English in Korea), a catchy beat, a fun simple dance move, and the Internet. Gangnam Style was also a little different than the other big hits at the time, but wasn\u2019t too too different, which is why I think it was able to become a worldwide hit. Any other ideas out there? ",
