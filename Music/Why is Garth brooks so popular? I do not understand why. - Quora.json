            "answer_text": "I understand it, but I see through it. He panders to women. She\u2019s Every Woman is a great example. He tries to sound like he\u2019s praising women in this really advanced way, but it\u2019s basic. \u201cShe\u2019s a strobe of Christmas Lights\u201d? Really? He is overly sweet and saccharine and emotive. Check out Learning To Live Again. He is like that overeager dog who will do anything for approval. He tries to anticipate what the audience wants, instead of being himself. He recorded the song Fever because he wanted men in the rodeo to stop listening to rock and to listen to him. He\u2019s obsessed with the rodeo in a way that only a recording artist whose never been near a rodeo can be. He\u2019s so fake. In his songs, men are always idiots and women are wise and earthy and advanced (That Summer, She\u2019s Gonna Make It, Thunder Rolls). He makes people feel uplifted, but it\u2019s at their expense. George Orwell once wrote that there are no good socialist songs. Clearly he\u2019s never heard We Shall Be Free. A lot of his songs don\u2019t even make sense. What is The River or Standing Outside The Fire even about? He is so in love with himself. People are attracted to confidence. But maybe a philanderer shouldn\u2019t rhapsodize about love? I liked him for the longest time, but I always thought there was something hinky about him, and as soon as I started thinking about it, I changed my mind. I\u2019ll still sing along to his songs. I\u2019ve definitely helped make him rich. I\u2019ll never spend another cent on him though. All you really have to do is listen to George Strait and Garth crumbles. George Strait has fun with it and goes deep, but he delivers like a man, not like my 13 year old sister. I think Tracy Lawrence never got his due. He\u2019s better than Garth. Alan Jackson has a lot of dumb little songs that are embarrassing. Little Bitty is hokier than Garth\u2019s Two of A Kind, but when Alan Jackson gets real, he\u2019s great. Dallas comes out of Jackson so easily. Then listen to Garth pour himself out all over the floor like a spilled bucket of tears in The Change and there\u2019s no contest. The Dance is a good song, but it\u2019s hardly one of the best songs of all time. It\u2019s quite short. Anyone who spent his fans\u2019 time flying through an arena suspended by invisible strings is buying too much of his own press. ",

            "answer_text": "I have no idea why Garth Brooks is so popular. I always considered him a poser. I felt that he calculated his image and what would pass as a country artist. He was actually someone who wanted to get into rock, but he never caught on or something. Just to show how insincere he was, he put out an album under a rock under a pseudonym that everyone knew was Garth. It was supposed to be clever or prove how talented he was or speeds. It only showed me how much he used his label\u2019s market research division to find out what sold. This does not spell devoted artist to me. Every time I see him with that stupid hat on and that phony grin, I think even less of the guy. I think he was one of the most calculating performers of his day. ",
