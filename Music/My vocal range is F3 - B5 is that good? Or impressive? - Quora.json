            "answer_text": "Middle C is C4, so you have a good range of about 2 octaves. This is the minimum for a vocal career. However, range is not enough on its own. You also need to have a good tone/timbre to your voice so that it is attractive to listen to. For example, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and the 1970s Elvis all have the same vocal range, but they don\u2019t have the same vocal quality. Elvis has the better quality voice. ",
