            "answer_text": "The Best Bands that have more than one lead Vocalists, in my opinion, are: The B-52s  This band features a line-up of a Drummer, a Guitarist (who only plays with 4 strings) and three Vocalists. The Three Vocalists, Fred Schneider, Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson, all sang solos on their hit song \u201cLove Shack\u201d, while one of them usually performs the lead vocals on other songs such as Fred on \u201cRock Lobster\u201d. The Beach Boys  In spite of this band going through multiple line-up changes over it\u2019s 55 years in existence, all of the members have sung lead vocals on at least one of the songs attributed to this group. While Mike Love sang the lead vocals on most of their hit songs, brothers Brian & Carl Wilson sung lead on the ballad \u201cGod Only Knows\u201d while their brother Dennis Wilson and fellow member Al Jardine sang lead on other, more upbeat tunes. The Beatles  While either John Lennon and / or Paul McCartney performed Lead Vocals on most of their recordings, lead guitarist George Harrison contributed vocal solos on songs such as \u201cSomething\u201d and \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d, while drummer Ringo Starr performed lead vocal duties on songs such as \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d. Fleetwood Mac  While this band has also gone through multiple line-up changes during it\u2019s 45\u201350 year existence, there have also been multiple band members who have took turns singing lead vocals, such as Stevie Nicks, guitarist Lindsay Buckingham and keyboardist Christine McVie. Lady Antebellum  Most of the band\u2019s songs, including their signature song \u201cNeed You Now\u201d, features lead vocals sung by both Hilary Scott and Charles Kelley. While Hilary & Charles usually sing in a duet on most of those songs, there are a few songs that only feature lead vocals from either Hilary or Charles. The Temptations  This Five-man Boy Band\u2019s Line-Up has consistently changed over their almost six decades in existence. In spite of that, however, pretty much all the members of the band would sing lead vocals. Some, such as David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks & Dennis Edwards, were primarily lead singers while others sang lead on very few songs.

But looking at Lead vocals in Band Songs it looks like Garth did no singing, and Robbie just sang on a few. I don\u2019t have a live video of him singing lead. But he is supposed to be singing lead here.  ",
