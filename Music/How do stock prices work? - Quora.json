            "answer_text": "On listed stocks, each stock is assigned a \u2018specialist\u2019 whose function is to maintain an \u2018orderly\u2019 market. The specialists job is to stand ready to buy or sell a particular stock at a listed price. He will typically maintain an inventory of shares of the stock and he maintains an \u2018order\u2019 book of \u2018limit\u2019 orders from people who have indicated an interest in buying or selling the stock at a certain price. the specialists role is to maintain the market he moves the bid and the ask prices in response to supply and demand and what is in his book. The OTC market has a similar system but substitutes for specialists \u2018market makers\u2019 each of whom has assumed the same function and is therefore said to be \u2018making a market\u2019 in the given shares. Again, supply/demand/price arbitrage maintains the prices. the OTC market reports trades through the NASDAQ system, (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System). The third market (institutional trades) set their prices directly between buyer and seller but because any third market player is free to approach the specialist for execution of his trade, the specialists function acts as a discipline on the 3rd market. other than that, it\u2019s supply/demand/arbitrage that set prices. Since so much trading activity is driven by computerized trading system, while it\u2019s generally \u2018efficient\u2019 it is occasionally subject to some huge volatility. ",

            "answer_text": "Stock prices are dependent upon the earnings of the company. If the company earns more money, the stock price goes up. A company may be valued at $100/share because Analysts see that in the future, which price is based on, the company will do well. Let\u2019s use Apple again. If Apple says in February 2020 that they are releasing a new car concept by December the share price is going to skyrocket because Apple has just entered another category: cars. It\u2019s all about Earnings Per Share! ",
