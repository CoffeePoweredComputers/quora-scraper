            "answer_text": "The sad truth is, that they crested in the late Sixties and then faded in the early Seventies like all the other pop bands of that era. Their commercial success started in 1966 with \u201cAll comes Mary\u201d\u2019, soon followed by \u201cCherish\u201d, \u201cWindy\u201d and \u201cNever My Love\u201d. After that, their performances were not as strong, nor as reliable. By the early Seventies, their albums were not even charting in the Top 100s. The band lineups began to change - a lot. Eventually the list of former cast members looks like a telephone directory. They weren\u2019t selling records, but they were still doing concerts. By 1978, only one of the original 1967 lineup member was still left, Ted Bleuchel, when the band collapsed, leaving him in debt. Out of desperation, he \u2018franchised\u2019 the name \u201cThe Association\u201d out to a fake group to keep doing tours. During the 1980s, there was a resurgence of sorts and an interest in the old 60s pop bands. Along with The Turtles and Spanky and Our Gang, the some of the original members reformed The Association and began touring again. They have been ever since. The roster has constantly shifted in and out across the years. And sometimes they are in the studios, recording. Some have retired, and some have passed away. In 2016, The Association was inducted into the Pop Music Hall of Fame. ",

I\u2019m thinking they just got tired of success or something, and then, poof, everything seemed to change. Music got edgier, oh yeah there was still plenty of pop being produced in the 1970\u2019s but you know, it just wasn\u2019t their time anymore. And then . . . \u201cAlong Comes Mary\u201d Dickie Smothers likes this! The Association \u201cAlong Comes Mary\u201d  Crazy! It was all a machine? Who knew? Decades later these guys oiled up the machine and got it running again. Bloodhound Gang \u201cAlong Comes Mary\u201d  It\u2019s amazing what they can do with animatronics! Anyway, I think they took drugs and you know, they rest is history. Now my empty cup is as sweet as the punch . . . ",
