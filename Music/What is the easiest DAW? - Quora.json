            "answer_text": "Well, I have been using FL Studio for close to 3 years now, and I think it\u2019s pretty easy to use. But I left it 2 weeks ago, because of the fact that my tracks would sound horrible even after mixing and mastering. I switched to Logic Pro X after that, and it is no wonder why it is the best DAW in the world. It is extremely easy to use and understand, and mixing and automation is just as simple as in FL. However, sidechaining the kick and bass is a bit more difficult than it is with FL, where\u2019d I\u2019d just use Gross beat instead of Fabfilter Pro; I use the stock compressor with Logic, and I must say, it\u2019s more professional to use. So yeah, if you are just after ease of use, then get FL Studio. If you want ultimate professionalism and ease of use at the same time, get Logic Pro X ",
