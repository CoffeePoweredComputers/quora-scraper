            "answer_text": "So getting your music heard by a record label is a bit of a tricky business. Some record labels will accept demos without solicitation and they will usually have this information posted on their website. Usually you will need to either mail in a physical copy (some what out dated but sometimes they request it), or they will have an A/R contact to email your demo to, preferably in MP3. NOW\u2026.. the vast majority of record labels that are established, major, etc. do not accept unsolicited demos meaning they won\u2019t open your envelope or email. Record labels already receive a ton of submissions from their own personal network and people they know and work with who are bringing them leads like band managers, booking agents, etc. The people in their network will get priority over anything else. If you really want to stand out and get heard the first thing you need to do is write amazing music. The better your music the more likely it is you will be heard. And once you have amazing music, then you need to go out and play it A LOT (I once played in a band that self booked 285 shows across the US in one year for example). The last step is to have a fan base. If you are writing great music, playing out frequently and can bring people to shows consistently night after night more likely than not someone from a record label will be in touch with you instead of you trying to figure out how to get in contact with them. Record labels have a lot of scouts out there that have their ears to the ground. You may not see or hear about them, but if you are making any sort of impact they will end up finding you. If a record label doesn\u2019t find you a manager probably will and if they are a good manager they will have the contacts to get you in front of an A/R rep that can make decisions. Last piece of advice I would give is do not get into being in a band or writing music to get \u201csigned\u201d. A lot of bands can now find success without a record label. Go out and have fun and enjoy it, learn how to distribute your own music independently and you may find you don\u2019t need a record label. ",

            "answer_text": "John. Record labels don\u2019t work the way the use to anymore. Their business model is not spent searching in clubs and at record stores for the hottest new thing anymore. Today\u2019s artists have to be creating significant \u201cbuzz\u201d with their music and brand to get noticed with the data to back it up (which is why many are completely satisfied creating music and making a living from it independently without the help of a major corporation like a record label). The buzz you will need could be in the form of income generated by streams of your music on digital platforms or significant fan engagement at live shows and across their social media. Usually a combination of both. Asking how you can get a record label to look at or listen to your work is the last question you should ask if you or your band are a serious music act. The question should be what have I been doing to get to that point first in order to be even talking record labels. Ask yourself: Am I releasing engaging content (recordings, photos and videos) across all my social media platforms and getting great fan excitement and feedback each time (or only a few likes and compliments from close friends)? Is my level of fan engagement and excitement over my music and brand bringing a significant amount of folks out to hear my live shows? Do I have touring experience already and fans in other areas interested in hearing me live besides locally? Is my already released music and merch both selling well at live shows and also getting a fair amount of streams across major streaming services like Apple and Spotify? Are my original songs being considered for licensing and placements in film or TV? If all these things are going on then certainly it is time to ask your question. But by then you\u2019ll already know the answer because THEY\u2019LL be coming to you with an interest in signing you. :) The bottom line is get them to come to YOU with enough buzz about your music happening and your very marketable brand going on with proof and numbers that they can see as profitable in the future for them and you. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I think labels are almost completely irrelevant to most artists looking to release music. There are two websites I recommend - CDBaby and TuneCore - that allow you to get your music into services like iTunes. CDBaby and TuneCore both charge $35 per upload (an upload can be one song or one album, so spend wisely!). After that, CDBaby takes 9% of each sale ($.09 for every $.99 track on iTunes). TuneCore doesn't charge anything per sale, but you must pay a $20 fee per upload every year (again, spend wisely!). Which one is for you depends on how many sales you expect during the course of the year. At 223 sales, you're paying CDBaby $20. Public Enemy released an album through TuneCore in 2007. They obviously expected more than 223 sales! Be realistic. Also remember iTunes and other services will take their own cut (30% per sale from iTunes, I believe). All of this is to say - be your own label! Maybe hire a publicist, but all of the services that used to be provided by labels are now easily accessible online! ",

Unfortunately the above isn't going to happen.  However, i can give you a secret formula which has driven labels to release artists music for decades.

            "answer_text": "Hi, gone are the days when artists and musicians had to visit Music labels and distribution companies. You can now release your music and keep 100% of your royalties by your own record label. I'll share my journey as an artist with a digital distribution service called Distrokid. I joined this service 2 years ago to release a song on digital music platforms. I paid around $20 as annual subscription fee. So, what I received with the package? Well, the company offers artists to release unlimited songs and music to all major digital platforms like Apple iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, JioSaavn, YouTube MUSIC and other leading sites. This mean, I can release as many songs as I can can during my annual subscription and keep 100% of the sales and royalties for my music. Plus, they help us to get verified artist status on Spotify, Apple Music and others. I received verified profile on Spotify within hours of account creation. One best part is that you can create your own custom record label while releasing music. I would suggest you to check about distrokid and you'll know many renowned artists have used their service to get ahead in their career. One thing I'll like to mention, they run a special discount program in which artists get to trial distrokid services at 7% discount.

You may need a record label for covering marketing and promotional expenses, but if your songs/tracks are produced/recorded/finalized already, you can release it yourself, especially when it comes to digital formats, using one of the many digital distribution companies out there.

Also, be honest with yourself about how large an audience your music can reach and how \u201cbig\u201d you want to get in the first place. Then, question yourself about what you expect to get out of a label. Money? There\u2019s less of that to go around these days. Creative freedom? You often trade that in for the money. Distribution? There\u2019s so much you can do yourself with services like Soundcloud, Bandcamp and Spotify. If you still think you\u2019re \u201clabel material,\u201d research the labels that release music in the genres closest to yours, then try to find an insider who will let you buy them lunch to find out a little bit more about how that label finds artists and the process of adding to their roster. Finally, don\u2019t even try it until you have worked your butt off to be the best singer/songwriter/producer/musician (pick a talent) you can be! Good luck - hope that helps. ",
