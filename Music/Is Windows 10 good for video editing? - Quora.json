            "answer_text": "I recently made the switch to a Windows 10 machine after editing on Macs for almost 30 years. I had recently made the jump from Adobe Premiere to Black Magic\u2019s DaVinci Resolve, and my five year old iMac just wasn\u2019t up to the task of doing more complicated editing. In December I built a fast PC for about $950. Resolve is flying now. I will have to say it has taken a minute to get used to the Windows interface, but I\u2019m very comfortable with it now. I still do some work on my Mac systems, but the Windows machine is my main system. ",

            "answer_text": "The operating system (Windows 10) is mostly irrelevant. The hardware and application(s) that you use matter much more than the OS, so long as the operating system\u2019s drivers for the hardware are robust. The only thing about Windows 10 that\u2019s off-putting to most people is using it outside the video editing software. It\u2019s got a lot of inconsistent UI elements and organization, but people adjust to the awkwardness of it pretty quickly. ",
