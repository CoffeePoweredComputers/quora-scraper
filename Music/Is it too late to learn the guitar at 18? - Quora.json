            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. I first picked it up at 19\u201320 (i\u2019m now 21) and began by simply just fooling around, playing single notes listening to a song I enjoyed, learning the basic chords etc. From there, I started to ask myself \u201cwhat really is the difference between me and these \u2018god\u2019 guitar players?\u201d The simple answer? Developing the patience, and over time, knowledge needed to actually stop. and set aside any obsessive thoughts that may be rotating in ones subconscious when learning (no matter what they may be). Perhaps the greats were introduced to clear, enshrouded listening at an earlier age and seen this particular medium as an achievable means of nonverbally expressing any strongly held emotions they may hold onto. This is where passion and motivation come into it. Try listening to any song and dissecting different lines of music (drums, bass etc.), this can give you a sense of the power, and voice of the individual. Putting yourself in the company of other musicians can also vastly improve your current level of playing, as well greatly give you perspective on the value of friendships/relationships . Playing within a rhythm makes it a challenge, and imo there is no better feeling than accomplishing something you could previously, otherwise not do - whether it be learning a chord, figuring out scales, riffs, licks etc. It\u2019s fascinating really. There\u2019s no real rules for playing music, just ideas passed from one generation to another. But once you have some of these down and a brief understanding of the fretboard, there are endless possibilities! N.B. Playing like a pro takes incremental practice. Make achievable goals for yourself and keep challenging what you already know. You\u2019ll be a pro in no time bro ;) ",

            "answer_text": "It is NEVER too late to start learning the guitar, and especially not when you are only 18! When I started playing in the 90\u2019s (I was around 15/16) every single interview I read in Guitar World magazine and others had the players stating that they started when at some ungodly age of 10 or 11 or even earlier. It bummed me out seriously. I remember reading about Joe Bonamassa starting to fuck around with scales at the age of 7(!) and I thought that\u2019s it, I\u2019m bloody doomed. But you know what? I thought \u2018fuck that\u2019 and started practising every waking moment of every day. Because I wanted to get good at it! And I loved how playing and practising made me feel! Now I am not suggesting that everyone should or would want to practise 10 hours a day but your question also holds the answer for you. If you just wanted to strum a few chords, you would not have cared about what age you started, but because how you questioned it, in fact states that you want to get good and that you DO care. And if you care, NOTHING will stop you, least of all the age you started at. If you want to get good it means you care! If you care, you WILL do it! And you will practise and you will get good! Because you care! And fuck what anyone else may think or say. It makes YOU happy thus nothing else matters. PS: The notion of starting very early in life comes from back in the day of classical music, where starting at the age of 10 was deemed way too late to become a life-changing virtuoso. There are some much more recent studies done that proves that because information is so freely accessible in modern times the starting age is of much less importance these days.
