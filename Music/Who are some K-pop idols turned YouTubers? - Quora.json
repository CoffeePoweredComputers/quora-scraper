She was on the show \u2018Unpretty Rapstar\u2019 and had a few music videos from the show aswell I believe. She still release some music now but she's not under any label I believe. Her content is based generally around life in South Korea such as what not to do when visiting, social customs, pros and cons of living in South Korea aswell as alot of good advice for foreign women to keep in mind when visiting the country. She also posts a few videos of her experiences as a trainee. She never mentions which companies she used to be under however she does spill lots of tea. And has made some videos with former Produce48 contestant Alex (Who has now debuted as Alexa) and an ex-idol who's name has slipped my mind \ud83d\ude05. She also made a tea video with the first ever African-American Kpop idol Alex Ried.       ",
