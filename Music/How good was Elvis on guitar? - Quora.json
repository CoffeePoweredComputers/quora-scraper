            "answer_text": "As the saying goes \u201cIf You Judge a Fish by Its Ability to Climb a Tree, It Will Live Its Whole Life Believing that It is Stupid\u201d. Same applies to Elvis. He is often dismissed as a guitarist, because people usually think of lead guitarists when asking the question. To my knowledge, Elvis never was - nor did he claim/strive to be - a lead guitarist. Nor was he a rhythm guitarist in the strict sense of the word, i.e. in a rock or studio band. But what Elvis was - and did it rather well in my opinion - an amazing vocalist able to a certain extent to accompany himself on guitar. One of the best examples is his work for the TV Comeback Special in 1968. During some of the songs he goes beyond basic strumming, throwing in a few blues licks and walking bass lines. Elvis Presley - Baby, What You Want Me To Do (HQ) Now any serious guitarist will probably tell you that\u2019s basic and nothing to write home about, but to a certain extent the same could be said about most of Johnny Cash or Bob Dylan\u2019s work. To put it from a different perspective, Elvis proved himself able to lead his band both vocally and instrumentally (even though he rarely did the latter), something which the likes of Jim Morrison or Mick Jagger - both younger, cooler, and allegedly more sophisticated musicians - would not have been able to do at the time. So to answer your question, Elvis was a decent rhythm guitarist, on par with similar artists of the era. The main problem is that he rarely played guitar on his post-army professional recordings. P.S. Watch \u2018MTV Unplugged in New York\u2019 if you haven\u2019t already done so (I know, I know\u2026 stylistically quite different and taped a quarter of a century apart). Forget about vocal ability or looks, and zoom in on the instrument proficiency of the 2 frontmen. Then ask yourself this: what\u2019s the bigger joke, \u2018Elvis\u2019 and \u2018guitarist\u2019 being mentioned in the same sentence, or Kurt Cobain being considered (by Rolling Stone at least), the 12th greatest guitarist of all times? (ahead of Santana, George Harrison, Brian May, James Burton, Frank Zappa among others). ",

            "answer_text": "I would argue that Elvis was every bit as good a guitarist as he needed to be, and the \u201968 Comeback special is indeed good evidence to that effect. Becoming \u201cgood\u201d on guitar is a function of several factors. Time: Spend hours upon hours month after month playing guitar, and you will develop a certain level of proficiency. I would refer you to Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s New Yorker essay Complexity and the Ten-Thousand-Hour Rule. There are some flaws in Gladwell\u2019s logic, but most of what he contends is largely true: spend a lot of focused time learning how to do something, and you will develop a certain level of proficiency, which we might describe as \u201cgetting good.\u201d It\u2019s hard to know how many hours Elvis put into playing guitar, but it\u2019s a safe bet that he spent a good deal of time with the instrument.Talent: Some people, it would seem, have an innate affinity and ability in certain areas, like playing a musical instrument. The effect of this natural talent is probably self reinforcing. So, if you\u2019re someone who picks up the fundamentals of how to play a guitar fairly easily, you\u2019re probably more likely to put in the hours required to improve your abilities on the instrument. Defining talent is tricky. And it seems plausible that without a certain amount of determination and focus, raw talent is less likely to develop into something fully realized.Physical Ability: Playing guitar is a physical activity. Playing the instrument requires a certain amount of coordination, agility and strength. The size of a person\u2019s hands can even be an important factor. Each guitarist works with what he or she has in terms of physical assets and liabilities. In many ways, this may be an important factor in determining an individual guitarists\u2019 \u201cstyle.\u201dImagination/Intuition/Intellect: Perhaps this is related to talent, but I think that by folding imagination/intuition/intellect into talent we risk overlooking a crucial factor that defines greatness greatness in improvisational genres like rock, jazz, and blues. (I think this is an equally important factor in the realm of composition and songwriting as well.) There are many many guitarists who have a fairly high degree of technical proficiency, but far far fewer who have the imagination, the intuition, and/or the intellect to consistently do interesting and/or creative things with that ability. Put another way, you can have heaps of talent, loads of physical ability, and spend enough time with an instrument to match the proficiency of some of the better guitarists. And yet, you still have to come up with something good to play. This may be what people mean when they say a person has a \u201cgood ear\u201d for music.How would Elvis fare in this context. Hard to know. As a guitarist, he seemed mainly interested in being good enough to accompany himself, which he was able to do quite capably. He clearly had talent and imagination; he spent his time making music; and he was physically able to play the guitar reasonably well. But, it\u2019s probably fair to say that he was more interested in being a singer and a frontman than a virtuoso guitar player. As a point of comparison, I\u2019d look to Jimi Hendrix. He had massive physical gifts and formidable talent. He too accompanied himself on guitar. But he was influenced by blues soloists like Buddy Guy, and by the possibilities afforded by amplified electric guitar. He was a fine singer, but his focus was clearly on the sounds he could make with his guitar rather than with his voice. His imagination/intuition/intellect allowed him to use his talents in a way that was quite singular and transcendent. Just like Elvis, he was as good as he needed to be on guitar. ",
