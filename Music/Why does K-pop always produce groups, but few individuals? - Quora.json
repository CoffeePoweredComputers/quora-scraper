            "answer_text": "Okay so basically, not a lot of kpop idols have that it factor to be a soloist. To be a soloist, they have to be very good and well rounded. They also should be really good at singing, rapping,dancing and also stage presence. Stage presence it very important because it would be really boring to watch a bland performance. I think a lot of idols have things they are good at, but most of them just have one thing like vocals, or dancing, or visuals. For a soloist, I think they are looking for a lot of specific things. I think it\u2019s easier to have groups because all the members have titles on things that they are good at , like main vocal, or main dancer. I hope this made sense! ",
