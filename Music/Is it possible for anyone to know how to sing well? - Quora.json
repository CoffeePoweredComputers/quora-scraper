            "answer_text": "Yes, No, or May be. Beyond training and dedication, it requires one\u2019s ability to achieve such pinnacle of singing. Sometimes we can categorize as May be, because some people might not even try attempting to undergo such training and dedication, so how could one know about it? It is said that it is not that difficult for anyone to sing, but it is difficult to master singing and might take lifetime perfecting singing. Some sing average, some sing better than average, and some can sing better than any musical instruments. For perfecting singing, there are many techniques one can adopt. Not everybody would be successful reaching such point even with equal effort, training and practice. Here are some of my favourite songs. These people has reach to such a point that most of the people will agree (if not all), that they have reached such achievement. Enjoy: Even Piano sounds fade as compared to Cecilia Bartoli\u2019s voice:  Queen of the Night:  observe from 1:43, The Statler Brothers \u201cHow great thou art\u201d  Handel - from the movie Farinelli song \"Lascia Ch'io Pianga\"  Andrea Bocelli:  Maria Callas - O Mio Babbino Caro:  The 3 Tenors:  What can we say about them. They have attained such peak that we can simply enjoy their singing and cherish it. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but enough to pass in a choir? Yes. Amusia is not too common\u2026like out of Earth\u2019s 7B people, there may be 200M people who are actually tone deaf. My old choir director in HS would tell us that even people who are tone deaf can add something in a song even if they can\u2019t sing at all. As long as you can remember a tone and repeat it, you might be able to add something to a song sung in a choir. That said, I\u2019d say most people can learn how to sing decently \u2026maybe just within one octave, just not \u2018well\u2019 to be considered passing. At least that\u2019s my opinion on the matter. Like, Bob Dylan can\u2019t sing \u2018well\u2019 in my opinion but he can somewhat hold a note. to note:I can sing pretty well, I am not good enough to be a popra star with a huge amount of range but I can keep a note, project my voice, do some \u2018tricks\u2019 with my vocal chords (whistle-hum, overtone/polyphonics), possibly could pass in today\u2019s standards.
