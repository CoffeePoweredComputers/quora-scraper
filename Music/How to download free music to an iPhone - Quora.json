            "answer_text": "If you just got a shiny new iPod or iPhone and need help putting your music on it then you\u2019re in luck. We\u2019ve outlined the simple steps to get your Apple device up and running without any guesswork. 1. Download iTunes. You can find the latest version here for free. 2. Add songs to your iTunes library. Open iTunes and go to \u201cFile\u201d and then select \u201cAdd Folder to Library\u201d. Import all the music folders on your computer using this method. You can also add music by purchasing songs from the iTunes music store. 3. Connect your device. Connect your device to your computer using your USB cable. If you\u2019d like to connect wirelessly, scroll down this page to the following section that will guide you through the process. 4. Decide which music to import. You can import your entire catalog of music if your device has the required capacity. If not, then make a playlist with a smaller selection of songs that will fit on your iPod or iPhone. 5. Sync your device. Now it\u2019s time to sync your device, click on the \u201ciPod/iPhone\u201d icon in the left hand column of iTunes. Next click on the \u201cMusic\u201d button in the top bar. Make sure the \u201cSync Music\u201d box is checked. If you\u2019re syncing your whole library then check \u201cEntire music library.\u201d If you\u2019re just syncing a playlist then check \u201cSelected playlists, artists, and genres\u201d and select the playlist you made for your iPod or iPhone. Now select the \u201cSync\u201d button in the bottom right hand corner of iTunes. iTunes will begin syncing your device and will notify you when it\u2019s complete. 6. Eject your device. Once the sync is complete select the small arrow eject button next to the iPod/iPhone icon under devices. Your device is now ready to listen to. Hope that helps you! ",
