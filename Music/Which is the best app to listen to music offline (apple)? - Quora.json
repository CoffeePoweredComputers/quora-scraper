            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on what you mean by offline. You can download songs and not access the files with SoundCloud Go, which starts at $4.99 a month. There are some rumors that SoundCloud is dying, though those have been around for months as of September 2017, and SoundCloud is still running fine. SoundCloud is the #1 goto place for most underground or independent artists to post their music. If you like underground music, I'd recommend SoundCloud. (Go Premium - Listen to music) You can download songs and not access the files with Spotify Premium, which is $9.99 a month. Spotify's focus is more on large record labels, so you'll get a lot more big-name artists when using Spotify. (Music for everyone.) You can download actual song files using Bandcamp. You'll get a choice between WAV, MP3, FLAC, and more formats that you can play using iTunes, Amazon Music, or whatever player you like that plays local files. It's used by mostly independent or underground artists. (Bandcamp) You can download songs and not access the files with YouTube Red, which has a semi-okay-I-guess UI for music, and has a large combination of both big-name artists and underground music.
