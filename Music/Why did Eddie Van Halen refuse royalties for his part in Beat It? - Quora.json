            "answer_text": "Edward and David Lee Roth have competitive personalities. The on-going competetive tensions between Ed and Dave played a significant role when David Lee Roth quit (or was fired, depending on who is telling the story). Ed and Dave discouraged band members from doing side projects. They didn\u2019t want other bands to steal Van Halen\u2019s thunder, and didn\u2019t want other Van Halen members to receive more recognition than they were outside of Vam Halen. Ed received the call from Quincy Jones when the other guys weren\u2019t around. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure they were all out of town for some reason. Remember- in 1983, pre-Thriller, there was no overlap between rock and R&B music genres. MTV didn\u2019t include any black artists on their channel. Ed didn\u2019t think anybody from his band or fan base would notice his guitar playing on a Michael Jackson album so he drove out to the studio and in a matter of minutes recorded two takes that were cut and pasted by Quincy to create what made it on the record. Quincy asked Ed to solo over the chorus section, but Ed suggested that he solo over the verse section to accomodate a more interesting solo. Quincy went with Ed\u2019s suggestion, so he should have received credits and royalties for both his performance and arrangement. Of course Thriller went on to become the best selling record of all time, and Michael Jackson\u2019s music videos dominated MTV. Rock fans embraced Beat It as the album became the first to successfully cross the two genres. It became common knowledge that Ed played the guitar solo on Beat It, and it didn\u2019t take long for the rest of the band to realize this too. The band wasn\u2019t happy about what Ed did, because guess which album sat at #1 on the charts while \u201c1984\u201d was at #2? That\u2019s right- Ed is one of the few musicians to play on simultaneous #1 and #2 records. In summary, Ed didn\u2019t get paid for his work on Beat It because he didn\u2019t want to call attention to it and it required very little effort on his part. \\m/__\\m/ ",

            "answer_text": "Who knows with Eddie. In an interview, Eddie stated that one day he checked is answering machine at home and heard a message about playing on a track. The person talking on the machine introduced himself as Quincy Jones. Eddie, thinking it was a prank, erased the message. Sometime later, Quincy Jones called again and managed to get Eddie on the phone. Eddie went on to say he hung up on Mr. Jones, thinking again it was a prank caller. Quincy called back and was able to convince Eddie that it was indeed not a prank, Eddie agreed to play on it and was sent the track. Eddie then goes on to tell how he just took a couple of passes at it until he recorded something he felt was satisfactory. Maybe Eddie felt like it wasn\u2019t his best work? Who knows. Eddie said something else in that interview that has always stuck with me: \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily like what I always do, but it\u2019s fun.\u201d ",
