            "answer_text": "I think it came from I.T. (or Marketing) people who didn\u2019t know any better so when they made music apps they used the term Song instead of Track to denote the pieces (another fully valid term only indicating no words) on the Album. People using these apps tended not to understand that Songs belong on an Album so it all became a mess o loose Songs on Playlists. The Song term stuck despite it being the sillier choice. ",

A song can be anything either instrumentally composed or vocally constructed to being pleasure to those listening to it. ",
