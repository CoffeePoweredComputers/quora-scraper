            "answer_text": "Yes, you have a very unlikely chance to do so. Here are some reasons why. If your age is close to Jimin\u2019s then likely you can marry him. Depending where you live with Jimin and allows you to have that certain age gap is perfectly fine and is legal. Though you have a very unlikely chance, you never know.Reaching Jimin\u2019s standards. Well, according to Jimin himself, he has standards for a girl, maybe pretty legs, foreigner who knows how to speak Korean. You never know, he could be picky. Every BTS member has a standard for a girl or interest.Drama. Jimin might not want to marry you due to his career or reputation, as a KPOP star, retired or not, could effect him a lot. This is for the safety of you from \u2018saesang\u2019 fans or netisens claiming/calling you names.Relationship. Now we all know that before you marry someone, you must be dating. It\u2019s likelier you can date him than marry him. He could instantly dump you over a few months saying it\u2019s not working because he\u2019s an idol.I\u2019m not getting in the way of you and Jimin, but I honestly don\u2019t think that, I have a chance with BTS. I\u2019m not causing any drama but you do what you do and dream whatever you want to. ARMY~~ ^-^ ",

            "answer_text": "There is always a possibility. But it is very very small if you: are young. (idk 18 or less, probably)are a fan. (obsessive over him, or BTS)do not speak Korean. (he isn\u2019t that fluent in English, so if you run into him at a club or whatever, he most probably won\u2019t speak to you if you talk to him in English. He wants someone he can easily communicate with.)want him for his fame/money/looks. (this one is pretty self explanatory.)do not match his personal standards, regarding personality and looks.Please do not obsess over the idea of marrying your idol, the chance of that happening is really small, since they barely have time for relationships and obviously don\u2019t want overboard fans who post or talk about everything with everyone. When the time comes, they will choose someone whom they love and loves them. Might be you, might not be you. ",
