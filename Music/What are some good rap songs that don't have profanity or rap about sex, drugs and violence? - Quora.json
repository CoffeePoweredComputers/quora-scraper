You Light Me Up by Open Sky\u2026.I hate to admit I like this but I do. It\u2019s\u2026 not a good rap, and it\u2019s super corny but Idk something about it has always made me happy. Lmao they are kinda of not even rapping.. it\u2019s just talking. Yet.. I still felt the need to include it in the list lol  Alligator Sky by Owl City Ft Shawn Chrystopher  Alligator Sky by Owl City Ft B.O.B. (there\u2019s two versions with two different rappers\u2026this version isn\u2019t as good as one solid piece I think, but I like the rap still)  Well.. that\u2019s all I can think of for now, so hopefully you like at least one or some of these ones!
