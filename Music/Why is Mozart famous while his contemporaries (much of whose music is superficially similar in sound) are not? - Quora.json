            "answer_text": "Aside from the fact that Mozart's music is usually simply better-crafted and more enjoyable than that of most of his lesser-known contemporaries, whether a layman listener subjected to an artificially constructed listening test can identify the differences on the spot or not, there are issues of basic marketing and economics to contend with.  While it isn't universally the case, most major orchestras and other performing organizations experience a significant boost in attendance, and thus in ticket sales, when they program works by big-name composers; they will often experience a drop in sales and attendance when a concert is programmed which does not feature any such well-known headliners. A large portion of the average symphony-going audience is what we musicians sometimes jokingly (and unfairly) refer to as the \"blue-haired\" crowd. These people would rather hear Mozart at his worst than Cimarosa or Gossec at their best, and since they tend to be regular attendees, the performers cater to them. It isn't really a just or noble state of affairs, since as you quite rightly point out, much classical-period music contemporary to Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven is of great value and is underrepresented in concert programming. But that's how the marketing works. On the odd chance that you do get some Salieri or Boccherini programmed, it's typically going to be alongside Mozart or Haydn.  Another practical issue to consider, though less important, is the management of orchestral repertoire and libraries. Orchestras, particular smaller ones, often try to keep their repertoires tight because it is costly and labor-intensive to try out new works by old composers that few in the audience are likely to recognize. Even where they are willing to take on new compositions by new composers, since this also offers a certain kind of crowd draw and is good for publicity, orchestras are not often nearly as willing to trot out a previously unrehearsed and unheard overture from the 1780s when they could just do Mozart 35 or 41 again. Much of this is also applicable to the classical recording industry, as you can imagine. ",

            "answer_text": "Haydn is strangely absent from your list, and Hummel, Beethoven, Schubert and several other very good composers started composing good music shortly after Mozart died. I would say Mozart\u2019s music is so well received today because he was so prolific and has written so many masterworks, and is a legend as a genius and child prodigy who wrote music perfectly the first time without ever revising it (at least not on paper, with no surviving records of any major reworking of pieces, such as in Beethoven). I only know of a few reworkings and re arrangements of Mozart, such as the Symphony #40 adding in clarinets and a few other arcane examples of reusing material. Historically, he is the person who popularized use of the clarinet family of instruments. He also contributed to the idea of the bohemian life of the artist/ musician, partying all the time, carefree etc. He was humorous and vulgar in some of his music, making him like a rock star. He hung out with Lorenzo da Ponte and a lot of wild, womanizing, heavy drinking guys. On a compositional level, his music is one of the richest in \u201cTopics\u201d or Topoi \u2014 semiological references to other types of music \u2014 dances, egghead counterpoint music, church music, peasant music, \u2014 you name it \u2014 it was like the first cartoon music rapidly changing. Themes for characters and moods and dramatic events. He paved the way for Wagnerian Leitmotivs and John Williams type film composing. He also had a lot of chromaticism and wrote in various styles (within the broader classical style). He helped create the standard forms of classical music along with Haydn and his contemporaries. Composers and Authors hyperbolized and sensationalized the relationship he had with Salieri as the years went on. On a pop culture level, the mostly historical (a lot of it accurate, but a fair portion made up) movie Amadeus made him the most popular historical classical composer before then. The soundtrack sold millions of copies. Even before that film his music was in a good deal of movie soundtracks. Lastly, his tunes are catchy, memorable, and easy to sing and whistle for the most part; usually it\u2019s happy, and when not, very emotional! I don\u2019t think I can say that about most other composers from his generation! ",
