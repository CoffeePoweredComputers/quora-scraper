            "answer_text": "Because unfortunately our society likes to build people up so that they can tear them down later. Billie Eilish wanted to be known for her talent not her body and that\u2019s her choice. But then she wanted to go to the beach and picked a bathing suit that sort of showed off her body as most bathing suits do, again her choice. Both good and reasonable choices as far as I\u2019m concerned. But unfortunately not everyone seems to think so and instead of thinking live and let live they need to become outraged that she wanted to wear a bathing suite at the beach. I guess in their minds she should have worn a sweatshirt and jeans to the beach. ",
