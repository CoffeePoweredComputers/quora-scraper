            "answer_text": "I\u2019m answering this question with my brand marketer\u2019s hat on. The problem of most artists is that they fail to standout from the clutter \u2013 and this is just the first step. Because most artists don\u2019t even get past this hurdle, they end up failing early on. I just wrote a piece on how one of my favourite artists has rebranded herself to standout from countless of female artists in the industry for her to breakthrough. Your efforts and investments will be wasted if you yourself haven\u2019t fixed this basic step. Clubs, promoters, and record labels are businesses who exist with the objective of increasing revenue. I\u2019m pretty sure they get hundreds of calls from aspiring musicians everyday, each one of them hoping to get their shot to be signed. You\u2019re just a speck of dust in this highly competitive industry, especially with the dawn of the digital age where it\u2019s too easy to consider yourself a musician. The 1st essential step to get noticed is to build your band\u2019s brand and establish a holistic marketing strategy on how you\u2019ll reach your listeners and potential fans through activities that will most appeal to them. These clubs, promoters, and record labels do not have the time and money to help you out with this aspect. THIS IS ALL UP TO YOU. Here are the three most basic steps for you to create a well-defined marketing strategy for your band: Identify how your branding as a musician \u2013 how would you package yourself visually? Take into consideration your genre, personality, and what appeals to your audience. I strongly believe that this is one of the most overlooked step in music marketing as most artists believe that as long as your music is good, you\u2019ll be able to do well instantly. No. This is not the case. Given how easy it is to produce and launch music, you need to stand out in this clutter by making your identity easily distinguishable from other musicians. Visualize how your sound/genre looks like if it is an actual person. Ask an artist to listen to your music and have them come up with something based on how they perceived your music. An example: This record label from Sydney called Future Classic does this artist branding impeccably. I love how each of their artists have their own distinctive character that suits their sound. An example would be the electronic producer duo Flight Facilities. Their songs are the type you would listen to when you\u2019re waiting in the airport at 3am. Thus the band name. They make sure this image is translated in their records, merch, and even live shows by injecting in aeronautical elements in these aspects consistently. What\u2019s good about Future Classic\u2019s roster is that each individual artist\u2019s genre are innovative in itself \u2013 very futuristic \u2013 but you are guaranteed that their songs will remain classic and timeless because they have ingrained themselves as pioneers of their specific genre. Know who your music is for. What is the profile of your audience/listeners? By identifying this group of people, it will be easy to shortlist the exact websites where you should post your music, as well as record companies you should approach as it will fit their demands given the supply you are offering. Not knowing who your music is for is like selling tampons to men \u2013there should be a specific product you are presenting to a certain need so that your resources \u2013 time, energy, money \u2013 will not go to waste. Identify where exactly in the digital realm you should be present. Know where your fans and potential listeners hangout online/purchase/stream their music. You can also check where musicians similar to you post their stuff. Once you have identified where these places are, I suggest sticking to just 2\u20133 channels and bombarding those with activities from your fanpage. I suggest you first concentrate on building your Facebook fan page as it is the most widely-used social media channel that can easily filter in your audience based on the profile you have set when you answered the question I posed earlier. If you\u2019re up for it, I can work on your branding as a musician for free \u2013 let\u2019s figure out how you should present/package yourself and determine who your target audience is and how you\u2019ll be able to reach them. Hit me up in this link, I\u2019d be more than happy to work with you free of charge. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Single toughest question in the music industry.  Essentially, it's impossible.  But after we overcome that, it's about honing your craft, becoming great.  I embrace the Gladwell idea of spending at least 10,000 hours, but the Justin Biebers of the world regularly disprove that thesis.   I recommend becoming a student of the genre you most closely relate to, not just listening what's out there today, but what came before.  If you like country music, learn about Hank Williams.  If it's pop, study Elvis.  Study hit songs to understand how they are constructed, and then WRITE, WRITE, WRITE!  When you have a base of good material, start performing.  Don't just sing into a webcam.  Perform in front of people.  Learn to command a stage.  Learn what to do with your hands and feet when you sing.   And when you're ready, book gigs in local venues.  Build a following, but even if no one shows except friends and family, keep at it.   When you are ready (and not sooner) prepare a great demo and spread it around on every website that means anything, including YouTube.  Call in every favor to find someone who knows someone who knows someone, and get into the room. Most of all, make sure you are doing it for the right reason...because you need to and not because you want to be famous.  Most people will fail at this, and if it isnt something you care deeply about, and need to do even if you dont become famous, then find something else and just perform on the side. I need to repeat this last point.  MOST ASPIRING MUSICIANS WILL NOT ACHIEVE FAME.  Accept that and then decide how much of your time, soul and heart you are prepared to dedicate to this pursuit. ",
