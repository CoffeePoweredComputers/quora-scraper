            "answer_text": "One way to deal with this is to simply sing some gibberish. Anthony Kidies of the Red Hot Chili Peppers did it quite a few times, here\u2019s an example:  Another way to deal with it, is just to repeat the lyrics of a previous/upcoming verse. And last but not least, you just sing something like \u201coh I just forgot the lyrics to my own damn song, on stage, how embarrising is that? Why do we even practice, what is the meaning of life anyway\u201d. This obviously wouldn\u2019t work on a sad, deep, ballad-like song, but will probably be even well received in an uplifting song. The most important thing is to stay cool and the crowd will always go with it, if they even notice. It\u2019s no big deal. One last way to deal with it just came to my mind: if it\u2019s the beginning of the song, you could just say something like \u201cno no no no, stop it, this doesn\u2019t work, I forgot the lyrics\u201d until the band stops (and everybody laughs) and restart the song or just play the next song, since you\u2019ll probably remember the lyrics a few minutes later. If you praticed and it\u2019s just a blackout, of course. If you didn\u2019t rehearse, then there\u2019s probably nothing to you can do\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I read that Barbra Streisand, in her comeback concerts, uses a monitor for the words. She\u2019s not really a touring singer. She did it for a few concerts because she didn\u2019t have confidence in her ability to remember under the pressure of a live performance. One axiom is Amateurs practice until they get it right. Professionals practice till they can\u2019t get it wrong. That\u2019s not a great consolation. If you lose your concentration because of some unusual event happening while you are on stage it is possible for even the most professional to go blank or lose their place. I can recall that experience on stage a couple of times. Once I repeated the first verse (after all it was a great verse). Most people never know unless they are very familiar with the song. If you are innovative you can do just about anything like launch into a story that the song reminds you of. Or while you direct the band to keep going you can do a analysis of what the words mean. ",
