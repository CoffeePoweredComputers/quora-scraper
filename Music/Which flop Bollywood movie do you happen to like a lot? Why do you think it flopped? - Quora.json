            "answer_text": "Which flop Bollywood movie do I happen to like a lot? Ah, this is a movie that I really love. I thought it was an amazing movie, and it totally captivated my attention. I must have seen it like a dozen times at least. I totally thought it was modeled after a Wong Kar-Wai movie.  Bombay Velvet is the name of this unfortunate film. While I personally loved the movie, it is considered as an epic monumental disaster by most.  I thought Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma were just splendid in the film - their chemistry together was crackling with electricity. Karan Johar put in a good performance as the sleazy businessman. The rest of the supporting cast put in fine performances as well (KK Menon, Manish Choudhary, Satyadeep Misra, Vivaan Shah, etc).  The music by Amit Trivedi was mellifluous, and, oh-so-entrancing. I can listen to Behroopia any day. Like I said, it reminded me so much of a Wong Kar-Wai film. The characters were memorable, and it felt just like life would have in the Bombay of yesteryear.  I find it a bit puzzling that apart from Anurag Kashyap, nobody else associated with the film defends the movie. Oh well, I guess the monstrous way in which the movie flopped has to do with it. It lost close to 70 Crores - it\u2019s budget was 120 Crores, and it only made 23 Crores during the first week. Inch by inch, I think it made close to 45\u201350 Crores in total throughout its tenure. I think future generations of movie viewers will be kinder to the movie, than they currently are. Why do you think it flopped? I think the overblown budget is the primary reason the movie flopped. Usually, big budgets like that are only recovered if the movie happens to be an action spectacle (Don or Krrish kinds of films). Bombay Velvet which was modeled after a Wong Kar-Wai type of film was never going to become a blockbuster. Perhaps, if they hadn\u2019t blown up their budget so lavishly, the movie would have worked better. But anyway, that\u2019s the movie that I totally love, but I think a majority of the movie going audiences and critics disliked. Oh well, at least there\u2019s two people who loved it - Anurag Kashyap and me. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Lakshya  This is the most beautiful movie which combines coming of age, youth, romance, war, patriotism and family values all in one, no one imagined a light hearted romance in the first half and a full fledged war in the second. I cannot under stand how such a masterpiece cannot be super duper hit at box office. The capable but aimless Hero Karan is capable, he comes from a good family, has a good girlfriend, loving father and mother, friends, what he is missing is a aim, focus in life.  His confusion depicted beautifully in the Song Mein aisa kyon hoon Karan\u2019s father who had lost his home in Lahore to the islmaic state of Pakistan hopes his son to find focus, his father knows how hard he has worked for rebuilding their lives and fears Karan may become too laid back in life. Pushed by his love and family\u2019s repudiation, Karan prepares and appears for Combined Defense Exam, he clears it and joins Indian Military Academy. Karan is not able to cope with training and runs off after punished for casual attitude by senior officer.  But when Romi comes to know of it , she breaks their relationship and leaves Karan as she does not want to be with a person who cannot have commitment.  From here the movie sets off beautifully as Karan returns to IMA on probation and excels in training to be a officer. The song \u2018Lakshya ko har haal mein paana hai\u2019 has become an anthem for millions of students, aspirants and people across the country.    Going through the Kargil attack by Islamic jihadis and Pakistan, we see Karan transform from a confused boy to a brave warrior who at the end wins the day, his love and respect of his father achieving his Lakshya (aim in life). The story is beautiful, inspirational and resonates with everyone in every field.  What makes the Movie stand out Inspirational songs \"Kitni Baatein\"Hariharan, Sadhana Sargam What a beautiful Melody \"Lakshya\" Shankar Mahadevan \"Kandhon Se Milte Hain Kandhe\" Kunal Ganjawala, Sonu Nigam, Roop Kumar Rathod, Vijay Prakash, Hariharan Ever connecting and relevant Scenes Karan returns on completing training and tour of duty, finds Romi had moved and is engaged to other guy. His eyes betray the pain since she was the one person he wanted to see him as a commited and focused person.   Later during the war which Romi is covering as journalist, Karan points to the peak which his team is tasked for recapture from terrorists and tells Romi that there is his Lakshya, the objective he was looking for his whole life.  Father son relationship Before the night of assault by his team, Karan calls his father and tells him how much he loved and looked up to him for all that he has done. His father tells him how proud he was of Karan and the man he has become, he tells Karan that there is not a single person in his circle whose son is fighting for the country like him. His father pours his heart since he knew his son might not come back.  Real characters Every actor and every character from legendary Amitabhji, Amrishji and Omji, to Sushant Singh, Sarath Kapoor, played their part to perfection.  Right philosophy The scene where a army captain chides Romi for talking about peace when their own country is under attack is masterpiece, an education for those who find even defense of country anti peace.  The culmination of the journey of Karan Captain Karan and his team with great sacrifice wins the peak but only Karan and two others return.     The conclusion   Captain Karan finds his love and life, and as we leave the story we realize how costly our freedom is because for every Karan who comes home, there are Captain Jalal and Captain Manjit who sacrifice their lives so that the country can live.   May be it failed because it was way ahead of its time and is now a cult film since later the audience realized the beauty and greatness of this film and the greatest performance given by Superstar Hrithik Roshan Jai Hind Jai Bharat Vande Matram ",
