            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll be using BTS\u2019 albums as an example. A single is a single track. An example would be Make It Right ft. Lauv. It\u2019s a single and there\u2019s no album with it.  A mini-album is an album but with less tracks. It can usually have up to 9 tracks. Love Yourself: Her and Map of the Soul: Persona are mini albums.   An album is just an an album. It might have up to 15 tracks on it. It could be EP or a studio album. An example is Love Yourself: Tear.  A repackaged album is an album featuring songs from older albums and some new songs. An example is Love Yourself: Answer. LY: Answer has 7 new tracks but the rest of the songs come from Love Yourself: Her and Love Yourself: Tear.  ",

            "answer_text": "Singles: one released song. Usually a title track in the album, if it released into an album, though. It\u2019s used as their main track promotion. Mini albums: it\u2019s actually the same as usual album. But only have like 5\u20136 songs in it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called mini. Albums: I am thinking you\u2019re saying it as a full studio album. A full studio album is an album where the track inside has around 10 or more songs. Repackaged album: a slightly different version of the original album. It\u2019s usually has same tracks inside the CD, with some adding few more songs and have a different title track to promote. ",
