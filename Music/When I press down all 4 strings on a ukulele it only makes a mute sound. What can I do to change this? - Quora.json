            "answer_text": "String are often muted by several things: You are not pressing down hard enough on the stringsYour fingers are not close enough to the back of whatever fret you fingers are onAnother finger is touching the wrong string and muting itWhen you have your desired chord shape, pluck each string individually to find out which string is causing the problem. Make sure you have none of the three problems listed above, then you should have a nice crystal clear sound. For barre chords, do not use the flat pad of your finger to barre a fret. Use the outside edge of your finger (the side closest to your thumb) to barre a fret. While you don\u2019t need your finger to be completely sideways, you definitely need it be slightly angled. Happy Strumming! ",

            "answer_text": "Simple. Press harder. See, it takes a bit of strength to barre on ukuleles and guitars, and if you don't press a string hard enough it won't make a sound, unless of course you're trying to do a harmonic. But there are rarely any people who have successfully barred all the strings on their first try. That's why you can play a single note, but it won't make a sound when you press down all four. Build up more strength, because your hand isn't used to barring. ",
