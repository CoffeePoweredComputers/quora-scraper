            "answer_text": "This is a bit hard to determine, because it very much depends on what you consider \u201chate\u201d and on what scale. For example, I\u2019m sure lots of people found Vanilla Ice\u2019s Ice Ice Baby to be all sorts of corny, annoying, bland, uninspired, mediocre, or just plain bad. That number has increased over the years as mainstream culture has warmed up more to hip-hop in general. But at the same time, it did have an appeal back then and even now some people may enjoy it because of just how cheesy it is. But Kanye West\u2019s Ye vs. the People probably got a significantly more negative reaction, partly because the lyrics and even moreso about the overall context in which it was released. It\u2019s also musically somewhat challenging, with the musical backup being just a few samples, with one (or maybe two in tandem) of them being looped throughout almost the entire track. However, there is one rap song that while functionally unknown (under two million views on YouTube), but has been universally ridiculed by whoever has listened to it (at least in the online circles I frequent), has been an absolute trainwreck called WHITEBOY, by Tom MacDonald. I can\u2019t even recommend it ironically, but it is quite an experience if you subject yourself to it; you know, like how watching 2 Girls 1 Cup is quite an experience. It has the dubious honor of being the worst rated single on the RateYourMusic database. ",
