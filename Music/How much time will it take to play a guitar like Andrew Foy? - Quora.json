A lot Im just an intermediate guitar player and i recall how long it took me to even remotely get \u201cnothing else matters (metallica)\u201dright. Its a basic fingerstyle song and took me almost a month to learn, i still make mistakes with it. There is no time period as such, you can learn much in a month or learn the same in a year's time. Interest and passion are the main ingredients. As per my experience you need to practice as much as possible. Andrew foy himself practices for almost 2 hrs daily, it says so in his you tube channel description. And you also need to learn how to read sheet music, a.k.a guitar tabs. This is really helpful in learning fingerstyle which is what Andrew foy plays on his channel. I suggest that you start with some basic fingerstyle songs like \u201churt\u201d by Johnny cash, and \u201chouse of the rising sun\u201d by the animals. Happy playing! And remember practice makes perfect ",
