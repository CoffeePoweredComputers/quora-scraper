            "answer_text": "Ariana Grande is a far superior technical singer. See comparison below. Ariana Grande Range: D3 - B5 - E7Vocal Type: Light-Lyric Soprano (4 octaves and a note)Vocal Rating: B- Positives: A vocal actress, being able to mimic the tones and voices of Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera and Celine Dion. Her lower register, though often weak and inconsistent (due to her high tessitura and breath support issues), is relatively strong for a soprano, supporting down to F#3 and extending to D3. Her belts are achieved through mixing, having stretched up to Bb5's successfully; Grande also has no issue staying in the soprano tessitura for extended periods of time (see live performances of Break Free, Dangerous Woman and Focus). Her belting register as a whole is extensive and reaches up to an impressive B5. Capable of complex, fast melismas (see Hands on Me and Problem). A rolling vibrato can be heard in belts up to G#5 and as low as Bb3. Her falsetto is light and sweet and is also where the voice finds its 'ring,' being bright and healthy up to Eb6. The whistle register is piercing, and the whistles don't have disconnected tones attached to them (polyphonic tones). She is able to sing vocal runs in this register (See Emotions). Negatives: The previously mentioned mixed belts generally lack power and the whistle register is not controlled (something she has admitted herself). Her slightly nasal and feminine tone is also polarizing. Her diction is unpolished, leaving her lyrics incomprehensible at points (see the bridge of Break Free) due to tongue tension. Grande also over activates muscles in her jaw - mostly while singing runs - furthering this tongue tension, which in turn changes the positioning of the larynx. Intonation live has proven to be a problem at points (around 2013), and the lower register sounds unsupported in most instances. Her support is also inconsistent, ranging from around G3-C#5, above C5/C#5 she raises her larynx. Selena Gomez Vocal Range: Bb2 - F#5 - C#6Longest Note: 10 secondsVocal Type: Lyric Mezzo-Soprano (3 octaves, 1 note and a semi tone)Vocal Rating: D Positives: A light, girlish tone can be found throughout Gomez's voice. A sweet, airy head voice combined with dark, healthy lows. Her chest voice gains a slight edge as she ascends, with ease in the fourth octave and ability to phrase in the fifth. The voice is cutting throughout each register. Negatives: Lack of vibrato makes the notes sound harsh, and the chest notes carry little to no power with them. Her stamina live is sub-par, and the voice can become nasal and whiny at points. Intonation proves to be a struggle as well, as she lacks solid support and connection throughout her voice. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cSinging\u201d more technically proficient/competent et al is ONE measure of a singer in our society - it\u2019s about entertaining us by picking the songs we want to hear and the overall presentation of the song (while it may be more obvious today, we have always preferred \u2018better looking\u2019 entertainers unless their voice was so amazing, that didn\u2019t matter). Look at when opera singers do \u2018pop\u2019 albums, they can hit the range on EVERY word but they are TERRIBLE versions. Meanwhile, Madonna has limited range but entertained us for 15 years through her song selections and antics. She amused us, that\u2019s ALL that counts. Or like Jessica Simpson, she actually is a technically proficient singer who can hit a bunch of notes but she has NO IDEA what she is singing about because she doesn\u2019t understand or believe in anything \u2026 she\u2019s a singer in one sense as she can slide up and down the scale and she can literally belt out songs in the right key but it\u2019s like asking Ethel Merman to sing STARDUST or Lionel Richie\u2019s EASY. Or the infamous Susan Boyle, yes, an excellent voice but there are literally a million vocalists as good who are more \u201ctraditionally attractive,\u201d but her story and arrival made people want to be on her side (aka: buy her albums as a gesture) \u2026 it\u2019s all part of entertaining.
