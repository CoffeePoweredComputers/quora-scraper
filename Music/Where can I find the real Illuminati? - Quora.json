            "answer_text": "Look for the original founders and progenitors of what the world has come to know as the Illuminati. Beware that there are many false groups that claim association to the name. These false groups are easily discernible from the real illuminati, who would have real solutions to real problems. The false groups have none. The real illuminati would have answers to the hardest questions that can be asked about human existence. The false groups have none. Those who claim to be the real illuminati would be stripped of pride and ego. They would not solicit for donations of any kind. Money would play no role in their intent to share the real truth with the world. A seeker of truth would only need to compare the knowledge and information that the real illuminati provide to that of the false groups to make a certain conclusion that they are who we claim to be. The goals of the real illuminati would be to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life, and the abuses of state power. Their intent would be to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice and to control them without dominating them. The real illuminati would know that religion has and is keeping the people of this world divided and in perpetual darkness, which continues to cause most of this world\u2019s problems. . The real illuminati would consist of the most educated and experienced people upon Earth. They would do nothing that benefits any individual member of their group. For this reason, those in their group would maintain strict anonymity. They would charge no money for the information that they provide. They would not solicit for donations. Neither money, power, nor popularity would play any part in their motivation. Their motivation would be to save humanity by helping to influence the creation of a societal infrastructure on Earth that serves the needs of each human, according to each individual's needs. They would have the solutions to all of humanity's problems. No one would be able to challenge the solutions that they propose; their solutions would work. They would know what has been responsible for the demise of humanity and also what was responsible for its success. They would attempt to save humanity from repeating history The real illuminati would exist to help us.  ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, you need to invent time travel. Then you will need to go back to the late 1700s. If you land in the year 1778 you could then join THE Illuminati. If you land in the year 1790 you will have missed them entirely. The following is from the Illuminati WIKI: Several recent and present-day fraternal organisations claim to be descended from the original Bavarian Illuminati and openly use the name \"Illuminati\". Some of these groups use a variation on the name \"The Illuminati Order\" in the name of their own organisations, while others, such as the Ordo Templi Orientis, have \"Illuminati\" as a level within their organisation's hierarchy. However, there is no evidence that these present-day groups have any real connection to the historic order. They have not amassed significant political power or influence, and most, rather than trying to remain secret, promote unsubstantiated links to the Bavarian Illuminati as a means of attracting membership. In other words, the Illuminati is defunct and anybody claiming to be such now is just a poser and quite possibly just after your money. ",
