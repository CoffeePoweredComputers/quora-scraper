            "answer_text": "Not exactly full song, but in many cases, it is the part of song/music, that gets stuck in my head Let me start with tom and jerry cat concerto episode. In that tom plays \u201cLiszt Hungarian Rhapsody 2\u201d. The part from 4:39 is my favourite.Tom and Jerry - The Cat Concerto Listen carefully, jerry tries to change the tune to \u201cOn the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe\". Infact you can say that second half of hungarian rhapsody 2 is one of my obsessions. Another tom and jerry episode, this time its kitty foiled, here scot bradley freely used Rossini\u2019s barber of seville overture, but at the ending, he made the music so \u2018dramatic\u2019 by rearranging the original and adding drum beats.Tom & Jerry & Kitty Foiled Best music & action ever - Cene of all time - epic Just compare it with original\u2026you\u2019ll see how genius the scot bradley person is\u2026. Gioachino Rossini : The Barber Of Seville - Overture This Scot bradley\u2019s edit of Rossini\u2019s barber of seville overture, I\u2019ll never forget in my life!! Johann Strauss II Die Fledermaus overture, another obsession.Vienna New Years Concert 2010, Die Fledermaus Overture, Johann Strauss Parts from 5:44 to 6:26 and 8:08 to ending. They are always in my ringtone and alarm list, no matter what others may think of me. Liszt Mephisto waltz, such a devilish composition, sends shivers through my spines\u2026Just listen to this devilish part between 8:15 to 8:35, ofcourse that danil guy did so many mistakes, but this part was extremely good. Liszt - Mephisto Waltz no. 1 in A major - Daniil Trifonov Some what good interpretation of liszt Mephisto waltz is here\u2026 Liszt - Mephisto Waltz No. 1, S. 514 [Andr\u00e9 Laplante] Just listen\u2026..the starting itself is awesome!!! Pokemon Oracion from darkrai movie\u2026..its so\u2026\u2026so simple yet induces plethora of emotions\u2026.even lugia theme is good.Pokemon Oracion ( Hoja Silbato ) Melody - lugia song Capeta no toushi\u2026..so inspiring\u2026..you'll get psyched up\u2026.Capeta Ost - 09 Capeta no Toushi Inazuma Eleven OST 15Inazuma Eleven - OST 1 - Soundtracks - 15 - Offici\u00eble wedstrijden Inabikiri fighter is also good Inazuma11 OST 2 - Inabikari Fighter So are OST 16 and OST 33 Inazuma Eleven OST - 1, piece 16 Soccer Battle Inazuma Eleven OST - 3, piece 33 Champions of the World \u201cUN owen was her OST\u201d in touhou project. Touhou has excellent sound tracks and this is one of the best. It is often mistook as death waltz by John stump. While both are impossible to play on real piano, this midi synthesized one is enjoyable.Actual death waltz is really\u2026death\u2026..okay\u2026. John stump created it just to troll musicians\u2026.many halfwits have gall to claim that this amazing composition below is death waltz!!!Impossible Piano Song - Death Waltz (U.N. Owen Was Her?) Some of Inuyasha OSTs are also quite bone chilling yet have some melody which enraptures out hearts\u2026..but remaining are just cheesy\u2026.of course what do you expect from Rumiko Takahasi with her borderline shoujo anime???Kikyo\u2019s death theme, always holds special place in my heart, All inuyasha kikyo themes are good. Inuyasha~ Kikyo's Death Theme \u3010FULL\u3011 ''Dearest'' Inuyasha- Kikyo Theme Kikyo - Theme - FULL Inuyasha -Longing Longing (Inuyasha OST. Flute Version) There\u2019s mononoke hime too, with that OST played by eagle bone whistle\u3082\u306e\u306e\u3051\u59eb - \u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30f3\u30d5\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8,Eagle Bone Whistle-Princess MONONOKE- Its already too long I will end this with ludocivo einaudi\u2019s musicsLudovico Einaudi - Experience Ludovico Einaudi - Elements \u2013 Live In London 2016 Ludovico Einaudi - Night \u2013 Live In London 2016 Ludovico Einaudi - Whirling Winds \u2013 Live In London 2016 Ludovico Einaudi - Primavera Everyone has their own special musics.

            "answer_text": "\u201cCloser\u201d by The Chainsmokers For some reason, I couldn\u2019t get this song out of my head! And I\u2019m talking about weeks of having this song stuck on an infinite loop. And I loved it more after each replay. This song is seriously addictive. I was so much in love with the song that I asked some of my friends to listen to it. And I managed to get all of them addicted to it as well. That didn\u2019t come as a surprise, seeing that this particular song has occupied the Billboard chart-topper position for a whooping 12 weeks! That\u2019s the second-best reign in the chart's 24-year history and the longest since 2005. And undisputedly, one of the most viral songs of 2016. I\u2019ve included the link. So do check it out. That is, if you haven\u2019t heard it yet (maybe, even otherwise. It\u2019s a great song!). You cannot miss out on this song. DISCLAIMER: This song is one of my all-time favourites. On the very rare chance that you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t blame me! ",
