            "answer_text": "It is worth knowing that the story was told in a non linear way where some skits are placed at the end of some tracks that make you feel the real starting of the story is from that track. But I take it to start from Compton. The 12th track on the album. The story starts at the end of Compton where he asked his mum to use her van for 15 minutes. The three tracks (The Recipe, Black Boy Fly and Now or Never) which come right after Compton played for exactly 15 minutes. These three tracks are just the new and present day Kendrick after he has reached stardom. At the very start of The Recipe, you could hear the van being drove by Kendrick. Right after that skit, move on to Sherane. The first track. So he borrowed his mom\u2019s van to go to Sherane\u2019s house. Sherane is his girlfriend. This story was about how he got to know Sherane and how desperate he was to sleep with her. He also talked about Sherane\u2019s cousin who he said is a notorious gangster in the hood. He got to Sherane\u2019s hood and saw the cousin. Just there his mom called to ask for the van. The story paused. Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe is just another track and not associated with story. At the end of it, he was instructed to join them in car by his friends. Backseat freestyle is just a him freestyling in the backseat of the car. On The Art Of Peer Pressure, he told the story of how he was influenced rather badly by his friends. He also talked about how they robbed a house in the neighborhood, got chased by the police but got lucky and escaped. His mom called again. Money Trees, is also just another that portrayed how Kendrick and his friends always hustle to get money. His mom called again to ask for the van. His dad sounds hilarious in the background. Now he continued the story the end of Poetic Justice, that's why you hear the Sherane beat on here. He was confronted by Sherane\u2019s brother and cousin. They threatened him by asking where he is from which is a very dangerous question to be asked in Compton. In the video to Poetic Justice, he got and got shot. That was when he realized he is a Good Kid, in a MAAD City. Good kid portrayed his as the nerdy guy in the hood where MAAD City showed how dangerous living in Compton can be. He told everything that happened to his friends and they gave him alcohol to calm him down on Swimming Pool. They were angry those niggas will \u201cstomp a nigga over a b*tch\u201d, then they decided to retaliate. Their friend, Dave got shot in a the process. Kendrick was so shook about this he became remorseful and depressed. In Sing About Me, 1st verse was Dave\u2019s brother blaming everything on the society which they were raised in. He asked Kendrick to talk about this when he makes it big later in life. Notice how the verse ended. \u201cAnd if i die before your album drops, i hope\u2026. *gunshots*\u201d This shows how living in Compton comes with no hope. Before you hope for something, you're killed. The 2nd verse was a story he told through the perspective of Keisha\u2019s sister. Kendrick told a story on Section 80 in Keisha\u2019s song, a girl who is more or less a prost. Keisha\u2019s sister is angry at Kendrick for talking about his sister on his album. This contrasts with the fact that Dave\u2019s brother wants those same stories to be told by Kendrick in the first verse. Also notice how this verse ended. The girl was angry at Kendrick and told him \u201cshe won't fade away\u201d as in, she won't die early but the verse was literally fading away when Kendrick was about ending it. She faded away after all. The third verse was Kendrick himself speaking about the two situations and telling Keisha's sister he had good intentions writing Keisha's song. Then later, Kendrick and his friends met Maya Angelou who thought them a prayer (the same prayer they recited without Maya\u2019s help at the starting of Sherane) and made them repent. Then on Real, he weighed in on the various definitions of being real. He came to the realization that \u201cbeing real\u201d is not by shooting in the neighborhood and killing a man, but rather, \u201cbeing responsible\u201d. Then his mom called him to tell him Top Dawg has called the house so he could come to the studio for a record deal. Then on Compton, he went to the studio, recorded with Dre and he was a new man, Kendrick Lamar no more K Dot. \u201cNow everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar.\u201d At the end, he asked his mom for the car and the loop starts again.

            "answer_text": "This felt pretty appropriate to answer since I'm listening to the album right now. good kid, m.A.A.d. city is Kendrick Lamar's non-linear narrative of growing up in Compton, California, a city notorious for its crime rate and high gang activity. I can speak from first hand experience of what Compton is like, I used to take two trains to get to USC everyday and I would pass through Watts and Compton twice a day. It's not as bad in certain places, but it's certainly no place to spend a Saturday night.  But anyway, Kendrick starts out as a typical girl-crazy teenager thrust in a world of drugs and violence. The album is sprinkled with several voicemails from his mom and uncle, which help chart his evolution from angry adolescent (which is what m.A.A.d. stands for: my angry adolescent divided/my angel's on angel dust, which is why Kendrick doesn't smoke) to an adult shaped by his experiences in Compton.  I think it's about the influence of being born in Compton and rising above the violence and drugs to become someone better than the product of his environment.  Also, the album cover is a picture of Kendrick and his father.   Meaning of m.A.A.d.:Kendrick Lamar Explains Meaning Of \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" Title, Reveals T.I. Collaboration ",
