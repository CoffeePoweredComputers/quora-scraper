            "answer_text": "Music can inspire such strong feelings and bind us so tightly to other people. \u201cMusic affects deep emotional centers in the brain, \u201c says Valorie Salimpoor, a neuroscientist at McGill University who studies the brain on music. \u201cA single sound tone is not really pleasurable in itself; but if these sounds are organized over time in some sort of arrangement, it\u2019s amazingly powerful.\u201d How music makes the brain happy How powerful? In one of her studies, she and her colleagues hooked up participants to an fMRI machine and recorded their brain activity as they listened to a favorite piece of music. During peak emotional moments in the songs identified by the listeners, dopamine was released in the nucleus accumbens, a structure deep within the older part of our human brain. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal, because dopamine is released with biological rewards, like eating and sex, for example,\u201d says Salimpoor. \u201cIt\u2019s also released with drugs that are very powerful and addictive, like cocaine or amphetamines.\u201d There\u2019s another part of the brain that seeps dopamine, specifically just before those peak emotional moments in a song: the caudate nucleus, which is involved in the anticipation of pleasure. Presumably, the anticipatory pleasure comes from familiarity with the song\u2014you have a memory of the song you enjoyed in the past embedded in your brain, and you anticipate the high points that are coming. This pairing of anticipation and pleasure is a potent combination, one that suggests we are biologically-driven to listen to music we like. But what happens in our brains when we like something we haven\u2019t heard before? To find out, Salimpoor again hooked up people to fMRI machines. But this time she had participants listen to unfamiliar songs, and she gave them some money, instructing them to spend it on any music they liked.  Valorie Salimpoor, McGill University When analyzing the brain scans of the participants, she found that when they enjoyed a new song enough to buy it, dopamine was again released in the nucleus accumbens. But, she also found increased interaction between the nucleus accumbens and higher, cortical structures of the brain involved in pattern recognition, musical memory, and emotional processing. This finding suggested to her that when people listen to unfamiliar music, their brains process the sounds through memory circuits, searching for recognizable patterns to help them make predictions about where the song is heading. If music is too foreign-sounding, it will be hard to anticipate the song\u2019s structure, and people won\u2019t like it\u2014meaning, no dopamine hit. But, if the music has some recognizable features\u2014maybe a familiar beat or melodic structure\u2014people will more likely be able to anticipate the song\u2019s emotional peaks and enjoy it more. The dopamine hit comes from having their predictions confirmed\u2014or violated slightly, in intriguing ways. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a roller coaster ride,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere you know what\u2019s going to happen, but you can still be pleasantly surprised and enjoy it.\u201d Salimpoor believes this combination of anticipation and intense emotional release may explain why people love music so much, yet have such diverse tastes in music\u2014one\u2019s taste in music is dependent on the variety of musical sounds and patterns heard and stored in the brain over the course of a lifetime. It\u2019s why pop songs are, well, popular\u2014their melodic structures and rhythms are fairly predictable, even when the song is unfamiliar\u2014and why jazz, with its complicated melodies and rhythms, is more an acquired taste. On the other hand, people tend to tire of pop music more readily than they do of jazz, for the same reason\u2014it can become too predictable. Her findings also explain why people can hear the same song over and over again and still enjoy it. The emotional hit off of a familiar piece of music can be so intense, in fact, that it\u2019s easily re-stimulated even years later. \u201cIf I asked you to tell me a memory from high school, you would be able to tell me a memory,\u201d says Salimpoor. \u201cBut, if you listened to a piece of music from high school, you would actually feel the emotions.\u201d How music synchronizes brains Ed Large, a music psychologist at the University of Connecticut, agrees that music releases powerful emotions. His studies look at how variations in the dynamics of music\u2014slowing down or speeding up of rhythm, or softer and louder sounds within a piece, for example\u2014resonate in the brain, affecting one\u2019s enjoyment and emotional response. In one study, Large and colleagues had participants listen to one of two variations on a Chopin piece: In version one, the piece was played as it normally is, with dynamic variations, while in version two, the piece was played mechanically, without these variations. When the participants listened to the two versions while hooked up to an fMRI machine, their pleasure centers lit up during dynamic moments in the version one song, but didn\u2019t light up in version two. It was as if the song had lost its emotional resonance when it lost its dynamics, even though the \u201cmelody\u201d was the same.  Ed Large, University of ConnecticutPeter Morenus/UConn Photo \u201cIn fact, when we debriefed the listeners after the experiment was over, they didn\u2019t even recognize that we were playing the same piece of music,\u201d says Large. When playing the more dynamic version, Large also observed activity in the listener\u2019s mirror neurons \u2014the neurons implicated in our ability to experience internally what we observe externally. The neurons fired more slowly with slower tempos, and faster with faster tempos, suggesting that mirror neurons may play an important role in processing musical dynamics and affecting how we experience music. \u201cMusical rhythms can directly affect your brain rhythms, and brain rhythms are responsible for how you feel at any given moment,\u201d says Large. That\u2019s why when people get together and hear the same music\u2014such as in a concert hall\u2014it tends to make their brains synch up in rhythmic ways, inducing a shared emotional experience, he says. Music works in much the same way language works\u2014using a combination of sound and dynamic variations to impart a certain understanding in the listener. \u201cIf I\u2019m a performer and you\u2019re a listener, and what I\u2019m playing really moves you, I\u2019ve basically synchronized your brain rhythm with mine,\u201d says Large. \u201cThat\u2019s how I communicate with you.\u201d Source: Why We Love Music ",
