But Thai modern music sounds like this     (Thais like kind of easy-listening, rock and pop-rock music) If you mean traditional music, it sounds like this..    So, I think modern music might not sounds different much. (Filipinos have more solo artists in their music industry. Maybe?)But in the case of traditional music, I don\u2019t know about Filipino music before colony era. So Filipino traditional music in Latin style will different from ours for sure. ",
