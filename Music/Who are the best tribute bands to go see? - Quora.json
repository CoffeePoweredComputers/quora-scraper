            "answer_text": "The band, ZOSO, are the absolute best Led Zeppelin tribute band I\u2019ve seen. ..and I\u2019ve seen a few. Whenever ZOSO comes to town, I\u2019m there! And it just so happens I\u2019ll be seeing them on 9/07, in Cleveland. But, they tour many of the U.S. states. All Zeppelin fans should go to www.zosoontour.com, and check out their tour dates. The ticket prices are very reasonable (ie: this time around, I paid $14 each for general admission), and it\u2019s always an Amazing show! As a long-time, dedicated Zep fan, I can say that these guys sound the closest to the real thing. Other Zeppelin tribute bands I\u2019ve seen which don\u2019t even come close to ZOSO\u2019s talent, include \u2018Get The Led Out\u2019, \u2018Led Zeppelin 2\u2032, and \u2018Lez Zeppelin\u2019. Do not waste your time or money on these ones. In fact, \u2018Lez Zeppelin\u2019 is just a farce. They\u2019re a group of chicks who try to look tough, and scream a lot, etc. -and, sure, the concept of an all-girl, lesbian tribute to Zeppelin might sound interesting, but really, their novelty wears off within a few minutes. And, just between you & I & the rest of the internet, none of em are halfway decent looking, so what\u2019s the point?? Bottom line: If you consider yourself a Zeppelin fan, you\u2019ve gotta see Zoso. NOTE: I do not work for, or personally know any of the Zoso entourage. All of the above is purely because I\u2019ve seen them perform in various spots around Cleveland, about 14 times, so I know they f**kin\u2019 rock, and I keep coming back to see em again. Amen. lol.
