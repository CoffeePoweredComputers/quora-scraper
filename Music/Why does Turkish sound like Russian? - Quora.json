            "answer_text": "Turkish is not similar to Russian actually. But I understand this view of foreigners. First, both languages are sharpier than English. For example British people doesn\u2019t say or slighty about some consonants like as \u201cR\u201d. Turks say R truly but is doesn't sound like soft American R or as hard as Russian R. Secondly both languages\u2019 harmony a bit monothonic. For example Spanish and Greek have similar own musical harmony but Turkish hasn\u2019t got like this. Some vowels are similar for example Turkish dottless \u0131, close back unrounded vowel\u2019s nearly equvalent also found in Russian. Russian sounds sharpy also to Turks. Turkish has more soft sounds and also has more vowels I think (tukish wowels are a, e, \u0131, i, o, \u00f6, u, \u00fc). And also Turkish hasn\u2019t got much consonants than Russian\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "That is an interesting observation. Here is mine. When in a hospital for a couple a weeks, I shared room with an Azeri man. He talked over phone from time to time and I had opportunity to learn a bit of phonetics of his language. My summary: I noticed no sounds or their combinations which would be difficult to reproduce for a Russian speaker. Azeri and Turkish are very similar (but not equal) in phonetics. Russian speakers can clearly hear all separate sounds when Tayip Erdogan is on TV\u2026 ",
