            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s look at this objectively. Most people would probably rank their vocals as: RoseJennieJisooLisaHowever, this ranking is subject to a lot of controversy due to Blackpink\u2019s recent 4D MR removed. In that performance, Rose\u2019s voice sounded unnaturely strained while Lisa actually sounded the most stable. Many people tend to blame YG for \u201cruining\u201d Rose\u2019s voice by making her sing in a \u201cunique\u201d way. You can judge this for yourself by comparing her predebut clips to her current clips, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about now. Rose clearly demonstrated her vocal prowess in performances like the one on Masked Singer or Irreplaceable Duo, but in live performances with Blackpink her vocals often sound strained. In fact, in live performances Jennie is often the most stable and I believe that her vocals are healthier than Rose\u2019s. Her voice never cracks and has a very unique, fierce tone to it as well. Jisoo never really struck me as a vocal powerhouse until her performance of Clarity at the Blackpink concert, in which she hit many high notes (but cracked a few). Her voice is very thin and husky, and isn\u2019t as powerful as Jennie and Rose\u2019s. So, I would say the best vocalist is between Jennie and Rose and it\u2019s really up to you whether you like Jennie\u2019s powerful tone or Rose\u2019s honey-rich tone. However, I would say that Rose is probably the best vocalist because she has shown that she can sing much better than the others, but only when she is in good condition, which she isn\u2019t in often, sadly.
