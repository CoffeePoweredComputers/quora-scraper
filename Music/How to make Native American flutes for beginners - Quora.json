            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not really sure if I understand the question, but\u2026 If this is a \u201chow to build a flute if you\u2019re a beginner\u201d kind of question, you may want to start with the tutorials here: Crafting Flutes | Flute Craft - instead of branches or lumber, a person can use hollow bamboo pieces. A Native American Flute requires three elements: somehow accurate ratio between the bore size and length; unique sound mechanism and pentatonic tuning. Once these elements are in place, you get a Native American flute. Every amateur woodworker can build a NAF once he learns about basic measurements and shapes of the sound mechanism. And even if you\u2019re not a woodworker, with some patience you can use simple handtools to create the instrument. If this is a \u201cwhat Native American flutes are good for beginners\u201d kind of question, then the answer is even simpler - every NAF works well for beginners. But I suggest to start with a flute in the key of A (A4). Bass flutes or high-pitch flutes require the player to utilize more breath control, while the popular keys like A, G or F#, well, they require less breath control. Other things, like the type of wood, are irrelevant. A NAF is a very simple instrument. ",
