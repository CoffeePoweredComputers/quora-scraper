            "answer_text": "Its totally different, All SNSD releases were Singles followed by EP's that contain many songs. All SNSD song to this day ammount +150 songs as a group (Including TTS and Oh!GG releases, and without repeating their other language version songs) Blackpink has to date just 16 songs, At 5 years of their debut (Without counting versions of the same song) When SNSD had 5 years of debut they already had 47 songs (Without even counting their Japanese versions of their songs) 2.9 times more than what Blackpink has in the same amount of time. Blackpink has few songs, It's a fact, not even an exaggeration, SNSD had way almost 3 times thier discography in the same amount of time. Don't lie to yourself, Blackpink HAVE few songs. Even BLINK keep on demanding YG to have the girls release songs. This is not to say though that it is bad, because is their marketing technique, to make the songs something rare and limited. ",
