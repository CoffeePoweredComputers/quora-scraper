My friend Despacito (The Music Track by Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee) has crossed over 6.7 B views. And there are lots of videos on YouTube which have crossed 2 B views. Like ( Lean On - Music Video By DJ Snake and Major Lazer). And If your question was about non-musical videos, then I'm sorry for that. ",
