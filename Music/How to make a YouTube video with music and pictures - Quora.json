            "answer_text": "1. Click on the Windows \"Start\" button in your taskbar. Type \"movie maker\" into the Search box. Click on the \"Windows Live Movie Maker\" shortcut when it appears in the search results. Download and install a free copy of Windows Live Movie Maker from the Windows Essentials pack, if your installation of Windows didn't include the program (see Resources). 2. Click on Movie Maker's \"Add videos and photos\" button. Select the images you would like to use in your video, using the file explorer window that appears. Drag and drop your images in Movie Maker to sort their order. Click on the \"Add Music\" button to import your audio file into Movie Maker. 3. Click Movie Maker's \"Project\" tab and click on the \"Fit to Music\" button beneath the tab to stretch the image's display duration to match the length of the audio file. 4. Click on the blue \"Movie Maker\" button. Highlight the \"Save Movie\" option in the drop-down menu that appears and select one of the output presets from the sub-menu that appears. Because your project uses an image for the video track, you can select the \"For email\" preset to output the smallest possible file with Movie Maker. 5. Enter a name for your video into the \"File Name\" field in the file explorer window that appears and click on the \"Save\" button. Your project will begin rendering into a single file. Click on the \"Close\" button. 6. Click on the \"YouTube\" button under Movie Maker's \"Home\" tab. Select the desired resolution for your video from the menu box that appears. Sign in to your YouTube or Google account, using the fields in the Publish to YouTube menu box. 7. Type a title, a description and tags into their respective fields in the Publish on YouTube menu box. Click on the \"Permission\" box to set your video to either \"Public\" or \"Private.\" 8. Click on the \"Publish\" button to begin uploading your video to YouTube. ",
