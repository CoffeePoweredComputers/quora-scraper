            "answer_text": "If your objective is to learn to play the piano, get the NP-12. It has a full keyboard of 88 weighted keys. The PSR-E353 is only a 61-key keyboard, and not weighted, but \u201ctouch sensitive\u201d. That PSR is a \u201ckeyboard\u201d, and really more of a toy than it is a piano. I\u2019ve played some Yamaha PSR keyboards, and the keys are rather slick and just don\u2019t feel right. I own a higher-end Yamaha, and it doesn\u2019t feel all that much different than my acoustic piano. It sounds pretty good too since they use \u201csampled\u201d sounds from Yamaha and Bosendorfer acoustic grands. There is a pretty sizable difference in price, however. The NP-12 has a MSRP of $499 but you can get one for about $450 from many online retailers or a large musical instrument store. The PSR-E353 is a lot less expensive, and you can pick one up online or at \u201cbig box\u201d retailers for about $180, but six months from now you might not be happy with it. With either one, don\u2019t forget that you\u2019ll also need a stand, a good sustain pedal (not the cheesy one that comes with it) and a bench. ",

            "answer_text": "I dont know if other folks know exactly what is a Yamaha NP 12 \u201cpiaggero\". Ive been using yamaha keyboards several years and I have good tracking on thier models. Yamaha NP12 doesn't have 88 keys only 61, even the higher model NP32' has only 76 keys and they are not weighted keys. Although yamaha put something like \u201cGraded Soft\" which is essentially harder silicon bed placed on lower notes keys. What the NP 12 has over psr E 353 is a better sounding piano sample. But for me PSR E353 has far more features than NP12. Not to mention it has Yamaha Educational Suite (YES). Also the PSR E 353 is an arranger keyboard, so it has a lots of fun to play with. If you are in doubt with my answer check this review about YAMAHA NP 12. Yamaha NP-12 review ",
