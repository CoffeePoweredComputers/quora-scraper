            "answer_text": "This is complicated, so please bear with me!! In many (mostly American) interviews, Min Yooni (Suga) has mentioned his dreams of a Grammy nomination. It became somewhat of a meme in the fandom, but a lot of ARMYs were ready to make that dream a reality. So, once nomination season came, Twitter was absolutely flooded with #BTSxGrammys, #BTSGRAMMY, etc. A lot of people, including myself, wanted their nomination, but were ready to face the fact that it probably wouldn\u2019t happen. Once nominations were officially announced, the Love Yourself album series\u2019s packaging was nominated for best package. So, to answer your question, technically, yes!! I hope our boys win, the albums and all of the extra goodies the physical copies come with are very much worth a Grammy :) I hope I answered your question!! ",
