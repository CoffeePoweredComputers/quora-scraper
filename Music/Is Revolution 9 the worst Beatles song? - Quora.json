            "answer_text": "Remember, \u201cRev 9\u201d isn't a song. It's a track. That's an important distinction to make in discussing its merits. There are Beatles songs I despise to be sure. From John Lennon, \u201cDig A Pony\u201d is the most insipid, lacklustre piece of nonsense song he ever put on a Beatles album, mostly due to him being in a heroin stupor during the ill-fated GET BACK sessions and bringing not too much in the way of substance to the table. Conversely, my least favourite Paul McCartney song stretches back to the PLEASE PLEASE ME period: \u201cHold Me Tight.\u201d I'm not expecting \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d or \u201cPenny Lane\u201d in these early days, but there's always been something about this tune that makes my skin crawl. Even Macca didn't quite know where he was going with it at first, so it was left off of PPM and thrust onto WITH THE BEATLES. This song brings the entire album down for me, I dislike it so much. I can't say I truly dislike any George Harrison-written or sung songs too much (I suppose \u201cI\u2019m Happy Just To Dance With You\u201d and Hassa\u2019s own \u201cBlue Jay Way\u201d aren\u2019t too high up there), but \u201cI Wanna Be Your Man,\u201d \u201cWhat Goes On\u201d and \u201cDon't Pass Me By\u201d are Ringo Starr tunes that are tolerated, not enjoyed. Some Beatlemaniacs generally don't care for \u201cMr. Moonlight,\u201d \u201cYellow Submarine,\u201d \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\u201d \u201cMaxwell's Silver Hammer\u201d and \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden,\u201d but I like/love \u2019em all. I can't say the same for \u201cWild Honey Pie\u201d or \u201cWhy Don't We Do It In The Road,\u201d however. So either \u201cTight\u201d or \u201cPony\u201d get my vote for worst Beatles song. But worst Beatles track? \u201cRevolution 9\u201d is eight minutes and fifteen seconds of unlistenable noise that John should have kept to himself. Or for his solo albums. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. But of course it is only what I think. Maybe there are other fans that like that. Anyway, that is not a song. Can\u2019t be considered a song. Very bad indeed. AndI love avant garde songs. I love what they did for Tomorrow Never Knows. Revolution 9 is boring and also scaring. Besides, there is a person who was not a Beatle participating and probably that is why that work is so awful. After all she never had talent. I am talking about yoko Ono. But there are other \u201csongs\u201d she did with John that are even worse. Two Virgins is worst. Life with the Lions, or something like that is also worst. Besides it is also has a sad story behind it. Paul disaproved it. But while he was away John broke their agreement for the first time. Before that it would be enough one of them to disagree for them to accept the negative. It was an oral agreement. But, maybe thanks to Yoko, John broke it. What a sin. It marks the beggining of the end. Sometimes I think that song has something from the darkness on it. Because the album released in Brazil had a serious problem. Out of tune. It was impossible to listen to the D side. The song Revolution was totally problematic. Some silly fans believed that was on purpose. The Beatles had decided to record a song totally out of tune. They do believed that. I didn\u2019t. I knew something had gone wrong. Fortunately Side A B and C were good. Later Odeon admitted it was a mistake they made while recording it here. I do feel it was the bad vibes from Revolution 9. Odeon never gave our money back. And we had to buy another album if we wanted to listen all tracks. ",
