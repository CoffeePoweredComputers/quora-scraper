            "answer_text": "Vocal range does not correlate to voice type. Voice type refers to where your voice sounds it's most resonant and full (often referred to as your tessitura). Anyone can train lower or upper notes beyond their tessitura, but there will always be an area (usually about one octave) where your voice sounds it's best and where it's easiest to sing without really trying. Don't get hung up on voice types if you're singing modern music. Voice types are only important if you're singing opera because they separate voice types based on tessitura for specific roles. Hero = tenor. Protagonist = baritone or bass. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on whether you're male of female, and it depends on the range you're most comfortable and feel natural when singing. B2 to E6 is too wide a range, and it may probably only represent the highest and lowest note you can sing. If you consider your middle range, you're probably a contralto if you're female, and a tenor of you're male. ",
