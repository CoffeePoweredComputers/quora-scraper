            "answer_text": "YES. Being raw, unpolished and exuding a rustic charm is one thing, being blatantly sexist is another. And if you understand enough punjabi to get the meaning behind his songs, you'll know what I'm talking about.   The brilliant Mr. Singh The first time I was introduced to the wonderful fare that Mr Singh had to offer was by virtue of a song titled \u2018Choot\u2019. I was of the opinion that the name of the number was enough to scandalize me but had no clue as to what the lyrics had in store. The horror that was unleashed upon my being once Yo Yo Honey Singh started belting out profanities that I had almost never heard of before was unparalleled. The sheer explicitness of the composition was as disturbing as it could possibly be and was nothing but an insult for the XX chromosome. Females in his songs are nothing but sex objects where he raises questions about their character and tries to teach them a thing or two about morality. Ironic, much? A particular song of his says that no boy would ever look at a girl because the color of her skin was not exactly brown while another may almost force someone to think of herself as a total loser because she was someone who could easily be taken for a ride (both ways). Honey Singh has no qualms in labeling the woman as \u2018desperate\u2019 and asking her the price that she would demand for a romp in the bed with his esteemed self. Why is it that the man is always right and the \u2018kudi\u2019, a whore?    Let me quote some lyrics from his song, Brown Rang (Brown color, in english, which is used to refer to the skin color of the girl in question.)  \"Excuse me Miss, kis kis kis kiss se tu bhaagi giHun bach bach ke, tenu rab ne husn ditta rajj rajj ke\" \"Excuse me miss, how many kisses are you going to run from,Trying to escape. God has been generous in granting you beauty.\" Now just because a girl is pretty, she has to kiss him or something. I mean sorry, but what shit is he professing?   \"Urre aa tenu ik gal samjhawan, maade purje nu kade hath main na paawanVaise taan mitran da bahut vadda score but white chicks naI don't like them anymore, bann mitran di whoreI mean mitran di ho\"  \"Come here, let me explain something to you, I never touch anything sub-standard.By the way, I've scored many times, but only with white chicks.I don't like them anymore, come be my whore.I mean be mine, ho^^^\" What the absolute fuck?    So now the question says, 'Are Honey Singh's songs demeaning to women?' I mean are you kidding me? This guy doubts if the girl gets her daily supply of the newspaper only because she refuses to recognize him. He predicts with a lot of confidence that the girl who dumped him will end up marrying a loser and her future will only involve washing his undergarments and doing the dishes. Is this NOT demeaning? (On a completely unrelated note, I am sure this guy got dumped really hard. My congratulations to the girl who did that. No, really!)    So while summing up this answer, I'd like to offer another perspective. His songs are horribly profane, but it is the reaction to it that makes it profound. Let me explain: When people dance on his tunes (which I have to admit are pretty catchy) they are NOT dancing to the lyrics in the song. Hell, most people can't even understand enough punjabi to know what he's trying to put across. Last but not the least. there are people who have the sensibility to judge, people who listen to his songs and forget them; but then again there are others who will think it is cool to do what he's famous for. Small wonder, Honey Singh has become a sort of 'youth-icon' in today's world, which is probably the stupidest thing ever possible. Then again, let us know who to blame for what. Please do not exaggerate anything to various pathetic proportions. Honey Singh is sexist, but NO, he is not responsible for rape.   Honey Singh and the Delhi rape case. And well, because my posts are deemed incomplete without something funny. EDIT: One thing here, that I feel deserves to be said. You can take offense from anything and everything. Innocent remarks and not so innocent remarks, if you so wish to. Honey Singh's music is very very sexist and yes it is demeaning to women. Which is the one line answer to this question. I have elaborated on why I feel so, but then again I feel this huge hue and cry and all this rage surrounding him is really unreasonable. If you listen to Eminem's songs and are okay with that, then please stop being a hypocrite and crying yourself hoarse about how you are 'offended' by Honey Singh's songs. ",

            "answer_text": "Why blame Honey Singh? There was always a demand for such songs or ideas because this mentality exists in many of us. Well you may disagree, and argue that its honey singh to blame for all that is wrong and demeaning to women. Its easy to blame one person for all that is wrong in the society. There are so many artists on internet, so many songs and yet you play honey singh. I mean come on... just because he has got good beats makes you accept the shit he says. Then its you not him.  Many other artists have done it before. Its a easy and tested formula to get attention that can convert to material benefits. Remember the song CHO**, the first time you heard it was just out of curiosity. You dint even care the quality of music. Thats how it was and thats what they aim for. To say some weird taboo shit that no one else says gains easy attention (can be fame or shame). And in INDIA, where such songs get to mobiles of every single guy (remember song sutta or sabka katega?), it was meant to be a hit.  Cheap songs? I call it a good strategy to get popular. Look at lyrics of songs today, its a new trend.  How to get rid of it? 1. Don't listen to honey singh, even if its good on beats. 2. Tell your friends, so they wont play it near you. 3. Talk about it, tell your friends or family why it is not a good song. Convince them that just because its packed well doesn't mean you should eat shit. Your elders will be there to support you, so would the girls and suddenly you are in majority !!!4. keep earphones handy. use them when needed.5. don't go to the movies that involve such songs (everything boils down to money). and tell (on twitter especially) why you are not going.6. Keep hope, don't think whatever comes on TV is what the society is. All of this shit is paid to be broadcasted. even your fav music channels (tv and radio) are sold out. ",

            "answer_text": "Misogyny has a been a part of hip-hop culture always. Not just Honey Singh. Even the popular western artists are hugely misogynist. What I don't understand is the double standards of evaluation Indians follow. Not that I'm justifying honey singh. I believe Honey singh's songs are blatant insult to women and I don't like listening to them.  What I'm concerned is how people adulate rappers like Eminem  Pitbull, Snoop Dogg and on the other hand criticise Honey singh for being Misogynist. When I searched quora with keyword  'Eminem' , results include why Eminem is great rapper, how are Eminem's lyrics so creative?etc etc. And for honey singh , why is he such a misogynist, Is he spoiling the culture of Punjab, Is honey singh responsible for rape??( rape? really?) Consider, \"KILL YOU\" by Eminem , oh my god!! The lyrics is really offensive, With constant use of words like Bi***, wh***, slut  and many other lines that I don't want to mention here at all. People justify the lyrics by saying he had a rough childhood , and that's the reason he writes such lyrics!! How could that be a valid reason. Consider Enrique's \"I'm FU**ING YOU\", it's a classic example of sexual objectification of women. Objectifying women is so common in Indian movies. Consider \"Munni Badnaam Hui\", \"Jalebi Bai\" etc. What I'm trying to say is that Honey singh is not the only culprit, It is lot of other celebrities who been demeaning the women through songs and movies. A lot of people who listen to such songs never care about the lyrics. It's only the adrenaline filled music they are interested in. ",

            "answer_text": "Alright this is my first answer in Quora I'm just gonna give a try.First of all, I think Yo yo Honey Singh is just doing what he enjoys . I mean he likes to rap and a lot of people here ( dont know if its right or wrong but just generalizing) , have a common misconception about the genre of rap. Rap is not about being misogynistic or racist or something like that. Its about being able to tell people (other rappers) that \" Yo i am better than u in this this.. and this\" i mean more about showing your superiority over others and simultaneously maintaining clever rhymes.Nowadays maybe it has become more of bragging in an awful way. (I know saying \"I fucked this girl and that girl\" does not make you any superior than anyone)but,  I know there lot of rappers not just Honey Singh who talk a lot about women explicitly in their rhymes. But, its just their point of view and the genre is such that the words are pushed far beyond than the limit( set by general public or whatever), so people take it offensive or even personal.I dont think he or any other rapper is misusing their freedom of speech or something like that. Yeah, there can be more clever way of showing your superiorty over others which many good rappers do , but its just part of the game and if you take it to heart just because Honey Singh or someone says something sexually about women then its ..... I don't know. And when the Delhi rape issue took place, the fire was already there and when Honey Singh said something about women then that was the spark and people starting blaming him. I think at that time (for example) if I would have publicly stated that I dont like women or something that I felt, people would have taken my opinion in the form of disrespect against women. Its just my opinion and I Don;t understand why do people need to take it personally. If you dont like the song then you shouldn't listen to it. And for the record, I haven't listened to any of Honey Singh's song (just listened to Brown Rang before answering) and its just another song. So its all about how you take it. There are songs which people emotionally connect to and there are chill out songs or club hits which are recorded just to have a cool , chill out feeling. You need to learn to differentiate and stop taking everything seriously. Get over it. ",

From guys who could literally make any and all rings, ellipses, hyperbola and parabola of the puff smoke to guys who could dance elegantly even after scores of bottles down their throat to guys who are currently in I.S.R.O to who are entrepreneurs. Variety of them. Since I do not smoke or drink, I never could understand aspects of it. But one thing that I found common in all of them was they always hid from their family members that they smoke, they immediately doused the smoke seeing a professor, ran for cover when saw a girl coming. This was never because the secret would be out but because they had some 'etiquette'  and 'respect' which came out of tradition and our culture. Unlike West ( I DO NOT WISH DISRESPECT, just difference) our families don't sit together and have beers! So, just because something is there, doesn't means needs to be explicitly mentioned. Yes, people do talk in such language, \"choot\" etc are common in boys hostel, but never ever a guy speaks in such profanity in public especially when elders or women around. Is is our parents don't know what happens in  hostels ? Don't they know boys watch porn ? Just because they do know, does it means boys would be now watching porn with their fathers ? NO! So all those who go by the logic it's there, please let it be 'there' not in open. Coming , to Yo Yo ji, either  he was really brutally thrashed by women or took being dumped pretty pretty seriously. For him, at least by his songs, women are nothing but piece of 'object' meant for men to play!none of his songs are complete without bringing women in them, that could point to one thing, that had not women be there, who would have know Yo Yo.Whatsoever, be the case, what I find ironical is that Bollywood town  who every now and then uproars to feminism, paved way and glorified a guy who literally rapes women's dignity in his songs!

That's what the people in our country like listening to. We might proclaim or boast about gender equality in our Country touching base in every aspect. But some sections, and that includes teenagers like us as well, who love those songs, and 'rap' them day and night.  And it is not only Honey Singh, even renowned and proclaimed actors like Akshay Kumar do things which shouldn't be done on national TV or cinerma. For e.g : his pinching of Sonakshi Sinha's navel, in the movie Rowdy Rathore. And it is not only Akshay, there are other actors as well. There are scenes being continually showed in Indian Cinema which demeans women.  But again, you can't just blame them. It is the public who like their crap time and again, and those artists just deliver what the public likes listening to. They are just being professional. ",

There are already tone of songs in Bollywood which would objectify women and won't even bother. Whole industry is creating supplies for the need. People don't want to listen to music which is a artists perception about something , his vision. It is just about making money. They have tried and tested methods that people ( well majority's mindset) will like. Not every one would stop and try to get what artist has to say. Some good songs are discarded just because they lack tempo. WTF. I mean rhythm is different but tempo. Rap is also very misunderstood genre in music. Intact every music genre is misunderstood. I am just saying about me and what I think of music . For me its whats inside a musician's head. Early rap was from low life people and were simply fad up from life. So they would rap about it. About the abusive lover, about drunk father, about broken bones , pending bills, crime, killing , drungs and all the horrible things they see every day. And that's what left there is just what's bad. (I find blues striking similar to rap, blues was also played by same people and were singing and playing ng about their life.)In honey sings's world the only thing matters is 4 bottle of vodka, and chasing girls or make girls chase him. I would not listen to it because I listen to music to which I can connect to. I can listen to a rap about going through a fall and coming back. But not 4 bottle of vodka. ",

For him, girls r lyk sex dolls and it may b somewhat acceptable that boys like his songs. But shame on girls who r fan of him. 3 yrs ago i entered in colg and some guys were listening his songs balatkari . After listening the lyrics i jst strted hating honey singh. Now i don't listen his songs even if i like the music. It's not bad fr only youth but for small kids also they r learning vulgarity and abusive language at very small age. I think people like him should hav no right to live in India. He is a rapper but frm mind he is a raper. And dear girls if u like him plz listen to his albums which he made in starting of his career i'm sure your mind will change. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Hip Hop is artistic expression, generally centered around not-so-subtle humor about sexuality. Exhibit A - \"I like big butts and I cannot lie\" 2. It puts sexuality out in the open, which is where it belongs. The problem with branding any form of non-violent expression as something against the will of the society is the typical \"Don't think about the pink elephant\" problem, which is why banning books doesn't work ever. By suppressing sexual expression, society is own-goaling. 3. It is not Yo Yo Honey Singh's responsibility if someone rapes a girl. Rape Scenes in movies are just that, scenes. If a person commits an act of sexual assault after being influenced by hip hop, that person needs jailtime, mental treatment, and possibly death. but it's still not the hip hopper's fault. ",
