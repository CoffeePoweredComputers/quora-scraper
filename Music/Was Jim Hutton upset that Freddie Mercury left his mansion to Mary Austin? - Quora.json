            "answer_text": "After reading several articles , and watching many videos , I am not so sure he was as upset as some say . If anyone knows anything about Freddie Mercury , the name Mary Austin is not one that would be overlooked or unheard of . She and Freddie began before Queen was ever formed . Freddie who had enrolled in art school and had been in a handful of bands , chose the route of becoming a musician . He and Mary became a couple , had moved in together , and for a brief time , while Freddie had a booth at a market , Mary was the one who was the main source of income that supported them both . Once Freddie has made it big with Queen , he returned the favor and Mary and he remained very close even after their break up, for the rest of Freddie\u2019s life . However Mary was not the only one who lived with or was a permanent fixture so to speak in Freddies life . Joe Fanelli , one of Freddies previous boyfriends , also lived with both Freddie and Jim in Garden Lodge . Even though he also had Aids , he helped care for Freddie in his last days , dying himself only months later . As for Jim , when Freddie was diagnosed with the Aids virus , upon telling this news to Jim , gave him the option of leaving him . However , Jim responded that he loved Freddie and wasn\u2019t going anywhere . As the years went by Freddie purchased Jim , who was a native of Ireland , and Jim\u2019s Mom a plot of land and a cottage . He also gifted Jim witt the the lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody , Mr. Nice Guy . his jacket from the Wembley concert , a car , and a half a million pounds . Mary did get most of Freddie\u2019s estate , but somehow I doubt that would of been a secret to Jim , as he and Freddie also unofficially married each other , wore matching wedding bands, that they were later upon their passing cremated with . Since Freddies passing , so much information has been put out there . Some true , some misconstrued , and some was just flat out wrong , but it sold papers and boosted ratings of the talk shows . Among some of these stories it was reported that Jim and Mary no longer spoke to each other . that even the remaining members of Queen no longer spoke to Mary since the death of Freddie . Then in other videos , there was Mary saying quite the opposite that they did still speak . I have even seen interviews with Brian May where he freely acknowledged that Mary was the love of Freddies life . As for the truth of Jim and Mary , I am sure it was anyone\u2019s guess and the only two who know for sure is Jim and Mary . I am sure tensions were high when Freddie passing . No one is ever ready for someone they love to die regardless of how it occurs . There may even been some words spoken in haste that were later forgiven or maybe not . Later when Jim returned to Ireland , I am even more sure that if there was any upset, that it was more of , leaving behind 7 years of memories and moments he and Freddie had shared . It would be like finally fully coming to terms with the fact Freddie was really gone . That could not have been easy . I am just of the personal opinion, that I find it hard to believe with everything that occured , that it ended with Jim and Mary at odds . I am more leaning sort of towards one last story to sell , milking it for all it was worth before at last closing the book . Regardless of the validity of all the stories , Jim Hutton passed away in 2010 , and Mary lives her life pretty much out of the view and scrutiny of the press now , and rightly so , as she has more than earned it .

            "answer_text": "I think he was, although I believe he was aware before Freddie died that Mary would get Garden Lodge, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise. I read Jim\u2019s book, and it seemed he was most upset at being told by Mary that he had to move out of the mansion by March of 1992 (Freddie died in November of 1991). He expected to be able to stay there longer, but Freddie never made any written provision for him to do so. Mary had a husband and young son at the time, and she was pregnant with her second son. Freddie intended Garden Lodge to be a home for her family, and said that it was what he wanted. To be fair, Mary tried to talk Freddie into leaving the mansion in trust instead of to her so that it might be turned into a museum someday, but Freddie refused to go that route. His view seemed to be that if circumstances had been different, he and Mary would have gotten married, and she would have inherited all his possessions anyway. Although Freddie loved Mary always, he preferred men sexually, making it impossible for their romantic relationship to sustain itself. My guess is that Freddie felt guilty about hurting her for the rest of his life, and wanted to try to make up for it in a sense by providing her with a home. Mary feared it would be difficult to make GL her personal residence, and she was right. To this day she is sometimes still hounded by tabloids and fans as she goes about her daily life. I even read that the makers of \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d (not sure who specifically) wanted to film scenes inside the mansion, and she said no. She has given a few interviews over the years, but for the most part she is extremely private. Those who saw the film will note that there were no real life pictures of Mary and Freddie in the credits, although there were pictures of Freddie and his parents as well as Freddie and Jim, Freddie and the band. My assumption is that Mary preferred her picture not be shown. As for Jim, I don\u2019t think there was any love lost between himself and Mary. It makes sense that there would be jealousy there as they were both in love with Freddie until his dying day. Freddie did leave Jim 500,000 British pounds in his will, so Jim was able to go back to his native Ireland and build a new home there. He died from lung cancer in 2010. ",
