Lots of syncopation.Vocals: in an age of vocal acrobatics, I love how subtle and \"calm\" his singing is.Lead guitar: his lead lines mimic his vocals - subtle, calm, relaxed (just compare Clapton's solos with Cale's in that video). Another unique characteristic is his use of other scales outside the normal blues scale in his soloing. Sounds much more modal (a little Mark Knopfler-esque IMO).",
