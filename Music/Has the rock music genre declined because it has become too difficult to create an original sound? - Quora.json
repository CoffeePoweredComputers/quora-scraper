            "answer_text": "Rock 'n' roll is around 70 years old, and inevitably by this time so many melodies, riffs and lyrical themes have already been explored. However, this does not mean that the genre is doomed to decline from here on out. There are an inexhaustible number of ways that artists can give their own twists to themes that have been visited before, perhaps mixing and matching. The roots of pizza, for example, go back hundreds, maybe thousands of years. Yet a pizza eaten today is just as delicious. Robert Plant has said that everyone borrows from everyone else. It's hard to disagree with him. Sometimes this borrowing is blatant (Creed from Pearl Jam; Greta Van Fleet from Led Zeppelin, etc.) and sometimes it's more subtle. The roots of rock music today can be traced back to several prominent ancestors: Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Who, Buddy Holly, The Beach Boys, The Byrds, Hank Williams (a country artist, but he had an outsized impact on rock), Bo Diddley, Little Richard, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and others. Their musical DNA, along with that of many more, has mingled to produce today's rock music. Going outside of rock music to the field of country for a second, the vast majority of the new acts of the last thirty years have been just as influenced by the Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd as by George Jones and Merle Haggard. So, later generations can change the course of a genre and influence it going forward. A hundred years from now, long after we're gone, someone will probably hear a Chuck Berry song and want to pick up a guitar. She or he will give the music their own spin and perhaps go on to inspire others. ",

            "answer_text": "I think this is an important part of the reason, though not the only reason. Some previous movements in rock, such as 1970s punk and 2000s pop punk, were quite back-to-basics in their nature. And with the stagnation of music-making technology at the turn of the millennium, there\u2019s plenty of retro-sounding music in the other genres. Look at how much disco-influenced pop we have had this year. As for other reasons, in the 1970s, dissatisfied working-class youth did not have access to sampling and drum machines. So the easiest way for them to create a musical outlet for their dissatisfaction was to form a rock band. Although it did not happen overnight, rapping has now become the easiest way to form an outlet. Computer production has become as easy and accessible as buying and learning to play a guitar, and has the added advantage in that you can do it on your own. There\u2019s also the fact that any genre is likely to have a shelf life in terms of being popular. If rock is following the trajectory of jazz, then rock is in the same position jazz was in the mid-80s, about 65 years after it first became popular. By that time, jazz was quite clearly no longer part of the cultural zeitgeist. Furthermore, it had also stagnated artistically, a contrast to the first half of the 1970s. As one answer to another recent question put it, while we usually expect teenagers to rebel against the music of their parents, it\u2019s actually when a genre becomes the music of their grandparents that it really loses its footing.

            "answer_text": "That is part of it yes. Think about it, we\u2019ve had the original rock of the 50s (modified Rockabilly) followed by folk rock, British Rock, glam Rock, psychedelic rock, latin rock, funk rock, progressive rock, art rock, country rock, Album Oriented Rock, punk rock, pop rock, metal and all it\u2019s strains, college rock, alternative rock, and then in the early 2000s you had bands going back to the basics of the original rockabilly. So yes, everythings\u2019 basically a retread of earlier styles by now. Of course, if we\u2019re honest, many people who call themselves \u201crock\u201d fans don\u2019t really want to hear anything \u201cnew\u201d or bizarre. I mean\u2026Greta Van Fleet. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re bad; but they are stunningly un-original. Yet they\u2019re one of the biggest selling rock bands out today. That does not bode well for bands that ARE trying something original if all people want is endless variations on the Stones, Zeppelin or Who. Of course, one of the problems is our brains are wired to respond in a certain way to the music we listened to during our teenage years. No really, it\u2019s a fact, read this linked article! So that\u2019s the other problem. You will NEVER respond to new music they way you do to the music you grew up with because it\u2019s bonded to you, regardless of how many Greta Van Fleets, Struts, White Stripes, and Hives come out of the wood work.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start off with the premise that \u201cthe rock music genre has declined\u201d, as there are still vital regional markets and venues for so-called rock music, and so the \u201cdecline\u201d is more in the market percentage rather than a complete wipe-out. One might even posit that the music has \u201cgone underground\u201d. One could also posit that the fundamental shift in \u201cpopular music\u201d has to do with technology, as currently it\u2019s the \u201cone man/woman band\u201d; the producer\u2019s studio being housed in someone\u2019s bedroom; the \u201cband\u201d being a mass of samples or computer generated loops. So . . . saying one genre is in decline or even \u201cdead\u201d, reverts to what people have been bemoaning about the state of jazz for quite a while. It\u2019s more like DNA or the genes have been passed along, so you can say so-and-so looks like jazz but of course it\u2019s not jazz\u2019s grandpa (the exact same person). The grandpa might have gone to the great hereafter but the son/daughter live on in the specifics of their era. Listen closely! Clearly, rock has had an influence, simply in terms of \u201csonic energy\u201d on that market juggernaut we call hip-hop, a genre which surely does NOT sound like it sounded in 1980-whatever. ",

Now I'm not talking about indie labels which you may be able to get some kind of a signed deal (maybe not for big money but for producing an album.) But the major labels - it seems like for the last 25 or 30 years will turn away rock groups and say \u201cwe really like your stuff but you're not doing rap hip hop or r&b\u201d. I suffered through that scene in Los Angeles through the late eighties - for me it was all right because I'm still an indie producer/creator anyways, and I wouldn't be able to stand having a record label tell me how to do it. Now there are resources for Indies and if you get creative and look around online for dream pop and shoegaze music you'll find it's actually quite a huge scene and there are tons and tons of really clever brilliant bands all over the world creating beautiful Rock music. There seems to be no end to the variety of songs and styles that can be created. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it declined because the genre moved in directions that aren't interesting. This doesn't mean nothing modern is good, but it's generally stuck in one of two places: 1- effectively a cover band, ie, originals that aren't original. 2- fireworks and complexity over substance. There is no doubt that musicians are equally as talented as musicians of the past; the sticking point is the they just aren't as creative or willing to take risks. There has also been a general death of original live music, at least on cities that aren't Los Angeles. When there is no local support, there is no ecosystem to test music and ideas. Look at any of the more popular music today. You can easily tell what decade rap, pop, EDM were created. You don't even have to be a fan of this stuff to make a good guess. In the past 10 years, you can easily confuse rock for some decade past. I truly doubt there is no ability to create something new. ",

Rock does, however have to compete in a changing media landscape which currently seems to favour other genres, some of which prioritise \u201cfame\u201d over originality. The other problem that's been around for years is that record companies are less inclined to nurture rising talent. They want a hit. NOW! And they want money for their shareholders. NOW! We no longer seem to have labels like Charisma, Island or the early Virgin records whose owners were just glad to take a punt on something interesting. I doubt that Tubular Bells would get a release these days. ",

Also a lot of rock that used to be edgy is now mainstream or been there done that ( gretha, foo fighters ). You can get louder but then it becomes metal. You can experiment more but that will make it experimental music. The album Pink by Boris was the last time I thought; that is an interesting turn. And the last cool rock band with hits was kings of leon who quickly became less cool. Maybe the psych movement with thee oh shees, ty segall was also intetesting. It stayed small which is ok. Maybe some cyberpunk music willl be made. Return to roots I dont see that happening because all roots have already been returned to. So the future of rock n roll doesnt look good.

There certainly has been some originality, and those who brought it were sometimes rewarded \u2014 but not always. For every Peter Gabriel there have been a raft of Bruce Springsteens and Bryan Adamses and John Cougar Mellencamps. The big changes, that is, the big spikes of originality, have usually come from other genres \u2014 R&B, funk, even New Wave (though most of that wore off). The changes rock could claim for its own, like punk and grunge, are mainly reversions to rock\u2019s own roots. ",

There are a list of boxes that a song or artist has to tick to be rock, the decline has more to do with new genres fitting new sound better than rock could. Most modern music has roots in folk and classical, but we don\u2019t call them by either of those words because there\u2019s been whole new categories created to better suit what they\u2019re creating. Making original sound is the easy part, calling it rock music is where it gets difficult. ",

But it\u2019s still basically 3-chord blues progressions, sometimes with country, jazz or gospel elements. In over 70 years, most things have been done. This isn\u2019t to say that some innovator won\u2019t come along and break some new ground, but it\u2019s definitely more difficult to be original with the back catalogue of the genre behind you. ",

Rock dominated the scene for almost 40 years, I'd be surprised If It were still dominant. Second, rock was most popular when people could DANCE to It. Unfortunately that hasn't been the case for almost two decades now. Rock has become a music for white teenagers who can't dance. Rock definitely needs to find its \u201croll\u201d again. ",

The current situation doesn't help and the talent shows producing cheap plastic music and performers who don't last ,rock music takes time and effort and groups need time to move forward and develop and of course tour it builds the audience and inspires creativity.

But one never knows. Also the younger generation has Rap, Hip Hop, etc., and \u201cYoung Country\u201d for lack of a better term, is very popular as well. There are just more genres and sub-genres to pick from than there were in the past. ",
