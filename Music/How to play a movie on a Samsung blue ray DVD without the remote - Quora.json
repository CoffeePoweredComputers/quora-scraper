            "answer_text": "In some cases if you look along the front of the blu-ray player you might find a flap somewhere that unfolds, this will be hiding some of the basic buttons required to play the blu-ray. I know Panasonic usually do this and it\u2019s so handy when you can\u2019t find the remote! Failing that if you look in the pound shops they usually sell some kind of \u201cuniversal remote\u201d which will allow you some basic functionality without purchasing a new genuine remote. If you want most of the remotes functionality back then look for universal remotes made by a company called \u201cOne For All\u201d - they are more expensive than the cheap pound shop universal remotes and are usually found in bigger supermarkets or on Amazon rather than pound shops, but they are much better quality than the cheap ones, and some of the more high end One For All remotes can also download the codes from the internet or learn from other remotes if they aren\u2019t fully compatible and the customer service team at One For All are great at finding the best remote if you go on their website and start a live chat with them - Home | One For All Failing that you could always contact Samsung and see if they are able to sell you a replacement remote or look on eBay for a genuine samsung remote - this will give you the most compatibility however the samsung remotes will be a lot more expensive than the universal remotes.

            "answer_text": "Just about any inexpensive universal remote can be set to control your Samsung Blu-Ray player. Another alternative - some Android-based phones (e.g., Samsung, LG) have a built-in IR transmitter. With that, you can download any of the many free remote control apps and use your phone as the remote when needed. To determine if your phone has an IR transmitter, look for the small window at the top edge; it might be difficult to see, but if you use a protective case, the case itself will have a cut-out where the IR beam would be.
