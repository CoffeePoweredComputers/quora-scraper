            "answer_text": "No. I agree with Joe Sheffield\u2019s remarks in his excellent 2017 book Dreaming the Beatles, which just joined my shelves of Beatle tomes after I devoured it in a two-day binge (and which I\u2019ll review if anyone asks me to): McCartney doesn\u2019t seem to have a religious bone in his body. He\u2019s not even slightly bothered by the idea that there may or may not be a god, whereas Harrison eagerly embraced religion and Lennon anxiously wrestled with it in his early solo career (cf. \u2018God\u2019 from Plastic Ono Band). McCartney plays with mild religiosity in something like \u2018Let It Be\u2019, but he seems to have been more than satisfied with a family, a farm, his work and the love of a spouse. No detectable transcendental longings at all. ",

Most British people are not very forward about their religion and around half of us don\u2019t have any. Nothing I\u2019ve read suggests to me that Paul is religious. His song Let It Be sounds like a hymn, but is actually based on a saying his mum (called Mary) used. ",
