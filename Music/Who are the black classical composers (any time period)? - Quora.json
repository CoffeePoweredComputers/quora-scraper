            "answer_text": "Starting in the late 1800's and moving forward the most well known included Samuel Coleridge Taylor (not to be confused with the reverse-named poet of course) the British black composer, then in the US,  William Grant Still, and to some degree Nathaniel Dett, though more of his work would be considered light classical or parlor music as it was then called. More modern and still working (spent a lifetime at Princeton) would be George Walker, and currently Alvin Singleton seems to be getting a great deal of attention. These are just a few who were well known enough to encounter in the process of a fairly standard musical education. ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to the composers already mentioned I would add three: Harry Lawrence Freeman (1869 - 1954)  The first African American to write an opera, Harry Lawrence Freeman began composing opera after hearing a performance of Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user. He founded the Negro Grand Opera Company in Harlem, and composed at least 23 operas including two four-opera cycles in the mode of Wagner's Nibelungen cycle featuring black characters, and wrote his own libretti.  Maurice Arnold Strothotte (1865 - 1937)Born the year the American Civil War ended, Strothotte was a student of Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. He incorporated African American folk music into his compositions, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k is even purported to have borrowed from Strothotte for his famous Humoresque. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k singled out Strothotte as \"the most promising and gifted\" of his American students.  Will Marion Cook (1869 - 1944)  Critic Alex Ross, in his book The Rest is Noise, writes that Will Marion Cook \"forms a direct link between Dvorak and Duke Ellington.\" Like Strothotte, he was a student of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k ",
