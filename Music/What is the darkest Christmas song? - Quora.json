(1984) The lines in question: The only water flowing, is the bitter sting of tears OK, yes - this is a charity single - we\u2019re meant to feel bad about poverty in Africa. Sure, I can deal with a bit of darkness in there. We\u2019re just talking about how bad life is for some people - it\u2019s not like we\u2019re gloating about how good our lives are in comparison\u2026 Tonight thank God it\u2019s them, instead of you. Ouch.  The Pogues Ft. Kirsty MacCall - Fairy Tale of New York (1987) You scumbag, you maggot, you cheap lazy faggot Merry Christmas your arse - thank God it\u2019s our last. It\u2019s my favourite Christmas song - but there\u2019s no doubt about it, these guys are terrible people.  Various Artists - Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside This is basically a song about a guy pressuring a woman (who is trying to leave) to stay with him. Particularly notable lines include: Say, what\u2019s in this drink? Oh so we\u2019re cool with essentially drugging people so they stay with you now? What's the sense in hurting my pride? Pretty manipulative, bud. And so on and so forth.  ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \u201cdark\u201d. If you mean sarcastic, I would nominate Tom Lehrer\u2019s Christmas Carol\u2014although the song is sixty years old, and Tom\u2019s satire of Christmas commercialism has lost some of its bite in these days of Black Friday sales and customers fighting each other over Tickle Me Furby Xbox Hatchimals, or whatever it is this year. It\u2019s hard to satirize naked greed when it\u2019s become so normalized; audiences in 1959 were a bit more shockable:  On Christmas Day you can\u2019t get sore,Your fellow man you must adore,There\u2019s time to rob him all the moreThe other three hundred and sixty-four. . . If you mean existentially depressing, I\u2019m going to echo at least one other poster and suggest Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s 7 O\u2019Clock News / Silent Night, which manages to be a very dated artifact of August 3, 1966, and at the same time sound painfully timely.  Nixon also said opposition to the war in this country is the greatest single weapon working against the U.S. If you mean just plain black, I\u2019m partial to the tracks on Jul, the 2005 EP by the Thuringian pagan-metal band XIV Dark Centuries. \u201cBragarful\u201d is a pretty good sample. It starts out as a nice medieval-ish acoustic folk song about celebrating Yule with firelight and mead and all that. . . and then suddenly, shredding guitars, death growls, and blastbeats kick the doors in:  Das heilig Horn es geht im Kreis von Mann zu MannEin jeder hebt es, ruft die G\u00f6tter ehrend anDann hallt der Ruf aus hundert Kehlen durch den HainWotan!Wotan!
