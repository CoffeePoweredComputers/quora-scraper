            "answer_text": "No. The word has different meanings depending on the style of music and the era. When phonograph records first came on the scene, each individual song was sometimes called a track. This was because the needle that etched the sound into the vinyl master could well be described as a \u201ctrack\u201d - like a track an animal would make. These songs were recorded in mono (not stereo). When Les Paul invented \u201cmultitracking\u201d Multitrack recording - Wikipedia, the artists could record first one track, usually bass and drums at once, then \u201coverdub\u201d the second track, which might be vocals, or piano, etc. As tape technology became more sophisticated, more and more tracks could be put on a tape. Typical formats: 2-track stereo, 4-track (Sargent Pepper\u2019s!) Reel-to-reel systems use tape that is 1\u20444, 1\u20442, 1, or 2 inches (6.35, 12.70, 25.40, or 50.80 mm) wide, which normally moves at 3 3\u20444 or 7 1\u20442 inches per second (9.5 or 19.1 cm/s). Right before the industry went to digital (all 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s) the 2-inch 24-track format was pretty standard. Then, when rap and hip hop came along, tracks took on a slightly different meaning. Musicians would compose what we called \u201cmusical beds\u201d that rappers could then improvise over. These \u201cbeds\u201d were often called \u201ctracks\u201d and much of the musical material came from\u2026ready?\u2026old vinyl records that the DJ would manipulate by hand, grabbing bits and pieces of 1, 2, 3 second musical thoughts, then mixing them in with their own musical ideas. And little by slow, DJ\u2019s left the radio station and (via Jamaica) came out on the dance floor. This music is mostly referred to as EDM, or Electronic Dance Music. I\u2019ll stop here, lest I loose track of my train of thought\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Music is recorded on separate \u2018tracks\u2019. In the old days, there was only ONE track called \u2018Monaural\u2019. Then two called \u2018stereo\u2019 to simulate a 3\u2013d effect. Then came recorders that could overlay more than one track besides the original. In the early 60\u2019s an analog 4 track recorder was state of the art, but was very limiting excepting some very clever manipulations to combine tracks that won\u2019t be changing. Analog mixers and recorders eventually got to where they could have 24 tracks or more. In the digital world, the number of available tracks are almost limitless. So to answer the question, music is recorded and produced on tracks regardless of how they are mixed together in the final form. There are some purists that still aim to get good sound with one microphone and single track recorder. ",
