            "answer_text": "Gone by Kanye West feat. Consequence & Cam\u2019ron. The song starts off with a verse by Kanye, and the rhymes start off clean and nothing that is stretched too far. Lots of rhyming on the same beat continuously. The chorus is also very smooth and clean with a down to earth, straight, and simple beat. The lyrics also add to the slickness that is felt while listening to the chorus. Then Cam\u2019ron comes in with his verse. This verse has a lot of rhyme on the \u201coooh\u201d sound and it becomes constant. The downbeat is very clear in this verse as it is always on the \u201cgone\u201d. It also helps that Cam\u2019ron\u2019s voice is very smooth and liquid-esque. Then Consequence comes in with his verse and once again there is a lot of similar rhyming. His voice is also clear and smooth, continuous and clean. You can always feel the beat at the same tempo. Then at the end Kanye comes in for another verse. It is smooth for the same reasons as his first verse. It\u2019s constantly flowing and is not abrupt or unexpected. ",

            "answer_text": "Nelly-Just a dream Mike Jones-5 years from now Snoop Dogg-California roll B.o.B.-John Doe These are songs I thought that could count as \"smooth rap\". However, Lil Dicky's new hit Molly is one of my favorite rap now, and Imma give the honor of the smoothest rap song to Molly.  I think I called it \"the smoothest song\" not just for its soft rhythm or melody, it's about the lyrics. Every piece of word is so delicate, I even cry at certain places in this song every time that I hear it. And the music video is awesome, too. It's a song that really makes me emotional and sensitive (but in a positive way). ",
