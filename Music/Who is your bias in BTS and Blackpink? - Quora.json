            "answer_text": "See i cant actually chose a bias since all are my biases..but since you asked me to be specific..here they are( sorry my wifi is a bit down so I can't attach pics and videos at the moment) BTS In BTS my bias is Taehyung - he is really funny, amazing, sarcastic, sings amazingly, dance is another level. Namjoon- He is an underrated member but he is the one whole held them together in 2018 when they were on the verge of breaking up. He is an amazing leader. He works really hard to write their lyrics and organize stuff. He was called ugly but he still performs well as always working hard for his band. BLACKPINK Here my bias is Rose and Jennie Jennie- people always criticize her as \u201cYG\u2019s princess \u201d \u201crude\u201d \u201clazy dancing\u201d and other stuff. But she still remains strong though she is constantly criticized and made fun of for being one of the more promoted members of Blackpink. She is always constantly made fun of but she remains strong and brave.NOT to mention she is an amazing idol and she is hella flexible dancer\u2026her vocal ranges are amazing. She is a good cook too. She has been in various ads and music videos even before her debut. She is a brand ambassador for various luxury brands the most famous one being Chanel. Rose:-She has such amamzinggggggg vocals. She can take various pitches and ranges with her voice. She has one of the best body shapes among the k-pop idols. She looks so beautiful. Also she is a very kind and amazing person.She is also a famous model for the brand YSL St.Laurent. I love all the members but they are my favorites\u2026( I tried to attach photos but it didn't work so I\u2019m really sorry) So no hate, please. Also to everyone reading this, please stop calling out on Jennie ",
