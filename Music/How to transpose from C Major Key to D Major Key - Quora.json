            "answer_text": "Since D major and the D major scale is one whole step above C major (and the C major scale) you could write either the bass part (if there is one) or the soprano part (if there\u2019s a \u2018melody\u2019) first. You will notice that in order to render a melody or another voice part from one key to another there are strict relationships that must be maintained between the source/original key (C major in this example) and the target/transposed key. That is, in order to provide a one-to-one correspondence between the source key and the target key the notes will need to modified/altered so that the result (i.e. newer key) is an exact copy with the only difference between the two being the original or first note that the piece starts with. Transposing from C to D involves recognizing distinct differences between most of the notes of the two scales. C major - All notes are played/sung using no accidentals. These means all notes are played as if each note has a \u2018natural\u2019 sign appended to the note. c\u2019 - d - e -f - g - a - b- c\u2019\u2019 . D major - Only five notes are played/sung using no accidentals. The third and seventh notes of the (d) scale employ an f# and a c# respectively. d\u2019 - e - f# - g- a- b - c# - d\u2019\u2019. Thus the relationship of the scale wise pattern in terms of distances between each successive note in the scale is identical. Distances between each successive note of the scale can be termed intervals or steps.In both of the scales shown above the intervals or step distances are as follows:whole - whole - half - whole- whole - whole - halfOr, 1 - 1 - 1/2 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1/2 . Some music writing software will affect a transposition between keys. Otherwise it can always be done \u201cby hand\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "C major key signature is empty, no sharps, no flats, nothing. D major signature is F# and C#.D is two half steps up from C.So whatever you have in C major can be transposed to D major by rising two half steps. When you rise E you\u2019ll get F# and when you rise B you\u2019ll get C#. This is the C major scale: C - D - E- F - G - A - B This is D major scale: D - E - F# - G - A - B - C# Sometimes you may find altered notes in a song written in C major. Just rise two semitones. For instance, if you find Bb, you\u2019ll get C. If you have F#, you\u2019ll get G#. So far, so good. The problem is to do it at first sight. In order to do it, you can begin by learning how to read in the clef of C in third line. The third line in G clef is B, but in C clef is C, one degree above. So you just place an imaginary C clef on any passage originally written in G clef and you use the D major key signature. Now, for the chords you mention in your comment: F major becomes G major. G Major becomes A major, because of the C# in the key signature A Minor - becomes B minor, right, with F#, otherwise you would have Bdim. E Minor - F Major or Minor? Answer: None of them. E minor becomes F# minor, because you have F# and C#. Hope this helps. Edit : Thanks to Bill Hall for the correction. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a couple ways to think about it depending on your knowledge of theory. THE FIRST WAY\u2026 An easy way to think about it would be to simply move each chord in your chart UP by two half steps or one whole step. For example: Cmajor7 F D7 G7 am7 em7 F G C would become\u2026 Dmajor7 G E7 A7 bm7 f#m7 G A D You could take any chord chart and write the transposed chords right above them. THE SECOND WAY\u2026 If you\u2019re in Cmajor then the C chord is the first degree of that key signature and is referred to as the 1 chord. If you continue up the scale, you can identify each chord as a number. For example Cmaj = 1, dm = 2- (the dash connotes minor), em=3-, Fmaj = 4, G = 5, am = 6- and b dim. = 7 dim. If you know the numbers that identify each chord then you can write the numbers above the chords on a chord chart. Then, if you know the correlating chords in another key, you can play the chart in any other key. This skill creates a lot of flexibility and also freedom of thinking about music so I\u2019d encourage anyone interested to pursue it. It\u2019s not difficult to develop. One exercise would be to take a chord chart, write the numbers above it, copy and print that out to several other pages and then spend 5 or 10 minutes a day transposing the chart to different keys. Another exercise would be to try to listen to a song that you weren\u2019t familiar with and try to identify the chord changes by saying the numbers instead of thinking in chord letters. ",

            "answer_text": "On paper, using notation, it is easy: write everything out one place higher on the stave and put in the new key signature - 2 sharps (f & c). That is why it is called the KEY signature. Of course any chromatic notes outside of the key in the original should also be transferred with the accidentals mostly staying the same. However, sometimes care is needed - eg. Eb in C major become F natural in D major Another method is to move everything up two half steps - but this kind of defeats the point of having KEY signatures. Some musicians, as has already been observed, prefer to imagine a movable C Clef as orientation. Myself, I like to think or feel where I am in the scale of the KEY at any point (on the tonic, supersonic, medians etc.) and know my KEYS well enough to be able to move to any other KEY. ",

A B becomes a C#, a D becomes an E, and so on. So if you\u2019re transposing chords, you just need to transpose each not up one tone in this case. Chords will never be changed from Major to Minor, or vice-versa, since moving every note up the same distance will always produce the same type of chord. So, for your examples: F Major - G Major G Major - A Major A Minor - B Minor E Minor - F# Minor Notice the last example. E and F are only a half-tone apart; F# is the note 1 tone up from E, so that\u2019s the transposition. ",

So C becomes D, E becomes F#, major chords stay major, and minor chords stay minor. This method preserves musical qualities aside from pitch and is appropriate when you'd like to adapt a piece to someone's vocal range or make it easier to play on a certain instrument. There are other ways of changing keys that can also be called transposition and require a bit of music theory or experimentation to get right (as they involve making artistic choices), but based on your question I'm assuming chromatic transposition is what you're after.
