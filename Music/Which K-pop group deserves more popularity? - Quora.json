            "answer_text": "This question screams Berry Good.  They are a 5-member group that debuted in 2014 with the single \u2018Love Letter\u2019. A year after their debut, 3 members left to focus on their studies. As members departed and members were added, it caused the lineup to change a lot over time. In 2016, Berry Good held a fundraiser to help pay for the production of their first EP and thus \u2018Angel\u2019 was born.  You may have seen me share this a while back and it\u2019s still as big a masterpiece as it was then. They each have such strong vocals, Gowoon definitely shone in this song. Speaking of which, allow me to introduce the members: - Johyun  First things first, body goals. Johyun is the main rapper, lead dancer and of course, the visual. After living in the States for a couple of years, she became fluent in English. You may also recognize her from MIXNINE, she ranked 24th. Super wholesome human being too. - Seoyul  As you can see, Seoyul is equally gorgeous. She is the main dancer and lead vocalist of Berry Good. You may know her sister, she\u2019s Yuna from AOA! From what I\u2019ve seen, Seoyul is definitely the most friendly and outgoing. - Daye  (It\u2019s her birthday today!) Daye is absolutely lovely. She is the lead vocalist and rapper of the group. She\u2019s one of those idols who have very natural aegyo but are absolute queens on stage. Though she could be considered the \u201cmost problematic of the group\u201d, her personality is amazing and you can definitely tell she\u2019s grown since then. - Sehyung  Sehyung is the lead rapper, vocalist and the FOTG. She is also an actress! She was cast in a web drama with fellow idols Binnie (OMG) and Kriesha Chu last November. Her visuals are adorable and highkey reminds me of Xiumin from EXO. - Gowoon  She is the main vocalist and the youngest of the group. She\u2019s like me, she lights up the mood in an instant. She speaks English as well as Korean and she is actually the only member left from the original lineup. She is so freaking talented, her voice is\u2026 omg. She\u2019s the one who sings the high notes in \u2018Angel\u2019.  They don\u2019t have a set concept because they\u2019ve changed so much but that goes to show Berry Good can pull off any concept they want. Other than \u2018Angel\u2019 which is definitely a must-listen, some other good songs of theirs are \u2018Don\u2019t believe\u2019, \u2018Mellow Mellow\u2019 and my personal favorite, \u2018Oh! Oh!\u2019:  These girls are mucho talented and mucho not talked about enough. Please support them and listen to some of their stuff, they\u2019re more than amazing. ~flav.r ",

            "answer_text": "FOR ME these are 7 kpop groups that deserve more popularity: 1.Dreamcatcher  Their concept is unique (they actually are a rock group) and their videos fantastic. Siyeon (the Main Vocalist) is such a good vocalist, SuA is one of tge greatest main dancers, Dami has a good rap and in general every member is wow.I am still thinking why they aren\u2019t successful. 2.Loona  Loona is already popular, specially in America, but I think their popularity is not so much. They have an amazing concept (watch \u201cButterfly\u201d video), they are the funniest idols and are something magic that deserves a better recognition. 3.Gwsn  Damn they are so underrated. \u201cRed Sun\u201d is a BOP, but all their songs are bops. An incredible group. \ud83d\udc9d 4.Cherry Bullet  It\u2019s just a rookie group, but it looks like a senior group, that has already lost 3 members. I wish they will become more famous in the future (if there will be a happy future for the world). 5.Clc  One question:Why? Why is CLC underrated? They have everything and their last comebacks are beautiful. 6.Stray Kids  Finally a boy group. I know Stray Kids is already famous internationally but Korea sleeps on them and their last comebacks. They worked and work so hard really! 7.The Boys  Stan these guys! \ud83d\udc4d Ps.I know every group is talented and deserve the success it has or that it need to have, these are only my favourite 7 from the big underrated category.

            "answer_text": "iKON : They really deserve better. B.I.\u2019s departure was truly heart breaking and honestly he was the backbone of the group, the group is not the same without him but they are an amazing group even without him and I wish to see them prosper and succeed in the future! Also hope the same for B.I. Monsta X : Another criminally underrated group mannnn. PLEASE STOP SLEEPING ON MONSTA X\u2019S TALENT Y'ALL. They have some really catchy and beautiful songs like Beautiful, Hero, Follow, Who Do you Love, Shoot Out and so many more. Also their English discography is as good as popular western songs if not better. They're an all rounded group! GOT7 : They recieved their first daesang after 6 years although in my opinion, they should have gotten it way before and they're really worthy of more recognition and the mistreatment they get from JYPE is honestly heart breaking because at the end of the day, Got7 is not only some of the best people on earth but also one of the best groups in kpop talent wise. Stop sleeping on got7. The Boyz : I am not a big fan of them as for now but they have some really really good songs like Giddy Up, No Air (my personal favorite) and their visuals oml\u2026they remind of a rookie version of EXO because they're also 12 like EXO was once (sadly Hwall left in 2019 though). That's all for now, I will expand the list if I remember some other well deserving groups. :) Please give these groups a chance, listen to their songs if you haven't already, you won't regret it! :) ",

Golden child Okay okay they are getting quite popular these days but I stan them a long time and I always wondered why people keep sleeping on such talent! They are the most talented group I've seen and you can check it for yourself but they can do anything. 3. Pentagon Even tho I don't really stan yet, WHY DO YALL KEEP SLEEPING ON THEM. I was so shook when I found out they didn't had a first win yet while shine was one of the most ICONIC songs ever. I even heard it playing in a shop in my country. Like??? And the fact that they still don't have a win breaks my heart. And the worst thing is that a lot of people know them but are saying things like \u201cthey don't seem very interesting\u201d 4. Dreamcather Okay listen, these girls are amazing periodt. I love their songs so fkng much so they need more appreciation. I might edit this later when I think of more groups. Soo DON'T SLEEP ON TALENT tyyy ",

Please check out their debut song, \u201cSwear\u201d. It has a mysterious vibe to it, and it doesn\u2019t sound like your regular K-Pop song. ONEUSONEUS is a group full of talented idols, but they barley receive any recognition. I stumbled upon one of their songs and I\u2019m so glad I did. I fell in love first listen, and I\u2019m sure you will too. Please give them a chance! DAY6You\u2019ve probably heard of this group before, but have you ever listen to their songs? Because they are more of a rock band than an idol group, they aren\u2019t as well known. Instead of dancing, they play instruments! The members are hilarious and relatable. Sorry for not writing much! I can\u2019t really think of any at the moment. If I do, I\u2019ll add them! I was going to put Stray Kids, but they\u2019re actually pretty well known after they released their comeback. Have a good day/night ^^ ",
