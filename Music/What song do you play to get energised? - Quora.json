            "answer_text": "\u201cWhite Hot Day\u201d by Simple Minds. The song sounds almost like a movie soundtrack with its wash of keyboards cascading along a deceptively simple rhythm track and some typically intelligent and inspired guitar playing - filling the spaces at the right time, using the right tones and effects.

            "answer_text": "Spoonman by Soundgarden when I used to play bass this song got me going so well. my bass mentor played it and loved playing it so I learned it to impress him. I practiced and practiced and practiced it some more until I felt I played it well enough to let him hear it. then I recorded myself and sent the recording to him. he sent me back a message that said, \u201csounds great, spoongirl!\u201d from then on, that song was the one that energised me to the maximum!
