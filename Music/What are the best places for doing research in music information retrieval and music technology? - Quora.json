            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t say I\u2019m an expert on these topics. But by virtue of running an online music recording studio, I do come into contact with music professionals who have studied or acquired knowledge on them. To begin with, if you are planning to research it at school, I have been told that Berklee College of Music is an excellent choice. I know musicians who also recommend New York University and USC Thornton School of Music, as well as Standord. Online, you can also find courses on the subjects using sites such as Coursera. Apart from scholastic studies, there are also conferences and festivals you can attend to gain more knowledge. One of these is Music Tech Fest, which has been held in various cities around the world over the past few years, including Berlin, London and Paris. The International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) also puts on an annual conference and provides information on the topic. You can even sign up to become a part of their community at www.ismir.net. Upon checking their website, I found out that the next conference will be held from October 23 to 28 in Suzhou, China. I hope this helps and good luck. ",
