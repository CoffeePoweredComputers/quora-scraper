            "answer_text": "I love music. I think there was good music in the 60s and bad music in the 60s, and each decade thereafter, including this decade. Music is highly personal, so what you like and what I like are very likely not the same. There is much more music available today than ever, because anyone can put a song out on Soundcloud or YouTube and become an \u201cartist.\u201d And some people will like it, and some people will hate it. That\u2019s how music\u2019s always been. In the 50s, the older generation hated Elvis and the young generation idolized him. Beatles had the same divide in the 60s (oh that long hair). Rock bands in the 70s and 80s. There has always been an older generation saying that today\u2019s music is terrible and their music was the best. There is great music today, and it depends on what you want to hear. There are artists with meaningful music, there are artists with fun dance music, there are artists with great voices, and there are still great musicians. Is it better or worse than the 60s? Depends on who you ask. If you are looking at actual musicianship, there are fewer instruments being played by artists today. A lot of beats are digitally produced and a lot of the sound you hear is not coming from a traditional instrument. There are a tons more way to modify your sound today than there were in the 60s. Someone with a unique voice who has trouble with pitch can use auto tune to correct the pitch. Some people call all of that fake and say it\u2019s not music, but it is music. It has melodies and beats and lyrics, and it\u2019s music. It may not be what you\u2019re used to, but that doesn\u2019t make it bad. But there are also some great musicians out there tearing up traditional guitars, drums, pianos, brass, etc. so traditionally-played music is certainly not dead. There are rap songs that give me chills and make me cry. Same with hip hop. Pop is usually just more fun, to me. I like country (new and old) when I\u2019m in a certain mood. I love to play rock and roll in my car up loud, but the next song on my play list might be a Christian song. I love artists from Bruce Springsteen to Toby Mac to Carrie Underwood to Machine Gun Kelly to Motley Crue. I love Imagine Dragons, Thomas Rhett, Kid Ink, The Eagles, Elton John, Linkin Park, 30 Seconds to Mars, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Jason DeRulo, Adele, Queen, Rascal Flatts, Wiz Khalifa . . . I could go on and on. There is so much music to love, from then and now. I don\u2019t typically listen to much music from the 60s, but I appreciate it and the foundation it and all music after it laid for today\u2019s music. Bottom line, if something sounds good to you, then it\u2019s good music - to you. If you don\u2019t like it, that just means it\u2019s not good music - to you. The guy standing next to you may have the exact opposite opinion and that\u2019s ok. We all like what we like and what sounds like the best song ever to me, could sound like the worst song ever to you. So, now, to my opinion. 60s music was relatively simple and I prefer the more complex lyrics and melodies of today\u2019s music. But I listen to music from every decade and will always. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question! As a young teenager in the mid 60s and a music fan from my preteens, I will attempt to weigh in. Music took a sharp change in the early 50s with bill Haley and the Comets rock around the clock (before I was born). Then came Elvis and Little Richard and Ray Charles and Buddy Holly and and and\u2026 That brings us to the 60s. Everything changed with the Beatles and Bob Dylan. They began an era of songwriter performers. Everything after 63/64 was exciting and new. Writer musicians truly began understanding music theory. Some were talented, some were smart and some were just plain lucky. But every day brought something new. Were they better than today\u2019s musicians? Technically today\u2019s musicians are probably more skilled and educated. But today\u2019s music does not generate the newness of the 60s. Back then every day brought something totally new. With few exceptions I am not hearing anything totally new today. Its all kind of computerized and not really original. the good news is it\u2019s not too late to research 60s 70s and 80s music and beyond. I know, as a kid I craved music from the 40s and 50s. I am still learning that history and it\u2019s really rewarding. I am amazed at how many 20, 30 and even 40 somethings have no interest in our musical history. Go for it! ",
