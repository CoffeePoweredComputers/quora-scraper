Written by Lennon and assisted by McCartney4. Written by McCartney and assisted by Lennon 5. Written by Lennon and McCartney (equal share) 6. Written by Harrison 7. Others (Starr, McCartney-Harrison, Lennon-Harrison and covers) Category 1 - Lennon wrote 66 songs on his own. The most prominent ones were - Strawberry Fields Forever, Across The Universe, Lucy In The Sky etc. My personal favourite is Nowhere Man (and Yer Blues too) Category 2 - McCartney replied with 60 songs of his own. The most prominent ones are All My Loving, Hey Jude, Let It Be, Yesterday etc. My personal favourite is Penny Lane Category 3 - 11 songs come under this category. The most famous ones are Day Tripper and In My Life. The latter is my favourite of this type Category 4 - 11 songs come under this category as well. The most famous ones are Yellow Sub (sung by Starr), I Saw Her Standing There, Michelle, Elanor Rigby. My personal favourite is Drive My Car (mainly because Harrison (!) plays bass) Category 5 - 10 songs come under this category. Prominent ones are A Day In The Life , I Wanna Hold Your Hand. My personal favourite is the one that they wrote for Starr - With A Little Help From My Friends Category 6 - 27 songs were written by Harrison alone. The best ones are I Me Mine, Within You Without You, Something (mainly philosophical songs). I love the song While My Guitar Gently Weeps , which I feel is the signature of Harrison Category 7 - 43 songs come under the others category . Starr wrote 3 songs - Dont Pass Me By, Octopus' Garden, Trip To Carolina . Covers include Long Tall Sally, Twist And Shout (yes it is a cover!!) , Please Mr Postman, Roll Over Beethoven etc. My favourite is Rock And Roll Music (cover of Chuck Berry's work) ",
