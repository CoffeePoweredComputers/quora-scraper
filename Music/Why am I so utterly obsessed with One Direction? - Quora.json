Because they're nice. Because they're bad. Because they're handsome. Because they're male. Because they're legends. Because they're unique. Because a lot of people like them. Because they're something you really really like---including the songs, the tune, the lyrics, their faces--everything. Or maybe because you are encountering that teen phase on where you're super obssessed with 1D. I don't want to sound rude but honestly, I don't know.
