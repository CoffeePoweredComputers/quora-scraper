            "answer_text": "Producer, arranger, composer, audio engineer, tthis are specific skills. Depending where you are living, and how much you could invest. I believe that something like \u201c how to help musicians achieve their full potential in a recording environment \u201c defines the role the you are referring? A good preparation like the what this great people here offer Music Production and Engineering \u2026. would be a great start. To work as an assistant of someone that already has the good practice standards (and something more, sure\u2026) is gold. If you need some distance to think it better, try to think in what someone in the kitchen needs to prepare great food\u2026Can you do this and extrapolate it to \u201c Producer \u201c ? OK, hoping you answer and tried to picture it, now imagine to do this in different places like a big 5 star hotel as a \u201cchief\u201d with 30 40 60 ;-) helpers, or in small fantastic good feeling neighborhood vegan restaurant\u2026 I hope it helps. Have fun. ",
