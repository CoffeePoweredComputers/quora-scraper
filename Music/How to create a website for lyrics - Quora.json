            "answer_text": "So you can create a lyrics website with blogger by simply starting a blog and create a blog then name of your website.then simply adding theme to blog as you like and then post a new song lyrics after releasing any song. But my suggestion for you that if you want ti start a new website then you choose other than lyrics website because many authors start this type of website and there is a greater competition in this site if you want to work passionately then this hard work put in other websites by keywords researching tool which gives greatest result and also you earn big amount of money. As your wish. ",
