            "answer_text": "The song was written by Johnny Cash to his wife.  It was an assurance to her that, even though he was away from her a lot, performing on the road, he would never cheat on her, and not only that, it was easy not to because he loved her so much.  He would walk the line. Despite the magnanimous intent of the song, it appears the reality was different.  Most notably, shortly before his death, he confessed to the makers of his biopic (ironically called Walk the Line) that he and June Carter (who he widely performed with, and later married) had carried on an affair while he was still married to his first wife.  His first wife divorced him in 1966, and he married June two years later. ",
