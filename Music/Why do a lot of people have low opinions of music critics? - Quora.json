            "answer_text": "Because most music critics are simply providing their own view on the piece in question. Music critics know what they are talking about. If they pan something, such as \"This song sucks because X\", or \"This album is poorly mixed or produced\", or something similar, people tend to think of these observations as subjective, as most people who are reading the reviews don't have the time, means or money to investigate into the subject further. This is unfair on the critic, as he or she is actually one of the better sources for whether an album is actually good or bad. It gets worse when fans of the artist/band become involved, as I'll explain in detail below: Let me use an example that I've just made up: Lets say that this artist, Frank, has released an album called Nuclear war. Now Frank is a very popular artist, and has released three albums in the past. Two were okay, nothing special, but the third was either very well received, or very popular at least. However, Nuclear War sucks. As in its In Flames releasing Siren Charms all over again. And a music critic, let's call her Ashley, gives it a bad review, saying that it is nowhere near as good as his previous works, it is poorly received, and it rips off other artists/bands. Now, Frank has a large fan base, people who are familiar with his work. While a few take a look at the review before making a judgement call, most of his fans, who love Frank like a god, cry bullshit at Ashley. This is often due to the fact that fans, by dint of being his fans, are biased towards Frank and his music, and seek to vindicate his creative decisions. Now, the people who follow Frank on account of his music writing is excellent are also biased against Ashley, as they know what Frank can do, and hope that what he produces next lives up to the standards that they've constructed for themselves. They blindside themselves, and unless the album is so bad that it isn't funny, they are more than likely going to defend Frank's music. Music Critics have to listen and understand a vast amount of content. While a new pop album may be catchy, or popular, or whatever, a trained, experienced music critic who knows what he or she talks about will see through the catchy turns, and see that the song is simple, musically poor technically, or lacks passion or skill or whatever. This presents a dilemma for the fans of the album: That the album that they love is being attacked by some random who touts off fancy words, or does this person know something we don't? Generally, the response to the above is negative to the critic, as people rarely understand about music composition and techniques; all they hear is what gets pumped into them. Some people make the effort to explore further, and they find it easier to sympathise with the Critic's position, but, to quote Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black, \"A Person is Smart; People are dumb, panicky, and you know it.\" Which brings us to the heart of the matter: As social creatures, humans do not like being the odd one out. Using a variant of the Bystander effect, People who collectively love something that is generally considered by someone who knows what they're talking about as crap will not often take a minute to consider the thoughts of the critic, and, in a effort to conform with the group, will attack the critic.  Even for critics, there is immense pressure to conform with the popular opinion, which is why a lot of reviews of very popular albums that I have seen recently have been mostly splurging and gushing about how good the artist or whatever is without actually touching on the quality of the album, which is clearly of a low standard. This is what upsets me about mainstream music these days, is that people are producing poor quality music that is inherently popular with society as a whole, but critics, whose job is to analyse and dissect an album as to whether it is good or not, are following with the popular opinion, blindsiding people to the truth of the matter.Hope this helps! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Because music has to be listened to and not read about. It is usually what rock and metal musicians do. They talk about music, like really talk too much about music. Go to any review site like Pitchhfork for example. Choose any album. Read all those nonsensical long sentences and all that pretentiousness. They are so smug it is almost painful to read them. Now If you know people who really love music and don\u2019t need any kind of validation from others, they simply listen to music. They don\u2019t go around trying to impress everyone with their musical taste. It is ok to read about new albums as a guide or a \u201cshopping list\u201d but we all know music critics are not about that. It is about their \u201csuperior taste\u201d and the need to tell others what is \u201cgood\u201d. Also, some people get offended when critics trash their favourite artists. ",
