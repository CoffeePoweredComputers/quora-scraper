On her season of \u2018We Got Married\u2019, she was paired with Eric Nam, an English speaker. He took that to his advantage and taught Solar some English words and phrases. Judging from that and other instances where she\u2019s spoken the language, she has really good pronunciation. But other than that, none of the members are great at English. ~flavor ",
