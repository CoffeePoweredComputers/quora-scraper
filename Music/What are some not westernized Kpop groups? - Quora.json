            "answer_text": "Pretty much every k-pop group has some degree of westernization. However, I would say the relatively cute/innocent/nice groups are generally the least western, particularly the ones that use mostly Korean producers. Really, just look at the groups that smash on the Korean digital charts but don\u2019t do much on Youtube. This would include groups like Block B, Highlight, Seventeen, GFriend, Mamamoo, and APink. I\u2019ve also found westerners have a hard time with large (>7) member groups like EXO and Twice. ",
