            "answer_text": "Thanks A2A Well my finals are going and this song came out at 9:30 exactly half hour before my math exam and I listened to it the first time and throughout my exam this bop song kept playing in my head. It is definitely the song of the summer and it has got that a little touch of Justin Timberlake and a little bit of old school pop which makes me kinda of jump everytime i listen to it. You can get that my granny is jamming to this song in the car even when she doesn't understand a single word in English. It is like a pop / dance song with a guy in love with a girl he can have. That's just my interpretation of the song. The last high note kind of startled me and startles me every damn time. I have been jamming it throughout the day. I really the pre chrous part in the song. Coming to the music video, I don't think that I even have to say how great it is. I mean the way his arm is flexed back and he slowly sits up on a couch in an abandoned Warehouse and with a background of Toronto in the back and then he goes to that gorgeous piano and then those bts scenes and the choir with the treadmill finish is just my vibe for this summer. Hope you like my review of this song. If so upvote it, comment it. Until then, treat people with kindness ",

            "answer_text": "His voice sounds amazing and powerful and like pushing the instruments. He\u2019s trying to get a lot of elements in his voice and specially the Falsetto is beautiful.His voice is definitely sounding on pitch while he sings the low notes.He\u2019s not pushing his voice like he did in stitches, he keeps his voice light.His voice carries the entire chorus.And the last falsetto high note is like a scream but bright and perfectly fits with the song and just like the cherry on top of the cake. Talking about the lyrics, they are definitely interesting. ",
