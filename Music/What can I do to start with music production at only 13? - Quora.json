            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s what you DON\u2019T need to get into music production: Expensive equipmentComplicated softwareTalentYears of experienceTo start, make use of what you already have (which I assume is a smart phone or tablet). Download GarageBand if you have an iOS device and start there. You can actually do a lot with this simple app, more than what most people suggest. From there, you have two options: learn on your own or get help from an experienced instructor. I currently mentor young students on how to produce in GarageBand and I do so because I believe it\u2019s the easiest, most intuitive, most fun way to get started in production. You can teach yourself, sure, but that takes months, sometimes years and the likelihood of failure is extremely high. If you\u2019d like to be instantly boosted to an advanced level of producing relatively quickly and affordably, I\u2019d consider my online course / mentor-ship. It provides a ton of value to people in your position. I\u2019d love to help you! Regardless, GarageBand is my best recommendation on how to get started. My little brother can use it and he\u2019s 12. ",

            "answer_text": "As those below have said, pretty much everything is open to you, but my guess is you have very little money, and feel like you don\u2019t have much time, and want to know where to start. A few things that you can definitely do: If you have a computer, even a smartphone, you can get a DAW. There are plenty of free or near-free ones. They all have their quirks, but they can all be used to make music in some way.Work out the basics of the style of music you want to make. Let\u2019s say you like modern EDM/Techno/Dubstep - try to make different kick drum and bass sounds. Like hip hop? Get some old drum breaks and work out how to use a sampler. Listen to the tunes you like and try to replicate their sounds.Listen to music you don\u2019t like. Go out of your way to listen to music you don\u2019t enjoy - whether it\u2019s too sweet and simple, or weird and noisy and complex. Try to break the different parts up in your head, and work out why they\u2019ve been put together that way. What parts of the sound come from which types of production? Now try to do the same with music you actually like.",
