            "answer_text": "Adele's songs are quite autobiographical, focusing on specific periods of time in her life. For example, her debut record, 19, chronicles her entrance into adulthood. And her sophomore record, 21, describes the end of a romantic relationship and her recovery from it. In the liner notes for 21, writing credits on all songs (except for her cover of The Cure's Lovesong) include Adele, plus various producers and musical collaborators. ",
