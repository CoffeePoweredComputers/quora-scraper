Then you will be 21 or so, you might get the chance to debut or not, based on your talent. Most of the contracts end at the age of 30 or so. Then you wouldn\u2019t have much time being a kpop idol. But you could try auditioning, probably the big three won\u2019t be a good option for you to audition for because they have more training time then the other agencies so the little companies will do the trick but still not sure about the little companies too.
