            "answer_text": "Because they involve an element of risk. Will I\u2019ll be able to handle what I am seeing - or will it frighten me too much? It\u2019s like standing close to the edge of a cliff, and looking over, to see how much it affects you. Also, when a horror movie has a good story, and we relate to the characters, then we care about what happens to them \u2014 even if it is the monster! The group experience of watching horror is also what makes it fun. Every enjoyable experience you\u2019ve had with a horror film, is usually with a friend, or a group of friends, when you can laugh and joke and yell at the screen - and see who jumps the most at the crucial scenes; then talk about it afterwards. You mostly watch horror films as a teenager - and that\u2019s the time in your life when you are actively chasing \u2018thrills\u2019. People that don\u2019t find horror films fun, or exciting, will avoid them. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s like a roller coaster or other fair ride (only safer!) We like thrills and adventure. And unlike a ride at the fair, if it gets too intense we can walk out or turn off the DVD player. It\u2019s a safe \u201cride\u201d usually. It also allows us to let off steam and scream in a socially appropriate/approved way. ",
