            "answer_text": "No, no, no, no, no! You\u2019re talking about two entirely different things that have no relation to each other whatsoever. This should be clear to you from the foregoing excellent explanations, but I will reiterate what they have said to make the point a little clearer to those who, as you did, have mistakenly conflated two fingering techniques that look a little bit alike because the left hand seems to be moving the same shape up and down the neck. So, yeah, playing power chords and employing barr\u00e9 may look similar, but they are not the same thing at all. Here is what is different. Barr\u00e9 (pronounced \u201cbah-RRAY\u201d by the French who coined the term, but just \u201cBAR\u201d by Americans) is the practice of applying the full length of the index finger across all six strings as a temporary capo to uniformly raise the pitch of all tones in any chord that one can finger with the three remaining fingers of the left hand.It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of chord that is. The whole point of the technique is to play the same style of chord at a higher pitch. The effect is that the chord sounds identical harmonically, but higher pitched.Guitar players like to do this because it\u2019s easy to just slide a finger shape up the neck and play a different chord. To cite the most common example, if you play an E major chord as 022100 employing the second, third and fourth fingers, you can slide that shape up the neck and play different major triads by applying barr\u00e9 at the fret below the fret on the G string that your second finger is holding down.Again, it doesn\u2019t have to be a major triad like E. Some of the other chord shapes I use with barr\u00e9 to play chords with different root tones are these: E7, E7sus4, Esus4, E7add6, E9, Em, Em7, Em9, Em6, A, A7, Amaj7, Asus2, Asus4, A7sus4, Am, Am7 and Dm6. There are others shapes I use that I can\u2019t think of at the moment that use full barr\u00e9.There are also many more moveable shapes that don\u2019t use barr\u00e9 at all, or employ demi-barr\u00e9, where a finger holds down two or more strings at the same time at the same fret position. My favorite demi-barr\u00e9 shape is Dmaj7 as X00222, played with the third finger. When slid up the neck, one applies a another demi-barr\u00e9 two frets lower on the A and D strings with the first finger. This leaves the second finger unused, and the only way you can keep it out of the way is to hold it straight out, which may give people the impression that you\u2019re flipping them off. But, I digress.Take note that none, not one of the chords cited above is a power chord. Got that? They are not the same thing at all.Power chords are stripped-down, hollowed out chords containing nothing more than a root tone and the perfect fifth interval above that root tone, e.g., A and E, B\u266d and F, C and G, D and A, E and B, F and C, G and D and so on.This is technically known as a dyad, but not all dyads (two-tone proto-chords) are power chords. This term is generally reserved for dyads at the fifth interval, but power chords occasionally employed, sparingly, with a diminished or augmented fifth interval. Other intervals are not usually classified as \u201cpower chords\u201d. Read on to find out why.Power chords are employed on heavily amplified electric stringed instruments, principally six-string guitars with steel strings. The term is reserved for chords played on the E (sixth), A (fifth) and sometimes D (fourth) strings. If all three lower-pitched strings are used, then the D string should be held down two frets above the position where the E string is held down to sound the tone an octave above the E string.The reason why power chords consist of just two tones, and are generally restricted to the fifth interval between those two tones, is that early adopters of electrical amplification found that as one added different tones to a chord, the sound emitted at high levels of amplification became increasingly muddy. To avoid such distortion, they experimented with playing fewer strings, starting with the higher pitched strings, until they got down to just two. With just two strings vibrating, the amplified sound was the least distorted polyphonic sound. So, power chords were born. When two sounds of different pitches are played together, and they are not octave intervals, the least distortion is engendered by the perfect fifth interval. Finding this to be the case has encouraged electric guitar players to employ power chords to good effect.One can play power chords on fretless stringed instruments like violins and cellos by simultaneously bowing across two strings held down at the same position or left open because these instruments are tuned in 5ths rather than 4ths like guitars. Before amplification, this was the only way to deliver the distinctive sound of a power chord.What distinguishes power chords from major and minor triads is the absence of the third interval, which is the distinguishing characteristic between major and minor triads. For example, an E power chord, which is commonly referred to as E5, isn\u2019t major or minor; it contains the two tones, E and B, common to both the E major and E minor chords. What\u2019s missing is the major triad\u2019s G\u266f tone or the minor triad\u2019s G tone.Lacking a third interval, power chords can be employed with any major or minor scale, using six of the seven tones in the scale as the root tone, and still have both tones of the dyad be consistent with that scale. Only the 7th interval of a major scale, which is the same as the 2nd interval of its relative minor scale, doesn\u2019t work. The reason is that the 5th above the 7th interval is dreaded tritone, 6 half-steps above the tonic, half way to the octave above the root tonic.As power chords are played on the three bass strings, there is no need to employ barr\u00e9, so no one does. The only connection between barr\u00e9 and power chords is the practice of sliding a single fingering shape up and down the neck to play different chords.",

            "answer_text": " Similar. The power chord is made up of only two notes of the scale the chord is derived from. The 1 & 5. For instance, if you were playing a G power chord it would be made up of the G & D notes. And are commonly thought of as minor chords because they don\u2019t have the 3rd note in them. As the Barre chord is made up of all three notes in the major triad of the scale. G major barre chord would have the 1 3 & 5th note in it.  The power chord can really be thought of like an abbreviated barre chord because it is formed very similarly to the barre chord. The difference is, It uses fewer notes and only two fingers are required. As the barre chord uses more notes and all the fingers are required to form it. In fact, in my opinion, learning to play power chords can be a nice prerequisite for playing barre chords. It helps you to learn to stretch out your fingers and move up and down the fretboard. Just like playing barre chords. What makes barre chords so difficult to play is holding down the barre with your index finger. You don\u2019t need to do this with the power chord. But the power chord gets your fingers in shape to eventually play a barre chord. Here is a lesson I teach on my website that will explain this further.
