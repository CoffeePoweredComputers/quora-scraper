            "answer_text": "Well most of the things that we do are indirectly somehow related to google whether we had reached that website using Google search engine, by clicking on the advertisement on some other websites, by watching videos we got to know something, product of google, and many more. The losses that would occur would be huge as it\u2019s one of the largest and biggest tech companies in the world. Let us take few statistics into accounts: Let\u2019s make the advertising revenues ~$ 80 billion. Doing the math for the single day revenue in single day comes to about ~$217 Million. That\u2019s a lot of money for us to imagine. After excluding the expenses and costs, the net figure comes out to ~$23 billion. 2. Google\u2019s parent company earning\u2019s in the year 2016 was $90.3 billion and revenue growth of 20% year over year. 3. You would be amazed to know that Google\u2019s advertising revenue was $79.383 billion which comes roughly around 87.8% of the total revenue posted in the financial year 2016 which ended in December. That\u2019s a staggering stat. * This doesn\u2019t include the costs and expenses incurred by the company. Imagine if it shutdown in 2016 for a day then it would have realized a loss of $217 million and not just the revenue loss but many things more. People all around the world would go gaga as to why it happened and why such a big company isn\u2019t doing or if it\u2019s doing then why didn\u2019t the operations started.There are 5.5 billion searches on Google everyday, and 1.2 trillion searches each each worldwide according to a research for the year 2016. This means google won\u2019t be able to process 5.5 billion searches a day.Source: Google now handles at least 2 trillion searches per year  This is the data for the year 2016 and for 2017 it would surely be more. 3. Most of the people depend on Google Maps for the location details and it would be bizarre to not have maps as 69% of the estimated user base of Maps use Google Maps. People probably may have to switch to another maps and apparently no Live traffic updates. Source: New survey says Google Maps favored by nearly 70 percent of iPhone users 4.Stock prices would crash and it may see a bigger downfall. 5. Gmail is the most widely used email service and according to report it crossed more than 1 billion in 2016.  Source: Gmail Now Has More Than 1B Monthly Active Users 6. Android users won\u2019t get the support required and won\u2019t be able to use Google Play Store that means a huge revenue loss to the application developers as they earn from downloads and for the company itself. These are some of the things and much more could happen. Hopefully this doesn\u2019t happen!! ",

            "answer_text": "A day is wayyy long. But let's assume that Google shuts down for 30 mins and see the consequences\u2026. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Flashback\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 In August 2013, Google and all of its services came down briefly for 2-3 mins. And the whole internet traffic went down by a massive 40%. A similar incident also occurred in May 2009.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Note that it was just for 2 mins. Imagine 30 mins. It\u2019s highly unlikely but here is what I think will happen \u2013 First few mins people will check their internet connection. Some will even call their Service Provider. Some may even check for hardware failures on their side \u2013 which is still more likely than 30 min outage.People will then realise that it\u2019s true. There will be a period of disbelief. People will desperately try to reload google\u2019s homepage.People all around the world will start taking screenshots of the Google Server Error Page. [Likely 500]Your Facebook Newsfeed will be full of \u201cOMG Can\u2019t believe\u201d, \u201cI witnessed something astonishing\u201d along with several images from previous point.People will search for alternate search engine \u2013 but how ? Most of them don\u2019t even know that there are alternate search enginesBing and Yahoo will get huge traffic surge.DuckDuckGo( Page on duckduckgo.com ) will start trending on Twitter. People will realise it\u2019s good. (That\u2019s a search engine that doesn\u2019t track you BTW)Many other internet apps \u2013 that uses Google Services in backend will also come down. Without GMAIL for 30 mins the productivity across the whole world will drop by a huge margin.I can\u2019t even imagine the Revenue Loss \u2013 not just for Google but for all the companies throughout the world that uses Google.Android users will be stranded on the roads and iPhone users will be lost in the lanes if Google Maps stopped working for 30minsAmong all this fiasco Internet life in China will remain unaffected.People at other competitive companies will enjoy and sing songs (Meant to be a joke)After the outage is fixed and services are restored: Google will release their statement to the press \u2013 explaining the cause (may be)Tech Savvy people around the world will try to dig deep in search for the cause of outage.Many will speculate that a group of Hackers are responsible. People will then approach many Hackers regarding their opinionMedia will go crazy. They will call experts and try to analyse situation themselves.Many bloggers will write post about \u201cHow we are too dependent on Google? \u2013 A reality check\u201d. Even Media will do itQuora would be full of questions \u2013 \u201cWhy did it happen ?\u201d, \u201cWhat do you think about the outage ?\u201d, \u201cCan it happen again ?\u201d, \u201cWas my data leaked?\u201d, \u201cIs it true that Google was hacked ?\u201d, etc.A lot of users will switch from Google services to alternates.BuzzFeed and ScoopWhoop will have articles like \u201cGoogle went down for 30 minutes. You won\u2019t believe what happened next.\u201d and \u201c10 things to do when Google goes down the next time\u201d.People will find this answer and realize that many of it is actually happening (Again, meant to be a joke)Time For Indian Version!  Let us first confront the reality that this is a possibility. I am assuming that such a ban will be enforced by the Supreme Court because the government simply cannot do it. I am also assuming that all Google services and Google owned products will be banned with an immediate effect without prior notice. So here is my take on the immediate reaction: Rahul Gandhi will try to blame Modi government for it but will end up trolling himself.Meanwhile some politicians will go on a hunger strike and ask the government to lift the ban.Indecent words will be spoken in Lok Sabha accompanied by loud thumping of tables.Sundar Pichai will receive an enormous amount of media attention. He will probably make a statement. People will ask him to resign.https://duckduckgo.com/ and Bing will receive huge traffic from India and they will be very happy about it.Life of most Indians will be disrupted and almost everyone will suffer.Needless to say Twitter and Facebook will be full of posts about this ban.Porn traffic will decline steeply.Uber, Ola and other services using Google Map service will all stop working. Regular taxi fares will suddenly jump.People won\u2019t know what to do with their computers anymore. Internet Service Providers will receive huge number of false complaints that the customer\u2019s internet is not working.Here is the aftermath : Google will suffer from huge financial loss. They will have to close their Indian offices.AIB will make a video titled \u201cIndia reacts to ban of Google\u201d and that will be funny. But wait where will they upload ? No YouTube. HotStar !Indian Media will go crazy and run reports about conspiracy behind the ban.At least 10 new startups will come up with Indian version of Google. Most CEOs will be ex-Googlers. There might be names like \u201cKhoj\u201d (Hindi for Search), \u201cTehkiqat\u201d (Hindi for Investigation), \u201chttp://gINgle.com\u201c, etc. There will be startups to replicate Google Docs, YouTube, Gmail, etc too.\u201cGoogle ban in India\u201d will become the most queried phrase on Google globally.The hype around Google hiring IITians will finally go away.International investors looking for investment in Indian tech scene will pull off.
