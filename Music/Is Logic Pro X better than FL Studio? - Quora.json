            "answer_text": "I'mma a music producer who has worked with EDWAN, acestoaces, B3NTE and many more\u2026. The main criteria of judging a DAW is work flow.(since most of the DAW's provide the same tools to work, efficiency comes in play here) For logic, you need an apple device whereas fl works on both windows and apple. FL studio is called the beginner's DAW because of its simplicity\u2026 My advice would be: Start with FL studio to get a hang of how a DAW works.And later on at a stage, you can switch to some advanced DAWs like Ableton, (logic X in your case)Cheers Happy producing ",

You just need a software to lay down your ideas. The software that helps you do it with the most ease, is the best software. Like for me, it is FL Studio. Cheers, The Xenial Secret ",
