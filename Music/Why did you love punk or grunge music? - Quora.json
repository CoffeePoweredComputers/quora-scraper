            "answer_text": "Not did. Do. For the same reason I love anything organic and spontaneous. The more production (admittedly, many things considered punk are overproduced in the studio and therefore do not qualify as punk) a passionate and intentionally disruptive track has the less effective it will inevitably be in a live experience. If it cannot be performed live even better than the studio version it is not a legitimately punk endeavor. This is why with popularity and wider circulation a punk band inevitably experiences abandonment by its original fan base (think green day) and may choose to grow beyond the more passionate and reckless and viscerally violent live shows and move toward pop(red hot chili peppers\u2014yes, they were originally considered punk) or soft rock to please the new wider fan base and the record co. The best punk bands refuse to go that way. They may dabble in pop for irony (think butthole surfers) or resist it and the allure of easy money in favor of alternate forms of wide exposure and better income like music festivals or soundtrack material for movies (flaming lips) or they might just be content to do small live shows and keep the punks happy and their own integrity intact (fugazi). The best punk is the raw unproduced uncompromised undiscovered local garage band that has been right under your nose. Go out and find them and show your support. You might even decide to stage dive. It can be very exhilarating. Just make sure there is a nice crush at the front so you dont hit the floor. ",

            "answer_text": "Being a nerd, I have to draw a distinction between punk and garage. Garage is born in the 1960s in America, with an infusion from 60s British bands (esp. the Yardbirds) added to a certain native raw energy. It was suburban young guys playing as loudly and snottily as they could. At its best, it's exhilarating and exciting and direct. It doesn't aim any higher than that. Punk is born in both the UK and USA in the 70s. It is created in part as a reaction to what was going on around it, so it has a critical aspect missing from garage. At its best (IMO, in British punk anyway, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, X-Ray Spex), it is more ambitious than garage because it wants to downgrade and reject the mainstream and champion a more direct form of communication. American punk (Germs, Black Flag, Minutemen, Husker Du) is more ambivalent about previous music and in my personal view sometimes better listening. Bad punk champions ineptitude for its own sake, and is only enjoyable if you were there at the time. Both garage and punk wanted to recapture the energy of early rock & roll, but for garage that energy was not yet spent, whereas by punk it had to be consciously recreated. What I love about them both can be summed up in the words of the UK music writer Ben Watson, in his comparison of punk with the early Beatles singles: \u2018It\u2019s completely brilliant yet you think you could have come up with it yourself.\u2019 It is both musically effective, and personally empowering. Even now that I\u2019m a guitar player of 30 years with some jazz schooling and a fascination with Bach\u2019s cello suites, I still find that to be the uniquely lovable common factor between punk and garage.
