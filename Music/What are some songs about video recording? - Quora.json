Not entirely about video recording, but it\u2019s mixed in there\u2026and it\u2019s on my workout mix for some strange reason. Second is \u201cKino\u201d, by Cabaret Voltaire. The third is \u201c30 Frames a Second\u201d, by Simple Minds. A very good song too\u2026 I\u2019m showing my (rapidly advancing) age\u2026 ",
