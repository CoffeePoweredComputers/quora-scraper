            "answer_text": "Brass instruments are NATURALLY tuned close to the harmonic series, because that\u2019s how they produce their notes. This means that the 7th partial (the \u201cAlphorn Seventh\u201d) is quite flat; unusable in fact, unless it is adjusted. Some other partials are quite far off as well. But most brass instruments are NOT tuned exactly this way, because of vagaries in the lead pipe, mouthpiece backbone, and differences in tubing flare that affect different notes differently. Even if I have to put my upper F farther out a quarter of an inch, by the time I\u2019m in fifth position I might not have to put it out that far, just because. For example, I play trombone and most trombones are quite sharp on the 6th partial (first position F over the bass staff), which is NOT according to the harmonic series. I own seven trombones presently (yeah, I know) and every one has different tuning on each of the partials. Some are quite close to each other, but I have to remember which one I am playing and what the adjustments are, and that\u2019s even before I start to tune according to the musical context. Also, if you are playing a valved instrument, any two valves in combination are going to be too sharp compared with only one valve. Three is even worse. There are tactics to deal with this, like trumpet thumb and ring finger valve slides, and tubists can pull valve slides as needed, and there may be alternate fingerings that are better in tune, but a lot of the time we are just lipping it. At least trombonists have a fighting chance to get the tubing the correct length. All brass instruments\u2014in fact, all wind instruments\u2014adjust tuning from note to note according to the context of the moment. This means that an E will not be tuned the same if it is the 3rd of a C major chord or if it is the 3rd of a C sharp minor chord, or the fifth of an A chord, etc. The only time we play close to equal temperament is when we are playing with a piano which is unable to adjust pitch, or for some atonal music where thirds and sixths that need the most adjustment are few and far in between. Most of the time, we are tuning according to the key, so that perfect intervals are exact simple ratios and major and minor intervals agree with the lowest versions of those intervals that show up in the harmonic series. This is not at all the way the instrument tunes naturally, though. We are fighting the instrument\u2019s natural tuning tendencies all the time. ",
