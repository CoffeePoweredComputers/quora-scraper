            "answer_text": "i always found this a strange comparison, i guess i find myself seeing things in a different light. so many people think frank sinatra is such a great singer-i don t. i think he s a good singer, but i don t think he is good as tony bennett. maybe i have a different way of viewing things when it comes to vocalists, and music in general. people talk about technique, and i hear a lot of people who have praised frank sinatra for his technique and timing. frank sinatra has excellent timing. i think he s somewhat boring as a singer, and thats what maybe it comes down to. i find him redundant, despite his good technique. i find tony bennett tends to put more emotion in his singing and has more variety in his emotion. i think this is important. despite people tend to think frank sinatra is so good. i find he sings every song with similar emotion. i find tony bennet sings with more variance,emotion and excitement. and frank sings with good technique and is singular in emotion. but i m a musician that put emotion,expression, above technique, and so called training. ie music is to be felt.] ",

            "answer_text": "OK\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve been waiting for this for years!. Both are superb singers and admired each other. It\u2019s how they interpret a tune that counts. I believe Sinatra was the better of the two at interpreting a tune, but Bennett is (was) a belter who can kick the crap out of a tune, but has a tendency to get a bit off-key. Sinatra would never allow himself to sing off-key as he was a perfectionist. Both singers draw crowds, but I personally enjoy Sinatra as I am a musician and Frank sings like a musician. ",
