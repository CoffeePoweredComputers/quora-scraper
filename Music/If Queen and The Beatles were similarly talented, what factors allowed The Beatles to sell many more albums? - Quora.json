            "answer_text": "\"If Queen and The Beatles were similarly talented, what factors allowed The Beatles to sell many more albums?\" The Beatles and Queen were not similarly talented.I would go so far as to say that probably 3 out of 4 members of Queen were \"better\" guitarists than The Beatles.3 out of 4 members of The Beatles were better singers than 3 out of 4 members of Queen.3 out of 4 members of Queen could read music (0 out of 4 for The Beatles).The Beatles happily included other players on their recordings. Queen put great effort into ensuring it was only themselves on their first several albums (I assume they weren't playing the orchestral instruments on the Flash soundtrack album though).The Beatles utilised the skills, knowledge and experience of George Martin to enhance their recordings. Queen fairly quickly got to doing mostly everything themselves.Queen demonstrated more virtuoso abilities than The Beatles.The Beatles had a lyrical genius. Queen lyrics don't connect with as many people as Beatles lyrics.The Beatles had a melodic genius. Well, okay, Queen melodies are right up there as well.Queen didn't have an acrimonious break up (i.e. they had better interpersonal skills when it came to dealing with conflict).The list of differences could probably go on forever so that'll be enough. The reason The Beatles sold so many more albums will be down to an incredible number of factors but the most obvious ones to me are:Queen don't really have many songs which are in keys the average Joe can sing along with - The Beatles had a reasonable number of songs which weren't in insanely high keys.Queen didn't have the same \"banter factor\" as The Beatles and Freddie even actively avoided interviews (effectively avoiding opportunities to promote their music).The Beatles were pretty much without precedent - you could argue Queen (and almost everyone else) were standing on the shoulders of The Beatles. As impressive as Queen were they quite possibly wouldn't have done half of what they did if they'd not been inspired by people like The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix in the first place. Genuinely new things often grab the attention of greater numbers of people.My personal observation in the '80s was that a lot of people thought we should all shun Queen because (in their words) it was \"just a bunch of four poofs\". Ignorant times.Queen's first couple of albums don't seem to have any connection to real life with songs such as \"Ogre Battle\", \"Fairy Feller's Master-stroke\" and \"My Fairy King\". If you're in a record shop and you see song titles like that you're going to think they sound like they'll be weird if you like mainstream music (that's where the sales are). Early Beatles songs had titles that sounded like they would obviously be good songs. Later ones sounded more stupid, such as \"Polythene Pam\" and \"Dig A Pony\", but by that point the fans were solidly committed.The Beatles songs sound fine even when played by relative beginners. Queen songs, not so much. It's also easier to work out how to play Beatles songs as they consist of \"normal\" chords in the main part (they're not all Bb, Eb and Ab chords either lol) and you can simply strum your way through most of their tunes.Brian May never learned to do the \"guitar face\". He's too honest with his playing. If he plays something slightly wrong he shows it in his face. People who don't play guitar rely on things like body language to assess whether the person is a good guitarist or not. The Beatles always made it look effortless and fun.There was an element of reverse snobbery. They all had degrees. That's not very rock 'n' roll at all. There were people who believed Queen had worked out a masterplan for taking over the world and were somehow \"faking it\".The Beatles were, on average, more physically attractive. Even John Lennon commented on how good looking Paul McCartney was (and still is, depending who you ask).Other bands did what they could to imitate The Beatles. Nobody tried to copy Queen. That made people wonder if Queen were somehow less valid/important muscially.By the time Queen came along there was an ever-increasing supply of alternative bands for people to get into instead so it was harder for one band to monopolise.Queen weren't particularly \"on trend\" and were not appreciated by fans of certain genres such as puck. The Beatles basically set the trends so they were on them by default.The media often spoke about Queen with negative and critical language and tone.Queen were never cool. Only popular. People didn't feel they would be a social leper if they didn't have the latest Queen album. That be my opinion anyway... ",

            "answer_text": "As others have mentioned, I do think that competition was a major factor. At the peak of the Beatles in the late \u201860s, there were only about 300 major-label albums put out per year \u2014 and that included R&B, rock, pop, and country. By the time Queen was at their peak a decade later, that number had more than quadrupled. So, in at least a general sense, Queen had four times the amount of competition. And then aside from other factors mentioned, I think it actually comes down to a simple difference: The Beatles were a pop band more so than Queen was. This seems wrong on the surface, and it\u2019s admittedly a very general statement, so let me explain. Queen didn\u2019t attempt to be popular, for the most part, and certainly not in their earliest years. Their popularity was almost despite their musical direction otherwise. Yes, like the Beatles, they created some songs very specifically for crowd appeal, which is a pop strategy. But many other (most?) Queen songs are very anti-pop. Their signature \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d violates many standards of 1975 pop music \u2014 and yet is one of the most popular songs of all time. Conversely, McCartney and Lennon joked about sitting down to \u201cwrite a swimming pool,\u201d meaning a song that would earn them a nice sum of money. And sure enough, they did that time and time again. They had undeniable pop sensibilities and intentions through at least most of their years. And they were often mindful of their standing in pop culture, including their friendly rivalry with the Stones and Beach Boys during the middle years. Plus, they certainly did nothing to eschew pop status when it came to selling merchandise and appearing in films. Even Lennon\u2019s infamous and outrageous \u201cbigger than Jesus\u201d quip only served to earn them more media coverage, leading Ringo to joke that they loved it when people burned their records because it meant they had to buy them first. The most notable anti-pop thing the Beatles did was stop touring in 1966 \u2014 and some people have even argued that only made them more popular (not unlike Steely Dan\u2019s lack of touring in the \u201870s).
