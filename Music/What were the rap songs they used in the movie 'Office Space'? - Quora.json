            "answer_text": "Great movie with a really good soundtrack. (1) Scarface - No Tears - Michael is stuck in traffic and raps along to this with the windows rolled up. This scene was the most memorable scene for me - my favorite from the movie. (2) Geto Boys - Damn It Feels Good To Be a Gangsta - Peter guts a fish at his desk (3) Slum Village - Get Dis Money (4) Ice Cube - Down For Whatever - the virus scene (5) Geto Boys - Still - a copy machine gets destroyed with baseball bats. Family guy did a sick parody of this with the same music. (6) Kool Keith - Get Off My Elevator - plays in the end credits (7) Canibus & Biz Markie - Shove This J-O-B - Also in the end credits ",
