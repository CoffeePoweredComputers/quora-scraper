            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t lived in LA myself (I have been there), but I have lived just outside of both Tampa (St Pete) and Miami (Hallandale Beach). Really, this boils down to what you\u2019re looking for. I would put Miami and LA in the same category. They are both exceptionally large cities with a ton of diversity and they each have that \u201clife of the rich and famous\u201d feel to them. Miami\u2019s beaches blow LA\u2019s out of the water. The water itself is more inviting. It\u2019s warmer, more tropical and clear, and the fishing is top notch. But, each of these cities comes at a cost (literally and figuratively). The prices in Miami and LA are pretty insane. If that isn\u2019t a concern (good for you) then you\u2019ll be right at home. The cities really are tailored to the affluent. You\u2019ll be around plenty of people in your socio-economic class and there are more activities than you\u2019ll be able to attend. Tampa is still a good-sized city, but it\u2019s no Miami or LA. There is still plenty to do, prices are reasonable, they have professional hockey, football, and baseball teams which typically bode well for a city. Honestly, if you\u2019re looking for a real up-and-coming area check across the bay to St. Pete. I grew up in the area and it\u2019s nothing short of remarkable where it\u2019s come from. It went from a city we were told to steer clear of as kids to without a doubt the most thriving area of Pinellas or Hillsborough counties. I\u2019ve actually been considering a move home myself recently. Prices are increasing, but it\u2019s not too late to get in. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer depends on what you want to accomplish in your life. If you want to be successful, I'm going to tell you to go to Tampa. Why? Tampa is one of the fastest growing cities in the nation. Business Inc. recently listed Tampa as one of the top ten cities to move to. Tampa is building out around downtown and around the Tampa Bay area. There is plenty of opportunity in real estate, entrepreneurship, hospitality, tourism, and event management. You can move to Miami but there\u2019s sort of a monopoly there in terms of economic employment and being able to speak Spanish. Miami is very pricey to live there, however it's a great city to party in. Miami does have a lot of successful businesses but it's frankly not the vibe of people I'm looking for. I've known plenty of people and businesses that have moved from Miami to Tampa recently. ",
