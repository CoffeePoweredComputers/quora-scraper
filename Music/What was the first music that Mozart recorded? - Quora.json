            "answer_text": "Do us a favour , look up Mozart\u2019s birthdate and date of death and then look up the date of the first ever recording. Mozart was long dead before recorded sound. He transcribed music that he heard - now this is difficult. His musical brain was so extraordinary that he could write out inner parts to complicated harmonies. Young Wolfie was a genius. Hi early musical compositions aren\u2019t that interesting, but then he wasn\u2019t even 5 years old. ",

            "answer_text": "There is none. Mozart died in 1791; the first gramophone wasn't invented until the 1870s. The first great composer to make a recording for it was Brahms; apparently the sound quality is so bad you can barely make out some snatches of words and music. Truly great recordings of classical works started to appear in the 1930s; the oldest one I've ever heard is a remastering on CD of a 1937 performance of Brahms\u2019s Op. 51 quartets. ",
