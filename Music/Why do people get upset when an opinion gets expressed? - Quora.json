            "answer_text": "Reactions reflect a person\u2019s beliefs, worldview, and experiences. While many say \u201cothers are entitled to their opinion\u201d that does not mean the opinion is perceived as correct. When I say correct, I mean \u201cmorally right\u201d and or \u201cgrounded in fact\u201d which are the two standards typically used to judge the validity of an opinion. As a race, humans tend to judge. We tend to apply our beliefs to others with limited understanding and knowledge of another\u2019s circumstance. So we can make a statement such as \u201cI am tolerant of all beliefs,\u201d while in the next breath say, \u201cI am intolerant of those who actively hate.\u201d I believe this tendency to judgment is a reflection of our lack of self-forgiveness. Maybe we feel ashamed or guilty over something in our past (this can apply to personal guilt/shame, such as stealing a cookie from the jar, as well as collective guilt/shame, such as the oppression of a ruling class over masses). Until we utilize empathy and apply compassion based on individual context, we cannot come to a right understanding and even then, there are limits to what we can know. While it may be upsetting for someone to express judgment, the best course is to utilize empathy and compassion for them. That person is doing the best they can. They feel they are right, and from their limited understanding, they may appear to be so (note: we all have limited understanding). The liberal use of patience, love, and humility innoculate one from frustration, anger, and judgment, no matter what someone\u2019s opinion may be. ",

            "answer_text": "Reasons: The person didn\u2019t ask for your opinion and you are pointing a flaw.You may be attacking his character in the way you frame the opinion, or so he perceives it.The thing you point out is connected with an emotional issue that is not evident.You have a history of arguing this point and now that person reacts historically to what you say. Little things over time that create an emotional charge.Something else.Usually when someone reacts negatively to what you say it is the tone and the way you say it that creates the backlash. If you sound arrogant, dismissive, implying ignorance, over stating, pushing it over and over again, etc. Don\u2019t forget to ask for feedback. When talking say: \u201cDo you follow?\u201d \u201cDo you have a question?\u201d\u201dAre we in agreement until this point?\u201d\u201dWhat do you think about x?\u201d Hope that helps! Let me know if you agree or disagree with any point! ",
