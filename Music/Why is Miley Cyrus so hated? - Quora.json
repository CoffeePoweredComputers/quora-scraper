            "answer_text": "Some reasons: Public stunts she has gotten away with that the average person would be jailed for - there is a lot of footage of her fingering her ex girlfriend Stella Maxwell in public. They looked at the people watching them and continued with their lewd act. Had this been anyone else who isn\u2019t a celebrity, they would have gone straight to jail. Same goes for marijuana and all her drug habits which people are still getting jailed for, while she gets to walk around with no care in the world, acting in a degenerate fashion and profiting off of it with a networth in the $200 million range (because we all know very well society rewards stupidity,ie, Kardashians etc.).Her entire family is testimony to how far nepotism will get someone. Hannah Montana is the show that gave her the platform to play a likable character. The theme of the show (having a secret identity) is a very alluring theme we see in superhero movies that are also hits and such a show was bound to be a hit regardless of the actress playing the role. Alyson Stoner also auditioned for the part, though Miley landed it as she had a famous father who auditioned for the part with her. Her entire family has a foot in entertainment now. Her mother and older sister with their own show (hmm, I wonder how that happened), her younger sister singing on stages most talented artists in the US will never get to sing on because of her last name. Later, to play the victim, Billy Ray claims Hannah Montana \u201cdestroyed\u201d their family while filming and sent her off to the deep end, when the reality is that show went on for a long 6 years. They wanted to make the big bucks. If they had an issue with it as they claim, they would have done something before touring and those 6 years of being on the show and Hannah Montana movies, which her parents were the producers and managers of. Her Bangerz phase was a coping mechanism? Yet her younger sister is doing worse when it comes to promiscuity, despite not having grown up in the public eye with a good girl image. That is because this depraved \u201cphase\u201d wasn\u2019t a phase. Her whole family including parents have slept around and had children in their teens with other people they\u2019ve married before each other. One, Christopher Cody, is a child of Billy\u2019s one night stand (though Billy Ray doesn\u2019t pay attention to Christopher even though he\u2019s his first son). Only the rich and famous kids of his second wife, Tish Cyrus, get attention. They know very well sex and outrage sells and Miley used that to her advantage, despite her claiming that was done in order to shed a Hannah Montana image, which she could have easily done in a rock or country scene without tossing off all her clothes to intentionally cause controversy. Most people prefer dignity and humility, while having less sympathy for the spoiled who get life easy and then pretend to be victims of the very things that allow them to live a comfortably luxurious lifestyle in the first place.Interesting the kinds of things people will do for money, then play the victim in the end while buying a $100,000 black diamond nail polish bottle, isn\u2019t it?",

            "answer_text": "She just did what Madonna did thirty years before her when she sang \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d on live television, writhing on the ground in a wedding dress. Back then she was a hero and role model to millions of adoring teens who emulated her look. They started wearing lingerie and crucifixes in public. She was bold, edgy, uninhibited, and sexually liberating. She made being slutty cool. But there's a line between bad girl slutty, and indecency. Christina Aguilera was harshly criticized for a video she came out with in 2002 called dirrty. I haven't watched the whole video, but I remember a comment about it from someone (I forget who) that the video made you feel like you needed to take a shower after watching it. It was borderline pornographic. I haven't followed Miley Cyrus's career, but even I've seen the \u201craunchy grinding\u201d with Robin Thicke. When you say Miley Cyrus, my mental image of her is on stage sticking out her derriere as if begging to be f#$cked. I think the difference between a Cardi B and Miley is that Cardi has always been a skank ho, but Miley was Hannah freakin' Montana. It's this loss of innocence that makes her transformation that much more difficult to watch. I feel like many other celebrities are trying to check her and trying to let her know: Miley, it's not too late to get some class and start behaving like a lady.  ",
