For a long time I felt Without style and graceWearing shoes with no socks In cold weatherI knew my heart Was in the right placeI knew I'd be able To do these things And as we watch him Digging his own graveIt is important to know That was where he's atHe can't afford to stopThat is what he believeHe'll keep on digging For a thousand years I'm walking a lineI'm thinking about empty motionI'm walking a lineJust barely enough to be livingGet outta the way (no time to begin) This isn't the time (so nothing was done)Not talking about (not many at all)I'm turning around (no trouble at all)You notice there's nothing around you, 'round youI'm walking a lineDivide and dissolve Never get to say muchNever get to talkTell us a little bitBut not too muchRight about thenIs where she give upShe has closed her eyesShe has give up hope I'm walking a lineI hate to be dreaming in motionI'm walking a lineJust barely enough to be livingGet outta the way (no time to begin) This isn't the time (so nothing was done)Not talking about (not many at all)I'm turning around (no trouble at all)I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind meI'm walking a lineDivide and dissolve ",

Lyrics: Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming The goddess of imaginary light In my field of paper flowers And candy clouds of lullaby I lie inside myself for hours And watch my purple sky fly over me I linger in the doorway Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name Let me stay, where the wind will whisper to me Where the raindrops as they\u2019re falling tell a story If you need to leave the world you live in Lay your head down and stay awhile Though you may not remember dreaming Something waits for you to breathe again In my field of paper flowers And candy clouds of lullaby I lie inside myself for hours And watch my purple sky fly over me I love this song so much. It perfectly describes me and what I do everyday: daydream. Link to the song: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zsGo_1lTdww Sorry, turns out the link doesn\u2019t work, just go on Youtube and search \u201cEvanescence Imaginary Origin Version\u201d.
