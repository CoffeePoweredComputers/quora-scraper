            "answer_text": "The government put out the Warren Commission Report as the end all be all Oswald did it by himself story. It was the prosecution case put forth by the government since Oswald had been killed. The WCR was distorted, misleading, and foisted upon the American people as gospel. But there are always two sides to every story, so without government sanction, the rebuttal of the Warren Commission Report came out. It wasn\u2019t organized as such, but scrutiny showed numerous faults in the WCR. Facts that had been hidden from public view began to emerge. People that the government had forced personnel to sign oath of silence, finally came forward. The false narrative of the WCR was finally being revealed by the truth. Still, to this day, the WCR stands as fact, according to the government. And to this day, President Johnson stated that the Gulf of Tonkin Incident was North Vietnamese patrol boats attacking US ships. This is what LBJ stated to the US Congress, knowing full well he had received a later telegram stating it was waves slapping against the ships, misinterpreted as an attack. LBJ LIED TO CONGRESS TO GET HIS WAR. The WCR is the same lie by the Johnson government to the US people. The government is afraid of its own people finding out the truth about the assassination. Their phony little story that people can\u2019t accept that a little worm of a man could topple the greatest leader in the world, isn\u2019t working any more. I can hear the mantra now, it is all in the WCR. It damn well isn\u2019t. How many people sent to prison for murder and rape have been set free with DNA evidence that wasn\u2019t available when they were found guilty? The US should be truthful, but keeps key evidence locked up that shows the WCR to be false. But instead of releasing these files, they claim national security I\u2019ve given up on my government being truthful in my life time. ",

            "answer_text": "It probably started within seconds of the last shot when everyone ran towards the grassy knoll where they felt the shots came from. You can see this for yourself in some of the movie footage from that moment and the first radio broadcasts all had the shooter in the grassy knoll. We all tend to be like sheep and know with total certainty the honesty and truthfulness when the government tells us anything. If our leaders say Oswald was a lone nut shooter, or there was a magic bullet, or our ship was attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin or you can keep your insurance and your rates are going to go down that those are facts not to be questioned. So for a long time we accepted that Oswald was a nut case and not a patsy. We had the Warren Commission to give us full details. The fact that it was staffed with people who didn\u2019t like JFK and according to some of us nutcases may have actually been part of the plot. The fact that witnesses whose story didn\u2019t fit the facts they set out to show were either never called or committed suicide by shooting themselves in the back 6 times didn\u2019t matter. We had full details except of course for the reams of documents that were sealed for generations. There were of course questions. For example the magic bullet which entered JFK\u2019s back traveling downward at about 25 degrees, then traveled upward exiting JFK\u2019s neck, then traveled downwards hitting Connolly near the 5th rib, then into his wrist and thigh and then magically fell off the stretcher in pristine condition. The gun that changed manufacturers, the botched autopsy, the silencing of Oswald, the endless string of odd circumstances that seemed to show people knew in advance, the fact Oswald was seen in the lunch room 45 seconds after the shooting as well as 5 minutes before the shooting. Most accepted the official story until Mark Lane\u2019s book came out and that launched a lot of questions that have been talked about in later books. There are so many questions that do make me think that we conspiracy nuts may not be quite as crazy as the sheep would want us to believe. ",
