            "answer_text": "Most in Hip Hop, Pop and R&B do program beats but that's not the primary role of a Producer. A Beat Maker in Hip Hop that creates the instrumental track were oringally reffered to as Programmer\u2019s that programmed and sequenced backing tracks with the use of Drum Machines, Samplers and Synthesizer keyboards. Making beats alone however doesn't necessary make you a Producer.  A Producer is like a director in Film or TV as the primary role of a Record Producer is to oversee the entire production of a song that produces the record and help bring the song to its highest level as possible. The Producer sees every aspect of making record from the beginning stages all the way to the end as the finished product that works closely with the Vocalist and Musicians in the studio. The Producer typically works along side a Pro-Tools Recording Engineer in the control room behind the mixing console directing, calling the shots. They help realise an Artists vision, assist the vocalist or musician to help capture the right engery and performance, arrange the vocals, may assist in the Songwriting and Arranging process of the music, help select the right songs to be produced, may hire musicians, may act or full fill the role as a musician, programmer, arranger, songwriter, conductor or an Engineer. Producer's comes from all types of different backgrounds depending on the genre and their skill set as some can be hands on while some are hands off. A Record Producer in Urban Hip Hop / R&B / Pop such as Rodney Jerkins, Teddy Reily, Dr. Dre, Scott Storch, Timbaland combines the role of a Programmer that creates the instrumental track and a Record Producer that oversees the recording process that produces the record in the studio with the Rapper or Singer. This type of Record Producer is what you call a Songwriter Producer. Sean Diddy Combs and Rick Rubin are hands off Producer's as they aren't necessary the guy that program beats. Puff is like the director that calls the shots behind the board trying to get good vocals out of a Rapper or Singer. Then you have Technical Producer's such as Jimmy Douglas that wears both the Record Producer and Engineers. Technical Producer's are common in Rock and Country genres. Then you have your Classic Arranger / Record Producer's like Quincy Jones and Ron Fair that are accomplished Musicians, Arrangers, Conductors. They hire musicians, act as musicians, arranges the music and can write arrangments on manuscript and conduct the ochestra. I\u2019m a combination of all of them as I wear many hats myself. I'm mostly a Producer / Songwriter but I'm also an Arranger, Programmer, Engineer and Musician. ",

            "answer_text": "The expression, \u201cmaking beats\u201d is used almost exclusively in hip hop and it is synonymous with composition, songwriting, scoring, writing music, or creating a jingle. In years past, producers had creative ability and were able to compose, but their focus was always managing all of the personnel involved to get to a finished track that could be sold. Today, however, all of the work can be performed by one or a few people. It's very common for people to possess all of the composition, technical, and production skills required to create, finish, and publish a song from beginning to end. As a result, they are acting as the producer and happen to be also performing all of the tasks that were handled by separate writers, instrumentalists, session players, recording technicians, audio engineers, performers, mixers, mastering artists, publishing managers, artist agents, artist managers, marketing agents, promoters, publishers, distributors, and retailers. All of these technically fall under the heading of production, so the person owning the process is the producer. If that's you, you're the producer. If you're writing music for that guy in hip hop, you're making beats. I can think of no amateurs who are only making beats. You really need to master all of the skills to be successful anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "You can't make a \u201cbeat\u201d nor can anyone else. Saying \u201cI make beats\u201d is the same as saying \u201cI make seconds, minutes or hours\u201d. A beat is a measurement of time with a start, a middle, and an end. It's possible for the pulse of a beat to be changed and that is referred to as the tempo. Most pop music is written with tempos of between 100 to 120 beats per minutes. Once a songwriter determines the tempo those are all the beats you are ever going to get. The beat it self at this point is silent. For proof of this start clapping your hands in a steady time. Now you can hear and feel the pulse of the music (aka tempo) but the beat is silent as it's the space between the claps. What you are doing when you say you are making \u201cbeats\u201d is subdividing the \u201cpulse\u201d of the music. This is called a rhythm. A rhythm is a pattern and can be something as simple as clapping on the beginning of the pulse or not or sub dividing the pulse a thousand different ways. ",
