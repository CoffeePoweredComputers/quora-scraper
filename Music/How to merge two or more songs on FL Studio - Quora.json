            "answer_text": "Import both songs into a new FL session file and save it as \"Live Set\"or something along those lines: You could bounce each song as individual stems (ie. vocals, drums, synths etc.) for each track in the song and reassemble them in this \"live set\" or just bounce the song as a whole.  Now you have the arrangements in one session file make sure the tempo grid is set for each. If there is a speed up/slow down between each song use automation to adjust the grid between them. Once tempo matched you can start adjusting the space between the tracks and add any fade in/out content to begin blending them. Hope this helps ",

It's a mixing app for FL Studio. You can also try using Virtual DJ which is a good DJing software. ",
