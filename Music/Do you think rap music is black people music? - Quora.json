            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean. Rap as a genre came to life as a combination of many musical styles that came before it, many that were indeed created and popularized by African Americans (gospel, jazz, soul, rock and roll, disco, reggae). The socio-economic forces that created the atmosphere around which rap music came into its own in the South Bronx largely affected African and Americans and people of Caribbean decent \u2014 and to a great degree, Hispanic Americans as well. But yes, the creation, growth and popularization of the genre was largely fueled by the talents, voices and perspectives of African Americans. In that regard, rap music is, as was jazz and rock and roll, \u201cblack people music.\u201d However, rap has always been enjoyed by a wide variety of people, including many non-African Americans. Indeed, several successful artists in hip-hop have been white or Hispanic and much of the genre\u2019s consumers over the years have been white. The expansion of rap music into popular culture, has widened its appeal even greater, so that today, much of pop music is rap-influenced, made and enjoyed by people from all ethnicities. So, the answer is, yes, at its core, the creation of rap music should almost completely be attributed to African Americans. At the same time, as it has grown into a form of expression that has crossed all boundaries \u2014 ethnic, linguistic, geographic \u2014 it is not a genre that is exclusive to African Americans. ",

            "answer_text": "Rap is black music.   Does that mean non Black people can\u2019t participate? No, sir. It does not, but it is Black music. Incidentally, I don\u2019t agree with everything the god, Jamar, says but I respect him 500 percent. And he doesn\u2019t lie like a lot of the rap Toms. A lot of them will say whatever in an interview, because they are mentally castrated. And for the first time in Us musical history, mostly due to the change in demographics of the US population and the decision of Black people to continue to rap: rap has stayed mostly Black. Most Black kids in the hood don\u2019t really fuck with White artists, because they can\u2019t relate and White artists don\u2019t have to deal with Black rage, white supremacy and rampant depression everyday. It is what it is. Here\u2019s the thing though hip hop in all its\u2019 forms was popularized by three groups of people of Black descent: Jamaicans (Kool Dj Here with the dub plates that lead to all DJ culture worldwide)Black AmericasBoricuasIn addition, Graf was always multicultural from the very beginning. Rappers were not my role models coming up. When cats first started rapping, there were all mostly dead broke doing house parties and mixtapes. 95 percent of the emcees were eating massive shit living with they Moms in the PJS\u2014 projects. MY HEROES COMING UP were these people.  LADY PINK  LEE QUINONES  DONDI WHITE When I wanted to learn my letters, my father had this blond French- American kid teach me my letters. If I hadn\u2019t of learned how to draw my letters, I would have never made it. Dead or in jail. The streets were bad. Now they\u2019re worse.    Those two books above were my guide after I learned my letters. Most of the graf writers doing pieces when I came up were Puerto Rican or White. I would like to lie and say it was because of money. It was NOT. Most of the Black kids who wrote just wanted to tag, fight and do throw ups. My experience. And brothers can pretend that\u2019s not what we did, but we mostly smoked lye, tagged and ducked sirens. Self hate and black rage are horrendous. FOH. The purpose of all aspects of hip hop is to do something positive besides running the streets , killing yourself or killing other people. The rap game has hijacked hip hop for a long time. Rap is not hip hop. That\u2019s it. ",
