            "answer_text": "You should feel air moving steadily through your throat. You should feel a loose jaw. Your lips should be loose not drawn back-not even for an \u201ceee\u201d sound. You should feel your lower back ribs stretching OOUUT OOUUT OUUT (as you sing, not as you breathe in). You should feel the base of your spine stretching DOWN DOWN DOWN, as you tuck your butt under with more and more effort (again, as you sing). As you breathe in, you should feel you are breathing into the space you will need for the coming phrase\u2019s highest note. You should rely on your teacher\u2019s advice on how well you are doing. Your teacher may use very different language from mine, but that\u2019s all right. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends what kind of music you sing. For most genres it does not matter as long as you sound great. The classical approach is different though. Everything matters. Jaw needs to be relaxed, easy moving. Tongue needs to be soft (feel underneath chin for base of tongue. That should always be soft. The diaphragm you won\u2019t feel. You control it in the same way you control breathing. Anymore questions, fire away! :) ",
