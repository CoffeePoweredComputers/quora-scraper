            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. What was the very first DVD you bought? When I acquired my first player, I rented a copy of Memento. The performance wasn\u2019t up to what I expected, and the retailer accused the rental disc of being the cause of the problem. Therefore, I went out and purchased a brand new copy of exactly the same movie, and the machine still demonstrated the same faults. The was when a replacement machine was offered. Memento is a great movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who can keep track of the time jumps in the way it was edited. The next DVDs I purchased (simultaneously) were The Sound of Music (Special Edition) and The Exorcist (Extended). The look on the face of the sales clerk was that of severe confusion. ",

            "answer_text": "My very first DVD was Starship Troopers.  I chose this film as my first DVD due to the amount of CGI imagery used, to specifically test how good the images would look on the home screen. This was back in the day when some DVDs required you to turn them over midway through the film, and Starship Troopers was one of those discs. Interestingly, it\u2019s also the only DVD I\u2019ve owned which required you to turn over to see the rest of the film. I have other discs that feature a different version of the film on the reverse side, and some discs that feature two different films on either side, but none that stop midway through to turn over. ",
