            "answer_text": "There are two characters in Stardust Crusaders I would say I hate, and while they are two very different characters, my reasons are largely the same. Spoiler warning for Part 3 up front. First of all, the one that isn't controversial, is Anne.  Anne is a runaway girl who stows away with the Joestar group to see the world, and gets caught up in all of their fights from Hong Kong to Pakistan. In this time, she contributes nothing to the party, whines and complains at every turn, and is frequently targeted by the villains, requiring the real heroes to save her. Anne is allegedly the comic relief kid tag-along, but never does anything funny. She instead gets an unbelievably uncomfortable nude scene where a Stand-using orangutan tries to rape her (yes, seriously), hangs around for a while in the background, and then gets unceremoniously tossed on her ass into an airplane about a third of the way into the Part. She is such a non-character that she didn't even have a name in the manga, that's how little of a purpose she had. Ditching her early on was one of the few wise moves Stardust Crusaders made before arriving in Egypt. Now onto the second character, who is no doubt going to be a lot more contentious: Jean Pierre Polnareff.  Now you might say, how can I hate Polnareff? He's such a lovable rogue, so funny, so badass, who could possibly hate Polnareff? Well I do, because he's Anne with a punchghost. Polnareff is not a helpful addition to the Crusaders. He wanders off on his own, gets in fights with Stand-users he can't beat, and either has to miserably limp his way to victory (Ebony Devil, Thoth) or have another Crusader bail him out, usually at great personal injury (Hanged Man, Justice, Sethan). In fights where he actually does stay with the party, he almost never contributes positively, and just kind of stands in the background cheerleading. He also isn't a very sympathetic character, either. His backstory has him hunting the man who raped and murdered his sister, again pulling that \"rape as drama\" card I hate so much in machismo stories, and that really doesn't carry him that far. Once J Geil dies, his arc is completed. You could argue that he undergoes character development by avenging Avdol (a character I liked way more than Polnareff) and learning to take responsibility for his actions, but after Araki chickened out by retconning Avdol's apparent death, any development he'd undergone is undone. There are no consequences to anything Polnareff does, he's just here to eat up time. And that leads me to another point I hate about Polnareff: better characters suffer because of his actions. His hotheadedness gets Avdol killed not once, but twice, and the second time sticks. He completely blows Jotaro's plan to bait DIO into attacking, which admittedly prompts a really cool scene where Jotaro stops his own heart, but that was entirely to save Polnareff's bacon. Even Iggy the farting dog is more dignified in his death scene than Polnareff is in the entire fight surrounding it. Now in the interest of fairness, sometimes you don't have to be a compelling character to be likable in Jojo, sometimes you just need a cool power. I mean, come on, Silver Chariot is great! It's fast, it's precise, it can deliver a flurry of attacks\u2026 and it's just an unevolved Star Platinum, except it deals piercing damage instead of bludgeoning. Oh, it can drop its defenses to go faster and perform the Shadow Clone Jutsu? That would be a bonus if he ever did either of those things when it mattered. He doesn't, because as stated above, Polnareff is never allowed to contribute positively to anything. Speaking of resemblances to Jotaro, it's clear Araki wanted to make Polnareff the protagonist. He gets at least as many scenes to himself as the supposed Jojo of the Part, maybe even more. People often complain about Crusaders-era Jotaro being a boring character, but I don't necessarily agree. His fights against Steely Dan, D'arby and DIO are among the best Jojo has to offer! It's just that he gets no screentime because a French cylinder that thinks it's a person keeps stealing his spotlight. When I rewatch Stardust Crusaders with friends, I often curate it to skip the \"filler\" episodes. The overlap between \"filler\" and \"Polnareff-centric\" is so large, Kakyoin ends up getting more episodes, and he barely got any attention from Araki! I think this comic by Dantecries on Tumblr should more or less tell you everything I have to say about Polnareff.    ",

            "answer_text": "Late to this question but decided to go at it for fun. In JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, there are two characters that I actually have a huge hatred for. Hate is a strong word, I know, but these two characters get me furious.  First of all, Vanilla Ice. If I was in a room with a helpless Vanilla Ice and I had lethal weapons, I would make Vanilla Ice die in the slowest, most painful way. This sounds harsh but even a word like hate can\u2019t describe the way I felt watching Vanilla Ice. So it\u2019s the end of Part 3, the Stardust Crusaders are finally about to encounter DIO and initiate the final battle. Out of the blue, DIO\u2019s cheap Pucci gay-lover kind of douchebag comes out of nowhere and kills Avdol, FOR THE SECOND TIME! ALMOST KILLS POLNAREFF (WHICH GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK), AND THEN ADDS THE DOUCHY CHERRY ON TYPE BY KILLING IGGY!! WHO DOES THAT!? I genuinely hate Vanilla Ice. I had to reread DIO\u2019s World because I couldn\u2019t see through the tears in my eyes after Vanilla Ice and Cream. And then they pull out the Kill Kakyoin card right after this. This was the only time I actually almost dropped JoJo\u2019s temporarily to take a break.  The second character I hate is Shigechi. To be honest, Harvest is a cool Stand and one that I\u2019d want in real life. But Shigechi as a character is so annoying. I don\u2019t hate him as much as Vanilla Ice, not even close. But he\u2019s an annoying, immature child who tried to literally kill Josuke and Okuyasu over a little bit of Yen. The amount of satisfaction I got after Josuke and Okuyasu got their revenge felt so good. However, after rereading Part 4 a few times, I really started to appreciate Shigechi more. After I really saw how much he contributed to finding Kira, and how is he didn\u2019t die, the hunt for Kira would probably never happen. But I still hate him. ",

            "answer_text": "DIO Brando. [Beep] DIO Brando. Let me tell you how much I hate DIO. If the word 'HATE' was engraved on every nanometer of my veins and arteries, that would not even equal one billionth of the amount of hate I feel for DIO. Hate. Hate. For DIO. Hate. Hate. hate. Hate. But for real though, let me tell you why I hate DIO. He has a baseless reason to be evil. He resorts to being evil and doing unto others what was one unto him baselessly. He developed a hatred for someone who never wronged him. DIO\u2019s only reason to be evil is because he wants to be powerful and prove himself better than others. There\u2019s no backing to it. He has no substantial roots to hold himself up.A lot of personal things have happened between me and people who liked DIO genuinely and unironically. I have met people who felt they could relate to him, and I understand it mildly, being someone who has gone through what DIO did. However, for me it brings me no cause to do harm to others just because of how a couple people have treated me. The people who I have met that love DIO, though, have latched unto him excessively unhealthily and it bothered me so. These people also happened to gain bad behaviors that made being friends with them unsafe. I know some people can be respectful and sane lovers of villainous characters, but my experiences with DIO fans have been pretty awful and ruined any chances of me liking him.The goal OF DIO is to be disliked anyway. And I\u2019m guilty of falling into this trap. DIO is an awful character with absolutely no redeeming qualities, in my eyes, heart, or soul. Shigechi, Valentine, or even Vanilla Ice are far more likeable characters in comparison.The one character that outranks DIO is Alessi, as a special mention. I was forced to skip watching the Alessi\u2019s Set arcs because of how uncomfortable he made me feel. There\u2019s reasons why, but they\u2019re linked to private things from my past.",

            "answer_text": "Alright boys, here we go. I love almost all of the characters in JoJo. Almost. There are three characters I have the hugest hate for. Some characters I dislike, some I dislike a lot, but they have redeeming qualities. But there are three I just hate with pure passion. First up, we got this monkey.  Tooru from JoJolion. Now, I'd understand why someone would like him. I totally do. But man oh man does this dirty cottonswab get under my skin, and it's for one reason. His chemistry with Yasuho. I know they dated in the past, blah blah, but the fact he's still trying to get with Yasuho. That just makes enraged. I just hate his stupid face. I know it may be pretty, but Yasuho and Josuke are a power couple at this point. I don't want this ball of hair you find in a shower drain getting in the way. He can die the most depressing death for all I care. Next up we got,  Part 3 Joseph Joestar. The lobotomized, empty shell of an actually interesting and humorous person we once knew, now downsized to a brainless \u201cOh my God!\u201d spewing machine. Part 3 Joseph holds a special place in my hateful heart due to the fact he's just an idiotic old man with nothing funny or witty to say aside from yelling the same English lines over and over. It gets old real quick, and it's a real shame too. We could've had something greater, but Araki slipped up and made this horrid travesty aside from someone likeable. And I wanted to like this Joseph. Part 4 Joseph was a better character than this garbo. And Hermit Purple is a trash stand with one of the most boring designs and an ability that is only used for one thing without being that creative. I would've put part 3 Jotaro here too, but he at least had some interesting interactions and whatnot. But now, we move on to my most hated character. The worst of the worst. The bane of my existence.  Ken Oyanagi. Literally the worst character in JoJo, at least in my opinion. Never, have I been so annoyed, so angered, so distraught while reading an arc. He is literally the most unlikable character in part 4, in all of JoJo. I was overjoyed to see him cry, and to see him get decked by Rohan. I felt bad for Rohan, Rohan Kishibe, the guy who is the personification of Squidward if Spongebob and Patrick was everyone on earth except for Koichi. Ken is the most unlikeable thing I've ever seen. He whined and complained whenever Rohan wouldn't play Janken, cried when he lost, and became even more unbearable later one when he started winning. Then he disrespects my bro Shizuka, and when that didn't work out, tried committing suicide. Whoopee. Honestly, I got so frustrated with this disgusting brat I skipped some of the anime episodes he's in. This man is the worst thing to ever have appeared, and I will continue to hate him forever. ",

Well let\u2019s start off with describing his problems and you can assume who it is. So he for one, has a constantly restarting character arc. His arc is complete, but Akari loves him so much he refuses to give him up. He hogged so much screen time, and results in a few character deaths. He often blames his absence in judgement on others, and he is a waste of his stand. Its polnareff. In every way he is flawed. Starting off with silver chariot. A pretty cool stand and one of my favorites. Even when he killed vanilla ice, i refuse to see it a polnareff killing him, it was silver chariot. A lesser version of star platinum, but unlike star platinum his character can\u2019t shut up. Even at his introduction, silver chariot was more interesting. \u201cSomeone randomly raped and murdered my sister I must take revenge\u201d vs the cool ass knight who can increase his speed, launch his blades, faster than most, and could go toe to toe with avdol. polnareff is Akaris go to if he wants to kill a character. He tried it with Avdol, but regretted it, and then realized \u201c I have 2 characters, my annoying jerk off, and flame Egyptian. Someone gotta die or people won\u2019t take things seriously. BUT WHOS GONNA DIE IF POLNAREFF ISNT AROUND!\u201d And with that, avdol gets sent to his retconnable death. Atleast with that he saved one of the better characters, iggy. Within iggies one episode against pet shop, he got more development than polnareff ever got. He limps to the team to warn them, and ACTUALLY FORWARDS THE PLOT. Instead, iggy gets a pointless death, and polnareff gets angry and gets an undeserved victory. HE DOESNT EVEN KILL HIM. He lets the sun do that. Maybe because they didn\u2019t want to reveal the whole vampires can die thing. But, both avdol and iggy had more interesting arcs, personalities, and actually forwarded the plot, unlike popnareff. his repeating character arc? He can\u2019t ever learn his lesson. Avdol nearly dies because of him, and avdol says \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d You would think that he is now improved and fixed. No he\u2019s not he goes back to his immature ways and both avdol and iggy die for him to once again fail to be mature. HE EVEN HAS FORCED PLOT. Wouldn\u2019t avdol and iggy be cooler to meet dio at the start? Avdol for plot and iggy for follow up. But no, polnareff accidentally pulls the sword and attacks jotaro. And does way to well against a character way stronger than him. His arc should have finished with him dying with his sisters killer, and avdol surviving. the better outcome? Avdol burns him like a bitch. Avdol doesn\u2019t spare polnareff, mainly because the reason he did it was completely forgotten. Avdol soared because polnareff is honorable. Does polnareff show any honor in later episodes? No. Character seems like a filler comic relief that failed horribly. He never forwards plot and actively acts against it, making him more of an antagonist than dio. ",

Also he hits Pesci whenever he gets scared or freaks out like what the fuck!!!!! Prosciutto is like \u201coh I\u2019m doing it cause I care about you\u201d shut your bitch ass up prosciutto that\u2019s bullshit. If you were actually a good mentor you wouldn\u2019t have to hit him. You shouldn\u2019t even have to resort to that. Of course he\u2019s going to freak out they\u2019re in the middle of a fight ok sorry he\u2019s not emotionally prepared to fucking murder people and fight others. He lectured Pesci for fucking drinking milk. Fucking milk. What the literal fuck is wrong with you. Milk is good for your bones and gives you calcium and prevents you from getting osteoporosis you stupid fuck. If he wants to drink milk let him you overnight bastard fuckwad. Another character I despise is Diavolo. Now I do not hate doppio though. In fact doppio is one of my most favorite characters who I absolutely deeply care about. Diavolo was a piece of shit and a coward. He always hid behind doppio and doppio always takes most of the hits Diavolo should fucking get. He abandoned doppio all alone. That scene made me fucking bawl. I don\u2019t think Diavolo deserves the death loop but he deserves to pay for his actions one way or another. He also killed Abbachio and bruno as well two of my other favorite characters. He tried murdering his own daughter which is unforgivable. He hurt his own daughter. You should never hurt your own children. Never. ",

            "answer_text": "I really don\u2019t like Narscio from part 6 for multiple reasons: He breaks up the character dynamic present in part 6. I really think Jolyne, Hermes, and FF had one of the best dynamics of any Jojo squad. And the fact that they were all women added an element missing from the series so far. Then add an occasional guest star of Enporio and Weather Report and you\u2019ve got a really solid crew with Jotaro showing up at the very end. Almost mirroring the Stardust Crusaders from part 3 (appropriate since part 6 is basically a sequel to part 3). Unfortunately as soon as Narscio shows up he breaks that up entirely, Hermes basically disseapears for the rest of the part as does Enporio.His \u201cthing\u201d is not funny. Maybe it\u2019s a Japanese thing but I don\u2019t fine Narscio\u2019s obsession with Jolyne funny, like at all. Especially since it\u2019s validated in a way in the end with their marriage in the reset universe. Not only does it break up the character dynamic as mentioned above but JoJo does not need a romantic subplot (I haven\u2019t read part 8 yet so maybe Araki does it better there.) I find it especially egregious since the only female Jojo also happens to be the one with the romantic subplot.His Stand sucks. This is a problem a lot of part 6 has in general but his sucks the most of any of the main cast. And the main reason is I still don\u2019t know fully how it works or what it\u2019s limitations are. If it can \u201cdive\u201d into anything and change any aspect of it shouldn\u2019t it be the most broken thing ever: diving into an opponent and changing their heart into a rock or something.Narscio sucks.

He probably got double the screen of josuke when he's half as interesting. It was good to see his growth but even at the end of the part he's annoying. He also suffers from \u201chave to explain everything that is going on in the fight\u201d syndrome. He basically Speedwagon 2.0 but if Speedwagon was given more importance than Jonathan. And also koichi has no dignity. ",
