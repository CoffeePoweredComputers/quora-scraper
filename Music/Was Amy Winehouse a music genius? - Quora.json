            "answer_text": "Simple Answer! Nope far from it. More elaborate answer! Well although Amy Winehouse had a fantastic voice, she did nothing we\u2019ve not heard before. And for all the credit she gets for her hit album Back to Black she gets, Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi deserve just as much, if not more for building the Album around her voice, (otherwise she just becomes another Duffy) which like I say is fantastic but she was a mere Billie Holiday impressionist in my book.

That voice was from another dimension. Her songs that were SO different yet pulled together so many influences\u2026.she was an incredible naturally gifted songwriter, truly a musical genius who sadly didn\u2019t realise how great she was.
