            "answer_text": "There are many K-Pop companies in the industry but they\u2019re often split into larger and smaller ones. Don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware or not, but there\u2019s the Big 3 which include SM, YG and JYP. These larger companies host and produce the more well-known and successful groups. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that smaller companies are less competent. There are several smaller companies such as : Starship, BigHit, Pledis etc. Starship has Monsta X and Sistar; BigHit has BTS; Pledis has Seventeen and Pristin, and all these are groups that are popular right now. But if you\u2019re directing this to a foreigner, I\u2019ll have to say smaller companies. Now, K-pop is quite strict on the \u201cKorean Beauty Standard\u201d but the larger companies tend to look at looks more compared to smaller companies. By this I mean, they prefer to take in someone who is close to the standards and that tends to lean on someone who has asian facial features. Larger companies have less foreigners, as in not of asian descent. SM has close to no foreigners in their company, same goes to JYP and YG only has a couple of artists in the American Branch. Smaller companies may give foreigners a chance if they really exceed their expectation as they\u2019re desperate to put a group in their market so they won\u2019t get broke and earn some profit and garner some attention for future trainees and groups. That being said, being a trainee, hell even getting past round 2 is extremely hard. It\u2019ll take a toll on you mentally and physically, and be sure to expect dangerous diets where you\u2019ll almost black out from exhaustion or plastic surgery. It\u2019s already hard for asians to get into companies, so I\u2019m pretty sure foreigners will have a much harder time getting in. It\u2019s the cold and harsh truth, and even though it is extremely unfair, the companies have to consider the fan\u2019s reaction, whether it\u2019ll be acceptable to have a such a huge change in the K-pop industry. If being a K-pop trainee is your ultimate dream and you have so much passion, you should step back and consider the pros and cons and look at the different aspects of the industry as it is truly notorious for the rigorous and dangerous training so brace yourself. Nonetheless, give a shot at as many companies as you can so you can maximize your chances of getting into a group. ",

            "answer_text": "this is the ranking list based on my opinion JYP ENTERTAINMENT (JYP NATION) -because this company are looking for character and personalities even if you\u2019re lack at talent but you have good personalities and they see a potential in you congratulation you become a trainee\u2026they also take a good care of you thats why JYP called as the friendliest company when it comes to foreigners..they most likely debut a girl/boy group in every 3 or 4 years..also JYP has many foreigner trainee as well as koreans so it will be hard (but not to hard) for you to debut unless if you have the look,talent,character 2. SM ENTERTAINMENT (SM TOWN) - you have the looks? go to SM they are actually looking for look only as SM said \u201cwe focus on visual more because talents can be made\u201d which is real talents can be made BUT\u2026..BUT\u2026BUT\u2026 if you\u2019re a foreigner and you want them to take care well of you then I dont recommend you to go here for the sake of your life (not trying to ruin the company) one of the ex trainee in SM ENT exposed how SM treats all foreigners (well not all) if you run late or did something against the rule you will have run around the training room while singing..you can also hit in the stomach with a basketball whish sound painful..so if you\u2019re ready to give up on your life try this ENTERTAINMENT If you want to be succesful then go to SM they produces a lot of the biggest kpop idol Lastly 3. YG ENTERTAINMENT (YG FAMILY) - still a lot of YG fans doesnt have a clue of how they treat foreign trainee..and you mostly have a low chance of getting in here because yg has low experienced on having a foreigner in hes company we all know the fact that yg has only -1 foreigner which is BLACKPINK LISA..and also YG prefare talented people which is not surprising just looking at his artist but if you\u2019re really talented prepare to train years and years and years still counting ",
