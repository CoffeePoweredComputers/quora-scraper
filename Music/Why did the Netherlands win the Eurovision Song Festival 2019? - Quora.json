            "answer_text": "It was a really strong vocal performance. This song is not that easy to sing and he nailed it, also he has a very distinctive and beautiful voice. Possibly the best vocals of the competition, only Australia\u2019s Kate Miller-Heidke compares.The lyrics are really poetic, he beautifully compares his love to a game in an arcade which he lost. \u201cSmall-town boy in a big arcade, I got addicted to a losing game\u201d.The music itself is very touching. It starts off very soft and vulnerable, and there\u2019s a big emotional climax towards the end.The song is for everybody. Genre-wise it\u2019s a neutral pop-ballad, and everybody can in some ways relate to the lyrics. For example Italy\u2019s song had more hip-hop elements in it, and not everybody likes that.The staging, while being rather simple for Eurovision standards, was very effective. I love the moment where he gets flooded by very bright light and we only see his silhouette.Competition was slightly less strong at the top than in previous years, it would have been interesting to see him compete in 2018 against Toy and Fuego, or in 2017 against Amar Pelos Dois and Beautiful Mess. Also, Ukraine would have had a really strong entry, sadly they withdrew.This year, there was extreme discrepancy between juries and the televoting, only the Netherlands and Italy made top places in both rankings. Particularly, Norway has won the televoting, but got destroyed by juries.I doubt that the fact that he was naked in the music video made much of a difference. It is true that Eurovision is very popular in the LGBT-community, and you can get points by addressing them (like Ireland in 2018 did unexpectedly well, when they had a male dancing pair). But most of the viewers heard that song for the first time at the competition and haven\u2019t seen the video. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they objectively had the best song that year. They also had the best song in 2014, but the empowering carnival act of a woman with a beard got in the way that year. Some years winning is about the song, some years it\u2019s about the message, and sometimes it\u2019s about the act. ",
