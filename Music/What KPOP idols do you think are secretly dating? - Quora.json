            "answer_text": "Anonymous for obvious reasons. Since I'm tired of my company, might as well spill some tea.  All of the EXO members are dating. Most of them are dating non celebs or influencers/dancers. So if their fans want to know who is dating who, I suggest you keep an eye on korean influencers since a lot of these girls practically give it away. The maknae of the group just recently broke up with his long time girlfriend. Chanyeol is dating on and off (basically just dating around, nothing serious) though he was in a serious relationship with an sm trainee when he debuted. Most of the members are in long term relationships. Chen was on/off with his girlfriend (now wife) for years before they got married. He was planning to propose to her already (before she even got pregnant) to end the on/off cycle. He already asked the company's permission before but SM was struggling on how to make it work or if they should make it public or not. The Baekhyun/Taeyeon scandal was true. Though their relationship wasn\u2019t very serious. And it didn\u2019t really end when it was publicly announced that they broke up. They were on and off also for a few years. The breakup was just for publicity to hopefully stop all the backlash baekhyun was getting. I honestly feel sorry for him since the negativity he got from that scandal kinda traumatized him from dating again since I don\u2019t think we heard him dating anyone after that.   Red velvet members are all in a relationship with actors/idols.  Some of the NCT members are dating, but nothing serious.   No need to mention Super Junior. This is an obvious one. Even fans are asking them to date already.   Bonus tea:  Jimin from BTS is in a long term relationship with someone from G.Friends. A stylist friend told me this and I didn't believe her at first, but other friends from the industry mentioned it too.   Usually idols start dating seriously about 3 years after debuting. During their rookie years it's usually just casual dating. This is very common for younger idols.  Usually, male idols would date non-celebs. It's easier for them to maintain and it also gives them a more normal dating feeling. Like seriously, fans should just accept that their bias is also just a human being who have feelings. The person you see on-stage or on-screen is most likely just 20% of who your bias really is. 80% of who you see is the character their agency wants them to be. ",

Namjoon  I think namjoon may be in a serious relationship maybe they aren\u2019t idols..I haven\u2019t seen any idol wearing any specific ring for a while..and most likely has a family but I doubt it considering it would be pretty hard to hide it.. Jungkook  Jungkook may be dating someone as well..idk it\u2019s just my gut feeling lol..but most likely won\u2019t say anything soon considering you guys build up this whole drama of him possibly dating\u2026.and you guys attack him (or the person he is rumored to be dating) which is wrong and unnecessary.. kai and Jennie  I feel like they may still be together but keeping it private..because of dispatch, it was wrong for them to leak their relationship which SHOULD HAVE BEEN kept private and she should have been able to tell us on her own time..I think the only reason the breakup happened is because it got leaked when it wasn\u2019t supposed to be.. Ros\u00e9  Another gut feeling! AND NO NOT LOREN. I\u2019m actually getting tired of that ship already but I think ros\u00e9 could possibly be dating someone no lie.. Almost every single exo member\ud83d\ude2d  So\u2026\u2026case closed theyre in a relationship \ud83d\ude2d lemme Stop..I think most of them are definitely in a relationship no doubt Tae Tae  Tae is probably in a relationship.. Taehyung & Jungkook  I\u2019m not gonna lie in past I was kinda rooting for it..their was a possibility but then again their members have been around each other for a while so they are pretty close and I understand that but a little bit of me was kind of hoping..and if they are just friends then they are I hope that stops y\u2019all from making those weird edits and fanfics..I\u2019m okay with shipping until you guys are forcing tae to even tell you to stop.. But Anyways that my thoughts/opinions and yeah..  ",
