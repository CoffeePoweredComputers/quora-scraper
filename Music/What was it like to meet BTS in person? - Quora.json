            "answer_text": "When I first met them in 2016, I hadn\u2019t come out as a trans boy yet. I was still known by everyone as a girl when in reality, I was a boy. Namjoon was the first member I met. He called me pretty and I interjected and said \u2018handsome\u2019. When he looked confused, I showed him a small note I wrote (in terrible Korean since I am still learning) explaining I was a transgender boy and used he/him/his pronouns. Namjoon quickly apologized, to which I said it was fine, and that no one knows yet but me and him. To my shock and worry, a few tears filled in his eyes because he felt so grateful he was the first person I came out to. I felt guilty and said \u201cdon\u2019t cry don\u2019t cry.\u201d He quickly smiled though when I gave him a giant Ryan plushy. Hobi was next. He had heard what I said to Namjoon, aka me being trans, and I gave him the same note as well as my preferred name. He said my name was very handsome and I clumsily bowed, almost hitting the table, and thanked him. I then complimented his dancing and that he was my bias wrecker (Seokjin\u2019s been my bias since I found them in 2013) and he was super happy to know this. I then met Taehyung who I then gave the same \u201ci\u2019m trans\u201d note too and was happy I came out to him. He then asked me when I became an army and I said \u201cJuly 2013\u201d to his amazement. I was a bit flustered during this interaction because he is SO HANDSOME up close. Jungkook was next. He was beyond excited when I gave him some food and complemented my hair (at the time I had dyed my hair purple.) He said \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d when I said I was trans. I asked him about Korean snacks he liked and then said his singing voice is very comforting. Yoongi was next and possibly, next to Namjoon, the most emotional. He smiled adorably when I came out to him. Things got sad, however, when I had moved my hoodie sleeves a bit because they were a bit big and my self-harm scars were showing. He saw them and frowned, his eyes a bit sad. He asked why I hurt myself and I said \u201cmy brain is sick.\u201d He patted my hand before asking me if he could write something on my wrist. I nodded, shocked since I had never seen an idol do this before, and I saw he drew a heart. I started crying because everyone else in my life whose seen my scars had looked at me with pity or told me something was wrong with me (telling this to someone with depression and anxiety isn\u2019t good.) I thanked him for the heart and promised I would work on getting better. It\u2019s 2020 now and I haven\u2019t cut in about three months. I broke my promise but I am trying to get better. Seokjin, worldwide handsome himself, was next. I was a bit flustered, similar to Tae, because of his visuals and ended up not talking too much. I did hand him my \u201ci\u2019m trans\u201d note thankfully and he smiled brightly. I told him he inspired me to start baking and told him I made my own bday cake, to his excitement. Last, but never least, Jimin. I was crying when I made eye-contact with him and he was super worried. I told him that he had inspired me to admit I had a eating disorder and to work on it. He smiled, a little sad, and was grateful I told him. When I mentioned being trans, he fist-bumped me (I don\u2019t like high-fives) and said I was \u201ca very cool and handsome boy.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Meeting bts was simultaneously the best and the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I met bts when they decided to \u201cjoin\u201d the annual cruise we go on with some friends from high school. I live in Finland, and on the second day of the trip, when the ship was leaving Stockholm, I noticed there were some new familiar faces walking the decks with us. So how was it? The minute I realised they were there I got super nervous. I felt sick. My heart was pounding. I was screaming inside. But, I realised that I have to keep it together for the sake of bts. That night, there were no idols on board, only normal tourists. So, meeting them was weirdly normal. We were standing in the same elevators and walking behind each other a lot, getting food side by side and so on. It wasn\u2019t until the night when we \u201cspent time together\u201d dancing at the club and chilling on the sofas (tae, jin, joon, hobi hmu we had fun). The only memeber I tried to have a conversation with was jimin, but me being my awkward self and him being shy it didn\u2019t last pretty long. He is the sweetest and very polite though. After those 30 hours breathing the same air we arrived in Helsinki. On my way home I realised that that was probably the only time I would ever see them in private. I started to regret a lot, about not just going to talk to them about music and life and more. That shitty feeling lasted for almost a year. Now I\u2019ve finally gotten over it and it\u2019s just a good memory. I\u2019m pretty sure if bts knew about the situation they would appreciate it. I mean, I waved at them a couple of times so if they noticed/cared they could\u2019ve figured out that I was a fan? The most important thing is that they had a great time and were comfortable the whole trip. You never know how they would react i they knew a fan slept literally a couple of corridors away. I think all fans should remember that idols are people too. If you meet them, please don\u2019t be creepy and follow them everywhere. Don\u2019t be a paparazzi. For everyone\u2019s sake: try to stay calm. You\u2019ll get so much more out of the experience with a nice chat and a smile on your face! It\u2019s hard but totally worth it! When I was watching bon voyage later and heard taehyung saying he enjoyed the cruise probably the most, i couldn\u2019t help but smile. Me too tae, me too. \u2022 Additional fangirl rant about their looks: They look so good. Wtf. Better than in pictures. But at the same time, they look weirdly different. Jungkook looked younger than usual and could\u2019ve easily been one of us. Seeing them irl may confuse you. It\u2019s like, as a fan you see those faces every day, but you haven\u2019t actually ever seen them. So when you do, it takes a moment to adjust. The first time I saw jin, before I realised that bts were there, he went past me so quickly I thought he was just some 16 year old #finnishboy. I even glared at him for he was running around almost crashing into people and I wasn\u2019t having it in my hangover. Oops. ",
