            "answer_text": "With a very good teacher. Young children can make decent progress on ten minutes\u2019 practice a day, provided they are being well taught. The older you are, the more time you need to practise - the brain and the muscle memory aren\u2019t as malleable as they are in young children so it takes longer to embed movements and gestures into the body\u2019s control mechanisms. If you\u2019re old enough to be asking this question, you\u2019re likely to need more practice than ten minutes. There aren\u2019t short-cuts to this. It takes time and it takes effort. If it didn\u2019t, the world would be full of absolutely brilliant players and \u2026 well, how many brilliant players do you number among your friends and acquaintances? I\u2019m sorry to sound chippy about this, but musicians\u2019 skills are really hard won over years of dedication and application. You wouldn\u2019t expect to become a successful athlete - even at a minor level - without a lot of training and sacrifice. Why would you expect to become a pianist in the same way? Different discipline, same effort. I would suggest that if you really want to learn to play the piano, you find yourself a good teacher and take that person\u2019s advice. Follow their instructions carefully and put the effort and the hours (yes, hours) in. It\u2019s true you can start a little at a time but to reach any level of competence, there is no substitute for practice. And practice takes time. A lot of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, you would have to make every minute count, but it is not impossible. Depends a lot on what your goals are; learning the piano is a neverending process of improvement. The virtue of piano is that you can hammer out a decent sound with astoundingly little practice (as compared to for example violin). So if you don\u2019t have high expectations, you can meet them on 10 mins a day of practicing. This would however not be enough to keep up in any kind of school - they would expect you to improve faster than is possible on 10 mins a day. But if you are an adult beginner taking up piano as a hobby, feel free and move at your own pace. If I was restricted to 10 minutes a day, I would just do scales for first few weeks and then add simple arrangements of pop songs that I like - they should be easy enough to do and playing something you like is rewarding and motivating. Don\u2019t push yoursef into complicated techical exercises or intermediate/advanced arrangements. Easy does it. ",
