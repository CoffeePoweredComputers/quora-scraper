            "answer_text": "Sweden, in my opinion, does well because of a handful of reasons: Success begets success: Certainly at the moment (Sweden being by far the most successful country of this century), Swedish entries are part of a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d of sorts. Because we expect Sweden to enter good songs, even a slightly uninspired one sounds better than it would from a country which typically enters rubbish, so we\u2019re more likely to vote for it.Swedes have a near-native command of English: Obviously most countries when they choose a song in English tend to do their best to send a singer who doesn\u2019t sing with a strong accent, but the Swedes have a veritable stable of these just ready to go. The slightly clunky lyrics of a song like Undo (\u201cUndo my sad/Undo what hurts so bad\u201d) are such a notable exception that people still think of them four years later.Melodifestivalen is a gruelling competition: In pretty much any terms you\u2019d care to name (size of field, standard of entries, size of audience, international interest), the Swedish national final is the biggest one going. If you can win Melodifestivalen, you\u2019ve already been through a Eurovision-like process, and are ready to try your hand at the real thing. Remember, too, that Swedish entrants like Sanna Nielsen and M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w had been frequent Melodifestivalen entrants before finally getting their chance at Eurovision.Melodifestivalen attracts the best: A lot of countries treat their national finals as a \u201cdevelopment\u201d ground for newer artists, or a chance to resurrect some older careers. Even just changing the selection methodology from year to year can result in a drop in quality. Meanwhile, Melodifestivalen consistently attracts the top songwriters, best composers and leading singers. If you\u2019re consistently entering the best performers, that\u2019s got to translate to success.Sweden cares about Eurovision: Compare Sweden\u2019s success with the UK\u2019s lack thereof. The UK, as suggested above, has never really worked out what it wants to do with its entries (enter superannuated performers like Blue, Scootch, Bonnie Tyler and Englebert Humperdinck, or enter newer acts?). As a result, the UK\u2019s entry is usually forgettable. Sweden, on the other hand, wants to win and plays to do so.Sweden plays it safe: While the exact style and substance of the Swedish entry varies from year to year (Charlotte Nilsson with something a bit dansband-ish, Loreen with a club anthem, M\u00e5ns with a massive summer hit, and that\u2019s just recent winners), we know a lot of what the Swedes will give us next year already. It\u2019s going to be a big pop song with a strong hook, most likely backed up by some pretty strong choreography and/or special effects. It won\u2019t sound entirely \u201cof the moment\u201d, but it won\u2019t be a million years out of date either. This is in stark contrast to a great many other countries, who could enter anything from heavy metal to classical-crossover. It might sound like a negative that Sweden is predictable, but it\u2019s really not - all those other songs can work (in which case you get someone else winning) or not (in which case people vote for what sounds pleasantly familiar and we go back to Stockholm, G\u00f6teborg, Malm\u00f6 or somewhere nearby).",

            "answer_text": "If I can remember (I am an Indian living in India, so don't blame me for lack of knowledge) Sweden has won ESC twice (first in 1999 when Charlotte Perrelli won with her song Take Me To Your Heaven & in 2012 when Loreen won with her song Euphoria) & came 3rd twice (in 2011 with Eric Saade's Popular & 2014 with Sanna's Undo). I don't know much about their other notable positions. Don't know if it fits in category of doing well (mind you, I don't have much knowledge of other countries' positions) but yes, their music always stands out. I am a keen follower of Swedish music (read my bio!) & I listen to them a lot. Around 75% of my songs in phone are by Swedish artists. Reason for doing so well (if its so, don't get me wrong!) is that they always believe in melody. There's hardly any bland composition. They also focus a lot on production. And we almost always have immensely talented song-writers like Fredrik Kempe (has won it 4 times +1 for Norway) / Thomas G'son (Euphoria) / Peter Bostrom / Tony Nilsson (both great producers) participating there in Melodifestivalen. So, there's always a tough competition going on and the best makes it. May be this is the only reason. ",
