            "answer_text": "First, do you mean \u201cpitch\u201d or \u201ctimbre\u201d? If you mean that you prefer the clarinet's higher register, where it plays notes in the same range as the soprano saxophone, oboe, or flute, that's pitch. You make it sound that high when you play anything \u201cover the break.\u201d Since about half of the instrument's range lies over the break, you'll be playing up there a lot \u2014 but probably not until your second or third year. The E flat soprano clarinet plays that high pretty much all the time, but it is very rarely used and appears almost exclusively in orchestras. If you mean that you like the clarinet to sound sort of nasally or reedy like it is a saxophone no matter how high or low the note is, that's timbre (pronounced TAWM-burr). You can make a clarinet sound more nasally or reedy by using a softer reed, but beware: your teachers will all try to get you to stop, because that isn't \u201cgood characteristic tone\u201d for a clarinet. It will also prevent you from developing the muscles required to play clarinet well. About the only place you can get away with using a too-soft reed consistently is in pep band, where the acoustics are terrible and everyone is playing loudly all the time. If you like the high notes, be patient and practice, and you'll get there. If you like the reedy/nasally sound, switch to saxophone. ",
