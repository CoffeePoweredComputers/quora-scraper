            "answer_text": "Well, I don\u2019t know anyone without teeth playing NAF, but I believe yes, you can. The only requirement is that you can form a tight seal between your lips and flute\u2019s mouthpiece. Then you blow the air into the mouthpiece and you\u2019re done. There\u2019s no need to shape your lips in any complex way or utilize teeth or jaw movement in any way. ",
