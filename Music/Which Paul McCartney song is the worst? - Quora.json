It\u2019s dissonant and scratchy sounding, with no real melody, just a climb down the scale with ugly guitar scratches or something that sounds like steel wires being scraped on a blackboard. Paul\u2019s voices are very shrill as well. In other words, there\u2019s no sensual pleasure from this bit of noise for me. ",
