Just that, if you see me somewhere, whichever mood I am in and if I am humming a song, it has to be of Linkin park. Btw, the picture above is actually my phone wallpaper!! ",

            "answer_text": "I have been an ardent listener of Linkin Park since I was 13. This band literally intoduced me to the rock music. Before Linkin Park, I really had no idea what a rock band was. The first song I listened to was \u201cNumb\u201d and I was immediately mesmerized by Chester's voice. I remember listening to that song throughout the day without getting bored and the very same day I bought Hybrid Theory, Meteora and Minutes To Midnight from the music store. Minutes To Midnight was released that same year. Chester's voice was LP's greatest asset and I miss him terribly but he is a legend and legends never die. ",
