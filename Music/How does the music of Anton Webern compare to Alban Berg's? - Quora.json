            "answer_text": "Berg and Webern were both students of Arnold Schoenberg, but their music is more different from each other\u2019s than either\u2019s is from the Master. Berg was the most Romantic of the three. For whatever reason, it\u2019s hardest to tell the difference between his late-Romantic works, freely atonal works, and twelve-tone works. He seems to have been going for the same thing his whole life. When I listen to Wozzeck, I hear Romanticism taken to its ultimate extreme. Almost every scene has a moment in it when the music comes to an overpowering climax with the full orchestra playing very loudly. Those moments are never repeated exactly. Berg is traditionally considered the most approachable member of the Second Viennese School. That\u2019s probably not wrong; his music is the most tonal of the three\u2019s, even if it never settles on a home key. Berg is also notable for his use of leitmotif and repetition. Who could ever forget the \u201cWozzeck motif\u201d? This allowed him to write much longer works than the ones Schoenberg and Webern were writing at the time. Webern was a very strange and interesting composer, more \u201cethereal\u201d than any western classical composer before him. His early atonal works often have no repetition. They don\u2019t sound like random notes, though; each note is carefully and slowly released, with minute attention to tone color and dynamics. His early pieces are strange things rustling in the night. Once he began using Schoenberg\u2019s twelve-tone method, his music became somewhat more understandable. There were longer durations and graspable repetitions. His Symphony, Op. 21, is lovely and chiming, full of space and light. Webern put a lot of effort into his tone rows, using internal symmetry to unify his pieces. Webern\u2019s music seems less about expressing emotion than Berg\u2019s or Schoenberg\u2019s. Rather, it just exists, almost too fragile and delicate for this world. ",
