Cassette copies (copy) exist and artwork for the album but it was never officially released. AC/DC have never released an official greatest hits collection in any format. The soundtrack to Iron Man 2 featured some greatest hits and other lesser known tracks as did the 1986 soundtrack to the Stephen King Movie Who Made Who but that seems to be as near as it\u2019s got.
