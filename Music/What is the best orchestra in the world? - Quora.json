            "answer_text": "As usual, you have to ask\u2026 best for what? Each orchestra is somewhat specialised in its repertoire; they more or less all play the core repertoire, but then have their own take on what else is important. So for example, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra are the undoubted experts on Samuel Barber, Sibelius and New Zealand\u2019s own Douglas Lilburn. In fact, I\u2019ve never heard an orchestra from outside NZ get Lilburn right at all, although the Helsinki orchestra got close\u2026 it helps to have the right kind of concert hall to play it in. The NZSO with Hilary Hahn were absolutely spinechilling playing the Sibelius Violin Concerto, I can\u2019t imagine a better performance. Different, maybe, but not better. Whereas, the Berlin Philharmonic are the Beethoven orchestra, and the Academy of Ancient Music in London are the Bach orchestra. I once heard the Boston Symphony give an astounding Shostakovich 5. And so on. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, it\u2019s impossible to see past British cats. It staggers me off the scale just to think at how much our country has got it together in this field.  If you take just London, you have the LSO, London/Royal Philharmonics, the Philharmonia, the BBC Symphony/Concert Orchestras, English Chamber Orchestra\u2026and that\u2019s before you get outside!  Then you get the Bournemouth Symphony, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle Orchestra, the BBC Philharmonic, City of Birmingham Symphony, BBC National Orchestra of Wales\u2026  Each and every one of them has performed brilliantly across a wide range of repertoire beyond the classics, such as film scores, live special concerts, etc. \u2013 the sort of stuff that many other orchestras would frown upon playing.  So, again, the best orchestra is any decent British orchestra, for they totally rock! ",
