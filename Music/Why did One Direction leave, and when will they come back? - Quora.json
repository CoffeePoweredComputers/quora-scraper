            "answer_text": "There was no announcement that One Direction left or disbanded last 2015. Their announcement was they are going on hiatus for 18 months and it was said because their contract. After 2015, basically a lot of things happened. When the boys started to became solo artists, everyone was already saying that One Direction has finally broken up. They were pretty silent about the whole One Direction hiatus and only Liam keeps lying about them coming back on this month or this year. Finally, 2020 came when Liam announced that they will be coming back. Niall confirmed it himself on Carpool Karaoke. Things are pretty messy right now. Basically a lot of rumors are going around that they will leave SYCO, because of them not addressing anything about the management and also just focusing on each other during their 10th Anniversary. Also, it was said that Zayn's departure was a stunt. I don't really know what for but the whole thing was actually staged. Louis and Zayn was said to be against each other after his departure but it was revealed to be staged by SYCO. Every. Thing. Zayn. Did. About. Hating. On. One. Direction. Is. Staged. Let me be clear that these are rumors circulating in the internet but there are plenty of proofs that it could be true. To answer your second question, they are coming back. One Direction's Social Media accounts are active daily. Here is my theory on what's going to happen: This will probably their last or 2nd to the last activity as a group. They'll probably release another album in the future but that could be the last one. They will leave their management and of course, won't be One Direction anymore, they have to change their name for legal reasons. Regardless of what could happen to them as a band, they are still going to be a happy and strong group of friends until the end. Legends  ",
