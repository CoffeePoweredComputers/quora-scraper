Tomorrow is the day that brings new opportunities, new hopes in those people's lives. They spend their entire lifetime waiting for that \u201ctomorrow\u201d, that usually never came. This song asks those people with dreams to never stop dreaming and waiting for that day they would be able to do the things they find solace in. No matter how long it takes,no matter how much you've worn out in this long run, just don't give up on that \u201ctomorrow\u201d. It will come to you. ",
