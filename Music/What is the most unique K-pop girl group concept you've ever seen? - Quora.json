            "answer_text": "Oooooooh boy. Over the years, there have been many. Honestly, sometimes I forget how strange Kpop can get, and how unexpected some of the hits are. Here are some of the more *unique* ones off the top of my head:  T-ARA - Bo Peep Bo Peep, \ud2f0\uc544\ub77c - \ubcf4\ud54d\ubcf4\ud54d, Music Core 20091219 Bo peep Bo Peep - T-AraI have no idea what was happening for this one. The girls wore little tails, animal headbands, and paws for the performances, and the concept was definitely cutesy. The song itself was about a clingy girlfriend trying to get her boyfriend to like her again, and (I guess??) convince him how cute she was. However strange, this is the song that made them popular, and paved the way for their later (much, much better) tracks. [Comeback Stage] ORANGE CARAMEL - Catallena, \uc624\ub80c\uc9c0\uceac\ub77c\uba5c - \uae4c\ud0c8\ub808\ub098, Show Music core 20140315 Catallena - Orange CaramelAgain, I don\u2019t know what was happening here. The group itself was a subunit of After School, which had a much sexier vibe and concept. This subunit was supposed to show a cuter, more fun and upbeat side of the members. All of their concepts were off the wall, and the costuming and live stages played that up. However, this song was (again) a massive hit in Korea and they rode the wave of its popularity for a long time. All of the outfits were themed around food. They yelped at the beginning. Also\u2026 lowkey, it\u2019s a major bop. Plus, the members of Orange Caramel genuinely enjoyed doing these kinds of fun, quirky performances (it was probably a nice break from the overt sexiness in After School.) Crayon Pop - Bar Bar Bar, \ud06c\ub808\uc6a9\ud31d - \ube60\ube60\ube60, Show Champion 20130724 Bar Bar Bar - Crayon PopThe entire song is about\u2026 jumping. I looked up the lyrics, both Korean and English, and that\u2019s it. Just some friendly neighborhood Kpop idols encouraging everyone (even mamas and papas) to get up, follow them, and jump. The dance is strangely mesmerizing, the costumes are simple and bizarre, and somehow\u2026 this was also a major hit in Korea. Amazing. [HOT] AOA - Like a Cat, \uc5d0\uc774\uc624\uc5d0\uc774 - \uc0ac\ubfd0\uc0ac\ubfd0, Show Music core 20141206 Like A Cat - AOAThe title pretty much sums up the song. Basically, you\u2019ve got some sexy ladies who are trying to show off how cool and cat-like they are. Some of the members wore cat-ear headbands, and the choreo was distinctly feline. Not the weirdest, but they definitely took the concept literally. \ud551\ud06c\ud310\ud0c0\uc9c0 Pink Fantasy '\uc774\ub9ac\uc640' KPOP TV Show M COUNTDOWN Iriwa - Pink FantasySo onto a modern group that hasn\u2019t been too successful yet. The song itself is typical Kpop, as it\u2019s all about getting a boy to like/follow you. The weird twist is that this group has a hidden member (named Daewang) who appears in their performances and MVs while wearing a huge bunny mask. Apparently they\u2019ll reveal this member (my theory is they\u2019re actually a boy, but who knows) once they get their first music show win. I don\u2019t know how long that might take, but I\u2019m intrigued to know how it\u2019ll turn out. [LOONA - INTRO + So What] Comeback Stage | M COUNTDOWN 200206 EP.651 LOONAThis final group is unusual in a good way (and yes, this is a shameless plug for my favorite girl group.) What makes them unique is how the group was formed: their Korean name, \uc774\ub2ec\uc758 \uc18c\ub140, means \u201cgirl of the month,\u201d so each member was introduced individually, with their own solo track and MV, and represented a month. Some were also put in subunits, which had their own tracks and mini-albums. All together, the group took almost two years to debut fully, but it gave the fans a chance to get to know each member. The solo tracks are all amazing, and the level of detail put into their concept is insane. There are a lot of theories about the extended universe as well.Anyways, stream \u2018So What,\u2019 and stan LOONA for clear skin!!That\u2019s all for now. There are a ton more unusual concepts and girl groups out there, so if I think of any more I\u2019ll add them later. I hope you enjoyed, and cheers~!

            "answer_text": "I think *the* most unique group concept I\u2019ve seen is\u2026 AOA. In the beginning, AOA debuted as a group of angels known as Seolhyunari, Choaya, Hyejeong.Linus, Chanmi T.T, Yunaria, Minaring, Jiminel\u2026 and a half-angel, Y. They were meant to be composed of seven members who would dance and sing and one girl who only participated in AOA Black\u2019s band-concept promotions as their drummer. Thus, they were known as a 7+1 group. Youkyung literally never sang. She never danced. She did appear in three or four music videos, but her role was *only* as a drummer. Have you ever met another kpop girl group member who didn\u2019t sing, didn\u2019t dance, didn\u2019t rap, wasn\u2019t injured, and just drummed? Didn\u2019t think so. ",
