            "answer_text": "the root \u05d6\u05e0\u05d4 appears 93 times in the bible. It means to astray\u2026 when it comes to a woman, it means she betrays her husband or that she is a whore\u2026But it might refer to the whole nation, or to a man too\u2026In many cases it is just a whore (\u05d6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4). for example see in Leviticus Chapter 17 7 And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs, after whom they go astray (\u05d6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd). This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. About Judges Chapter 19, I think the meaning is that she just left her husband and returned back to her father. That is why the husband could take her back, and her father was happy about his coming\u2026But it might be that her behavior was not moral, but it is not clear.. 2 And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth-lehem in Judah, and was there the space of four months. The Talmud in Gitin analyses that case. The Talmud explain like I did. It explains that she leaved him because he was angry at her, for some reason\u2026(not because of betraying \u2026). Other ancient Rabbis explain differently\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The Hebrew word of which your question asked, is not a word with only one meaning. The word can be used in reference to 'one who adulterated', sex trafficking, sex trade working, unfaithful spouse, BUT is also used metaphorically (for example: \u201cshe whored her wardrobe\u201d or \u201cdads car is pumping!\u201d. The latter is more on target with the usage in the verse of which you asked. As always, context is everything. Read at least the10 verses which surround a verse in question.
