            "answer_text": "The future won't be affected anything. It is the same as what people think now about future with google. It is more relevant when we think if some visionary guy or women dies, who will be the person able to match him or her and bring about the change and help the world. As soon as google dies, there will be next company i.e bing offered by MSFT which will be surged with such huge amounts of traffic that it will crash and people will wish google didn't die. There will be hashtag #google on twitter trending almost everyday like #pokemonGo. The direct google competitors who will see good amount of traffic since google is only software and some hardware. There will be war between thousands of people trying to use the huge forgotten, not yet completely abandoned parts of software and people working there and coders, hackers, enthusiasts would replicate the google and there will thousands of videos and sites explaining on \u201chow to access google search\u201d. There will be another company, another form of company in some time which will be better and faster compared google. This is true if you study the internet wars, how companies like MSFT owned the internet with IE, how youtube owned the videos and google bought it and owned the competition and other thousands of examples. The most affected software would not be search it would be maps. As there are people increasingly using apps to search for things like for restaurants, ride sharing etc. Google maps is the leader, next best is apple maps but available only on ios. Still there are many other mapping companies but google\u2019s offering is best almost everywhere in whole world. There will be huge loss to openness of everything, google mail, maps, docs, hangout and others. The biggest blow would be to the ad companies which are in hundreds of thousands in each country and literally millions of people jobs depending on it. Thinking of google to be dead is not a bad thing since it won't happen overnight. It will happen slowly, it will takes years. During this transition every other company would have offered much better than google(since that is the reason why they would die). You can compare it to Motorola and the most famous and recent Nokia which among many. ",

            "answer_text": "If Google dies, Apple will hold a party and Tesla will celebrate with Apple.  Apple\u2019s only competition in the US is Google. iOS and Android are the only two major OSes. If Google dies, Apple will rule supreme because they will have a monopoly over smart phones because people will have to switch to them. Google and Apple are constantly butting heads in research and Apple will have less pressure. Samsung will get scared and try and fail to create their own OS. Tesla will celebrate Besides from Tesla making self driving cars, the only other company close is Google. Tesla will have a monopoly in the self driving car market until Apple releases theirs. This being said, a world without Google would be horrible. Information would be harder due to the amount of the world reliant on Google. 90% of people use Google in the world.  At 404 upvotes (I hope people know why 404 is important), I adding one more company that will be happy. Yahoo will be extremely happy. They will regain the search engine competition and it will help Apple because Yahoo and Apple would be very happy. Google would have a huge impact on the future. And if this answer is collapsed, there will be an error 404. Lol ",
