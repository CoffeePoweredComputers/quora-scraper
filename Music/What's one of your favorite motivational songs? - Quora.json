Cheesy and cliche, I know\u2026but, \u201cEye of The Tiger\u201d by Survivor gets me pumped. Motivates my confidence.\u201cThe Greatest\u201d by Sia. Makes me literally feel like I can do anything. Gives me the energy I need when I\u2019m in a \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d mood. Motivates my courage and energy.\u201cHappy\u201d by Pharrell Williams. I mean, how could this song not make you just want to dance? This song can change my mood instantly. It motivates my happiness.\u201cAlive\u201d by Sia (also makes me cry, but pushes me forward. Pulls on the heart strings). Sia reminds me of where I\u2019ve been and how I\u2019ve made it and to take advantage of the fact that I am alive. It motivates my existence.\u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believing\u201d by Journey (again, cliche, I know). It motivates my faith that things will work out for the best.A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s album \u201cMidnight Marauders.\u201d In fact, any 90\u2019s rap will pump me up and get me in the mood to fuck shit up (in a good way). Not sure it really motivates me per se, but I can\u2019t sit still during this album.If I\u2019m feeling something heavy in my heart, I\u2019ll put on any \u201cTribe Called Red\u201d song or any \u201cWardruna\u201d song (seriously watch this performance). I could just lay there and let the music take over. It motivates my healing.Any Michael Jackson song. Michael makes me so happy. Also can\u2019t sit still with his music.Depeche Mode gets me feeling myself. Mmmmm\u2026Banks. Omigod Banks. She gets me feeling myself too and whenever I listen to her, I almost feel this sexy, angsty, \u201cI\u2019m gunna prove that I can make it without you because I am enough\u201d sorta attitude. She reminds me of my strength and inner-goddess. She motivates my self-love.I\u2019m going to break another rule here and add an \u201cEleventh Song.\u201d But I couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cEdge of Seventeen\u201d by Stevie Nicks. Need I explain with this one? Stevie is a legend.",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: Some songs motivate some people that would NEVER motivate other people. Also some songs motivate me to fight while others motivate me to sing, run, or make art. With that established ill tell you some of my top 5 favorite motivational songs (in no particular order) and what they motivate me to do: \u201cMove Along\u201d by the All American Rejects This song gets me all kinds of pumped up. It makes me want to throw off any hindrances I have and run forward with Reckless Abandon. Typically I live my life already with a lot of RA, so the underlying motivational theme to this song is to never give up on getting out of Oklahoma and making a name for myself. The All American Rejects, like myself, are from Oklahoma and this song of perseverance is their biggest hit to date, it helped them make a name for themselves. How could I listen to it and not think of doing the same? 2. \u201cAll I want\u201d by A Day to Remember  \u201cAll I want is a place to call my own, to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone whoa oh, you know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low\u201d Just those words should be motivational enough. A singular focus on becoming who you really are so that you can help others do the same. My tentative career choice right now is a detective and boy does this song speak to pursing that. this song motivates me to seek out and find exactly what I want to do, to find out who I am, so that I can turn around and save lives. There is a catch though, in order to get that point you have to do two things. As Jeremy McKinnon and crew so masterfully state, you gotta keep your hopes up high and your head down low. 3. \u201cTill I collapse\u201d by Eminem  I\u2019m a sucker for the aggressive rhyme spitter from Detroit. Eminem has a way of making his aggressiveness seep over into the people that listen to his music and i\u2019m no exception. I grew up never listening to any rap that was christian based and my family frowned upon me listening to secular rap due to its explicit nature, but as is my personality I never write off anything and i\u2019m curious about everything. I didn't know where to start when I set out to educate myself concerning secular rap, so I asked myself and others who is considered the best. Em was the one I got and I listened to all his stuff, but this song was the one I was most drawn to. This song said to me that mom and dad were wrong, rap can be more than sex, drugs, money, it can also be incredibly honest and very motivating. This song makes feel invincible and it also motivates me to find my own way in the world. 4. \u201cRivers and Roads\u201d by The Head and The Heart  I came to know of this band and this song while trying to coax the girl I liked at the time to give me a song to learn on guitar to play for her. She kind of was reluctant to give me one at first, but eventually she said she really liked this one. I learned it back, forth, up, down, left, and right. Headstrong I was. I haven't spoken to that girl in like two years and though she faded this song didn't. This song that is forever ingrained in my head is a reminder/motivator to never give up on love and that heart break can be a motivator instead of a hindrance. The lyrics follow that pattern talking about how even as friends and family come and go the one thing that remains is the places you've been and the places you will go. \u201cRivers and roads, rivers and roads, rivers till I reach you.\u201d 5. \u201cHappiness\u201d by NEEDTOBREATHE  My final motivating song is happiness. Do not be fooled, this is not a song about a happy person, but rather about a person who is haunted by the pursuit of it. \u201cI've got dreams that keep me up in the dead of night, telling me I wasn't made for the simple life\u201d. I cant scratch the surface of how accurate that is in my own life. Often in the middle of the night I wake up and just wanna run like Bo Rinehart is doing in this video. I often feel like I can do anything. Like seriously I think with enough hard work I can do anything, but the issue in life is not about what you can do, what makes you happy, or how to obtain that happiness, but rather what is your purpose. If you have none you will remain void of joy and you will live a life in eternal search for what pleases you. I often forget this, but this song reminds me. It motivates me to seek joy not happiness.
