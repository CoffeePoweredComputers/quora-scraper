            "answer_text": "You can sometimes sample classical music for free (legally speaking), but not usually. While the compositions / musical scores themselves (up to the 1920s or so) are generally in the public domain, the recordings of the music are usually not. The recordings are generally under copyright protection. There are some public domain recordings of classical music, though; you can find many older recordings for download at the International Music Score Library Project Free Sheet Music PDF Download. There is something called a \u2018fair use\u2019 doctrine, in which a person could sample up to 30 seconds or so of a piece of copyrighted music without penalty. However, the legal issues there are fairly complicated. I believe that the \u2018fair use' rules are intended to allow reviewers a chance to include small pieces of the material they're reviewing inside their review. I don't think they would extend to someone who is hoping to sample a piece of music for their own song, particularly if the song they're making is released with the goal of earning money. It would be better to use public domain recordings only --- that way, there's no gray area! ",
