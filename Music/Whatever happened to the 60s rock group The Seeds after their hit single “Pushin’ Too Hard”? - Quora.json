            "answer_text": "The Seeds continued to record after \u201cPushin\u2019 Too Hard\u201d made the United States Top Forty in 1966. Of their later singles, only a re-release of \u201cCan\u2019t Seem to Make You Mine\u201d in 1967 came anywhere near the Top Forty. They made appearances on the television show \u2018The Mothers-in-Law\u2019 and the 1968 film \u2018The Psych-Out.\u2019 In 1967, they recorded a blues album under the name \u2018A Full Spoon of Seedy Blues.\u2019 In 1968, the band changed its name to Sky Saxon and the Seeds. The band continued to exist until 1972. Lead singer Sky Saxon was involved in Ya How Wha, a religious organization that also released music, and was involved in the Ya How Wha-related album \u2018Golden Sunrise.\u2019 Saxon also recorded solo albums. By the Nineteen-Eighties, Generation Jones and Generation X musicians were citing the Seeds as a major influence, and inviting Saxon to collaborate on their albums. Sky Saxon resurrected the Seeds to perform on the Summer of Love tour in 1989, but disbanded them again after the tour finished. In 2003, Saxon resurrected the Seeds again, and various versions toured until Saxon\u2019s death in 2009. In 2014, the band was the subject of the documentary \u2018The Seeds: Pushin\u2019 Too Hard.\u2019 In 2017, founding member Daryl Hooper founded a new version of the band to tour the heritage rock and roll circuit.

Lead singer Sky Saxon kept the band name going until 1972, after which they officially broke up (though the resourceful Mr Saxon would continue to release solo material under variants of the Seeds name until well into the 1980s). They were briefly revived in 1989 for a successful tour alongside other sixties hit acts (Big Brother and the Holding Company, Love, The Music Machine & Strawberry Alarm Clock) and once more in 2003, with Saxon joined by original guitarist Jan Savage and a number of new members. They would continue to work the heritage circuit until Saxon\u2019s death in 2009 at the age of 71. A further incarnation of the band featuring Savage and fellow founder member Darryl Hooper (keyboards) reformed in 2017 and are still touring to this day. Many of their songs meanwhile have been covered by bands/artists as diverse as Garbage, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Electric Prunes, Yo La Tengo, Iggy Pop and The Bangles. The Seeds - Wikipedia ",
