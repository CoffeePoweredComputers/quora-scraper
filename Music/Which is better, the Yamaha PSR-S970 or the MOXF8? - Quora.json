            "answer_text": "First of all, you should understand the basic difference between both the instruments. Yamaha PSR S970 is an arranger workstation. The PSR-S970 is the flagship model of the S-series, and combines all the functionality of the other models in the range together with powerful performance features including versatile effects inherited from the legendary Tyros 5, external display capability and a programmable vocal harmony function. An arranger keyboard has built-in \u201cauto-accompaniment.\u201d In other words, with the push of just a few buttons, the keyboard will provide backing tracks that automatically match the style, rhythm, and tempo of what you're playing. Yamaha MOXF8 is a synthesizer keyboard. The Yamaha MOTIF is among the most respected keyboards of the current century. Through its many reincarnations, it has always been among the most revered instruments in professional stage and studio keyboard performance. The Yamaha MOXF8 is the latest iteration of this noble tradition, and stands again as a model of sonic excellence and technical functionality. The MOXF8 series combines a MOTIF XF sound engine and Flash memory expandability, a MIDI keyboard controller with extensive DAW and VST control, USB Audio/MIDI interfacing, onboard sequencing, and an extensive DAW / VST software bundle. A synthesizer keyboard produce sounds from waveforms. You can play the various sounds present in your synth and at the same time you can enhance it and add various elements to it using various envelopes and filters according to your taste/requirements. It doesn't have an auto built-in \u201cauto-accompaniment\u201d function. Hope it helps.
