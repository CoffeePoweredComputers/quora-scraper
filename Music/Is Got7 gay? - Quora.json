            "answer_text": "I think they\u2019re all straight except for Bambam. Now, at first, I thought Bambam was straight. I didn\u2019t want to generalize him simple because he has feminine mannerisms. I also assumed that he just liked skinship and he had to act like that towards the members for his job. While I do believe that kpop companies make these idols do fanservice, I do believe that Bambam is gay because now I noticed that he doesn\u2019t seem into women and there\u2019s this video of him dancing during a concert where he\u2019s literally putting his hand to his mouth imitating giving a blowjob. That\u2019s just not something straight men do. Here\u2019s the link to the video (go to 0:20) to find the video of Bambam:  There is no heterosexual explanation for that. And no, I don\u2019t believe JYP told Bambam to do this. Two of the other members are sitting to the right of Bambam. One of them is JB but I can\u2019t tell who the other one is cause the vid is blurry. The other member laughs after Bambam imitates giving a blowjob while JB at first looks surprised and then laughs.

            "answer_text": "Obviously, we shouldn\u2019t make assumptions about one\u2019s sexuality, but I\u2019m going to do it anyways. In all honesty, I don\u2019t think any of them are gay. For the most part, they all show pretty masculine qualities, except maybe BamBam. There has been dating rumors for BamBam though (like with Mina) and he shows a lot of cringy male-style moments, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s straight. But often the way he acts and is a fashionista might imply that he\u2019s bisexual, but we don\u2019t know. Also to note, I believe BamBam is the only member who doesn\u2019t actually work out (to gain muscles) which is kind of a masculine type of desire. ",
