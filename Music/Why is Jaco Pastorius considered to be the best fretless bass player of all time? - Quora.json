            "answer_text": "Because he basically invented the modern fretless bass paradigm. There is fretless bass before Jaco, then fretless bass after Jaco. You have to think back to the era - what he did in 1976 on his first solo record had never been done before. Every fretless player that has followed him can\u2019t help but have been influenced, either directly or indirectly, by Jaco. Anytime you hear a fretless bass played melodically, with that \u2018mwah\u2019 sound, you\u2019re hearing Jaco\u2019s legacy. Fretless electric basses have been available more or less since the birth of the instrument, but the people who used them back in the early days generally stuck foam mutes on them in order to make them sound more like upright basses. Not Jaco. He pulled the frets out of his Jazz Bass, epoxied the fingerboard with boat epoxy to make it harder and smoother, and made the most of this new sound the bass now had - the fretless sound that everyone ever since has wanted to emulate. That growly, lyrical \u2018mwahhh\u2019, that sounds like equal doses of euphonium and cello. Not only did he have this new sound to play with, he backed it up with a musical lexicon that spanned ages and genres. He used to say that, in addition to all the jazz greats he studied, he grew up on pop and soul music and owes his musical voice just as much to Frank Sinatra, James Brown and The Beatles as to Charlie Parker and Mingus. Combine all that with his spectacular showmanship - crazy clothes, dancing, backflips, fire, extended solos and so on - and you have the makings of a legend. His legendary status was cut tragically short by the ravages of mental illness, which eventually led to his death at the hands of a Florida nightclub bouncer. ",

            "answer_text": "He's considered the best because he was an innovator. He brought the electric bass from the back of the band to the front. If it wasn't for him a lot of bass players wouldn't play the way they do now. And he was so precise and flawless in his playing. And he was a great soloist. No one was soloing as he did, at the time. Him being the first to do many on the electric bass; things like doing a full song with only harmonics (portrait of tracy). What other bass player you know meshed perfectly with the styles of Herbie Hancock and Pat Matheny? ",
