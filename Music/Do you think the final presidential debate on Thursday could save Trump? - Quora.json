            "answer_text": "Hunter was the middle man taking millions in bribes in China, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Romania, so far. He used VP Joe Biden\u2019s influence to make illegal deals, and then was forced to give his dad a cut of the money. Or in other words, Joe Biden as the Vice President of the United States used his family members to funnel money into their bank accounts, at the cost of the security of US foreign policy. Joe Biden is now ineligible to be president, because he is vulnerable to international blackmail and extortion. We have pictures and videos of Hunter Biden, engaged in drug use and prostitution. We have financial documents, text messages, and verified emails from his business partner, who is already in Federal jail on corruption charges. The media knows this is all true, and continues to censor people and cover up the story, and refuse to report it. The entire Democrat party is corrupt, and Pelosi and Romney\u2019s kids are also involved in Ukraine energy company. They knew the Russia collusion and Russia dossier was faked, but they pushed that lie to the American people for 3.5 years, and then they tried to impeach Trump for asking about the Ukraine corruption which Joe Biden actually admitted extorting the Ukrainian prosecutor to on tape, bragging about it. It\u2019s all going to come out. Upvote if you want the truth to come out. The hard drives became the legal property of the computer store after Hunter refused to pick them up or pay for them after months of phone calls. The computer store owner offered the hard drives to the FBI and was turned down TWICE. The third time they finally took them, but not before the owner copied the drives and gave them to Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of NYC and former federal prosecutor who helped take down several NY mafia families. Rudy then gave the data to a few select news outlets. Rudy recently met with the Delaware state police and gave them the hard drives. Nothing can stop the truth from coming out. ",

There were some news reports yesterday that so many people have already voted. There aren\u2019t as many undecided voters for Trump to convince. The window is closing for him. I\u2019m also not sure if the debate will happen. Trumps campaign is already complaining about the debate topics and the moderator. ",
