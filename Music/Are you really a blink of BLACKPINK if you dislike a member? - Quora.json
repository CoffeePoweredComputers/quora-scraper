For comparison, ask if you're a Blink if you have a bias. No one has an issue with biases yet most people with s bias acknowledge there's a trait that they dislike of other members or traits that cause them to not Stan them as much as their bias. So yeah, you're a fan even if you don't like a member. You're not a fan if you bash that member ",
