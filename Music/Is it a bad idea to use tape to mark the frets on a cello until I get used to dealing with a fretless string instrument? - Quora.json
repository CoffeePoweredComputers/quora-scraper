            "answer_text": "In my own teaching, I am neither a \u201cno markers\u201d nor an \u201calways markers\u201d purist. I encourage my students to stay away from markers unless they find them helpful, in which case I let them put markers on in the early stages of learning. The remarks below will explain in a bit more detail. Tape, stickers, or other finger placement guides on the fingerboard are not recommended for the medium- to long-term learning of playing the cello. If you do apply position markers, you should only think of them as a stop-gap measure and not a permanent fixture on your fingerboard. Aim to develop a reliance on muscle memory, your musical ear, and accurate mental targeting of finger placement as early in your learning process as possible so that you avoid using the visual information of markers. I would actually start practice without using any markers on the instrument (although your learning materials should contain clear graphic guides, either photos or line drawings, to show you the geography of the finger placement for the notes that you\u2019re working on) to see how readily your fingers find the notes by feel and sound. Only apply markers if you\u2019re really struggling with targeting your finger placement and only apply the minimum number of marks to line up your hand correctly, e.g., for the first and fourth fingers only. Only look at your fingertips and the marks if your muscle memory and ear fail to target your fingers correctly. Definitely get help from an experienced cellist or other string player in applying the markers so that they are in the correct spot(s). Incorrectly placed markers will be much more harmful to building good habits than using no markers at all! You should not under any circumstances use a material such as electrical tape which has far too sticky an adhesive. I see many people using masking tape and others use dot stickers. This should not permanently damage your fingerboard if you avoid leaving these materials in place for too long; you\u2019re going to stop using them within a few months, anyway, if you\u2019re practising carefully. Your muscle memory and your ear will take over from your visual control if you train those two former skills. The longer you use the crutch of markers, the harder it will be to stop using them eventually. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not a good idea for several reasons. The first is that anything sticky will damage your fingerboard. You might have residue forever. Even tiny particles can tear up your fingertips when shifting. The second reason is the major one. If you rely on the tape for finger placement you will never really learn to listen carefully to your intonation. Worse yet, if your cello is not perfectly in tune, you will be badly out of tune when you put your fingers down \u201cin the right place\u201d. Third, guitar frets are not there to help you find the notes! They are there to make even stopped notes resonate like open strings. By putting your finger correctly right behind the fret you are giving the shortened string a hard point to vibrate from. The correct cello hand position is actually relaxed and comfortable, so if you start right away finding your notes by ear it becomes second nature quickly. ",
