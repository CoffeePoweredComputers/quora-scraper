            "answer_text": "A2A. I\u2019m sure there are other reasons, but I would point to the influence of live theater and vaudeville. When cinema was first invented, the American industry was centered in NYC; Broadway and vaudeville actors were hired to perform for the camera. They were used to broad gestures and facial expressions because \u201cbig\u201d acting was visible to spectators throughout a large, live venue. Since cinema was originally silent, broad gestures also helped to substitute for non-existent dialogue: movie acting was essentially a form of pantomime. This influence continued when talkies were invented and even through the early years of television. (Think of Lucille Ball\u2019s \u201cWaaaaaaaaaaa\u201d whenever Ricky caught on to her schemes, or Jackie Gleason\u2019s big \u201cTo the moon, Alice, to the moon!\u201d) Eventually, however, filmmakers realized that with a 40\u2032 high screen, faces were big enough they didn\u2019t require mugging to make a comic point. And all acting became more \u201crealistic\u201d, since cinema was the most influential art form of the 20th century. One still sees a certain amount of mugging on TV, particularly from children in cheesy sitcoms, but on the whole the style has been dropped as too over-the-top for filmed media. Not everyone considers the evolution I\u2019ve described a positive one. Some people find more artistry in the formalist mugging of the Three Stooges or Marx Brothers. They are less amused by the supposedly witty remarks on which sitcoms are based today. ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose in the acting industry nowadays it\u2019s a lot more serious. I remember starting a few years ago, and \u2018mugging\u2019 for the camera was something we found absolutely hilarious and fun. It\u2019s sort of like purposely making bloopers. It was really fun to do with your fellow cast. Nowadays, I feel like the industry\u2019s evolved to become very serious, and most actors (even A-list ones) just come to film, chat a bit and then head home - it\u2019s just their job to earn money, and they\u2019re not sticking around \u2018mugging\u2019 a camera. Though, I\u2019m not going to lie, I miss the old days! ",
