            "answer_text": "Compact Disc Digital Audio is the format stored on the disc and, along with the audio it contains other information such as track times and numbers, but when you strip away all the formatting used to store the audio information on a CD, what you have left - the raw audio - is encoded in a format known as Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM). LPCM can be thought of as the Lingua franca or \u2018common\u2019 standard for audio. If you ever hear audio described by it\u2019s bit and sample rates (for CD this is 16 bits per sample, 44,100 samples per second, per channel) then you are talking about LPCM. When you decode an mp3, AAC, Dolby or DTS movie soundtrack, unpack a Apple Lossless or FLAC file, you are getting LPCM. Whether or not any sort of lossless or lossy coding was used in any of these formats, LPCM is what is going to be output to the DAC. .wav and .aiff files are basically just containers for LPCM audio. With CD the original signal is LPCM (no lossless or lossy compression of any kind), but it gets broken up into smaller chunks before it\u2019s put on the disc and re-assembled on playback. This helps with error correction. I should just mention DSD which is the uncompressed audio format used in Sony\u2019s SACD discs. In spite of the similarity in name, the audio on these discs is encoded quite differently to CD and other LPCM sources - although some SACD discs are dual layer and the second layer is formatted in the same way as a normal CD.
