            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve got to say I agree with (most) everything said by the other responders. The first one I thought of when I saw the question, and one I\u2019m surprised is mentioned as often as he is, is Eric Clapton. Eric wanted to be a King. He really wanted to be BB but he would have settled for Freddie or Albert. He never reached those levels. Eric has always bored me. \u201cWonderful Tonight\u201d is MOR pablum of the worst sort. Taking any sentimentality out of it \u201cTears In Heaven\u201d is not a very good song. \u201cLay Down Sally\u201d is simply country music that has been done better by a thousand actual country players. \u201cI Shot The Sheriff\u201d was a great single but only because it\u2019s a great song to begin with. To give him credit where it is due he did some brilliant work with Cream. How is Eric Clapton like a cup of coffee? Both are much better with Cream. \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d is a truly brilliant track but it\u2019s The Beatles so it would be, wouldn\u2019t it? As a solo artist? Not so much. If you count Derek And The Dominos as a solo project he has done a grand total of one truly great song, \u201cLayla\u201d. On which he is playing with Duane Allman who, I have read, actually came up with that incredible riff and plays a large part of the solos. But to me his worst album by far is \u201cMe and Mr. Johnson\u201d. One of the few things I can agree on with Clapton was his high opinion of Robert Johnson. I\u2019ve read interviews in which he said that at one point he wouldn\u2019t even have conversations with people who couldn\u2019t appreciate Johnson\u2019s work. He ALSO stated that Robert Johnson was the one artist he didn\u2019t feel anyone (he included) could adequately cover. So of course he releases an album of Johnson covers. Old Eric had managed to suck every bit of feeling, style and groove out of the the songs and turn them into more of his \u201cSlowhand\u201d wanking. That album was a complete waste of plastic. But the thing that amazes me most about Clapton is that he somehow managed to get the reputation as \u201cGOD\u201d while Peter Green roamed the Earth. Green arguably didn\u2019t have the technical chops of Clapton but he had the feeling. And in Blues, \u201cFeeling\u201d is the most important part! Want proof? Put on \u201cMe and Mr. Johnson\u201d then follow it up with Green\u2019s \u201cRobert Johnson Songbook\u201d which came out six years prior to Clapton\u2019s album. Worlds apart. Blues should be about spirit, soul and getting down to the grit of the human experience on a personal level. Clapton not only lacked that but seemed incapable of even understanding how it should relate. Technically he\u2019s very proficient and well loved. But he just leaves me cold. ",

            "answer_text": "Great guitar players like Steve Vai and Joe Satriani, Yngie Malmsteen and the like are very technically capable. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into \u201ccreative\u201d when it comes writing meaningful songs. You see, the song is the thing. Malmsteen writes these opuses, and while they are impressive, they are not inspiring, at least not to me. Listening to his early stuff I found myself getting ear fatigue because he just didn\u2019t stop. No pauses, no breaks, just an endless stream of notes. I understood what he was doing, but I found it to be just so much \u201ctalking without saying anything\u201d meaningful. Steve Vai is unquestionably great. But every time I hear him play, he takes beautiful things and then starts throwing all this technique into the mix, subsequently destroying the beautiful thing he was creating. Oy. Joe Satriani is also a great player. When I first listened to \u201cSurfing With The Alien\u201d album, all I could hear was technique. I found the album to be weak in substantive writing, but strong on demonstrating all his technique - as if it was an audition tape. When I listen to a band, I want to hear music that actually touches me emotionally, even spiritually, in a way I can relate to as a listener - not just a musician. I know what all the musicians are doing (being multi-instrumental), and appreciate that. But without substance, a reason for the song to exist, I find a lot of music by \u201cvirtuoso\u201d players to be quite dry and empty of the things that matter to most people when they listen to music. When great players come together and pay attention to substance, creating music that means something to people apart from the band, just regular people - who are the majority of listeners - then you are applying your talents in a way that will have staying power. How many of these virtuoso players will still be remembered in 100 years? I guarantee less than one tenth of one percent. People want to be moved. People like Satch and Vai and Malmsteen don\u2019t do this as a rule. Guitar players want to be blown away. People like Satch and Vai and Malmsteen do this with most everything they produce. Speaking as a musician, I prefer to be moved, not blown away. Actually, if your music moves me, I am blown away at the beauty of the composition. And that means technique is not always going to accomplish this as much as a well crafted tune written by someone with less ability, technically. One musician\u2019s opinion. ",
