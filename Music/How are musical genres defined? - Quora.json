            "answer_text": "There are two main ways to go about it: formally (herein termed 'hard genre'), and informally/colloquially (herein called 'soft genre'). Hard Genre: An Academic Approach Hard genre is defined academically.  Academic definitions take into account things like temporal location (is this the '50s or the '90s?) and the idea that most artists embody a spectrum of expression rather than following a single formula of construction throughout their albums or career.  Hard genre relies on objective criteria that are formed into trait groupings based on subjective, but communicable, categorization methods. Music is perceived through its physical properties, which are affected by things like the instruments used, the recording and processing techniques employed, and the creative decisions regarding structure and format (time signature, having verses or choruses or bridges or whatnot, what kind of role the output intends to fulfill, etc).  Even though we have a subjective experience of music, these physical traits are largely capable of objective observation and delineation. So, this method is the same way animals and plants are categorized into phylum and species and such, which means there can still be academic debate at times, but instead of relying on subjective experiences of the music it relies on the subjective preference for how to associate groups of traits across artistic expressions and contexts. Soft Genre: Let The People Speak! Soft genre is defined culturally.  Artist propaganda, media misrepresentations, and rabid fan flame wars all influence the more circulated notions of how particular bands or musical expressions should be categorized.  It is not arbitrary in that it relies on finitely bound social dynamics and human psychology, but at its extremes, it is surely an 'anything goes' arena, and many bands and fan-groupings are known for inventing parodic or otherwise incoherent genre titles even if the music being described is of a style that is quite mundane or otherwise covered completely by more straightforward or traditional genre titles.  (Theatricality, or marketability, or recreational provocation.) Most styles of music have multiple conflicting or partially overlapping soft genre tags, especially because sounds, and perceptions of those sounds, can evolve over decades and the originating artists that are associated with the creation of new movements quite often refuse (or utterly lack the desire or ability) to categorize their creative direction as a means of distinction or branding.  \"Black metal\" bands did not start off calling themselves \"black metal,\" but Alec Empire shared his vision of \"digital hardcore\" from pretty early on with Atari Teenage Riot and other projects. The particular criteria used for soft genre determinations are personal and pretty much endless in their variety of mixing and matching ideas and preferences.  Sometimes people aim to purposely misrepresent, or to foster a greater acceptance or rejection of their labeled genres, but there are individuals that seek to be more conciliatory in their speech and try to find ways that best communicate their experiences to individuals that might enjoy similar experiences. A Final Comparison: Is There A Truth? Academic descriptions can be less emotionally charged, but academic definitions do not necessarily require a sterile title.  Someone studied (\"well-listened\") in music could explain to you how \"hard rock\" is categorically different from \"heavy metal,\" and note the parrying differences between the qualifications for each during every decade of their coexistence from an objective position of comparison.  Academic observations also try to include the perspective of a movement ethos, like how \"punk\" is a philosophical idea that governs musical expression beyond the simple mechanics of style, but soft genre can often better account for anachronistic sympathizing with particular philosophical attitudes. Cultural definitions are almost always non-uniformized between discussing parties, and sometimes contradict themselves within just 5-10 years of their usage due to growing exposure of new styles and the evolution of pioneering artists/groups.  Since sounds change so often---each year, each location, each album, sometimes even within the same song---genre definitions of any sort can never be more than an attempt to convey the most vital common denominators between musical expressions. Nuance is never a substitute for an actual experience, and both \"genre nazism\" and \"anti-genre nazism\" can do human experience a disservice. ",

            "answer_text": "It's moreso defined by critics and editors than by the bands themselves.  Mostly based on style; which is vague and oh-so-subjective.  For instance; \"progressive\" music is defined as having longer-than-normal song running times; alternate time-signatures, keys and tempos; and typically embracing elements of styles other than their dominant style.  So \"Progressive Metal\" will do all that yet incorporate Classical, Jazz, Country, etc..   It's ridiculously hard to \"categorize\" some music because it just fits in way too many categories.  There are so many overlaps and multi-genre bands these days that I predict within the next 50 years there will be a separate genre for every band.   They go so far as to separate \"Doom Metal\" from \"Viking Metal\" and \"Black Metal\" by subtle differences that often describe visual performance more than the actual sound of the music.  For instance, Amon Amarth writes tons of songs about Viking folklore, yet they're not considered \"Viking Metal\".  They're considered \"Death Metal\" because of their look.  And more than that, they're often considered \"Melodic Death Metal\" because they utilize more orchestration and chord structure derivatives than most Death Metal bands.   Every genre has multiple subgenres and then every subgenre has multiple sub-subgenres to the point that it gets rather ridiculous.  I've recently been relegated to organizing my music collection by category because it was taking me way too long to find things by artist name.  I agonized over the placement of certain things into certain categories until I thought, \"You know what, if I were looking for this, where would I look?\"  And I created categories that fit my personal descriptions and impressions of the music.  So Amon Amarth is in Viking Metal along with Bathory and Mortiis; since that's where'd I'd naturally look for them. To me categorization should be more about feeling than about breaking down things into their constituent parts, though one can argue that the constituent parts are sometimes what create the feeling.  If two or three songs feel the same, they likely are in the same category regardless of what makes them up.  And however they make you feel, that should be the name of the category.  I used certain conventions in naming my categories but many I came up with myself.  I used \"Horror Metal\" to include Rob Zombie, In This Moment, Motionless In White.  They're considered by society to be in other categories but that's the first place I'd look if I was searching for them.  I put OMD in \"Synthpop\" but Tears for Fears in \"New Wave\" for the same reason.   Categorizing by music critics and society is arbitrarily based on whoever comes up with the name first and finds similarities.  The only reason \"Post-Grunge\" exists and includes bands like, Lifehouse, Semisonic, Foo Fighters and Candlebox, is because those groups had the initial rock feel and a slightly higher production value, but still maintained a little of the grunge angst made popular by Nirvana, The Meat Puppets and Mother Love Bone.  Also, people naturally love to name stuff.  The first question ANY club owner, agent, friend, acquaintance etc. asks when you tell them you're in a band is always, \"What kind of music do you play?\" And usually nowadays the answer is \"We're sorta like <insert three dissimilar bands here> with a touch of <insert two more dissimilar bands here>.\"  No one wants to be pigeon-holed into a category, yet everyone wants to describe and define their sound based on other bands, since those other bands have already been included in categories and thus provide an easy, universally understood description of the type of music.  It plays into the basic fear of the unknown.  See the story of Rumpelstiltskin to understand the desire of humans to have power over things by naming them.  Also, categories help those with little actual music knowledge communicate and understand the styles.  If I say, \"We play mostly in dominant 6ths with occasional counterpoint subdivision including all three inversions overlapping enharmonically equivalent melody lines in multi-metric time signatures.\"  The average person would say, \".................\"  But if I say, \"We sound like Rush.\"  Then you instantly have a comparison.  I could then also say, \"We play progressive rock\" and that would work too.   So in summary there are certain technical distinctions, but no true hard lines defined by anything other than pop culture's desire to apply labels to everything. ",

            "answer_text": "Every style that \"catches on\" (meaning its description connects with the interest of thousands, preferably millions of listeners) evolves from a \"new fad\" or \"current thing\" into (after some years, usually, except there are notable examples of styles that were established very quickly) a full-blown phenomenon. Sometimes a genre arrives along with a dance that also has an arc of popularity of its own. To answer you directly, in Western culture the closest to a list of \"viable\" genres is decided by what sells, tops (radio, other) charts, and/or wins awards. The total number is roughly less than 20 major styles, and hundreds of sub-genres, most of which exist without big awards or huge audiences. Same as visual art... the possibilities are endless; not everything great sells well! To delve deeper, find the school(s) teaching what interests you! There are good music teachers all over the continent (N. America) where I live. Same for the rest of the globe. Many excellent musicians also teach privately. That's where if you can afford the $$ lessons, the really deep stuff (about who pioneered different genres and their playing secrets) gets passed to new musicians. Most great musicians are not self-taught, though some are. Often when an aspiring musician finds their \"niche\" in a certain genre, they can explain to you how they arrived at that place. Then some go on to master that genre or create a new one. If you are only trying to find styles as a listener, I suggest trying several popular music sites like http://allmusic.com , http://about.com and especially iTunes - Everything you need to be entertained. - Apple (I only typed itunes[DOT]com). There are zillions of places to explore styles online. YouTube and many others like New Music Videos, Premieres, Concerts & Original Shows (I only typed \"vevo[DOT]com\") have millions of \"free\" songs/videos. Endless blogs and forums discuss many styles in great depth. Several (iTunes, Google, Yahoo!, others) offer editor and user reviews that may fill in details for you about genres. I'll bet if you ask about some of your favorites here or other online forums, you'll learn this is a very big Q. Cheers and have fun exploring; it's a big world!  ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest way to differentiate any musical genre (like Classical, Rock, Popular or Pop or Folk Music etc) is the Musical Form or Musical Architecture, which refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. Another theoretical way to differentiate (which is much more difficult and complex way) lies in the musical modes that are used to build the musical form to compose their songs. For example Western Classical music uses mainly Ionian(major natural scale) and Aeolian (minor natural scale). On the other hand Indian classical uses melody based modes and scales called Ragas or Raag. Most of the pop, rock, jazz, blues and country uses mostly or mix of Dorian, Phrygian and Lydian modes on top of Ionian and Aeolian modes. Lastly folk music uses blend and mix of all such harmonic modes and melody based modes. So classification and differentiating starts becoming more complex just by listening, unless the composer hands over the Musical Form and Musical Modes for us to study and differentiate. ",
