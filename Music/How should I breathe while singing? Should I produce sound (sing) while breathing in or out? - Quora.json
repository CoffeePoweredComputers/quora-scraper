            "answer_text": "The singing is basically the breathing out part - your voice is produced when your vocal cords resist the air that is passing through. Breathing is a huge topic itself. There are whole disciplines about breathing. But to start with, when you sing make sure you are not lifting your shoulders up. That is a very shallow breath, that can feel like deep because it takes a lot of effort. The best way to breath in for singing is to use the lower part of your lungs for what you will need to engage your diaphragm. Some people call it belly breathing but is not exactly that. This kind of breathing allows your upper body to be relax, which you need to produce sound freely. You can check my web page where I have a free training that will help you with that.https://holisticvoiceacademy.com ",

            "answer_text": "You ideally need lessons in order to learn proper techniques, but what I can tell you is that most people who just sing casually breathe wrong. Most people breathe using their intercostal muscles [the muscles between your ribs], but ideally for singing, you should breathe using your abdominal [stomach] muscles and your diaphragm. ",
