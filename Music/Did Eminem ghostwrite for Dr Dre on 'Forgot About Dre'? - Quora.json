            "answer_text": "Want to start by saying doctor Dre is a musical revolutionary. His influence on hip hop is unquestionable so answering this question by no means is taking any thing from him. To answer question ..yes most if not all of chronic \u201c2001\u201d album was ghost writtin by various artists including Eminem,also Jay z, Royce 59 had there ink on it. Weather his projects before that were him writing it or not I don't know. But anyone who has an ear/appreciation for lyricism on any advanced level such as multi syllable rhyme schemes and word play can easily tell how drastically different his lyrical skill is from his pre Eminem career. One of the greatest examples is the song \u201cwatcher\u201d which has Eminem all over it. The ingenious rhymes schemes and rhyming words that don't usually rhyme is something em is renown for. Not saying that Dre can't rap him self but as far as lyrics go he didn't just rap a certain way his whole life then over nite meet Eminem and become such a high level lyricist on his own. Obviously one if not greatest producers ever and makes great records so mad respect to him. This is just answering question from lyrical ghost writing stand point nothing more ,nothing less. ",

When it comes to producing, Dr. Dre is in my personal Top 3 or all time yet he ALWAYS had someone writing his lyrics. For the \u201cChronic 2001\u201d album, alot of his verses were written by Jay-Z. You can hear a lot of Jay-Z\u2019s style and cadence on \u201cStill DRE.\u201d But Ultimately, Em did the writing for Dre on and my track in which they both appeared. ",
