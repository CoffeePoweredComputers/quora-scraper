            "answer_text": "It depends on why you want the braids and how you behave while wearing them. Costume or cosplay MINUS the blackface? Go for it. \u201cTalking black\", and looking like your definition of how you define \u201cghetto black\". Absolutely racist. You being you, whoever that is, with box braids? Not racist. Just know you will get stares and maybe comments. Many times, what white women consider a cute copy of a traditionally black hairstyle, would be considered ghetto and ratchet on the black girl (by large society), and that's why many of us do not appreciate appropriation. White women fail to stand up for us, leave us behind with their protest even though they have it better in almost every way, and hijack #MeToo, but want to copy us. Not trying to argue, just explaining. That's why dressing like some beered up version of the indigenous, why having your sports teams names as their tribes or cultural positions within the tribe, is so horrendously disrespectful. ",

            "answer_text": "Had to look up the terminology. Old as the hills dating back to Namibia or the Congo Nile. The first I saw them was in the 60s. With love beads as part of the weave. Beads were the signal that the hippie culture was being embraced. It was not a racist thing at all. Subculture signaling. If you are arguing that origination is a virtue and only used by someone of that background: that\u2019s trouble. Though I will admit the Irish and Scots sure had the dander up when dancers on the Soul Train line dance were wearing tartan plaids. I made that up. I liked the use of the weave. Also not present were the box braids. Fans buying Beatles wigs in the 60s weren\u2019t trying to appropriate or promote British culture. Beatlemania. People buying Levi\u2019s are not promoting German culture. Folks getting X-rays are not promoting Polish or French culture. I don\u2019t want to know who invented ____, in case I am accused of cultural appropriation. Biggest I don\u2019t care: plates, silverware, underwear, pillows, stainless steel, flip-flops, eyeglasses, air conditioning, soap, peanut butter, whiskey, windows, stucco \u2026 I am not making racist connotations by using those things. I like them. If someone likes a style or aspect they may be at best a copycat. You either have to apply it completely or realize that it\u2019s a big world and we share our joys. ",
