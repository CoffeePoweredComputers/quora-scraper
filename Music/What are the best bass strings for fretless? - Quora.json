            "answer_text": "There are no \u201cbest bass strings for fretless\u201d, just like there are no \u201cbest singers\u201d. It is a matter of taste, and adaptability to your style. There have been \u201cfretless\u201d basses since Bach, but for electric fretless bass, you have to first look at the master:  Jaco is to fretless electric bass what George Washington is to American Presidents. You may argue that someone later was better, but he set the standard so high, it has taken us 240 years to throw that out the window. Jaco didn\u2019t look at the fretless bass as a means to an end. He didn\u2019t want to just go \u201cBwwawww\u201d. He wanted to do whatever he wanted on bass unrestricted by the bounds of frets. He wanted freedom. Commonly, bassists use tapewound or flatwound strings on fretless basses, because it gives a muted \u201cthump\u201d to the sound and more closely apes the sound of a double bass. Jaco wanted the fretless to sing. So he used the brightest bass strings available at the time - the Rotosound 66 \u2033swing bass\u201d strings:   They are roundwound strings, which increase the brightness and make the strings \u201cslipperier\u201d as the fingers skate across the top of the wind. I believe VERY strongly that these are the best strings possible for fretless. The sound is amazing and very very consistent. Some complain that the strings are hard on the hands, to which I say - \u201cyou are a bassist, suck it up\u201d. Also, it is said that they are hard on the finish of the neck, which is why Jaco put a varnish on the neck. Bare wood fretless basses are in my mind, crazy dumb. It\u2019s a steel string, people! Four strings, a board, and a couple of pickups. Heaven.  ",

            "answer_text": "This is my bass (well, a google image of an identical one):  It\u2019s a \u201978 Precision fretless I\u2019ve had since new. It\u2019s the only bass I\u2019ve every played extensively. I play mostly blues/rock and have always aspired to the Jaco sound. The bass has always been challenging to get a sound with. But when you get that sound, man it\u2019s like nothing else. It\u2019s powerful, punchy and really melodic. I\u2019m mindful of neck-wear and could never bring myself to string it with round wounds and I don\u2019t like the sound of flats so I\u2019ve always used these:  They seem to be fairly easy on the neck (though I\u2019ve refinished it a couple of times over the years) and they sound great. You can get an idea of what the bass sounds like on this: Brian's Bolero Edit: Actually this one is a better example of the bass\u2019s sound: Summer of Bud ",
