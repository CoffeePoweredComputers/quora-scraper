            "answer_text": "It\u2019s too difficult for me to limit my answer to just one musician. Also, there are a few different categories of musicians who have inspired me to a great degree. Conductors (of symphony orchestras): Michael Tilson Thomas (MTT), Charles Dutoit, Bernard Haitink, Fritz Reiner, Lorin Maazel, Gustavo Dudamel, Yuri Temirkanov just to name a few. One thing I greatly respect about MTT is that not only is he a great conductor, but he is quite an accomplished pianist as well, and he has, on occasion, performed as a piano soloist on stage at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco. Pianists: Vladimir Ashkenazy, Zoltan Kocsis, Jeremy Denk, Peter Donohoe, Garrick Ohlsson, David Allen Wehr, Yefim Bronfman, Yuja Wang, Alan Feinberg and several others. Organists: Michael Murray, Christopher Herrick, Simon Preston, Jean Guillou, Peter Hurford, Markus Wargh. Guitarists: Angel and Pepe Romero (pretty much the entire Romero guitar family), Elliot Fisk, John Williams, Christopher Parkening. Composers: J.S. Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Sergei Prokofiev, Claude Debussy, Dmitri Shostakovich, Aaron Copland, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Samuel Barber, Robert Nathaniel Dett, and plenty more. In my current \u201clava lamp of musical favorites\u201d, which ones are currently floating at or near the top this week? Probably MTT (since he\u2019s local), Peter Donohoe (can\u2019t get enough of his Prokofiev piano sonatas 6, 7, and 8), Christopher Herrick (his \u201cOrgan Fireworks\u201d CD), and perhaps Shostakovich. But this list could be completely different next month. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll be over the top, and answer your question categorically.. Musicians. What do you consider a musician? Singers? Singer-Songwriters (people who write their own songs?) Producers (the people who make the melodies and the beats.) Singers (Vocalists) 1. Ariana Grande \u2014 I don\u2019t care what you think about her.. You must admit her vocals are phenomenal. Forget her lyrics and her songs. Think about her voice.. It\u2019s amazing  2. Florence Welch \u2014 a beautiful human being who has the most angelic and passionate voice i\u2019ve ever heard. She has a few hit songs. She\u2019s just amazing, and she sounds beautiful.  Singer-Songwriters 1. Mikky Ekko\u2014 He\u2019s a nobody, basically. The only song that\u2019s ever been a hit was Stay, but it was because Rihanna took his song.. But this guy is legendary.. I listen to many genres like R&B, Alternative, Punk, Pop, EDM, Hip Hop, Rock\u2026 I\u2019ve heard many artists, but his music is the best.. It comes from his soul, and it\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019ve never heard a song from his that sucked. Definitely give it a listen.  2 Jaymes Young \u2014 another singer-songwriter that\u2019s not that popular. He\u2019s amazing. His music comes from someplace real. I\u2019ve never heard a song from his catalogs that isn\u2019t good.  Producers Cashmere Cat\u2014One of the first producers I fell in love with. He makes melodies and beats.. And you might be thinking, how do melodies or beats give off emotion and genuine and powerful feelings? Cashmere cat does it, and he does it so well.  This first one is just an instrumental, but I honestly listened to that on replay\u2014 believe it or not.. It is just an instrumental track, but there\u2019s so much latched onto it.. When there\u2019s just music and no lyrics, you\u2019re able to make the song yours. Your able to paint your own pictures and your own feelings, and you attach it to the song. When I listen to this song, I automatically think about my first year of high school. I remember how happy I was, I remember my friendships. I remember good times, automatically, and the song just makes me feel good now. Diplo \u2014 The EDM king himself. Under his side project, Major Lazer, he is able to hit mainstream radio time after time, charting all the freakin time.. Under his \u201cDiplo\u201d alias, he is still an EDM legend with many fans\u2014 most of which are EDM fans, not mainstream pop music fans..  ",
