            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Simple answer is No. As an aside, why does she need to be the next Lata? Coming back to the question, Lata was a product of the times as much as of her own talent and hard work. She veritably personified the Golden Era of Hindi film music. She was known across the length and breadth of the country (and beyond) when communications and mass media were very limited. She reigned supreme for over 3 decades, 2 of which had truly outstanding songs. A number of songs sung by her are known 60 years after they were originally sung. Nothing from recent times can match that kind of longevity. Of course only time will tell whether Shreya will be remembered as much as Lata. She has achieved a lot, and all the best to her. ",

            "answer_text": "Shreya Ghoshal certainly has the talent to steal an award from among the best female singers in the industry currently. But, what I am seeing is that she is not getting much recognition like Neha Kakkar and Palak Muchhal. When asked, Lata Mangeshkar did praise her voice. But, she needs more fame and melodies to regain her past popularity. Some of her greatest hits are: Suna Suna LamhaDeewani MastaniRadhaSamjhawanItti Si Hassi",
