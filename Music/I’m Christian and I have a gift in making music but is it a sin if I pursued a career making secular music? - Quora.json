            "answer_text": "There\u2019s been an unwarranted suspicion of popular music in some churches since the 1950s. In reality, there\u2019s been constant to-ing and fro-ing between Christian and secular music going back to the middle ages. Something which is important for those of us who are Christians is to be consistent in our beliefs and their application. Inconsistency lets sin through while barring things which are not sin. So, consider theses questions: Is it a sin for a Christian banker to handle secular money, or should he only handle \u2018Christian\u2019 money (whatever that is)?Is it a sin for a Christian doctor to use treatments which weren\u2019t invented by Christians?Is it a sin for a Christian truck-driver to drive a truck not entirely constructed by Christians using only \u2018Christian\u2019 fuel?These are ridiculous examples, but if we don\u2019t require Christians in other professions to only do Christian things, we shouldn\u2019t require Christian musicians to only make \u2018Christian\u2019 music.

            "answer_text": "Any church that makes you fearful of human joy is a church to avoid. I know people who experienced religious conversions who then dumped all of their secular music and declared that dancing was a sin, but I understood these to be signs of a nervous breakdown coupled with an unfortunately timed encounter with a religiously-themed con man. Admittedly, it got a copy of Nickleback\u2019s Greatest Hits out of their house, so it was not entirely a bad thing, but in the main was a sign that they were uneasy with themselves and needed to spend some time reconnecting with what made them feel happy, healthy, and whole. And sure, we all know about those dour sects from previous centuries who thought this world was a vale of tear, and so we might as well do everything possible to make life as bleak and sorrowful as possible, that we might welcome death as a relief when it came, but those sects died out for a reason. Go on, make the music that only you can make, in the whole history of the world. We all need more joy. ",
