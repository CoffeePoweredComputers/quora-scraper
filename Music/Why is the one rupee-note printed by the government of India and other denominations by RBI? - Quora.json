            "answer_text": "Reserve Bank Of India was established in 1935, and was nationalized in 1949. Prior to that all notes were issued on behalf Ministry of Finance, the ultimate monetary authority for Indian Currency. Subsequently it delegated the currency issuing authority to RBI. Only as a matter of convention the one rupee note continued to be signed by Finance Secretary. This was probably prior to 1949 one rupee note was the highest denomination note in circulation. The one rupee note went out of circulation after 1994 and were treated as token currency note. Thus, the one rupee note is different from the rest of the notes.  It is the token currency of the country while the rest of the notes are bank notes or currency notes. Also, it is signed by the finance minister instead of the Governor of RBI and does not has the pledge  \"I promise to pay the bearer a sum of XXX rupees..\" Let us first understand what this pledge indicate. It means that the reserve bank of the country promises that the person who possesses the currency note (i.e the bearer) will be eligible to be paid goods worth the amount mentioned on that currency note. The pledge is not printed on One Rupee note. This is because the RBI guarantees the bearer of its note, a sum equal to the denomination of such bank note in token currency notes like rupee one note. If a crisis arises the government is responsible for exchanging the higher currency bank notes by an equal denomination of the token currency notes.So ultimately it's the government upholding the promise of paying the bearer.
