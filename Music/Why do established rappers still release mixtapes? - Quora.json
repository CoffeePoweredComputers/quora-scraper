            "answer_text": "Okay, to begin, let's think about what a \"mixtape\" is. While the definition has changed a lot in recent years, the most current technical definition of a mixtape is a collection of music released for free.  By releasing the music for free, the artist doesn't have to worry (in most situations) about clearing samples or getting specific permission. The artist also can release their work knowing that fans can listen without feeling the pressure (if they do anymore) to buy music.  Historically, while not always true, mixtapes also serve as opportunities for artists to release lesser quality work and build their fanbases. Mixtapes typically aren't as polished as albums and they generally come across as a selection of songs, as opposed to a body of work.  However, that all changed when Drake, in 2009, released So Far Gone. It consisted of entirely original work, sounded very cohesive, and was free. Drake changed the game for mixtapes.  Now, fast forward five years (exactly...Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late on the 5 year anniversary of So Far Gone) and Drake again challenges the norm, this time in a different way. His surprised release wasn't free, but he called it a mixtape. The project contained all original work, was cohesive and was only released via iTunes. However, Drake referred (and refers) to it as a mixtape!  Technically, it is an album. Drake has made and will continue to make a lot of money from it. So then, why does he refer to it as a mixtape? Simple. Drake has been working a lot recently on his upcoming album Views From the 6. He also recognizes he's the biggest hip-hop artist around and is trying to be as competitive and innovative as possible. In the process of making all of this music for his album, he realized that he has way too many good songs to fit onto one album. There are several tracks that don't fit the album, either quality wise or thematically, that he wishes for his fans to hear.  As a result, Drake released IYRTITL. It cost him nothing from a marketing standpoint since it was a surprise release, he made a lot of money off of it, and it placed Drake back on the front pages of music and news magazines all across the world.  That is why Drake dropped a surprise \"mixtape\". ",

In most cases, it's not for money, just to have new material out and give the fans something to enjoy between albums.  As Lawrence said, Drake's \"mixtape\" technically wasn't a mixtape at all...but Drake can do that. ",
