            "answer_text": "You should learn that the Em pentatonic scale is movable. Learn the pattern up and down the neck and how the various patterns are connected. Then, you learn that the scale Is movable. If you learn the Em pentatonic scale, you know it in all the other minor keys. The cool thing about the minor pentatonic scales is that they ALSO are the patterns for the MAJOR pentatonic scales. (Learn the \u201crelative major\u201d to the minor scale). For instance the Em Pentatonic is also the G Major Pentatonic scale\u2026. You just start on a different note (the G) and use the same pattern. After you learn that, learn the chord patterns that are associated with each of those patterns. The CAGED system helps you learn how those patterns work up and down the neck and how to use the patterns over any chord progression. Then, pracitce the heck out of what you have learned. Use the Pentatonic scales you are using to play melodies to the songs you are learning. Many songs follow that pentatonic pattern\u2026. Many don\u2019t\u2026. Learn how those melodies differ from the ones that follow the Pentatonic scales. That is probably enough for now. The guitar is something you never stop learning new stuff with. That\u2019s the wonderful thing about it. Good luck and enjoy the journey. ",

            "answer_text": "Like Stephen said, practice that same scale in different keys. You don\u2019t want to get stuck just playing in E like I did in the beginning. Maybe try the Am pentatonic next. You already know the patterns, you\u2019ll just be doing them in a different place on the neck. As far as learning the relative major, that\u2019s basically the same thing. If you can play the minor pentatonic in any key then you are already playing the relative major. For instance the Am pentatonic is the exact same, from a finger pattern perspective, as the C major pentatonic. After learning to play the minor pentatonic in several positions, I\u2019d move on to the natural major scale myself. That\u2019s the second scale most instructors give after the pentatonic. ",
