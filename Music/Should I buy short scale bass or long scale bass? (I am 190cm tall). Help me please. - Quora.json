            "answer_text": "Pick one you like the sound of. Short and long scale basses DO sound different\u2026 not because you can\u2019t shape the tone, of course you can. But the scale length means the string responds differently to the amount of energy circulating in it. A plucked string gets a little stretched when it is vibrating hard, which means it starts out sounding sharp and falls back to its true pitch. Shorter scale means lower tension, which means the amount you put in to play it is larger, which increases this effect. That\u2019s a major thing in \u2018djent\u2019 guitar, they\u2019ve tuned the guitars with their really short scales to bass notes, and the pitch is all over the place. If you like pure and tight intonation, you want a long scale. I love my multi-scale Dingwall\u2019s 37\u2033 B-string\u2026 that\u2019s really long. A double bass is typically 43.5\u2033, I really like mine because it has an extra-long 45.25\u2033 scale. But I\u2019d never say you were wrong to like a short-scale bass. I just like them long. While I\u2019m reasonably tall (179cm) I have quite small hands (size medium gloves). I\u2019ve seen 155cm women playing double bass\u2026 your height has nothing to do with the scale lengths you like to play, or are physically capable of playing. Take a look at this picture of the Dingwall to see what the differences actually are (this is my actual instrument):  The scale lengths on this bass are 33.25\u2033, 34\u2033, 34.75\u2033, 35.5\u2033, 36.25\u2033 and 37\u2033. A \u201cstandard\u201d scale is 34\u2033, the same as the second-shortest string on that ABZ. A \u201cshort\u201d scale is typically 32\u2033 or a little less, about where the first fret is on the shortest string on the ABZ. Ibanez make some \u201cmicro\u201d scale basses at 28.8\u2033, about where second fret is. Guitar scale lengths are around 5th or 6th fret on this bass. The width of the picture is very close to the standard double bass 43\u2033 scale\u2026 and mine is another 2.25\u2033 more than that. You might look at that and think it would be very hard to play\u2026 not really, you get used to it in a few minutes, and after playing it for a few hours it feels completely natural. ",

            "answer_text": "Used to be, the scale of the bass kind of mattered because bass pickups and amps were pretty primitive. There was a tonal difference, so the sound you were seeking (and the kind and length of strings) all figured into scale length. These days, you can sculpt tones so much with gear (and bass pickups/strings have improved a lot) so it\u2019s more a matter of using a bass that doesn\u2019t tear up your body, and a scale that fits your hand size comfortably for the style you play. There are no rules, other than sometimes a trade-off between a bass that looks really cool but might be physically limiting. There\u2019s a minor drawback to short-scale necks in that they encourage playing the bass more like a guitar. Basses with longer scales make it harder to play \u2018scaley\u2019 or \u2018chordy\u2019 kind of bass and make you focus more on thumping out rhythms. That\u2019s usually a good thing on the bass.
