            "answer_text": "You know, I really had to think about this one\u2026. And I can\u2019t argue with the pro Van Halen opinion. But I actually think Brad Gillis is more talented. He replaced Randy Rhoads on tour within a week of his death. Gil is had to learn all those tunes\u2026 in less than a week! And with no ego, he did it, and proved himself worthy among the guitar gods. And then went on to form Night Ranger, where he did quite a few impressive solos. Is his technique similar to Van Halen? Yes. Did Van Halen make two hand tap popular before Gillis started doing it? Probably. But I give the most credit to guys who can walk into any situation and nail it. I don\u2019t think Van Halen would have worked well in any other situation other than Van Halen (Michael Jackson solo session aside - so maybe they\u2019re equals on that point). ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the a2a. I\u2019ve answered versions of this question a bunch of times already but this time I guess I feel like being a little more concise. Who\u2019s the better guitar player? Which do you prefer to listen to? Go with that one. It\u2019s a meaningless concept. Music is art and art is about the feelings it stirs within you and not about the technical skill of the artists. I don\u2019t care how fast someone can play because I promise you that there\u2019s always someone faster and it doesn\u2019t matter one bit. Listen to what makes you feel and ignore everyone who tells you something else is better. ",
