Maybe some people just hear the word \u2018Grunge\u2019 as a really ugly word which they hate, and then when they hear the music this determines their reaction to it. Or they may just listen to it without any feeling about the name, but find it strongly offensive to their ears. Not everyone likes everything. ",
