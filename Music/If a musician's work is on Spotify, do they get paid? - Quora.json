You may also notice some of the amounts are different, even for the same song. I can assure you they are exactly copied from my accounting page. I double-checked, and there are no typos. Bottom line - streaming services are fantastic tools to getting music out there. But as long as they are giving them away for free, or for nearly free, there is no money to be made in streaming by the artists. ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot speak for all artists, but I am an independent artists with six solo piano albums and several singles on Spotify, mostly due to being registered on cdbaby. I am happy to report that these songs are streamed about 1 million times per year (total, not each) and that Spotify pays roughly 1/10th or 2/10ths of a cent per stream. That is a nice revenue stream for a completely unknown artist as myself. I am streamed significantly more than that on Pandora, which pays about the same or slightly more. Also relative newcomer\u2019s Apple Music and Amazon Premium pay as much as 7/10ths Of a penny per stream, but their volume is nowhere near-yet-that of Pandora and Spotify. ",
