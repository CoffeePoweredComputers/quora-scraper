            "answer_text": "In a sense, yes. Not traditional goth (i.e. Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure, Bauhaus, The Cult, The Sisters of Mercy, The Birthday Party, etc.), but a second or third wave of goth, and he may or may not care about being called goth. After all, it\u2019s just a label. Most of the bands listed above are goth rock bands that he grew up listening to, but he also has other artistic influences that aren't goth. (Queen, Alice Cooper, David Bowie, Led Zepplin, etc.) Many people will say that he isn't goth, but they don't care to do their research on Manson, his musical background, or listen to his music. They have what is called \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d, an unwillingness to accept the facts, even when proven to be true. Songs by Marilyn Manson that are Goth rock or influenced by Goth rock include Coma White, Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon, I Have To Look Up Just To See Hell, Blood Honey, Valentine's Day, Cupid Carries A Gun, and Warship My Wreck. Pretty much every album he's made have some goth rock roots. Mechanical Animals (the album, 1998) was influenced by glam and goth rock bands, and his 6th album Eat Me, Drink Me (2007) is his first, and so far, only fully fledged goth rock album. Goth and industrial rock bands such as Joy Division, The Birthday Party, Revolting Cocks, Bauhaus, and Killing Joke were primary influences on his 8th album Born Villain (2012). For his 9th album, The Pale Emperor (2015), one of his influences was Jim Morrison and the Doors, who are the first band to be considered Goth rock. If you don't believe it, do some research on him and you'll be surprised. Listen to his music and the artists that influenced him and you'll hear it. (First, listen to Exercise one by Joy Division and then Warship My Wreck and then Slice of Life by Bauhaus and then Coma White.) Don't just listen to any joe schmo who spouts off their opinion and says he\u2019s not goth because opinions are like anuses: everyone has one and they all stink. ",

            "answer_text": "Ahh, there has always been difficulty surrounding the beloved Brian Warner (A.K.A Marilyn Manson). Is he a goth? I'm not convinced. His music is not technically exemplar of 'gothic rock'. He probably grew up listening to the iconic goth bands of the 80's like The Cure and Sisters of Mercy, but his music is of a new era, a new generation. I suppose this can be explained with the fact that the gothic-rock genre is not as popular as it once was, and maybe Marilyn Manson is trying to reflect this. We see many defining characteristics of a genre bend and mould slightly to fit the times. I believe this is what is happening here. I don't think it should be though. His influence seems to me to be a little on the heavier side and is not reflective of the true gothic genre. His look most definitely adheres to some elements of the gothic aesthetic, yes. ",
