            "answer_text": "iKON are one of the biggest groups of the year already! Let\u2019s get to know the members with 14 fun facts: 1. Chan has played a younger Lee Min-ho in dramas Boys Over Flowers and The Heirs. 2. Ju-ne went on Star King as a child and slayed his Michael Jackson performance. He can still imitate the legend to this day. 3. DK was an intelligent student when he was at school, his fellow members are clueless as to why he\u2019d want to become a singer (I guess DK solves all the math problems for the group haha). 4. Bobby was able to bring his parents to Korea with the earnings he made from winning rap survival show Show Me The Money. 5. Yunhyeong likes to make fun of other members in the group but hates it when people make fun of him. 6. YG claims that Jay is the next Taeyang (dope comparison, congratz). 7. When B.I. writes songs he uses his imagination because he\u2019s never been in a relationship before. 8. Chan is the maknae of the group and used to be scared of B.I. These days he\u2019s scared of Bobby (maknae problems). 9. According to the members, Ju-ne used to be the least fashionable of the group (thankfully now they have a stylist). 10. YG\u2019s daughter says her favourite member is DK (that\u2019s one very important fan girl! Haha). 11. Bobby is known to sleep talk and never skip breakfast in the morning (he probably talks about whats he\u2019s gonna eat in his sleep). 12. Yunhyeong\u2019s family own a BBQ restaurant, which is probably why he\u2019s good at cooking (he\u2019s nicknamed Song Chef by the members). 13. iKON members say Jay is extremely flirtatious with the fans and even the staff (maybe he\u2019s just really polite haha). 14. When B.I. was asked who he would like to have as a son from the members he said no one. Although if he had to choose he\u2019d pick Yunhyeong because of his kindness. ",
