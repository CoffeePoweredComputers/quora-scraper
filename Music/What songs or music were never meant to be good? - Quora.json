            "answer_text": "What songs or music were never meant to be good? Back in 1968 a band called The Turtles recorded a song called Elenore. This was in the Stone Age: no personal computers, no internet, three commercial TV networks, etc. You had to buy vinyl records if you wanted your own copy of a song. The Turtles previously had a hit with a song called Happy Together. They were looked upon as sort of a lightweight band with none of the gravitas of The Beatles or The Rolling Stones. But they had ambitions of expanding their stylistic repertoire and recording their own music. They hoped to be taken more seriously. The problem was that their record company in its corporate wisdom wanted The Turtles to have another hit record like Happy Together. The record company wanted to make money while The Turtles wanted to make music. The band was not pleased with what they considered to be a creative box into which the recording company was putting them. To deal with their frustration, The Turtles recorded Elenore. Elenore is reminiscent of Happy Together, with a very similar beat and a similar chord structure, which is exactly what the record company wanted. It\u2019s actually quite a catchy tune, but the lyrics are rather non-sensical, with the term et cetera being used at one point. I\u2019m not aware of any other song where et cetera is used in the lyrics. There\u2019s probably one out there someplace, but I haven\u2019t heard it. With its rather oddball lyrics, The Turtles recorded Elenore as a satire aimed squarely at their record company because they didn\u2019t want to record a song which was a clone of Happy Together. But the record company suits just didn\u2019t get the joke. Elenore was recorded, and even though the band didn\u2019t want the song to be taken seriously it turned out to be very well-produced song and was a hit. Personally, I like it better than Happy Together. This pattern of composers and performers coming up with musical compositions which they hold in low regard and yet which go on to become very popular is pretty common in the world of music, even in classical music. It just goes to show that you never really know what\u2019s going to work. ",
