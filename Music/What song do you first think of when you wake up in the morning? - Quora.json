            "answer_text": "I had my playlist running as I did my paperwork right before lights out. When I got up to pee, it was still rattling around up there in the ol' skull cavity. That's because there's nothing up there to stop it. So, I guess it should come as no surprise that it was still an ear worm when I got up this morning.
