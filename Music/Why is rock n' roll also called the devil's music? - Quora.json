            "answer_text": "It might sacrifice you to that which doesn\u2019t love you in return. The musicians often do drugs and act promiscuously. And the lyrics are often about doing drugs and acting promiscuously. The reason why those things are satanic is they sacrifice you to things that don\u2019t love you back. Pleasure and loud chorus aren\u2019t defined as satanic in the Bible, actually the opposite is true. You know those rock concerts? Those are great things. You see people waving their arms and signalling the singers and trying to get close, and you see them screaming their affection. You see that people have an urge to outlet affection and energy and passion. But, after the show and after every one of the great many concerts I\u2019ve been to, you see the drinks and the alcohol and the people laughing without knowing why it\u2019s funny and falling asleep and waking, disorientated and heartbroken and waiting for the next one. I used to think that stoning was a terribly misplaced rock n roll stereotype but now, I\u2019ve found that these things happen. I think there\u2019s new ground to cover in rock n roll. Sometimes people holler, \u201cSex, drugs and rock n roll\u201d but other times, people holler, \u201cPeace, love and rock n roll\u201d What creates peace and love in this society? Real and assured peace and love? There needs to be a foundation for peace and love that isn\u2019t reliant on material or even, on people. What\u2019s missing is God. If we involve God who the Bible says lasts and loves us back, with pure love, that would then be un-satanic. It\u2019s not a music problem. ",

            "answer_text": "Racism. Rock and roll was originally an African-American music. Every black music style is vilified as a threat to our nation's youth until it's completely co-opted by white musicians, at which point it becomes innocuous and \"classic.\" This 1921 article from Ladies Home Journal asks, Does Jazz Put the 'Sin' in Syncopation? Now they play jazz at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. Rock has similarly become safe enough to be embraced by extreme religious conservatives. Here's Mike Huckabee sitting in with Def Leppard:    Right now, there's considerable moral panic over hip-hop, but already, respectability is starting to creep in around the edges. No doubt, a generation from now, hip-hop will be totally anodyne, and America will have moved on to hate and fear whatever black kids are enjoying. ",
