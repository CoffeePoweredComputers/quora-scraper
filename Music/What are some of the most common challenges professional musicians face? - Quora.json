(Again, intense competition).Most people who graduate intending to teach music in schools find that the programs are being de-funded and, again, many prospects for few jobs.I am sure there are other factors, but these are the ones that come to mind immediately.

I'm no professional musician and have a past career in admin. banking with the future looking to move into a peer support worker! But I enjoy the challenge of this one\u2026 What are some of the most common challenges professional musicians face? Without going into depth I thought I would provide you with seven challenges that professional musicians face: Challenge #1: Wearing too many hats Challenge #2: Finding reliable band members Challenge #3: Maintaining energy Challenge #4: Building support Challenge #5: Not getting discouraged Challenge #6: The competition Challenge #7: Staying motivated These challenges are brief and bring home the point. To me I found the message is to keep it simple, have people who will be there and finding energy. Learn who are your support through the process. Try not to let things get you down. A really important issue is being aware of your competition. When you start out, there will be a fire in your belly that will need to be maintained. If you love what you do and enjoy having fun it won't seem like a job or work. Your days will pass very quickly and you will have some great memories. Also, if you make a mistake, stop, think about it, learn from it and try not to make the same mistake again! So have fun in making music for us to listen to! xx wendy ",

            "answer_text": "Nikolaos, to me the most difficult challenge is making a living doing what you have chosen as your life\u2019s profession. The music industry is competitive and ever changing. You have to showcase yourself and be recognized as your peers are doing the same. This can be even more of a challenge if you happen to be a member of the music genre currently in vogue. Think how many more artists of that genre are trying to do so. Another difficulty is finding and keeping an audience. You might be lucky enough to be part of a genre like rock who still have fans long after the genre itself has waned. Or you could have been a disco era musician who had a short lived genre and has since struggled to remain relevant to fans. These are difficulties for sure, but think how hard any of this would be if you were not a star in your field. Everyone involved in this process has a financial incentive. Club owners, managers and music producers are looking for acts that will make them money. They have to see the \u2018win\u2019 in taking on you and your music. If they don\u2019t see you as at least a \u2018cash calf\u2019 you won\u2019t make much money. And by the way, the competition never ceases. ",

            "answer_text": "For me the challenges depend on what the musician is doing at the time. If he\u2019s touring, it won\u2019t matter if he\u2019s playing cover songs or his own stuff. What matters is exhaustion. I know so many musicians are self conscious about their image so they won\u2019t admit that exhaustion\u2019s a big reason they get involved with drugs. As a singer you don\u2019t want to drink alcohol, because it dilates the vessels in your vocal chord and your voice will suffer. So, as a \u201cpick me up,\u201d many of them turn to other stimulants. Whatever they choose is strictly a personal choice since everyone is different. If they\u2019re recording original stuff, the biggest challenge is coming up with new stuff that\u2019s as good as the first stuff. Usually a musician has no trouble having material already on hand, because they\u2019ve been writing it for years and had plenty of struggle and adventures to inform the songs on the first recording. The second or third album might be tougher, because the biggest challenge you\u2019ve faced since your first album and successful tour was missing luggage and bad food. ",

Those that are performing (or doing studio work) for 100% of their income have it tougher to have a home/personal life, they\u2019re constantly on the road touring. A few others seem to be able to do teaching as well as performing, and I\u2019m referring to two fellow musicians who combine teaching at college level with performing, the latter mostly done during the summer.

Being a professional musician necessitates that you understand and can run a small business, you also need to understand marketing and logistics.Being emotionally resilient and street smart. I think the modern music industry is often the worst fit for the types of people wanting to work in it. Most musicians are empathetic and caring and the music industry is by intention or fault designed to be cut throat and competitive. It\u2019s also shark infested waters with so many opportunities offering you fame and a chance at big money but really just eating all the pennies from musicians pockets.I\u2019ll add one more; being willing to work.

Should you slip, you can be a has-been in a year. Some have made a comeback, some haven\u2019t. Intense scrutiny of your personal life is a part of the package. As a musician at a lower intermediate level, the biggest problems I have encountered are logistical. Trying to find a parking place is a problem sometimes. Loading in can be a problem if there is a crowd when you get there. A big problem is trying to figure out how to set up a four or five piece band on a 3 foot by 3 foot stage. Sometimes you have to pay for parking, while the other employees do not. After all this, some club owners will try to screw you out of all or part of your pay. ",

Constantly facing the need to justify one\u2019s existence is very tiring, as is having to explain why what you do is worth \u2018X\u2019 dollars. Maintaining a performance level (i.e. practicing), including sight reading, improvising, and technical facility. Constant travel and being away from family. (The previous answer is even more difficult being away all the time). Keeping healthy, and eating properly when you\u2019re often not home. Looking after your hands when you have to carry heavy equipment. ",

While millions of those mindless copycat clones pretend to be artists only fool themselves and their peers, the truth is they are just fakes making a literal mockery of the art of music. ",
