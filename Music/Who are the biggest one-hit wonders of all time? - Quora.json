            "answer_text": "In selecting my Top 5 one hit wonders - here in the U.K., that is - I have gone back to the 1960s, which was the decade when I grew up. I have fond memories of all of the number one hit singles here, which were indeed one hit wonders in that the artist did not have any other records that entered even the Top 50 in the charts here in this country. Anyway, here they are :- Tell Laura I Love Her - Ricky Valance. Released on the Columbia record label, this reached number one on 29th September 1960 and stayed there for three weeks. I first heard this record when I was six years old and used to go over to my teenage cousin\u2019s house (next door to ours) and listen to this one on her record player.  About ten years later after she got married my cousin very generously gave to my sister and myself all of her record collection (which consisted of many hit singles between about 1959 and 1963). Ricky Valance was actually Welshman David Spencer, and he had obviously cribbed his recording name from Richie Valens, who died in the plane crash with Buddy Holly in February 1959. Fire - The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Released on the Track record label, this reached number one on 14th September 1968 and stayed there for one week. The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, headed by Arthur Wilton Brown (who came from Whitby on England\u2019s North Yorkshire coast) are still making records in 2019.  I recall seeing The Crazy World of Arthur Brown for the first time on BBC TV\u2019s \u201cTop of the Pops\u201d back in 1968, and there is a video of this unforgettable performance available on YouTube. In the Year 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)- Zager and Evans. Released on the RCA record label, this reached number one on 30th August 1969 and stayed there for three weeks, having been number one on Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the U.S, at the time of the Apollo 11 moon landings a few weeks earlier.  Zager and Evans are still the only artists ever to have a chart-topping number one hit on both sides of the Atlantic and never have another chart single in Billboard or in the UK for the rest of their career. The chilling theme of the song was how the advance of science and technology, far from helping the advance of civilisation, could well lead to its doom. Je T\u2019Aime\u2026 Moi Non Plus - Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. Released on the Major Minor record label, this reached number on 11th October 1969 and stayed there for one week. It was actually banned by the BBC, because of the vocal part of the record (if you\u2019ll pardon the expression) which seemed to a recording of sexual intimacy between the couple.  Instead of \u201cJe t\u2019Aime\u2026.Moi Non Plus\u201d the BBC instead played an instrumental version called \u201cLove At First Sight\u201d by Sounds Nice (featuring Tim Mycroft on the organ) which did reach the number 18 in the charts at around that time. Despite the BBC ban you could still listen to \u201cJe T\u2019Aime\u2026Moi Non Plus\u201d on the radio, by tuning in to Radio Luxembourg. Sugar Sugar - The Archies. Released on the RCA record label, this reached number one on 25th November 1969 and stayed there for eight weeks. I was quite surprised at this, because I thought it a fairly ordinary song. Nevertheless it stayed longer at number one than any other record in the British charts in the 1960s, though \u201cWonderful Land\u201d by Shadows was also at number one in the U.K. for eight weeks in 1962.  The other thing about \u201cSugar Sugar\u201d was of course that it was not actually performed by The Archies, because The Archies were only cartoon characters, and they are pictured on the record sleeve above.
