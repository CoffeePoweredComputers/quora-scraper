            "answer_text": "There are underlying similarities between Turkish and Greek music at a deeper level, and there are clear similarities between Greek pop and Turkish pop at a more proximate level. At a deeper level, the scales and instruments used by Turks and Greeks are related, through close to a millennium of coexistence. The tunings and modes of Byzantine chant have undergone microtonal influence from Turkish classical music. (The Greek chant preserved in Corsica does not have the same microtones.) Both the wind and the stringed instruments of the region have travelled in both directions. And of course the folk music of Christians and Muslims living in the same region was usually indistinguishable, whether it was Greece or Turkey. (Crete appears to have been an exception, but Christians took up the Muslim repertoire anyway after the Muslims left.) At a more proximate level, the pop tradition of Greek music started with Rebetiko, and Rebetiko itself is clearly rooted in Smyrneika (Ottoman caf\u00e9 music associated with Smyrna/\u0130zmir). The scales and style were clearly Ottoman in the 1920s, although they evolved in more Western directions in Greece, from the 1930s (the Piraeus style) on. Even before Rebetiko, there was a parallel outright Western pop tradition in Greek music, and the two traditions have mostly remained distinct; rebetiko has turned into La\u00efko (which in other answers I\u2019ve termed \u201cbouzouki pop\u201d), and Western operettas of the 1910s have given way to rock, R&B stylings, and Euro disco. Greeks are well aware that their Laiko tradition, and the revered Rebetiko that it comes from, has Turkish roots. Occasionally a nationalist might grouse about, but for the most part they\u2019re happy that they\u2019ve nativised it. It is worth noting that the Rebetiko that there is the most reverence for is not the Smyrneika of the 1920s, but the more nativised Peiraeus style of the 1930s. With the thaw in Greek\u2013Turkish relations since the 1990s, there has been a lot of traffic of \u201cserious\u201d musicians between the two countries; the Wikipedia article I linked to points out that contemporary performers of Rebetiko, if anything, overemphasise the Turkish style of the music. There has been some traffic of pop songs between the two countries, although that in itself is not remarkable; Arabic and Indian pop songs have also been covered in Greek. In discussion with Turks on Quora, I\u2019ve found that we understand each others\u2019 music, it is familiar to us\u2014but also that we would not mistake one\u2019s music for the other. One user (and I\u2019m annoyed I don\u2019t remember who: it was in a comment, so good luck searching it) offered to me that there was something more impassioned about Turkish music, and more fatalistic about Greek music (\u201cWhat can you do? Let\u2019s have an ouzo\u201d). That threw me, but then I realised that what came across to them as fatalistic comes across to me as stern and restrained: that was the contribution of the Piraeus style. ",

            "answer_text": "I've always considered music as part of the cultural continuum that changes gradually with geography. Communities that live close to each-other have similar tastes in arts, music and way of living. For example from a superficial youtube search on the Phrygian dominant scale I've noticed a musical continuum that starts in western Africa and the Iberic peninsula and goes as far as the Indian subcontinent. So to answer your question. Both countries are neighbours in a long cultural neighbourhood that doesn't start nor end in either of those two countries. ",
