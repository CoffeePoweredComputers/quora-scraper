            "answer_text": "Yes, of course it is. I have asked dozens of great scholars of Islam who have certified in Hadith, Fiqh, and Sunnah, and I have always received the same answer. For over a thousand years, there has never been a debate in Islam, as whether or not music is haram. Did you know that music was one of the first ins committed among the children of Adam? Did you know about the Hadith: \u201c Music grows hypocrisy in your heart, just as plantation grows with water.\u201d Or this Hadith: \u201cit will be from my Oumma men who will consider as Halal Al-Herra(Zinna), Al-hareer (Silk), Al-khamr(wines) and Ma-Azef (use of all kind of music or musical instruments) \u2026. Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so until the Day of Resurrection\". Or this one: \u201c In this Ummah there will be punishments of Khasf (earthquakes), Kazf (showers of stones) and Maskh (deformity or transformation into animals like khinzeer/pigs)\u2019 when the people will be involved in drinking, listening to female singers and playing musical instruments\u201d. Tabarani and Bayhaqi with good evidence also reported that the Prophet (pbuh) said that:\u201d some of the signs of the Day of Judgment are when: Al-Qayenat and singers (Muslims dancers, singers and famous stars), al-Ma-Azef (all kind of music), drinking alcoholic products and the use of silk products by men are made halal\". All of the Hadiths that I have presented are 100% authentic with full chain of narration. These are SAHIH Hadith from Bukhari, Tirmidhi, as well as Bayhaqi and Tabarani. So yes, I am sure that if you were to watch videos like Julio Iglesias\u2019s, it would definitely be sinful, if not Haram. And Allah knows best! ",
