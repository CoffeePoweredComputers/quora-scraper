            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s leave technique, etc out of this, because it\u2019s not really relevant. Well, it is, in as much as you need to actually be able to know how to play, but being a pro is about far, far more than that. This is what pros do that amateurs don\u2019t. They know the importance of networking. They go out there, watch bands, meet the band members, swap numbers and actually follow up with them. That way, if one of the musicians in their network finds themselves in need of a sub, or a new band member, or even a support band, the pro can make sure they\u2019re foremost in their minds.They know the importance of punctuality. Turn up on time. Always. And be ready.They know to learn the music. Whether it\u2019s originals or covers, if you show up prepared, then you\u2019re much more likely to get the gig. Write charts if necessary, but make sure you know the stuff.They know they have to look and act the part. As a live musician, you are an entertainer. You have to dress appropriately for the band and venue, you need to at least attempt to put on a show, and you need to look like a member of a band, not just some guy or girl with a bass, stuck at the back. Which brings me to the most important thing.They know they have to be a team player. You are joining a team. You need to be able to work and communicate well with others. You need to be able to \u2018hang\u2019, and you need to pull your weight. Your bandmates are people you will quite possibly be spending a lot of time with, often in less-than-ideal conditions, so be prepared.",

            "answer_text": "If you use the word \u2018professional\u2019 to describe quality of work, I think the key trait is the ability to fit right into (or create) the \u2018groove\u2019 in a song. Kind of hard to describe with words, the \u2018groove\u2019 is the feel of the rhythm players working together (like the guitar/drum/bass combo in Booker T\u2019s \u201cTime is Tight\u201d). It\u2019s either there or its not, and a pro bass player is a huge part of it. Another example is if the drummer or guitar player starts riffing with some new rhythm pattern, how quickly and smoothly does the bass player fit into it? Thats how you judge a pro.  smooth as butter, sweet as honey\u2026 ",
