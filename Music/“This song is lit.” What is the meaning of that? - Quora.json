            "answer_text": "The phrase \u201clit\u201d is part of the phrase \u201clit on fire\u201d. Previous generations used to describe something being great or best in its class as being \u201chot\u201d such as the \u201chot track of the week\u201d, heat is then related to fire so the term \u201con fire\u201d started to be used for anything that was doing very well.This was not only in music but sports or any performance in general. As with every generation, the millennials wanted to put their own slant on the term, and so they took the whole phrase \u201clit on fire\u201d and shortened it to just \u201clit\u201d. The phrase meaning remains the same but it allows a new generation to feel like they are different to the previous one. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "So music is usually recorded in physical form on paper in songbooks or just loose in a musician's posession. Paper music is useful for a lot of musicians who do not have the material memorized. When this paper music is ignited for some reason (on purpose or accidentally) the music can be referred to as \u201clit.\u201d Some people use English improperly so I'm happy to clarify. Your confusion is understandable ",
