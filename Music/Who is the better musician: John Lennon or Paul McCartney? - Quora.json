            "answer_text": "Being a Huge Die hard Beatles fan, and also of Lennon and McCartney\u2019s individual work (after the Break-up of the Beatles) I being more of a Lennon and his peace freedom music fan than McCartney\u2019s soulmate love driven music have to say that Paul McCartney was technically the better musician of the 2 (Note : A musician is someone in my opinion who more than just ONLY writing sensible great themed lyrics is able to add melody to it, play instruments by numbers, compose / write music NOT just words and lyrics of it) that being the definition Lennon clearly lacks for being a greater musician of the 2 despite having the advantage of being a bigger star / celebrity of the 2 (mainly because he (Lennon) founded the Beatles, released \u201c Imagine \u2019\u2019 which became by far the most famous post-Beatle member solo song (though both McCartney with his band Wings and Harrison had far more number one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts in the 1970s when compared to Lennon), an unexpected death of Lennon playing the major and crucial part of making Lennon the most famous of all the Beatles, Lennon with his wife Yoko Ono helding the whole Bed-In peace event in order to criticise the then Vietnam war which attracted worldwide media attention). McCartney was the driving force behind Beatles\u2019 and even the world\u2019s most covered song \u201c Yesterday \u2019\u2019, Beatles\u2019 most popular song \u201c Hey Jude \u2019\u2019, etc\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Lennon was NOT a multi-instrumentalist despite being able to play piano and guitar during his studio recording sessions or even in his live performances.Lennon DID NOT and NEVER composed the real Beethoven, Mozart level type music but he ONLY wrote lyrics of the song (more like on Bob Dylan level) But McCartney with fellow Beatles\u2019 record producer George Martin, composed the half of Live and Let Die (1970)\u2019s music and the songs on it.Lennon was a MUCH BETTER songwriter / lyricist of the 2 but McCartney was a MUCH SUPERIOR musician of the 2 due to McCartney being able to play countless musical instruments, reputation to perform an ENTIRE album by himself, ADDING MELODY to his music",

            "answer_text": "Paul. As simple as that. They both started as decent songwriters, and polished their acts until they both were writing amazing songs, I\u2019d say the Rubber Soul age. John\u2019s songs peaked at that time: Norwegian Wood, Girl and In My Life are not just some of the best Beatles songs, but some of the best popular songs ever (reaching back to the jazz era and forward to day). Actually if I was to base my judgment up to Rubber Soul exclusively, I could say John was the better musician. Then John (as well as George) got started on heavy drugs (LSD and maybe something else) while Paul stayed away for a little longer. As a result, John began mixing great songs with novelty crap. His talent never vanished completely but his self criticism did: by the time of the White Album he could still write amazing songs like Dear Prudence, Julia or Sexy Sadie, but mixed with mediocre stuff like Happiness is a Warm Gun, Bungalow Bill or Yer Blues, and utter pretentious crap like Revolution 9. Hemingway said that every writer should have a \u201cbuilt-in, shockproof shit detector\u201d: if John had one, it was killed by LSD. From then on John went mostly downhill. In 1975 (barely 5 years after the Beatles broke up) he released a greatest hits compilation album (Shaved Fish) and one of old rock covers (Rock And Roll). And then retired for five years, ostensibly to raise his son Sean, but with clear signals of his inspiration well having run dry. On the other hand, Paul\u2019s skills grew continuously. He did take drugs too, but either he was more careful or stronger, since he never lost his ability to filter out bad music. He got dangerously close in McCartney II, where he fell in love with early synth arpeggiators and voice filters, and released some pretty questionable crap. But overall, his musical production was always at least solid, when not brilliant. And then there\u2019s the drive to learn instruments and use other musicians. John was a good rhythm guitar player who could occasionally come up with a good solo, and that\u2019s all. Paul only played bass because the guitar positions were already filled: he was a very good guitarist from the start, he learned piano, and was always looking for ways to enhance the sound of the four-man band. Case in point: George Martin mentions when Paul heard a Baroque concert, was attracted to the sound of the early Baroque trumpet, and eventually gave it the famous Penny Lane solo. ",
