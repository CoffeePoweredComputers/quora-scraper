            "answer_text": "I am questioning some of the answers here. While I do not have experience with semi trucks, I do have tons of experience with 40+ foot diesel pusher RV\u2019s, which use the same air braking technology. I also have tons of experience with sports cars and high performance motorcycles for both racing and pleasure. In my experience, disk brakes stop better with less effort than drum brakes every time. Disk brakes dissipate heat better than drum brakes. They are also easier to service and maintain. They do not require adjustment. If drum were better performing, every sports car would have them but they gave them up many decades ago for much better performing disks. My father bought a new coach in 2004, his previous Monaco Signature series had air disk brakes all the way around, his newer Monaco Executive had them only on the front with air powered commercial drums on the drive and tag axles. Both coaches weigh within 5,000 pounds of each other and the difference in braking is noticeable. The one with disks all the way around had hands and feet better braking performance than the new one with only disks on the front. Even my 70\u2019s era motorhome has disks on the front. Disk brakes offer better mechanical advantage over drum. It is much easier to apply pressure squeezing pads from opposing sides on a center disk (think like using a pair of pliers on a flat piece of metal) versus pushing brake shoes out on the inside of a drum. It takes less effort to produce the same force. I am old enough to remember having drum brakes on the front of personal cars. When one would get out of adjustment, which was common, it was downright dangerous to drive. Hit the brakes hard and it would yank the steering wheel out of your hands. I would never go back. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the thing about disc brakes: A friction brake (disc, drum, whatever) works by converting rotational motion into heat energy - or, in common terms, you step on the brakes and they get hot. When your brakes cool off, you get your full stopping power back. If you want great and consistent stopping power, you need to do one of two things: build brakes that cool off faster, or put a lot more metal in them so it takes more effort to heat-soak them. A car doesn\u2019t have room to make drum brakes bigger, so they use brakes that cool off faster - disc brakes. Look at the high-performance brakes they put on sports cars: they started with ventilated discs, then went to drilled discs and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if in a few years they figured out how to put dual discs on a car wheel. (It\u2019s already done on motorcycle front wheels.) Heavy-duty trucks have all the room they need, so they put really wide brake shoes and super-deep drums on the drive axles. The steer axle is a different story: Kenworths and Peterbilts all come with front discs; they\u2019re available on other brands at an upcharge. Given all that, there is one group of truckers who LOVE disc brakes: garbage truck drivers. Garbage trucks start and stop so frequently they don\u2019t get the chance for drum brakes to cool. Discs cool quicker, so on a garbage truck they\u2019re better. ",
