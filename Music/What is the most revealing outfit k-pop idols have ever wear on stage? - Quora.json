A solo artist called Seo Inyoung wore this  Stellar - a group known for their sexy concept had very revealing outfits. It\u2019s sad really because later it was revealed how they weren\u2019t at all comfortable with their concept yet they were forced to do it.    Dal Shabet wore these outfits for one of their comebacks.  Momoland had extremely revealing stage outfits for their comeback \u2018Bboom Bboom\u2019 which consisted of really small shorts. And they weren\u2019t even given safety shorts.  Do you guys remember Hello Venus? And their famous song \u2018Wiggle Wiggle\u2019. Basically it was a song were they twerked a lot so obviously, there would be revealing stage outfits.  Sistar, our summer queen, had a fair share of revealing outfits. But a memorable one was their outfits for \u2018So Cool\u2019 during KBS\u2019s Music Festival. I\u2019m suprised KBS didn\u2019t censor the video.  There\u2019s a group called Bambino who had a sexy concept, sorta. And when performing one of their songs, a member- Hadom- wore really short shorts and didn\u2019t wear safety shorts underneath.    Laysha, a kpop group who had very very revealing outfits.   It\u2019s really sad to see all these groups to be sexualised so much by giving them barely any clothes to perform in. They must have felt so uncomfortable. I\u2019m aware I haven\u2019t included any boy groups and there are many other groups/idols who have worn very revealing outfits on stage but I think this is enough for now. 15 Extremely Revealing Stage Outfits That Were Almost Banned sayonara~k.l ",

            "answer_text": "I feel like most girl groups go through at least one stage/performance where their outfits consists of crop top + shorts or miniskirt. Regardless of if they\u2019re a sexy or cute group: Sistar  EXID  I.O.I  Gfriend  And for broadcast stages, that\u2019s about as revealing as they can get without censorship issues. The most revealing outfit worn on a broadcasted stage by an idol that I can think of is Sistar\u2019s Dasom when she wore this during their Insane Love/I Like That showcase.  \u2014Though not an Idol, Jessi (who\u2019s known to be someone unafraid to show off her body) once wore this outfit to a festival performance   ",
