            "answer_text": "The operating system is probably the biggest advantage. Since Macs are now Intel-based the hardware isn't much of an exclusivity issue. You can buy or build a PC with comparable parts for cheaper, but there can be some inherent problems with functionality. Also, Final Cut Pro runs on a Mac, so if you're planning on being an editor, that's one advantage right there. If you're building a PC, you'd have to take it a step further and build what's called a Hackintosh, which relies on certain parts for ease of use. Ultimately, the processor, RAM and, to a lesser extent, hard drive is what will make your editing smoother, regardless of the platform you use. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a bit vague, but I\u2019ll do my best to give a brief answer. I\u2019ve used both, and have come to highly favor Mac - for editing purposes. I find Final Cut Pro to be the fastest pro quality editor I\u2019ve used, as it is quite user friendly. PC is much cheaper to build to higher specs, and is therefore better for a budget editing platform, and for render farms. Mac can run almost any editing software that PC will run, but not the other way around. If you\u2019re an amateur to professional video producer, I\u2019d recommend a Mac. If you do a lot of motion graphics, animation or 3D, I\u2019d recommend PC. Hope that helps :) ",
