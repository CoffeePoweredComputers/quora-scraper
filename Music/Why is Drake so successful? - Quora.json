            "answer_text": "A confluence of factors:  His role as an actor on Degrassi, which gave him some credibility with \"mainstream\" listeners, deep cash reserves to finance his lifestyle and early music career and also a lot of free publicity and buzz due to the curiosity of an actor becoming a rapper.Good looks.Releasing his early mixtapes for free online, at a time when mixtapes were just blowing up, which created a lot of buzz for him, for free.Early mentorship by and help from Lil Wayne, just as Weezy's career blew up. Drake drafted off of Weezy in a big way and capitalized well on the halo of success around Wayne the past few years.Getting signed to Young Money, and thereafter getting a huge push from Lil Wayne, Young Jeezy and other established acts, including through some excellent collaborations (I really enjoy the stuff he has done with Lil Wayne).Focusing more on R&B than rapping; along with the good looks thing, this has turned him into a next generation R&B heartthrob, where he wouldn't have the street cred to be a pure rapper because of his background (e.g., he went to high school in a wealthy town in Canada).A close personal connection with Trey Songz, which gave Drake mainstream exposure and credibility within a community he had no previous affiliation with.The production of Noah \"40\" Shebib, who almost single-handedly created the sound that caught the ear of Trey Songz and the Lil Wayne camp.Hat-tip to Milan Gokhale for the last two points. As with most things, his success has been a combination of natural qualities, good timing, seizing opportunities and very good PR. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few reasons. First of all, Drake is very good at making connections with the right people. If you want to be a pop star, this is a vital skill. While acting in the Canadian TV series Degrassi: The Next Generation, Drake produced several mixtapes, the first of which featured Lupe Fiasco, one of the hottest names in the underground at the time, and Trey Songz, already a decently well-known pop singer. These mixtapes built up enough hype to start a bidding war for his services; he ended up signing with Young Money records, a very wise move, as Lil Wayne, head of Young Money, was the most dominant rapper on the charts at the time. Second, Drake came with a very unique sound and stage persona. We\u2019d never really seen a true rapper/pop singer hybrid at that point, and the idea had massive marketing potential. Enter Drake, who was part rapper, part pop singer, and his subdued style of rapping and smooth vocals overtop his more subdued, moody beats made for a unique combination that hadn\u2019t been anyone\u2019s signature sound in the mainstream yet. Love him or hate him, you can\u2019t really deny Drake these two things. When the trap craze exploded a few years back, rather than resist, Drake embraced it, and his vocal style was a good fit. He began collaborating a little less with his peers in Young Money and a little more with some of the biggest names in trap, most notably Future, probably the subgenre\u2019s biggest name. In short, Drake became successful because he filled a unique niche in rap and pop that hadn\u2019t yet been filled, and has stayed successful because he\u2019s continually worked with the right people.
