            "answer_text": "To quote Louis Armstrong, \"All music is folk music.  I ain't never heard a horse sing a song\" In America, it's semantics -- what one person means when he says 'folk music' isn't always the same thing, let alone what two different people mean when they use the word. The term 'Folk music' originally meant the music of the common people -- that which was passed down primarily by shared tradition, kind of the musical tradition of folk tales and folk remedies.  In other words, oral tradition.  What happened was in the 60's (and even prior to that) publishers and song writers and record producers discovered that there was a market for some of that music.  The change in the definition, largely was a result of marketing.  But you have a problem there, because the term 'folk music' was MEANT to mean music passed down as part of an oral tradition, but once you had artists recording it, selling it to the general public, it became part of the NON-folk tradition.  Clearly, the definition had to change. So Folk. more and more, came to mean'folk-style' -- music in the STYLE of folk music.  The traditional definition had more to do with how the music originated and was passed on, than it had to do with an actual style.  And clearly American folk music and Russian folk music and Irish Folk Music, and Native American folk music, and so on, don't necessarily share anything MUSICALLY in common with each other.  What the marketing people were more interested in was selling records, rather than creating a coherent category.  Any artist who sang folk songs -- the songs that they actually did write themselves, became labeled as folk music.  If you liked Peter, Paul and Mary singing traditional folk songs, you probably could sell there original music as well under the same label.  \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\", clearly is not a traditional folk song, nor is \"Puff the Magic Dragon\".  But it could be sold as folk music to fans of the group. ",

            "answer_text": "A very good question, because it confuses many. So\u2026a simple explanation would be as follows. Tradition Folk music has no known author. Modern folk music has a known composer, usually holding a copyright. That's the short answer. Songs such as Barbara Ellen, Lord Randall, the Water is Wide or instrumental pieces such as the Irish Washer Woman or Angeline the Baker are hundreds of years old. There was no mass media and illiteracy was the norm. Education was just for the wealthy, so these songs were passed down from person to person in the oral tradition as a means of passing on their culture and stories. Do you recall an exercise referred to as telephone, where one person whispers a short statement to another, who then does the same down the line? After ten or twelve people relay the message in this manner, the last person and first person in the group compare the statement. Invariably, they are not the same, and often wildly different. Now think of a musical game of telephone. Songs and music in one isolated community undergo some minor changes from person to person in one generation to the next. Relatively speaking those changes were minor. When the music passes from one community to another, and then another, some interesting changes occur. The melody may change from a major key to a minor key. The tempo may change. In a time where ballads were defined as songs with story lines, rather than as just love songs (as a ballad is thought of today), characters in a song might be added or omitted, and oftentimes verses as well. The same melody might be used for multiple songs. Many of those same songs and instrumental tunes crossed the Atlantic from the old world to the new. Yes\u2026even more separation from the original source created more change in not just the music, but the instruments used as well, creating even more regional variations in storylines and melodies. This manner of change is referred to as the Folk process. You will find written versions of these songs and tunes credited as Traditional or Anonymous. Indeed, the act of writing musical notation of the material itself is relatively modern. And often when the people, on both continents, learned that the music they passed on to scholars had been written down on paper, they were disturbed or offended by the fact. Much like cultures who considered being photographed as stealing part of their souls, to many practitioners of traditional music, the capturing of the material on paper was viewed as stealing some of it's magic. So much for summarizing traditional folk music. The term folk music today covers both those who perform traditional music and original music. Often in tone and tenor it resembles traditional styles, but not always. Now we know who wrote and owns the copyrights to the music. Many singer-songwriters of the 50s and 60s wrote original music that was firmly rooted in the old styles, but gradually the subject matter drifted into political and social lyrics. Regional styles diminished to a large degree due to mass media. Ballads gave way to more personal story telling. But as to melodies or storylines, the pace of change was nearly eliminated. A person living in Tennessee and a person in Timbuktu can hear the same recorded version of any piece of music. Some change is still inevitable, but to a much lesser degree. Once the domain of acoustic instruments, electric instruments were introduced to the mix, at first to some consideral amount of controversy. A good example would be Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival. Today, it's quite common to hear either or both. So that's the difference, right? Oh wait. There is still, as always, a grey area. Some songs, such as Woody Guthrie's \u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d, are becoming so well known that some look at it as, well, nearly traditional. Songs by Leadbelly such as \u201cGoodnight Irene\u201d or \u201cKisses Sweeter Than Wine\u201d fall into this category as well. The latter song is a rare example of modern folk music that has undergone some melodic change as well. Alan Lomax made field recordings of traditional music all over the US, exposing much of this music and the musicians we know of today. He discovered and recorded Leadbelly's songs. Unlike Woody Guthrie, who owned his own copyrights, and even though his contribution was important, Lomax took some undue credit for Leadbelly's songs as co-author and owned the copyright, as well. The end result of all this is that we are graced with wonderful performers of both traditional and modern/original folk music. Doc Watson performed traditional music and original songs in a beautiful and skilled manner, but only wrote a few of his own compositions, as did Joan Baez. Jean Ritchie wrote a great amount of songs that sound to most ears as very traditional. Bob Dylan, John Prine, Steve Earl, Joni Mitchell, Gordan Lightfoot, Richie Havens, Townes Van Zandt and so many other folk artists began to have their feet planted both in traditional and modern folk music, with an added dose of Country and Rock 'n Roll music as well. Today's musicians, such as Gillian Welch, Fred Eaglesmith, Sarah Jarosz, the Duhks, Garnet Rogers, Peter Mulvey, Lula Wiles, Patty Griffin, Rhiannon Giddens carry it on. Today, most of us grew up listening to pop music and discovered folk music later in life and dove into it whole heartedly. I am such a person. And that's as traditional as, well, apple pie. ",
