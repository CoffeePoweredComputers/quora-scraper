To give you a better insight they generally release the NPAT scorecard within maximum 20 days of the test conducted. For instance in 2017, tests were scheduled on 14th & 15th May. The results were declared on 1st June. You will receive the result in your registered email as well as a message will be delivered to the registered phone number.
