Worth your time) 5.Phantom(I absolutely have no idea why it didnt performed well,we can say that it is just a movie if we could do that in real it would be better. Well yaa agreed. But atleast it has showed what could we do and what we are capable of. And the song Saware is just too good) 6.Anjaana Anjaani(from story to music to location to spontaneity it has everything,A complete light afternoon pick,music is also really good. Many of us still listen Aas paas khuda) 7.Rocky handsome(Despite not doing well at box office,the quality of action in that movie is second to none. I dont watch hollywood but many who watch said its close to that) 8.Gabbar(This is surely a good watch. Sunil grover nails it ) That was my list,some people are saying Tamasha as well but I haven\u2019t watched so cant comment on that. EDIT 1: 9.Table no. 21(How can I miss that,this is what according to me deserve oscar,absolutely outstanding,won\u2019t let you blink your eye for 2 hours ",
