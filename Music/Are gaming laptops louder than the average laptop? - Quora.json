            "answer_text": "Before I abswer, I want to say that no gaming laptops are equal; this is only my own experience. Yours may differ. My personal laptop is the Lenovo Legion Y520. When I'm not doing anything intense, the machine is extremely quiet. But when I start playing a game, the fans pick up a bit. However, it still doesn't get very loud. At least, not until I turn on Extreme Cooling.  Extreme Cooling overdrives the fans to their maximum speed. It makes the machine pretty loud, but offers better performance because the graphics card is able to stay cool. With Extreme Cooling off, the fans limit themselves for the sake of being quieter. Here's the fans on my machine:  Yes, there's dust all over the vents. I should definitely clean that off now. I will say though, that the noise of these fans is NOTHING compared to some\u2026 older laptops. ",

            "answer_text": "Average gaming laptop(now it\u2019s ~gtx 1060m) is not louder than average laptop. All of them are usually louder than 2-in-1/ultrabooks The reason is simple - price and quality under the hood, most gaming laptops have better layout of heatpipes, with better (quieter at the same airflow) fans. On average laptop, there is no incentive to insert quieter cooling system. Of course when you look at the most powerfull options available, they will be louder, but on average you won\u2019t hear more noise from them. I\u2019ve tried some laptops recently(still looking for the best-est) and checked a lot of data - apart from really resource-taxing activities like GTA 5 or Witcher 3(which, let\u2019s be honest, you couldn\u2019trun on average laptop), normal work is as quiet as on average laptop with integrated GPU.

            "answer_text": "Under load (e.g. when running games), definitely. Some of them get very noisy to the point you need headphones to hear anything coming out of the computer. Others are not so much so, but still loud. While idle or doing light tasks like browsing or watching videos, it depends on what you mean by the \u2018average laptop.\u2019 They\u2019re still going to be louder than fanless low power designs, but compared to a typical mainstream laptop with fans they are about the same.
