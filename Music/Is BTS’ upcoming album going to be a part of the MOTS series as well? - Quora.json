            "answer_text": "[Edit]: Unfortunately, my timing was so freaking bad. I was going to post this yesterday, BUT of course BigHit announced BTS\u2019s new album JUST when I wanted to predict what the new album would be about. Just read this answer as if you never found out about BTS\u2019s \u201cBe\u201d album hehe. I did intend to post this yesterday, but apparently my luck is just so bad! But, I mean, my answer was PRETTY spot on and I did predict many things that would be in the album, so\u2026.. props to me I guess\u2026.? Still mad that I was late though\u2026 I actually can\u2019t believe the timing was so bad\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude02 Anyways, here\u2019s the answer that WAS SUPPOSED to be written and posted yesterday, but didn\u2019t happen because BigHit decided to just ruin my timing because of their announcement of BTS\u2019s new album, \u201cBe.\u201d I worked too hard on it and I\u2019m not letting it go, so yeah\u2026 still posting it hehe oops\u2026.. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a  No, I don\u2019t think so. The Map of the Soul journey should have ended with the Japanese album that was released earlier this year\u2014correct me if I\u2019m wrong though. Either way, I\u2019m going to discuss why I believe the MOTS journey is over and what this new album could be about.  To start, I want to just say that I have a feeling this new album will have to do with the next 7 years and the idea of starting fresh for the next few years. Before I jump into the conclusions, I just want to show you chronologically what I mean. What this new album is about should be something completely different. It was not actually planned beforehand because remember, BTS was supposed to go on a world tour for most of this year. It was supposed to be this big thing (7 year anniversary), but because of Covid, the entire plan BTS had was put on a hold. With that being said, BTS had to step back and put everything on pause\u2026 just like the rest of the world. They had a lot of time on their own. Each of the members went off on their own for a while before regrouping. When they came together, this was when the idea of Dynamite came into the equation. It was a song they came across that they really wanted to do. Now that they\u2019re done with this single, they\u2019re moving on to a new album, but remember all of these new projects were essentially \u201clast minute\u201d ideas since they had so much time on their hands now. So, with all of this being said, I don\u2019t think this new album will be a part of the MOTS journey as it was never intentionally supposed to be a thing until Covid came around. The new BTS album coming out was really only a secondary option for now because of quarantine and all this free time each of the BTS members had on their hands. Not to mention, Jimin has revealed that this new album will be quite different with many different genres of music and such. I don\u2019t think the meaning behind this new album will have anything to do with their MOTS journey just because the MOTS 7 album was the finale of their journey for those past seven years. Now, BTS is starting off fresh and with that comes a new story to it. Now, it\u2019s a new decade and I\u2019m hinting that this new album will have to do with re-starting and starting fresh for these next few years. I actually have a theory for this new album. Essentially, I believe it will have a lot to do with the pandemic and living on and not letting these dark times affect us. BTS loves to have meaningful stories behind their music and it just makes sense that it would be about the pandemic and how the entire world was affected.  Not to mention, every since this new album was revealed to be a thing, each of the videos on Bangtan\u2019s youtube channel\u2014that related to this new album\u2014had the hastags,#StayConnected #CarryOn linked to the videos. There has to be some kind of connection there. The videos that didn\u2019t have to do with this new album weren\u2019t linked with those hashtags, and the videos that did have to do with this new album were linked with these hashtags: #StayConnected #CarryOn. To me, I feel like maybe their new album is either titled something similar to these hashtags or at least have to do with \u201cmoving forward\u201d and \u201cstaying connected.\u201d In addition, I\u2019ve noticed that Bangtan has posted quite a few sit down videos that were livestreamed\u2014of the BTS boys. In a recent video, they talked about the new album and a concept of a music video for one of these new songs in the album. It was all about coronavirus and how the pandemic has affected everyone\u2014including them. This new video is going to have components of the BTS members having an online concert without an audience, the sadness to it, what life looks like in quarantine, and finally, memories back to when BTS was on tour and when life was normal.  You can watch the video above to get more details! Anyways, these are just my thoughts on the new album. If I were to bet on anything, it would be that this new album has to do with the pandemic and how everyone was affected. The message, I predict, may be about moving on and trying to live life fully even when you\u2019re affected by this global pandemic. All of these clues just make me think that it will be along these lines. Well, what do you think? Leave your comments down below!! Stay safe everyone!\ud83d\udc9c ~Luke ",
