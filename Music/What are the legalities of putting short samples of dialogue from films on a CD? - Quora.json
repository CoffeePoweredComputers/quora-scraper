Otherwise you\u2019re best to ask permission from the copyright owners. I\u2019ve done it, you might be surprised how often they say yes. ",

This would be one hell of a lawsuit which you could not win. Be aware: movie trivia games that use quotes get a license to do this from the distributors of the film. They have permission, which is the only way to do this legally. ",
