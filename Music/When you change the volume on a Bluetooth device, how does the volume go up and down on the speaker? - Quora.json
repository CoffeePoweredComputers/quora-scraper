            "answer_text": "Computer or similar chips send a command to a VCA, voltage controlled amp, or it may do this with digital codes. A small digital number or low voltage gives low volume out, high number or high voltage high volume. Today the portable Bluetooth speakers have their own volume control buttons which control their own little computer and amp. Or you can use the similar circuitry on your phone to send a softer or louder sound to the speaker. ",
