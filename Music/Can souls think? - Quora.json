            "answer_text": "Great question, but we should ask whether one can think without a brain. A soul cannot think, they follow the instincts and patterns learned from a physical life. We incarnate to challenge old instincts, and to assess new belief systems. In the end advanced souls follow the stream of chi that is purely divine, unconditional love and this becomes the instinct and wisdom. In this state, an enlightened spirit can listen and flow with divine awareness, never needing after this point to think without guidance, but become guidance. Angels do not think, they are extensions to divine essence, they follow divine law without question, and they can hear requests and act according to the principles of divine law. No thought. Humans being so primitive have yet to comprehend a state of being when all is known, all options assessed, and results embraced in a single moment, though some psychics can not only advise, see the possible futures and advise on a preferred course of actions. And so we incarnate with a brain until we can feel the way without it, then we cease our incarnations. ",

            "answer_text": "Science hasn't been able to explain how living, sentient beings like humans think. What is a thought? How does a brain that is proven to follow all known laws of physics generate something like thoughts that do not have a physical existence? These are the questions that scientists are still grappling with. In fact, consciousness, which is nothing but a stream of thoughts, is one of the hard problems that scientists and philosophers have been fruitlessly pondering for centuries. With such being the case for us humans who have a physical body, I don't think a soul, which is mostly a metaphysical concept rather than a physical reality, has any luck. So, if you ask science \u201cCan souls think?\u201d, the answer would be \u201cIt's undefined since the subject of your interest, the soul, is undefined or unprovable\u201d. PS: I'm sorry if you were looking for a religious answer. Since I saw the question was tagged under spirituality, which doesn't preclude scientific enquiry, I've given an answer from a scientific standpoint. ",

            "answer_text": "Besides the fact that no one can provide proof for their opinion on the matter, the question couldn\u2019t really be answered without first defining what you think soul is\u2026 because frankly, different cultures use the word soul to refer to different things. From my own perspective, which is a nondual perspective influenced by eastern philosophy, soul has nothing to do with any discrete characteristics, let alone thought. In the nondual view, soul is equated with existence or being, which is a very generalized principle. However, that generalized principle serves as a basis for particularized minds\u2026 and minds do think. Likewise, one could ask if the body thinks, and the answer would be that the body as a general entity does not think, but as the substratum in which a brain exists, it provides the necessary condition for thought to occur.

            "answer_text": "In normal cases a soul never think ,it just indicate that he is available but when you know that one power ruined your life. For example ,a man is in dipression his mind is struggling ,he is doing everything ,taking medicine ,working then which energy is stooping him. Actually all the universe is energy ,if we just speak past science . You can not make a singles products without using five energy 1 earth 2 water 3 fire 4 air 5 sky .only sixth energy our soul has no material of this universe. otherwise wise our mind which feel ,because of soul. Soul can enter in anything .for example. We are findings how we came on earth.first time milk convert curd ,but for curd ,milk needs bacria ,bactria need body ,so our soul live in sky ,sky has some parts of earth ,so may be chemicals reaction in sky with this energy. This energy can cross any palace ,just like air but this energy can go any where in universe. no products can Stop it.same you can not live a parrot in cadge ,he want to free,but some person make fool to parrot and live in cadge ,and don't go any where. This is my believe system ,so it has no value ,but till then a judge don't know what is fact what is false .he use his concentration power.and always be concious in mind live suspect in mind again both side people. So if anyone want to know that soul is available or not just change its name in mind just like a energy because all the current holy people misused this energy. You believe and you know about will power because of this power otherwise will power has also no evidence. When some holy person feel that we are not a body ,we are soul ,he change all the internal system ,and cantrol the will power which just create wishes.like yogi is just controlling currupt people who just think for bribe.

            "answer_text": "We are a soul experiencing in a body and not a body with a soul. We need the brains to think in the events of our daily experience thru the body, but our fundamental thoughts come from our soul: If you suffer an accident and hit your head badly but keep you alive and without using any support device, you might not be able to talk or even move but your most fundamental functions will continue to work Otherwise you would die. I speak of respiratory systems, digestive, circulatory, cellular, etc. The soul is what keeps us alive and being alive means that you will live your life in a normal way, doing things and choosing experiences. So in the example above if a certain time passes and health is not recovered then the soul is released with death and in case the body were forced to live connected to devices of artificial life, then life will be that artificial, because the soul will have abandoned the body. The soul can remember all events lived through the body as our subconscious mind, but adaptable and able to experiment with any different type of body or machine and can also live without the need of any body and in other dimensions and realities. So, Yes Souls Think Another question would be : why we forgot where we come from and who we really are? For next\u2026 ",

Soul is an abstraction, it's identity unknown, imaginary and full of skeptical theory with little or no truth backing it. Various types of Energy , matter interacts with each other all the time, but uncertainty rules as nothing determinant can be quantified about how it will do so. We as humans, have evolved to think too survive, to feed, to reproduce and keep ourselves safe and adapt as per need. Soul's purpose, identity, motive, objective, existence,etc are all disputed. This nothing definite can be started what soul is our is purpose or functioning. Science doesn't investigate in mythical concepts. Hypothesis are helpful in science to reach at a conclusion. But soul is just a word, we don't even know what we are referring with that name. It's the human easy of thinking, we generalise things to understand them better. We create an the confusion and the clarity inside ourselves. ",

Thought is something that should be used to maintain energy efficiency all other thinking organisms manage this, humans have an evolutional brain fault that can reduce energy efficiency as anxiety and the resulting negative/harmful thought and action is produced. Until humans recognise the fault in self and work to repair it rather than just recognise the symptoms in others we will continue to waste energy on anxiety based thought. ",
