            "answer_text": "No, but you should understand that this obssession will kill you. Like mentally, you will die. Most Taekookers ship it because they don\u2019t understand what harm their obssession is doing to the community around them and for that I wrote something. I\u2019ll try to share it here. Noor Kareem's post in ARMY Room \u1d2e\u1d31 \u2077 Sometimes, all you need to hear is a harsh scolding from someone to straighten yourself out! Srsly, there was a time when I was absolutely obssessed with a kpop ship (not gonna say which) but I was gradually able to let go of it as I matured, which I hope you will too. I\u2019m happy that you did not aim your question in a toxic way though, so fighting! Fight yourself! This isn\u2019t just harming everybody around you but rightnow you are your biggest enemy. Obssession with anything is fatal. ARMY, fighting! ",
