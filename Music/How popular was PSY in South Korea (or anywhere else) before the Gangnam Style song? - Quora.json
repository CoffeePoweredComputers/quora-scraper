            "answer_text": "Psy was certainly well-known in his native Korea.  In the years leading up to his Gangnam style break out, Psy was known as a maverick.  Most K-pop acts are heavily manufactured / carefully managed acts held to extremely restrictive standards of public conduct.    Psy defied this norm.  According to Jae-Ha Kim of Tribune services: \"He\u2019s not squeaky clean like a lot of the guys in K-pop bands. He was busted for pot, and he was outed for trying to get out of serving mandatory military duty, which caused a huge stink in Korea. But he knows how to rap and he just oozes attitude. There\u2019s a reason why 30,000 fans show up at his concerts in Korea. I honestly can\u2019t think of anyone in the U.S. who\u2019s like him.\" Oozes attitude.  That's about right! By the way, check out some earlier Psy. This video makes you want to root for South Korea even if you're not Korean.    And any cube denizen can sympathise with the predicament illustrated here.  This song, RIght Now, hit #4 on the Korean charts in 2010.   sources:   http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/08/28/gangnam-style-viral-popularity-in-u-s-has-koreans-puzzled-gratified/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psy_(rapper) ",
