            "answer_text": "Just like beauty, a passion and love for music really comes from the person\u2019s own tastes. For me, I\u2019m a rocker and a metalhead: I love the emotion that is put into writing the music. I\u2019m going to use my favourite band; Nothing More, as an example One of my favourite songs by them is This Is The Time (Ballast). The song\u2019s lyrics basically represent having grudges against someone and learning to let them go. It\u2019s a very poetic song that highlights how amazing Johnny Hawkins (vocals) is at writing music. The bass in the song is kickass: thumping and ominous, rising above the guitars and the drums as the highlight to the song, especially in the acoustic version I\u2019ll Be Ok encompasses everything I love about lyrics. It\u2019s soulful, heartfelt, powerful. It showcases heartbreak, grief, sorrow and pain, then learning to find solace and rise again. It\u2019s one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever heard. The instruments are just as amazing as Johnny\u2019s voice. The drums are slow, not hit particularly hard and vicious, just there, in the rhythm, keeping the time. The guitar is just as slow, but the strums give the song just that added heart and emotion. In short, for me, a good song needs a meaning. It needs an appealing sound. A meh song is a song that I like for its beat but can\u2019t connect with it. A good song goes past that with some relatable lyrics. A truly memorable song is one you get stuck in your head, and you never forget. I almost cry listening to I\u2019ll Be Ok. Give Nothing More a spin, you won\u2019t regret it ",

            "answer_text": "Good song is many things. It is music that is touching and moving, music that influences my emotions, whether the song makes me want to cry or punch someone in the face, it must be meaningful. Good song must have good lyrics, that is the first thing, all that you hear these days, \u201cUm I screwed some chick and then got high\u201d this is not art, therefore I do not consider this as music. Most songs that are pop and rap and hiphop, excluding Eminem\u2019s occasionally touching songs, have no meaning what so ever. Music can not just be about sex, drugs, violence, beer, and partying. Good music must have a good beat, also the singer must have a good voice but if the lyrics are deep and meaningful, its all good. Pink Floyd and Porcupine Tree are the bands that, for me, have proven to be education. Every beat, every single word in their songs have a meaning. We need to decipher it. :) ",
