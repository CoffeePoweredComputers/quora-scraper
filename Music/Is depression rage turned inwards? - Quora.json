            "answer_text": "It could be and it couldn't, it depends on the nature of the person whether the person is an introvert or extrovert. First of almost all introvert burn down their anger inwardly and as a result based on the environment or family background the thoughts takes time to wear off their mind. With this some introvert can suffer depression due inward angers since they barely trust anyone to tell it too. But some of them have some sarcastic trait which allow them spill out these angers (most times awkwardly) and allow them to be at peace again and happy. For extroverts, as we all know, they enjoy meeting people and having lots of friends, if they develop an unsettled fight with their close buddies. Due to not being able to associate with them with love and enthusiasm any more the inward angers can also make them depressed. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the oldest and most influential school of thought in psychology i.e., Psychodynamic, depression is said to be a result of anger towards others being turned inward or towards self. Yet, this is not the only cause of depression. Nonetheless, it can also be an etiology of depression. Different branches of psychology give different opinions regarding the causes of depression. For example, Cognitive school of thought believes depression is the result of wrong thinking pattern or cognitive distortion and Existentialism would say depression is the result of meaninglessness in a person's life. And they are indeed supported or backed up by researches. To sum up, rage turned inward can cause depression but depression can also take root from other sources such such stress, disrupted sleep pattern etc. ",
