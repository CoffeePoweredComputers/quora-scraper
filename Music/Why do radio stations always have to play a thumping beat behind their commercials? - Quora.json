            "answer_text": "There are a few possible explanations: Assuming that the commercials were produced by the station and not an advertising agency, the station\u2019s management might have felt that the thumping beat is a good fit to the radio station\u2019s format. This would more likely be the case with a station that programs contemporary hit music than it would be with one that programs talk radio or classic rock.The client may have requested that the background music be used. Car dealership commercials, for instance, often seem to go over-the-top with gimmicks to gain attention.In the vast majority of music formats, there has long been the conventional wisdom that something must play underneath the announcer\u2019s voice. This is why DJs talk over the intros of songs, and it is also why a music bed is almost always used in commercials, as well as weather and traffic updates.If the station produced the commercial, then that station purchased a production music package. Radio stations do not have the budget to hire composers and musicians to create music beds for them. Perhaps, most or all of the tracks in the station\u2019s production music library were created for \u201crhythmic\u201d formats (ones that cater to dance music, hip-hop, or R&B).",

            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t! I\u2019ve written, voiced and produced over 3,000 radio commercials in my career and I use whatever music and sound effects I feel will help sell the clients product or services. Since I retired I still listen to the commercials and rarely hear any commercials with a thumping beat in the background. Stations never air a commercial without first playing it for the client so corrections or changes can be made. If a client thought the background music was not appropriate they would tell the station to change it. ",
