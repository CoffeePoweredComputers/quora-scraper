            "answer_text": "First of all I'm going to give you some practice tips, then I will let you in on a little secret... A some of the other answers point make clear, there are several ways you can practice this. The bar chord is a troublesome chord for all beginning guitarists. It requires some strength in your index finger. So start with that. But let's forget the F for the moment. Let's start on the fifth fret and play an A chord. It'll be a little easier. Pick out each note and try to get it to ring clearly. Move up and down the fretboard like this. Do this little and often, 5 minutes every day, for as long as it takes. Then start adding your other fingers, start with the ring finger (to make Am7), then, your little finger (Am) and finally your middle finger (A) and so the same for each one; make all of them ring individually. This is like push-ups for the fingers. Now, for the secret. For most chords you'll be using your thumb on the back of the guitar neck to apply counter pressure, allowing you to press on the strings with your fingers. Playing an F-shape chord like this will have your hand pretty tightly squeezing. Release the thumb and what happens, the strings doesn't ring out because you can't push in the strings, right? Well, let's get some counter pressure from elsewhere... The arm, for instance, is much stronger than the thumb. So how about pulling your whole arm towards you, just a little, with your fingers in the F-shape on the neck. This effectively does the same job as the thumb.  Don't pull too hard or you'll cause the pitch of the notes to become sharp. The trick is to find just enough pressure to allow you to easily make the chord. I hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "To really get any chord under your fingers comfortably and play them without thinking about them you have to be comfortable changing chords; as mentioned, this is the beginning of learning barre chords. If you want to learn to really play the F, practice it in a Key whose chord changes are all barre chords, this is a lot simpler than it sounds than a beginner just starting barre chords might think. It actually massively simplifies things for very common repetitive chord changes, I actually have to think a lot harder when I'm intentionally playing all open chords (no barres) at the nut. You can get a heck of a lot out of just two basic shapes, if your already working on the F barre chord go look up the Bb chord shape, that's the match to the F chord, except your moving every note up one string (up in pitch as in higher, not \"up\" across the fret board. As said in another answer, this is easier to do higher up the neck, it require less pressure in the middle of the strings (theoretically, if you have access, the 11th fret Eb would be the position requiring the least force, if you are young and have small hands it helps too as there is less of a stretch required because the frets are closer together. As soon as possible strive to be able to switch between them in time, preferably in a musical way, there's a lot of good info already here about the mechanics of how to play a major triad barre chord whose root is based on the 6th string (Low E), that's essentially what you are learning to do when you learn the F chord, the Bb shape is really the open A shape up a fret, just as the F chord is the open E up a fret (with you're first finger acting as nut, that, thing your strings go over on the way to the tuners.) These two chord shapes go together, trust me, later you'll learn to move the Bb shape two frets higher (vertically up the fret board), and then Wah-Lah! you've learned thousands of songs instantly and you never have to practice again ... (just kidding about the no practice part). There are other inversion groups of triads that function together the exact same way, once you move away from playing all open chords you'll slowly realize the meaning of \"Transposing\", guitar is a \"Transposable\" instrument, what it means is since you can slide those two exact same shapes up and down the neck easily, those two shapes work in every single major key there is (not necessarily in every style). The scenario I've described here is a I-IV change, and later briefly a I-IV-V change(s) in music theory, at some point you'll run across that concept again, but that's an answer to a different question.
