            "answer_text": "As someone who has been playing Koto for a while, I feel I can answer. A koto is a type of zither. Ok, so what\u2019s a zither? A zither is an instrument that has the stings that are parallel to the sound box (not perpendicular like a harp) and the start and end of the strings are over or within the bounds of the soundbox (the is they don\u2019t have a neck - unless that neck is hollow and that hollow space is acoustically coupled to the sound box.) It\u2019s not harp, because harp strings are perpendicular to the soundbox. It\u2019s not a lute like thing (that also includes things like guitars or violins and the like) because it has no neck. The closest thing that most people have seen in the US is an autoharp (which also isn\u2019t a harp for the same reasons). But both kinds of dulcimers are also related. The normal koto is about 6\u2033 long and contains 13 strings. The strings are traditionally made from silk, but today are made from a plastic called Tetron that is much like Nylon except not quit so elastic, and is textured like silk such that when you move your claws lengthwise down the string it makes a sound that is supposed to resemble the wind. In more modern times koto with 17, 25, and more strings are available, but 17 is the next most common after 13 strings, and even the 17 string are quite rare. Koto is a member of the asian long curved zither family. In addition to the Japanese Koto, China has the Guzheng (with 21 strings), Korea has the Gayageum with 12 strings, and Viet Nam has the 16 string Dan Tranh. While the strings may be made out of differing material, they all share the characteristic of moving bridges as one way to tune the instrument. In koto the different modes (like western Major or Minor) as well as tunings are created by changing the positions of the ji (bridges.) Accidentals may be performed by pressing the strings to raise the pitch between 1 and 3 half steps, or pulling the strings to lower the pitch about 1/2 step. Koto is normally plucked with 3 dragon claws (tsume) held on the thumb, index, and middle finger by a band (wa) made out of paper or leather. They have \u201cvelcro\u201d ones as well\u2026but they are really horrible. The shape of the tsume derived from the Ikuta-ryu (Ikuta school) are rectangular and are the most common. The ones from the Yahada-ryu are like an elongated oval egg in shape. Today many people play the koto, but not so much in Japan. Koto in Japan is a lot like recorder or lute players in the west - they are active and vocal and keeping it alive, but few people really pay any attention. I play more traditional music, but I know koto players that are performing modern music like pop, jazz, or even rock and roll and reading western notated music Now that less expensive \u201ctuning peg\u201d koto from Korea or China that are available for under $1000 USD along with the ability to get lessons via SKYPE or other telepresence applications are bringing a resurgence of koto players from the West that may bring new blood the this most honorable of instruments.

            "answer_text": "A koto is a cousin to the dulcimer, and in some sense resembles a harp turned on its side and fitted into a frame (and in fact, the Japanese word for harp is tategoto, or standing koto). It\u2019s either related to or derived from similar stringed instruments across the Far East. Unlike a dulcimer \u2014 which is played variously with felt hammers, fingers, or a bow, depending on the style \u2014 a koto is plucked with special fake nails that fit on the ends of the fingers.  As a part of Japanese traditional culture, the koto is a semi-common thing for children or adults to practice, much like how American kids may be enrolled in piano or violin lessons. ",
