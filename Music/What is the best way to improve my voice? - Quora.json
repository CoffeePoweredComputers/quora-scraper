            "answer_text": "Improving your voice permanently is not a days job. It requires practice using the right techniques and staying committed towards it. Let's begin: Take deep and relax your throat muscles. Focus your mind on your throat and experience the relaxation in your throat during the breathing.Take a deep breath and create hhhmm sound by placing your thumb on the ear and 2 fingers on eyes with closed eyes.Improve the strong muscles of your neck. To do that lie down on the edge of a bed with your head in the air. Next, move your head up and down 10 times and relax. Do 3 reps of this. You can also turn your head right and left to strengthen neck side muscle.Place your hand on the forehead. Then press your head using the hand oppose the hand using your head. Do this for a duration of 10 secs. This would strengthen your neck muscle and make it stronger. Do similar activity by placing your hand at the right, left and back of your head. Remember don't push your head too hard.Do hot water and salt gargle. Do this 3 times a day. This clears your throat and you would experience a clear voice.Sleep for 7\u20138 hours. You might have experienced a deep voice when you wake up as your muscles are most relaxed during that time.Well with a good mix of strengthening and relaxing your neck muscle, great deep voice can be achieved over a period of time. Also, I would recommend to keep recording your voice to experience the difference in your voice. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two things you can do for your voice, and both require habit-forming. 1) The simpler one (esp. if you are interested in music, is to pick a note (swar) at the lower end of the octave and perfect your voice on it. If you are truly interested, buy a harmonium/keyboard (preferably harmonium), and reach the lowest note of the lowest octave that you can catch. Perfect it, then go lower. Taking help of a music teacher will help too. Alternatively, try humming/chanting the sound of \"Aum\" in the morning around sunrise. When your throat gets sore, drink luke warm water. Try doing this at the lowest note possible. Here is alink to the chant,   .  2) Make it a habit to speak at a lower pitch than you usually use. This will help your voice by a) Not making you strain your voice when you speak, b) make you used to speaking at a lower note/octave/pitch. People will also take you seriously.  Try these, I am sure these will help. I recovered my singing voice through these methods. I have some hoarseness even now, but I can hold notes much better now. ",
