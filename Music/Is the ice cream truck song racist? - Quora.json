            "answer_text": "The tune is known as Turkey in the Straw, and you can read about its history at that link.  While there exist a number of lyrics that have been adapted to the melody, I have before never heard of the version posted in this question, thank God! Personally, my favorite set of lyrics is this: Do Your Ears Hang Low?  Do your ears hang low?Do they wobble to and fro?Can you tie 'em in a knot?Can you tie 'em in a bow?Can you throw 'em o'er your shoulderLike a continental soldierDo your ears hang low? Turkey in the Straw was also used in the first Mickey Mouse animated film, Steamboat Willie. You can hear it around 4:10 minute mark.  So I believe the answer to your question is ...  no. ",
