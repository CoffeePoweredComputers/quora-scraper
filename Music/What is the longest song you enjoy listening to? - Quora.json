            "answer_text": "Shine On You Crazy Diamond part 1, at 13 minutes. The full song is a bit too long for my attention, but part 1 holds my attention perfectly with four distinct yet smooth movements. And Shine isn\u2019t an outlier either. Ancora is at 12 minutes, while Song of the North is 11 minutes. So yeah, I do like long songs, but it\u2019s hard to consistently create them. ",
