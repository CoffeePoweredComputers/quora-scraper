            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tough one. Nobody should play their music so loud that you have to hear it, no matter what the time of day. That\u2019s just common manners. Therefore, if they are doing it, they don\u2019t have the same sense of common manners as you do. So\u2026.. if it is during the day, try to shut it out by wearing earphones or closing doors etc. if possible. If it\u2019s so loud that you can\u2019t even block it out, then your neighbors are not only ignorant of common manners, but they are also jerks. So judge your actions accordingly; they know where you live and when you are not there. If it is a one time Quincenera with a Mariachi Band that keeps going after your \u201cHave to go to sleep, I got work\u201d time, then call the police to ask them to tone it down. DENY you made the call. In general, make sure your doors and windows and walls. are good at blocking out noise, set aside a \u201cmy jerk neighbors\u201d fund for having to use the A/C instead of open-air ventilation. Try to have a good relationship with your neighbors. Don\u2019t narc on yourself for calling the police. ",

I would like to take this person and tie them to a tree and whip them until I got tired then take a break and resume beating their ass again. I'd do this until they were pronounce legally insane or submissive to my slightest demand! Oh ain't this a bitch! No peace and quiet? What I would really like to do is talk to this idiot just to see which one of their parents were retarded or just plain old stupid. I have learned to value being wealthy whereas the authorities have the super power to rid us of jackasses such as the one you've expressed now. I wish I could be of help even if it means digging a trench around their abode and when they left home they would fall into a deep hole and die! Sorry for your troubles. ",
