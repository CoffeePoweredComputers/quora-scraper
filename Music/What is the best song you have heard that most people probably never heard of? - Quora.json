            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve got a couple here\u2013mainly Queen and Beatles because I know all their obscure songs. Keep Yourself Alive by Queen - one of their earliest songs and very underrated. Dragon Attack, also by Queen - a heavy song with not a lot of substance lyrically but it\u2019s got great instrumentals. I Want It All by Queen (I promise, last Queen song, I\u2019m just a big fan.) - another heavy song that guitarist Brian May obviously had a lot of influence in. It\u2019s cohesive lyrics coupled with a heavy, very well done guitar part by the fantastic Brian May make for a hidden gem amongst Queen\u2019s later, less popular songs, overshadowed by their hits of the 70s and early 80s. Kansas City / Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey by the Beatles - an early song off of \u201cBeatles for Sale\u201d that isn\u2019t too well known but a unique (for the Beatles), catchy blues track. Hello, Dolly! By Bobby Darin - a jazz song on the list. I\u2019m a pretty big Bobby Darin fan, would love to see him live one day\u2013oh wait. Anyway, it\u2019s a really swinging jazz song that starts slow and builds up over the course of the whole song, ending with a very satisfying stinger. Darin wasn\u2019t the first to do this, I don\u2019t think, but his rendition is my favorite. I\u2019ll Get By (As Long as I Have You) sung by Bill Kenny - this one\u2019s harder to find, it\u2019s on the Bill Kenny Sings the Golden Hits of the Ink Spots record. The song itself, recorded by the Ink Spots, isn\u2019t super obscure to anyone who knows who the Ink Spots are\u2013looking at you, fellow Fallout fans\u2013but this particular, hard-to-find rendition by the Ink Spots\u2019 own Bill Kenny is very, very good. It has lots of energy and is quite fun to listen to. That version isn\u2019t available on Spotify or iTunes (showing its obscureness) but it is on Youtube. Here\u2019s the link:  All the other songs are easier to find. Maybe these aren\u2019t quite obscure enough but your average person wouldn\u2019t know about them. I recommend you to listen to some of these if you\u2019re a rock fan. Or in the case of Hello, Dolly/I\u2019ll Get By, jazz fan. EDIT: Teo Torriate by Queen - a very emotional and moving song that sends chills down your spine. It\u2019s not well known and usually flies under the radar, but it is one of the most beautiful songs I\u2019ve ever listened to. I absolutely recommend giving it a listen even if you don\u2019t like Queen or rock very much. ",

            "answer_text": "The one that immediately came to mind to me was \"Wish You Away\" by Esthero. This track only appeared as the Japanese bonus track to her debut album Breath From Another, which is my favorite album of all time.  If I remember the story correctly, Esthero wrote the track after a chance encounter with an old crush on the streets of Toronto. That immediate rush of excitement gave way to disappointment as the man told her he was moving away. Esthero immediately got in the studio with whatever equipment she could and recorded the song. Because of the rush, she had to record the song on lo-fi equipment, unlike the rest of her album. The label asked her to re-record the song with proper equipment, and Esthero refused because she knew she could never re-create the emotion that fueled the initial recording. So, they didn't add it to the album, but ended up adding it to the Japanese version.    Lyrics:Another sock in the belly dayWhy don't you go awayInside your storm, it kinda keeps me warmAt nightWell IKnow it to be trueSwirling through, inside youYour light is my lightYour light After you left I couldn't sleepI have nowhere to beAnd if you go then I go tooAnd if you leave then I will find youI will find youI was kicked in the belly todayAnd it wasn't fair playI would scream but I've too much to sayLife isn't fair play Wish You AwayCan't Go AwayWish You AwayDon't Go AwayWish You AwayDon't Go AwayYou were never here anyway...
