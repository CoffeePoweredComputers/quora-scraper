            "answer_text": "The first thing that you have to do is enroll in an acting school and learn the craft. Acting is an art and a craft that requires lots of skill and technique, and classes are a great place to learn the basics. There are also acting workshops that you can go to and these will dedicate even more time to teaching you how to be an actor. Acting classes are also beneficial because they look good on a resume and are a good place to network. The next step is to participate in theater like with any job, actors need to have a resume that highlights their acting experience and capabilities. You can gain this experience from drama clubs, community theater, school productions etc. You can also get experience and get comfortable on the stage by taking part in improvisation nights, talent shows, and open mic nights in your city. There are a number of ways that acting for film is different from theater and other kinds of acting. To become a successful film actor, you need to learn and practice the different skills that are unique to the craft. There's nobody better than an experienced actor to help set you on the right path, because this person has already experienced exactly what you're going through. Ask around at your community theater or drama club to see if there are any established actors who might take you under their wing. Mentors can give you pointers, introduce you to others in the industry, teach you tricks of the trade, give advice about where to find roles, and help you hone your craft. It\u2019s not always possible to jump into the entertainment industry and get a job as an actor right away. Many of the famous actors out there today got their start by working in the industry and on-set doing things other than acting. Apply for jobs doing stunts, on the crew, or as a prop person. Get work as an extra. Extras are the background actors in movies, so they don\u2019t usually have speaking parts. However, it\u2019s sometimes a paying gig and it can get you exposure, and there are famous actors out there who were discovered while working as extras. Sometimes your connections in the industry can be just as important as any talent that you have, so the more people you know, the easier it will be to get an acting job. Because acting is such a physical and appearance-based profession, it\u2019s important for actors to have head shots available when they're trying to get a casting call or make new connections also make a showreel of your past work that you consider as your best work. Having an agent isn't strictly necessary to land roles, but an agent\u2019s sole job is to help you find work, and this can facilitate you finding your first few gigs. Check online to see if there are agents in your area taking on new clients. Just be careful about the agency you join. Agents make money when they find gigs for clients, so don\u2019t accept help from someone who wants a membership fee. Audition for any role you can, no matter how small the part or how low-budget the film. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t want the part\u2014audition practice is invaluable, and the role could end up being a good opportunity. The more auditions you do the more roles you'll get, and the more parts you have, the more likely it is that you'll get noticed and be given more opportunities as an actor.
