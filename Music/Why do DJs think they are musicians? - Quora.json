            "answer_text": "A DJ does a lot of things that make them musicians. First, they use their library of music to create cohesive compositions and arrangements of music that make sense in terms of the event they are servicing. This is called mixing. When you mix songs, you need to understand two basic musical concepts: key and tempo. First, when mixing music, you need to consider how different songs will transition into one another. Ideally, you don't want to go from a super fast song that people have been dancing to a super slow song. You would want to make that move gradually through a number of songs slowly lowering the tempo each time. Secondly, DJs actually compose/remix music by mixing songs simultaneously. Software/DJ equipment allows you to digitally isolate ranges of frequencies of the songs you are playing. Plainly put, if you have two songs in a similar key, you can mute the bass in one song and add the bass from another track playing at the same time. This requires great timing skills, even when using software that does a lot of the work for you. You also need to have a great ear when it comes to knowing which songs mix well. Just because the software indicates that two songs have similar tempo and key, it doesn't mean mixing them will sound good. Those are the attributes of a musicians and separate DJs from people who just play songs through an AUX cord. A DJ is an artist that pretty much controls the vibe of an event. The music being played (and the way it's being played) could impact who you meet and interact with during that event. That is why certain DJs are paid so well. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to ask this question. But then I realised that it's all just different flavours for different people. DJ\u2019s have their style, their music and their crowd and instrumental musicians have their style and crowd and on it goes. Some DJ\u2019s produce their own stuff (assuming it's one of those types of dj\u2019s) and I think some DJ\u2019s you can learn a lot from. I watched an interview with Avicii talking about his workflow and it was interesting to see the mindset/approach that he uses to compose and complete tracks. He admitted that he doesn't know theory and he just clicks around the midi roll until he finds the right sound. I like that he just backs his ears and is uninhibited by theory. So for that I would call him a musician. Times are changing. It's easy to make music. There are so many tools for composition out there that basically anyone with any amount of motivation and a bit of gear or a smartphone can create music. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m an instrumentalist and it frustrates me that for some reason it totally sounds like s$&@ when I try to make electronic music. It's just not my jam\u2026 Bit of food for though. ",
