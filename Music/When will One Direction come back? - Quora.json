Also louis tweeted \u201cpromise \u201c right after the band annouced they are taking break and will reunite after.(i tried to search that tweet but i didnt get it :( ) Also on ticket master , a mysterious date appear as 31 december 2020 claiming one direction tour at ETHIAD STADIUM , MELBOURNE AUSTRALIA. BUT OFFICIALLY NOT ANY BAND MEMBER MENTION ABOUT REUNION. Recently liam payne tweeted about the capital official best fans award , thanking direction , even if the boys are on hiatus still one directiok is winning capitals best fans award 4 years in row .  Also one direction official account liked the post of capital official on instagram .  Also one direction official account on instagram unfollowed many accounts . They were following about 85 people now they are following 54 people. And this means that someone is using one direction account.  All this give me hope that they reunite in 2020 . And I know this is of topic but please vote for our boys ( OHMUSIC AWARD). VOTE And top music awards . Its mixers vs directioner , army vs zquad BIGGEST FANS ARMY Thank you.\u263a ",

            "answer_text": "As much as I love 1D, I would not want them to come back together as a boy band. One Direction have already started their careers as soloists and two (Liam and Louis) are already fathers. The boys have gone so far, releasing albums going on tour, featuring big stars and appearing on popular T.V. shows. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll want to lose that. They also have their more personal struggles like Louis and Eleanor who\u2019s relationship is still questionable, Louis\u2019s baby Freddy, Liam and Cheryl\u2019s break up, Liam\u2019s baby Bear, Zayn\u2019s \u201cbreak up\u201d with Gigi, Niall\u2019s secret relationship with Hailee Steinfield, and Harry just being Harry. The boys are grown up now. They seem too mature to go back to their old ways. I think they\u2019ve realized that too. As much as I and the rest of the fandom would want that, I doubt it would happen soon. The least we directioners can do is cry as we watch the fetus days of One Direction. I hope they still stay friends though. And a reunion concert where they sing two songs from every album would be nice too. ",

Remember Niall tweeting how he was ready for a reunion if it happens tomorrow? And Louis liking that tweet? And let's not forget that Liam said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe the band are breaking records nearly every week while we\u2019re on hiatus. It\u2019s quite insane. \u2018But it makes me more proud to be a part of it and I can\u2019t wait for the comeback.\u2019 Neither can't we dude! Get it sorted, will you? But let's also not forget how it all came downhill. How they got bad addictions and insecurities, diseases and health conditions. I don't think I need to elaborate this, they've all shared their fair amount of stories of life while being One Direction. Of course I want them to come back more than anything. But at the risk of their happiness and health? No, not at all. I can live with having to stan 5 different people. Moreover, I am sure we all can tolerate this hiatus if they keep releasing their amazayn songs. ",

            "answer_text": "They only know that answer themselves. However here are some things to ponder. The first being who is in control of the boys being Simon Cowell he promoted them heavily on their last tour but in typical Cowell style he seems to have lost interest and moved on to the next new sensation. Secondly the band wasn't really formed in the nature of a local band that has put in the time paid their dues and have devoleped chemistry. In One Directions case they started as individual contestants on the British version of America's got talent and Cowell grouped them up together. They didn't really have any loyalties to each other and it seems they are now not one direction but gone many directions. I doubt you will see them back ",
