            "answer_text": "YouTube\u2019s Content Identification system is not the best piece of software ever written. It misses things. Some countries have different laws with respect to how much you can use without infringing. Some rights-holders are more energetic about finding violations. Here, you\u2019re looking at Korean artists and distribution and a US company. It\u2019s entirely possible that the Korean rights-holder has either not noticed the violation, or failed to protest it in a way that YouTube\u2019s processors recognize. YouTube is doing the minimum it can to ensure that it qualifies under the US\u2019 DMCA Safe Harbor rules. It benefits from the ad revenue whether the content violates the rights of someone or not, as long as it cannot itself be sued. There are no similar Safe Harbor rules of people using someone else\u2019s content. The Fair Use Guidelines are for judges ruling on the use of a defense after you\u2019ve already been sued. And if you\u2019re sued, even if you win immediately, you\u2019re going to spend tens of thousands of dollars defending yourself. If you lose, it will get really expensive. Basically, trying to get away with things that you think others are getting away with is a classic Bad Idea. The others may have permission. They may be luckier than you are. Or they may have been caught and be in the process of losing everything that they own now, or will own in the next ten years. You have no way to know, nor can you rely on the same amount of luck. Do it right \u2014 get permission for the material you want to use. ",
