            "answer_text": "Well, you haven't really mentioned your taste, or any specific 'genre' of music. You've just said that it has to be 'English'. So I'd assume you're just getting in to Western music. Forgive me if I'm wrong. I could just give an endless list of classics and say these are the best, but I think it would be wiser to give you a taste of many genres, and let you decide. Classic Rock:1. Sweet Child O' Mine - Guns N' Roses2. Stairway to heaven - Led Zeppelin3. Hotel California - The Eagles4. Highway to Hell - AC/DC (You'll recognize AC/DC from the Iron Man franchise)5. I Can't Get No Satisfaction - The Rolling Stones6. You Give Love A Bad Name - Bon Jovi7. Californication - Red Hot Chili Peppers (not really classic rock but I couldn't make a separate list for them, this song is too good to not include) (If you like these, listen to more from them. Also check out Blondie, Deep Purple,Cream etc.)  Rap:1. In Da Club - 50 Cent (I mean really, you have got to have heard this one)2. Lose Yourself - Eminem3. Without Me - Eminem (demonstrates Eminem's less serious side)4. Hey Ya - Outkast5. Run This Town - Jay Z, Rihanna, Kanye6. Good Life - Kanye West(Note this is just to get you interested, there many more like Tupac, B.I.G etc. if you get going) Pop: (This is a very fought about genre so I will just include some modern ones to avoid conflict)1. Blank Space - Taylor Swift2. Boom Clap - Charlie XCX3. How to Save A Life - The Fray (I don't know if it fits in with the others but I'm sure you'd like it)4.Counting Stars - One Republic5. Thinking Out Loud - Ed Sheeran EDM:1. Memories - David Guetta2. Stay The Night - ZEDD3. Ocarina - Dmitri Vegas & Like Mike4. Levels - AVICII5. Wake Me Up - AVICII Really there are an infinite amount of songs which I'd personally recommend you listen, and it breaks my heart to only list out so few, but I can't write a never ending post. I hope you like these :) Note: I'd given this exact answer in this question Rohit Mohanty's answer to What are good English songs? as well. Instead of making you click the link and go there I just pasted the answer here. ",
