            "answer_text": "The lowest I\u2019ve heard is the response here, $18 an hour for lessons. The highest I\u2019ve seen is above $25. I\u2019m sure there is lower and higher out there. Plus you receive annual raises. It sounds like it\u2019s all regional. Instructors in Hollywood might make more than instructors in Topeka, KS. The key to making big(ger) money as an instructor is to be able to teach a lot of different instruments and styles. A person who can only teach saxophone isn\u2019t going to last long at GC. I teach all of the instruments they offer, and I have to say I love my job. Plus the discount is sick. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe I made an hourly wage which was $9/ hour, but also a per lesson wage of another $9. So, if I have an hour lesson, I would make $18. If I gave a half hour lesson, $9. Pay isn't great, for teaching, but there are some other things to consider\u2026 They recruit the students for you (if you have a good lessons lead like I did [she had pressure from corporate to maintain x-amount of students] then you'll get plenty, especially as a guitar instructor). They provide the lesson room, equipment, and curriculum. You get a sweet discount on gear! So at the end of the day, it's not a terrible gig\u2026 ",
