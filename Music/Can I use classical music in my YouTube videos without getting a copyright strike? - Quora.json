            "answer_text": "Well, no one can really guarantee you won\u2019t get a copyright strike for no reason at all. Ask the guy who got one for a recording of just his own voice. The algorithms or bots or whatever that search for and send in such notices are somewhat famously unreliable. That said, there are two factors you need to consider. A) Is the song itself copyrighted, or is it in the public domain. Most classical music would be, but there is some more recent music that can be considered \u201cclassical\u201d music that is still not quite public domain. If it isn\u2019t yet public domain, then using it would run you the risk of getting a strike. B) If the song itself is public domain, is the recording of the song copyright free? Was it either released without copyright (or is it something I own the rights to). Even if a song is in the public domain specific recordings of it are allowed to be copyrighted, what ISN\u2019T allowed to be copyrighted is the actual song. Meaning Let\u2019s say I want to do a dub step remix of Fur Elise\u2026cause reasons. It\u2019s public domain\u2026I can really do whatever I want to do. I don\u2019t have to seek permission from anyone. I can sell as many copies of it as I want. I can copyright it, and if other content creators want to use it in their videos they have to seek my permission. Now\u2026if someone took my idea and wanted to do a totally different dub step remix\u2026or a trance remix or whatever\u2026they wouldn\u2019t need my permission, because I wouldn\u2019t own right to the song itself, just my version of it. TL;DR Yes, so long as both the song and recording are copyright free. ",

            "answer_text": "You can play old classical music on an instrument yourself. Any old composition, with everything older than 95 years being safe in the U.S. (and some not that old, but it gets complicated). But you cannot use audio recordings of other people playing music. Any music. Any audio recording, no matter how old. In the U.S., every audio recording has its own copyright. And due to a quirk in U.S. law, the standard durations won\u2019t even start until 2064. So no, you cannot use them without permission. ",

So instead, you might want to either use the music from the Youtube Music library YouTube or pay a few dollars and buy royalty free music on Jamendo or another such site. You are free to use any of the music from the Youtube Music Library in your Youtube videos and there is a lot of really wonderful music in the library. ",
