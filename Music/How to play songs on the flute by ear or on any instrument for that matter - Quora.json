            "answer_text": "OK, this one is very interesting to me, because I'm one of those people born with a absolute pitch. It's actually hard to give the best answer on how-to, because I simply hear and know that this is, for example, a \"C\", and not a \"D\", or a \"A\" (and not a \"B flat\"). Moreover, when it comes to my absolute pitch, I can only by hearing it by one second tell exactly what chord it is, is it major, minor, dim, 7th, whatever-else, as well as what is root note of that particular chord. There are a lot of chords for whose I don't know names, because I don't have any musical degree (reasons are there was no money for that, although it would be a lot of use for me today), but there comes something instead: I can exactly tell (not to guess like a Lotto numbers, but EXACTLY tell) which notes are played in a such chord. And no one never fooled me, although many tried by tuning guitar strings on the wrong tune, using transpose function or pitch bender on keyboard, and so on. They even tried with glasses (empty and filled with some drink), metal spoons, forks, dishes, anythig that produce some pitch, but I always knew what tone was it. But this is just one side of medal. It's not the same to know what note(s) someone played and you've heard, and repeat what you just heard on your instrument, this one takes practice, practice, and more practice. Did I mention practice? So, like all other people, I also must to practice to be able to correctly play what I hear. I'm working in a recording studio and there were many situations when my absolute pitch come in handy. Here is one: a technician colleague recorded one singer who sang in a wrong pitch. But no one figured it until I came, because they called me. They knew something's wrong, but not what's wrong. They played the freshly recorded song to me and as soon as the song started I've said: \"Stop! I've heard enough. The song is in F Major, but the singer just sang it in F# Major!\". They know about my absolute pitch, but were stunned by this one. They also agreed about the song in F Major. So one of people took a guitar and asked technician to play only the vocal part of the song, just to check what I've just said, and guess what! Once again my absolute pitch was flawless! Honestly, I've heard various flaws in singing, but really don't know how the singer was able to sing it raised for a half tone, but tones were correct, only in a wrong intonation. Many people asked me about how I represent these tones in my head, like do I see some colors or something. Well, it's not as simple as colors. I see colors, of course, but these colors are actually arranged into a vivid pictures, which also represent some moods, memories, and similar. ",

            "answer_text": "There is an old saying \u201cIf you can hum it then you can strum it\u201d. so the first thing is to internalize the melody to the point that you can accurately hum it, if not with your voice then at least in your head Then, figure out if it is in a Minor or Major scale (or something else). Is the songs MELODY (not lyrics) happy or sad sounding? Next, try to figure out the root note. This will usually be the note the seems to resolve the melody, but not always, especially if the song is in an odd scale mode (like when the saints go marching in) With the key and scale in mind you will have to start experimenting until you discover the notes involved. This will be easier over time as you become better at recognizing different intervals. This interval recognition is key to successfully playing thing by ear. Mastering this will give you you what is called RELATIVE PITCH and as you get better with this you will be able to tackle even the hardest jazz pieces. Start with simple tunes (like nursery rhymes) and work toward pop melodies. Before you know it you will be able to play guitar solos by ear. For more information, study relative pitch and harmonic analysis. ",
