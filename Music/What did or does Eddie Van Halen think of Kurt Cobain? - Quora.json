            "answer_text": "I don't know their thoughts of each other, but in contrast to what someone else posted about them kissing, this is what I read in an excerpt from Charles R. Cross's Heavier Than Heaven about them meeting at the end of 1993: The difference between sobriety and intoxication was never more clearly illustrated than on December 30, when Nirvana played a show at the Great Western Forum near Los Angeles. Filmmaker Dave Markey was videotaping that night and observed a display of inebriation so extreme, he turned his camera off in pity. And it wasn\u2019t Kurt who was a mess\u2014it was Eddie Van Halen. The famed guitar player was backstage on his knees drunk, begging Krist to let him jam. Kurt arrived only to see his one-time hero collapsing toward him with his lips puckered, like a toasted Dean Martin in a bad Rat-Pack skit. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t play with us,\u201d Kurt flatly announced. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any extra guitars.\u201d Van Halen didn\u2019t grasp this obvious lie and pointed to Pat Smear, shouting, \u201cWell, then let me play the Mexican\u2019s guitar. What is he, is he Mexican? Is he black?\u201d Kurt couldn\u2019t believe his ears. \u201cEddie went into this racist, homophobic banter, typical redneck,\u201d observed Dave Markey. \u201cIt was surreal.\u201d Kurt was furious, but finally came up with a worthy verbal response: \u201cActually, you can jam,\u201d he promised. \u201cYou can go onstage after our encore. Just go up there and solo by yourself!\u201d Kurt stormed off. One thing to note is that Markey said Van Halen was a \u201ctypical redneck\" whereas he was born and raised in the Netherlands. I had to share this because Kurt said not to believe everything you read, and here I'm surprised to see two opposite stories one where he's disgusted by EVH and another where he's literally kissing him on the lips.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know how true this is but there is a story that I\u2019ve heard many times where Eddie Van Halen and Kurt Cobain did meet each other once. Kurt was nervous what Eddie would think of him but Eddie came up and gave Kurt a big kiss on the mouth! I think that means that he liked him. Edit: I just looked it up and apparently it was Kurt who kissed Eddie. But Eddie was hanging out in Kurt\u2019s dressing room at a Nirvana show so I still think Eddie must\u2019ve liked Kurt at least a little. https://metalheadzone.com/nirvanas-kurt-cobain-kisses-eddie-van-halen-on-the-mouth-story-has-been-exposed/ ",
