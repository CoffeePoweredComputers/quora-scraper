            "answer_text": "I first heard the name Billie Eilish about 4 weeks ago when I decided to turn on my radio, I didn't pay much attention. The next day I turned on my radio again and someone ( an OAP) was about playing a Billie Eilish song Bad Guy. The day after that I turned on my radio and the presenters were talking about Billie Eilish . At that point I was like, who's she? The presenters where talking about how she's the next big thing in music and how she's now the most talked about person on the planet. One of the presenters (a female) was like \" when I'm I going to be famous\" ? The other (a male) told her \"your song didn't go viral on soundcloud\" She said \"I know but I also sing and I talk on the radio!\" \"Well that's good, but not good enough, however if you do become famous, don't forget about me\" the male presenter said. Now back to Billie Eilish, this got me thinking \"She's the most talked about person on the planet!\" Since I have a category on my blog Success Facts dedicated to success facts about famous and successful people, then she will be the perfect fit for my next posts. After gathering everything I could find about her on Google, here's what I came up with: 15 Facts About Billie Eilish and How She Became Famous.  1. Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 18, 2001 to Maggie Baird and Patrick O'Connell, both of whom are in the entertainment industry. 2. She is of Irish and Scottish descent and was raised in Los Angeles' Highland Park 3. Eilish (pronounced \u201ceye-lish\u201d) was homeschooled alongside her brother and was taking dance classes and singing in the Los Angeles Children\u2019s Chorus by 8 years old. By 11, she was writing her own songs. She also made several short films. She shot them on a camera and edited them on \u2018iMovie,\u2019 \u2018Apple\u2019s video-editing app. 4. \"Homeschooling has been really interesting because it's kind of my parents' way of having us focus on things we're really interested in instead of being at school and being taught things that you don't really need to know in life \u2014 things you're never going to remember or use,\" Eilish said in an interview with PAPER 5. Her father would make her mixtapes featuring everything from Green Day to The Beatles, and, aged nine, Eilish would later perform \u2018Happiness Is A Warm Gun\u2019 at her home-school talent show. 6. She started gaining attention and a following in 2016 with the release of her debut single \u201cOcean Eyes,\u201d \"One of my teachers asked if I would either write a song or have my brother write a song to choreograph a dance to,\" she told Teen Vogue. \"I was like, 'Yes, that's such a cool thing to do!'\" That's when her brother gave her the song \"Ocean Eyes,\" one he wrote for his band but thought it would sound better in his sister's voice. 7. According to Eilish, they recorded the song and posted it on SoundCloud for her teacher to check out. The next day, she got a call from her brother. \"He was like 'Dude, we got 1000 listens,'\" she told Junkee. \"That was such a big deal at the time, even though 1000 is basically nothing compared to everything else in the world. But at the time it was a huge deal. We just thought we made it. And then it just kept growing, and then it got really big.\" It now has over 200 million Spotify plays. 8. She has been accused of never smiling in her photos. She has responded by saying \u201csmiling makes me feel weak and not in control and not powerful and small.\" 9. Her debut album When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? released March 29, 2019 made her the first artist born in the 2000s to have a number one album in the United States. She's also the youngest female artist ever to have a number 1 album in the UK. 10. Eilish\u2019s brother, Finneas actually collaborates with his little sister on almost all of her songs, which is super sweet. When he\u2019s not busy doing that, he\u2019s also an actor, with recurring roles in TV shows like Gleeand Modern Family\u2014so he might seem familiar. 11. She has Tourettes and after a video compilation of her tics went viral Eilish revealed she had the disorder. She spoke to The Fader saying: \u201cThe internet hasn\u2019t really seen the bad [tics] because I\u2019m really good at suppressing them. The thing is, the longer you suppress them, the worse they get afterwards. I\u2019m sure one day everyone will see the tic attacks that happen when I\u2019m stressed and haven\u2019t slept. But it could be a lot worse and it\u2019s not, and I\u2019m grateful for that. And you know what, it\u2019s f***ing whatever.\u201d 12. Eilish has seven gold and two platinum singles 13. She was placed on the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 list in November of that year. 14. Billie Eilish has recorded two songs for Netflix's 13 Reason Why (executive produced by Selena Gomez). She featured on the Season 1 soundtrack with \u2018bored' and the Season 2 soundtrack with her hit Khalid collaboration \u2018lovely'. 15. In February 2018, Eilish embarked on the Where's My Mind Tour, which concluded in April 2018 with the hopes of eventually launching a clothing line and directing music videos. \u201cPeople ask me what I want to have accomplished in 10 years,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I say is, I don\u2019t want to have taken all of this for granted.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "TD:DR: Good songs that appeal to a wide audience + excellent marketing over the past 4 years = popularity. Billie Eilish is an example of what the majority of musicians do not seem to participate in\u2014proper branding and marketing. We need to go back 10 years. This is not a girl who became an overnight sensation. Her parents are actors and screenwriters.Her brother was in a band that had management when he was a teen and was on Glee.Her brother is the composer and primary lyricist. Billie was in the LA Children's choir when she was 8She did voiceover work on several \u201cbig\u201d shows as a youngin. A Dance instructor asked for her brother and Billie to create a song for a routine\u2014Ocean Eyes, IIRC. This song went viral. Her brother went to his management company, who then signed Billie to a development deal with Darkroom/Interscope. She then started working on Image and Branding with Channel (fashion house) while releasing singles for the past 3.5 years. The management/label hired publicists and PR companies to promote her and built a compelling story around her to build up a sizable fanbase. Once there was a big enough fanbase to sell an album to, they told her brother to start producing an album. Finneas and Billie worked on an album that modeled the popular playlists in her genre so that it would be a digestible album in the age of streaming - with slightly different sounding songs. Then the PR machine and the label released it and it charted big. All the while, she and her brother were playing shows, building relationships with fans. This is the formula that records labels used to use with new artists. But the last 20 years, labels would not develop and artist. The songs are darker sounding, and appeal to other teen girls. But they also have catchy hooks which are appealing to a wider audience. The songs are good. The production is decent, but it was 4 years of marketing and hard work to move the needle. Many people think she is an overnight sensation, but most overnight sensations are 3 to 5 years in the making. ",
