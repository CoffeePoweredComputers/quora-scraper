This will affect the headphone type.Source. Phone, DAP, or separates in a rack at home? The best headphones in the world connected to an iPhone will sound like crap.Budget. Best can get pricy, but doesn\u2019t have to.For me, I like US made audio companies. I can say they make some of the best gear in the world. I am also of the mindset that buying less of better things is good. i.e. save for a bit better gear that you won\u2019t want to upgrade for years. I will point to a few companies, though it only scratches the surface of what is good. IEMs: In ear design. Light weight, small to carry. Usually doesn\u2019t take much for amplifier power to drive to ear bleeding levels. Two companies that spring to mind for top notch design, materials, and sound quality are Campfire Audio and Noble Audio. To squeeze the best sound out of such IEMs you will need and external amplifier or a decent DAP. Full sized headphone. Over the ear, either open or closed back. Potential for being mobile, but really are for home/office use. I have closed back myself, as it helps block out the kids playing (IEMs can do this too, but my ear canals can\u2019t tolerate more than an hour or so. My sister on the other hand wears her IEMs for hours at a time). I personally like Mr. Speakers orthodynamic full sized headphones. The Ether Flow are top notch. I like their sound and fit. Another US maker is Audeze. They are also orthodynamic and have a different house sound than Mr. Speakers. To really get the best out of top headphones, a high quality source and amplifier is required. Kind of like having a sports car with super sticky tires. I suggest looking at gear from Schiit Audio. They prove that it doesn\u2019t take super high prices to achieve great sound. Their various desktop amplifiers can accommodate both IEMs and full sized headphones with a flick of a switch. After all that, it will come down to your listening preferences in the end. Everyone hears differently. Sound perception is unique to the individual. Hence so many speakers and headphone companies that offer products that all sound a bit different from one another. I prefer the sound of Mr. Speakers, but you could prefer a cheaper model from another company and be just as happy. This is the advice I give each person I work with in choosing audio gear. My Schiit stack of gear makes me super happy when listening. It isn\u2019t the most expensive by far. If it makes you happy in the end, if it gets you to boogie around the room, that is the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you want normal headphones, or in ear phones? Do you want them to be noise cancelling and/or wireless? I have cooked it down to \u201cnormal\u201d wired headphones here. I assume it has to be within a reasonable price limit, if not the Focal Utopia and Audioquest Nightowls or one of Audeze models, not to talk about Stax Earspeakers with electrostatic drivers would be good choices. But these cost a little fortune. Focal Utopia  Stax Earspeakers with little tubeamp to drive them.  But if you want some good all around headphones, names like Sennheiser, AKG, Grado, Sony, Pioneer, Yamaha, Beyerdynamics and Bowers and Wilkins are some of the good choices outthere. There are so many. You have to go out in some shops that have a good selection of headphones, and listen to the different models, thats the only way to find the ones you think are great for you. If you choose from the names I have wrote here, you have all chances to find the headphones for you. Last I wanna mention a name that many dont see often, but that have a great sound to the price.NAD VISO HP50. They can be found from around 150$ and op to 250$, so it its good to look after the best deal. Awesome headphones to the price. Its actually impossible to find a bad test of them on the Internet. From\u201d Inner Fidelitys\u201d Tyll Hertsens : SummarySimply put: The NAD VISO HP50 is my favorite sealed headphone to date for general purpose use. Paul Barton's \"Room Feel\" headphone response curve intended to make a headphone sound tonally similar to good speakers in a good room seems to do exactly that; these headphones have a very pleasing, somewhat warm sound that doesn't get in the way of the details. Bass is deep and tight, midrange is well tonally balanced, and the treble is nicely articulated without being harsh\u2014though the top octave might benefit from a slight lift. These are sealed headphones however, and are not quite as coherent and airy sounding as some open headphones.  Sound quality alone would get these headphones onto the \"Wall of Fame\", but the real strength of these cans is that they perform so very well in so many ways. The look is elegant and clean without any pretention; they're light, comfortable, and secure on the head; isolation is quite good and will make for a relatively quiet commute; they pack away in the included carry case in a remarkably thin size; and last but not least, they're very fairly priced in my opinion. Yup, \"Wall of Fame\" bound, they'll knock off the Sennheiser Momentum largely due to ergonomics, but I also like the sound a bit better.  ",
