            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Before anyone gets upset, I\u2019ll explain. John was 19 when he joined Queen. He was painfully shy. So was Freddie, despite his showy onstage persona. Freddie took John under his wing and protected him in the beginning. \u201cLiar\u201d (1973) has a part where John joins Freddie. They shared a mic. That\u2019s not anything major, except for the fact that John never sang on any other Queen track to that extent. Not to mention, that\u2019s the time when John and Freddie were rumored to be dating. On Instagram, an account that was supposedly John\u2019s said that while he was never bisexual, he was in love with Freddie and had a brief fling with him in 1973\u201374. Once the post started gaining traction, John made his account private and changed his handle. In 1975, he married his girlfriend, Veronica. That same year, Freddie wrote \u201cLove of My Life\u201d. It couldn\u2019t have been about Mary because Mary Austin hadn\u2019t left him yet. He hadn\u2019t met David Minns yet either. So, it seems like he wrote it about John. After 1975, there are zero affectionate pictures of the two. They\u2019re friendly, but nothing like before Veronica. There are some pictures of the two cuddling. Yes, two guys can show affection and not be sexual or romantic. However, there was a picture of Freddie on John\u2019s lap. John looked content but almost scared at the same time. I don\u2019t think that, as much as he loved Freddie, he was ever comfortable with possibly being biromantic. That\u2019s why this is merely my opinion based off of what I\u2019ve observed, not something that has been absolutely confirmed by John. Out of respect for him, I\u2019m not going to say that it is. No matter what their relationship, they definitely had a lot of love for each other and were best friends for as long as Freddie lived. Some pictures of the two (in 1973\u201375):       ",

            "answer_text": "The John and Freddie relationship is to me the most intriguing of all the band members, and I find it interesting that so many people think they had a romantic relationship. I can see where there would be an attraction between the two. There is something sweet and romantic about the two of them being involved and I can see where they would be quite compatible with each other. I don\u2019t think they had that kind of relationship though. John was only 11 when his father passed away unexpectedly. It\u2019s been stated in numerous articles and interviews that the loss of his father was quite traumatic for John and that he never really got over it. It doesn\u2019t sound like his mother remarried or that anyone stepped in as a surrogate father to him. I think it is more likely that Freddie filled the void in John\u2019s life that the death of his father left. People that knew the both of them said Freddie was very protective of John in the early days. To me it seems he took nurturing role with John, and that this relationship evolved into a mentoring role and eventually a musical partnership. I think Freddie understood John better than Roger and Brian did (or better than most people), and that he was very supportive of John, especially in Queen\u2019s earlier years. Freddie encouraged John to write songs, and worked closely with him to interpret his music the way John wanted it to be interpreted. I believe the two shared a very deep and unique bond. I guess it\u2019s possible it could have been romantic at one point, but I think it is more likely that it was more of an older brother/younger brother or even a surrogate father type of relationship.
