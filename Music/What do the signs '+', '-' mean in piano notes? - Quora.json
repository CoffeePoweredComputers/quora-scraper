            "answer_text": "This looks to me like some sort of home-made code for pitch and rhythm notation. Possibly the + means to hold the note for one more value of whatever you are holding it for. So the first three notes (B C# and D) would be played eighth, quarter, quarter (or possibly quarter, half, half). I glean that from most of the groupings adding up to eight (with some errors, that is). Maybe. Without knowing  what the person meant who wrote it, we can only guess. Any idea what the title/composer is?  ",
