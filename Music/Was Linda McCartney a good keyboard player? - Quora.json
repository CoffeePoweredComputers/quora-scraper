            "answer_text": "At first she was an amateur thrust into the spotlight. She could play easy parts. If a Wings song required intricate detailed piano or keyboard playing in concerts, Linda would step aside and let Paul take over, or sometimes Denny Laine, both good and professional with keyboards. Her role in the band was to provide limited music that enhanced the sound. Her part of the music was never too complex for her to handle. She also provided backing vocals. Her voice blended well with Paul and Denny. By 1975 the three of them won a Grammy Award for best vocal group! I found this interesting comment: \u201cWhat a testament to Paul's arranging abilities it was that he was able to construct Wings arrangements around keyboard parts that were simple enough for a near novice to play.\u201d It seems equally likely Paul added in keyboard parts for Linda to play rather than \u201cwork around\u201d her. I feel she worked hard, improved fast and was good at what she did for the band but she had never intended to be a musician. She did it for love! ",
