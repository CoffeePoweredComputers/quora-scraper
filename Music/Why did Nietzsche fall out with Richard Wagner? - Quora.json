            "answer_text": "Nietzsche believed in heroes and, in his youth, was a hero worshiper. First Schopenhauer and after that Wagner. When the Wagner of the philosopher\u2019s dreams turned into a Wagner of very prosaic flesh and blood, there came a time of doubt and stress and suffering for Nietzsche. But he had the courage as well as loyalty, and in the end he dashed his old idol to pieces and crushed the bits underfoot. Faith, doubt, disillusion\u2014it is not a rare sequence in this pitiless and weary old world. Those sapient critics who hold that Nietzsche discredited his own philosophy by constantly writing against himself, find their chief ammunition in his attitude toward the composer of Tristan und Isolde. In the decade from 1869 to 1878 the philosopher was the kind of German Wagnerians. In the decade from 1879 to 1889, he was the most violent, the most resourceful and the most effective of Wagner\u2019s critics. On their face these things seem to indicate a complete change of front and a careful examination bears out the thought. But the same careful examination reveals another fact: that the change of front was made, not by Nietzsche, but by Wagner. I t is only fair to mention that Wagner\u2019s admirers see Nietzsche\u2019s break with the master in a different light. Thus Newman\u2019s unbounded enthusiasm for Wagner\u2019s music leads him to attach little or no importance to the composer\u2019s \u201cmaunderings.\u201d Yet though he seems quite sold on Wagner\u2019s personality, he does not permit his love to interfere with his superb and scholarly presentation of the evidence\u2014and thus he indirectly indicts his hero more forcibly than any less well documented accusation could. His picture of Nietzsche, on the other hand, is largely based on \u201cMr. Knight\u2019s valuable book\u201d and on Baumler\u2019s \u201cmasterly epitome of Nietzsche\u2019s thinking Der Philosoph und politiker.\u201d (this is Newman\u2019s paraphrase of Wagner\u2019s Religion and Art. The quote within the last quotation is from one of Wagner\u2019s letters to King Ludvig.) Alfred Baumler was the professor whom the National Socialists called to Berlin to \u201cinterpret\u201d Nietzsche. His exegetic principles\u2014including the premise that Nietzsche did not mean what he wrote in his books. ( Nietzsche, contrary to that meant everything he wrote and seriously and passionately.) Perhaps Baumler followed Nietzsche\u2019s sister, Elisabeth, in discounting the three works which were the fruit of Nietzsche\u2019s break with Wagner, i.e. Human, All-Too-Human, The Dawn, and The Joyful Science, as well as the two anti-Wagner polemics of 1888. That he accepted her edition of The Will to Power as Nietzsche\u2019s magnum opus; and that he may have approached Nietzsche with preconceived notions of National Socialism, and that he perhaps intended to read into Nietzsche\u2019s work. Newman, while not fond of National Socialism, takes Baumler\u2019s word for it that Nietzsche was perhaps pro The Third Reich (Nietzsche was basically anti-political)\u2014and concludes \u201cCould fifty Wagners have led the nation into worse disasters than one Nietzsche has done? The Fuhrer, of course, knew fifty times as much about Wagner as he did not about Nietzsche, and Wagner\u2019s essays, unlike Nietzsche\u2019s, did not have to be expurgated before being used in schools. One is reminded that another English Wagner enthusiast, a generation ago, also considered Bayreuth the greatest of all monuments of German art and culture, moved there after Wagner\u2019s death, asked Frau Cosima for the hand of Wagner\u2019s daughter, married her, and was entrusted by the Frau\u2019s Meisterin with the task of propagating Wagner\u2019s heritage. This was Huston Stuart Chamberlain, who preached the gospel of Teutonism and a new \u201cAryan\u201d Christianity, and who believed that the Christian opponent of Judaism has but two alternatives: to de-Judaize Jesus of Nazareth or to deny him. Chamberlain, following many theologians of middle Europe in the 19th century, attempted to prove that Jesus was an Aryan living in an isolated area of Gallilee, in Palestine, and separated racially racially from the rest of the people of the region. He also wrote The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century which attempted to show that an isolated group of Nordics has been cut off from the mainstream of the nation, and that Jesus was descended from such people. Field Marshal Ludendorf and others merely denied the relevance of Jesus, and were anti-Christian as well as anti-Hebrew, for they abominated the \u201cfruitless and self-defeating spirit of Hebraic revenge\u201d attributing to the ressentiment (Nietzsche\u2019s French term for resentment of the slave morality). These two traditions accepted in common the idea that the Bible, Old and New Testaments alike, was literal history. Now it might seem that the real Wagner was perhaps as different from the Wagner legend as Nietzsche was from his. Thus Newman, Wagner\u2019s biographer who wrote The Life and Works of Richard Wagner, \u201cthe true founders of Wagnerism as a \u201cfaith,\u201d a religion, were Cosima and Huston Stuart Chamberlain.\u201d Yet no body has submitted more evidence to show how Wagner himself founded this faith than has Newman himself, and one fails to see how or in what respects the National Socialists altered this faith or disagreed with Wagner! That the music of Wagner is bold and daring and that it struck out into regions that the sentimentality of Donizetti and Bellini and the pallid classicism of Beethoven and Bach had not approached. In Wagner Nietzsche saw a man of colossal originality and sublime courage, who thought for himself and had skill at making his ideas comprehensible to others. And, that the opera of the past had been a mere potpourri of songs, strung together upon a filament of banal recitative. The opera of Wagner is a symmetrical and homogeneous whole, in which the music is the music was unthinkable without the poetry and the poetry impossible without the music. All this Nietzsche recognized, and that Wagner was a genius is a completely different matter. It may seem idle to attach so much importance to Nietzsche\u2019s break with Wagner, but no other episode in Nietzsche\u2019s life has excited more public interest and comment; Nietzsche devoted two books to Wagner; and their break illuminates Nietzsche\u2019s thought and his historical position. Before long, Nietzsche was once more confronted with a man who, owing to his lack of genius, was an even more typical proto National Socialism than Wagner. That was Dr. Bernhard Forster, a leading anti-Semite German, who was married to Nietzsche\u2019s sister, Elisabeth, and who Nietzsche was not enthusiastic about. Nietzsche\u2019s relation to his sister always evidence a powerful ambivalence. It is conceivable that his passionate love of her as a boy had something to do with his later remarks: \u201cTo Byron\u2019s Manfred I must be profoundly related: I found all these abysses in myself\u2014at thirteen, I was ripe for this work\u201d [Ecce Homo II 4]. His love however, alternated with a dislike perhaps no less passionate. As in the case of Wagner, Nietzsche came to wonder if her character and outlook were basically opposed to what he wanted his own to be. Yet even though she somehow embodied a narrowness, and the deeply unchristian Christianity which he loathed. However, she loved him devotedly and had faith in him for a long time. That was more than he experienced from any other woman and therefore humanly more important to him than the thought that she may have been perhaps unable to understand or follow his ideas. \u201cWhat does he know of love who did not have to despise just what he loved!\u201d [Zarathustra, Part I, 17]. As I said, in 1885, his sister was married to Bernhard Foster, a prominent leader of the German anti-Semitic movement which Nietzsche abhorred. His contempt for anti-Semitism was not prompted by the man who took his sister away from him. Nietzsche\u2019s position had been established unmistakably about the time of his breach with Wagner, and Human, All-Too-Human (1878) leaves no doubt about it. Foster\u2019s ideology, briefly comprised \u201cpartly racial notions of Gobinneau\u2019s received second-hand from Wagner. . . partly Foster\u2019s own conceptions, such as\u2026the notion of Christ as Aryan with which he secures for himself the honor of having been the predecessor of H. St. Chamberlain, Julies Langbehn, and Ernest Haeckel\u2026\u201d Christ appeared among the Jews\u2014to cite Forster himself\u2014because \u201con the dark background of the most depraved of all nations, the bright figure of the Savior of the world would stand out the more impressively.\u201d And \u201cin the emphasis on the special predestination of the religious make-up of the Teutonic tribes for Christianity, Foster could scarcely satisfy himself. At the same time, however, he thought with sorrow and not without consciousness of sin of the faithlessly abandoned cult of Wotan\u201d [Podach, Gestaltem um Nietzsche, 134 f.]. (It was something similar after WWI to the Zionist sentiments echoed by Zionist Jews like Herzl, Nordeau, and Weizmann etc. voicing racial discrimination against Arab Palestine, who were looked by Herzl and his entourage in Palestine as sub-humans!). Nietzsche, on the other hand, had written even before his sister fell in love with Forster: \u201cIf one wants to claim that the Teuton was performed and predestined for Christianity, one must not lack impertinence\u201d: he had called \u201cJesus [whom he respected without believing in the incarnation and Saul (St. Paul) the two most Jewish Jews perhaps who ever lived\u201d; and he had insisted that \u201cChristianity issued from Judaism\u201d (Nietzsche\u2019s works xi, 73). Thus, the contrast with Forster speaks for itself. Nevertheless, Forster\u2014typically in this respect, too\u2014admired Nietzsche. ",

            "answer_text": "It is officailly known that Nietzsche\u2019s thought of Wagner had been changed. Wagner\u2019s music wasn\u2019t what Nietzsche believed at the biggining of their relationship(on the Nietzche\u2019s view point). Nietzche, at the begginig, believed that Wagners music was kind of the \u2018dionysosian\u2019 which is distinguished from the \u2018apollonian\u2019 that can be generalized or universalized. It really impressed Nietzche. It is because one of the main Idea of Nietzche is to be special for oneself, not to look around to be generallized. This point of view on Wagner, however, changed. Nietzsche thought that Wager\u2019s music is focusing on the public to amuse them. For Nietzsche, Wagner\u2019s work wasn\u2019t origiative anymore. Whether his point on Wagner\u2019s work was right or not, he couln\u2019t take the relationships anymore. This is the stroy officially known. May be we should listen Wagner\u2019s work, and consider that Nietzsche\u2019s jugment was right or not. But I think It won\u2019t enough to understand their relationship. Because, I think there would be more personal struggles that we cannot know exactly. It is because, I believe that people cannot cut off their relationship only for the conflict between their ideology. ",
