            "answer_text": "I moved to Toronto, ON in March 2018 from Mumbai, India. I had a few years of film, television and commercials production experience from my time in India. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that the film and television production business here in Ontario is in great shape and expected to only do better in the foreseeable future with the support of the provincial government. The industry itself is predominantly very professional and well organised. It took me a year or so to figure out how the different parts of the business are run differently\u2026 for example, most major film and tv productions are only union shows which means u have to be a member or at least a provisional member to work on them but the tv commercials, documentary and music video world is not union run. Having said that, the tv commercials producers have their own lil industry group that works together to standardise rates and production rules to ensure uniformity across the business. All said, the film, tv and commercials industry here in Toronto is doing well and is expected to grow. A fair indicator of that is the massive investment made in multiple new studios across Toronto by companies like Whites, Netflix, CBS, etc. Covid may mean things are quiet but soon as things are safe to go I expect there will be a fair demand for qualified film professionals here in Toronto.

            "answer_text": "Hi Uchenna. I agree with Daisy. There is a large industry in Canada making films and TV series for the United States market. They do it by disguising principally Toronto and Vancouver as various US cities. Also, they use the countryside north of Vancouver to represent various places in the United States Pacific Northwest. So many of these productions are made in Canada because it is cheaper here. The Canadian film industry is unionized but they don\u2019t attempt to demand Hollywood-level salaries. In addition to shooting films on sets here a lot of other production work is done. There is a lot of technical work. Good luck. I hope you find the opportunities you are looking for. Martin ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely. Canada is truly a land of opportunity for immigrants. People who are willing to work for their dreams (and have the requisite skills) have great potential of achieving them. A close friend of mine immigrated to Canada in high school. Two years after graduating university, she\u2019s now employed in a great role at TIFF (the Toronto International Film Festival). Canada also has a sizeable number of cultural film festivals and funding available. ",
