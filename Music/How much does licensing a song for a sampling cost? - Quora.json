            "answer_text": "I would ask yourself a few questions. **** Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. A) Do you honestly expect yourself to profit from this sampling? B) Do you really think the artist in question will even notice you? C) Do you think they will care? D) Are you trying to steal their work? Have you ever watched Youtube videos of remixes of songs by pop stars like Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake? Some DJs have made a name for themselves this way. The artists don\u2019t care\u2026 it\u2019s free promotion and helps reach an audience they might not normally reach. It makes them seem cool. I believe Lady Gaga has even released a compilation of unsolicited remixes of her songs. Some people are cool like that. Even arseholes like Metallica, who used to brag about how \u2018tape sharing\u2019 built their fan base but then, when they became pop stars, started suing bootleggers\u2026 if you aren\u2019t making money off the song, the most they can do is have their lawyers send you a \u2018cease and desist\u2019 letter. They can\u2019t sue you for money they lost if you didn\u2019t make any money. **** Again: Not a lawyer. But there\u2019s the common sense rules. Is your sample a tribute or an attempt to fool people into thinking you came up with a certain guitar riff? Are you trying to get rich off someone else\u2019s artistic work? If not, I imagine you\u2019ll be good. But for more information\u2026 How Long Can a Sample Be Before You Need Copyright Permission? Just remember to credit them in the liner notes. 8 ) ",

            "answer_text": "Sample licenses cost anywhere from nothing to $100,000 or more. It depends on the sample source, how well known it is, what your planned usage is, and a million other factors. Unfortunately, there is no standardized pricing scheme or public listing of past license deals. Every sample license gets negotiated in private from scratch. The best thing to do is consult a sample clearance service or entertainment lawyer and try to get an estimate. Or you can try sending an email to the record label and ask. ",
