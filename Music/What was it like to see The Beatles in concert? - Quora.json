            "answer_text": "Yes, I have been to a Beatles concert. I saw The Beatles at the Shea Stadium Concert of August 15, 1965. I had to look up the specific day because I did not remember. I am going to be as honest as possible from what I can recall. It\u2019s important for me to do it as much from memory because I just turned 69 this past Friday (2 days ago). So born October 19th, 1949 that would have made me 15 at that date in August of 1965. My best friend was Johnny C. who lived 2 doors down from where my Irish family and I lived. I was the baby of 7 kids! When The Beatles first hit on the radio, followed by Ed Sullivan on Black and White TV, and then they were placing like 5 songs in the top 10, Johnny and I were all things Beatles. He was the oldest of 2 kids from an Italian family (I was always staying and eating there during the summer if I was allowed) and it was less hectic so we used to listen to the record player up in his bedroom (I was jealous he had his own bedroom) and play The Beatles Albums we had at that point until we were told I had to go home as it was getting late (like 8pm). The American Albums were released differently so I remember Meet The Beatles and The Beatles 2nd Album as being what we first had and A Hard Days Night. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m taking a slow approach. It naturally brings back memories. Johnny\u2019s Dad was a New York City detective with connections (I found out later). I remember being told to ask my parents could I go to see The Beatles at Shea Stadium. And that Mr. C would be escorting us. Not being allowed to grow my hair long and get Beatle boots, for Johnny and I, it might have been the end of the world (lol) if I could not go. In the end Mr. C spoke with my parents and I was allowed to go. I remember the anticipation was crazy. The day finally arrived. We saw that we would be sitting pretty far back on the first level, but had a clear view. I do not honestly remember every detail of getting to the Stadium other than we were driven by Mr. C. I know getting to our seats seemed endless and being 15 we were inpatient and irritable with the crowd already being nuts. There had been rumors even before going to the Stadium that The Beatles were going to arrive by helicopter and land just behind 2nd base where the stage was set up. I still to this day do not understand why there were numerous \u201cfalse alarm\u201d helicopters that flew above the Stadium coming in from the outfield as if the rumor was going to be true until it veered off. Now that I\u2019m older of course I realize probably Security or decoy? Every single time that happened the crowd (I have to say it seemed there was probably a 10 to 1 ratio of young girls to young men) went BONKERS! A level of noise I had never heard and have never heard since. And I have been to many concerts over the years. After what felt like a lifelong wait, they were announced (without looking it up I couldn\u2019t say who announced them, don\u2019t remember! ). Off the top of my head I\u2019d say Ed Sullivan or Murray the K (NYC disc jockey who promoted himself I might add as the 5th Beatle because of all the interviews he got with them). They took the field coming from the 3rd base side walking across the infield and climbing to the raised stage at 2nd base. Unbelievably awesome to see my HEROES, my everything in life. From that point on it was screaming at a decibel so unearthly that not one song did I hear, not one comment from them did I hear. Completely drowned out. It was INCREDIBLE to see them, but I was frustrated at not being able to hear them at all. It seemed they were there and then they were gone. A 30 minute concert. I\u2019m not sure that by the time Johnny and I left with his Dad that we knew what happened. I can recalll now as I\u2019m writing that Mr. C kept asking how we enjoyed it and neither one of us could answer very much. We sat silently all the way home. I remember after that Johnny telling me he was now into The Rolling Stones. I did feel betrayed. I still loved every Beatles album that came out, but the Mania changed everything as far as a fan being able to know what song they were even singing. And a year later the Shea 1966 concert did not sell out and shortly after that they stopped touring. In reality The Beatles as far as being a live act (after hitting it big in America) was really a very fast and short lived phenomenon. My brother that Christmas of 1965 bought me a Bob Dylan album. Highway 61 ? I also ended up getting into the Stones etc etc. I remember being initially confused by Rubber Soul when it first came out. Very different. What\u2019s going on? The Beatles were now going in a different direction. But one can only imagine how The Beatles (who were the ones onstage not hearing themselves) eventually must have felt about touring? And we have all come to know that indeed became an issue as far as the NOISE. Ringo has said it even hindered them as musicians. On size alone, the crowds were AWESOME. No one had done Stadiums to that point. But that would change. Not being able to hear the songs was not so Awesome. In ending, I have remained on a Beatles path the rest of my life and have obsorbed every Album, book, written article. And I now realize how lucky I was to have experienced Shea Stadium and The Beatles even though this answer in some ways is not as Sexy and Glamorous as maybe some might have wanted it to be. But it\u2019s honest and describes what it was like, at least for me. Everything happened so fast it was almost like it didn\u2019t happen. I hope I\u2019m explaining it right so people can understand. But anyway when all is said and done, I love The Beatles to death, always have and always will. ",

            "answer_text": "I did see them at Shea Stadium, must have been 1966 because I was eighteen, and working at a famous bar called Maxes Kansas City, a restaurant on Park Avenue South at Fourteenth Street where people said folks like Warhol and the Stones would come, when I wasn\u2019t at work of course. I was a bus boy, visiting my dad in New York for the summer and feeling like I had a lot of money for the first time in my life, ah the illusions of youth. So I took my dad because I didn\u2019t know anyone else to take. I recall the tickets seemed cheap, like around $7 or so each. We took the subway out to Flushing and there, among fourteen thousand twelve year old girls who were all screaming at the same time and waving signs they\u2019d made saying \u201cPaul I love you!\u201d, we did in fact \u201csee\u201d the Beatles. You could barely hear anything on the PA system there was so much noise! I forget who was the warm up act, but the Beatles arrived via a limo that drove them out to the stage in the middle of the field, about a quarter of a mile away. They played some songs and then jumped back in the car and drove away again. I could vaguely recognize the songs they played, I liked them quite a lot and bought a lot of their albums, but this was far from an optimal situation musically speaking. My dad and I laughed at the absurdity of the situation and when it was over we left with the crowd. On the way out I bought a poster that had been taken from the cover of their first US \u201cgreatest hits\u201d album, the one that had originally had them in butchers smocks with pieces of meat and blood on them, with big smiles. Under the picture it says \u201cOUTRAGEOUS\u201d. The album cover was then pulled by the record company. I was disgusted with the power play of the record company execs who tried to dictate taste, and amused that they would pose for such an English and outrageous joke. I still have that souvenir, probably worth a few bucks. Funny memory: in the twilight, looking out past the baseball field across the industrial landscape was a neon sign with a zipper going up and down, from some industrial zipper company. Being a teenager growing up in Berkeley I went to a lot of concerts in the sixties, mostly in San Francisco at the Filmore Auditorium, in Berkeley and at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. The first Bob Dylan concert in Berkeley around 1964 was one of the best, people stayed in their seats and behaved, no screaming, no interrupting with applause, you could actually HEAR the music. I got disgusted and stopped going to many shows by the late sixties and early seventies. At the Winterland concerts in the early seventies I finally quit going because there were so many badly behaved people on drugs or drunk (and I was a drug user myself at the time) that I just didn\u2019t like the experience anymore and preferred to stay home and actually hear what the musicians intended I hear.
