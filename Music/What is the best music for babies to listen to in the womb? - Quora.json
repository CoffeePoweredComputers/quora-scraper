            "answer_text": "I believe that babies can hear extremely well when in the womb. Seemingly they can actually pick up an accent, the mother's accent, so they can hear lots of outside noises. I don't think a baby has the cognitive ability to understand Bach or Mozart so I would guess that simple melodies would be great. Happy or sad? I think both have their place but simple would be the main thing. My Dad played Mozart for me whilst I was in utero and I'm a professional musician but I'm sure this is just coincidence. ",
