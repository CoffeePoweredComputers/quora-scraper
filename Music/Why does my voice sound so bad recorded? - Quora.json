Two things: As has been explained, no one else is capable of hearing you the way you do. You, however, can hear what we hear when you listen to a recording.Learn this very quickly: your feelings almost always lie to you. (This is really more of a philosophical matter.) We are, almost all of us, given to dislike the actual sound we emit. But how you feel is simply how you feel. It is not a truth coded in your DNA (and, hence, how you actually sound) or anything. You almost certainly have a different opinion about your voice than anyone else. So find someone who has no reason to lie to you (unlike your feelings, which will tell you anything to protect you from some imagined future embarrassment) and listen to them.",

            "answer_text": "It's because you're not used to hearing your voice the way other people do. When you speak, you hear your voice as it comes out of you. This is affected by your nasal passages, as well as the vibration in your head from your voice coming out. So while you might think you're hearing your own voice, what you're really hearing is your voice after it has passed through your head which makes it sound very different. When you hear your voice on a recording, you're hearing it as other people do, without all the reverb that your head normally puts on it. You recognize it as your own voice, but it's slightly different, which makes it uncanny. While it may be a perfectly fine, attractive voice, it sounds terrible to you because it's just slightly different from what you're used to hearing so it seems hollow and simply wrong. ",
