            "answer_text": "Have you noticed that you have a tightness in your throat when you are singing. You are nervous and holding back your voice. (I've done my share of public speaking in public singing.) To get over this, go into a practice room and start by shouting the lyrics of the song you want to sing. Don't worry about making it sound melodic. Just drive the sound out of your mouth using your diaphragm as loud as possible. To really shout, you have to push air from your diaphragm and open your mouth. You should be doing that when you sing. Once you are able to shout all of the lyrics, then start throttling it back and work on adding the melody. Now, imagine yourself standing on a concert stage absolutely naked . . . (Oh wait, wait, don't do that.) Well, you could do that until you feel comfortable standing there shouting \u2013 singing. (Learn to laugh and not take it seriously.) Otherwise, try picturing yourself standing in a field with no one around you for miles. Don't worry about the audience, just focus on the beauty around you, the beauty of the music, and the deep meaning you are trying to convey with the lyrics. Let it out and sing with joy. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three basic causes for this: lack of support, airflow, and resonance. Support: you're breathing wrong. Yeah, I know you've been doing it all your life. But for good volume when singing, you have to drive your inhalation and exhalation from your diaphragm muscle, at the bottom of your ribcage. Airflow: you're restricting the diameter of the tubes the air is flowing through carrying the sound out, probably by tensing your throat muscles and closing your epiglottis. Resonance: full, solid tones require constructive interference as sound reverberates through open space in your chest cavity and head. You're not letting the sound pass through spaces best sized for the wavelength of the note you're singing. How to fix? Best bet is to get a singing teacher, or at least someone who has had professional instruction, watch and listen to you to identify the specific issues with your singing and give you pointers. ",
