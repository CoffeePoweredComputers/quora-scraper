            "answer_text": "Peak levels (which I assume is what you mean by \u201cdB level\u201d) don\u2019t really matter. The main thing you need to worry about is RMS (\u201cRoot Mean Square\u201d) loudness levels. Loudness is a more accurate way of measuring volume that relates to the way our ears hear sound. A sound with a high transient peak level won\u2019t sound as loud to us as a sound that maintains at that peak level over a long period of time. That\u2019s what RMS levels measure. Generally you want the master level of the mix to be between -8 and -14dB RMS. You\u2019ll want to build the mix around that, but generally you want at least 6dB RMS of separation between the vocals and other parts of the mix to ensure clarity. ",

            "answer_text": "The levels on the output are set in post production but the level at which they are recorded must be clear. dB of around 75 is room - normal noises, a live band usually is about 100\u2013110. Point of pain is about 125\u2013150dB such as blaring megaphone political rallies or an expansion chamber on a racing grand prix motor cycle. I suggest you set your levels on your recording devices about mid to 75% and watch the peak indicators so that any loud sounds don\u2019t peak. The editors and post sound mixers will do the rest. ",
