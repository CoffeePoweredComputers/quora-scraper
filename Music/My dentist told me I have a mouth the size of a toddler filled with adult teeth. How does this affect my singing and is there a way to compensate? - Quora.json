            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been singing for 30 years. I\u2019ve also had a multitude of dental health professionals tell me that I own the biggest teeth they\u2019ve ever seen. To date, I have the biggest teeth that I\u2019ve ever seen. I also had an underdeveloped lower jaw, which compounded the large teeth problem and led to a crowded mouth and an unsightly overbite. I did not have difficulty with pitch, and it was long enough ago that I couldn\u2019t say whether it adversely affected my resonance. I did have difficulty with pronunciation, and also with getting dates and chewing food properly. Dentists and orthodontists did what they could. Removing my four wisdom teeth as well as two more lower adult teeth helped, but this was not enough. The final resolution in my case was corrective jaw surgery. While I was sedated, an oral surgeon broke my mandible on both sides at an angle so that it could be slid forward, effectively increasing the length. Pairs of steel pins were drilled through the bone from small incisions along my jawline to hold the jaw in place so it could heal properly in its new position. The results were transformative. After an uncomfortable recovery process, the functionality and aesthetics of my jaw were much improved. Please take my experiences with a grain of salt, as your situation may be completely different. Do you know why you \u201chave a mouth the size of a toddler\u201d? Did your dentist offer any suggestions on how to address this? How serious do you feel your overcrowded mouth is? Are you still growing? ",

            "answer_text": "You have a mouth the size of a toddler filled with adult teeth and you are wondering how it could affect your singing. I\u2019ve been teaching singers for 45 years and have had only one student whose crowded teeth affected her singing. No matter how hard she worked you could not understand what she was saying. Unfortunately, her parents (who could take her) wouldn\u2019t take her an orthodontist for an evaluation even though she was maybe 14. On the upside, her placement. tone, and resonance what terrific. She was an amazingly quick student - three lessons in she understood the concepts of placement, of registers. So her teeth did no affect the production of her sound - but her diction, no matter how hard she worked, was unintelligible. And the poor kid worked so hard. Have you experienced problems with your diction? Or, for that matter, the production of your sound? If the answer to the first question is yes and to the second is no, if it were me, I\u2019d have my dentist recommend an evaluation with an orthodontist and see what that doctor says. It really boils do how committed you are to your singing (and if you can work something do-able with an orthodontist. ",
