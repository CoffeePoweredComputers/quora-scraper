            "answer_text": "10 best music streaming apps and music streaming services for Android!  Since its inception, music streaming has grown tremendously and is now among the best ways to listen to music. Most music platforms encourage you to listen free of charge, which has helped reduce the need for piracy because musicians are also getting at least a little for their work. With a lot of options, it's conveniently available too. If you're in hunting to stream some music, here are Android 's best music streaming apps and music streaming services! Apple Music Apple Music exploded to mixed reviews on stage in late 2015. It's quickly become one of the better online music applications out there, though. It includes 30 million songs along with playlists, a 24/7 live radio, and you can upload and stream your music to your device. Also, there is a social component where you can follow artists and see what they are up to. It has a variety of monthly plans including individual plans, a cheaper student plan, and a family plan which supports up to six members of the family. This is also correcting a lot of the early glitches and problems. What it lacks in features, in many countries where many of those other services are not available, it makes up for in availability. Students receive a 50 percent discount ($4.99 a month) while family plans max at $14.99 a month. That is really efficient pricing. Deezer Deezer does have ups and downs. It's one of the most reputable streaming platforms though. It provides the normal collection of apps such as playlists, channels, reviews, and a personal music app, Flow. In more countries, it still sells 43 million tracks than other rivals did. Perhaps the best feature will be a 16-bit FLAC standard Hi-Fi streaming service for $19.99 a month. Which gives Tidal some Hi-Fi streaming space to compete. However, those who are not looking for a Hi-Fi experience do have better options for casual listening. So opt with the high-quality material or go somewhere else. iHeartRadio Long time fan is iHeartRadio. If it comes to selected playlists and radio stations it is among the best. The service also boasts a premium music service with millions of tracks on demand. That's a powerful one-two punch to it. Its selections for radio are much better than most competitors. The $4.99 edition provides audio streaming on-demand while $9.99 includes a lot of extra features. It is truly not a bad way to go, but there are other rivals who have a better range on sale. However, iHeartRadio will always be market champion for free radio stations. Pandora Pandora is one of the most popular and widely recognized streaming music apps ever. It is available on a ton of platforms which includes a few cars. There are two main experiences on Pandora. The first is a station-only radio service that lets you skip tracks and offer up or down thumbs to indicate whether you really like it. The second is a full digital on-demand service equivalent to Itunes, Apple Music, etc. Of note, the full on-demand package (at $9.99 a month) also contains all of the free Pandora apps. This is a great choice if you are already using Pandora or want something with playlists on above-average radio stations. SoundCloud SoundCloud is also another incredibly popular listening site for music. It is useful all over the world to indie creators. For the joy of others, lots of people post their things for SoundCloud. SoundCloud Go, the on-demand service offered by SoundCloud, brings tens of millions of popular tracks to this blend. The total available tracks amount to over 150 million for $9.99 per month. That's the second-biggest music library (technically seeing both of Google Play Music and YouTube Red together). This is a great place to discover indie stuff that nobody else knows. In addition, the service includes the usual things such as playlists, stations, and other discovery features. Spotify Spotify is among the most recognizable streaming music apps in the world. With tens of millions of songs, playlists, podcasts, curated radio stations, and even some video content, it features a rock-solid experience complete. Only the potent YouTube Red and Google Play Music combo has better overall video and audio content selection. Spotify is available on tons of platforms, is rock solid, and it's available throughout the world in many places. Plus, the premium edition is significantly better than other rivals. Many music listening services are available that are well in some ways but poorly in others. Spotify does everything well though, which is why it is popular. If you want to experience the service in other ways, you can try Spotify Stations too. TIDAL TIDAL markets itself as a channel to artists streaming songs. It boasts over 48.5 million tracks, support in dozens of countries, and over a dozen musicians and entertainers ownership groups. Any other options include 16-bit, high-quality CD ($19.99 a month), support for Android TV, selected playlists, an official music blog, and over 130,000 music videos. Competitors have more apps and gimmicks, in general. TIDAL certainly does, though, do more for professional music lovers than casual audiences. This and Deezer also remain the only two decent options for audiophiles. TuneIn Radio In the music streaming space, TuneIn is a bit of a wild card. It doesn't have the popular features like music content on-demand. However, by having metric loads of radio shows, podcasts, and even live sports (in the premium edition, anyway), it compensates for this. This covers AM and FM stations, 600 free commercial (premium edition only) stations, plus 100,000 other stations. If you can't find a good radio station here then there probably isn't. We can only recommend this one to people who enjoy live sports, podcasts and talk radio as well, however. Otherwise, a different app on the list might better serve you. YouTube Music YouTube Music is the main music service currently provided by Google. For a subscription service, it operates reasonably well. You are having access to the same hundreds of millions of tracks as every other music site. This one still tracks YouTube itself, though, and this gives it the edge when it comes to music choices. The app is a bit barebones but it launches fairly consistently with new features. The app ultimately overtakes Google Play Music, and most of the features of Google Play Music are migrated to the current service until it shuts down. Home server music apps Anyone with wide libraries of local music will also watch the songs. Google Play Music and Apple Music let you upload music to their servers. You can, indeed, create your own server too. A variety of applications are available to do so, includes Subsonic (includes DSub), Plex (linked), and a few others. You are effectively running a server on your computer. It transfers the files to your computer, and the music is played back by your computers. It's a sleek and outdated way of downloading music but it's also highly successful and convenient for people with high-quality, wide libraries of music and those who don't want to pay subscription rates. Only the home server applications cost a few bucks but that's basically it. Please Upvote if found helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean technical measurement like bit rate and sampling rate it is Tidal. With an MQA Decoder I am Regularly listening to music as high as 192/24 bit. CD recording quality of 44.1/16 bit is the lowest you will find on Tidal HiFi. Through good equipment with a good recording high bit rate music sounds amazing. Anyone that tells you different either has not heard it (most likely), has bad equipment or tin ears. ",
