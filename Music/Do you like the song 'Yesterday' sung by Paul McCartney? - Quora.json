He dreamt of the song/ melody and woke up with it, humming it for days, playing it for his band mates and others asking if they knew the name of a song like it! He had scrambled eggs instead of Yesterday as the title. You know, like scrambled eggs, how I really love those scrambled eggs, which he turned into, Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away, much better! But, it was and still is one of his best songs ever! At some point in all our lives, we think our Yesterday\u2019s had fewer problems! YES! IT IS A SONG I LOVE! ",

It has been covered by many artists including Frank Sinatra, Elvis, Liberace, Joan Baez, Boyz II Men and others and is the most covered song in music history! (3000 versions recorded to date.) \u201cYesterday\u201d was conceived in a dream and was originally called,\u201d Scrambled Eggs.\u201d He had the tune in his head and after a much longer time than usual, working on \u201cYesterday\u201d, and driving everyone crazy, he finally finished it. He considered \u201cYesterday\u201d to be his best song. ",

            "answer_text": "Of Course!!! It is a classic. But it is a bit brief. I think Paul said he should have added a few more lyrics to it. I can\u2019t argue that it was a success and is a beautiful song. It leaves me wanting a little more. Perhaps that is for the best though! To be honest, I do prefer some of his other songs to it. For No One, Hey Jude, Here There and Everywhere from his Beatles years & Maybe I\u2019m Amazed, Another Day, The entire Band On The Run Album and Silly Love Songs among others are better in my opinion. Paul has written so many fantastic songs! I could easily add more to that list! ",
