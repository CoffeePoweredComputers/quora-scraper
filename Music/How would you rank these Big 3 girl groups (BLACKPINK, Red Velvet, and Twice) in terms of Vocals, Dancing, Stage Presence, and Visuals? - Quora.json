            "answer_text": "Hopefully I don\u2019t get hated on. I don\u2019t disrespect or hate on any groups, but I do have my opinions about them, whether they may be negative or positive, and if you can\u2019t be respectful about what I have to say, then you better scroll.  Vocals: Red Velvet: I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t have to explain this one.Twice: Jihyo, Nayeon, and Jeongyeon are very strong vocalists, as well as decent vocalists such as Mina, Sana, and recently Tzuyu. In More and More the rapline + Tzuyu blew me away with their improvement in their verses.Blackpink isn\u2019t bad, but Rose and Jisoo aren\u2019t as strong as the other main and lead vocals on this list. Jennie isn\u2019t bad, and I personally love her tone, but I can\u2019t call her a more talented vocalist than the other vocalists.Dancing: Twice: Their choreos have only gotten better as the years have gone on and they are all in sync. There\u2019s Momo and Mina, and then there are so many members that have the potential to be lead dancers. You have Nayeon, Sana, Tzuyu, and Jihyo, who have all be praised for their dancing improvement. When they\u2019re performing together, I can\u2019t see any weak spots or a lot of mistakes.Red Velvet: Though their choreos aren\u2019t particularly hard, they are very organized and fun to watch. All five members do lots of different concepts resulting in very different dances, which is very interesting! Seulgi and Irene demonstrated incredibly difficult choreo in their sub-unit, probably the hardest choreo of all the groups on this list, but they are main and lead dancer. As a group there aren\u2019t any glaring problems.Blackpink, again aren\u2019t bad, but they all dance at different intensities sometimes. If you asked this question in 2016\u20132017, my answer may have been different, but as of now, choreos aren\u2019t particularity imaginative nor are they eye-catching. However, they don\u2019t really have any bad dancers, they just don\u2019t really stand out as a group.Stage Presence: Twice: They all seem to be into the performance at all times, and that immediately makes it more enjoyable for me as the audience to see them giving it there all and delivering great performances.Blackpink: They run hot and cold. Yes I saw Coachella. No that doesn\u2019t define them as a group. They seem to give it their all in some, and nothing in others. But lately they seem to be getting better, but the debut spark is gone.Red Velvet: Honestly when it comes to interacting, hyping, and drawing the audience in, Red Velvet isn\u2019t very good at those things. Wendy probably the best performer, but Seulgi and Joy aren\u2019t that bad, nor are Irene and Yeri.Visuals: I\u2019m going to do it individually based on my preferences because I know the basics of Korean standards, but I don\u2019t wanna make any mistakes. Irene - I\u2019m a sucker for the original visual. 2. Jisoo - My bias keeps bias wrecking me. But i\u2019m okay with it ;)  3. Jeongyeon - Imo she\u2019s probably the most suited to be a model on this list.  4. Jennie - One minute i\u2019m calling her cute, the next i\u2019m telling her to step on me.  5. Wendy: Short hair Wendy is IT.  6. Dahyun - Whoever took this picture is so lucky.  7. Tzuyu - AJkdljfalskhuhiornfvdivfjnhskjfvlka - shit  8. Seulgi - Life\u2019s unfair sometimes.  9. Jihyo - God Jihyo is honestly another level.  10. Sana - Her visuals added like 20 years to my life.  11. Rose(where the frick is the accent mark) - Stop it (don\u2019t stop actually)  12. Joy - We all know this one  13. Momo: Her look keeps getting better and better.  14. Chaeyoung: Long black hair is superior.  15 Mina - Her visuals are super elegant.  16. Nayeon: I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s just not my favorite visual. But she super pretty <3  17. Yeri - I feel so bad because she\u2019s my bias-wrecker, but I bias her for other things.  18. Lisa - Oml I so admire and respect her, but her visuals aren\u2019t for me :(  I know this might not be what everyone\u2019s thinking, but please stay respectful. Tell me if you wanna see rap, i\u2019m running out of time rn. Sorry for any grammar/spelling errors. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m so bored and this was requested. Vocals Red Velvet - Easy answer. Wendy is an amazing vocalist and is the best singer out of these 3 girl groups. Seulgi is also really good along with Joy. Even Irene and Yeri can sing.Twice - Jeongyeon has such a beautiful voice. Jihyo does too. I think they\u2019re stable most of the time. I feel like Momo would make a better rapper personally.Blackpink - They\u2019re stable half of the time. Ros\u00e9 is a pretty good vocalist but she can use some improvement. Jisoo has had a lot of improvement over the years. Jennie tends to yell more than sing sometimes. They have good voices though.Dancing Twice - JYPE is known for having good dancers. Momo and Mina are amazing dancers. None of the members are bad at dancing and I generally enjoy watching them dance.Blackpink - Lisa is a very talented dancer and has good isolation. I think Rose and Jennie are average dancers and Jisoo is a bit below average. Jisoo has improved the most though and I think she\u2019ll continue to do so.Red Velvet - If this was based on main dancers alone, Red Velvet would be 1. Seulgi is so underhyped when she\u2019s one of the best female dancers. Overall though, Red Velvet could use a bit of work in the dancing area but they aren\u2019t that bad.Stage Presence Twice - They have really good stage presence. I enjoy watching their performances a lot. Momo and Jihyo\u2019s stage presence is amazing. They\u2019re pretty strong in this area.Blackpink - Lisa has the best stage presence and she\u2019s very entertaining to watch. Jennie\u2019s stage presence is only strong every once in a while, but it\u2019s normally kind of dull. Ros\u00e9 has okay stage presence but sometimes she pops off. Jisoo has regular stage presence I\u2019d say.Red Velvet - This is kind of a sore spot for them. Seulgi has really good stage presence but the other members can be a bit boring at times. They all have their moments though.Visuals Red Velvet - Yeri is the cutest person ever and the rest of them are so beautiful. Their visuals are my personal favorite.Twice - I really like their visuals. They\u2019re all so beautiful like wtf. They also have very unique visuals too.Blackpink - I really like Ros\u00e9\u2019s visuals. She literally glows. They have unique visuals too but I just prefer Twice and RV\u2019s visuals. They\u2019re all super pretty though.Yeah that\u2019s all. If there was another section for Rap then Blackpink would definitely take that spot. These are my own opinions though. ~Liz ",
