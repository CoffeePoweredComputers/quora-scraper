            "answer_text": "ORIGINAL QUESTION: \u201cCan I cover songs in YouTube because I don't understand this ?\u201d Alright. The way the question is worded is a bit vague, so it seems likely you\u2019re asking one of two things. The first is that you\u2019re essentially asking how to make cover music. I\u2019m not going to answer this one in detail at the moment as there is a LOT of material out there that is easy to approach, and laid out simply. The second option, however, is what I\u2019ll be focusing on, as it is VERY confusing, and took me quite a while to be clear on how it all worked. That is: MY REWORDED QUESTION: \u201cWhat are the rules and/or restrictions on making cover songs on YouTube (getting permissions) Copyright law is very confusing, and all over the place when it comes to YouTube and cover music, mainly because what it says and what is generally accepted are so different as to be laughable. There\u2019s quite a bit of information to cover, so I\u2019ll hit it point by point and try to have one single, cohesive answer.  THE LAW REGARDING A MECHANICAL LICENSE:There are two types of Copyright licenses that apply to cover music. First, there is a Mechanical License, which allows an artist to cover and distribute (sell) music digitally. This includes selling CDs, on Spotify, Pandora, etc. A Mechanical License is obtained by paying a certain fee to the Agency that releases the original music. Once paid, you are free to cover. It is pretty easy to obtain this, but more on that later.THE LAW REGARDING A SYNCHRONIZATION LICENSE:This is where things get tricky. According to law, if you are pairing the audio cover with video, and that means ANY video (You while singing, a Music Video, A pure black screen, anything), then you require a second type of license, the Synchronization License. This is were all the confusion comes from, because Publishers VERY rarely give these away, and technically EVERY YouTube cover needs one to be legal. However, because it\u2019s so hard to get, this law is mostly ignored and nobody really ever does anything about it. There are still some aspects that you REALLY need to remember, so let\u2019s get to that next.PRACTICAL APPLICATION - WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?Realistically, you really only need to do two things, Mark it as a cover of (original artist), and Do not monetize your videos. Technically, virtually every cover video on YouTube is illegal, but nobody really cares, since the covers ultimately help the original artist anyway, so they don\u2019t care as long as the cover artists aren\u2019t trying to make money. If all you want to do is create YouTube covers, and you don\u2019t want to make money, then that\u2019s it. You\u2019ll notice that it is EXTREMELY rare to find a YouTube cover that has ads on it, and this is why.BUT WHAT IF I WANT TO MAKE MONEY ON MY COVER SONGS?Don\u2019t worry! While it\u2019s practically impossible to obtain the rights to make money from your covers on YouTube, you can still make money in other ways:DONATIONS (Patreon, Gofundmet, etc.):Legally, if you use a crowd-sourcing platform, you aren\u2019t making money from the covers, and you\u2019re in the clear. In fact, you can even ask for donations at the end of your cover video and still be clear. This doesn\u2019t require any additional licenses, since people are just donating to you as an artist, and are not purchasing your covers from you. My guess is that in the next ten years or so, there will eventually be further legal restrictions placed on this method, but for now, you\u2019re in the clear.OBTAINING A MECHANICAL LICENSE AND SELLING:So you can\u2019t make money on your YouTube covers, but you can still sell the audio covers. All you have to do is obtain a Mechanical License, and then you\u2019re in the clear to put your music on Spotify, iTunes, Pandora, etc., and make money!Traditionally, this was difficult to obtain, since you had to contact the Publishing company, and work out a deal with them for each of the mediums you planned to distribute to, and you had to do this for each song you covered, which was a nightmare. Now, however, there is a much simpler method:USE A 3RD PARTY LICENSING COMPANY (Hassle-Free Selling):All you have to do to start legally selling your money is to find a 3rd party licensing company (Loudr, CDBaby, Tunecore, HFA, etc.), sign up with their service, and start selling your music. They already have existing deals with most Music Publishers, so you don\u2019t even have to go through a waiting process. All you have to do is upload your cover, select which song it is, and choose where to sell it (Spotify, iTunes, Amazon Prime Music, etc.). They will take a certain percentage of the profits, and the rest is yours. No hassle. That\u2019s about it. While the world of copyrights and music goes so much further, and has more rules if you want to perform a cover song publicly for money, distribute physical copies, etc. chances are you won\u2019t be needing to do that any time soon. Feel free to ask if you have any questions, and let me know if anything needs correcting. Thanks!

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can cover songs on YouTube. The best way for you to do this is by getting a simple, free video editor. For this purpose, I\u2019d recommend Windows Movie Maker which is free to download from the Microsoft Website. It really depends if you want to show your face in it. If you don\u2019t it\u2019s a whole lot easier. If you do it really depends on which options you choose. Here are the options. Playing music in the background while recording yourself.Open Movie Maker, and add the selected song into it. Then select record voice-over and record yourself. Note - You will not have your face in because it\u2019s a whole lot harder.Same as above, but you\u2019ll have to include a video of you.",
