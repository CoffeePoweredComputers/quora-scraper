            "answer_text": "Queen - Too Much Love Will Kill You (even on death's door, Freddie hit the nail right on the head). Journey - Faithfully, When You Love A Woman (in my case, you can replace the \u201cWoman\u201d with \u201cMan\u201d..yeah lol. Survivor - The Search Is Over Van Halen - Not Enough, When It's Love Whitney Houston - I Wanna Dance With Somebody, I Will Always Love You Paula Abdul - Rush Rush, Straight Up Dashboard Confessional - Vindicated. Brian McKnight - Back At One, Anytime, Win Steve Perry - Foolish Heart Peter Cetera - Glory Of Love As you can see here, the \u201ctheme\u201d is mostly sadness, because that's pretty much what I've been living the last 20+ years of my life, coming from a terribly abusive household, to being sent away when i was 14 because i couldn't be \u201ccontrolled\u201d any longer, to basically growing up in the mental health system. Hell, most, if not all of the people i have been in platonic relationships with, past, present and I'm sure the future, have been with people who also deal with some kind of mental health issue in their lives. People who have never dealt with what we have and will continue to deal with until our dying breaths, will never understand, until it happens to them. I lost my father in 1987, i believe i wasn't even a year old when he died in jail. He dealt with severe bipolar and depression issues, and was a huge drug addict and my mother maintains to this day he shot up months before he got locked up, then one night, they just found him..in the cell. Motionless. She said it was from AIDs symptoms. To this day, my father's death is the sole reason i will never go near that shit. Drugs almost killed my mother (funny, instead of killing her, they just made her batshit insane and delusional over the years, especially when It comes to myself and the 3 siblings.) They almost killed my brother, almost killed my uncle, and I'm sure they killed my aunt, before she even had a chance to live. Both Dad and Aunt Lisa are buried next to one another, i wanna say somewhere in Brooklyn. She was only 18, he was in his mid 30s. It's been a very long time since I've been up there. I have a lot of friends who are currently in recovery for drug and alcohol addictions. I had a friend recently, who i became extremely close with that somewhere along the way, i think (i THINK) I might have possibly developed some kind of crush on him.. (I'm super attracted to the funny, down to earth modest nerdy types.) He's the most genuine, sweet, kind, not to mention adorable, down to earth soul I've ever met. We had a falling out a month ago over stupid shit (my paranoia sometimes gets the better of me, as does my ego). We see each other every day, and i never intended to end it in the first place, i wasn't in a good frame of mind that week, and i almost lost it. Not at him. At life, in general. It fucking hurts, more than i ever thought it would, seeing each other every day and not being able to talk to each other. He's pissed off (and he has every right to be) but we look at one another so hard and we both can see the sadness in each other's faces. Richie and I hit it off mmediately when i arrived in the program in the summer of 16\u2032. (I think it's our mutual love for all things Pro Wrestling and 80s and Heavy Metal). My best friend from childhood, John passed away 5 years ago on May 24th in a fishing accident in the Hudson River. John was the only one i had when i was a kid to truly be myself around, considering the household itself was Insanity, and he was the only person i felt then that truly loved me. I feel to this day, John was always the only one. Ever since John died, I've been looking for someone to fill that \u201cbrother\u201d role, to fill the horrible void in my heart that John left behind. I made a friend while i was living in Buffalo in 2007 that i believe, was fate. We would have reached 10 years in September had we not literally imploded while i was visiting Buffalo for the first time since 2015. The entire \u201cvacation\u201d was a complete nightmare..i truly hope i never have to experience something like that ever again. Caitlin (the abovementioned best friend) while she was a huge factor in my learning how to be more independent, eat better, dress classier, she wasn't able to fill the brother role. Richie was. I haven't seen Caitlin since July. Richie i see every day. I took a risk and asked him if i could ask him a question. \u201cNo.\u201d. I just smiled, and said \u201cokay\u201d. I did this to myself, and I'm going to have to live with this. And I'm okay with that. They say time heals everything, and I'm going to pray to God that this doesn't end up being the end for us. He taught me a lot in just these last 5 months of spending time with he, his amazing girlfriend and their crazy but absolutely sweet dog and two cats. He taught me i need to laugh more, i need to smile more, and that i need to appreciate what and who i have around me who are the real ones. Not the ones who are only your \u201cfriend\u201d when they need something from you and AS as they get it, they're immediately AWOL until the next time. He taught me to be a better Santino than the Santino the day before. It's been a long fucking time since someone's affected me this deep. A VERY LONG TIME. This guy is the definition of class. Even when he's put into harsh situations, he always comes out with a smile on his face..its putting a smile on my face just thinking about the endless laughs we had together. Some of the best times i have ever had since i was a child. This world could stand to learn a thing or two from Richie. I have faith. I have to have faith. And lastly\u2026i put all of these songs on questions such as this because true love is something I've been after since i entered high school 16 years ago. Being a gay man, i find it hard for myself to impress anyone because i don't (or won't) meet some people's insane criterias for how a gay man should look (we all know the story). A year ago someone i talked to on Grindr asked me how much i weighed at the time and i said \u201c300 lbs\u201d and he literally shot me down immediately because i wasn't \u201cfat enough\u201d\u2026self esteem has been pretty much obsolete since that little convo. I get shit on because i don't drive a car, I'm not fat enough, I'm not skinny enough, or don't have millions upon millions in the bank. Also because I'd rather meet someone the traditional way by actually going on dates that don't end up with the bed drenched by the end of the night, dates that can actually entail the two parties to actually get to know one another. Truly get to know one another. I haven't been on a legitimate date since my initial date in 2006, with one of the sweetest men i have ever had the pleasure of knowing. It was my very first date, and i was so awkward, it was ridiculous. But he just giggled the entire time and walked me through the entire thing and really helped me ease up a little bit. Can't believe that was 12 years ago. He's still one of my best friends, we keep in touch via Facebook on occasion. But yeah..i haven't had luck in intimate relationships. Aside from Hector, I've only had 3 of them, and the 3 of them were proven to be batshit crazy and gold diggers. Hector was the only one who treated me like a human being, he always treats me with the utmost respect, instead of trash because i ain't trying to be someone who gets thrown to the side for the next guy until it's time for round 2. Sorry, i like to get to know people before i think about dating them. I just wonder if the saying of \u201cThere's somebody out there for everybody\u201d, i wonder if it's really true. It would be a nice change for once to wake up to someone or something that isn't my pillow, lmao. Everything happens for a reason, right? Time heals all wounds, right? I hope. I really hope. Buenos Noches, familia. ",

            "answer_text": "Where Have All The Flowers Gone? by Peter, Paul, and Mary. Flowers was in some form my wake-up call to my primary passion throughout late high school and onward for the next 15 to 20 years. I had been a bit of a standard idealistic patriotic \u201cAmerica Can Do No Wrong\u201d Irish Catholic schoolkid up until some point in high school when a particular professor began undressing The Emperor and revealing how America historically wasn\u2019t all that much better or worse than most other countries when it came to wars and foreign exploitations and such. I didn\u2019t have a lot of real trust in his analysis, but it had been bugging me, and then one night I saw a video presentation of Flowers with images of war and soldiers going back and forth and dying over the same patch of land, and tearful people and all sorts of other images that somehow, along with the lyrics and the tune reached inside me, latched strongly on my ongoing concerns about nuclear war, and turned me solidly toward being a full blown peacenik who \u201cWanted To Find A Solution\u201d to the problem of war. That led to the creation of the Peace Studies Major, and the graduate work in Peace Research, and the years of nonviolence training with Philadelphia\u2019s Quakers. As those who know me from my Quora writings will know, my focus shifted in the last 30 years over to fighting against what I argue to be the lies of the modern antismoking campaign. This too has its roots in Flowers because I\u2019ve seen the same sort of propaganda and brainwashing tricks that had normally been reserved to whip up popular support for wars put to a new use: social engineering in peacetime! Add in the \u201cback and forth\u201d nature of prohibition campaigns and the divisiveness and suffering they cause, and my path was set. What would my life have been like if I had NOT seen that video at that time after having had a course with that teacher? I don\u2019t know: I might have simply moved in the same direction at a slightly later date. But I also might not have. Thus Where Have All The Flowers Gone? would indeed be appropriate as the soundtrack that at least had the greatest influence on my life, although I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s actually the soundtrack OF my life.  MJM, who eventually learned to play the guitar so I could specifically play this song.",
