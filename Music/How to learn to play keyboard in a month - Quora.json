            "answer_text": "I have given this advice before to students questioning how long will it take for me to learn an instrument? Learning to play the keyboard in just one month depends on several factors. What you consider is \u201cplaying the keyboard\u201d - what do you expect to be playing after a month; \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d or \u201cChopin\u2019s Polonaise-fantaisie, Op. 61\u201d?How talented you are in music - obviously, someone really talented will be able to catch things faster than someone who is not.How much time will you dedicate to learn/practice your keyboard - the more time you spend practicing, the faster you will learn.Which method will you use to learn the instrument - will you be on your own, using a book, or will someone teach you? A teacher can correct your mistakes, guide your practice to where you need it most, etc.I stated this to warn you that, your expectations might be unrealistic based on the above variables and you might end up frustrated to the point where you stop trying to learn the keyboard, and that would be a pity. There should be no rush to learn an instrument, unless you have a terminal disease and have been given 2 months to live. Enjoy the process, enjoy every achievement. Start practicing a riff slowly using a metronome and surprise yourself when you can play the riff at twice the speed. All that said, and considering all of the above, yes you can learn to play a keyboard in 1 month, but not necessarily up to your expectations. ",

            "answer_text": "You can learn to play keyboard in a day, depending on your goals of desired proficiency. Without sitting down to understand any level of musicianship, you can spend a few hours and muscle-memory your way into playing Mary Had A Little Lamb. With a month, and a good intro book like Suzuki vol 1., you could probably get a few one-handed Sonatinas under your belt with diligent practice. Whether you understand why the piece is what it is is another situation. There is much more to playing \u2018keyboard\u2019 than just reciting songs. Basic musicianship includes relaxation and groove, neither of which you will achieve in such a small amount of time. So if you want to regale your company with a light-hearted and groove-free rendition of Twinkle Twinkle, then this is possible. But any serious two-handed interdependence will take quite a bit longer to become comfortable. If I were you, I\u2019d get the aforementioned Suzuki vol 1. and start at page 1, diligently working your way through dedicated practice. I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019ll end up, but at least it will be further then you are now (assuming no prior knowledge). ",
