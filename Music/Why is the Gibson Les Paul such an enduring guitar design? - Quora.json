            "answer_text": "There are a number of reasons: 1. Tonal CharacteristicsThe LP is a set neck with a mahogany body, maple cap, rosewood fretboard and humbucker pickups. The result is a full bodied sound with unique and instantly recognisable characteristics. The humbuckers were a breakthrough at the time, not only for their function of \"bucking the hum\", but for increased output that warms up amps real nice. In it's day it was revolutionary. Not only was it perfect for country/jazz/soul/blues, it was the first ever shred machine with sustain unheard of in any guitar of it's day. 2. PlayabilityShort scale length, fast neck and low action, great balance... in the right hands it runs like a sports car! 3. Roles Royce factorIn an era where the only competition was focused on cheap production line techniques and gimmicky shapes, Gibson spared no expense in creating a top level instrument on par with it's finest arch tops. Everything from it's nick joint to it's machine head screams high-end quality. Priced to match, this was no toy. This is an enduring factor today, with all LPs manufactured in USA to high standards and no brand-eroding Chinese versions under the Gibson name. When the headstock say Gibson Les Paul you know it's gonna be well built. 4. The Icon factorThe LP was Gibsons very first solidbody. As with the telecaster, early adoption saw it immediately in the hands of influential iconic artists of the time (not least Les Paul himself!), securing it a place in the hall of fame and a crucial part of the vintage sounds of a generation. This endorsement factor plays heavily in it's continuing popularity, which is perpetuated with each successive generation of players. 5. The OriginalThere are other guitars these days that can do what a LP does, perhaps even better - but ultimately, since it was the original and first, the rest are copies. People tend towards the genuine article, even if copies are better. That's just human nature. 6. Prestige = credibilityIf you own a Gibson LP, everyone (including many non-musicians) will instantly recognise you have a superb quality, expensive instrument. This give a certain credibility that will help you gain the ear of an audience without negative pre-conceived ideas of your skill level. Let's face it, if you stand up on stage with a cheap looking squire (regardless of quality) people will make assumptions about your playing level that could be hard to get past, however ridiculous that may be. When you stand up with a Gibby, the audience are yours to lose. Cynical, I know - but we all know this to be true in our hearts! 7. LooksLets face it, it's a supermodel! Carved maple top, perfectly proportioned, shining chrome, simple but classy fretboard inlays, fretboard and body binding - stunning! Certainly far beyond any solid body of it's era in sophistication and pure class. If I didn't play, I might just buy one to frame! 8. Emotional connection to the musical linageWhen I pick up my LP standard, even though it's only 5 years old it just resonates heritage and history. I feel like I'm picking up a piece of musical legacy in tangible form. It's hard to beat that! ",

            "answer_text": "It can be simply summed up as due to the feeling of pure nostalgia. Despite of being old its design is iconic, it\u2019s instantly recognisable. Single cut body and moustache like headstock, there\u2019s something gentlemanly about its look which you don\u2019t find on other guitars, other guitars just look too pointy, or too flat (of course I like pointy headstocks).Another reason is the resale value. Buying a Gibson Les Paul is literally like an investment, and if you get your hands on a limited run series then rest be assured you\u2019ll get a hefty return when you sell it. In a way it\u2019s similar to buying an Ibanez LACS Guitar, the only difference being the fact that unlike the Ibanez LACS guitars, you can actually buy Gibson and Gibson Custom Shop guitars from a store.It\u2019s aesthetically pleasing but at the same time it\u2019s not overindulgent in terms of aesthetics (ahem..ahem..PRS).Some people just prefer its short scale.There\u2019s a certain image associated with owning few guitars:Gibson Les Paul: Classy and sophisticatedPRS: Snobby, vain, obsession with looks and aesthetics, nitpicks too much about small thingsFender Telecaster: Good old Country BoyIbanez RG, Jackson Soloist, or similar superstrats: Exhibitionist, Show-offKramer and Charvel: Glam Rocker Fender Stratocaster: HumbleGibson Super 400 or Heritage Super Eagle: Old-school, GrandpaFlying V, Explorer, or any kind of sharp pointy guitars: Aggressive, Hotheaded Fender Mustang, Jag-Stang: Cheerful, Easy-going, and sometimes a bit childishSo many musicians try to portray themselves as classy and sophisticated, and don\u2019t get me wrong swinging a Gibson Les Paul on you neck is an easy way to do so. Of course none of these stereotypes are true but there\u2019re people who harbour such stereotypes.It\u2019s one of the oldest solid-body guitar. That\u2019s why it still enjoys the fruits of its early adoption by various popular musicians. It has established as a premium brand because the general public perceives all Gibson guitars to be of high quality.",
