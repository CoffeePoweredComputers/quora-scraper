            "answer_text": "2pac- Staring Through My Rearview. That song is my favorite hip hop song because of the raw uncut analogy of life and hard times. Take the first line of the chorus for example, \u201c Staring at the world through my rearview go head baby scream to God he can't hear you\". When you're going through rough times in life, that line seems true when your circumstances are changing for the better as quickly as you'd like them to. And then there's my favorite line which appears in the second verse- \u201cheavenly father I'm a soldier I'm getting hotter while the world's getting colder\". In my life, that one line sums up my mindset in regards to the world around me. It's like the more I learn the less I want to deal with this world. Like Pac said, the world is cold and is getting colder and I'm hot and getting hotter. I don't know exactly what 2pac meant when he wrote that line but my interpretation of it is this- When I say I'm getting hotter, I mean I'm becoming more empathetic to the people that the world doesn't care about. Once you've lived in the streets as a homeless man and witnessed the true nature of society, you start to realize what \u201cthe world is getting colder\u201d truly means. Staring Through My Rearview isn't the best all time 2pac song but for me, defines the mentality I had to develop to avoid losing myself when I was in the belly of the beast. ",

            "answer_text": "OK, so, I'm not sure I can pick one song. So what I'll do is split this into a few categories: Oldschool (pre-2000), nostalgic (the songs I heard in the early to mid naughties, I know, I'm young), all-round favourites, and the song I seem to be binging at the moment. Oldschool: 3: Grandmaster Flash - The Message This is about as far back as my hip-hop knowledge goes and it's a truly great song that helped pave the way for hip-hop as it is today. 2: Sugarhill Gang - Rapper's Delight Probably the cheesiest song on this list but it was the first song I learnt to rap in full, so it'll always have a place on this list for me. 1: Tupac - Ghetto Gospel Ok, Tupac is obviously one of the all-time greats, whether this is his best song or not is up for dispute. But the message of the resonated with me on a level that not many songs from that era have done. Nostalgic: 3: Outkast - Hey Ya! Now this may not be the most lyrical song out there, but it never failed to liven up the school disco. It was also the first hip-hop song I ever heard. 2: Eminem ft Dr Dre and Hittman - Forgot About Dre I remember being a kid hearing this and going \u201cDamn\u201d; even now I'm still picking up on new things I hadn't registered before when I listen to it. 1: Eminem - Without Me What can I say? As a kid the music video always had me laughing and the song is full of punchlines. Now we get to the nitty-gritty\u2026 All-time favourites: 3: Eminem - Sing for the Moment Great song with a great message, a true classic. 2: Tech N9ne ft Wreckonize, Twisted Insane and Snow Tha Product - So Dope (They Wanna) Now Tech N9ne can be hit and miss, his flow means some beats really don't work for him. But this one really, really works well for him. Wreckonize follows up with a great verse, Twisted Insane is kinda meh - I genuinely had to look it up to find out what they hell he was saying at parts. But the verse that well and truly kills it is by Snow Tha Product Now, for the top spot I'm going to with a dark horse here: Crooked I ft Tena Jones - Nobody Cares Truth be told, this is here for sentimental reasons; it's a song that, while lyrical, highlights the issues with the world and has helped me through some stuff. My current binges: 3: Chris Webby - Jurassic Park I'm impressed he even made a beat out that, lyrically it's nerdy as hell which I love. 2: Hoodie Allen - No Faith In Brooklyn Just an easy song to listen to, nothing too complex. 1: Crooked I ft Snow Tha Product - Not For The Weakminded This song is lyrical as all hell.
