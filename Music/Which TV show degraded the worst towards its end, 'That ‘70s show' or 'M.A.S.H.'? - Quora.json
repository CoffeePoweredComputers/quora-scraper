Whereas as many have pointed out, That 70\u2019s Show went downhill after Topher Grace left. If MASH had degraded there\u2019s no way it would be able to hold the record for the most watched finale in American TV history. In fact, the finale is the ninth most watched TV broadcast, beaten only by the Super Bowl broadcasts from 2010\u20132017. I just wish today\u2019s TV writers are as good as the ones writing MASH. ",

            "answer_text": "Imho, of course: \u201cThat 70s Show\u201d was underrated throughout its time, but that being said, the seasons after Topher Grace left were a sad echo of his tenure. Eric Forman was the center of the show; almost all scenes were set in his house, and it was his relationships that we mainly followed. M*A*S*H* got stale, to be sure, but the main characters stayed until the bitter(sweet) end. I think you\u2019d find a better comparison to the Eric-less \u201c70s Show\u201d with the Hawkeye and BJ-less \u201cAfterM*A*S*H* instead. ",
