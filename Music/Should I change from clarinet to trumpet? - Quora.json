            "answer_text": "I only play trumpet, but from what my teachers and mentors have told me, brass is more difficult in general at the high school level. (to be fair, they all majored in trumpet performance) Brass players\u2019 embouchure has to be maintained daily. Your lips and tongue are a whole new muscle that you\u2019ve never worked out. (or at least, in the way that brass requires) At your level, you could easily catch up to your peers\u2019 level of playing in months, if you really work at it. And you\u2019ve just said that you find the music at your level easy. If you\u2019re good at clarinet, use that to your advantage. You\u2019re about to get to high school, and harder music. To me it seems like your problem is that you\u2019re not being challenged. I felt the same way. Middle school is a time where the band is only as good as its worst member. High school brings a wider variety of bands and many new opportunities and challenges, as well as new music. As for your comment that there are only two trumpets, I wouldn\u2019t look at that. I\u2019m not sure how it stacks up to clarinets, but trumpet playing is very competitive. Everyone and their dog played trumpet in middle school. But I still wouldn\u2019t factor that into a choice of whether to play any instrument or not. If you have a passion for it, you will want to work harder than the competition. Now, your choice depends on your plans for the future. Do you want to be a musician? Do you plan to continue to the high school level? Do you plan to play in college? My advice to you is not to quit anything. I quit piano as a youngster and regret it. I quit learning bagpipes and regret it. I still play trumpet and love it. Keep working on your clarinet, and challenges will come to you. If you want to try trumpet, go for it. It\u2019s a beautiful instrument, with a wonderful history. ",

            "answer_text": "As a first chair clarinet, you\u2019re doing pretty well for yourself, congrats. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a reason to switch for several reasons. My middle school band had 6th, 7th, and 8th graders in it, which meant that the music we played was pretty watered down so everyone could handle it. That won\u2019t be the case in a year or two when you\u2019re in high school.Concert bands are not the most fun groups to play in. They try to be like an orchestra, but they always seem like a lyrical marching band decided to sit down for awhile. Find a symphony-orchestra to play in, either at your school or in the community. A local community symphony restored my desire to play music. And created an abiding love for Dvorak. You\u2019ll also have a marching band to be in too.If you stay on your instrument, you can get good. Think about all the muscle memory you\u2019ve put into the clarinet fingerings. Now, trumpet isn\u2019t the hardest thing in the world to learn, but you\u2019d still have to start from the beginning. You\u2019ll be better if you don\u2019t switch.And if you must switch, try playing sax in a jazz group. Similar fingering, and the music is tons of fun (another restoration of my faith in performance music was from starting in the jazz band).You mentioned practicing over summer break. Find a community group to play in. I did a couple of performances one year with the Brass Band of Central Illinois over the summer just for kicks. It\u2019s good experience.Now, as a trumpet player, I usually wouldn\u2019t miss the chance to add a convert to our ranks (which are totally awesome, by the way), but I think that if you stick it out with the clarinet a little longer, get plenty of practice, and seek out opportunities to play in the community. Best of luck to you. References: a long time playing trumpet in more groups than I can remember (All State Orchestra, Illinois Symphony Orchestra, my collegiate symphony and concert band, as well as a handful of jazz groups and solo performances) ",
