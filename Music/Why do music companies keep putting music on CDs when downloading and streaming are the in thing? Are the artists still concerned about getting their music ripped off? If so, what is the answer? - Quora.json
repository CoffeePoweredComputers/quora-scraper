            "answer_text": "The reason why companies keep releasing CDs is simple \u2014 people like me buy them. Once we don\u2019t, or not enough of us do, then CDs will go the way of the 8-track. But not until then. CDs are great, the best portable music format in existence. They are high-quality, easy to transport, and damage-resistant. Vinyl is great, but it\u2019s finicky and you can\u2019t play it in your car. Best reserved for the home stereo. Cassettes tend to crimp, break, or melt. 8-Tracks have always sucked. But what about MP3s? Yeah, you can load them up on a player and listen through your ear buds, but what goes into your ears is crap. In order to get as much music onto those devices as can go on them, they have to cut out a good chunk of the music. You won\u2019t notice with the ear buds, but you will if you\u2019re playing through decent speakers. You can use lossless conversion like FLAC, but FLAC players are a bit of a pain in the ass. I know because I have one. Sometimes I\u2019ll load up the FLAC player and take it along in the truck with me, but usually that\u2019s just for road trips. Otherwise, it\u2019s easier for me to pick out some CDs, pop them in my carry case, and listen to them instead. Streaming isn\u2019t always convenient, and again you get into problems with stripped-down files that just don\u2019t sound that good. Also, when I buy a CD, I own it. I\u2019m not leasing it. I can do whatever I want with it, including ripping it to my FLAC player. And the more folks dump their old CDs on the used market, the more opportunity I have to snap it up at a deep discount and add it to my collection for listening directly from the CD or, if I choose, the digital version I\u2019m going to rip as soon as I\u2019ve listened to the disc to make sure there are no errors. Other formats, excepting vinyl and reel-to-reel, aren\u2019t as good as CDs for listening through a good system, and those formats are high-maintenance and non-portable (unless you\u2019re taking some of your LPs over to someone else\u2019s place where there\u2019s a turntable). So it\u2019s CDs for me until they stop making them. ",

            "answer_text": "Think you summed it up with this \u2018in thing\u2019. If you have a CD or vinyl if you look after it, it can last a lifetime and you have a collection that you can be proud of and show people. Digital media has no permanency, who knows if mp3 will still be a thing in 20 years, who knows if Spotify will even be around in 5 years. Songs get removed from these services all the time. If you want a tangible record of your music that you can convert into any format you want and store any way you want. CD is the best thing. Artists and record companies will release Cds as long as their is a market. C'mon even cassettes sales rose last year. People still want them. I use Spotify all the time but I can't tell you easily what albums I downloaded in 2014 but if I look on my shelf i can tell you which ones I bought. If I really like an act or an album I will still buy it, streaming is not a commitment or reward for them. ",
