            "answer_text": "Long ago before the days of the Internet, one would have a lot of trouble finding versions of songs without a certain instrument in the mix. There were actually records specifically sold to play along with for musicians, but never became that popular, so most individuals just dealt with doubling the instrument on the record (or found band mates to jam with). Nowadays, it's a lot easier depending on the instrument you play. Go to YouTube or Google, and look up the name of the song in question, but with \u201c\"without guitar\u201d or \u201c\"no drums\u201d at the end of the title. Chances are some audio junkie out there has refined the original track to exclude said instrument in the mix. If no results show up, you can always look up a cover of the song on piano or guitar and play along with another person covering the song in a more stripped down manner. If all else fails: Please find another musician to work with. Not only will this provide an outlet for you to practice the songs you wish to work on, but you'll be advancing their skill as well. You'll find that jamming with another person will be way more natural and flexible than playing with an audio track. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a pretty hard to do. If you want separate tracks of each instrument of a song, you have to get your hands on the multi-tracks/stems somehow. This definitely not something you can do by just playing around with the mp3 in Audacity or something. Anyways, stems generally aren\u2019t released unless they end up on a rockband/guitar hero game or the artist hosts like a remix contest or something like that. Or they\u2019re just VERY generous to remixers and producers. Either way, it\u2019s always worth a shot to search up \u201c[Artist Name] - [Song Name] Multitracks\u201d and see if there\u2019s any lying around. Like I\u2019ve said, not too many artists put them out, but you can get lucky. If you do find them, you just have to throw them all together in a program like Audacity or a DAW that you use and either mute or simply delete the part that you don\u2019t want. Good luck! ",
