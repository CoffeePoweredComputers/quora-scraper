            "answer_text": "Using someone else\u2019s music in your video as background music without their permission is copyright infringement, even if you change the pitch. If the infringement is detected, your video hosting service may remove your video or mute its audio track. Your service could also suspend your account or monetize your video using advertisements, with the revenues going to to the music\u2019s copyright holder. In extreme cases, the music\u2019s copyright holder might sue you for copyright infringement, which, depending on your country\u2019s copyright laws, might result in severe financial penalties or even imprisonment.

            "answer_text": "Yes. That's copyright infringement, you're only making it harder to be caught. Not complying with the law. Blocked vudeo, DMCA takedown notice, copyright strikes by the service you upload to, or even the possibility of being sued by the musical artist. You run all of these risks. And presumably you want your video viewed by millions. More viewers means more risk. Why not use music that comes with permission to use it? Where can I find royalty-free background music for inclusion in videos and short films? ",
