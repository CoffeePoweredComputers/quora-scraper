            "answer_text": " The Black Sea region is very large and versatile. So you have variations and differences. It's different from place to place. So, there is a very large variety of different clothing and accessories. In fact, you can see special clothes for elderly women, children and widows.  The Black Sea region you mention is the Do\u011fu Karadeniz (Eastern Black Sea, red circle). Even that place has differences from place to place. The main ethnic groups are Turks (mainly Oghuz Cepni), Hemshin people, Laz people, Georgians, etc. Almost all of the people out there including me are collectively called Laz (inspired by Laz people\u2019s name but by the jokes) because the people of the eastern part of the Black Sea are famous for being funny, also very hotblooded and unpredictable like the Black Sea. Where I come from, people are mainly Turks of the Oghuz Cepni clan, not Laz at all but because of the jokes and the region, people assume we talk the Laz language :D. But we speak a very different language than the Laz people, one of the unique languages that are spoken only in our region. It\u2019s called bird language (Turkish language communicated through high-pitch whistles and melodies). I can understand and talk basic language and curse with it :D but my whole village folk talk the same language as those people in Ku\u015fk\u00f6y (bird village). My village is a couple of villages away from Ku\u015fk\u00f6y (bird village) :D.  Originally used by Turkish farmers to communicate over large distances and now down to 10,000 speakers, it is at risk of extinction as mobile phones replace this purpose. The language is associated with Ku\u015fk\u00f6y, a village in Turkey's northern Pontic Mountains that has hosted a Bird Language, Culture and Art Festival annually since 1997. UNESCO included the bird language in its 2017 list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. So where I come from, the Cepni Oghuz people from Giresun to central Trabzon mainly have colorful clothing with floral designs that have been used for centuries. Their life style is mainly based on pastoralism so they spend winters and summers in different locations. This region is also famous for hazelnuts. You may have heard of it: the world\u2019s biggest hazelnut exporter is Turkey\u2019s northern Black Sea region :D.  Girls picking hazelnut. The girl with the yellow dress is wearing a colored kushak (belt), a piece of cloth for easy handling of heavy loads when they have to carry them on their backs. Behind her on the left, the woman in red is wearing kesan (name of textile) which sees a variety of usages from apron to headscarf. On the right, the girl in the pink dress is wearing a maroon-and-white cotton peshtemal mainly for apron and other usages. People wear mainly normal clothes but also traditional clothes as appropriate. So when you are walking in the bazaar in the city, it's normal to see women with traditional clothes but there are special events like festivals where some insist on wearing traditional clothing.  For example, elderly women such as those in this group tend to wear clothing in darker colors than young women\u2019s. But in festivals such as the Sisda\u011f\u0131 (fog mountain) Festival, you see lots of colorful traditional clothing.  Girls of Agasar, Trabzon, my area. Each region has a different peshtemal, ogluk or yoruk, a piece of cloth on the front of their skirts (simply traditional apron which later became an accessory).  Midsummer there is a festival in my village in the highlands of Sisda\u011f\u0131 (fog mountain) 2182 m above sea level and you can see lots of traditional clothes.  Festival - Everybody is dancing to the sound of kemance, a local string instrument.  Even cows are dressed :D for this event called migration from lower to higher pastures.  This clothing can be seen from Giresun to Trabzon.  Pink and purple peshtemal (made from silk) mainly identifying a newlywed woman or bride. Reds, blue and yellow are commonly used colors.  Left: traditional dress for daily usage. Center and right: mainly for festivals. Also, let\u2019s not overlook their shoes. Rubber or plastic is very good for rainy and mountainous places. You won\u2019t slide :).  Funny side info: The northern Black Sea region is famous for guns. In fact, it\u2019s called the Texas of Turkey :D. You see, if someone shoots a couple of rounds to the sky from a nearby village and you hear the gunshot in mine, you have to say, \u201cI heard you with gun\u201d :D (basically shooting at the sky). If the proper response is not given, people will curse you :)))))  This is the Ak\u00e7aabat region. They look strikingly similar but they have different accessories, no peshtemals, and small accessories and small bags on their belts.  Traditional clothes in my village, G\u00f6rele-Agasar.  This is northern Macedonia, a group of yoruk Turks wearing strikingly similar clothes and styles - 600 years apart :). The people in my region are less mixed and have closer family bonds.  Rize region clothes. See headscarf wearing style and different peshtemals. The men don't wear traditional clothing anymore except in folk dances.  Hemshin region. Hemshin ethnic people.  Trabzon-Rize region. Women harvesting tea leaves.  Trabzon. Women wearing kesan textile harvesting tea leaves.  Artvin-\u015eav\u015fat region. So you have a very large collection of clothing and accessories, which is very unique.  Kesan textile may be worn in many different ways. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019m from the Black Sea region and if you\u2019re referring to the type of costume as shown in the image below, then yes it is common to wear such a clothing style in everyday life in the little villages. We just love floral printed patterns. But don\u2019t imagine that everyone follows this village-style fashion, people mainly wear casual outfits.  Regarding the traditional festive costumes of the Black Sea region; the image below is actually a pretty good representative. I would recommend you to watch some of our folk dances, such as horon (which is my ultimate favourite.)
