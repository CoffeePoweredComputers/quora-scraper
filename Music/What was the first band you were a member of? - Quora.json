            "answer_text": "It was called The 005 Band in Action, taken from 007, Bond in Action. We had a lead player, keyboard player, bass player and vocalist. I was fourteen and they were a year or so older. We got a band together after seeing all those girls screaming and going crazy over The Beatles. We wanted girls to be screaming and going crazy over us. We started the band to get girls. It worked. We got girls. Wonderful, beautiful girls. My mother, who was managing my older twin sisters with their modelling careers, also managed us. Our first gig was in a church basement for a dance. We were nervous as hell. This wasn\u2019t practise anymore. This was it. This was for real. We donned our band jackets. We had gone shopping for band clothes, my older sisters helping us. We had black pants, white shirts, teal, collarless jackets and Beatle boots like The Beatles wore. They had elastic sides and Cuban heels. Our very first song we played in public was A Hard Days Night by The Beatles. Our lead player did a passable opening chord to that song with his six string Gibson, even though Harrison used a twelve string Rickenbacker. Once into the song and watching the dance floor fill up, we just looked at each other and smiled. That was the beginning of my forty year career as a professional drummer. We played community clubs and school dances. Mom was a great manager. My band had played a dance at our school shortly after this church gig. To play in my band in front of my school and classmates was one of the highlights of my life. The next year we were chosen to play for my older twin sister\u2019s, Lori and Tracy\u2019s, grad dance. That story coming up. ",

            "answer_text": "The Songbirds I was in 9th grade and living in Germany with my family while my father was assigned there by the US Air Force. We lived at Rhein-Main Air Force Base which shared the runways with Frankfurt Airport. We had moved into a flat inside the secured base by this time after living in a small city on the Main river called Kelsterbach for more than a year where it was more difficult to participate in activities outside of school hours. My school was only about one block from our new flat and right at the bus stop, so I could get to any activities on the base on my own or with friends as a young teen. My parents allowed me to participate in as many activities as I wished provided that my grades didn't drop in school. I had begun to find my confidence as a performer the previous year when I won a leading role in our school's musical, so I decided to try out for a band led by one of our male teachers. It was the teacher singing lead and three female students from the 9th grade each year as backup singers. We were called, \u201cThe Songbirds\" which thinking back on it was weird. Was the teacher the \u201cBig Bird? We only performed Neil Diamond songs, and consistent with it being the late 1970s, our costume ended up being a hideous bright orange polyester bellbottom jumpsuit with cream and black accents. Hello Halloween decor! By the end of that year, I had a lot more experience with performing live and singing close harmonies. Yay! I also had a bubbling hate for all things Neil Diamond and for playing tambourines while singing. Ugh. It was a start, and it was a better experience than many have in their first band because I was brought into an existing group with someone who knew how to bring a group together. With hindsight, I would do it again because it led to other opportunities. The very next year I was requested by a rock band to join them in a recording session because a couple of the guys had heard me singing somewhere with a group from my high school music department, and that afternoon of fun made up quite a bit for the year of acoustic guitar and singing a lot of ooh and ahs. Sweet Caroline, blah, blah, blah... ",
