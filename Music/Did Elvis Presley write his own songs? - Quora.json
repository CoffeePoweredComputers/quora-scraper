            "answer_text": "Writing songs is about the words, not the music. NOBODY has written original music since around the beginning of the 20th century\u2026i.e.1900 or so. Its why songs that have huge success in the US are riddled with lawsuits. Most lawsuits are based on \u201crespect of the songwriter\u201d, even though acts like Michael Jackson have been sued. As far as Elvis, let's take his first hit as a possible example to shine some actual fact on this issue. Elvis was voted the most promising country music act of 1955. Through numerous industry channels, a person who knew a person had contacted one of the songwriters of Heartbreak Hotel. Durden, who knew Axton, then got together to pen the music, which is 8 bar blues. The story was inspired by a newspaper article. These two writers don't even agree on who wrote what when asked later in years. After the song was penned, Axton had gotten backstage at a Presley concert because of her connections and gave Elvis the demo tape which was piano and voice only. She told Elvis that if he recorded it as his first single at RCA he could have 1/3 songwriting \u201croyalties\u201d. She actually offered another person the same deal on royalties if he helped with polishing up the song. That person rejected the offer saying the song seemed to dark or morbid. Elvis actually performed it live early late 55 in concert before taking it into RCA studios and recording it in the first half of Jan.1956. After the record came out Presley had writers credit also, but more importantly, the songwriters did not initially realize that was their song when they had heard it because Presley had reworked aspects of the tempo, melody, etc\u2026. RCA execs didn't even want to release it because of how strange the record was content-wise. Well, we know the history and this set the pace for Elvis\u2019 approach to recording. Now, there are plenty of songs Elvis recorded that were simply him singing it because he liked it. There are Elvis songs that are his own style vocally, which made the song different. Besides scene-specific movie songs Elvis only recorded what he wanted to. But make no mistake, a Presley session was everyone could participate. Elvis was the bass player on \u201cYou're So Square, Baby I don't care\u201d because it was an electric bass and Bill Black could not get the bass part the way Elvis wanted it having always been an upright player. How about another example \u201cIn the Ghetto\u201d. The lyric \u201cAnd his Mama Cried\u201d was written by Elvis. Mac Davis penned the song but like most writers who Elvis recorded would later say that that small lyric made the song so much better than it was\u2026. Larry Gatlin wrote \u201cHelp Me\u201d\u2026.Elvis recorded it with such emotion, having recorded it on his knees as if humbling himself in prayer that Larry would later say Elvis gave him that song. Ever hear \u201cSmokey Mountain Rain\u201d by Ronnie Milsap? Milsap was the piano player on Elvis \u201cKentucky Rain\u201d. During the session for the song, Elvis had told Milsap to \u201cput a little more thunder\u201d i.e. add thunderous sounding chords to the piano part in the song before the master take was recorded. Later on his own record Smokey, Milsap had gotten to the point where he wasn't satisfied with the presentation, he said it lacked something, that he had remembered the thunder that Elvis told him to do that he says, \u201cElvis was right, all Smokey needed was a little more thunder\u201d Elvis was a songsmith. He created a style of rock and roll that nobody had done before. Levon Helm, \u201cElvis stood at the crossroads of white and black music. He erased the lines that separated the two and even threw in a little opera. Elvis came up with his own style of rock an roll\u201d. Charlie Watts, \u201dWe all heard those Elvis records. And of course, Elvis wasn't the blues he was just inspired by them\u201d I could go on but no need to, I'm willing to admit that those people know more about music than I do. So you decide if \u201csongwriting\u201d is the same thing as making music. ",

            "answer_text": "Sadly, not only did EP not write his own songs, but his manager Colonel Tom Parker was made it impossible for the best Tin Pan Alley and Nashville songwriters to pitch new material to the King. The reason was simple. Human greed reigned supreme. Thomas Andrew \"Colonel Tom\" Parker was the Dutch-born American manager of Elvis Presley. He wasn\u2019t a Colonel. He wasn\u2019t even American, for he was born Andreas Cornelis van Cuijk in the Netherlands. And speaking of \u201cgoing Dutch\u201d Parker refused to pay top songwriters the going rate and \u201cpoints\u201d (as in 1% = 1 point) for their compositions. So the scuttlebutt was, \u201cLet Elvis record one (and only one) of your songs, so that you have bragging writes, but don't get ripped off twice.\u201d His manager was also the one behind all of the Elvis movies, and they were pretty bad (although it\u2019s great to have Elvis \u201clive on\u201d on the silver screen). All the songs where written by movie studio writers who where\u2026well, they were strictly B-movies! But EP was an amazing man. Through all of this crap, Elvis believed in \u201cTaking Care of Business\u201d. He was generous to a fault, delivered the goods, was often the first person on the set, and really cared. So even ridiculous songs meant to fill the space between EP saying such gems as, \u201cSay, can\u2019t you see the little lady doesn\u2019t want to dance with you\u201d which of course breaks out into a brawl, were delivered with sincerity and grace.

            "answer_text": "Not only did Elvis not write his own material, but the melody from one of his most famous tunes, \u201cCan\u2019t Help Falling in Love\u201d, credited to Hugo Peretti, Luigi Creatore and George David Weiss, was lifted from a song titled \u201cPlaisir d\u2019amour\u201d, written in 1784 by French composer Jean-Paul-\u00c9gide Martini in 1746. The lyrics of \u201cPlaisir d\u2019amour\u201d were taken from a poem written by Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian. According to Wikipedia, this is the English translation of the lyrics from \"Plaisir d'amour\": \"The pleasure of love lasts only a moment, The grief of love lasts a lifetime. I gave up everything for ungrateful Sylvia, She is leaving me for another lover. The pleasure of love lasts only a moment, The grief of love lasts a lifetime. As long as this water will run gently Towards this brook which borders the meadow, I will love you\", Sylvia told me repeatedly. The water still runs, but she has changed. The pleasure of love lasts only a moment, The grief of love lasts a lifetime.\" Quite a different sentiment from Elvis's version! However, to his publisher\u2019s credit, unlike many famous artists from the \u201860s-\u201970s that essentially stole copyrighted music, songs like \u201cHound Dog\u201d and others, that were covers of American blues hit records, were generally credited to the original writers in the liner notes of Elvis records.

He received songwriting credit on a few songs but they were all tracks that he was given co-writing credit on as part of a deal struck by his manager.  But Elvis wasn't just a mindless puppet in the studio. He put his stamp on every song he recorded to some extent. His early SUN singles for example weren't written by Elvis but they had his hand all over them. The arrangements for Blue Moon of Kentucky and That's All right were created by Elvis and Moore and Black (his band) in the studio. That's All Right isn't a radical departure from the original but Blue Moon of Kentucky is turned into a rock and roll number by Presley who changed the tempo and altered the arrangement entirely. ",

Elvis was, as stated by other commenters, responsible for the arrangements of many of his songs; the first four that come to mind are \"That's All Right,\" \"Hound Dog,\" \"Don't Be Cruel,\" and \"Little Sister.\" Priscilla said that she didn't like the two songs that Elvis co-wrote and he never wrote again because he was devastated.

Of course that meant some songwriters stopped writing for him. I don't know if that means Elvis was automatically credited for the songs or if they just made the songwriters pay each time. He may be credited for a few. Bottom line: I don't think Elvis did much in songwriting. He was a performer. ADDED: And an arranger, as David Stewart points out in his reply. And by the way, there is nothing wrong with \"just\" being the singer or the arranger rather than a songwriter. ",

Elvis, who certainly has his faults, simply doesn't seem like that kind of person. Besides, for the most part, Elvis was generally satisfied with his career. (except in his later years) I also sincerely doubt EP even *cared* about that part of the business: if he did, he would have fired Ol Fatso Parker when it was revealed to him a few years after the fact.

He\u2019s credited with co-writing a small number of his songs, most notably \u201cAll Shook Up\u201d and \u201cLove Me Tender\u201d. These were collaborative efforts to say the least. So to answer your question, not so much. ",
