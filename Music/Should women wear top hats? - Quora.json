            "answer_text": "The hat in the image is not a top hat. It looks like more of a fedora. All hats are not the same. A fedora is a snappy kind of hat that looks good on almost everyone. This is a top hat:  Top hats are very formal and are meant to be worn with white tie and tails, generally by men. But they don\u2019t really flatter anyone. ",

            "answer_text": "They're okay for women who're entertainers. I can recall seeing pictures of Eleanor Powell, Marlene Dietrich, Renate M\u00fcller (1933 film, \"Victor Victoria\"), and Josephine Baker in top hats, white tie, and tails, and one gets the idea that they are immortal when looking at those photos/films. It might have something to do with the gulf of time which separates them from us. Everyone isn't flattered by this edgy (on women) look, but it's somewhat of an improvement over the junk a lot of celebs and others wear today. Those women who wear this look need a certain bravura, confidence, and attitude to carry it off the same way a woman needs a certain attitude, persona, and carriage to successfully pull off wearing a fur coat. A \"shrinking violet\" or someone who's very self-conscious and given to worry concerning other people's perceptions couldn't pull it off successfully. ",
