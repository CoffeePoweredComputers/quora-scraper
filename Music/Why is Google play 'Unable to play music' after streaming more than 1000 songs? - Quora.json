            "answer_text": "There are 3 possible problems that lead to the system telling you this Packet overflowThis is caused when a piece of data over a network gets overlapped with another one, this will make a server believe that there were multiple devices trying to communicate to the same server. This would explain why it would be telling you to use one device at a time.SOLUTION: Close your browser and phone for at least 2\u20133 hours, this is so the server will check for device calls (and since none will exist) it should refresh and allow you to play music again.Limit ReachedIt is completely possible that you have reached some sort of limit, now I have never seen any limit on Google Play Music related to overall usage. But it could be the case that you have listened for so long that the system simply locked upSOLUTION: Stop using that account for a while, switch to another account for a couple of days then log back in. If that does not work, then send in a Support Ticket to Google PlayYou are being hackedThis is the best explanation for why it is telling you why to only log into one device at a time. Someone has gotten into your account and (interestingly) is messing your Music selections. (Kinda cruel, but that is not the worst I have seen, it is still pretty nice if you think about it).SOLUTION: Change your password, update your security questions, and add Two-Step Verification, it could be that someone is out to get you.",
