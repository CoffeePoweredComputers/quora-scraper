            "answer_text": "Old school - Turn on your radio to whatever station plays the style of music you enjoy the best. You will be subjected to occasional commercials, but that\u2019s the usual price of getting something for free. College stations and certain nonprofit (mostly classical and jazz) stations may have no commercials and only mention sponsors in passing or at the beginning and end of each program segment. New old school - Find your favorite radio station on the web. Some stations have their own apps you can download to your phone or tablet. New school - Sign up as an advertising-inclusive free subscriber with one of the streaming services like Pandora or Spotify. Google offers a few free streaming options, from Google Play to YouTube Music to Youtube videos of almost any song you can think of. Other free streaming service options include Last.fm, Slacker Radio, iHeartRadio, or Xbox Music. If you are already an Amazon Prime customer, then Amazon has a free tier music stream service as well as a more extensive library for customers willing to pay an extra $10/month. You can often listen to indie artists\u2019 songs for free on their websites. Sometimes you can access their entire catalog; other artists might offer one of their older CDs or a few recent cuts or videos to give you an idea about their music style. See Comparison of on-demand music streaming services - Wikipedia which has a nice color-coded depiction of 30 free, free trial, and subscription-based streaming music services. Streaming services are incredibly cheap ways of enjoying music, often just $5\u201310 per month. If you want to avoid commercials and/or pick the specific songs you want to hear, why don\u2019t you take advantage of the free 1 week trial of a few and decide which one works best with the music you prefer? Think about this as buying your favorite artist one latte per month to keep them producing in the business of writing and performing songs just for you. Or you can buy a harmonica for about $25 and teach yourself to play. Then you\u2019ll have music every time you get inspired. ",
