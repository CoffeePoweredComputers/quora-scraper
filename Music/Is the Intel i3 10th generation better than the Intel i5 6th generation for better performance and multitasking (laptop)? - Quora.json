            "answer_text": "Depends what models you\u2019re referring to. There are numerous i3-10th gen stuff for laptops. There\u2019s also numerous i5-6th gen as well. These tend to vary even more between those models. As sample, 3 of the \u201c10th\u201d gen i3\u2019s compared to one of the \u201c6th\u201d gen i5s: Intel Core i3-10100T @ 3.00GHz vs Intel Core i5-6440HQ @ 2.60GHz vs Intel Core i3-1005G1 @ 1.20GHz vs Intel Core i3-10110U @ 2.10GHz One of them is in fact faster, both single and multi thread. While the other two are a bit below the multi thread and slightly higher on single thread. Not enormously, but still. E.g. for single thread between the i5\u20136440HQ and the i3\u201310110U there\u2019s a 14% improvement. But then that i3 is only 78% as fast as the i5 on multi threads, a drop of 22%. Then again, the newest i3\u201310100T beats that i5 in multi threads by a whopping 43%. Probably due in part to it now having 4 cores hyper threaded to try and compete with the AMD Ryzens. Previously the i5 only had 4 cores and no hyperthreading. But then its single thread performance isn\u2019t a hugely faster thing, in fact it\u2019s ever so slightly slower than the i3\u201310110U\u2019s single threads by fractions of a %. ",

            "answer_text": "In gaming performance, not all i3 is better than i5 processor of two different gen. That means i5 of 6th gen with H - series processor outperforms the i3 of 10th gen u series processor actually. And for the multi-tasking aspect then i5 processor will clearly win the aspect at no time. As i5 has more cores\u2019 and threads\u2019 than the i3 10th processor or any new-gen has yet in it. So, you can stream by using the i5 processor. In the end, not in all ASPECT DO AN I3 PROCESSOR WILL WIN OVER THE I5 PROCESSOR EVEN IF THE TWO PROCESSOR ARE OF DIFFERENT GEN OF INTEL COMPANY. Have a nice day. ",
