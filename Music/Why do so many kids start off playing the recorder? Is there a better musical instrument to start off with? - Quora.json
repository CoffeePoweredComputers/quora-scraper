            "answer_text": "Plastic flutophones cost $2.99. They can manage one octave, plus Bb, C#, and F#. Yet, learning to play one, and learning to read music at the same time, involves practice, as much as fifteen minutes a day. If a kid is willing to put out that much time and effort, then the parents may consider renting, or even buying, a real instrument. Just a couple of days ago, I had a reason to dust off my recorder, which I hadn't touched in a half century. It's made of wood, and it can handle two and a half octaves of chromatic scale. Its box is still marked with the price, $5.95. I bought it in, roughly, 1958, so its price today would be around $25 or $30. That's still a high price to pay to test a child's willingness to practice. What other instrument to start off with\u2026? Percussion traps don't require breath control. Possibly a bugle, though even the ones that come from India are in the twenty dollar range. U.S. regulation military bugles cost more than wooden recorders. I can't think of any reed or string instruments that cost $2.99. Old pianos are often free to a good home, so that might work, if there is space for one. But, if the child ignores the piano, the parents are stuck with it. A plastic recorder can be relegated to the toy box without a second thought. ",

            "answer_text": "I hear you. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the best instrument to start out with but I think I know why it\u2019s a popular first instrument. It\u2019s super cheap. A soprano recorder is like $3. Not many instruments can match that price point.It\u2019s totally portable.It\u2019s pretty easy to produce a decent sound. I know young aspiring recordists sound pretty awful. But compare them to young violinists.You don\u2019t have to worry about intonation. Just cover the holes completely and that\u2019s good enough for a child.I really think a piano or keyboard would be better but the cost would be prohibitive. And kids couldn\u2019t lug it around every day. They\u2019d have to have something at home. ",
