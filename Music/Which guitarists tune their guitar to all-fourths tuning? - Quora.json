            "answer_text": "A fun question. I don't know of too many. The fourths tuning has a certain nice logic to it, although the main complaint is that convenient chord voicings are lost. That goes with what Joachim said - bass players, though they may play chords, probably wouldn't worry as much about chord voicings, so they normally will use fourths all the way across even with many strings.  Allan Holdsworth talked about experimenting with all-fourths and all-fifths tuning (chords gotta be pretty crazy with that!), but I don't think he stuck with them.  Here's my favorite guy playing with all-fourths, Tom Quayle from England, although you may already know of him from YouTube. He's very, very good. He does a lot of lessons on there, and will point out when his fingerings differ from regular tuning.    ",
