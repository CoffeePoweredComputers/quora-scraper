            "answer_text": "What genre are you in? If classical, the great soloists have agents who manage their careers, and so you could arrange to audition for an agent when youo complete your formal studies. Most, however, join the musician\u2019s union and audition for seats in a professional symphony, where they\u2019ll be covered by a collective bargaining agreement\u2014with opportunities to supplement income by teaching or taking side gigs. If jazz, rock, country, hip hop, etc.\u2014well, there\u2019s more than one way. Some few acts are able to get an enormous fan base on their own, like Dave Matthews or Pearl Jam did through dint of hard work and lots of dues-paying, and in their cases the big record labels came asking them to sign on. In the case of Ani diFranco, the big companies recruited her but she refused and instead kept self-profucing. In other cases you might catch the ear of a promoter or industry rep who will shepherd your career\u2014watch the movie \u201cThat Thing You Do\u201d and you\u2019ll see how that part of the business works, and also note that the record company cared little for the musicians and in the end, their months of touring and one big hit single left the band members with no money\u2014that\u2019s true to life, the record company will use accounting tricks to keep all the money for themselves unless (a) you become a superstar and/or (b) you have a good lawyer to negotiate contracts and to order audits. There are also some musicians who manage to make a living in non-union areas by finding good-paying gigs on their own, but that\u2019s a low-security existence. ",

            "answer_text": "Same way you get signed to a pro football team. Be greatGet a lot of experience. Persist through setbacks.Demonstrate your value to the people in charge, and your money-earning potential. Be competitive.Chances are exceedingly slim. And no one will sign you because you seem to have potential. You have to exhibit your greatness and come with a fan base you have grown already. This is the pop music route. Other styles are equally challenging but have somewhat differing steps. \u201cBe great\u201c is common to all styles, though. ",
