            "answer_text": "I suspect you do not know what that term means. \u201cRoyalty-free\u201d means that the content is offered with a use license that does not require any ongoing royalties per-use. It usually has an upfront fee, a one-time payment. But might possibly be entirely free. You can\u2019t tell from the term \u201croyalty-free\u201d. But it definitely does not automatically mean \u201cfree\u201d. But no, SoundCloud songs are not licensed to listeners for any use at all. They are under copyright protection and they cannot be copied, redistributed, or used in a new derivative work. Clearly you are confusing \u201cpublished\u201d where people have access to enjoying that content, with some sort of status in which copyright does not apply. No, that\u2019s not a thing. ",
