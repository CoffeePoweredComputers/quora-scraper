            "answer_text": "When you are creating your videos and you want to use copyrighted music, you write a letter to the publisher and get permission to use it. Do you view credits in movies? Most to not. All music used in a movie is listed and not just to inform the movie viewer. Music often appears in movies. Music is a key part of movies like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d and enhances the film. All of the songs used in the movie are listed in the credits. Parody songwriters like Wierd Al Yankovic contact the original artist to ask permission to use their songs even though a parody may not require it. It is a courtesy and can add value to the parody version of the song. (Sometimes the artist may appear in the music video as Greg Kihn did in \u201cI Lost on Jeopardy\u201d.) You are making an error in thinking that the writer of the song you want to use will say no or that it might be a complicated process. If you can write a simple and polite business letter, you can get it done in just a few days. Don\u2019t let a simple technicality stop you in your video productions. If a piece a music will help your video, go through the steps so that you can include it just like the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d movie makers did. ",

            "answer_text": "Ignore the myths that an amount under a certain length can be used, you CAN NOT use even two seconds of copyrighted music - without permission from the copyright holder. The only exceptions are under \u201cfair use\u201d (or fair dealing in the UK). Fair use is NOT a permission to use, it is a \u201cpossible defence\u201d in law if the copyright holder sues you. This might help: Can I use a few seconds of copyrighted music in my production without having to pay royalties? Added by edit:- As you mention monetising that would almost definitely (not absolutely) rule out any chance of your use of the music being ruled as \u201cfair use\u201d. ",
