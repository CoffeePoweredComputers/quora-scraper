            "answer_text": "A good point has been made in the answers below. DAWs aren't necessarily 'better' than one another. I would recommend a DAW that allows you to learn the core parameters of mixing and midi composing so when you upgrade, you already know what your basic set up is and how it works, without being bogged down with the extra features that bigger DAWs offer. There will be plenty of time to learn those once you have the basics mastered. My suggestion is a little off the beaten track. Mixcraft 6 (or 7) has been my main DAW for 3 years at least. It is incredibly intuitive and the forums are quite good for answers as the developers themselves (as far as I'm aware) can give answers to your questions. It contains all the main components and plugins you'd need to get started which have been developed by a variety of 3rd party developers and Mixcraft themselves. I am looking to upgrade to Cubase for bigger film scores as I think there is a track limit for me on Mixcraft 6. However it has no problems loading up high quality sample libraries and handling live recordings although I can see why for live audio other DAWs take primacy. This aside it will still handle your tracks just fine in my opinion and gives a good introduction to the fundamentals of music production which can then be developed in greater detail in a more complex DAW later down the line. I should also add it is not an industry standard format (.mx6) so you will have to export midi and audio independent to work between different parts of your team or if you would like someone else to mix a track if you have too much work coming in. At the end of the day, there is no substitute for a good musician at the core, no matter how shiny the samples or DAWs are or how slick the live audio comes out! ",

            "answer_text": "Do you want the truth? The truth is that learning audio production is more about learning a solid process, understanding how to capture sounds, learning about microphones and their best use, learning to work with musicians to evoke their best performances. So do anything you can to start working with musicians recording their music with anything you can get your hands on and that will be time well spent. Do you want the reality? The best DAW for a beginner is the one that fits your budget! There are a lot of choices. If you know you are serious about a long term commitment to producing music, you can jump right in and easily spend several hundred dollars, but if you want to start small, you can do that too. The industry-standard professional choices include Avid ProTools, Apple\u2019s Logic, Abelton, Reason, Sonar (now discontinued), CuBase and a few others. If you want to test the waters for less money, you can learn a lot about the process by using an entry level tool as simple as GarageBand. Other really inexpensive choices are Audacity and Reaper and those two are more in line with the pricier options above. But the bottom line is that the fundamentals of a decent recording apply regardless of the tool. Soundwaves are soundwaves, noisy tracks sound bad, too much reverb makes for a mess, etc. You should also consider if you are leaning toward making beats or electronic music with samples, or if you are more interested in capturing the performance of real musicians playing instruments and mixing that into a song. The first choice might point towards using Logic or Abelton. The later suggests ProTools, Cubase, Reason or Reaper as they focus more on recording and mixing multiple .wav files (as each track) rather than samples that you place on a timeline and manipulate.
