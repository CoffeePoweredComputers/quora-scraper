            "answer_text": "FLAC is a lossless compression format for PCM audio. Unlike mp3 which is a lossy audio format designed originally for CD audio with a fixed resolution of 44.1Khz at 16 bit depth, the maximum bit rate of mp3 encoding had been limited/standardised to 320 Kbps. Since FLAC is a lossless format it has no such standardised resolution limit. Bit rate of a stereo CD audio (at 44.1Khz/16bit) as a FLAC encoded file is 1411kbps. Higher resolution PCM audio (often called HD audio) can have a bit depth of 24 or 32 bits and a sample rate of anywhere up to 192Khz. This level of resolution was found on now defunct DVD-A discs which were a HD audio consumer format. Such HD audio tracks can still be purchased online from a few resources. Higher resolution PCM audio formats are mostly used in audio production by audio mixing and mastering engineers. The bit depths for them can go up to 32bits. Such files can be compressed using FLAC format for playback. For example a 192Khz/24 bit stereo PCM audio FLAC encoded file will have a bit rate of 9216kbps. ",
