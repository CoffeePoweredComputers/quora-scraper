            "answer_text": "Well, they seem really nice and are respectful of idols. They give them alot of freedom and don't overwork them. The CEO is also close to all groups. However, besides Mamamoo, other groups from there I've never heard of them. I'd say if you're a girl, people would be more inclined to check you out. Also, they have high standards for vocalists especially, so you would want to train for a long time. If you're a boy, I don't think I would. I would go to SM, Starship or Pledis for boy groups because they're known for it. SM you'd probably be put into NCT, but you would want to speak a separate language. The new CEO talked about NCT Europe and NCT Hollywood so I suggest knowing one of their languages. Starship are known mostly for Monsta X. Again, they have alot of freedom for artists, but visuals are very important and the diets are very extreme Pledis is famous for Seventeen and Nu'est, both very successful groups. They are known for mistreatment for groups like Pristin and Nu'est unless you self produce. They prioritise boy groups though. Again, visuals are important. For a girl, JYP or SM. However, JYP just released Itzy so they will probably wait a while before they debit another girl group. They also have that knew Japanese group. SM has plans for a new girl group and they debuted Red Velvet 5 years ago, so you would have to wait a while. Hope that helped :) ~Levy~ ",

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s positive for you,but there stylists are soooo good 99% of the time Negative: Can you say 5 artist from them? probably not,they are really bad at promotion. I think they aren\u2019t that good with choosing activities for there idols. Like there artists rarely attend to any show on TV. How they treat scandals:Bad,but not that bad.They just make you apologize.If you do anything that provoked others. So over all,they aren\u2019t a bad company,just a company with a shitty management,plus they should learn how to treat scandals. ",
