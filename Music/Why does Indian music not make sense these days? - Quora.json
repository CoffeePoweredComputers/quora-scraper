            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Darshit Parikh I am not sure I understand the question. But let me make some assumptions. By Indian music you probably mean film music. And by making sense, you are probably referring to the lyrics. Actually, the lyrics do make sense. In a manner of speaking. There is a greater tendency to mix in strange sounds, different languages, and cutesy constructions driven by modern social trends. If you see the words in isolation, they are likely to be grammatically correct (whatever). However, don\u2019t expect fine poetry except for the very rare cases. This is simply market demand - and whatever sells\u2026 Second, in the context of the tune and the music itself, words make a little less sense. This is because tunes are not made to suit the words, but just to be catchy dance-y airs for the most part. So words are broken in odd places and seem to be nonsensical. Finally, compared to the golden era of Indian film music, the voice has taken a relatively secondary position and tends to get overwhelmed by the music. You can scarcely hear the words any more! ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the tunes being created these days are very much \u201cInspired\u201d and lacking shades and hues of Indian classical music. To make the scenario worse our lyricist are doing the same i.e. taking too much \u201cinspiration\u201d. Only one example will make it clear. You must have noticed that a song makes it a hit using main theme 'Naina'. And lo there is a flood of songs using 'Naina'. This collective mental bankruptcy of producers, lyricists and music directors is taking the Indian film music to a deep hole. Very rarely we happen to listen to a song which shows depths of lyrics writing and classicism of tune. ",
