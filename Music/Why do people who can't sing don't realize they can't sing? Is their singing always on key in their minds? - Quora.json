            "answer_text": "\u201cOn key\u201d isn\u2019t the most apt phrase. That\u2019s a fun thing I\u2019ve learned at music school. At least, fun fact for me, pedantic correction for you. A better phrase would be \u201cin tune.\u201d Singing \u201coff key\u201d means singing Bbs instead of Bs, or singing Gs instead of F#s. Most people who are \u201cbad\u201d at singing aren\u2019t that far off. A lot of the time, they\u2019re singing a G, not an F#, it\u2019s just a bit flat. Not flat enough to be an F#, but enough that it sounds really, really, wrong. But a lot of the time, it\u2019s not even the intonation! No, you could sing with great intonation, and still really, really suck. Myself, for instance. I took four years of sight-singing classes, and I can say, fairly accurately, that I can, with practice, sing all the right notes to a song, with pretty solid intonation. Not perfect, but not bad. However, my tone isn\u2019t especially good. And a lot of the time, if I\u2019m just singing for fun and happen to record it, I notice that my diction isn\u2019t always clear or consistent. Those are the biggest issues. It\u2019s not the intonation, and rarely the intervals, unless they\u2019re especially hard to sing- it\u2019s tone and diction. Those both take a lot of practice, preferably with a skilled teacher. My sight-screeching professor was a horn player, not a singer- he had a damn good ear for pitch, but tone and diction weren\u2019t his specialties. (Neither was \u201cunderstanding human voice types.\u201d I swear that man thought there were just two- you were either a Man Singer, or a Lady Singer, tenor and soprano, respectively. Basses and altos had no room in his class, no sirree. We suffered together in silence and sang everything down an octave really quietly so he wouldn\u2019t notice and ask us to \u201csing in the right octave.\u201d) I\u2019ve considered taking voice lessons, though, for a semester. I do enjoy singing, and I think it\u2019d be worth it to work on my tone and diction. Being good at those two things is the difference between an \u201cokay\u201d singer and a really good one, and singing with good tone will also help keep your voice healthy and strong- bad tone stems largely from bad singing habits that can damage your voice in the long run. I\u2019m sure an actual singer could provide more and better advice than I can, but I\u2019d definitely say that singing \u201coff key\u201d isn\u2019t the problem, 90% of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot sing alone, and I\u2019m not much better in a crowd. I\u2019m going to guess that most people who can\u2019t sing know that they could never be a soloist, even at a family gathering. And there are also people that are tone deaf when it comes to their singing and really have no idea that they\u2019re missing the note. (I\u2019m tone deaf when it comes to my singing, I truly don\u2019t know that I\u2019m not hitting the note). However, I\u2019ve been told, and accepted that I\u2019m not a singer. But I will sing on occasion, hardly ever in public, and I do so because I enjoy it. Also, if you happen to hear me and dislike it, I\u2019m not going to care. Not every one has the self-confidence to not care that someone doesn\u2019t like their singing. So, please be nice and not complain, they most likely know they\u2019re bad, but they\u2019re having fun. Let them have fun. ",
