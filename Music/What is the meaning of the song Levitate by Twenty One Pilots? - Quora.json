            "answer_text": "(from a website named justrandomthings. com) The general tone of \u201cLevitate\u201d seems to be elaborating the freedom of fighting and winning over depression. Use of eagles flying and phrases such as \u2018levitating\u2019 signify freedom. Chorus The song starts off with Tyler Joseph elaborating on his ability to levitate. This is metaphorical for the ability to detach oneself from negativity. In \u201cNico and The Niners,\u201d Clancy says the only way out of Dema is \u2018up,\u2019 which would be synonymous for flying. \u2018Fire-breathing\u2019 could be a reference to his singing or rapping skills, which he demonstrates in this song. \u2018The things that fell\u2019 lyric from the song is an impressive phrasing of words to fit the contents. Twenty One Pilot is talking about depression, which feeds or fuels on putting yourself down. Hence, the resolution of fighting your inner demons to get out of depression. On the other hand, this lyric draws a reference to the vultures flying around, who feed on dead animals-things that have already fallen. Tyler Joseph also references to getting help to combat depression. \u2018Up\u2019 could be a reference to a higher power or a religion. Or it could be through discovering yourself (a tunnel). Either way, depression is something that could be defeated. You don\u2019t have to live in fear. The banditos are here to help you. Bridge \u2018Come down\u2019 seems to be an invitation for others to help the ones like Clancy. Also, if the help is \u2018up\u2019 and a higher power, this is an invitation for them to help the ones in need. Tyler Joseph talks about \u2018cowards\u2019 which could be a reference to the \u2018things that fell\u2019 lyric from before. The cowardly thoughts that put you down usually hit you the hardest when it\u2019s late into the night and when there is nobody around you. These thoughts and feelings have more control over you when you are alone. So this is when the others have to come down to their aid. Tyler Joseph is begging for a \u2018curse\u2019 in \u201cLevitate.\u201d This could mean that he finds a curse from above is easier to deal with than the depression. Verse Tyler tunes in to the only verse in \u201cLevitate.\u201d Often depression is occurred within ourselves, unable to cope up with the reality of things. It originates from the fabric of our thoughts. Tyler thinks he should probably not share these thoughts, but the song is already rolling\u2026 He says he is close to God in his heart, but in his mind, he has his doubts. Others are getting a whiff of this, and they are circling around him like vultures. Twenty One Pilots shout out to their breakout hit \u201cStressed Out\u201d which showed graffiti on a train. The band is attempting to say that their music is evolving and this phase seems to be a little more serious. Tyler compares the modern culture to a \u2018poacher\u2019 who is always up for the next kill or hunt. Everything is overexposed, and he begs not to be exposed for something-maybe his questions on the higher power. Somebody suffering from depression or sleep paralysis can be very reluctant to sleep in the dark. Dark gives rise to bizarre hallucinations protruded by the mind. Tyler advises them to sleep in well-lit rooms, but not letting the darkness or thoughts causing depression sneak through. Or \u2018light\u2019 could be a reference to the higher power, whereas \u2018shadows\u2019 reference to misbeliefs. \u2018The eight\u2019 could be a reference to 8 of the nine bishops mentioned in \u201cNico and The Niners\u201d who govern the city of Dema. These eight are to be understood as eight things Tyler is insecure about, that could potentially cause depression. Then he adds \u2018habits\u2019 to the eight and the 9 bishops are complete. The singer calls \u2018habits\u2019 the worst out of the nine. Because a habit of putting yourself down could be worse than the actual reason why you are putting yourself down. When it becomes a habit, even the positives may look like negatives. We have decoded \u201cLevitate\u201d to the best of our abilities and knowledge. However, it feels as if there is much to learn about the new album and the message the band is trying to get out. We will hear them and decode them in near future. Until such time, Welcome to the Trench. ",
