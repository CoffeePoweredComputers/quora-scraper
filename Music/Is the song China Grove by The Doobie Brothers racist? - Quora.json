            "answer_text": "\u201cChina Grove\u201d is about a fictionalized version of the town of the same name in Texas, so named because it was once home to a grove of chinaberry trees. The song has literally nothing to do with China or Chinese people, or Asian people in general, and less than 1% of the population of China Grove, Texas, is Asian. Not everything is racist, dude, and that includes \u201cChina Grove\u201d. Chill. ",

Listen to the song, it is an infectious fun beautiful song that makes people feel good and want to dance. The guitar riff is classic rock. There is nothing hateful about it. The song denigrates or attacks no one. The song is fun   ",
