            "answer_text": "It probably depends on the teacher. When I was in elementary school in the US, I joined the school orchestra quite early because I had already been studying the violin quite seriously. Then in 5th grade or so, I was given the option of joining the school band as well. I picked the flute because I had always wanted to play it, and I remember it being more or less on a first-come, first-served basis, although we did have all the instruments laid out in a row so that we could try them out before making our choices and see whether we could actually produce decent sounds. I\u2019ve heard of many professional musicians (mostly wind instruments) in Japan who got their start because they initially wanted to play instrument X, but were persuaded by their teachers to try instrument Y because the X section was already too full. This seems to happen at schools with a really competitive school band. Then again, there are cases where completely different factors come into play. I recently learned that my husband played the euphonium for two years in elementary school, because his music teacher recruited him (against his will) purely for his size. Apparently he was the biggest in his year, and they needed someone big to play the biggest, heaviest instrument. I\u2019m not sure if that was the only factor though, since he does have a pretty decent ear for a non-musician\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "My school starts kids on instruments in sixth grade (if they choose to take music as an elective). I first joined (strings only) orchestra. We were given a lesson on the differences between a violin, viola, cello, and double bass. Then, a clip board was passed around where we wrote our names followed by what instrument we wanted to play. When it got to me, I looked at the list, and saw the dozens of answers for \u201cviolin\u201d. Being the edgy sixth grader that I was, I chose viola. Five years later, I\u2019m still playing and loving the deeper sound. Band was a different story. We also started with a lesson on the differences between woodwinds, brass, and percussion. The kids who could play piano were given the choice of percussion because they could already read bass and treble clef. The rest of us were put in a line, and were tested on how well we could produce a sound on different mouthpieces (brass) or reeds (woodwinds). To play a brass instrument, you need to develop a certain embouchure and be able to buzz. (I\u2019ve also heard it makes you a better kisser) For the life of me I couldn\u2019t buzz, so that left the reeds. I ended up playing the oboe, which sounds like a dying duck when you first start. Probably why I quit after a year. ",
