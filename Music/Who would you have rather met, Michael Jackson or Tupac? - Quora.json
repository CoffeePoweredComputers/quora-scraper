            "answer_text": "2pac is my favorite celebrity and I had the chance to meet his mother at a book signing in Santa Monica, CA several years ago. She was a powerful woman without being loud or aggressive and she commanded an audience. She had a crazy life and her son was raised in chaos but with hope. I never met him but would have loved to. He was some kind fo civil rights symbol in our times and did things with his rap career no one else would able to achieve. I am not a fan of pop music and MJ was king of pop. I have never been a fan of his simply because I dislike pop music. Also, I can never get over knowing he was a pedophile who harmed children. I can sense the pedophilia in his songs like \u201cThriller\u201d where he is a deluded man who lives in his own imaginarium and is pshyscotic and not in reality. People still do not understand psychosis or pedopholia but I can see the fantasy land he created for himself that sheltered him from reality. I also have a theory him being that rich as an adult and that pampered as a child (he WAS an A-list child star despite reports of paternal abuse) may have contributed to him being a deluded predator. Also, his life was like the Truman Show; his entire life since birth to death was televised in some bizarre human experiment and I strongly believe only a black person would be objectified in that way and no one would ever do that to a white male. In conclusion, 2pac is a civl rights hero to me and MJ is some whacked out spoiled pedo to me, so your answer on whom I want to meet should be obvious. ",

NOW. I don\u2019t care what your personal opinion is about Micheal Jackson. I personally think that he was a great person who just got caught up in bad things. He had faults but nobody is perfect. Micheal Jackson was a person who saw the world in a different, kinda childish way. I mean he lived in a amusement park pretty much. I\u2019ve heard multiple people say things like: \u201c He used his house to lure children\u201d But you know someone else who has in an amusement park? Travis Scott. He built over the old, demolished, theme park, and built the new Travis a pedo. Stormi has her little kid friends come over for sleepovers and play dates all the time and nobody thinks anything weird is going on. Micheal Jackson didn't want to be white either. He identified as a black male for his whole life. He told Oprah that when he was casting for his \u201cPepsi generation\u201d commercial that the producers wanted to cast a white boy but MJ said he would be \u201c horrified\u201d if that happened because no matter what he did to his skin he was born black. But above all, Micheal Jackson is the king of pop and he is a legend and i\u2019m trying to learn how to moonwalk. I bought his autobiography, moon walker and have this is it 10th anniversary.  (bossome squad will remember this\u2026\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99-mandi) ",
