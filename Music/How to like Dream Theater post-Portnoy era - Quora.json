            "answer_text": "**Please note that I write this as a fan, from a fan perspective, and I don't feel entitled to tell them what to do, nor is this an angry rant. It's just my opinion** I like some things, and I definitely don't like some other things. In the drumming department, Portnoy vs Mangini, I definitely don't like the new Dream Theater as much as I liked the Portnoy era. Yes, Mangini can play way faster, and he has some serious chops, more technique, and can play very difficult stuff. However, what I liked about Portnoy was his power and his creativity, not only as a drummer, but as a musician and member of Dream Theater.  If you hear different DT albums and also see them live, you'll notice that Mangini can play insanely fast and complex stuff, but Portnoy sounds louder, more powerful, more energic, more engaged. Check out different performances of the same songs (\"These Walls\", \"Trial of Tears\", \"As I Am\") and you'll see that Mike Portnoy is always happy, is always thinking what to do next, jumping, throwing sticks, and having fun, while Mangini plays like it's his job. It is a personality thing, but it's also because Portnoy LOVED his band and his songs and his audience, and that is reflected when he's playing. For Dream Theater, I prefer the artistic, creative, and hard rock/metal approach that Portnoy has, over the fast, technical, robotic style of Mangini (not that there's something wrong with it, I just don't like it for DT). Mangini doesn't take anything from Dream Theater's music, he just doesn't add like Portnoy did. He sounds like a virtuoso, of course, and I could only Dream (!) of becoming as good a musician as him. In the album department, I haven't been blown away by any of the 3 post-Portnoy albums as a whole, like I was (and still am) with \"Images and Words\", \"Scenes from a Memory\", \"Octavarium\", \"Systemathic Chaos\", or even \"Falling into Infinity\". I have liked them very much, but there are things I don't like.* I DO like (a lot) some of the songs, such as \"Beneath the Surface\", \"Breaking All Illusions\", \"False Awakening Suite\", \"The Looking Glass\", \"Illumination Theory\", \"On The Backs of Angels\", and I don't actually dislike or hate any song in particular. But that's because John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess are amazing musicians and songwriters, and everything they do will have a certain standard, which is very high. James LaBrie, John Myung, and Mike Mangini of course will sound good, but as far as everyone knows, they don't contribute very much to the songwriting or production process of Dream Theater, and so what happens, is that Petrucci and Rudess start to sound a little repetitive and uninspired (in my opinion), which is totally normal, and Dream Theater as a whole ends up sounding like that, with a few glimpses of brilliance, when in the past it was the other way around. When it first happened, I actually \"blamed\" and became more angry with Portnoy than with the rest of the guys, but later I realized that maybe he was right about the DT cycle. They write an album, tour, rest, and write a \"new\" album, which has the same overall sound but with different song names and album covers. In the past, every new album sounded VERY different to the other ones. To my ears, only up until \"Black Clouds...\" they started to sound a little similar to the prior album, but that's ok, because that was what they felt around that short period of time. I don't blame either of the two positions (Portnoy's and DT's); I actually understand both of them. But recently, I've felt like one of the following things would do a lot of good for the artistic side of the band (the economic aspect is very different, however): a) They take a little hiatus. They release some solo albums or other projects, Liquid Tension Experiment reunites for some shows or an album, they listen to the contemporary prog scene (Animals as Leaders, Periphery, Tesseract, Plini, The Aristocrats, Haken) and draw some inspiration and learn new things, and they break the DT cycle. b) They call Mike Portnoy back. Paul McCartney had John Lennon, David Gilmour had Roger Waters, and John Petrucci needs Mike Portnoy. I don't have anything personal against Mike Mangini (maybe, but that's another story haha), but the best Dream Theater there ever was had Mike Portnoy, and I'd like to see that again before I die. Just to be clear, John Petrucci is one of my three favorite guitarists and musicians of the whole world, so there's no reason to think that I'm against him or Dream Theater in any way. I will ALWAYS love Dream Theater... I just liked them with Mike Portnoy a little more. *I haven't finished listening to \"The Astonishing\", but, so far, the feeling is the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. What follows is my OPINION. They are not the same band. Portnoy was an essential part of that band. Losing Rudess? They could easily bounce back from that. Losing Labrie? Eh, it would take an album or two, but it could work. Losing Myung? Very tough, but they could get someone. Losing Petrucci? No, they'd be done. Mangini said that he wasn't trying to be Portnoy, but MP left a hole that needs to filled by a drummer with the same charisma. Mangini doesn't perform or write with any of the power or sheer joy that MP did. Remember that Portnoy wrote a lot of songs and had a considerable amount of creative control. His songs coincided well with Petruccis writing and now, it's mostly Petrucci doing the writing and it feels like half of what DT usually brought to the table. Petrucci has definitely improved as a guitar player. He's always seemed to evolve, but with \"The Astonishing\" I've noticed some cool nuances in his playing that I've never heard before. Labrie has deteriorated, but thats no surprise. I love him as a singer, he's got a great voice, but the band needs to accommodate him better. Rudess could use a rejuvenation. In all honesty, I think that the musicians of Dream Theater are in a rut. I thought that their latest album was OK, but it's no masterpiece. But that's what I think I myself need as a fan to really embrace Post- Portnoy DT. I need another Images & Words or Metropolis Pt. 2. Something that will legitimately \"wow\" me and constantly call me back to it. ",
