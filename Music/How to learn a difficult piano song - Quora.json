            "answer_text": "The same way anyone learns any difficult subject, such as some aspects of physics or advanced mathematics: in small increments, like a mosaic, or a jig-saw puzzle, making all pieces fit correctly, and hoping that all the pieces are indeed parts of the puzzle you are solving, and not from another puzzle (in which case you will be wasting your time!). Unfortunately there is no useful theory of education or learning as yet. Experts have been working for centuries on this question, and have come away empty-handed. Each and everyone of us learns differently. One has to be interested, to begin with, and motivated. It is important to have moral support from family and peers and friends. Learning is a lonely occupation, and we are born to be lazy. To put it in an extreme context, few of us (certainly not me) believe, like Dr.Samuel Johnson did, that the driving force of life is an overwhelming thirst for knowledge. However, I believe that learning HOW to learn is an individual\u2019s obligation to self and civilized society. In a subtle sense, you have answered your own question. You said \u201clearn a difficult song\u201d., implying that there are \u201ceasier songs\u201d . Learn the easy ones first, then progress incrementally to the more difficult ones. In reality, you need skills and tools to acquire knowledge, bit by bit. You need time, ability to read notation, ability to hear, ability to dissect (analyze), ability to judge what you are achieving. You need to know something about theory, harmony, styles of music, structure of music. You would benefit from expert guidance from people who are qualified. It would help if you did some reading and some listening on your own. ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t take a short cut and just find a way to to be able to play a difficult song in one minute, but you can learn it easier. A good thing to do is to play each hand separately and put them together when you\u2019re comfortable enough with them slowly to not miss any small things you need to play. It sounds like it needs more time since you have to practice 2 separate hands, but it actually takes less time, because if you play your piece separately, you\u2019ll go much slower at learning the piece and make small mistakes more often.
