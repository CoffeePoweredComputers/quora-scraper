            "answer_text": "It really depends on what style of singing suits your voice and what the audition is for, but it's good to choose songs which reflect the range of your voice with some challenging parts - like switching from head to chest voice - if you can sing them well. And you can find plenty of videos online to help with voice training. Also pick songs that you know you can do well and enjoy singing as then you will appear more at ease and confident. Choose songs that relate to the role you're auditioning for that are well known but try not to pick the same ones everyone goes for. If you tell me what you're auditioning for I can maybe suggest some songs ",
