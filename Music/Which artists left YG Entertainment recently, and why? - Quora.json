            "answer_text": "2019 has been a hell of a year for YG, from the Burning Sun scandal to the B.I scandal, but even after that, they\u2019ve had quite a few artists leave in the few months of 2019. Kang Sung Hoon - He made an official note on Sechskies fan caf\u00e9 saying he would not be continuing group activities and after long consideration, he terminated his contract with YG. His health was really taking a toll on him, and his group members, he decided to leave for the best. He proceeded to then apologize to his fans but is thankful for the support. \u201cI sincerely thank all of those who have supported me, Kang Sung Hoon of Sechskies for a long time.\u201d 2. Rapper one - He left because he wanted to focus on his music. Before joining YG entertainment, he was a part of D-Business entertainment as a hip hop duo with Kim Samuel. The following year he left to go to YG entertainment. He made an official statement on July 17 stating, \u201cI wanted to focus on my music. It\u2019s difficult to make music alone at home and I thought I could share my music with more people. This year I plan on focusing on my music activities. However, I am currently promoting alone since my contract with YG expired. I will be working alone for the time being focusing on music.\u201d  3. Three YG Trainee\u2019s - These Trainees left YG to sign a contract with OUI entertainment. The three trainees are; Kang Seok Hwa, Hidaka Mahiro, and Wang Jyun Hao. They were supposed to debut with a group called TREASURE 13(the group with the killer DNA cover), but now the group's debut has been delayed indefinitely. They all left during August and September. They are currently going to hold a fansign on November 3rd. You should totally support them!  ~ Jess the insomniac teen ",
