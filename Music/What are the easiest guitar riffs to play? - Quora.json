            "answer_text": "I play guitar since I was 10 y old. Im currently 18. I sterted already from hard solos and riffs, but of course I had to learn the basic ones too.The following riffs are probably the easier riffs I ever played: { Nothing Else Matters - Metallica (1st part of intro, used in several parts of the music)  [Fingering]  { Iron Man - Black Sabbath (Intro and base) [Picking]  { Smoke On The Water - Deep Purple (Intro and base) [Power Chords]  { Come As You Are - Nirvana (Intro and Base) [Picking]   If you are just starting and want something easy to get skilled, I yould like to suggest: 1) For fingering: 'Nothing Else Matters (Metallica) -> Only introduction for beginning, cool for getting some coordenation; Don't worry about learning it on the Hard Mode right at beginning. Start it from basic, you can skill up this music later'Stairway To Heaven (Lez Zeppelin) -> Only basic introduction for beginning, a nice song for starting on fingering if you're able for 2) For Picking:'Fear of The Dark (Iron Maiden) -> You can learn until the base, right before the the fast \"tananana\" after what the music gets harder'Come As You Are (Nirvana) -> Ok, it's so easy, but seems many people has a little difficult to sing while playing and this music is a good one for training it 3) For Power Chords:'T.N.T (AC/DC) -> A little bit hard to solo it, but the introduction and base are soft to learn'Back In Black (AC/DC) -> Well, it's good for training finger's speed on the shrill fast part'\u00c0 Sua Maneira (Capital Inicial) -> It's a Brazillian rock song, its intro and base are awesome for learning power chords rythm. Hope has been helpful! ",
