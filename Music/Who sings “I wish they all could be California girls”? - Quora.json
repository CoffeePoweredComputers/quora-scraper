            "answer_text": "Seriously? The fact that you know the line yet you didn\u2019t bother to google? You could have at least google that and the first thing the result will show is that it is by \u201cBeach Boys\u201d. Honestly, do you even bother at this point? Anyway, it is The Beach Boys - California Girls.  P.S. Next time, just google if you got the 2\u20133 words for the song lyrics. Edit: To the comment below - Yes, David Lee Roth also did record this song as a cover which was released in 1985 while the original one was released in 1965. I just checked the chart fact and the funniest thing is that these two songs peaked #3 on Billboard Hot 100. Talk about coincidence, huh? Both are great songs, regardless. ",
