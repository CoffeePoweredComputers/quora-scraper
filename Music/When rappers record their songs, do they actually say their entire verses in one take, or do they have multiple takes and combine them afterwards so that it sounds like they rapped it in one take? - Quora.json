            "answer_text": "Jay-Z is famous for being able to get his verses down in a single take. I don\u2019t know how consistently he is able to do this; I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t manage to do it every single time. Most rappers will need a few takes, or will have to redo a line or two here and there. Sometimes it\u2019s obvious when a splice occurs. There\u2019s a particularly interesting example in Chance the Rapper\u2019s verse on Kanye West\u2019s \u201cUltralight Beam.\u201d On the fourth time through the form, Chance sings the line, \u201cThis is my part, nobody else speak\u201d on the same C minor pentatonic scale he used at the beginning of his verse. Then he sings the same line again on the same melody, but with noticeably different voice quality. I\u2019m certain that the two lines come from two different takes. So why are they both in there? Here\u2019s my guess: in one take, Chance tumbled through the lines leading up to that line and ran out of breath after \u201cnobody else speak.\u201d So he had to stop, back up, and punch in another take starting at the top of the section. Maybe while listening back in the studio and deciding where to cross over from one take to another, Kanye and his co-producers heard both passes through the line, liked the effect, and decided to use both of them instead of whatever phrase was supposed to come next. I can\u2019t be sure that\u2019s what happened, but it\u2019s the likeliest explanation. Read an in-depth analysis of the entire verse: Chance the Rapper\u2019s verse on \u201cUltralight Beam\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on who they are, how hard their verse is, their recording style, and the engineer's preference. Personally I like to rap my whole verse in one take, and if necessary sometimes I\u2019ll use two clips, one for each half of the verse, although I do that only rarely. Some people like to go in four-bar chunks. Some record their verses a few dozen times, and then their engineer hand-picks each individual word. Four bars or one take is more prevalent in rap, while each individual word is more prevalent in pop music. If you wanna hear a super crazy one-take/first-try verse listen to Joyner Lucas\u2019 fast flow in his Suge remix.  Now, this is one hell of an impressive one-take. ",

As a rapper myself, I record my entire full verse in several takes and then choose the full take I like best, rather than chop and piece together best pieces of each full verse takes. It works for me, because I always recite how I deliver my verses before I head to the studio to record them. I've also engineered and coached other rappers in the past as well as singers. Some are able to control their breathing enough to go through their entire verse while others only like to record their verses piece by piece. ",

Sometimes songs by whole groups are recorded with only one member in the sound room singing their parts. They leave and another member enters for their turn. Repeat. When they need harmony, all members/backup singers, etc. are there together. The best take is used for the album. There have been times when listening to a rap song that I could tell exactly where the edit took place. Any group or singer that does it any other way is an exception. ",
