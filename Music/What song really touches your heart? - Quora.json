            "answer_text": "It depends, of you carve the words into a knife then it is really any song\u2026 To answer the serious question SOS that show your humanity, a song that shows that you care, or that shows you love. Of. Is intended for a female then use one that shows how you truly feel one that is serious but also is soft. If it is for a male use one that shows you are there for them, use one that shows that you respect him and love him. If it is one that you want to use to show your own weakness then stop for a moment and find a place inside, no one is weak, we just have low moments. You don't have to use a song to show someone your weakness, because it isn't really there. I am however going to assume you ran the romantic version of this question, and there is one last tip I can give, know your love, know their likes and dislikes, choose a song that shows your feelings, whilst fitting into their taste\u2026 It wouldn't work for me to show a 1D fan any sort of heavy metal song about love.

            "answer_text": "Okay this is my opinion. I know every person has different taste and opinions but the only song that really touches me and gives me goosebumps is definitley Lost on You from LP. Normally i would go for songs from the 60\u2019s 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s. But Lost on You gives me a different kind of feeling. Everytime i hear it on the radio it makes me very emotional because of the lyrics and background music and vocals. Maybe it's because when the song came out i was in a bad place and the lyrics are very relatable with the situation i was in with. That was 3 years ago and now i have a completely different life (in a positive way). But stil sometimes when i'm alone i put on a headphone and listen to it 2\u20133 times just to make sure that what i felt few years ago was real. And still it touches me and takes me back to that place. ",
