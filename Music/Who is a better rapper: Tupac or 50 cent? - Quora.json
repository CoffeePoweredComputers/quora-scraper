            "answer_text": "i think that tupac is better than 50 cent,in my opinion he has a much better style of rapping,and although 50 cent is one of my favourite rappers i much prefer tupac songs,and given that tupac died at a much younger age than what 50 cent is now i would say tupac has achieved more than 50 cent and i prefer tupacs music because it sounds to me like tupac had more experiences that make a good rap song than 50 has had and tupacs music has had more fame than 50 cents which is interesting in a way given that \u2018pac and 50 have came from a a similar background with them both being natives of new York were they started their rap careers and they have both been involved in a criminal life and have bo been involved in one way or another in drugs and they have been both victims and perpetrators of gun violence,ergo i think 50 could one day achieve the same legendary status in hip hop that tupac has (but i want to add that just because a lot of tupacs best songs have been released posthumously,i don't think his death has made any difference to how his music has been received and it doesn't make any difference to the overall success of a song if the artist is still around or not when they came out he still performed his music with his usual energy and style like in his live at the house of blues concert that tupac gave his last performance in and shows him at his best but sadly it was to be the last we'd ever see him as he was dead in a matter of weeks from this stellar performance, i can only hope and pray that nothing similar would happen to 50 cent and he has the chance to enjoy his life and fame which he has been doing for a longer time than many other rappers in a similar position to him,but if you see what i mean,you have 2 new York born rappers with the same life experiences to put into their music (and both tupac and 50 cent have been helped in their careers and had their music produced by Dr dre who in my opinion was he best hip hop producer who was around in tupacs time and who then went on to greater things and started his own label and signed and produced some of today's best rap artists like Eminem,the game,rakim and 50 cent ,and it is clear to me that we will be taking about 50 cent in years to come when we are discussing the best rappers of the 2000's (p.s,not all rappers have to have had a criminal background be it in violence,drugs or havingbeen shot multiple times to achieve legendary status (take Eminem as one example,he might not be known for his clean living but i haven't heard of him being involved in any serious crime or been shot up multiple times) but he has gone on to be the most successful white rapper ever produced ",

            "answer_text": "Tupac by far. While both have have good beats, Tupac\u2019s lyrics far surpass 50 cent\u2019s. He has more wholesome songs and a larger and more diverse range of music. While 50 cent mainly focuses on money and girls and other superficial things. While Tupac rapped about those things, he also raps about black power and self respect. On songs like \u201cKeep Ya Head Up\u201d he raps about women and encourages his brothers in the black community to be better. Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?I think it's time to kill for our womenTime to heal our women, be real to our womenAnd if we don't we'll have a race of babiesThat will hate the ladies, that make the babiesAnd since a man can't make oneHe has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one On the other hand 50 cent\u2019s verses about women go more along the line of this As soon as I come through the door, she get to pulling on my zipperIt's like it's a race who could get undressed quickerIsn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch 'em in thongs?Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone While 50 cent\u2019s songs are still good to listen to, he doesn\u2019t have the depth in his lyrics that Tupac has and he doesn\u2019t have the same rapping prowess and soothing voice. Despite this I want to make it clear that I am also a fan of 50 cent and he is still good in his own right. ",
