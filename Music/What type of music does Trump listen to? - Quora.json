            "answer_text": "Hippie stuff. Seriously Donald Trump might be all about the business at face value but when he decides to put some tunes on he likes a bit of CSNY and particularly the work of Neil Young \"He's got something very special. I've listened to his music for years and I've seen him before that, but I went to the concert where they were honoring Bob Dylan years ago at Madison Square Garden and Neil got up and totally brought the house down. There was nobody close. He's performed for me at my casinos over the years and he just brings it down. I've met him on occasions and he's a terrific guy. \u2026 His voice is perfect and haunting. He's 63 and I don't think it's changed.\" Neil doesn\u2019t seem to reciprocate the love. Although apparently he also likes the old style crooners \"There's so much great music. For me, I'd have to say it's a toss up between Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, and Elton John. I never get tired of listening to them and probably never will\u2026 Any album by any of them is bound to be fantastic. And also Eminem who he thinks is \u201cfantastic\u201d along with Toots and the Maytals. He\u2019s just a regular hippie, crooner, reggae, hip hop fan.

            "answer_text": "From what I can see, he doesn\u2019t seem to care much for the arts, theater, or classical music nor does he promote American genres of music. The Obama\u2019s had several specials with different artists. I think one was the blues, another was country western music, and another highlighted songs from famous movies. It\u2019s been awhile and I don\u2019t remember exact details but suffice it to say the Obama\u2019s tried to bring the arts to more people, not less. Maybe 45 really doesn\u2019t prefer any particular genre of music or maybe he just has too short of attention span? It\u2019s odd how he claims to have so much money but he doesn\u2019t seem to have any of the habits of one who appreciates the finer things in life. Many people of substance acquire art for their private gallery and have an awareness and appreciation for great pieces that will appreciate in value. The same people often are foodies and really enjoy a meal by an \u201ciron chef.\u201d A well done steak slathered in ketchup is NOT a gourmet meal and using the large gold WH candelabras on either end of a large banquet table of lukewarm fast food is not a testimony to good taste. Charlie the tuna could do a better job. ",

In all seriousness he listens to the kind of music that you and I listen to: Beethoven, Wagner, Anton Bruckner, Hans Hotter, Herbert von Karajan, Clemens Krauss, Elly Nelly, Hans Pfitzner, Li Stadelmann and Richard Strauss to name but a few.

This might be why when you seek an answer to that question, you get lots of quotes from his books or interviews of very shallow enjoyment of a wide range of music. There\u2019s not a single recorded moment in print or video of Trump discussing music he really loves and why. I\u2019m inclined to believe Mr. Jillette and others, and say that Trump just doesn\u2019t get music at all, and sees it as background noise. ",

It was quite a disappointment to see that he doesn\u2019t know the words of the NATIONAL ANTHEM, nor does he know behaviors expected of a person when it plays. And he complains when a person takes a knee. ",
