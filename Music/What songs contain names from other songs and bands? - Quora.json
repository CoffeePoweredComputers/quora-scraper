            "answer_text": "The first one that comes to my mind is early Better Than Ezra\u2019s Teenager. \u201cWrap yourself in black Listen to The Cure 'Love-line' won't call back They don't know, they don't care, they don't see, but I do\u201d I heard a live version later that referenced Green Day.  This one is memorable because it shows some frustration towards oblivious fans. Rick Springfield\u2019s name was often mixed up with Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen became famous prior to Springfield and the names were often confused. So Springfield wrote a song about it. He\u2019s written far better lyrics than this but it gets the point across in a humorous way. \u201cShe called me Bruce, BruceI can hear her calling Bruce, BruceI can hear her calling Bruce, BruceI can hear herMy name is Rick I'm gonna stick it to ya babe\u201d  Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s Sweet Home Alabama references Neil Young for being outspoken about the south\u2019s attitude toward segregation. This song is considered controversial by some and is provided only in the spirit of answering the question. \u201cWell, I heard Mister Young sing about herWell, I heard ol' Neil put her downWell, I hope Neil Young will rememberA Southern man don't need him around anyhow\u201d  Back to BTE; A Lifetime., references R.E.M. \u201cAnd I know I wasn't right, but it felt so good.And your mother didn't mind, like I thought she would.And that REM song was playing in my mind.And three and a half minutes, felt like a lifetime\u201d  I guess the Weezer reference to the rock pioneer is kind of obvious in Buddy Holly.  Texas singer-songwriter Pat Green references 3 late Texans in Nightmare. Buddy Holly, Stevie Ray Vaughn and Townes Van Zant. If you\u2019re not a fan of today\u2019s cheesy country music, I recommend Pat Green for his humble, fun, down to earth southern songwriting. \u201cSo I cried \"Oh Moses, bring a flood from the Red Red SeaBring back Towns Van Zandt and my heroes back to me.'Cause I can play their songs but it ain't the way they do,It ain't the way they do.\" I had a nightmare, a nightmare, it was a nightmare. Now Buddy Holly was ridin' on the wind.Stevie Ray well he was too.And when their star came tumbling to the groundWasn't a thing all the king's horses and all the king's men could do.\u201d  Finally, one of my favs; Hey, Hey, My, My; referencing \u201cThe King\u201d and Johnny Rotten (of Sex Pistols fame), tied together by the bonds of rock music.
