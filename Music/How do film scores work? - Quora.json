            "answer_text": "I love this question because I\u2019m planning to be one very soon one day! So how it works is that you have your orchestra set in place with the strings in the front: Violins - (long held) - the importance of a situation Violins - (pizzacato) - having fun or interesting conversations [Mainly in cartoon films] Violins - (rapid/rushing effect) - helps impact how it feels throughout the problem [Rushing water means violins play fast like in the waterfall scene from A Goofy Movie] Violins - (bright/long held) - has the influence in empathy Violas - (long held) - helps provide a deeper perspective of an important situation [has a lower tone from the violins] Cellos - Creates a better outlook to something serious or important Double Basses - Helps direct a very serious or aware moment [Situations like if something isn\u2019t right or you\u2019re having a very serious conversation with someone] Woodwind is the middle row with: Flutes - (normal) - Overview\u2019s touching moments on how someone feels during empathy Flutes - (swing off) - It\u2019s that quick flute playing during situations that leap into action especially in battle scenes I call it a flute swing off because it swings up and down as it plays and this helps direct movement to a problem for example (running, falling, leaping, etc.) wwwwwooowwwww Claranets - gives a deeper perspective of a sad or touching moments (including empathy) Bassoons - creates the importance of a touching situation also creates aware moments in situations as well. Now the back row is the brass with: Trumpets - helps give sudden moments of powerful enthusiasm or rapid scenes Trombones - helps overview the problem Tubas - makes the situation of a problem worse or even more sudden! French horns - highlights the situation that becomes worse. The back row percussion instruments are: Cymbals - gives a loud response to a situation Bass drums - directs a sudden oncoming moment Cymbal Scratch - It\u2019s that pow sound that scratches like (PWWWSHHHHHH) which helps organise a sudden thing happening next Ding Dong - A ding dong or xylophone type instrument plays a lot in catastrophe scenes if you\u2019re in danger and makes the situation sudden or worse than it sounds. Choir - Oh yes the choir overviews an epic or sudden moment especially the films for example: (Star Wars, Cutthroat Island, etc.) Now the front percussion is the piano in which directs a beautiful scenary or empathetic moment. The harp just gives an overview perspective and has that beautiful scenary effect in a film. Now major is happy and minor is sad which I got taught in music class back in high school but I don\u2019t do school anymore so major is like saving the day and minor is a problem occurring you hear the minor key play during the battle or severe situations then major comes in when someone saves the day and the characters are cheering. So during chase or rushing scenes you have the rushing violins and rapid trumpets and the trombone just plays long notes for overviewing the problem and if you\u2019re about the fall, leap up high then the flute swing off enters in wwwwwooowwwww and is played in a minor key and then when you did it or make it in time the major key with trumpets playing characters have done it successfully. Often the loudest scoring happens in the opening or ending scenes because it helps have that start or finish off effect. That\u2019s what the brief idea of film scoring is all about! ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not a film music scholar, but have always loved film music. I've done a bit of amateur composition, and studied Film music at Berklee School of Music for a few semesters, earning a certificate in Music Production for Film, Television, and Video Gaming.  I would say film music \"works\" because it underscores the action and dialog of a film. It lends emotional information about what the writer/director is intending in the scene without distracting from the film itself.  With really good film music, you literally forget it's actually there. It dissolves into the full experience of the film.  Bad film music draws attention to itself and away from the music. It's quite an art to write music that both works with the film but is not pulling the listeners focus from the film, like a purely symphonic work would do. It can't be that demanding. The score of a film is more often one of the last parts of the film to come together. All the footage has been shot, and often the film has been edited as well.   The composer meets with the director, and the film is \"spotted.\" This means they watch the film together (often with other creative folks as well) and they make notes of where music will go, and maybe some rough ideas of what the music should \"do\" there.   There may have even been some 'stock' music roughed in with the first cut to give an idea of what the director wants. With this list of scenes and what music goes where, sometimes with very exact cues of dramatic events, the composer goes away and works for 6-8 weeks (for a feature length film) and cranks out the score under a fair amount of pressure.  Its really quite interesting what can be done with music to make sure musical events happen at the exact time the scene events do, which is often more critical than you realize.  The tempo (speed) of the music is often precisely adjusted, sometimes with changing time signatures, frequently, so that a particular musical phrase falls where it needs to in the film. The real art is weaving all the phrases and calculating the tempi so that musical ideas end when the tempo needs a sudden change or the scene ends, etc. etc.   Even with all that calculation, a lot of the composed work ends up on the cutting room floor, and often the director has considerable back and forth discussion with the composer to trim certain portions as its decided certain scenes don't work as planned, or certain sections need to be changed according to the director's vision.  You have to be very detached about what you create in the film music business. In can come together in a variety of ways, but at some point, the producer gathers a recording orchestra (often delegated to another person on the directors staff who finds union musicians, negotiates the rates, etc.) The film score is recorded in a specialized studio, sometimes with the film itself projected in the background for the composer to see, to help get timing exact.  Sometimes it's recorded in parts, sometimes all at once... all depends on the production schedule. Finally, in a separate process, the recording is mastered along with the high-resolution video (usually) along with the foley (sound effects) and the recorded dialog, and the final master is created and ready for printing and distribution. I hope some find this interesting and useful. ",
