            "answer_text": "10. The Omen The wife of an American diplomat, Robert Thorne, gives birth to a dead child. Her husband decides not to tell his wife the sad news and takes another baby instead. The child, who was named Damien, grows up in the family as a native. But in fact, his soul is cursed from birth. After all, Damien is the antichrist. Another classic horror movie is embodying the idea of \u200b\u200bfear of children. The contrast between the angelic face of the young actor and his sinister deeds really caught the viewer. 9. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Girl Sally and her friends go to Texas to visit grandfather's grave. On the way, they get to the farm, where an extraordinary family lives, working in a slaughterhouse. Guests are invited to dinner, but it turns out that the owners are not opposed to hunting people. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre became the prototype of all slashers, surpassing Halloween and other prominent representatives of the genre. To date, the first part may seem rustic, although there are quite dark scenes in it. But the picture also has many sequels, and in 2017 there was a prequel about the origin of the main villain, nicknamed Leather Face. By the way, this character has a real prototype - maniac Ed Gein. 8. Halloween Michael Myers has been in hospital since childhood because he killed his sister. But once he escapes, Myers put on a white mask and begins to terrorize a group of teenagers. The work of John Carpenter launched a wave of slashers - horror films, where a masked maniac preys on teens. Similar paintings even became a symbol of the eighties. And Halloween itself has, over time, turned into one of the longest-running horror franchises in history. In 2018, the next part was released, which continued the events of the very first film, ignoring the sequels. 7. Night of the Living Dead Barbara arrives with her brother at the grave of his father. And right at the cemetery, they are attacked by an eerie man in rags. The girl manages to escape, and soon she finds herself in a house where several other strangers gathered. And around begins the invasion of the living dead. The film by the novice director George Romero was the first story in which zombies were shown in the usual form today - earlier this term was referred only to voodoo magic. Interestingly, Romero himself did not use it. The film has many sequels and remakes, and the idea of \u200b\u200bthe mindless living dead, which are primarily dangerous because of their quantity, has gone into popular culture. 6. Jaws The local police sheriff discovers on the shore the remains of a girl torn to pieces by a massive white shark. The number of victims is growing every day, but the city leadership does not dare to notify residents about the danger. Then the main character teams up with a shark hunter and an oceanologist to catch a monster together. Steven Spielberg\u2019s film made a splash at the box office, paying off dozens of times and turning the term \u201cblockbuster\u201d into an independent genre. And all the more surprising, this is a story about a huge monster devouring people. 5. The Exorcist The 12-year-old daughter of actress Chris MacNeil has strange seizures. Moreover, during seizures, she behaves aggressively, and then wholly begins to speak in a male voice and move strangely. Doctors do not detect any physical problems, and then it becomes clear: the girl is obsessed with the devil. The film by William Fridkin is widely regarded as a classic of horror. The director set his task in every way to scare the viewer, for which they used shaking scenery, terrible makeup, and many special effects. And many considered the scene of the devil's exile even too realistic, although Max von Sydow, the performer of the role of Merrin\u2019s father, said that he did not believe in evil spirits at all. Well, the moment where the girl's arms and legs are bent is firmly in history: it was copied in dozens of horror films, and then parodied in many comedies.  4. Rosemary\u2019s Baby Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse relocate to a prestigious area of \u200b\u200bNew York. They quickly become friends with new neighbours, and it seems that everything is going well in life. But once Rosemary has a dream about how a demon rapes her. And soon the girl discovers that she is pregnant. Director Roman Polansky approached to the production of his debut film in Hollywood very carefully, paying attention to the smallest details in the plot. The author wanted no one to doubt the realism of what was happening. As a result, the picture perfectly combines the plot of a classic horror film about a satanic cult and a reflection of the real fear of motherhood. 3. The Thing Polar explorers find an alien organism in Antarctica. It soon turns out that he attacks people and can take shape and even copy the behaviour of any living creature. Now all the inhabitants of the station suspect each other, trying to figure out a monster. The film by John Carpenter is based on the movie \"Something from Another World\" of 1951. But the remake managed to surpass the original both in terms of visual presentation and in psychological stress. 2. Alien The Nostromo spacecraft receives a signal from the unexplored planet LV \u2011 426. Crew members assume they are being asked for help. But soon the team is faced with a terrible alien who kills characters one by one. With the cult film of Ridley Scott, a many-year xenomorph franchise began, on which various directors worked. But still, the sequels are more reminiscent of gloomy fighters. And the first film is a fantastic horror where a monster hunts for heroes in a confined space. By the way, initially, the author planned to kill all the characters of the film, which would exclude the possibility of continuation. But the producers opposed such a move and forced him to change the ending. 1.The Shining Writer Jack Torrance is in a creative crisis. To earn extra money, and at the same time to get distracted, he gets a job as a caretaker at the Overlook hotel closed for the winter and moves there with his family. Jack plans to spend this time writing a new novel. But soon, terrible things begin to happen at the hotel. The author of the original book, Stephen King, was unhappy with the adaptation of Stanley Kubrick. But still, the director managed to perfectly convey the mystical and frightening atmosphere of the hotel, in which ghosts live. Well, the fantastic performance by Jack Nicholson makes the movie a must-see. ",

            "answer_text": "Best Horror Movies : 1. The Exorcist (1973) The Exorcist is based on a book which is based on real life of a boy named Roland Doe who was possessed by demons in 1949. The exorcism was so scary that there have been books written on people who witnessed it.  2. 1408 (US), 2007 Based on a short story of the same name by Stephen King, this psychological horror creates a lasting impression. Don't expect any white-faced apparitions with long black hair. But watch it for the brilliantly twisted plot woven around a forbidden hotel room that does not any visitor leave alive. This film has three alternate endings apart from the one used in the film, none of which are the same as the original ending of the short story.  3. The Conjuring (2013) Ed and Lorraine Warren are real life paranormal investigators who claim that this case was exceptionally hard for them to deal with.  4.

There, they meet Peggy Hodgson, an overwhelmed single mother of four who tells the couple that something evil is in her home. Ed and Lorraine believe her story when the youngest daughter starts to show signs of demonic possession. As the Warrens try to help the besieged girl, they become the next targets of the malicious spirit.  5.The Exorcism Of Emily Rose (2005) This is based on the life of Anneliese Michel who was possessed by demons so strong that her exorcism took nearly an year to accomplish. It is one of the most famous exorcism movies and it is all real.  6.Silent House (2011) It is an independent American horror movie based on a real incident in Uruguay. If you like \"real time\" footage in your horror movies then this is it.  7. Sinister (2012) True-crime writer Ellison Oswald is in a slump; he hasn't had a best seller in more than 10 years and is becoming increasingly desperate for a hit. So, when he discovers the existence of a snuff film showing the deaths of a family, he vows to solve the mystery. He moves his own family into the victims' home and gets to work. However, when old film footage and other clues hint at the presence of a supernatural force, Ellison learns that living in the house may be fatal.  8.The Possession (2012) During a yard sale, Em, a young girl, comes across a dybbuk box and asks her father to buy it for her. She becomes increasingly obsessed with the box and begins exhibiting signs of being possessed.  9. Dead End (2003) A woman clad in white leads this family into a living nightmare in the woods. Driving to their in-laws house for Christmas dinner, Frank and his family get into an accident with a car driving the other way. When they come to, the other car is gone and they see a woman wearing all white carrying a baby and offer her a ride.  10. The OMEN Robert and his wife adopt Damien shortly after the death of their first born. Several mysterious events soon begin to plague them. A local priest reveals to Robert about his son's mysterious origin.  11.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre After picking up a traumatized young hitchhiker, five friends find themselves stalked and hunted by a deformed chainsaw-wielding killer and his family of equally psychopathic killers.  13.Insidious Series (chapter 1,2 and 3) The first two films center on a couple who, after their son mysteriously enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an astral plane, are continuously haunted by demons of the further until they take from the family what they want most: life. The third film, a prequel, focuses on the same psychic that helped the family this time come to the aid of a young girl who calls out to the dead. All plots are depicted as case files of demonologists.  *LOOKING UNDER THE BED* SPOOKY *_* ",

            "answer_text": "This is my personal top ten. I prefer horror that's also good drama, with psychologically interesting characters and a gradual build-up towards a climax rather than a succession of \"scary\" moments.  10. Paranormal Activity (2007)  The found footage formula had been used before, but it works very well in this low-budget production. It's as if you're watching the home video of two deceased persons. The setting in one house feels claustrofobic. It begins as a game with the ouija board, but it grows into something more threatening. The style is realist without background music. I prefer the Paramount alternate ending.  9. Dracula (1931)   There are a lot of adaptations of this classic vampire tale, but this version with Bela Lugosi is usually considered the best. While welcoming his guests the Transylvanian count  hears wolves crying. he says, \"Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make.\" Vampire tales during the Victorian era were full of symbolism, because explicit eroticism was taboo. 8. Frankenstein (1931)   Boris Karloff played the monster, using a lot of make-up and a false forehead. It's a tale of hubris. Two scientists want to create life by themselves, thus taking the place of God. One interpretation is that it has a homosexual undertone: two men creating life without the interference of a woman. The monster was predestined to be evil, because it has the brain of a deceased criminal.   7. The Others (2001)   The setting in an isolated environment, an old country house on the Channel Island Jersey, creates a gothic atmosphere. Because the children suffer from photosensitivity there is no light in the house. Darkness and fog have a symbolic meaning. Nicole Kidman plays a woman who tries to hold on to a potpourri of Catholic and superstitious conceptions, but who will, after going through a lot of fear, finally have to face the truth. 6. Carrie (1976)   Based on Stephen King's debut novel this is the story of a high school girl with telekinetic powers. She's terrorized by a Christian fundamentalist mother and bullied at school. Sissy Spacek has the leading role; the young John Travolta plays one of her schoolmates. 5. The Birds (1963)   This is the only Hitchcock film that doesn't use background music. Although it's in color the birds are black and white: crows and gulls. The idea comes from a short story by Daphne du Maurier. It's a childish fantasy. There are so many more birds than humans. What would happen if they attacked us? Tippi Hedren plays the leading role. 4. Rosemary's Baby (1968)   Traditionally horror stories were set in ancient castles or faraway woods. Novelist Ira Levin transported this to a modern apartment in New York. The film by Roman Polanski begins with a young couple moving in. Bit by bit it becomes clear that something is wrong with the place and with their neighbours. Mia Farrow plays the leading role. 3. Jaws (1975)   In this confrontation between culture and nature John Williams' two note ostinato suggests the lurking danger under the water. They had to do this because there were technical problems with the mechanical sharks. They avoided the color red in most of the film to enlarge the contrast with the blood. Just before Brody leaves to hunt for the great white shark his wife asks him what to tell the children. He replies with a euphemism: \"Tell them I'm going fishing.\" But is the boat big enough? 2. The Exorcist (1973)   The Assyrian demon Pazuzu appears first in Iraq (Mesopotamia). Then he moves to Washington D.C. He chooses a teenage girl (Linda Blair) as his victim to make the grown-ups around her doubt themselves. When she shows weird behavior they first try to find a medical explanation, until the mother (Ellen Burstyn) realizes that that thing upstairs isn't her daughter. They used a doll and a contortionist as a double for Linda Blair. Max von Sydow wore more make-up than she did to play the title character that was much older than he.  1. Psycho (1960)   The first act is told from the point of view of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Her interior monologue in the car goes from memories to imagining what they will say after finding out what she's done. Water is a recurring motive: the rain, the toilet, the shower scene - a brilliant piece of editing combined with the screeching strings of Bernard Herrmann. Anthony Perkins plays motel owner Norman Bates, whose hobby is stuffing birds. It's a psychological thriller, but at the same time it was the basis of a new subgenre of horror: the slasher movie. ",

            "answer_text": "In the past 20 years, Asian horror has emerged as a major force in the genre. While American horror stagnated, churning out countless remakes (many of which are based on these Asian films), A-horror movies have been a source of innovation. Korean horror, for example, practically invented a new sub-genre of revenge-themed psychological thrillers, pioneered by Chan-wook Park. On top of that, something about the cultural difference makes these films extra-scary to Western audiences. Even a run-of-the-mill Japanese horror film can scare the pants off of a Western viewer who has never seen the style. Here is a list of my top Asian horror movies\u2026 #1 Shutter  Photography is a little creepy when you get right down to it. Shutter examines the phenomenon of spirit photography and the blurry line between what is real and what appears on film. The 2004 supernatural horror from Thailand is about a photographer named Thun and his girlfriend Jane who begin to find strange things in their photographs after they flee the scene of an accident. Soon they find that their friends are also being haunted, and it's getting worse. The cinematography and special effects are both realistic and creepy. The storyline is surprisingly surprising, and the eerie atmosphere is augmented by some terrifying imagery. #2 Ju-on: The Grudge  This terrifying 2002 Japanese horror by Takashi Shimizu is the third installment of the Ju-on series and by far the most successful. It was remade in America in 2004, becoming one of the most successful Asian horror remakes. It also spawned several sequels, including the recent Sadako vs. Kayako. The film is about a ghost named Kayako who basically kills anyone she comes into contact with, and a woman named Rika Nishina who is trying to uncover the origin of the curse. The imagery is terrifying, bolstered by the fantastic cinematography and an unnerving atmosphere. This film is particularly frightening to Western audiences who are used to ghosts following a certain set of rules. Kayako does not follow these rules. #3 Ringu  Ringu is about a video that kills you when you watch it. Specifically, you die seven days after seeing the video, murdered by an absolutely terrifying ghost named Sadako. Many films have been spawned from this original, including the American remake and the recent Sadako vs. Kayako. The story of the 1998 original by Hideo Nakata is a bit more fleshed-out than in the American remake. The plot makes a bit more sense and is more effective because of it. The killer video itself is also more fear-inducing and less art house than in the remake. Ringu subtly pokes at the fourth wall, drawing the audience into the horror in a way that few films can. #4 A Tale of Two Sisters  After spending time in a mental institution, two sisters return home to their father and stepmother in this 2003 South Korean psychological horror. On top of having to deal with an unhinged stepmother, it seems the sisters have a haunting to contend with. Chilling, tense, and full of suspense, this film captures the audience's attention throughout. The plot is twisting, keeping the viewer guessing. The cinematography creates an eerie atmosphere which is compounded by some unnerving imagery. This film was later remade as The Uninvited in America. #5 Noroi: The Curse  Found footage is taken to its terrifying pinnacle in this 2005 Japanese horror. Disparate footage is pieced together to tell the story of a supernatural investigation team looking into events connected to the legend of the kagutaba ancient demon. The film builds tension slowly, creating a tense atmosphere of suspense. As the seemingly unrelated events begin to fit together, the audience is left terrified at what is unveiled. #6 The Eye  A blind woman getting an operation which gives her the ability to see for the very first time sounds like a feel-good Lifetime movie. This 2002 Hong Kong horror is anything but. It turns out that looking through the eyes of a dead person has some unintended consequences. All sorts of ghosts start appearing, and seeing is believing. Eerie imagery is the name of the game in this film, augmented by an excellent acting performance by Angelica Lee. #7 Audition  Okay, so holding a fake audition to help you pick a second wife is pretty shady. Even so, Shigeharu Aoyama does not deserve what happens to him in this 1999 Japanese horror. The atmosphere is tense and gritty in this film by Takashi Miike. Unlike his later film Ichi the Killer, Audition is not overly gory. The film is artistically beautiful and truly terrifying, something that no horror fan can afford to miss. #8 Dark Water  In this 2002 Japanese horror, newly divorced Yoshimi Matsubara and the daughter she is trying to keep custody of are forced to move into an old apartment. She notices a dark spot on the ceiling where water appears to be getting in. Strange things start occurring; meanwhile, Yoshimi is struggling to balance work and single motherhood. Directed by Hideo Nakata (of Ringu), the film is deliberately slow-paced and tense. Between ever-building tension and eerie imagery, this film instills a deep sense of dread in the viewer. The film favors creating an atmosphere of fear using subtlety as opposed to jump scares. #9 I Saw the Devil  The gritty realism of this 2010 South Korean horror is terrifying in a way different than most other horror films. The film tells the story of special agent Kim Soo-hyun seeking revenge for the murder of his pregnant wife. What makes the film unique is how it puts you into the head space of a true monster. As Soo-hyun starts to become more monstrous himself in his quest to destroy the psychopathic serial killer who killed his wife, the audience is taken with him. It takes a while for the fear to set in, but when it does, it hits you hard. #10 Pulse  In addition to being completely terrifying, this 2001 Japanese horror by Kiyoshi Kurosawa is an interesting social commentary. Humans really do not know the long-term effects of constant manipulation of the electromagnetic spectrum (radio, electricity, wireless, etc.), nor do we know the impact of constant media saturation and connectivity. This premise serves as the bedrock for horrifying imagery, frightening cinematography, and a deeply creepy atmosphere that sticks with you. The American remake, as is often the case, just did not do the film justice. #11 Reincarnation  Directed by Takashi Shimizu of Ju-on fame, this 2005 Japanese horror follows actress Yuka as she stars in a horror movie based on true events. A father murdered his entire family and everyone else at a hotel while filming the entire event. Now 20 years later, a film is being shot on location at the infamous hotel. The film begins slowly and gradually accelerates so that by the climax, it feels like a freight train going full speed. Overall, the plot has a balance of predictable and unpredictable twists that keep the viewer guessing without feeling too lost. The cinematography and imagery are eerie without feeling too familiar. Not a gore fest by any stretch, this film relies on psychological suspense and atmosphere to terrify the audience. #12 Three... Extremes  This film is actually an anthology of three short stories, each directed by a master of Asian horror. Famed directors Fruit Chan (Made in Hong Kong), Chan-wook Park (Oldboy), and Takashi Miike (The Audition) each take the audience through a unique horror experience. The film features beautiful cinematography and truly disturbing subject matter. Chan's story, \"Dumplings,\" involves youth-restoring dumplings made from a very special recipe. Park's segment (called \"Cut\") is a brutal and gory tale revolving around a director and a former movie extra gone mad. Miike's \"Box\" is an artistically stunning yet terrifying ghost story with layers of symbolism. This is truly a cinematic masterpiece of the horror genre. #13 Into the Mirror  An ex-police officer working as a security guard notices something strange at the department store where he works in this 2003 South Korean horror. He is drawn into the mystery of a series of murders linked to mirrors. Great cinematography creates an atmosphere that is consistently creepy and tense. Without being too gory, Into the Mirror is a frightening film that shouldn't be overlooked. Unfortunately, the American remake starring Kiefer Sutherland just fell flat, failing to live up to the original. #14 Battle Royale  Battle Royale is a gore fest. It is perhaps the gore fest. As part of some Draconian law aimed to prevent delinquency, 42 high school students are unwittingly dragged to a deserted island. There, they must battle to the death. The last one standing gets to live. Each receives a bag of supplies and a random weapon that ranges in effectiveness from machine gun to frying pan. Oh yeah, and they also all have collars that explode if they try any funny business. Surprisingly, this film is full of heart and human relationships. The characters that the audience gets to know end up being well-developed. You really do end up feeling for these kids and wanting them to live. Then, as soon as you start feeling that way, the horrifying reality of the situation reappears and someone gets gutted like a fish. #15 Rigor Mortis  The classic Chinese vampire movies of the 1980s are paid homage in this 2013 Hong Kong horror. The film reunites some of the cast from the original Mr. Vampire series to tell the story of a depressed former actor who goes to live in a housing tenement. There he is unexpectedly plunged into supernatural horror. The film is artistic, stylish, and atmospheric, choosing storyline and character development over scares. Rigor Mortis breaks away from many horror conventions while at the same time embracing age-old monsters and archetypes.\\ #16 Flu  This 2013 South Korean horror offers a realistic and grim portrayal of a modern city in a total epidemic outbreak. A highly communicable disease with a 100% fatality rate rips through a suburb of Seoul. As medical resources are overwhelmed and civil authority collapses, we are given a terrifying view of the worst-case scenario. The film centers around infectious disease specialist In-hye and rescue worker Ji-goo as they struggle to survive and save others. The acting is excellent and authentic, contributing greatly to the impact of the film. The story is well-executed, and the parade of horribles presented leaves the viewer imbued with totally rational fear about a very real, very possible threat. #17 Hide and Seek  This 2013 South Korean film follows Seong-soo as he searches for his missing brother. During said search, he discovers strange symbols on apartments which indicate that there might be additional residents hiding right under the noses of the normal tenants. This deeply creepy thriller leaves audiences looking over their shoulders as it steadily unfolds. The acting is compelling and believable, further contributing to the realism and suspense. *Images from Google* For my list of psychologically disturbing movies refer to : Rahul Bhaskaran's answer to What are some psychologically disturbing movies?

            "answer_text": "\u201cMaking the usual, unusual\u201d- the key feature of every horror fiction. There is a chill in the air that\u2019s tickling your spine, a strange draft that\u2019s banging doors shut and you know it\u2019s that the time of the year again and the yellow grimacing pumpkin season is upon us. No Halloween is complete without a dose of skin crawling, edge of the seat horror flicks. Like any other genre, like comedy or sci-fi, horror is pretty much individualistic. For some people, the disfigurement (like the Frankenstein\u2019s monster, zombies) gets the blood gushing, for others it\u2019s the pounding unknown fear of death or other creepy, crawly things like snakes, spiders, scorpions and more. There is a lot on the menu when it comes to the sinister and morbid, but really it all comes down to what you\u2019re in the mood for. Sometimes you want to watch something very edgy, nerve wracking, or catastrophic, while on certain days you just want to chill and enjoy a blend of horror with comedy. Just for laughs you know. And well, because you want a good night\u2019s sleep and not keep checking under the bed! So here\u2019s a list of top horror movies, right from the classics to the latest blockbusters, a perfect mix for every mood you might like to build up this Halloween. So grab your bucket of popcorn, snuggle in the old worn couch and don\u2019t forget the bloody Mary! The Silence of the Lambs- (1991)  Source: Google Images Why to choose me? I\u2019m one of those rare movies that tend to stay in your thoughts even after you\u2019ve watched it. I won many awards, including Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. I was directed by Jonathan Demme from a screenplay written by Ted Tally, adapted from Thomas Harris\u2019s 1988 novel of the same name and my cast included such names as Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, and Anthony Heald. What makes me different from the rest? Are you looking for a fantastic, haunting experience? Let me assure you, you will be terrified. I make a mean psychological horror that\u2019s frankly disturbing for the faint hearted. You\u2019ll remember the interplay between Starling and Lector long after the movie gets over\u200a\u2014\u200athey share an indefinable, dark understanding gives the film it\u2019s unforgettable and unsettling power. Army of Darkness- (1992)  Source: Google Images Why to choose me? Watch me without taking me too seriously. Yes, you are allowed to laugh as I\u2019m a horror-comedy film. There can be non-sardonic humor in modern day America. I was directed by Sam Raimi who co-wrote the script with Ivan Raimi, co-produced by Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell, with a cast including Campbell and Embeth Davidtz, how can I be a bore? What makes me different from the rest? People say I\u2019m a perfect blend of exciting action and comedy, this makes me unique in the history of cinema. I contain less of blood soaked insanity, and moreover come off as more of a thrilling adventurous film which doesn\u2019t lose the element of horror in it. Scream- (1996)  Source: Google Images Why to choose me? Wes Craven resurrected me in the slasher genre with this cheekily post-modern effort in the mid-90s. I work as a perfectly great, straightforward slasher in my own right, so even if you\u2019re not enough of a genre nut to spot all the references and homages, I am still terrifying. What makes me different from the rest? Wes Craven made an attempt to explore the integrity of cinema (the reel and the real life) and does not even skip a minute detail of it. Being startling in every sense, I maintain viewer\u2019s interest by using horror films as part of a deadly game. The Others- (2001)  Source: Google Images Why to choose me? If you\u2019re looking for a real essence of fear, unlike the patches of blood, or an eerie green glow in the sky which are just to grasp viewers\u2019 attention, you should rather go for the definite meaning of fear, which Amenabar expresses by re-teaching his audience that fear is actually caused by suggestion, not by the explicit images. What makes me different from the rest? The screenplay-by Amenabar himself- is known for its uniqueness as it\u2019s a mixture of inventive details and exalted dialogues. The Exorcism of Emily Rose- (2005)  Source: Google Images Why to choose me? I\u2019m a 2005 American supernatural horror trial film directed by Scott Derrickson and starring Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson. I\u2019m loosely based on the story of Anneliese Michel, which follows a self-proclaimed agnostic (Linney) who acts as defense counsel representing a parish priest (Wilkinson), accused by the state of negligent homicide after he performed an exorcism. What makes me different from the rest? \u201cDemons exist whether you believe in them or not,\u201d says the priest at the center of \u201cThe Exorcism of Emily Rose.\u201d With such exalted dialogues and sublimity, I tend to focus on the secular institution, the court, to decide a question that hinges on matters the court cannot have an opinion on. Let me assure you, your curiosity will make see this one right till the end. Get Out (2017)  Source: Google Images Why to choose me? I\u2019m a 2017 American horror film written and directed by Jordan Peele in his directorial debut. I stand out to be the most haunting and guarantee a blood curdling scream. I revolve around a black man, who uncovers a disturbing secret when he meets the family of his white girlfriend. What makes me different from the rest? While watching me you\u2019ll get plenty of real character evolution and a tight, overtoned dialogue that really gets under your skin. All this, together with a vision that leaves the audience introspect, contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole. I\u2019m a delicious witty slice of cinematic paranoia served with purgative humor that aptly reflects the political times we all are living in. A Quiet Place (2018)  Source: Google Image Why to choose me? I\u2019m a 2018 American post-apocalyptic science fiction horror film directed by John Krasinski, who stars alongside his wife, Emily Blunt. It is the silence of the film that makes me work and you might just consider a silent cinema hall for this one, where the cinematic effects is enough to make you jump off your seats. I\u2019m a tense and original thriller with the story of a family of survivors after an undefined apocalypse. What makes me different from the rest? I\u2019ll definitely have you on the edge of your seat the whole time with your jaw hanging from the suspense. I smartly implement one of the fundamental rules of the horror genre\u200a\u2014\u200athe fear of the unknown. My sound design plays a crucial role in creating a heightened sense of dread and tension throughout. The innovative use of silence no wonder, makes me different from the rest.

            "answer_text": "A few movies immediately come to mind, but I\u2019ll spare you the super long, boring answer and instead go with a top five based on what I remember, what I\u2019ve watched within the last few weeks, and the plot. (It\u2019s still kind of long, but comparatively shorter than what it could have been.) Don\u2019t worry too much though, I\u2019ll avoid spoilers, and it should be interesting. Just because this is a list of horror movies doesn\u2019t mean that I have to be horrible. (A terrible attempt at a joke.)  Make sure to get parent or guardian permission before watching any of the particularly inappropriate ones. Basically, just ask first.  Anyway, we\u2019ll start off at number five. 5) The Blair Witch Project:  This movie is rated R, so just watch out for that\u2026 If I remember correctly there are quite a few inappropriate scenes. When video footage is found, it tells the tale of three film students who had traveled to a small town to collect documentary footage about the Blair Witch- a legendary local murderer. Over the course of several days, the students interview some of the townspeople and gather clues to support the tale's veracity. But the project takes a frightening turn when the students lose their way in the woods and begin hearing horrific noises. It\u2019s more of a psychological thriller, but it\u2019s in my horror movie style of choice. 4) Halloween:  This first installment of the series is from 1978, its rated R, but in the 70s the standards for movies were a lot lower. Let\u2019s just say you\u2019ve been warned. So, on a cold Halloween night in 1963, six year old Michael Myers murders his 17-year-old sister, Judith. He was sentenced and locked away for 15 years. But on October 30, 1978, while being transferred for a court date, a 21-year-old Michael Myers steals a car and escapes Smith's Grove. He returns to his quiet hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, where he looks for his next victims. It\u2019s a pretty crazy movie, with an even crazier protagonist. 3) Jaws:  Jaws is such a classic horror movie, it\u2019s rated PG, and with the less than believable special effects, it\u2019s no wonder why it\u2019s only PG. When a young woman is killed by a shark while skinny-dipping near the New England tourist town of Amity Island, police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches, but mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the loss of tourist revenue will cripple the town. Ichthyologist Matt Hooper and grizzled ship captain Quint offer to help Brody capture the killer beast, and the trio engage in an epic battle of man vs. nature. I think I\u2019ve watched it at least four times, but it\u2019s just so good. It also happens to be one of three movies always playing at night. 2) Eye for an Eye:  Another psychological thriller, this is another movie that is rated R, the first thirty minutes are pretty bad, and then there\u2019s a few scenes in the middle that have a few inappropriate bits\u2026 A busy working mom Karen McCann is stuck in traffic, talking on the phone to her teenage daughter at home, when she hears an intruder break into the house and murder her child. Although the killer is arrested, a legal technicality leads to his release. Despite the best efforts of her patient husband, a sympathetic police detective, and a victims'-rights counselor, Karen becomes obsessed with taking revenge. The actors in this were incredibly believable. It was really crazy, by the end of it I was thoroughly scared of the antagonist. 1) Sleeping With the Enemy:  This is my number one movie, it\u2019s a psychological thriller and I couldn\u2019t possibly think of a horror movie that I liked more than this one. It\u2019s rated R, but the only scenes were about ten minutes in, and then it was pretty much fine. After faking her death in order to flee from her violent husband, Martin, Laura Burney leaves Cape Cod and moves to Iowa, where she adopts a new identity and starts dating a local teacher, Ben Woodward. Martin, meanwhile, unearths evidence suggesting that she isn't dead, and when her mother confirms this, he tracks her to Iowa. He finds Laura and Ben and confronts them, forcing her to fight for her life once again.  I really suggest that you watch the last one, I promise that you won\u2019t be disappointed. All of these movies though are pretty good, these five movies made me like horror movies. Without these five, I would never have gotten into the genre, starting with Jaws almost five years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Even though some of these movies are old \u2026 they do not fall short in the 'effects' department and not movies that you would be disappointed with\u2026 ALL THE ONES BELOW HAVE A HIGH RATING ON IMDB\u2026 So the great ones are: The Conjuring (2013)  Yes this one will scare even the hardened prison inmate \u2026 this was scary, gripping and never a dull moment\u2026 great movie The Poltergeist (1982) I would never believe you if you told me you never pissed yourself after watching this\u2026 excellent movie\u2026 one of the best horror movies ever :) Alien (1979) Watched this I think when I was maybe 8\u2026 loved it then and love it now\u2026 This movie is simply timeless\u2026 Sigourney Weaver is my favourite female actress ever mainly due to her supreme level of confidence, presence and alpha characteristics\u2026 she is simply the epitome of a badass semi-bitch (still nice yet not to be fucked with if you one ugly ass alien). This movie is really for a \u2018mature thinking and appreciative of character development audience\u2019\u2026 who can value the intelligent build up as there is little to no action for say the first 30 mins or so then the tension builds to keep you on the edge of your seat\u2026 it really does get exciting when the Alien is on the prowl whilst the team are loosely scattered onboard a state of the art ship\u2026 oh and I love cats\u2026 this movie has one really nice fluffy one\u2026. its ginger and mega cute \u2026 look out for it :) Aliens (1986) Ok so the Aliens movies are really sci-fi horror, but they are genuinely scary and certainly gripping. This sequel is in my opinion superior to the original with much better action scenes and some scenes are simply unforgettable due to their level of unexpectedness. The casting was perfect as you have a great mix of characters, Bill Paxton, The Mexican looking Bad Ass girl and Michael Beihn, all stand out. Off course Sigourney simply steals the show with another standout performance. The movie has a gradual build up with no real action / horror for quite some time, yet its definitely worth the wait and the beginning part of the movie is still interesting with character build ups so you get some idea of who may survive. Sigourney Weaver simply smashes it with her stern, decisive, intelligent, shrewd and cannot be fooled or fucked with strong persona. Superb actress and one of the finest. She demonstrates her mothering nature in this one and you really build a good bond with her character. So you will enjoy it big time when she destroys the ugly yet intelligent Aliens! This movie is a masterpiece and a solid 10/10. A Nighmare On Elm Street (1984) Freddie was one nasty muthaphucka! \u2026 man he was gruesome, evil and killed the characters you knew were gonna get it but you liked so much you wished they lived\u2026 damn it Freddie\u2026 If I see you in another temporary \u2018realm\u2019 for one day I\u2019m gonna kick your ugly ass better than the Karate guy in the changing room you took out in one of the later movies\u2026 you ass-hole Yes this movie has some classic scenes and if you never watched it, you won\u2019t be disappointed. Final word = CLASSIC The Thing (1982) I watched this only recently. Do not be fooled by this being 1982, thinking the effects will be crap, no! This movie\u2019s strength is the tense thriller based ride it takes you on as you don\u2019t know who is the THING\u2026 an interesting battle of wits in this movie between characters who want to survive yet don\u2019t know who to trust. This movie starts off decent, I give it an 8/10 for the first 30 or so minutes yet by the end of the movie it gets a firm 10/10 for me\u2026 Its John Carpenter\u2026 Genius The Evil Dead 1 and 2 (1981 and 1987) Both were cult classics and to this day I rate them as in the category of the greatest ever. I watched them I think when I was about 7 years old and boy did I enjoy them! Flawless in every way. Fairly shorter than usual movies yet intensely gripping and the director (Sam Raimi) guides you to love the main character who eventually turns mildly psycho in spells and shows no fear in taking out some vile Zombies. Both Evil Dead 1 and 2 are equally as good as each other. If you never seen them, you will thank me for my recommendation The Evil Dead (2013) \u2026 remake Must say\u2026 I was truly impressed by the quality of this remake. There was careful thought injected into this to differentiate it from the originals. I shall leave you to observe those details. The reviews on IMDB are ridiculously low. I\u2019m fussy with everything so If I say this movie is great\u2026 you best believe\u2026 gripping from start to finish and whilst it has no Bruce Campbell, the actors are good enough, the horror action scenes are far from boring. This movie deserves respect. The Exorcist (1973) Cannot remember much of this movie yet I do remember the Priest having a \u2018tough\u2019 time aiming to dispel the demon from the victim ie the girl. I remember this movie having a slow build up with eventually petrifying scenes and so it\u2019s not a non-stop action based horror. I remember enjoying this though as a kid, perhaps I shall watch it again at some point. A few more that are good, just not on the same level as the ones above: Dog Soldiers (2002)An American Werewolf in London (1981)The Thing (2011 - worthy remake contrary to unnecessary criticism)The Conjuring 2 (2016)The Descent (2005)Cube (1997) (Worth a view just for its novelty / originality)Scream (1996) -There might be a few more I have forgotten about\u2026 there are some I have yet to watch. Enjoy :) Bhavin ",

            "answer_text": "Alien (1979)  This blockbuster classic is the best horror film because\u2026 \u2022 It has the greatest female heroine of all time. \u2022 The cast is perfect and everyone plays their part perfectly.  \u2022 The way the characters interact with each other is perfect. There is no pointless romantic relationship that most films are ruined with. The characters are realistic and that makes their deaths more impactful. It's especially good when it comes to Brett and Parker. They are the mechanics and the lowest ranking men on the ship and at the beginning of the movie they are complaining about their salary, joking around with each other and fooling around, they and the other crew are just doing their jobs but as the story progresses you can see their emotions change. This is a simple thing but things like that are what makes this film realistic and more emotional when they die. \u2022 It has the greatest movie monster of all time. It's like Jaws, they don't show the creature much which causes it to be even more ominous and scary. \u2022 One of the best and most unexpected jumpscares in movie history with Dallas in the vents.  \u2022 It has one of the best movie movie designes I've ever seen. The nostormo is so realistic. It's worn out, dirty, and dark\u2026 it's not your typical sci-fi space ship that's spotless and pretty. It's realistic look and dark corridors are the best horror setting ever.  \u2022 It has some of the most shocking and iconic reveals in cinema like the chestburster and Ash being an Android. \u2022 It gives the audience big questions and mysteries like the space jockey and the xenomorphs origins and why they were on the space jockey\u2019s ship. \u2022 It has one of the best endings I've ever seen. After the chaos and suspense of the film the Alien is blown out the airlock and Ripley goes back into hypersleep then the credits roll with a relaxing and emotional end credits song. It's an ambiguous ending. The audience doesn't know if Ripley will be lost in space forever or if she is found\u2026 in 1986\u2019s Aliens (which is a near equally great film) you find out what happens to Ripley. I can't find anything wrong with this film. I feel it's one of those rare films that are essentially perfect. It's also my favorite film I've seen. ",

            "answer_text": "Shadow Company-A film about zombie special ops troops that was to be directed by John Carpenter, and written by Monster Squad co-writers Shane Black and Fred Dekker. Carnivore-Wachowskis\u2019 abandoned project about a cannibalistic soup kitchen. Night Skies-A sci-fi thriller Steven Spielberg was going to make, but he wound up doing E.T. instead. However, some ideas from it wound up in both E.T., and another Spielberg production, Poltergeist. Kaleidoscope-A project Alfred Hitchcock was interested in during the 60s, if this had been made, you\u2019d have had one seriously hardcore horror flick for the period, going way beyond anything anyone would dare attempt until well into the next decade. Hitchcock was bummed out he wasn\u2019t able to make it, but did include elements in Frenzy (which, while itself far more graphic than anything he\u2019d done, was very watered down in comparison to what he had in mind). Geek Love-Tim Burton had wanted to make an adaptation of this, but in the style of Nightmare Before Christmas. Bubba Nosferatu and the Curse of the She-Vampires-A kinda prequel-sequel to Bubba Ho-Tep that was not to be. Paul Giamatti had wanted to get involved, and was keen to play Colonel Tom Parker. Ridley Scott\u2019s I Am Legend-Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. This was going to come out during Arnie\u2019s T2 & True Lies period, intended to be an R-rated epic. It didn\u2019t happen. It - directed by Cary Fukanaga-This director had wanted to make a much darker take on Stephen King\u2019s book than the final results from Andy Muschietti. Ridley Scott\u2019s The Train-This was kinda going to be like Horror Express, transferred to a Blade Runner-esque future, with a more Alien-style approach. With H R Giger on board for design. Diamond Dead-A zombie rock musical by George A Romero that never happened. At the Mountains of Madness-Guillermo del Toro had wanted to make an adaptation of the classic H P Lovecraft tale, likely we\u2019d have seen a bizarre cross between Pan\u2019s Labyrinth and The Thing. James Cameron wanted to produce, Tom Cruise was interested in starring. Freddy vs Jason vs Ash-The Evil Dead hero would take on both minions, with Freddy gaining possession of the Necronomicon for his own evil ends. Halloween: Michael Myers vs Pinhead-Another crossover that was looked at but never happened. Inferno-The director of Les Diaboliques had planned to make a horror-thriller that would be something of a modern take on Dante\u2019s Inferno. Resident Evil, directed by George A Romero-Romero had planned on making it a wee bit more like the game, with a little more focus on the zombies. It was not to be\u2026 An alternate Alien 3-Hicks and Newt found themselves forced to battle aliens, while Ripley was comatose. They would discover these ones could infect people and transform them into xenomorphs (a similar concept briefly appears in Prometheus). Another alternate Alien 3-This was going to do what Halloween and Terminator had done, and give the series a semi-reboot, ignoring everything that came after Aliens, and having Ripley come back to fight aliens once again. 28 Months Later-Would have followed on from the cliffhanger ending of 28 Weeks Later, showing Paris over-run by Rage-afflicted denizens. Battle Royale - the US remake-Not something like The Hunger Games, there was going to be a US version that wouldn\u2019t shy away from the dark tone, but too many school shootings ended that idea. Black the Ripper-Yes. A 70s blaxploitation take on Jack the Ripper. We were denied a potential guilty pleasure. The Golem-The creature of Jewish myth running rampant and murdering people, and only Charles Bronson can stop him! But I guess Cannon favoured more Death Wish films. Dr Phibes sequels-various ideas bandied about to make more sequels to this two-part series, but never came to fruition. Berserker-The director of Re-Animator, Stuart Gordon, and Arnold Schwarzenegger had been interested in making a film about a bodybuilder who would turn into a mutant. ",

            "answer_text": "Before answering the question I must say I am surprised. Hardly any of the answers mention non-American movies. I saw someone saying Martyrs and there was honorable mention of ring (though I am pretty sure it is hollywood remake that is listed and not the original one which is obviously superior). Apart from that it was all Hollywood movies. So I have taken extra care and shuffled through my memory to list World's 10 greatest horror movies. I rank horror movies for greatness by many points. Obviously the movie should have its scare moments which should deprive you of sleep. But it is not all about scare. e.g. A movie like Grotesque (Japan) which is all about scaring you by slashing body parts, start to end. A horror movie should burn you crisp but slowly. It is all about being splendidly bizarre and at the same time quite logical. It is difficult task as there are so many choices to choose from. So obviously this list contains movies which I have watched. Secondly this list is entirely compiled by me and so this is my top 10 and everyone has a right to differ.So let's begin -I will start from no. 10 and finish with my choice for greatest movie i.e. no. 1 The format will be Movie Name, Year, Country and a short descriptionSo coming up no. 10 10) The Exorcist - 1973, USA  Not an obvious No. 10 perhaps. But that defines how high the standards are worldwide. Exorcist is a damn good horror movie, no doubt. But not the greatest of all time. It finds a place at 10 because of some genuinely scary scenes, gripping story line and for changing the way horror movies were made in Hollywood. I would also like to mention Halloween series as being the first slasher franchise but it pales in comparison to Exorcist. 9) Shake,Rattle and Roll - 1984-2012, Philippines  This series gets a special mention solely because it is the longest lasted anthology franchise. Anthology is not a new concept to horror movies but anthology franchise is sure rare. There are a whopping 14 movies in the series and many of the 42 stories can get individual mentions. With 15th in line this list will keep going bigger. My favorite is manananggal from the first movie. 8)Martyrs - 2008, France  In case you are a novice horror fan. There was something called as New French Extremity Movement. This led to french movies which were more bizarre and extreme than ever and someone correctly pointed out were also torture porn. Martys is without doubt finest of them all. It is amazingly awesome and I absolutely loved it. 7) Audition - 1999, Japan  Japan is known for making some of the finest horror movies of all time. In fact there should be a separate list for Japanese horror movies. Audition certainly is the cruelest torture horror possible. It is so sadistic that at 2000 Rotterdam Festival one enraged female viewer confronted director Takashi Mike saying 'you are evil'. This is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of movie. ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WEAK HEARTED ONES!! 6) Alone - 2007, Thailand  Alone is certainly one of the best mainstream horror you can ever get. It has one of the most cliched plots - ghost back for revenge, love triangle and what not. Still, I repeat still, Alone emerges as one of the best horror movie ever made on sheer numbers. It has so many scary moments that I forgot the count. Add to that one of the best plot twist in the climax. Directors, Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom know their strengths very well and oh man this movie is just awesome.  5) REC - 2007, Spain  REC in my opinion is the finest found footage film I have seen. Add to that zombie element and you get in my opinion best Spanish horror film. REC is absolutely mind-boggling. There is not even a single frame a true horror fan would like to miss. REC has tough competition on the way as there are many good found footage films available. They get mentions - Noroi the curse (Japan, 2005) and of course paranormal activity - but for the rank 5 REC wins hands down.P.S. Don't really bother for its sequels REC 2 and REC 3. They provide answers to questions posed by first film but are nowhere near the first film. 4) Suicide Club aka Suicide Circle - 2002, Japan  Sion Sono is one of my favorite directors. This film is his magnum opus without doubt. This film is so bizarre that even the Sequel Noriko's DInner Table doesn't fully explain the plot. This movie is at No. 4 solely because it lacks a satisfactory ending. Otherwise it could be even up and it is damn brilliant. It's opening sequence where 54 teenage schoolgirls commit suicide is a landmark. Best opening scene ever in any kind of movie. Also special note - use of songs. The songs in between simply add to the scare. Best of the lot - the bowling alley scene  3) Shutter - 2004, Thailand   This makes Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom the only ones to have 2 films on the list. Now this is slightly due to personal bias. Nonetheless Shutter deserves to be on this list - again due to sheer no. of scare moments. Compared to Alone the story is better, has the characteristic twisted ending and paved the way for good Thai Horrors for the next decade. 2) A tale of two sisters - 2003, South Korea  This movie is my all time favorite. If only the scare moments were little more I would've ranked this as the greatest without second thought. But this is different kind of horror. This is a slow burner who plays with your emotions. It is known for its twisted characters and slow pace. Many have criticized it for that but it is essential to generate its awesome plot. It is a horror movie with high cinematic values. As a movie it stands head and shoulders above rest 9 in the list. Without doubt the best Korean Horror movie. And the No. 1 is 1) Ju-on - 2000, Japan (better known as Ju-on: The Curse)  No idea right what this is about. Heard of THE GRUDGE? Ju-on is a well known franchise lasting from 1998-2009 and consisting of 6 films of which the 4th and 5th films were remade as The Grudge and The Grudge 2. Now my favorite of the 6 is the 2nd movie as listed above. I was stunned to see how simplified and yet so complexly woven a film can be. Takashi Shimizu made the first film 'Katasumi and 4444444444' as a trial project. After some positive responses and encouragement from his mentor Kiyoshi Kurosawa he came up with this - a direct to video release. It became so successful that it made way for next film and formation of franchise. Kurosawa himself has made good horrors like 'The Cure' but when we are talking of top 10 his disciple beats him. Ju-on is the scariest horror film franchise. No one comes even close to it - not Ring, not Exorcist, not Halloween, not Saw, not Texas Chainsaw Massacre and you can fill the list with any other popular horror film. It simply is the best. So these are my top 10 greatest horror movies. I have purposefully not given plot elements of the movies so you will go and watch them without any expectations. Trust me pick any of these 10 and you will never regret it ",

            "answer_text": "I always answer questions like this by prefacing them with the observation that such questions are fun.  Just fun.  No list of best this or that should be considered definitive.  I've always thought of them as good conversation starters.  Psycho (1960) directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  This diabolical film is a textbook on misdirection.  It takes audience anticipation and thwarts it again and again.  No other film manipulates the viewer with quite this much finesse.  Truly brilliant.  The Haunting (1963) directed by Robert Wise.  The best film ever made involving ghosts.  It's all about what you don't see.  Beautifully shot and edited and helmed by a master filmmaker.  Avoid the 1999 remake.  The Exorcist (1973) directed by William Friedkin.  This baby is genuinely disturbing.  For me, Ellen Burstyn, as the mother of a possessed child, sells this film.  Her reaction to extraordinary circumstances is so believable that you're just sucked in.  It's one of the best performances in horror film history.  Alien (1979) directed by Ridley Scott.  Yeah, it's a man-in-a-rubber-suit monster movie.  But what a suit!  Alien indeed.  H.R. Giger deserves a lot of credit for creating the visual imagery that dominates this film.  Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) directed by Don Siegal.  \"My mother's not my mother.\"  What a premise!  Though the film can be seen as a Cold War allegorical comment on Soviet communism or a stab at McCarthyism, it transcends such characterizations by being so damned creepy.  The '78 remake is pretty good too.  Halloween (1978) directed by John Carpenter.  This film unfortunately gets lumped in with all the other works in the 'Slasher Film' genre.  It's much better than that.  Very well crafted with excellent use of negative space, it seems there's somewhere in just about every shot from which a threat could erupt.  A nice rollercoaster ride of a horror movie.  Frankenstein (1931) directed by James Whale.  It's been said that The Bride of Frankenstein is a better film, and I get that, but this is the one that brought us one of the most iconic monsters in cinema history.  Jack Pierce devised the makeup here and  boy, did he come up with aces!  Boris Karloff is outstanding as the wretched creature.  He's able to horrify us while simultaneously playing on our sympathies.  The Sixth Sense (1999) directed by M. Night Shyamalan.  I admit that this film is a one trick pony, but it's quite a trick.  It plays well on second viewing wherein you can clearly see the hints leading up to the big twist.  Mr. Shyamalan's work since has been disappointing, to say the least, but he nailed it here.  Let the Right One In (2008) directed by Tomas Alfredson.  I've never found vampires very scary, but there's something profoundly creepy about a flesh-rendering beast housed in the body of a cute young girl.  Compounding this dislocating concept is the fact that you kinda like her even though she does terrible things.  The Blair Witch Project (1999) directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick.  I know, I know, the whole 'Found Footage' thing has been done to death.  But it's not this film's fault that its neat little premise has been copied so much.  When it came out it seemed so fresh, so ingenious in its simplicity and it was profoundly 'unHollywood'.  This film creeps you out without actually showing you a single image of real bodily harm.  You either get it or you don't.  I got it. ",

            "answer_text": "You will have to remember that it\u2019s all relative, depending on the preferences of the moviegoer. My very favourite ever Aliens (1986)- Directed by James Cameron  Many would put this into the sci-fi genre, with horror elements. For me, this was horror at highest level. Seeing those strangely elegant and deadly aliens uncoil and attack the marines gave me nightmares for a long time. This sci-fi horror was great because of Ripley, sure, but Newt, the little girl, added an extra layer- and their bonding was such a contrast from the general horror fare. The marines were well fleshed out. You felt for Ripley every time she lost part of her crew. And we also met The Alien Queen.  The Alien Queen herself.  Ripley confronting the Alien Queen  ***By subgenre, here are some of my favourite horror movies: ExtraterrestrialAlien (1977)- The Godfather of all Xenomorph movies. Claustrophobic, dark, suspenseful and a fantastic 'haunted house in space' story. Classic and successful franchise- Alien, Aliens, Alien3, Alien Resurrection. Prometheus(2012) is considered a prequel. The Thing (1982) - A group of American research scientists are disturbed at their base camp by a helicopter shooting at a sled dog. When they take in the dog, it brutally attacks both human beings and canines in the camp and they discover that the beast can assume the shape of its victims. Who is human and who is an alien? The ultimate paranoia experience.  Invasion Of The Body Snatchers (1956) - Another paranoia movie, who is human and who is one of them? Fire In The Sky (1993)- An American biopic science fiction mystery film based on an alleged extraterrestrial encounter. The abduction scenes are the most horrific I've ever seen.  The found footage (hand-held camera) psychological horrorThe Blair Witch Project (1999) -Three film students vanish after traveling into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the local Blair Witch legend, leaving only their footage behind. It spawned countless imitations and spoofs.  Cloverfield (2008)-A group of New Yorkers enjoy a going-away party, not knowing that they will soon face the most terrifying night of their lives. A creature the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Paranormal Activity (2007)-After moving into a suburban home, a young couple becomes increasingly disturbed by what appears to be a supernatural presence.. Very successful franchise.  MonstersThe Descent (2005) - An all female cast go spelunking and discover cannibalistic mutated beings- claustrophobic and scary as hell.  The Fly (1986)- Disturbing for the scenes where a brilliant but eccentric scientist begins to transform into a giant man/fly hybrid after one of his experiments goes horribly wrong.. A classic. A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984)- Wes Craven\u2019s classic slasher. The part monster, part supernatural Freddy Krueger will haunt your dreams after watching the movie The Mist (2007)- A freak storm unleashes a species of blood-thirsty creatures on a small town, where a small band of citizens hole up in a supermarket and fight for their lives. Fantastic and underrated creature feature, quite a few jump scares  Vampire hunger30 Days of Night (2007)-In the far Northern Hemisphere, the small town of Barrow, Alaska, experiences a month of darkness every year. Most of the residents head south for the winter whilst some stay behind. Those that stay regret their decision when, one year, hungry vampires descend on Barrow.  Blade (1998) He's half-man, half-vampire, and he protects the human race from the undead who roam the night. Let the Right One In (2008)- Swedish horror-drama that reinvigorated the vampire genre. Oskar, an overlooked and bullied boy, finds love and revenge through Eli, a beautiful but peculiar girl. All is not what it seems, as Oskar will soon discover.  I Am Legend (2007) An adaptation of the classic sci-fi horror novel by Richard Matheson, the film stars Will Smith as the last man on Earth. The rest of humanity has succumbed to a plague that turns them into night-hunting, blood-sucking monsters. Immortality (1998) -He's just a vampire looking to find the right woman\u2013but what he does with that woman is the stuff of nightmares. Nosferatu (1922)- Vampire Count Orlok expresses interest in a new residence and the real estate agent Hutter's wife. A highly influential silent horror film.

            "answer_text": "10. Let Me In -- A coming of age that is unexpectedly and disorientingly sweet even while something terrifying and/or bloody is happening. Yes, it's very similar to the first film adaptation of the same novel, but that doesn't really matter when the final result is this good. The lovely visual palette and lazy sweeping camera movement creates a dreamy -- sometimes nightmarish -- impression when combined with the patient pacing and terrific cast who speak volumes in the silence between their words. Releasing in October of 2010, this one took only $24 million in theaters, off of a $20 million budget. Sadly, then, it never enjoyed the attention it deserved from audiences. 9. The Woman in Black -- A lush Gothic haunted mansion story in the best classic tradition. Hammer Films had their finest revival entry by far with this gorgeously designed, atmospheric tale. Few horror films have this level of commitment to setup and presence, allowing the tension and dread to grow as we linger in each scene and location. This is one of two films on the list that harken back to good old fashioned haunted house filmmaking of the 1960s and 1970s. Budgeted at a modest $15 million, the $127 million worldwide box office was an impressive return and led to a far less impressive sequel. 8. Troll Hunter -- \"Troll!!\" Satirical without being a comedy, filled with terrific visual effects despite a low budget, and just flat-out wildly entertaining. It's a big-monster movie with enough creepiness and carnage to qualify as \"horror\" for this list, but it's also got terrific mythology and fantasy elements as well, and the fake documentary angle that is otherwise so overused in the genre never wears out its welcome here. The $5 million it managed from global receipts is not much above its $3.5 million budget, but it built a minor cult following on home release, and now a U.S. remake is planned. 7. The Cabin in the Woods -- Among my personal favorite modern horror films, this film includes samplings of just about every sort of horror filmmaking you can image. If the previous entry added some bloody good gore to this list, then get out your mop for this one, because once the monsters get started, they never let up. It's as hilarious as it is gory, as gory as it is fun, and somehow it manages to be one big homage and yet also entirely original all at the same time. The film more than doubled its $30 million budget with $66 million in theatrical revenue, but the studio's portion barely covered those expenses and the marketing adds tens of millions more in the red column. 6. Oculus -- Complex occult terror that devilishly throws us off balance in parallel stories past and present. Constantly forcing viewers to question and second-guess their expectations and perceptions, it delivers gory goods for those who think the rest of the list isn't quite bloody enough. But it's far more than that, and you'll appreciate the smart storytelling and effective acting. The $44 million box office numbers are a win, in light of the comparatively low $5 million budget, another entry that proves low-to-modest budgeting is typically the smartest and most profitable route for horror. 5. It Follows -- Whether perceived as a parable on the dangers of unprotected sex in the age of AIDS and pandemics, or a proclamation of reclaiming control of life and sexuality amid those sorts of dangers, or even as more about broader concepts of simultaneous risks of intimacy and isolation in the modern hyper-connected world, it's undeniably great filmmaking. The relentlessness, personal nature of the central conflict makes it most of all a story simply about death's inevitability however hard we fight to delay or deny it, and that is ultimately why it resonated so strongly with audiences. That, and it's scary as hell. Costing just $2 million to produce, this movie more than covered expenses even with an extremely modest $18 million theatrical cume. 4. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night -- Sensual shades of black and gray mingle to a hip western score for a vampire romance by way of Dead Man and Rumble Fish. Few directors in horror have a freshman outing as perfect as this, and it's brilliant that the blood letting is of secondary importance to the main characters and arcs woven throughout the film. With a micro-budget, the film had a limited release and only took just under $500,000. But it received almost universal critical praise, as well it should, and is building quite a following on home entertainment among horror fans. 3. The Conjuring -- Supposedly based on a true story (but of course, none of it is seriously true), it's old-school haunted house cinema extraordinaire. There is an instant timelessness to the proceedings, and a visual texture that is John R. Leonetti's career-best. If you want to ensure you'll spend the rest of the night awake under your covers, jumping at every creaking floorboard and afraid to look at the closet door lest it seem to move, this is your ticket. At $20 million to produce, the film was a major hit with $318 million worldwide, making it one of the most profitable and highest-grossing horror films in history. 2. The Babadook -- With serious capacity to disturb viewers, it relies not just on monstrous terror but also psychological terror of the most frightening sort. Some of the most unnerving and chilling moments are not of the creepy creature, but of the little boy as he seems to lose his mind or lashes out until his mother is losing hers. Amazingly effective with very few literal \"traditional\" scares, it relies on tension and unsettling real-life moments to make the darker parts all the more horrific. Budgeted at a low $2 million, the film pulled nearly $7 million in theaters and garnered widespread acclaim as one of the greatest modern horror releases. 1. Sinister -- This film has been on my top horror lists since its release, and it's slowly made its way higher with each viewing. Now, it finally sits where it was destined to, as the most terrifying, disturbing, well-acted, perfectly paced horror film not just of the last five years but of the last decade. It's a true modern classic that joins the ranks of The Exorcist, Halloween, Psycho, and other iconic productions that constitute the best achievements of the genre. For the ultimate effect, watch this one as late at night as possible, with all of the lights off and either alone or with just a small number of other people. This film grossed $77 million off of a $3 million budget, so it performed very well and had terrific profit margins. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all I want to thank the readers for giving me 14.5k + views and many upvotes on my previous answer in this Topic. This question is very complicated because One person can find different movie Scary. Different people have different choices.Many previous Commentators said to me - Why don't you use the Recommendations given by IMDb? I want to tell them that I do not prefer IMDb or any other website for my choices. I make my own preference and Luckily, readers are loving it. I will try to use more of that movies which are very frightening and less-mentioned by previous writers. So, Here comes 10 Horror movies from my list (not in any order)~ CURSE OF CHUCKY The continuation of its prequel is spooky enough to leave anyone with a spine chill. The Serial Killer Charles Lee Ray is fully commited for Slaughtering people for their sins.  CONTRACTED Samantha is drugged and raped by a Stranger at a party. The next day, she started developing some wierd symptoms. Samantha struggles to cover up the increasing obvious signs of Sexual Assault and the whole body Horror grosses the Audience! (Aggh!) (NOT YOUR AVERAGE ONE NIGHT STAND)  DARK TOUCH Niamh (Missy Keating) plays the role of a young girl whose parents and siblings has been killed because the Furniture of house turned against them. Clearly, the furniture turned against them because Niamh is a troubled Girl who can move things by her mind. Everything is happening subconsciously and the little girl is completely unaware of it...  LORDS OF SALEM Paying homage to quintessential classic horror, this movie by Rob Zombie is almost like Rob Zombie's interpretation of Rosemary's Baby. The recovering Drug Addict Heidi become possessed by a Witch's Chant and that makes the movie horrifying!  STITCHES There isn't any Clown movie better than this one. Acheiving a perfect blend of Gruesome and funny can be a tough task but Conor McMahon perfected the art. Stitches (Ross Noble), a reanimated Clown seeking revenge on the Kids. After being accidentally offended at a Child's birthday party, he shouts Menace. ( The scene where he makes balloon animals with Intestines, still terrifies me enough! )  MANIAC When the movie was first released back in 1980 it gave birth to lot of controversies due to its Extreme Violence and Subject Matter. Frank Zito, a Psychopath scalps woman to dress up his mannequins. Wood is so strong that his deeply twisted role does Murders so brutally that the overall experience becomes unbearable and Worth watching at a same time.  EVIL DEAD A remake as horrifying as this one could'nt be possible if it was done by anyone except Fede Alvarez. Jane Levy has done a outstanding performance by acting both Mia and Final Girl, culminating in a gloriously bloody confrontation. (This movie is famous for its Disgusting scenes.)  YOU'RE NEXT This Home Invasion Thriller will leave you much more than mere Goosebumps. Erin has proved herself to be the best Final Girls in recent Memory.

The sixth sense  \u200b\u200bIt is not only best among horror genre, but among the best of all movies. Ending of this movie is awesome.  2. Exorcism of Emily Rose  \u200b\u200bThis movie is based on true story and has right script. It explores both medical as well as religious views of possession.  3. The conjuring  \u200b\u200bThe movie is also based on true story and has excellent way of telling a story.  4. The ring  \u200b\u200bThis one is often rated as best of the horror movies and it is really scary.  5. 1408  \u200b\u200bThis movie has very different story where the hotel room is possessed. This movie makes you more anxious as it progresses.  6. It follows  \u200b\u200bAgain a different story where the possession can be transferred by sexual activity. It is entertaining and scary.  7. The babadook  \u200b\u200bA simple but different story but had scary moments. 8. Drag me to hell  \u200b This movie is usual horror movie with excellent background score and relentless supernatural powers.  If I consider the slasher, zombie or psycho killer movies as horror, I should add following movies also - 1. The Halloween  \u200b\u200bProbably the best pure-slasher movie ever. It is damn scary (for its era).  2. Silence of the lambs  \u200b\u200bThis movie made Hannibal Lecter and man-eater as synonyms. Anthony Hopkins is at his best and really scares you.  3. Martyrs  \u200b\u200bMost violent movie that I have watched. There is so much blood that you would want to puke.  4. Rec  \u200b\u200bA foreign language movie which is shot in documentary style. Language won't be a problem since it is visually very scary.  5. Saw  \u200bThe first movie of this franchise was really really scary. It makes the viewers anxious.  6. 28 days later  \u200bZombie craze at its best. This movie is equally entertaining also. ",

            "answer_text": "Horror is my favorite genre. I have seen so many horror films and these are some of the best ones: The Conjuring  The Conjuring - Wikipedia In 1970, paranormal investigators and demonologists Lorraine and Ed Warren are summoned to the home of Carolyn and Roger Perron. The Perrons and their five daughters have recently moved into a secluded farmhouse, where a supernatural presence has made itself known. Though the manifestations are relatively benign at first, events soon escalate in horrifying fashion, especially after the Warrens discover the house's macabre history.One of the best things about it is that its based on real events. The Babadook  The Babadook - Wikipedia A troubled widow discovers that her son is telling the truth about a monster that entered their home through the pages of a children's book.This film might seem not so good at first glance but the plot and jump scares are worth it. REC  REC (film) - Wikipedia This is a great Spanish movie. A reporter and her cameraman record the horrifying outbreak of a disease that turns humans into vicious cannibals. The twist at the end and the mockumentary style that it used (which may be the best example of \u201cfound footage\u201d till date) is commendable. If anyone here likes found footage type then they should go for this one. The Blair Witch Project  The Blair Witch Project - Wikipedia Found video footage tells the tale of three film students who've traveled to a small town to collect documentary footage about the Blair Witch, a legendary local murderer. Over the course of several days, the students interview townspeople and gather clues to support the tale's veracity. But the project takes a frightening turn when the students lose their way in the woods and begin hearing horrific noises. The Others  The Others (2001 film) - Wikipedia Grace (, the devoutly religious mother of Anne and Nicholas , moves her family to the English coast during World War II. She awaits word on her missing husband while protecting her children from a rare photo sensitivity disease that causes the sun to harm them. Anne claims she sees ghosts, Grace initially thinks the new servants are playing tricks but chilling events and visions make her believe something supernatural has occurred. The twist in the plot is to die for and Nicole Kidman\u2019s acting is amazing. Oculus  Oculus (film) - Wikipedia Haunted by the violent demise of their parents 10 years earlier, adult siblings Kaylie and Tim are now struggling to rebuild their relationship. Kaylie suspects that their antique mirror, known as the Lasser Glass, is behind the tragedy. The seemingly harmless reflections contain a malevolent, supernatural force that infects the mind of anyone who gazes into it. As Kaylie gets closer to the truth, the siblings become caught in the mirror's evil spell. Unfriended  Unfriended - Wikipedia One night, while teenagers Blaire, Mitch, Jess, Adam Ken and Val take part in an online group chat session, they are suddenly joined by a user known only as \"Billie227.\" Thinking it's just a technical glitch, the friends carry on their conversation. Until Blaire begins receiving messages from someone claiming to be Laura Barns, a classmate who killed herself exactly one year prior. As Blaire tries to expose Billie's identity, her friends are forced to confront their darkest secrets and lies. Insidious  Insidious (film) - Wikipedia A family looks to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child in a realm called The Further.This movie is based on astral projections and outer body experiences and has been wonderfully executed.

            "answer_text": "It is difficult to pick the 10 greatest horror films, but here are my top ten based on how much they traumatized me and influence my work in some way: Evil Dead 2  The original was great, but the second time around they stopped taking it so seriously and crafted a brilliant, funny and disturbing flick that delivers in a way none other can. Necronomicon, laughing taxidermy, chainsaw hand...you can't go wrong. Saw  How far would you go to survive? A question most of us will never have the opportunity to answer. Friday the 13th  Sex, death and summer camp. Jason (or his crazy mom) killing camp counselors will never get old. Texas Chainsaw Massacre  Complete unhinged madness. But of course, anything inspired by Ed Gein will always be a personal favorite, as his life and crimes tend to be told like fairy tales here in Wisconsin. IT  Responsible for a lifelong fear of drains, balloons, swamps, clowns, fortune cookies, etc. House  House just might be the ultimate haunted house movie. It is creepy and campy in all the right ways. Beware of closets and medicine cabinets. Critters  They're adorable. Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon  Behind the Mask was a fresh and intelligent take on the traditional slasher. Cube  A complicated maze of interconnected cubes with brutal trap waiting to slice you burn you, or otherwise dismember you is not where you want to wake up. Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight  The cryptkeeper's cinematic debut. Demon Knight was everything great about the Tales from the Crypt series mashed up into one hell of a crazy movie. ",

            "answer_text": "9 Best Horror Movies Ever 1) Host (2020) The movie: We knew it had been on the way, but post-pandemic horror has already arrived within the shape of a Zoom call gone very, very wrong. Desperately on the search for something to try to to aside from endless lockdown quizzes \u2013 we feel this \u2013 a gaggle of friends get together for a web mid-lockdown seance. What follows may be a short, sharp shock of found footage adrenaline in an intimidatingly lean 56 minute run time. Host isn\u2019t the primary horror to require place on a display screen , taking terrifying inspiration from REC, The Blair Witch Project, and Paranormal Activity, yet delivering a dangerously relevant frightmare. Happy spookies. 2) Saw (2004) The movie: it'd have reignited the so-called torture porn genre with its (mostly) truly disgusting sequels but - and this is often an enormous \u2018but\u2019 - the first Saw is nowhere near as gross-gusting as you think that it's and happens to be brilliant horror. Yes, the title is about an implement that a depraved killer suggests someone takes their leg off with instead of use a key to unlock a cuff, but Saw is really remarkably restrained. The ideas at work here are significantly more grisly in your own mind than what you see on screen. Made on a shoestring budget by Leigh Whannell and James Wan, this tale of two men awakening during a bathroom, a corpse between them, is twisted but constantly intriguing. 3) The Birds (1963) The movie: Sure, there\u2019s all that mention showers and murder - Editor\u2019s note: we all know it\u2019s not just \u2018talk\u2019 and Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho may be a genuine horror masterpiece - but it\u2019s time to speak about the feathery elephant within the room. The Birds, the Master of Suspense\u2019s loose adaptation of a brief story of an equivalent name by Daphne du Maurier, is scare cinema at its finest. When Tippi Hedren\u2019s Melanie Daniels heads to Bodega Bay to deliver some love birds, she gets much more than she bargained for when the wild winged inhabitants of the town decide that human eyes might taste even as good as discarded chips. Why it\u2019s scary: very similar to Jaws, The Birds preys on your simplest fears. Open water? Not on behalf of me , thanks. How about the very concept the seemingly innocent feathery ones in your surroundings are literally using those tiny skulls to plot to murder you where you stand? Hard nope. If you haven\u2019t seen it, to travel further would be spoileriffic. Where The Birds excels is in its gradual, lurking fear; its patience and looming dread. Plus, the real panic in Hedren\u2019s eyes as very real birds were thrown in her direction may be a truly terrifying sight to behold. Just stay safe within the knowledge that nobody makes films quite like this anymore. 4)Dawn of the Dead (1978) The movie: Choosing just one undead Romero offering for an inventory of the simplest horror movies of all time may be a bit like taking over the shuffling horde with a letter opener: gory and challenging, but not altogether impossible. After much deliberation then, it\u2019s time to travel shopping. Romero\u2019s gory attack on the consumerist American Dream follows four survivors of the zombie apocalypse as they reach a sprawling mall. While they manage to urge inside empty munching on their brains, it doesn\u2019t take long before the beacon of the mall attracts other guests and therefore the defences start to gorily break down. Why it\u2019s scary: We\u2019ve had more hungry shuffling hordes than we will count since Romero\u2019s initial public offering but that doesn\u2019t make the source material any less horrifying to observe . The gentle concept the zombies are still heading to the mall after death is an insidious one, and therefore the relentless violence of Night\u2019s sequel is an experience that demands your attention. Tom Savini\u2019s delicious practical effects too mean there\u2019s still many squirm for your buck as skin and muscle are ripped from their sticking places. Plus, if you are feeling such as you just can\u2019t watch anything in but HD, Zack Snyder\u2019s 2004 remake may be a surprisingly effective, to not mention creepy, replacement. 5) Shaun of the Dead (2004) The movie: If Scream reignited the thrill of the teenager slasher movie, the return of excellent zombies to our screens is all Simon Pegg and Nick Frost\u2019s fault. the primary in Edgar Wright\u2019s \u2018Cornetto Trilogy,\u2019 Shaun of the Dead follows the titular Shaun as he plods his way through his dreary London existence, only to get (beautifully late) that the bulk of the population has been transformed into shambling cannibals while he was asleep. Suddenly realizing he must be the hero everyone deserves, it\u2019s time to rescue his mum, get his girlfriend back, and confirm most are fine in time for tea. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t quite attend a perfectly edited plan. Why it\u2019s scary: While it slickly plays for laughs, Shaun of the Dead is extremely much a horror at its gory heart. It plays by Romero\u2019s rules with a slow zombie horde which suggests that their staggering relentlessness may be a constant fear, if one tempered by an excellent comic script. And these aren\u2019t just disposable characters made to be pulled to pieces in an explosion of O-negative. Everyone matters here, meaning that each zombie encounter does too. contribute an excellent soundtrack, excellent performances, and more red than you'll throw a bat at, and Shaun of the Dead may be a comedy horror masterpiece. 6) A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) The movie: a bit like a particular dungaree-clad possessed doll, Freddy Krueger fell firmly into killer clown territory because the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise evolved over the years. Sure, he\u2019ll spray your organs everywhere the walls but you\u2019ll die laughing, right? reminisce at Wes Craven\u2019s original movie, though, and Freddy isn\u2019t to be trifled with. Our selective memories mean we frequently forget that this serial child killer\u2019s burns come from him being incinerated by an angry mob of oldsters . Living eternally through their fear and guilt, Freddy becomes the last word boogeyman when he dons his favourite murder glove and goes after an entire new generation of Springwood spawn while they slumber. Why it\u2019s scary: Bed is supposed to be safe. Secure. freed from razor sharp blades able to plunge through your chest at any given moment... Robert Englund\u2019s Freddy could be horrible to seem at but it\u2019s the very idea of falling asleep and never awakening again that\u2019s truth terrifying kicker here. The desperation of Heather Langenkamp\u2019s Nancy and her friends as they strive to remain aware of stay alive. No amount of caffeine or loud music can prevent now, dreams are waiting and that\u2019s where a maniac lurks menacingly within the dark to finish your life. Yes, the entire movie is worthwhile alone for Johnny Depp\u2019s spectacularly splattery death scene alone, but A Nightmare on Elm Street isn\u2019t one to press the snooze button on. 7) Evil Dead 2 The movie: numerous Evil Dead 2 questions, so little time. Is it a remake? Is it a sequel? wouldn't it actually be physically possible to modify out your missing (presumed possessed) hand for a chainsaw with relative ease? Well, thankfully, Bruce Campbell himself has answered the primary two and explained that Sam Raimi\u2019s cabin-based comedy horror is, in fact, a \u2018requel.\u2019 Whereas the first Evil Dead followed a gaggle of twenty somethings to a vacation house from hell, the sequel revolves exclusively around Campbell\u2019s Ash and his girlfriend Linda as they plan to survive after playing a reading of the Necronomicon aloud. I'd be remiss if I didn't warn you about someone being beheaded with a lawn tool post reading. Why it\u2019s scary: Evil Dead 2 is ideal comedy horror. While it'd not send you shrieking faraway from your screen, there\u2019s a delightfully depraved viscerality to proceedings. Eyes in mouths, wall to wall gore, chainsaws feeling just like the only option. It\u2019s worth noting here, too, that if you are doing want something a touch less punctuated with the word \u2018groovy,\u2019 then the Evil Dead remake from Fede Alvarez is actually something which will get under your skin. Where Evil Dead 2\u2019s grim is played for much appreciated laughs and you\u2019ll embrace the physical effects, Alvarez\u2019s reboot errs distinctly on the unnerving side, making them an ideal double bill. 8) The Babadook (2014) The movie: On release, Jennifer Kent\u2019s haunted pop-up book became an entire generation\u2019s boogeyman seemingly overnight. \u201cHave you seen the Babadook? I didn\u2019t sleep all night,\u201d was hissed gleefully across offices and pubs. And permanently reason. The Babadook is horrifying . the story of a young grieving widow trying to seem after her young son, this is often a movie that sneaks under your skin and stays there. It also causes you to ask yourself tons of questions. What would you are doing with a crop up book a few creepy black clad figure during a top hat? Would you read it to your already traumatised young son? What if he begged? and the way would you affect the \u2018haunting\u2019 that follows\u2026? Why it\u2019s scary: just like the best horror movies on this list, the Babadook isn\u2019t almost scaring its audience. The parallels between grief and depression are not any accident and it\u2019s interesting to notice that one among the foremost disturbing sequences within the movie has nothing to try to to with a monster, but everything to try to to with a young mother losing control of her son while she tries to drive. On the surface you would possibly mistake The Babadook for something from The Conjuring universe but delve in and this is often an intelligent, gruelling frightfest with a knowledge of exactly what you\u2019re scared of . albeit you didn\u2019t realize it once you sat right down to watch. 9) The Cabin within the Woods (2011) The movie: By 2011, we were having a self-referential horror crisis. Scream 4 was out and had an intro multiple layers deep, smashing the fourth wall into pieces with horror-ception as character after character quipped about the masked slasher genre. But where could comedy horror go next? what percentage times could a number one actress say \u201cI saw this during a movie once\u201d without us eager to remove our own eyes and never watch horror again? Well, it seems that there was still some life within the reanimated corpse yet. The Cabin within the Woods manages to pin not only one horror trope but every single one, like someone armed with a laser sight and Final Destination 3\u2019s nail gun. When this lot of attractive twenty-somethings head to the titular spot, they get significantly quite they bargained for. Oh, and Chris Hemsworth is one among them. Now you\u2019re interested\u2026 Why it\u2019s scary: Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard\u2019s creation is not any mere comedy escapade. I\u2019m staying spoiler-free here because it\u2019s too good, but a bit like the It movie and its monster\u2019s multiple faces, The Cabin within the Woods will tackle many of your phobias. this is often a creature feature like you\u2019ve never seen before with gallons of gore and each monster you'll ever imagine lurking within the dark. Like Buffy before it, this has the power to form you laugh one minute and scream subsequent. enter blind and this trip to the forest may be a delightfully gory surprise. Source:GamesRadar.com ",

            "answer_text": "The Wailing (2016) Forget about most of the inflated but substandard horror films you been served since long time, there is nothing quite like \u2018The Wailing\u2019. It makes the most loved horror film series in recent times , \u2018The Conjuring\u2019 look like a school project. \u2018The Wailing\u2019 is the best psychological-thriller horror film since William Friedkin\u2019s \u2018The Exorcist (1973)\u2019. And if you don\u2019t follow international film festivals and Korean cinema, probably it is good to register the name \u2018Na Hong-jin\u2019, director & writer of \u2018The Wailing\u2019, who also made more viable and accessible action thriller \u2018The Yellow Sea\u2019 and \u2018The Chaser\u2019. \u2018The Wailing\u2019 is like a gigantic monster whose presence is unknown but his terror-stricken ominous presence of supernatural force is felt by eerie silence around you, like you are just to be gulped by rain of horror. The film is set in the small mountain town of Korea where people are locked in the worst nightmarish conflict of mysterious happening to the village dwellers, rational thinking, and super natural forces. At the center of the conflict is incompetent,sissy Police officer Jong-gu (Kwak Do-won) who is going through mid-life crisis, and having an extra marital affair, and some how he gets entangle in strange random killing rampage. His investigation unleashes the greatest terror in the form of paranoia and satanic cult. Disclosing any further plot would be a crime. Na Hong-jin let the central plot grow organically with the time, while keeping its audiences busy setting the puzzling trap of horror served with the dash of doleful humor. If you had not know nothing about the film, you would probably believe that the film is comedy thriller in its first hour. While Na Hon-jin\u2019s magnificent multi-layered screenplay keeps you busy in collecting the subplot of creepy & strange killing in town, you don\u2019t even realize how he already tricked you in his sinistral and nightmarish plot that will be hard to forget for days, or even months. Na cleverly bends the multiple genre with such panache into satanic cult and ancient folk tale, that it elevates genre transcending of combination of thriller with art house element that evolved decades back in South East Asia. And be warned, never go to your house until you hear three roasters after coming from night-out, never ever. ",

            "answer_text": "Here's my top twelve, why not? (in no particular order): 1. Don't look now. (1973). Nicholas Roeg's brilliantly atmospheric horror masterpiece set in the cold of wintry Venice, starring Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. 2. The Haunting. (1963). Robert Wise directs the ultimate lights out chiller. Avoid the remake though. 3. Dracula - Prince of darkness. (1966). Got to put a Hammer production in here. Directed by Terence Fisher, Hammer's best filmmaker, it's an enjoyable and atmospheric movie. 4. Rosemary's baby. (1968). Genius horror from Roman Polanski. Based on Ira Levin's superb novel it features a top notch performance from Mia Farrow. Not one for pregnant women though. 5. The Omen. (1976). Silly but fun. Still, Gregory Peck's performance holds it together and Jerry Goldsmith's brilliantly unsettling score is the icing on the cake. 6. Dead of night. (1945). Ealing studios, usually a producer of comedies, make this enjoyable horror flick, featuring five different stories with Michael Redgrave's performance in the last segment, a standout. 7. An American werewolf in London. (1981). John Landis brilliantly fuses horror and comedy in this enjoyable movie which features Oscar winning state of the art special effects. 8. The Shining. (1980). Stanley Kubrick directs Jack Nicholson in his version of the Stephen King novel. Here's Johnny! 9. The Excorcist. (1973). This has to be included in any horror top ten. One of the most influential horror movies ever. Great use of Tubular bells too. 10. Invasion of the body snatchers. (1978). Phillip Kaufman directs the best version of Ira Levin's great novel. And Leonard Nimoy's in it too. 11. The Wicker man. (1973). Originally a supporting feature for Don't look now. Now rightfully a classic in it's own right. 12. Night of the demon. (1957). Classic horror starring Dana Andrews, but it's Niall McGinnis who steals the show as black magician Julian Carswell. Absolutely brilliant. ",
