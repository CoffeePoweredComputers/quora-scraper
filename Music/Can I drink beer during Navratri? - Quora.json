            "answer_text": "It's entirely up to you and your belief system. There are some who are staunch followers of religion and believe that only certain groups of food must be consumed on those 9 days. Then there are others who are non-believers and to them it's OK do eat and drink as they please. To each is own. The trouble begins when one begins to impose their belief system on the other. So if want to drink it's your choice. If you're worried that a thunderbolt will strike your head from the sky, you can relax. Nothing of that sort will happen. The worst that'll happen is you will end up offending a few people around you (probably a few close ones too). ",
