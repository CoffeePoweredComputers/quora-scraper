            "answer_text": "Well, Ukulele\u2019s are not a low pitch instrument\u2026 With is being such a small instrument, and the strings being so short, there is only so much you can do to make it go lower in pitch. Baritone ukuleles are only lower because the scale of the guitar is larger, the distance between the nut and bridge is longer so, therefore, the pitch is lower. Similarly, bass guitars, have a longer scale than most stringed instruments so the pitch is naturally lower. The only thing I would recommend you do, has already been mentioned, the tuning of a ukulele is GCEA, with that top G string being one of the highest sounding strings, so you could replace it with a different G string that rings an octave lower which gives your ukulele, (in my opinion) a much nicer overall sounding instrument. You could also, if you have the budget for it, try getting a baritone ukulele, or even a tenor ukulele, which already has a lower tone than say a soprano ukulele. If you don\u2019t already know, there are a few different sizes when it comes to choosing a ukulele. the baritone has one noticeable difference from the rest of the ukuleles though, the tuning is different, it is DGBE, which might seem familiar if you play guitar because it is the same as the last four strings on a guitar.  Any way\u2026 Thank you for reading, and I hope my answer helped! ",

            "answer_text": "Because most ukuleles, especially soprano and concert size instruments, use \u201creentrant\u201d tuning, with the 4th string tuned to high G, just one whole note below the first string, tuned to A. Your lowest string is the third string, tuned to middle C, so you only have one octave range when playing all four strings near the neck, where most beginners and intermediate players learn how to play chords. You can \u201cfix\u201d this in three ways: (1) Change the 4th string to a low G string, usually wound bronze instead of fluorocarbon/ nylon because a nylon low G string would be really thick and hard to play and often requires that you cut a wider V-notch in your nut to accommodate the added thickness. That gives you an extra 1/3 of an octave for your range, and the instrument tone takes on more characteristics of a guitar played at the middle of its neck (5th to 9th frets), without the guitar\u2019s 2 bass strings.  source: Low-G 'Ukulele Strings: Tips on Tuning Linear \u2013 Live Ukulele (2) Learn to play chords up the neck with one or two strings left open where possible. For example, you can play a C chord with an open G string and a \u201cG\u201d chord shape at the 7th and 8th frets on the 1\u20132 strings: 0\u20130\u20138\u20137 or G-C-C-E (I cannot find a good picture of this chord online). Especially with a low G tuning, that gives you a relatively wide tone range for your chord. (3) Get a baritone or bass ukulele. Baritone ukes are tuned to D-G-B-E, same as the top 4 strings of a guitar, with the longer string length of a guitar and a body slightly larger than a tenor size ukulele. This instrument sounds like a small parlor guitar instead of sounding like a ukulele, but you blend in with ukuleles to make a richer sound. A bass ukulele like the Kala U-bass is tuned like a guitar bass - E-A-D-G with really fat rubber band strings; the instrument usually requires a small amp. There are also some small acoustic basses like Taylor\u2019s GS Mini-e Bass that do not require amplification. Remember that your ukulele wasn\u2019t meant to have a broad tone range, rather a happy soprano voice range. With your standard soprano to tenor ukulele, you can move your tonal range higher by playing up the neck (using a 5\u20137\u20138\u20137 phrase for your C chord, which makes a sound more like an electric guitar\u2019s voice) and let others play in first position. That way your group produces a wider range of tones, from middle C (your open C string) to 2 octaves above middle C (15th fret on the 1st string). But you aren\u2019t going lower without adding different instruments. ",
