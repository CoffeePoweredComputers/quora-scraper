            "answer_text": "The best way to get better at rhythm is to listen. Listen to the type of music that you want to play, and listen to it a lot. The more you listen the more you will feel and understand the music, including rhythm. Rhythm is one of those things that you can\u2019t just do, you have to feel it with your body. So sometimes just reading the music is not enough, it takes listening, and doing some other physical action. Try tapping your fingers or your foot to the music. Try tapping the beat, but also try tapping the actual rhythm. Try singing along or saying the rhythm on a ta-ta-ta\u2026 Try tapping along with a metronome. First just tap the beat, then try tapping twice per best like an eight note, or tapping once every two beats. Try this at different tempos. For reading rhythms, learn all the note values, such as quarter notes, half notes, whole notes, eight notes, 16th notes, triplets. Know how many beats each note gets. Then try reading different rhythms, without actual music, just the rhythms. Clap or tap these rhythms with a metronome. Also, learn how to count out loud. To do this you need to know all the note values and how to count each note. Then figure out how many beats are in the measure, for example, 4/4 has 4 beats per measure. And count 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and, and when you get to the barline, start again from 1. Counting out loud can dramatically improve your rhythm. But make sure it is out loud, because when you count in your mind, you will probably stop at any hard spot. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "(Um\u2026rhythm is the first element of music, so you should revise your question). Rhythm is NOT purely innate, nor is accuracy of steady beat. Every person can develop their rhythmic acuity. I\u2019ve taught lots and lots of people to improve individually and in ensemble. Try the following: Tap with fingers the DIVISION of beat (ex. 8th notes in 4/4) on palm of other hand in all your practice.You don\u2019t mention your instrument, but sing every rhythm you have on \u201ctah\u201d as you tap the division of beat. Then, when you can sing the rhythm perfectly, apply it to your instrument.Memorize some of your rhythms; walk/step the beat as you tap the division with fingers on opposite palm. This way, you internalize the \u201cbig beat\u201d in your entire body, with big muscles. Ever notice how certain ethnic groups dance and move in rhythm naturally? This isn\u2019t genetic; it\u2019s the result of everyone in their environment doing this activity really regularly for generations. It\u2019s a natural part of their culture and society, and it\u2019s learned by every child. Western Euro/Americans don\u2019t have this same cultural thing happening as much, so we have to work on it.Check yourself with a metronome regularly, but don\u2019t practice with the metronome. Instead, establish the beat/division of beat in your own being: brain and body.Learn to read rhythms accurately. Here\u2019s a site with examples to practice. https://www.samuelstokesmusic.com/exercises/4-4_Basic_Rhythm_Practice.pdfGet a teacher on your instrument to help you improve your rhythm.YOU CAN DO IT! Beat and rhythm are really pretty easy to improve, if you practice right.",

            "answer_text": "I have to agree with the previous answer and say that in my experience, if it doesn\u2019t come naturally you are going to have a hard time then still trying to make something constructive out of it. That said, everybody has got rhythm, some just have the good looking type which styles into worth watching the person dance or use it to create or follow music. Go to a club and dance with your eyes closed to what you feel to be the rhythm that makes you want to move on it/together with. Once you feel comfortable within yourself, start opening your eyes and see if you can identify the rhythm some of the others are following. Stick to your one, but start to be able to identify and appreciate what is not yours as others should do for you. Slowly you will adapt what you feel syncs with your \u201cown\u201d rhythm and be able to diversify. Just my take on it, hope it might bring you some always welcome new rhythm to that same old songs.

            "answer_text": "(A2A) I think that you need a sense of time, and this is innate: not learned. By that, I mean, can you keep a steady tap and feel it inside your body or head? Over time, you can learn to direct your concentration to recognize when you (or someone else) slows down or speeds up, but if you don\u2019t have a gut-like sense of a beat, and you have to spend a lot of energy just trying to keep up, sorry, rhythm ain\u2019t your thing. But if you have that steady tap, then practice many kinds of rhythms, especially the syncopated ones. Look for Caribbean, Latin, Afro-Cuban music. Maybe listen to a percussion ensemble, like Samba Squad, and imitate their rhythms. Or just get into it.  ",
