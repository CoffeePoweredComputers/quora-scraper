            "answer_text": "I\u2019m surprised no one has mentioned \u201cWish You Were Here\u201d by Pink Floyd! It\u2019s soft, beautiful and utterly heart-breaking. Try Simon & Garfunkel. Most of their hits are wonderful - from \u201cThe Sound Of Silence\u201d to \u201cThe Boxer\u201d or even \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water\u201d, \u201cI Am A Rock\u201d and \u201cMrs. Robinson\u201d. My personal fave is \u201cHomeward Bound\u201d The Eagles had some nice ones, such as \u201cDesperado\u201d. Also the Everly Brothers\u2019 \u201cAll I Have To Do Is Dream\u201d Try folk-rock such as Bob Dylan - fave \u201cMr. Tambourine Man\u201d and Neil Young (Old Man) as well as Joni Mitchell (Both Sides Now) Also November Rain by GNR, Try To Remember by The Brothers Four. And the softest, sweetest ever: Back In Black by AC DC as well as Anarchy In The U.K. by The Sex Pistols ;-) ",
