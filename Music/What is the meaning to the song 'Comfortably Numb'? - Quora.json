            "answer_text": "Well, if you have seen The Wall movie, you will realize that the it's Roger Waters telling his story through Pink. Oh baby, you will always be a baby to me was about his over protective mother who at times would drive him insane, No dark sarcasm in the classroom, teachers leave the kids alone was about the teachers who traumatized Roger when he was in school. Comfortably Numb was also a collection of his childhood memories mixed with his health issues even when he had grown up.  Roger Waters was the one who wrote the lyric for this song. While many people thought the song was about drugs, Waters claims it is not. The lyrics are about what he felt like as a child when he was sick with a fever. As an adult, he got that feeling again sometimes, entering a state of delirium, where he felt detached from reality. He told Mojo magazine (December 2009) that the lines, \"When I was a child I had a fever/My hands felt just like two balloons\" were autobiographical. He explained: \"I remember having the flu or something, an infection with a temperature of 105 and being delirious. It wasn't like the hands looked like balloons, but they looked way too big, frightening. A lot of people think those lines are about masturbation. God knows why.\"In a radio interview around 1980 with Jim Ladd from KLOS in Los Angeles, Waters said part of the song is about the time he got hepatitis but didn't know it. Pink Floyd had to do a show that night in Philadelphia, and the doctor Roger saw gave him a sedative to help the pain, thinking it was a stomach disorder. At the show, Roger's hands were numb \"like two toy balloons.\" He was unable to focus, but also realized the fans didn't care because they were so busy screaming, hence \"comfortably\" numb. He said most of The Wall is about alienation between the audience and band.Exploring further, Mojo asked Waters about the line, \"That'll keep you going through the show,\" referring to getting medicated before going on-stage. He explained: \"That comes from a specific show at the Spectrum in Philadelphia (June 29, 1977). I had stomach cramps so bad that I thought I wasn't able to go on. A doctor backstage gave me a shot of something that I swear to God would have killed a f---ing elephant. I did the whole show hardly able to raise my hand above my knee. He said it was a muscular relaxant. But it rendered me almost insensible. It was so bad that at the end of the show, the audience was baying for more. I couldn't do it. They did the encore about me.\" (thanks, Cody - San Diego, CA) ",

            "answer_text": "This song works on many levels, laying out broad emotions and intriguing details for people to make their own interpretation. Whatever the band was thinking at the time, the song resonated for many in the early 1980s as a recollection of tuning out, losing your dreams, becoming distant. Years before, Roger Waters had written similar lyrics for Time, about a young(ish) man who had \"missed the starting gun\" on life, realizing ten years later that his life hadn't amounted to anything but getting older. Comfortably numb is darker, about retreating into fantasy, closing off from the world after an unexplained trauma or pain, the calm of not caring anymore about the world. People get that the literal story is about an illness, or mental illness, or drug use, the words are fairly obvious in that regard. But why would anybody care about someone else's 35-year-old drug problem (except perhaps to account for those awesome guitar solos)? If you are a fan, perhaps you care which drugs your band is on. But as listeners, those who adopted music as their personal anthems and choice of friends and style of dress, people saw it as a metaphor for their their own condition, the disillusionment that many young, passionate, and creative people, and outcasts, had to the Reagan Era in the US and the very similar Margaret Thatcher years in Great Britain, and the societal changes that accompanied their rise to power. After the idealistic 1960s and indulgent 1970s, and the crushing disappointments of Watergate, Vietnam, AIDS, recessions, people hung up their flower dresses and disco pants for business suits and trudged off to work. Politicians, schools, parents now praised thrift, and productivity, job creation, fighting dangerous ideologies, and social climbing as goals \u2014 not expanding your mind, changing the world, peace, and love. Young people got by in this era by becoming comfortably numb, retreating to an inner world, and enjoying the beauty they found there. The power of the song is the beauty of that distant world. David Gilmour's singing about having a fever, being not being \"who I am\", the outside world only \"coming through in waves\", people's lips moving without hearing what they are saying, sounds like a very nice world. Unlike the rough anger of punk, another reaction, that guitar solo is not numb at all, no quiet desperation here, it is a seductive, passionate place. ",
