            "answer_text": "Not if you\u2019re looking to do multi-track recording directly on it. It\u2019s great for programmed music much but hopeless for recording actual musicians unless you use a separate analogue pre-amp mixer so the musicians aren\u2019t playing on a delay (you would then just have to work out how much to offset your tracks by to put them back in time). Your musicians also need to bring their amps rather than being able to use built in amp simulators and effects. Or you need to buy amps for everything you want to play. You don\u2019t get the option of just plugging straight into the desk. That\u2019s an added expense and increased hassle. If you want decent performance out of it then a PC is not the cheapest option. I have to say I am yet to see a PC which can cope with multitrack recording. Latency latency latency. Avoid PCs like the plague unless you\u2019re really good at playing 60 ms ahead of the music you\u2019re trying to play along with. PCs reward you for playing perfectly in time by playing it back with a nasty delay. Well I can\u2019t compensate for it anyway. I\u2019ve trained myself to play in time. At no point was I deliberately practising how to play two thirds of a sixteenth note out of time with all the other instruments! I just never foresaw a time when I might have needed to be able to do that. Forget the PC and buy a dedicated digital multitrack workstation instead. The latency on those things feels far closer to zero and when you play back what you\u2019ve recorded it matches what you thought you played. It works. If you really have your heart set on using a PC then make sure it\u2019s not a laptop and make sure it\u2019s an i7. Make sure it\u2019s got a proper sound card in it and not just the toy one on the motherboard. Avoid external sound cards as they also add latency. You often have to switch out or completely remove other components which are introducing latency. It\u2019s a bloody nightmare and you have to learn SO much more than you want to just to get the thing half usable (unless you\u2019re very lucky with the PC you buy). Buy a Mac instead. I assume installing Linux might improve matters on a PC but don\u2019t know what decent software might be available for Linux. I basically know nothing about Linux and music. Back to the Mac: I\u2019ve used Garage Band and it\u2019s nowhere near as bad as using a PC - no glitches, less latency. Managed to record a song with my friends and at no point did we have to dig into settings or re-take because there\u2019d been a glitch in the recording halfway through the best take ever. Mac seemed to work ok. I don\u2019t have enough experience with them to say for certain that all Macs will be suitable. I assume you just want to go for the fastest one with the most memory you can afford. I spent \u00a3900 on my crappy Acer - it has a single headphone jack input and audio latency of 60 ms. I spent \u00a3370 on my Tascam digital multitrack. It has 24-bit audio, 32 tracks, built in effects, XLR connections, phantom power and zero latency as far as is noticeable (it can\u2019t truly be zero as it\u2019s doing analogue to digital and digital to analogue conversions which take a finite amount of time). You can make decent sounding music with that and there\u2019s loads of options. There\u2019s enough inputs to mic up a drum kit if you want for example. It\u2019s got dynamic compression built in for each channel if you want it too. It takes standard jack cables if you don\u2019t have XLR. The computer was a complete waste of money as far as music production goes. Sure, I can use it to mixdown tracks I\u2019ve recorded on my multitrack and it\u2019s great to be able to \u201csee\u201d the music, but my dedicated multitrack (the Tascam) also offers a whole load of mixdown options including multiband dynamic compression and EQ. I don\u2019t need the PC for anything much other than creating mp3s and adding overall flanger/phaser really. I can do everything else in my Tascam and it\u2019s all done by simply moving sliders and turning knobs until it sounds right rather than double-click, type in a number, listen to it back, double-click again, take a guess how much to adjust the number by, listen to it again, double-click the track, take another guess, etc.. PCs suck the humanity out of the music creation process. Tascam used to do a version which had a built in CD burner and the bay is still there so I can probably still add one and then I really wouldn\u2019t have a use for my PC other than typing stuff on Quora. The only criticisms I have of my Tascam is that it only has one headphone socket, there\u2019s a slight delay after recording each track before you can record the next one (I think that\u2019s it writing the track to the memory card - the data on the memory card doesn\u2019t appear to be compressed so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s compression time) and it can\u2019t be synced up with a MIDI device so I have to mixdown my MIDI to an audio and transfer it directly onto one of the Tascam\u2019s tracks. It means I lose one track if I want to be able to hear my MIDI stuff when I record the acoustic instruments and it makes it less than straightforward if I realise I want to change just one note. Otherwise perfect and less than half the price of my PC. I often find that a musical idea pops into my head and I grab my guitar to record it before it fades away. The PC takes longer than normal to boot then installs a Windows update which prevents my DAW from recognising the sound card when it starts up so I have to restart. When I finally get into my DAW I arm a track and record what\u2019s in my head. At this point using the Tascam I would probably disappear into the music for a few hours, refining it, adding bits here, removing bits there, recording snippets of melody which suggest themselves to me and at the end of the night I\u2019d have created a bunch of guitar tracks with loads of material I can build on. If I want to add drums I easily can because I\u2019ve played everything in time with the click (I normally start with the guitars and do the drums second or third depending how important the bassline is). What happens with the PC is I try to record a second track and notice that the click and the first guitar track aren\u2019t in time at all and it\u2019s really distracting. On sustained chords the click draws my ear and I shift into it\u2019s timing then when the riff starts again I am drawn back into synchronisation with that track. Once I add a couple more tracks it just becomes a mess because nothing really knows what it\u2019s trying to be in time with and there isn\u2019t a solid pulse to the music. Trying to add things with very definite and noticeable beat placements such as drums is impossible. I have to play out of time to play in time! Soon enough I get drawn into the menus of the DAW and sound options in control panel trying to do something about the latency. Nothing has any noticeable effect although if I reduce the buffers below 64 samples the sound starts to break up. I can make things worse, but not better. I end up so far down the rabbit hole that I just get angry about the fact I seem to be powerless to fix it and by that point the chance of making any decent music is out the window. I hate my computer. I\u2019ve lost a lot of tunes to it. In my opinion PCs are utterly useless for music recording unless you get really lucky with low latency components. Musically, they\u2019re toys and there\u2019s good reason proper studios don\u2019t just Ebay all their equipment and replace it with a PC or two. The modifications you might have to make to your computer in the pursuit of low latency might even reduce the performance of your games and spoil that for you too. I\u2019ve tried contacting Acer for help and advice - they\u2019re about as much use as a chocolate fireguard. Took them two months just to tell me that they had no solution for me! It\u2019ll work just fine for music production provided you have some other way to make the actual recordings. It\u2019s just not good at realtime stuff. You could actually get away with using a 20 year-old PC with a kick ass sound card in it for music production. I realise I\u2019ve answered this as if it was about music recording. Well, I suppose that is really quite a large part of music production so, although I\u2019m not sure, I think my answer is relevant. Hopefully. Save your money. Whatever PC you already have is probably good enough and spending more might not actually give you all that much more capability. If you\u2019ve got a spare \u00a3900 then you could spend ~\u00a3400 on a standalone multitrack recorder and keep the rest to upgrade your graphics card when the next must-have graphics card comes out so your games look awesome. That\u2019s a better spend of your money. On an almost completely unrelated note: My Tascam cost me exactly \u00a3370 and I ordered it on the 8th of March 2014. At that point I had not turned on my TV or read any news. 370 is significant to that day for a much more widely known reason\u2026 When I bought a DVD of Titanic I found out that the receipt showed I\u2019d bought it at 19:12\u2026 On the 14th of April\u2026 And a music-related joke to end on: I downloaded a pirate copy of Bohemian Rhapsody the other night. Total waste of time. It was shot from the back of a cinema and all I could see was a little silhouetto of a man! ",

For a PC to be good for music production you generally want it to have 3 things\u2014excluding external things like an audio interface or monitors: A strong CPUA good amount of RAMA lot of redundant storageA gaming PC generally does have a good CPU and an acceptable amount of RAM, so, not really any problems there. Sure, the GPU is basically wasted money for an audio workstation, but you sure could far worse then using a decent gaming rig for such. If you already have a decent* gaming rig and want to make music with your PC as well, you should be perfectly fine to just get an audio interface, some monitors and a DAW and you\u2019ll be good to go\u2014the PC\u2019s hardware should be no hindrance and, in fact, should be plenty strong enough to not run into any serious bottlenecks anytime soon.  *by \u201cdecent\u201d I generally mean something like an second generation or newer i5 and 8+ GB of RAM. The graphics card matters not in this case. Just to give a little idea how taxing music can get: my rig has an i7\u20136700 and 24 gigs of DDR4 RAM\u2026 I can max that CPU out if I want\u2014and sometimes do, especially when working on some guitar tone and I get sidetracked again, adding far more then needed\u2014but so far I didn\u2019t manage to max out the RAM\u2014but I do regularly get over 16 gigs and am practically always over 8\u2026 though the last thing might just be windows being somewhat inefficient seeing as I currently use 10 1/2 GB according to the task manager and I am doing nothing besides surfing the web and listening some music\u2014and yes, 3 gigs are just used by the browser\u2026 I really should close tabs when I don\u2019t need them.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. The two machines have different priorities, with some overlap and some divergence. Gaming machines are GPU-focused; but usually lots of horsepower and RAM too, maybe not quite as much focus on the storage. The one thing a gaming PC does that makes it potentially bad as a music production box is make a lot of noise. With all the fans, it introduces too much sound pressure into a room *if* you\u2019re recording with open mics. if you\u2019re all electronic/sequenced, this matters a lot less but can still color your mixes. [[EDIT - new PC specs]]My PC is a music production rig; it\u2019s a Core i7\u20139770K with 64GB RAM, a 1TB NVME SSD for boot/swap/temp/apps, a 1TB SSD for active recording projects and video rendering target, and 13TB worth of 7200RPM spindles for passive data storage/backup. My sound device is a USB3-connected Presonus Studio18|24, the onboard sound is disabled completely (8 inputs, zero-latency monitoring). Most importantly *it\u2019s in a case designed to be super quiet*; lots of insulative properties, almost no bare sheet metal to resonate, and highly efficient and quiet cooling. It clocks 24db at full utilization. You need lots of CPU in order to run a lot of plugins and virtual instruments simultaneously; you need a lot of RAM to hold a lot of audio files and samples in RAM at the same time, and you need fast storage to tolerate high bandwidth writes from multiple tracks at the same time. My graphics card is paltry by gaming standards (onboard Intel, using that because Adobe AfterEffects can utilize the GPU for rendering) because as has been said elsewhere, 3D graphics performance is essentially moot in a music production environment. and \u201cgaming\u201d for me is Spider Solitaire. ;) The audio and video monitors are a whole different discussion; and outside the scope of your question. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely! Everything that a great gaming PC consists of will be useful for a great Music production PC, except for the graphic card. Yup, you do not require a heavy duty graphic card for your music production, even if you make music for videos! A word of advice though, if you can afford go for an i7 rather than an i5! Unlike a gaming rig, which relies on the graphic card for all the juice, a music production relies on the cpu for all its juice! All the sample libraries, plugins and vst instruments rely on the cpu for smooth functioning! So get the best cpu you can afford. A gaming PC will make do with an i5 and an awesome Graphic Card, Music production will benefit more with an awesome CPU! Also make sure you have a separate hard drive(minimum 7200 rpm) for your OS, one for all your projects and one external drive for your sample libraries, loops, instruments, etc. It's not an absolute requirement, but having separate hard drives will definitely help in system performance. A slow hard drive will bogg down performance no matter how fast your processor is. Get 2 identical Ram sticks of your choice. The new Skylake processors support upto 2400 mhz of ram speed at stock speeds. So basically get the fastest ram that you can afford. Overclocking : A lot of Gaming rigs are overclocked! It's a privilege for PC owners. Get a k version of Intel processor, if you want to overclock. Though overclocking is not an absolute necessity, so it's all up to choice. Goodluck! ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely, depending on certain aspects of your gaming PC. Gaming PCs typically have high-performance components. Most money is spent on the GPU \u2014 the graphics card, which has very limited effect on performance for audio production. But sometimes, gamers spend less on the CPU, opting for just an i5-series CPU. For music production, i7 and i9 CPUs are preferred. Now if you spent for a premium gaming computer, you may have opted for a better i7 or i9, so you\u2019re in good shape. Assuming you have at least an i7, the next issue is storage. You want to add a dedicated drive (SSD or 7200rpm HD) for your audio recording. You don\u2019t want to record directly onto the boot volume where the OS and your installed applications live. One area where gaming PCs save money is on their cooling fans\u2026 i.e. they don\u2019t worry too much about noise, because most gamers are wearing headsets and don\u2019t really notice the noise. But if you\u2019re doing studio-type work, you might want to replace your gaming PC\u2019s fans with more premium, silent-type fans from companies like Noctua and BeQuiet! so that the ambient noise level from the computer is greatly reduced. So yes\u2026 gaming PCs can be great for this purpose, but you might need an upgrade here or there. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. As gaming computers usually have higher-end internal systems, installing and using a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) should be a smooth process. However, the opposite can\u2019t be said - I make music using Ableton Live on my laptop but I have tried to play games on it as well and that\u2019s a no-no: I need more space, a better soundcard, and better graphics, which means I\u2019d have to get a new computer to play games. But when running a DAW, all that really matters is that you have enough space to install it (and it\u2019s usually smaller in size than GTA V, for example), and a good soundcard (which most gaming computers have).

However, gaming PCs are usually optimized for a heavy graphics workload. They can get away with having a less powerful processor, in favor of having a really powerful graphics card. For music production, the CPU probably matters more than the GPU. You may also need to buy additional parts like a sound card to get better audio output! ",
