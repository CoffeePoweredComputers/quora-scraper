            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going a bit afar\u2026music, dancing\u2026sin generally\u2026 When I was a kid rock and roll was called \u201cmusic of the devil\u201d and dancing, movies, drinking, women wearing pants a big NO! (Smoking was only ok in the South) These rules were explained in some strange ways as though an individual had so little self control and was basically so depraved that the Church had to impose control. The counter to this thinking was the gradual change to upbeat \u2018Christian\u2019 music and the Jesus movement. A seeker friendly Church today with only a few rules (if any). (All Orthodox Church\u2019s have always used Ancient Chant. We have Chanters and Acapella Choirs, no bands or performers in the center of the Church. Performance is for concerts.) Many Church\u2019s didn\u2019t ever oppose all music outside the Church and didn\u2019t censor social drinking, dance, movies and so on. In the more traditional and ancient Church\u2019s, dancing is (and has been) normal at festivals and weddings. Wine is in the Eucharist. Wine and beer are normal at Feasts. I have a fond memory of my Priest in a cowboy hat singing Johnny Cash\u2019s \u2018Man in Black\u2019 (he and his wife are the best Greek dancers in our Parish! Our last big wedding had American folk dancing with fiddlers!   Pascha baskets 3am Feast to break the fast after 3 hour Liturgy! (BBQ with lamb and dancing the next day) Do I like all music? No! Some art, music, sculpture, film, photography is twisted. I\u2019m an adult and leave it alone. The World is full of beauty! God is Creator and creativity is in His creation\u2026in us. I look for those beautiful sparks from Arvo Part, Ansel Adams. The Beach Boys and a movie like the Hobbit. War and Peace. The Electric Slide and Greek dancing. A Small glass of wine at the Paschal Feast (Easter) to break the long fast. The controls I have on my behaviors are not forced artificially but given naturally. I choose even when there are some things I know that can have consequences if they are against Canon law. I\u2019ve been asked about my Church, the Orthodox Church and what I would have to do for the Church to excommunicate me. I be answered: The Church doesn\u2019t excommunicate you, you do it to yourself. You can still come to Church, but without repentance (turning from the breach), The Eucharist isn\u2019t to be received. Again, the responsibility is on the individual. You are treated as an adult who makes choices. ",

            "answer_text": "Pop music is not bad, but we should be mindful of what we listen to. Does It Matter Which Music I Choose? \u201cWhen I get ready for my day, I turn on my music. When I get in the car, I turn on my music. When I\u2019m at home relaxing, cleaning, even reading \u2014my music is on. I\u2019m always listening to music.\u201d \u2014Carla. Do you share Carla\u2019s enthusiasm for music? If so, this article will help you enjoy its benefits, avoid its pitfalls, and choose your music wisely. The benefitsThe pitfallsWhat your peers sayThe benefits Listening to music can be compared to eating food. In both cases, the right type in the right amount can be good for you. Consider: Music can improve your mood.Music can take you back in time.Music can create a powerful bond of unity.Music can help you cultivate valuable qualities.Did you know? The largest book of the Bible \u2014Psalms \u2014is made up of 150 songs.  Be as selective with music as you are with food The pitfalls Some music, like tainted food, can be poisonous. Consider why. Many songs contain sexually explicit lyrics.The Bible says: \u201cLet sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness or greediness not even be mentioned among you.\u201d (Ephesians 5:3) Ask yourself, \u2018Does my music hinder me from following that admonition?\u2019Some music can immerse you in sadness.The Bible says: \u201cAbove all the things that you guard, safeguard your heart.\u201d (Proverbs 4:23) Ask yourself, \u2018Does my music make me focus on negative thoughts?\u2019Some music can incite you to anger.The Bible says: \u201cPut them all away from you: wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk out of your mouth.\u201d (Colossians 3:8) Ask yourself, \u2018Does my music make me aggressive, perhaps even calloused to others\u2019 feelings?\u2019The bottom line? Be selective. That\u2019s what a teenager named Julie tries to do. \u201cI\u2019m constantly going through my music and deleting anything that I realize is inappropriate,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy, but I know it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d A young woman named Tara is learning something similar. She says: \u201cAt times a song with a great beat will come on the radio, but then I\u2019ll hear the lyrics and realize that I should change the station. Doing that is like tearing myself away from an amazing cinnamon roll after just one bite! But if I have the strength to reject a song about sex, I\u2019ll more likely have the strength to reject the act of sex before marriage. I don\u2019t want to underestimate the effect that my music can have on me.\u201d WHAT YOUR PEERS SAY \u201cMusic can change our mood tremendously, and if we\u2019re not on guard, the music we choose can have negative effects that we may not see until we are already hooked.\u201d \u2014Abigail. \u201cEven a song that you hear only a couple of times can be in your head forever. So it\u2019s good to reject a song immediately if it seems to be bad. Otherwise it will be etched in your mind.\u201d \u2014Robert. source: jw.org ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhatever is not of faith is sin\u201d Romans 14:23 What does that mean? Do you feel guilty when you listen to pop music? Why? If the content stirs up feelings that you don\u2019t feel comfortable with like lust or the desire to indulge in drinking or drugs particularly if you have struggled with those issues then maybe you shouldn\u2019t listen. Is it because you think others will find you less \u201cChristian\u201d if they find out and you are trying to fit in. That is a bad reason and leads to legalism. Conviction versus condemnation is hard to determine even for mature Christians. Conviction comes from the Holy Spirit and helps you avoid falling in ditches. Condemnation comes from the devil and is a guilt trip that produces negativity and behavior that eventually becomes judgmental of those that aren\u2019t as \u201choly\u201d as you. Lastly, could it cause others around you to sin? There are behaviors i don\u2019t indulge in like social drinking because I don\u2019t want my children to take the first step towards problem drinking or worse. Does that guarantee they won\u2019t? No but maybe if I talk to them about it they will make wise choices. Take it on a case by case basis. Some Christians should not listen to Some Pop Songs. Either way God has not fallen off his throne and he mercy is new every morning. Everything will work out regardless. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this fully depends on personal maturity and conviction. Motive for listening always matters. Some people have sensitivities to the influence of certain themes/lyrics/musical styles. If any song, book, movie, companion etc tempts you to think or do things you believe are wrong, then please avoid that trigger completely. Don\u2019t toy with anything that you already know has the potential to undermine your sense of spiritual integrity. Personally, I listen to an entire spectrum of musical genres for various reasons that range from light entertainment to achieving deeper understanding of the mindset of the individual who wrote/performed or listens to a given song. In the latter instance, I listen in order to develop a more complete understanding of the world and its inhabitants. And I observe the admonishment in 1 Thessalonians 5:20-21 (ESV) Do not despise prophecies, but test everything; hold fast what is good. If there is no good to be found, I\u2019m ok with moving a decidedly harmful influence out of my life. But I was not always able to embrace this level of responsibility-tempered-freedom without my conscience feeling violated in some way. For many years, my own immaturity required that I be very cautious about specific contacts that I made. The list is much shorter, now, but I still need to be honest with myself about where my own weaknesses and limits of association are located. I recommend that you also develop an awareness regarding your own personal boundaries. . ",

            "answer_text": "Depends. If you\u2019re more of a liberal christian and less religious, then most types of non-christian music might sound good to you. But if you\u2019re more of a conservative christian, then you may not want to listen to pop music entirely or as long as it doesn't have any sex, violence, or anything else that is immoral etched into the lyrics or the music video itself. I would like to clarify that the Bible nowhere condemns any particular style of music. The Bible nowhere declares any particular musical instrument to be ungodly or considered as a total sin. The Bible mentions numerous kinds of string instruments and wind instruments. While the Bible does not specifically mention drums, it does mention other percussion instruments (Psalm 68:25; Ezra 3:10). Nearly all of the forms of modern music are variations and/or combinations of the same types of musical instruments, played at different speeds or with heightened emphasis. There is no biblical basis to declare any particular style of music to be ungodly or outside of God\u2019s will. ",

            "answer_text": "For me it each song needs to be judged by it\u2019s own lyrics and beat. There are some songs in each genre that are good and uplifting. There are also songs that are angry and filled with hate. You be the judge since you\u2019re the one listening, but good music will lift you up and give you an appreciation for all the good things around you. The other kind of music will put you in a state of anger, sometimes aggression, and will give you poor outlook on life. As a Christian in his late 60s, I\u2019m sorry about some of the music I let my brain absorb during the \u201860s. Not all of it was bad, but there was plenty of bad music being played. It\u2019s possible that is one of the reasons our nation in such a turmoil today. Music is very powerful as it matches the rhythms of the human body, and the brain will absorb words/lyrics even what we don\u2019t hear them with our ears. Philippians 4:7\u20138 ",
