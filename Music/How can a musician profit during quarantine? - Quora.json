            "answer_text": "They offer a Pay Per View concert and have it beamed throughout the country. Big stars can afford to do that. Regular musicians can give private lessons or put up some YouTube videos to get your name out there. Beyond that, there\u2019s not much you can do except file for unemploment, which could take weeks or months. However, this Coronovirus will not last forever. For once, every country in the world is working toward one common goal. The best and brightest minds on the planet are working on a solution that has shut down the world economy. For the first time in history every country in the world is working together on a problem, instead of trying to come up with ways to kill each other. That is impressive. We all may have different beliefs, but for once, everybody in the world is combining their knowledge for the common good of mankind. As the late John Lennon sang \u201cImagine all the people sharing all the world.\u201d We may not like it, but it could lead to a period of world peace. Unlikely, but possible. ",

It will help to support them over this time they can't play live gigs. For the artist, if you are stuck at home, maybe you could sign CDs, and such, just like you would after a gig, when your fans order stuff online. Also, some musicians are giving on line lessons, another way to earn some money, while they can't tour. ",

This is an opportunity for accomplished buskers to entertain and lift their spirits. They may not raise much money - no-one recently laid off can afford that much - but it may be an incentive for forward-looking local councils to encourage this activity for the public good. ",
