            "answer_text": "Well, these are the best music videos in my book. A lot of the younger people probably don\u2019t know these, but I grew up in the era of MTV. These were the videos that always impressed me.  Thriller - Back when Michael Jackson was still amazing. It\u2019s one of his best songs, from his best album, and Michael Jackson\u2019s iconic dance choreography is a sight to watch. In addition, it has all these funky narrative parts that didn\u2019t need to be there, but they put it in for fun and it was a riot to watch. It is still the definitive music video \u2014 created the format of using music videos to tell a story and it is one of the best examples of the art ever made.  Smooth Criminal - another classic from Michael Jackson, this one was part of the \u201cMoonwalker\u201d experimental film and was the best part of it. You can see concepts he used in Thriller evolved to form this video. It\u2019s the kind of thing that people like Bruno Mars grew up watching.  Take On Me - this video was one of the most visually-striking videos from my childhood, if not the most impressive. It holds up today and yeah A-Ha is a great band too! This is there best song and I was simply amazed by the quality of the animation they made for this video. Also this was the 80s, when I was a kid and we all had fantasies of being drawn into our comic books like they did in this video!  On Your Mark - this is from Japanese duo Chage and Aska but the video impressed me so much when I first saw it. Daft Punk did the same trick getting some Reiji Matsumoto animation done for their series of videos, but this one is something special. Made by the master himself Hayao Miyazaki, this music video has a story so full of emotion I still tear up every time I see it. I first saw it on TV after watching an anime back in 1996 and I knew the instant I saw it that it was Ghibli, and it\u2019s something that has really aged well. They don\u2019t make animation like this anymore and this was done by the very best.  Interstella 5555 - speaking of Daft Punk, you can\u2019t not include this in the list. Technically not a music video, it\u2019s hard to decide exactly if it\u2019s supposed to be a music video, or a movie, or both. While nowhere as good as On Your Mark, it manages to create something truly special and unique. In a time where Marvel invented the cinematic universe, Daft Punk had invented the Music Video Universe, with a series of interconnected music videos telling a story about a galaxy far far away\u2026  Blurred Lines - This music video is so dumb and sexploitative, but there\u2019s just something mesmerizing about it and its inanity that no other sexploitative music video has ever managed to do, and pretty much every music video we have gotten in the past decade is a dumb sex bomb video. So that makes this the King of Sexploitation Videos, and that earns it a special spot on my list. And I especially like that it has a \u201cclean official\u201d version and the \u201creal\u201d version.  Money for Nothing - this is the second video I have on my list from director Steve Barron, who also made the second video on this list (Take On Me). While not as good as that one, this video was all the rage back in the 80s and was one of the iconic videos that launched MTV.  Never Gonna Give You Up - this is the music video that is at the heart of that unspeakable 2007 memetastic phenomenon, Rickrolling. It\u2019s the 80s music video for all you millennials out there, and I have enjoyed my fair share of Rickrolling through the years!  Sledgehammer - This video is something special. If you\u2019ve never seen it before, you\u2019re in for something unique and amazing. This is said to be the most popular music video of all time, and is the single most aired music video in the entire history of MTV.  Human Behavior - Bjork\u2019s video is mesmerizing and her music is tantalizing. This video is hypnotic in a way that works well. It\u2019s weird and disturbing but in a very good way. Give it a watch!  November Rain - probably the most iconic video of the 90s. It\u2019s an amazing song from rock legend Guns \u2018N Roses with some of the most breathtaking imagery and a heartbreaking story of a man losing the love of his life, the best friend dealing with both his grief and his complicated feelings by riffing off in front of a church in the middle of nowhere, and the wedding reception that goes to hell in the middle of the rain. Probably the most epic music video ever made.  ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite music videos by far are from the 1980s largely since I enjoy 80s music much better than music from the 90s and afterwards. There's probably some videos that I'm forgeting about and I'll add any that I remember. Take On Me - by the Norwegian band A-ha. The video was first shown in 1985, it was filmed in England, and the song was recorded in England in 1984. The lead singer taking the lady into the comic book is a classic. It's one of my favorite songs by them.  Train of Thought - by A-ha. The song was released in 1985. It's one of my favorite songs by them.  Don't Come Around Here No More - by the American band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The video was first shown in 1985, the song was released the same year, and the song was recorded in 1984.  Everybody Wants to Rule the World - by the English band Tears For Fears. The video was first shown in 1985, was filmed the same year in Southern California and England, and the song was recorded in England in 1984. The scenes of Southern California, especially in the desert where it shows the fake large Cabazon Dinosaurs, is great. It's one of my favorite songs by them. I saw them in concert.  Pale Shelter - by Tears For Fears. The video was first shown in 1983. I like it when Curt Smith is walking on the airfield and at the beginning when the alligator is shown in the pool. I like the song.  Secret Messages - by the English band ELO. The video was first shown in 1983. It\u2019s one of the many songs that I like from them. I've seen them in concert as The Orchestra.  Torture - by the American band The Jacksons. The video was first shown in 1984.  Transfer Affection - by the English band A Flock of Seagulls. The video was first shown in 1983. It has some good scenes of people dressed in astronaut type suits. The band members wear silver suits. It's one of my favorite songs by them. I'd like to see them in concert this year.  Take Me Home - by the English music artist Phil Collins. The video was first shown in 1985. It has nice scenes of places around the world. One of my favorite songs by him.  Your Wildest Dreams - by the English band The Moody Blues. The video was first shown in 1986 and was filmed in England. It shows a nice look into a lady going back to 1960s England. It's one of my favorite songs by them. I've seen them in concert 4 times and the lead singer Justin Hayward solo in concert twice.  Eyes Without a Face - by the English music artist Billy Idol. The song was released in 1983. It's my favorite song from him and it has a nice video. I saw Billy Idol in concert.  Walking on the Moon - by the English band The Police. It was filmed on October 23rd, 1979. It has some great scenes of the band performing in front of a Saturn V moon rocket on display outdoors at Kennedy Space Center. I\u2019ve seen the lead singer Sting in concert.  King For a Day - by the English band Thompson Twins. The video was first shown in 1985. It's a great video showing nuns with guitars dancing around the band. It's one of my favorite songs by the band. I\u2019ve seen the lead singer Tom Bailey in concert.

The Man Behind the Mask - by the American music artist Alice Cooper. The video was first shown in 1986. In my opinion the music video is better than the movie that the song is featured in, Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives. Alice Cooper is one of the funniest performers.
