            "answer_text": "Why not do both? Hendrix was a notorious off the rack kind of guitar buyer. So, when it came to Strats, he basically bought a standard; flipped the nut and strung it upside down. This made the staggered poling of the pickups the reverse of what they should be (meaning the high E was over the pole the low E usually uses) (the stock Fender staggered pole set up looks like this)  Also, when Jimi played, the pickups were reverse what they should be therefore changing the sound from what a normal Strat to something more Jimi-fied. That and he usually used the middle/bridge pickup selection (which he or his guitar guy would facilitate by jamming cardboard or some other damned thing to jam the 3-way switch into a hybrid position). So, if you want your PRS and your Strat too, you have one of two options: Buy this PRS\u2026 PRS 305 Electric Guitar Review And flip the pickups the other way round\u2026or\u2026 2. Split the coils on a regular PRS and get pretty close to the Jimi sound\u2026, but not quite. Of course, there are always other options beyond that, I simply chose two for the purpose of writing convenience. You could take a regular PRS and toss humbucker shaped single coils in it\u2026or who knows what. I hope this helps. ",

Jimi would have played a PRS because they are very good in all aspects of how a good instrument should be.... Fenders unique sound can be replicated on any electric guitar, check out Guitar Rig 5 Native Instruments. The older the Fender the more unique is the sound because of the pick-up technology and amplification of the time. The wiring of the electrics which could morph the sound has been replicated by many guitar manufactures over the years, the single coil 5 way toggle switched Strat's being an all time favourite.... Today's guitar manufactures have blow all illusions of grandeur out of the ball park ...... the electric guitar is no more a secret than menstruation.... ",
