            "answer_text": "To start a band, you need: other musicians, that you can get along with,who aren't too busy, and who want to play roughly the same thing you want to play.(I'm assuming you already have an instrument and kind of know how to play it) You need a venue in which you can meet other musicians. Meeting strangers via craigslist or something works about as well as dating online - that is to say, mostly badly. The best way to meet is to actually play together. Open mics, jams, and music circles are a good way to meet other people.  I have been in many bands over the years. Three of them were musically successful and sustainable for a reasonable period, and two of them are still active. Here are some stories... First band was a duo with a drummer (I'm a guitarist). We met when we were both auditioning for the same band. Neither of us joined that band, but we kept playing together. After several attempts to find bandmates or create structure, we found our calling in free improvisation, and played regularly that way. We haven't played together in several years and are in different places now, but it was a very good experience.  Second band (which still exists) was one I formed from two friends I met in filk music circles at science fiction conventions. One was a drummer/accordion player, the other was a banjo/whistles player. The band truly gelled a year later, when another guitarist/songwriter joined. The four of us are an extremely stable anarchist structure, with no leadership and unanimous decision-making. It's a great band to be in, because no matter what we do, it always sounds like us.  Third band (which still exists) formed when I offered to produce an album for another musician I had met through SF fandom. She and I had never played together before, although we'd heard each other at circles and gigs a bit. I planned to have a few different drummers play on the record for different feels, but the first one was the drummer from my second band. In the space of a single song, she declared him to be the only drummer she wanted. This band consists of the core trio, but has had three other official members over the years (all of whom are still technically members and welcome to join us whenever opportunity presents itself).  Despite the 50% membership overlap, these two bands are radically different structures. One is almost pure anarchy, the other has a strong leader. One has three different songwriters (plus covers and trad folk) and four different lead vocalists, the other has a single songwriter/lead singer with only the occasional cover. One sticks to simple pop/folk/punk structures, the other is mostly intricate progressive rock.  The point of all this is to say that a good band is more than the sum of its parts. You need to meet the other musicians, sure, but the particular chemistry of a band is magical. So it's not just a simple matter of putting drums, bass, and guitar in a room together! That's not a band, that's just musicians playing over each other.  So go meet people. Jam with them. See what works. And find the right people to mix together. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going to be fairly negative here I'm afraid. Having played in bands for 22 years, I've experienced a fair amount of very good and very bad times. The first thing I'd say is: do it for the enjoyment of playing music. Don't do it for any other reason, otherwise you'll end up resenting everything about it.  The painful truth is, the chances of you being signed and living the rock and roll dream are very slim indeed. Gone are the days where talent scouts go to gigs to find talent. Record companies now just create 'talent' themselves.  Secondly, musicians are generally short sighted, lazy assholes. That's just one of life's truths I'm afraid - the very definition of being a musician just attracts the type of people who want maximum reward for minimum effort. I've generally ended up 'leading' the last couple of bands I've been in because frankly, it's just easier than trying to force other members to put the requisite effort in. I don't mind doing that (I'm a bit of a control freak!), but you might.  All that aside, I've had some truly excellent times as a musican and I genuinely love writing, recording and performing music. It's one of life's true joys. The best times I've had in bands have been when I've found some really decent mates to play with, so if you start out in bands and someone's an idiot, deal with it quickly - either chuck them out of the band or move on - don't waste your time as it goes by far too quickly.  Like people have said already, being in a band is hard work - be prepared to work hard to get people to your gigs, promote your band etc. It is easier in some respects these days though - you can record your own DIY demos on a shoestring and I've captured perfectly decent recordings of rehearsals just using my iphone with a mic in the headphone jack. Also, social media can be very effective, but only if you use it wisely. Facebook has become pretty much saturated with bands to the point where most people just ignore event invitations due to the sheer amount they are sent.  Finally, try and pick your gigs intelligently - don't just go for anything for the sake of playing and try not to book too many gigs too closely together otherwise, unless your band is truly awesome, you'll reduce the potential crowd you could draw if you did less. Try and work with promoters and venue owners etc to make sure you're put on bills with bands that will compliment what you do so you both get the results you want - big crowds.  So, to summarise, absolutely do it - it's great fun, just try and keep the righ perspective and be realistic about what you expect to get out of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Its hard to find people that want to start a band. You are pretty young, so it might be a little harder for you to find people who want to just up and join a band rather than do anything else a teen would want to do. I would say for now, you should practice, practice, practice... then practice some more. Record yourself and put it on social media. Social media is your friend! Do covers and record them, post them to facebook, twitter, instagram, anything, just to get yourself and your talent out there. When you do, you will be able to find people/friends who have the same interest. Thats the best way to make connections, and eventually, form a band. Getting inspiration for songs is another things a band would be helpful for. You can bounce ideas off eachother, brainstorm and do all that stuff, and a lot of time, well in my situations, jamming with my band was the best way to make awesome tracks! A lot of writers do songs from life situations and things like that, so you just need to go out and experience life. A perfect topic for a song- friends who bail. BOOM. In all honesty, its just how you feel. Anyway, when you do start a band, you need to make sure that you can mesh with the band. A lot of people have different playing styles, and if you don't blend, your music won't be as beautiful as you want it to be. You all need to have the same interest, or compromise with similar interests. If you want to play punk rock, make sure you get a drummer who wants to play that rather than jazz... things like that. Also, don't just think you can get away with just practicing once a week, you ALWAYS need to be practicing. The thing I hated most was when I would come to practice and my drummer/singer/bassist didn't know the words/chords or whatever to the song we were covering. Practice and practice to better yourself and your band! Music is an incredible thing, and you can use it in so many ways. Its an art, use it to write your own story, to paint your own picture, but to make the outcome beautiful, you need to practice. So get yourself out there man! ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely. Pick up a bass and start playing. I've played guitar, bass and drums with different bands over the years, so I'll give you some advice here. 1. Define your goals I first joined a band back in 2003, when rock music was still cool. Bands like Jet and The Strokes, and then Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance, actually had hits on the radio. At the time, people still liked rock music. A band could actually make it. Today, few rock acts get big, maybe Arcade Fire or someone but you aren't going to be selling records like Blink-182 or Oasis did in the 90's.  Thus, you need to define your goals. If you want to get signed and release a record in a niche genre (lika ska or something), then go for it. It doesn't hurt to be realistic. I knew I would never be in a professional band, but I still loved playing, so I stuck with it. My goal was to play in bands which played cover songs at school shows, house parties, and local bars. Over the years, all the bands I joined played covers at live venues such as these. It is a lot of fun, especially when the audience gets into it.  2. Find the Right People This is tough. You need to find people that like the same kind of music, and that have a similar skill level as you. I first started playing in a band after two years of playing guitar. The friends I was with had been playing their instruments for 6 years at that point. I was always stuck playing rhythm guitar, and was never able to fully develop my guitar skills. I wound up taking up bass and drums as well, so that I could be a more flexible musician, as opposed to being exceptionally skilled in one area. The point is, find people that like the same kind of music and that you are actually able to play along with.  Don't forget, people's personalities will really show through when you start playing together. Some people will be too busy to practice, others will be really bossy. Practicing for a live show is a team effort, and you really need to learn to work as part of a team in order to be successful. 3. Be Flexible Once you find your band, you will need to be flexible. You might not always want to play a certain song, but if you cooperate with your band, they will play a song that you want to play. Also, taking up extra instruments is great, because you can start playing with multiple bands with different needs. Playing niche instruments, like melodica, harmonica, or mandolin, can make you attractive to other bands looking for someone to fill in on a song. Learn as much as you can, and enjoy. Here is a shameless self plug for the group I've been playing with on and off for the last 6 years. The three of us have never played a live show as a group, but we have had tons of fun jamming in basements over the years. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzDTGSvcELY ",

I'm a professional bass player, I can tell you about bass, but more important is what you hear when you listen to music. When a tune really turns your crank, what are you listening to within the tune? If it's a particular instrument, maybe you gravitate towards that instrument. If it's a lyric, or the album art, or the SFX, or the overall vibe, maybe your talents lie along those lines. So is it bass?  As for a band, Dave Grohl said it best:  http://abandonedandheartbroke.blogspot.com/2013/05/get-in-their-garage-and-just-suck.html Just make noise and record it with just one mic in a room (used to use a cassette recorder for this, use today's version, don't worry about tones, just learn what you sound like in a room) and listen, and determine what sucks, address and fix it, and do it all again. Sometimes you'll laugh, sometimes you'll cringe, but EVERY TIME you'll get better.  Do it because you love it, don't worry about fame, money, sex, any of that. That stuff happens, yes, but not reliably enough to make it worth it (I've been doing this over 20 years, just take my word for it). It's the best terrible way (or the worst awesome way) to make a living, so you just have to love the act and process of making music, independent of money, appreciation, any of that. If you're good, and you work really hard, and you give your life to it, you'll have a wonderful thing. If you're lucky, you'll also have a career. Good Luck!! Edit: I didn't address what the other answers did, like finding like-minded friends and putting ads on Craigslist; if you're 14, you're already better at that than I am. I'm speaking to positioning yourself lifewise to start a band. Be uninhibited! And when you fail, fail beautifully, learn from it, let yourself grow from it, and keep going. And when you succeed, own it, enjoy it, let yourself grow from it, and keep going :) ",

            "answer_text": "I started a band when I was 17. Like you, I play guitar and I sing. I had 2 friends also playing the guitar so we decided to play together, just for fun. One of these friends who also played a bit a drums decided he would play this instrument instead. We went to his place to play songs we liked. We were very bad, we didn't have good equipment, and no experience of playing together. But little by little, we started to know each other more and more (music-wise) and identified the songs that had potential.Because we were a curiosity to our friends, some of them with a little experience of playing an instrument wanted to join our \"band\". We found somebody to play the bass, this person quit after few months, then we found a drummer, so our initial drummer played the bass, but our new drummer was actually not good, so we \"fired\" him, and finally we found a bassist, and alsa a female singer who played the piano. Only then our band was able to play properly.This line-up was not at all what we expected at the beginning (especially having a pianist/female singer) but we found songs that fitted this team.I realised then that each of the band members had different expectations:- The lead guitarist wanted our band to be a cover band.- The drummer wanted to play live. He was the one who got us our first gigs.- The bassist just wanted to spend good times with friends.- Myself wanted to play songs we wrote and record them.We found the compromise to play about half cover songs and half songs we wrote. We did few concerts. We joined an association which provided rehearsal/recording studios and we met other bands. With the other bands, we organised \"festivals\" (basically our bands played in a field in the middle of the countryside and we used our friends to promote it).The conclusion is that you should just find friends with similar musical interests and start playing. Then it's just a matter of opportunities. ",

            "answer_text": "The best advice I'd give is to post actual physical flyers (not digital internet Facebook/Twitter/Instagram) in your local music stores.  Say who you are, what you do, what type of music you play or want to play, and what you're looking for.  Example:  Guitarist looking for band.  Style somewhere between Progressive Melodic Death Metal and Adult Contemporary.  Influences include, Napalm Death, Anne Murray, 2Pac, Conway Twitty and early Tiffany.  Looking for a drummer, bassist & rhythm guitarist.  Singing ability is a bonus but not a requirement.  Must have own gear and be willing to practice in my parents' garage.   Something like that.  But don't write exactly that.  There are typically dozens of these in every music store so your personality needs to show through a little bit in order to attract like-minded musicians that you're likely to form bonds with.  Many famous groups were formed exactly this way.  This is a good way to meet other musicians and potentially form lifelong musical friendships.  Once you're all hanging out together in a musical setting the inspiration will come.  One riff, rhythm or chord will lead to something that leads to something else and before you know it you've written a song.  Music is a beautifully collaborative process that's best done with people who give and receive mutual respect for each other.  Hang out at those same music stores too.  Most musicians desire that actual interaction with other musicians in the real world.  You'd be surprised how easy it is to make friends when you hear someone play a song that you like.   And don't worry about your age.  I was playing drums in a band when I was 13 and the other members were all 17 or older.  I couldn't drive but they'd always help me get my gear from point A to point B.  You'll learn over the next 50 or so years that music transcends age groups and maturity stigmas.  I've been in bands where I was the youngest yet felt like I was the most mature; and I've been in bands where I was the oldest yet felt like the least experienced.  If you're still living with your parents then of course they'll want to have a say in who you hang with and where you go/play/perform/rehearse, but other than that, age was never an issue for me.   At this young age the music will come more freely when you're playing with people who you get along with and feel comfortable opening up around creatively.  Later on if music has to pay the bills you may end up joining bands with people you hate just to have a few dollars in your pocket; but that's not till later.  You're at the beginning of the best journey you could hope to have in life.   Start a band.  Make music.  Little else matters.  Best of luck!! ",

So difficulty come from youth but nothing can stop a determine person. If not experience with instrument you must practice much for learn playing. I wish for know why not like violin. Depend on reason this maybe problem. Do not choose bass only if believe easy. Compare other instrument it can be easy but also depend on music you play. If take lesson or work diligently alone you probably get enough experience in 1 year. At same time meet other player. For start band this can be difficult. Must find players compatible for style, temperament, sometime age. Older you become this can be not so much problem. As often possible play with other. This help you to grow as musician much. Depend what you have for goal you may learn many style music. If goal is become rock star this very difficult. If just want play for audience this easier. Band play cover song people want listen can obtain gig easy compare to only original song. Most band problem from personality of member but other problem come from venue or promoter not want pay or make change have no regard for band. Best play from love of music not money, fame, etc. Play with band very rewarding experience and also frustrating experience. Always remember 2 words in music business. Must love music but never forget the business aspect. I not know if I help you. I play guitar professionally in music theater band. I play most music I not love but it pay my bills and I love the people I play with. We have much fun and great friends. For music satisfaction I play in cover band of music I enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you in any music school or band club in your high school of some sorts? If so, often the chances of forming a band and jamming with them are a lot higher. Find a group of like-minded individuals and express your interest to jam with them. I formed a band back in high school with my friends, and we just jammed covers of tunes by Creed, Nirvana, System Of A Down, and other modern rock bands. The experience was fun, although the band split after we graduated, despite us still being good friends with each other. In university, I passed the audition of a band club and was allocated to one that covered tunes by The Beatles, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Cranberries, and others. However, the busy life of a final year academic took over and I got stuck in dissertations and essays to complete, having not much time to play in bands for a while. Eventually, after university I enrolled myself to a music school to improve my chops as a guitar player (vocals are my main instrument but I also play guitar occasionally and want to improve my skills on them), and I got myself a group of friends that I jam with, all way older than me and two even married (i.e. the drummer and the bassist). Trust me, if you know a group of friends who would like to jam with you or are a member of a band club or a music school of some sorts, the chances are even easier. I hope you will successfully find a band that you can jam with someday. Rock on as always! ",

            "answer_text": "Kevin McAleer (as well as many others on this thread) made some good points. To expand on Kevin\u2019s section on defining goals of yourself and your constituents, higher goal alignment is correlated to higher commitment. Commitment is necessary for music aims like gigging and getting signed to a record label. However, that is from a structural perspective of a band, like a car and its many parts whether it is its wheels or an engine, and a band needs each part to work together to achieve its mission. Of course a band (or any organization for that matter) is complex and, yes, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. What about dealing with the uncertainty of success or potential power struggles? Even the best analysts can get it wrong and can dig deep into your pockets. I also recommend to\u2026. Incorporate a strong, rich informal and formal culture. Along with working hard and being effective, it is good to include areas that give life, give spirit, add meaning and meet human needs. There can be a lot of bad blood in a music project whether it is fighting for the spotlight or people blaming others or desiring higher pay or something worse! What can anticipate these things from escalating into inefficiency and ineffectiveness is incorporating rituals for social bonding or \u201cbeing down to earth.\u201d They can be meetings or hanging out at the roller rank or a restaraunt. Another way is to incorporate celebrations. Celebrations are less frequent than rituals and can be used to leverage the band like parties or bi annual meetings. You can use these examples or create your own, and there are many more ways to attain a strong formal and informal culture . Consider the movie, \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d\u2026. The cast from the movie, Suicide Squad, not only were meticulous in their craft, they had a rich informal culture as well. The cast tattooed each other and formed an exclusive chat group, sending each other humorous messages. Jared Leto, who was heavily devoted to the Joker character even when the cameras were not shooting, and Jai, who streaked off set, became myths. Cara lightheartedly performed pranks on other cast members. Margot, who played Harley Quinn, remarked that this cast is \u201clike a family\u201d during a google interview. These things added to working as a team, pride, and good memories/experiences even though sometime prior to its release, more people knew little about these characters/comic book and were attracted comparatively more to Batman or X men or Avengers.

            "answer_text": "It can and should be a great idea. Like any endeavor it also can be catastrophic, but I'll get into that later. If you're truly fascinated by music, participating in it, thinking about it and finding your niche within it is pretty transcendent. It's at once empowering and humbling in all the best ways and your mind and emotions really get to think and feel deeply challenging and moving things. Bands can be dramatic and you have to deal with a lot of personalities and learn how to compromise and collaborate. This is a very difficult thing to negotiate but it's a great tool to understand people and how to deal with them and ideally become an assertive, compassionate person. It can be very painful learning these skills (trying to curb your personality defects, oversized ego, need for control, etc.) But this can be very constructive.  Bands are a great vehicle for being social. You get to play in front of people, meet a variety of creative types, maybe even meet girls. You can participate in a music scene and feel like you have real camaraderie and agency to make something from scratch. This is great. Bands make you cool (until you become old, like me). I've been in bands my whole life and I've had many painful experiences in them. I had an inflated ego, I was controlling, insecure, I've burned bridges, I've become incredibly frustrated with not accomplishing what I've set out to do and I've experienced a great deal of jealousy for my peers getting more accolades than I did. I still make these mistakes, but less now.  It made me feel like an ugly, petty person but I think observing that made me confront the traits in myself that I didn't like and have been very instructive in repairing them. If you can take time to observe yourself, this is very meaningful and will impact the quality of all your relationships.  Honestly, most of the time things don't sound \"Right\" and it's incredibly frustrating but you have these fleeting moments when everyone is firing on all cylinders or the germ of an idea enters the practice space and your spirit is truly elevated.  Being in a band can be difficult, but if you have the right attitude and are surrounded by the right people it's one of the best situations to be in. Allow yourself to fail and follow your interests and eventually you'll be part of something you're very proud of.  ",

I started around the same time, playing guitar and starting to perform and sing when I was 13 - no-one else my age was doing it, and there was almost no place for someone that young to perform.  a couple of questions - where do you live? city? country? town? I'm from a small-ish town.   Do you sing too?   I got tired of trying to find other people to play with and just started playing by myself on the acoustic in school. School is the best network - 8th grade was perfect. Sometimes I just brought my guitar to lunch or my free period and sat outside and played. I don't know if that's allowed where you are, but you'd be amazed at how many teachers would help your cause and support you if you wanted to get something together. I was playing at little assemblys and sometimes on stage at lunch periods, then the chorus wanted me to learn a few songs and play with them. Music teachers were so supportive. THEN - a whole bunch of other kids started taking lessons and the rest of the kids were asking ME if I wanted to play wth them. there is nothing un-cool about playing guitar at an early age, i was already the best! ha!  By the time we got to summer, i was jamming with all different kinds of kids - alot that i didn't really know before..some i didn't even like, but they all wanted to play music, I just went with it.   youth is such an advantage, we were able to play at little town sponsored events, dances and little acoustic all ages things in cafes or even in bars sometimes (as long as adults would take us and vouch for us) I wish it were that way now 20 years later....AND we were fucking terrible. we didn't have any of our own songs. i guess people thought we were bad-ass or at least cute.   create your own scene dude. these were the days before social media, but you might make a FB site for musicians in your age in your town and schools. see who bites. it's a good way to make friends and have adventures.   just think a little about what kind of music you WANT to play and eventually, kids in your area will probably come to you that have similar tastes!  good luck. if you want any advice...hit me up personally.

Develop the management skills to run a diverse group of egocentric artists who are also friends, then choose a group of musicians who can get on with each other and play reasonably well. They need to be pretty determined, steady-minded and energetic. Work them into a dedicated group. If you are lucky, some of this will come naturally. Form a partnership agreement with some decent advice about who owns the band name, equipment, song rights, and how the income (if any) and expenses (there will be expenses) are to be shared. Doing this will encourage the industry to take you seriously, if you are going the traditional path, and might help the band overcome or avoid future disagreements. Someone is going to have to get familiar with the details of bookings, venue requirements, travel, promotion and publicity. Doing interviews, organising press, merchandising.

            "answer_text": "Kevin pretty much nailed this answer, but I'd just like to emphasize two more things.  You really need to network.  Whether you're headed in the same musical direction as another musician or not, it is always crucial to branch out.  You might just find that certain styles or genres that you had never previously thought about actually fit your tastes quite well.  In addition to \"being flexible,\" you also need to focus on not merely \"going along\" with a song, but also making it your own.  Own every piece you play. Secondly, you need to stay personally active and motivated.  Too many times I've seen \"musicians\" start bands with the mindset that everyone is created equal.  That statement may hold true for humanity in general, but it is one that can most certainly not be applied to every musician.  You need to make sure that your personal studies and musical devotion are strong enough to carry a musical career on their shoulders.  Never fall prey to the mindset that \"once you have it, you'll never lose it.\" ",

            "answer_text": "I have been playing bass for over 30 years. I started playing at age 16. Makes sure you get a quality instrument(can\u2019t go wrong with Fender). If you wanna play bass you need to devote time to practicing. There is a difference between being passable and proficient. Once you get to a passable level(you can keep a steady beat and you play the basic notes properly) then you can start auditioning for bands. I actually was told \u201cno\u201d several times before I was accepted into a band. By that time I had learned enough songs through these rehearsals. This made it much easier. Just understand that the music business is fickle. People tend to have little loyalty and come and go easily. Also, do not play for the money because it takes a while to make any real money. Just have fun and let the chips fall where they may. Nothing like playing for a live audience. ",

I don't know what bass guitar reads in (I'm assuming bass clef?) but the transition will be even harder if the clef\u2019s different. You should play whatever instrument you want, but don't just go out and buy the most expensive bass you can find. Also, the bass player is often the most underrated/underappreciated band member. On one hand, you might feel a little left out when you're getting the least attention in your own band. On the other, maybe you'll start a Respect the Bassist movement :D ",

Bands are started when you meet people who feel the same way you do about music, and you guys share the same intensity... and don't care about being embarrassed. Just learn how to play 5-7 songs on the bass then find other people who love those songs. I joined my first band when I was 19, so don't listen to anyone that makes you feel like you gotta have great gear or be an expert from day one. Best of luck! ",

Alternatively, depending on your location, a local music store where musicians frequent or hangout might also be a good place to network.   Age shouldn't be a barrier, though. I've been following Igor Falecki (drummer) since he was 10 (now 14), and he has been playing with musicians from 9 through no upper age limit. Here he is jamming with friends:    ",
