            "answer_text": "You could use a SoundCloud bot to monetize SoundCloud tracks. SoundCloud play bots can do wonders to create a good social impression. There are positive and negative ones as in any type of online service. On the other hand, it can be saving time and energy, and in some cases, even money can be a perfect way. The software would do most of the job, providing consumers with more space and resources to advertise their products or websites, rather than spending time to manually collect likes. There are plenty of SoundCloud play bots out there you can purchase. Some of them are of the best apps, some don't (fraud). There are a lot of scams and spammy websites out there. So, users have to be cautious and make wise choices. Third parties can store cookies or attempt to access their passwords on a person's computer. This AIO SoundCloud bot can not only generate countless plays on your songs, but also help you upload, play songs/albums/playlists, auto follow/unfollow people, Like/Unlike Tracks,Like/UnLike Album/Playlist, and you can get more features in the future.
