It's a bittersweet song talking abt a sad past but showing hope for the future. here's part of the lyrics: \u201c I know there is no point if it stops even in the dark, fight it it's a blaze toward a blurred future that is literally shaking one way road I know the current condition lame it's a one way road, on a long and steep road one way road looking for yourself in style always be myself Gotta end it tonight to start again ready for a new fight , time for a slayin \u2026 A voice that will reach you wherever you are Leave and just protect it as you are, we go hard now with this sound Gotta stay strong what I built return to zero ground up How ugly don't burn it, burn them and cut in the dark Start a new phase it's a new phase, coming 'up A scene that opens in front of you when the night ends yes, I see I'm afraid I'm not going back again, now I can see the light I can not meet you alone, finding my own way to make it, if your trip is scary Gotta end it tonight (End to start) to start again (end to start) Ready for a new flight, time for a slayin Gotta end it tonight (end to start) To start again Ready for a new flight (end to start) Time for a slayin\u201d NCT 127 - End to Start lyrics + English translation Simon Says It talks abt how we're restricted by social norms how our life is dictated to us by society and if we don't follow trends we are counted as outcasts (vibe killers) & how you should not be afraid to break the norm & change up & get out of the control society has over you, also if you believe in these stuff it can also be about how certain organization ate controlling us & how we all subconsciously don't want to break free bc we've been programmed by social media etc. To not care anymore. Honestly this song is perfect if you wanna get hyped up for a revolution Part of the lyrics(not exact translations there are better ones on tw) \u201cYo, Simon says Hurry up, so many flat hoops on the street The moment I stop, I'm gonna aim and shoot for you Hands up, turn around Hands up, shake it up Running out of breath but I keep running Why are you just scooping things out standing there Why do you look so scared? Do you want this Cast a spell, I'm God, bewitching you all like Bless me achoo Simon says be cool Don\u2019t be such a fool Simon says we\u2019re real vibe killer The mood is getting high high high high All the sounds that try to stop us, bye bye bye bye Don\u2019t mind them, let\u2019s party all night Don\u2019t care what anyone says Don\u2019t be afraid The only one stopping you is you Don\u2019t misunderstand Today, we break the rules Open your eyes and wake up Fall deep inside The moment you find your true self Between reality and dreams\u201d NCT 127 - Simon Says lyrics + English translation Limitless This is their first installment in NCT's universe it talks abt seeing someone bright & extraordinary & realizing that person is the future you the improved version of you the one you always dream of becoming (the limitless you). There's actually a part where they say oh baby it's you that's actually them talking to their future limitless self in NCT's dream world Parts of the lyrics: \u201cThe dream that shook up my world last night Was it a nightmare, am I still in that dream? Following the light that pulled me, I\u2019m in a maze There, I discovered another passage The space is opening from the bottom up A persistent call inside a strange darkness Then I saw you, who resembles me I\u2019m you and you\u2019re me I\u2019m following the light and sound That knocks and wakes me up I felt shivers, I finally realized Oh baby it\u2019s you It\u2019s only the beginning, the limitless me From the start of the East to the end of the West The light gets stronger As it spreads through the darkness Open your eyes My song is getting louder Did you see? That hot and explosive world? Can you hear? We have become one Baby I don\u2019t want nobody but you\u201d NCT has a lot of good lyrics one of my favorite is 7th sense & Yestoday but since you asked for NCT127 I won't get into NCT U but you should really check out their lyrics & make sure to read the comment section of the MVs there all a lot of insightful takes on the lyrics in the comments ",

We all know that idols are aware of the hates that they are receiving and yet they remain silent. And I think music is their way to show what they really want to say to those people who keep on giving hates on them\u3161 they don't really have to say anything. Just listen to their music. ",
