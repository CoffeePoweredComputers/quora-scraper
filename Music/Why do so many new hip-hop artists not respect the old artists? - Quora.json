            "answer_text": "Click-bait. Generational conflict as a big argument starter and shadow labels (most of the artists being referred to are on labels that are strategically invisible to the public), wanted to capitalize on this to increase streams. They would get an artist with a hit, and have them use antics to boost streams for that song until it was worthless to them. They would then hold the artist from making any more music, I\u2019ll explain why later. To increase these streams they would use the contract leverage over what the artist says or does publicly to encourage artists to stay things that would stoke arguments. There was a time that a wave of them \u2018had never heard a biggie song\u2019, then there was the \u2018tupac is boring\u2019 wave, then the \u2018I\u2019m not a rapper I\u2019m a rockstar\u2019 wave, then the \u2018exploitative allusions to being homosexual\u2019 wavy. Ignorant older fans would fall for it, start arguing and younger people would then feel obligated to defend their \u2018generation\u2019. I\u2019ve seen these contracts before. They\u2019re extremely controlling, exploitative and transparently dead end. The company puts 0 dollars into promoting your album but collects all forms of pay from it, your concert and merchandise proceeds, etc. The best bet for them is an artist that makes one song and goes away because that one hit is going to have the most favorable income to effort ratio. Instead of trying develop an artists career for another song, they simply look for a new artist with a song that\u2019s moving all on it\u2019s own and do the same thing to them. When you see that all saying the same things at the same time (don\u2019t listen to biggie, don\u2019t like tupac, etc) it\u2019s because the same shadow label owns them. ",

            "answer_text": "Derick Ofodirinwa\u2019s answer is awesome. However, while it does generate clout, it its also because, if they can surpass the old artists its like declaring yourself king of the rap game. For example. Lets say if someone dissed Eminem better than Eminem dissed them, than this shows that you are Amazing. So these younger artists might just have something to prove. Follow me for more. ",
