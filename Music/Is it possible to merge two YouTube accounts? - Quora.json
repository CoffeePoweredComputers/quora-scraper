Moving a YouTube channel from one Google+ identity to another: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3056283 Use a different name on YouTube than your Google Account If you want to use a name or photo on YouTube that's different from what you have for your Google Account, connect your channel to a Brand Account. You can do this to support your business or brand identity on YouTube without showing a connection with your personal Google Account. When you connect a YouTube channel to a Brand Account: Your Google Account is an owner/manager of the Brand Account connected with the YouTube channel. This lets you access the YouTube channel from your Google Account.There's no public association between your Google Account and the Brand Account, so viewers won't see your name or email address (unless you publicly link them yourself).You can manage multiple channels from one Google Account. This helps if you have more than one YouTube channel.You can add other managers and owners to your Brand Account. You and any teammates or collaborators can manage the channel without having to share passwords. Learn more about managing channels connected to Brand Accounts. Connect channel to a Brand Account You can connect a new or existing channel to a Brand Account. Create a new channel With a Google Account, you can watch, like, and subscribe. Google Accounts don't come with a YouTube channel by default. Without a channel, you have no public presence on YouTube. To upload, comment, or make playlists, create a public YouTube channel. Currently, this can't be done in the Android or iOS YouTube apps, but you can use the mobile site or a computer. Create a personal channel with your name Make sure you're signed in to YouTube.Try any action that requires a channel, such as uploading a video, posting a comment, or creating a playlist.If you don't yet have a channel, you'll see a prompt to create a channel.Check the details (with your Google Account name and photo) and confirm to create your new channel.Create a channel with a business or other name On a computer or in a mobile browser, make sure you're signed in to YouTube.Go to your channel list.If you want to make a YouTube channel for a Brand Account that you manage, choose the account from the list.

Connect an existing channel Sign in to your YouTube account.Click your account icon > settings .Next to your profile picture, click Advanced.If you already have any Brand Accounts, you'll see them listed under \"Account information.\" When you choose one of these, your YouTube channel will be renamed to match the page. If the Brand Account has any other managers, they'll also be able to manage the channel from now on. If you don't see your Brand AccountIf your Brand Account isn't listed, your YouTube channel's Google Account is not a manager of that Brand Account. You have to first add your Google Account as a manager of the page.Note that some content can't be moved: All comments, sent and received messages, and automated filter community settings. You'll see a warning if your channel has this content. Note: When you're using the Brand Account, you may also see an unusual email address in some places, such aschannel-name-1234@pages.plusgoogle.com. This isn't a real email address and doesn't mean you have a Google+ page \u2014 it's just an identifier for the Brand Account. You can have a Brand Account without having a Google+ presence. Email notifications for the YouTube channel go to the notification address that you can set for the Brand Account. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Disconnecting a Google+ page and merging an existing page with Youtube: The first step is to make a note of the email address and Google account which your Youtube channel is setup up with. 1. Make sure that the existing Youtube account is added as a Manager to your Google+ page (Which is done under the Managers section of your Page Settings) 2. If a duplicate or alternate page has been created by mistake via Youtube, you\u2019ll need to disconnect that Google+ presence by clicking on Disconnect in Youtube Settings, in the Name section. 3. Google will take around 20 minutes to proceed through the disconnection process. It\u2019s a good time to get a drink and relax! 4. Now go back into Youtube Settings, and click on Advanced. You should then have the option to link the Youtube account to a Google+ Page. Click on that link and you should be able to select the correct page. 5. Once that\u2019s done, you should be able to click on Edit to be sent to the Page where you can click on Posts etc to check it\u2019s the correct one. 6. Once that\u2019s all done, you can then go into Google+ with your original Youtube account and remove the Page created in error. ",
