            "answer_text": "I would say that the brand of phone that you use should be the brand of headphone. I was a Redmi Note 4 user and I bought the earphone of Redmi costing Rs. 599/- which worked perfectly on Note 4 plus on Note 7 Pro bought by my cousin, but as soon as I tried them on my new Oneplus 7(through type C Connector), it just was too heavy for my ears, My ears would get tired within just 20 mins of music. As soon as I bought Oneplus Type C headphone, the problem got solved. However, if you want durable headphones with no brand preferences, MI earphone may serve the purpose. ",
