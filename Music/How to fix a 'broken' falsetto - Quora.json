            "answer_text": "I hate to answer a question with a question, but\u2026 here goes: What is a \u201cbroken\u201d falsetto? I mean, what do you mean by this? It\u2019s not exactly standard singers terminology (at least, not to me, or any of the sources I\u2019ve checked), so I\u2019ll be glad to edit/update this pretty unhelpful answer if you can give some more details. Also, throw in an audio or YouTube example if possible so we can hear what your issue is. In general, you can find lots of help in Richard Miller\u2019s seminal work (and seminally priced) The Structure of Singing or in James McKinney\u2019s competitively priced (and sized) The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults. I would like to ask this: what is your purpose in singing in falsetto? Don\u2019t read anything into the question; I have no agenda for or against falsetto in asking it. I\u2019m simply curious as to how its use fits in your singing technic. If your technic is wrong, this may be what\u2019s breaking your falsetto. If you have otherwise good technic, your falsetto issues may indicate a physical deformity in the vocal ligaments themselves. You might need to have an otolaryngologist have a look at your cords to be sure they\u2019re smooth and uniform. ",
