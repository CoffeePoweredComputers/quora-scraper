            "answer_text": "People have to work out for themselves whether they want to put their faith in the theories of men that state certain events happened millions or billions of years ago. This faith, or religion, if you want to call faith a religion, known as scientism is a farce. These people claim that they do not exercise faith in their beliefs based upon this spurious knowledge of what they say happened eons ago, and of which there is no true scientific proof\u2014true science demonstrates how it is done in the now, without resorting to models of possibilities. In your case, you have to work out whether you are going to put your faith in these events that you describe actually occurring. Scoffers and doubters will not believe what you say or will attempt to rationalize a theory as to why you might be receiving these thoughts or hearing these voices. The reality is that only you know what you heard\u2014just do not tell a psychiatrist you are hearing voices. There is a television documentary series that analyzes the causes and circumstances that lead to disasters\u2014Seconds From Disaster. Regardless of the disaster that occurred, there were events that led up to what was an accident: a series of minor mishaps, little oversights, aspects of negligence, and unexpected circumstances; these all played their part. Analyzed, investigators are able to pinpoint how the disaster could have been prevented. If we were to analyze your situation as presented by you, we might be able to prevent you from becoming a Christian, so that you can remain with no hope. We can do this by finding out what is causing you to have these thoughts and making you susceptible to hearing these voices. Every atheist is very concerned right now that you might forsake the faith that revels in the rejection of God. You must not become a believer in the Creator God; especially that He loved the world so much that He gave His only begotten Son, so that you might believe that He has provided justice to the innocent, and hope to overcome the fear of the unknown at death, and verifies this by giving you the assurance of eternal life. It is when people start believing events (such as those that have been occurring in your life) to be true, they are likely to do something rash and call out to the Creator God (whom atheists believe does not exist). The problem with the events that you experienced is they lead to disaster (as far atheists are concerned) and you might read books written by the ex-atheist C. L. Lewis. If you read Miracles or The Screwtape Letters, this will be a tragedy to the Antichrist\u2019s community of anti-Creator believers; for you might start accepting the reality that a spiritual dimension exists that you cannot see, like the unseen words people speak of which you understand. Just to make sure you are not being caught out by confirmation bias, because you want to accept truth rather than deception, reject what is happening to you as real and reject the existence of death. People who start contemplating death and wondering about eternal life and the fact that they can conceive of it, start getting thoughts that God exists. The way of atheism rejects the idea of eternal life and any notion of a Creator. You must believe the lie that chance creates everything\u2014do not consider that the rule of chance defies that fact the Earth spins every day, the Moon circles the Earth every month, and together they both circuit the Sun every year, and have been doing this for eons. By the way, do not fall for ideas that people experience suffering, injustice, evil or any such thing. If these phenomena did exist, the Creator could not exist; because if He did, He would not allow it to occur. Do not read the Bible; neither anything that suggests there is a Creator who created the Universe with a purpose. Nor should you read anything that suggests the Creator gave some of His creatures freewill. If you do, you might get ideas that freewill enables evil to exist, especially if individuals within the Creation decided to reject the goodness of the Creator. Stick to the bias that says evolution will explain why man is unable to overcome evil. Most of all, have nothing to do with Christians, you might find that one of them is a very genuine person who loves you. Confirmation Bias Denies That Morality Is Real If It Is Absolute Because Sin\u2019s Dead ",

            "answer_text": "Without discounting the confirmation bias that others have mentioned, I would say that your initial experience is genuine. God wants you to get in touch with him. I tend to agree with Jared Busby\u2019s opinion. I also agree that bibliomancy is something to be careful about. On very rare occasions, opening the Bible at random sometimes gives you a valuable insight into a current problem. But to put this in perspective, over the course of my lifetime as a Christian, this has happened maybe 2 or 3 times in 50+ years. It is far better to do a thorough search of scripture on an issue than random openings of scripture. You\u2019re interested in miracles? Then do a word search for every instance where the word miracle is used, and then do follow-up with related instances in which the word miracle is not used but God\u2019s activity is obvious. One you will find is that Jesus himself tended to downplay his miracles. And maybe the word \u201cmiracle\u201d should be defined first. For me, a miracle does not violate God\u2019s laws, either physical or spiritual - but such laws can be transcended. By that I mean that we humans can\u2019t fly - but yet we can. We do it with the knowledge of how our atmosphere works, the application of physics. But we can never flap our arms fast enough to achieve flight ourselves. After your initial experience, I might tend to side with the more skeptical in saying you were already primed for those other things to happen. That said, something happened that first time. Enough to cause you to write on Quora about it. So my personal advice is: keep reading. But read in a more systematic way. The Lord wants you to get in touch with him. The spiritual life is a real thing. It cannot be measured with any known instruments, but that doesn\u2019t make it less real. For example, 100 years ago, a person would say that if he couldn\u2019t see it, hear it, feel it, taste it or smell it, it must not be real. But thoughts are real, and they were real then, even though thoughts don\u2019t fit the above criteria. Only now we have an EEG to measure brain activity - although we have yet to know what the specific thought is. You do not need to be trapped by science vs faith thinking. We humans tend to think in either/or possibilities when both or more may be true. Be open. Accept that you had a real experience. I think you know that you did. You have an analytical mind. That will help you in ascertaining when things don\u2019t sound right when your Christian friends or acquaintances say something. There are different parts of the Body of Christ. Accept your role in that. Do your own research. Walk your own path. But don\u2019t ignore what happened to you. ",
