            "answer_text": "Some good answers here, but there is a possibility that has not yet been mentioned. If it is a multi-speed turntable (33/45), with the speed controlled by a knob or lever, then the speed should change when you move the lever. If there is no change to the speed, then the belt has been incorrectly fitted. If you remove the platter, you will see that the lever operates a hook shaped device; it moves up and down as the lever is moved. The belt must pass between the forks of the hook shaped device, and around the small stepped pulley adjacent to it. Arrange the belt so it goes between the forks and around the small pulley before refitting the platter, then fit the loose end of the belt around the large pulley on the platter. The method of doing this varies; some turntables have a two-piece platter so that the belt can be positioned before the outer platter ring is fitted, others have holes through the platter to fit you finger through in order to fit the belt. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Your question suggests you are using a belt drive turntable. These usually have an arrangement to shift the belt up and down on to positions on the motor shaft to give 33 and 45 rpm. Is it possible that you have it set at 45 for a 33 rpm record. The other possible issues is that the frequency of mains power may be different to that designed for the motor. In the US the mains power frequency is 60 Hz whereas it is 50 Hz in much of the rest of the world. If you run a 50 Hz turntable in 60 Hz power it will run 20% too fast. ",
