            "answer_text": "Yes. Since COVID-19 is a virus, it has the ability to mutate rapidly. The strain in the US is different from the one in China, which is also different from the one in Italy.  It is possible we might be dealing with more than one virus, but two very similar ones. Back in late 2019, there were reports of a strange \u201cthing\u201d going around in the USA. Doctors thought it was some strain of the flu, but now when they compare the symptoms to COVID-19 it is alarmingly similar. I cannot confirm this, as this has yet to be backed up by science. However, we cannot dismiss the possibility that COVID-19 has been in America for far longer than previously thought. ",
