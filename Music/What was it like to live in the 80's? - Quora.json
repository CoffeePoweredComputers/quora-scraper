            "answer_text": "In my opinion it tends to be romanticized because of nostalgia and because it was the time of some peoples\u2019 youth, but it was still day to day life with many if not more problems, but there was fun and unique things about it as well. Despite many differences big and small I think that the 80\u2019s had a lot in common with life today in the 2010\u2019s. It was a lot like now only w/o social media, internet and gadgets.People did a lot of the same stuff like went to the movies or watched movies at home. Going to the video store was a different experience\u2026but that lasted well into the 2000\u2019s. People didn\u2019t have streaming like Netflix but could pay to get lots of extra channels on their color television sets (in addition to their basic cable which was about 12 channels) and watch popular movies on cable channels like HBO, Cinemax or Show-Time, Disney Channel, USA network etc.. People taped a lot of movies on their VCR\u2019s and would have libraries of movies that they taped from HBO or cable TV.I had a friend that had a whole library of movies his dad taped from HBO, he would have 3 movies per tape and he would let me borrow them sometimes. It looked just like this:  People listened to records & cassettes ( I know people still listen to vinyl now, but it\u2019s more of a retro culture, but throughout the entire 80\u2019s records were still pretty normal as the main way to listen to music even though cassettes and C.D.s had been invented ). I think 8 tracks phased out in the early 80\u2019s but they were still drifting around. Another similarity the 80\u2019s have with our current times is that people had \u201cportable music\u201d all throughout the 80\u2019s as the \u201cWalkman\u201d was invented in the late 70\u2019s and was very popular and widely available throughout the decade. Walkman - Wikipedia  Even portable disc players existed in the 80\u2019s, but I personally never saw any until the 90\u2019s.  Discman - Wikipedia At a price of $350 in 80\u2019s dollars, this was a lot, but they did exist and people did use them. Mostly one would see portable cassette tape players used by people wearing headphone as we do now, no wireless headphones though.   Though there has been some evolution, the music genres that still exist now had basically been established like rock, rap, punk, R&B, modern country, indie, metal, pop, dance pop, electronic. I remember the first time I encountered CDs and I thought that you had to be rich to have a CD player, this was in like 86 or something like that, but within about 5 years CD\u2019s had become very common. 1985 News Story on Debut of the Compact Disc (CD)  Sony Walkman commercial from 1981 & 1983   Here is a really good video I found on Youtube where L. Ariel gets into depth about how people listened to music in various ways (home stereo, boombox, walkmen etc..) in the 80\u2019s.  People wore a variety of styles but basically they would wear jeans, t-shirts, shorts, tank tops and sneakers or flip flops when dressed casual and ties and button up shirts, dresses, skirts, slacks, high heals when more formal as they do now. I remember a friend had these \u201cPony\u201d high top shoes in about 85/86 and they seemed really cool  Jean Jackets were fashionable. I remember in 1985 wanting a jean jacket like Marty McFly. A friend of mine had a Levis Jean Jacket that resembled this one.  \u201cJams\u201d, colorful shorts, and \u201cJellies\u201d colorful cheap plastic shoes were popular round about 86/87     There was slower flow of knowledge and information so people were not as worldly or informed, they lived more locally and regionally but there was still newspapers,national news publications like Time,Newsweek etc\u2026also the evening news with Dan Rather (on CBS),Tom Brokaw (on NBC) and Peter Jennings(ABC). There was basic cable TV that you would pay for which included about 12 channels and then also there was expanded packages that you could pay extra for which included MTV, Nickelodeon, USA network, ESPN sports channel, HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, CNN, Disney channel etc.. lots of other channels. If someone had a lower income and couldn\u2019t afford cable, or just didn\u2019t want it, they could still get PBS and like 2 or 3 local channels with an antennae.  Going to the movies was quite the same experience as today to most extents. Many could go to a multiplex theater in a mall, buy a ticket go to the concession stand that looked very similar to ones now and buy most of the same stuff (brands of candy, popcorn, pretzel, nachos, soda etc..). You\u2019d go sit in the theater that smelled like popcorn and wait for movie to come on, watch coming attractions and so on. In smaller cities like where I was from, before we had a mall multiplex theater, we had a Movie Theater in a shopping plaza that had 4, and then 8 screens after renovation, but eventually they were bought out when a mall with a multiplex came to the the area in the mid-later 80\u2019s. I\u2019d say that the sound dynamics of the audio and video have improved, there were more crackling sounds and I do not remember the audio being as rich, booming and surrounding as it is now. I remember the comfort and plushness of the movie seats was different then too, at least the theaters that I went to. In movie theaters nowadays that I have been to in the last 20 years, (unless it is an older theater) they seem to have made the seats more lavish and deluxe practically like a lazy boy chair! whereas back then they were usually more minimal fold down seats that automatically sprang back up when you\u2019d get up and had less cushion. I do remember once in the early 80\u2019s, maybe 1981, I saw Superman 2 and I remember people smoking in the theater, but after that I remember it being no-smoking throughout the rest of the 80\u2019s, usually before the coming attractions there would be a presentation or trailer reminding viewers to get candy at the concession stand and it would say \u201cThank You For Not Smoking\u201dHere is an example (this is the exact one that would play at my movie theater in Watertown NY around 86\u201389) :  Here is a clip from \u201cPolice Academy 2\u201d released 1985 (probably filmed in 1984). If you look at the products and the packaging and the basic setup of the supermarket you can see a lot of familiarity with today. Back then, of course, there was no \u201cself checkout\u201d but there were large supermarkets with bakeries, delis, snack bars, pharmacy and large selections that resemble the ones of today. In this clip it looks like a more modest sized supermarket, which one can still find nowadays (at least as of this edit: 4/6/2020)  The video game craze started in the earlier 80\u2019s and there would be arcade video games at restaurants, bars, supermarkets, convenience stores, bowling alleys, drugstores, movie theaters, cafe\u2019s, doughnut shops, you name it! There was arcade games everywhere. At county fairs there would be arcade game tents. It made such an impression on me at the time that in my mind I can still hear all the bleeping and blooping of those games in the game tent in the midst of the smell of fair food! Games like \u201cDonkey Kong\u201d, \u201cGalaga\u201d, \u201cMr. Do\u201d, \u201cStar Wars\u201d, \u201cPopeye\u201d, \u201cZaxxon\u201d, \u201cDefender\u201d, \u201cSpace Invaders\u201d, \u201cMs. Pac-Man\u201d, \u201cSpy Hunter\u201d, \u201cQ*Bert\u201d and many others were very popular. \u201cPac-Man\u201d was probably the most famous around 81/82. I loved the game and was well aware of it and I was I was only four and five years old. There was even a song, \u201cPac-Man Fever\u201d that was a hit during the phenomena.  There was much Pac-Man merchandise including a cartoon and a board game.  Usually the video games were 25 cents so quarters were pretty important coins to have available! I remember people would line their quarters up on the little ridge below the video game screen to signify that they were next up to play. At privately owned video arcades there\u2019d be a change machine that you would slide a dollar into and it would give you four tokens rather than quarters.  Here is some links to arcade footage from the 80\u2019s on youtube.   There was also movie, video rental service everywhere like in supermarkets, many times in local neighborhood stores there would be a small selection . A lot of Mom and pop video rental shops in the 80\u2019s. Those all seemed to diminish throughout the 90\u2019s as Blockbuster and larger companies came about. One difference I remember between renting videos In the 80\u2019s compared with renting them in the 90\u2019s was that in the 80\u2019s there often would be one or two copies of a given movie and you had to wait until it returned but in the 90\u2019s the stores would get many copies and line them all up on the wall.   It was kind of fun to go to a neighborhood corner market and rent some cheap 2$ movie when you were a kid in the summer with a friend. I remember all those really cheesy 80\u2019s horror movies and their VHS cover art.Here are some VHS covers I remember seeing a billion times on the video racks while browsing endlessly trying to decide which video to rent.       Here is a link to some articles that show 80\u2019s VHS cover art. Many of them I saw hundreds of times while scanning the aisles of movies. What is weird is that I never even watched many of them but the many VHS covers are vividly imprinted into my memory. The 100 Greatest VHS Horror Covers: Part I Here is a movie trailer for \u201cRunaway\u201d with Tom Selleck. This movie has a very 80\u2019s aesthetic, almost to the point where it seems like it could be a spoof!   The voice overs were more emotional, dramatic and intense. Listen to the voice over for this deliciously ridiculous early 80\u2019s \u201cFriday The Thirteenth\u201d rip-off horror slasher flick called \u201cThe Burning\u201d, I swear its intensity could induce a panic attack!  People spent a lot of time watching TV. A lot of channel flipping. A lot of reruns from the 50\u2019s through the 70\u2019s were aired and still influenced people even though they seemed out of date at the time.  WWF professional wrestling was very popular. Andre The Giant,Hulk Hogan,Macho Man Randy Savage, Junkyard Dog, Superfly Snooka, Rowdy Roddy Piper etc\u2026.This clip is hilarious! Andre the Giant turns on Hulk Hogan, it is so silly , but still entertaining. In the 80\u2019s people LOVED WWF pro-wrestling and really got into the drama.  Garbage Pail kids were a phenomenon worth mentioning. From around 85\u201388 there was a bit of a mania. People would collect Garbage Pail Kid cards and trade them and get in trouble for having them at school and marvel laugh about how disgusting they were. I think in the 80\u2019s sophomoric or off color humor was more prevalent than today. I think there was more of a jackass sense of humor than today, like a ridiculously vulgar, carefree, sophomoric humor that wouldn\u2019t go over as well today. I think humor in this time is a bit smarter which is good in ways but also can be a little too over serious, uptight or censorious in my view.Back then you could just laugh easier, but now it feels like one risks being called a moron, or cringey or embarrassing or offensive but back then one might pride themselves on being a dip-shit in the name of having a laugh. It seems like humor has changed to a degree to be less like that. To my observation the 90\u2019s humor became more sarcastic, biting, ironic, surreal and a bit darker but in the 80\u2019s it was a shade lighter & leaned more in the direction of low brow licentiousness in tone than it does now.Watch these guys (from Len Enders youtube channel, check it out, lots of 80\u2019s footage documented) fool around and act joyously vulgar. I remember people in my sphere having fun like this at that age. In this video people keep giving the middle finger when the camera is on them, I remember this was more common back then. People don\u2019t seem to give each other the finger as often, but in the 80\u2019s friends would always do it like jokingly or just when messing around, or on the school bus or if you took a picture or had a camcorder going someone would flip the bird like it was really funny. Another thing I remember is that folks back then weren\u2019t as used to being filmed or recorded as they are now (with all the smart phones nowadays) and would get a little more awkward or shy if there was someone going around filming with a camcorder. Being filmed made you feel like you were on TV and it was odd to see one\u2019s self from different angles on camera moving.  And here are a few Garbage Pail Kids Cards Garbage Pail Kids - Wikipedia     Baseball Cards were also very popular at the time   This Bill Ripken card caused a sensation because it was printed before the word \u201cF**K Face\u201d was noticed written on the base of his bat.   Action figures surged in popularity at that time, He-Man, Star Wars, Super Powers,GI Joe, Tranformers, Go-Bots, Wrestling Figures, Thundercats, and many many more.         People played Atari, Nintendo and Commodore 64 games on home computers.Here is Commodore 64 game I played a lot.  Here are some pictures of people with their Commodore 64\u2019s    So things were similar in many ways (for example went to the movies, watched movies at home, watched TV shows, watched cartoons, played video games, watched sports, wore jeans, sneakers, listened to rock, rap, metal, pop, read comic books, graphic novels, listened to portable music) but the differences were how it was accessed. Also you were not as connected as now since there are i-phones. You would use landline phones and everything seemed farther apart and not as immediately connected, like when you left home to go somewhere across town there was a different feel to the experience almost like the two spaces existed independently of each other, far away, and remote whereas now you can take a drive from one end of the continent to the other while video calling your family the entire ride. Back then there was expensive long distance phone calls and payphones with time limits (or you might ask to use someone\u2019s phone to make a brief call, like if you were at a friend or relative\u2019s house.) and no e-mail or instant messaging. I think this is a hard one to pinpoint but I feel like there has been a head change in the mindset in the way time, space and location are perceived since mobile/smart phones, internet, e-mail all came to prominence. Comics and superheroes were a part of pop culture then, and a big industry but not so much as they have been in recent years in the 2000\u2019s & 2010\u2019s with all the movies, video games and TV shows. Back then, by and large most adults would associate comics with with kids and kids only. Cartoons like \u201cSuper-Friends\u201d, \u201cSpider-Man and his Amazing Friends\u201d or the 1966 \u201cBatman\u201d reruns were in syndication and some other superhero cartoons or shows were on TV, but they were targeted more for kids. There was toys & merchandise around too. Teenagers and adults weren\u2019t as much aware or into comics or comic-book lore and didn\u2019t think much about them unless they were comic book collectors and readers which was more of a sub-culture than it is now. I think that the art of the graphic novel became popular in the 80\u2019s with Frank Miller\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Night Returns\u201d and that comic books were pushing to have darker and more complex themes.             Here is a link to a list of popular comic book covers from the 80\u2019s The 100 Greatest Comic Book Covers of the 1980s Many of the same things that are in the News today were in the news then like civil rights, middle east, immigration, unemployment, terrorism, wall street, gender relations . HIV/Aids was a much more salient and discussed issue than it is now because it was new and more deadly as there was less advances in treatment. LGBT rights were horribly violated and there was much gay bashing especially when AIDS became a national fear and people wrongly blamed gay people. There was some degree of tolerance & acceptance in the country among more liberal,educated & enlightened people and the gay rights movement was underway but for a significant portion of the general population the thought of someone being gay was considered something to either be joked about or an unspeakable topic that roused strong negative emotions. You didn\u2019t talk about it with your grandparents and to be gay was considered sinful and shameful to many people at the time especially more religious, conservative or culturally traditional leaning people, of which there were more than there are now. There was a lot of gay jokes in culture, in movies, comedy shows and just among people. It was also very common for people (usually younger people) to use pejorative gay slurs as insults toward each other on a fairly regular basis. In this sense things have changed significantly and for the better as LGBT has become more accepted with gay marriage rights and more acceptance in media and culture in general, back then though it was a much more volatile and taboo.There was more racial division and tension and a lot more racism that was tolerated and casually expressed by people. I\u2019d say there was a lot more outward aggression and instability demonstrated by people and that there were more fist fights and confrontational communication and behavior back then. I remember hearing parents tell their kids they were \u201cgonna get a lickin\u2019\u201d, meaning spanked, hit, smacked, beat or threatened with some sort of corporal punishment. I remember friends getting spanked and hearing them scream and cry and I also remember seeing kids smacked in grocery stores right in public and no one saying anything. I remember in 1983 in a neighborhood area where lots of kids would play after school, a mother came running out of the house with a paddle in her hand and was yelling at her kids, and other kids threatening to spank them. I remember once standing on the corner in front of where I lived and just waving a rope or a stick around, not with any intention to hurt anyone, just like in my own world and then suddenly a car pulled up and some lady I didn\u2019t even know got out of the car and scolded me and told me she was going to have her husband give me a spanking. I remember being at a friends house and the mother opened the refrigerator and there was a big chocolate bunny in there and I asked her if we could have a piece and she got very angry and told me that if I were her kid she would slap me for being so rude to ask. I remember that type of thing being more common than it seems to be now, especially in the earlier half of the 80\u2019s.People liked to fight more and brag about fighting and brag about being tough. People hit each other more, engaged in more rough play and were more physical with each other. A lot of unresolved emotional and psychological issues that hadn\u2019t been worked out in therapy and counseling, (which became more prominent in the 90\u2019s and 00\u2019s) were acted on in so many different ways.Though I can\u2019t say for sure, I am willing to bet that teachers are kinder and more humane now than they were in the 80\u2019s. I think back then that they were more stern, authoritarian and occasionally prone to violence if provoked. I remember in first grade a kid was insolent to a gym teacher and the enraged gym teacher picked the kid up off the floor by the collar and pinned him up against the wall and was swearing in the kids face. I remember a teacher who told a kid who kept talking that if he did not stop talking that he (the teacher) would rip the kids lips off. That is pretty severe now that I think of it! I remember teachers getting angry and throwing desks or screaming angrily at students, or absolutely humiliating them, doing things that I do not think they could get away with now. Teachers and adults were more authoritarian towards kids then than they are now. At the time I think things were changing and probably better than they had been in the previous decades, but they still hadn\u2019t changed to how they are now.There was a lot more cigarette smoking. The health and fitness culture and industry had come to prominence but there was still a lot of unhealthy habits. A lot of junk food, a lot of beer drinking and lots of cigarette smoking. It had turned the corner on awareness , like people knew it caused cancer and a lot of people were quitting but if you went back to any year in the 80\u2019s you would witness a lot more people smoking in a lot more places. I remember in seventh grade (88/89) a lot of kids smoked at the bus stop or on the corner across the street from school and it always smelled like cigarette smoke in the school restrooms.      Yes, the fitness health culture existed and running shoes were popular, aerobic shoes too. High tops were considered cool. I\u2019d guess that more people were exercising, jogging, going to aerobic classes and gym etc... than had gone in previous decades, but it was still more conspicuous to see joggers than it is now. Like if you see joggers now it is not that big of a deal but in the 80\u2019s a runner would be seen a bit more weirdly and probably get more yells and harassment, odd looks etc\u2026      Here is some earlier 80\u2019s running styles.  Here is some later 80\u2019s running styles.  you can tell the difference between the early 80\u2019s and late 80\u2019s workout clothes.  Here are some bodybuilders working out in a gym.  Some of the fitness/aerobic workouts could be silly and funny, but they could be good too and get a person in shape. This one is really funny though! lol!!  Sneakers became really popular and stylish for the first time in the 80\u2019sYou had Nike and Air Jordan\u2019s and all sorts of popular aerobic, running, basketball, soccer and other sports shoesThe Sneaker Boom of the 1980s People were more ignorant in many ways and less mindful, less informed. If a 20 year old time traveled and got stuck in the 80\u2019s, like say 1986, they would notice how much less instant and convenient things were and they would notice peculiarities in people\u2019s behavior but they would also see a lot of familiar things and wouldn\u2019t be absolutely confounded like Marty McFly was when he went back to the 50\u2019s.If a 20 year old from the 86 somehow got stranded in 2018 he would think smart phones and internet were amazing but I do not think he or she would lose their mind or be in a state of shocked horror and confusion, like they could adapt reasonably quickly.Going to the mall was a thing people did for leisure in the 80\u2019s, and it continued throughout the 90\u2019s. I\u2019m not sure how much people still go today, but I know that I never go to a mall anymore, and have only gone like twice in 12 years, but at that time mall culture was big. On weekends families or groups of friends would all go up to the mall and walk around and browse stores, shop, and visit video game arcade, go see a movie, eat in the food court, meet friends or maybe get into mischief. I think that has died down since the turn of the century\u2026going to the mall used to be more of a pastime than it is now I think.Here is a link with many photographs from everyday mall scenes from around the country.What American shopping malls looked like in 1989 Here is a 80\u2019s mall video  For movies you had E.T., Back To The Future, Star Wars trilogy, Pee Wees Big Adventure. In the 70\u2019s there had been Jaws and Close Encounters so it wasn\u2019t like living in the 50\u2019s or 60\u2019s in the pre-blockbuster period or when special effects were primitive and conspicuously fake. In the later 80\u2019s you had Aliens,Predator, Beetlejuice, Batman, Robocop, The Fly, Back To the Future 2 which all hold up pretty well still today. CGI hadn\u2019t revolutionized movies yet but when you watch many 80\u2019s movies they are still quite realistic (in terms of special effects), believable and modern. So in 2019 you watch a movie from 30+ years ago and you see \u201cAliens\u201d, but in 1989 if you watched a movie from \u201c30 years ago\u201d you would see \u201cPlan 9 from Outer Space\u201d. Plan 9 from Outer Space - Wikipedia  There was Saturday morning cartoons, that is something that has changed to my knowledge. Saturdays was cartoon day. In the mornings before school and then directly after school there was cartoons on also. * Also there was a lot of older cartoons in syndication (30\u2019s-70\u2019s) on every day like Loony tunes, Tom and Jerry, Pink Panther, Spider-Man 67, Rocket Robin Hood, Popeye, Hannah and Barbara, Scooby-Doo, Batman 66, in addition to cartoons of the time like Transformers, He- Man, Thundercats, GIJoe, Heathcliff. These shows were on regular cable channels, (meaning channels 2\u201312) in the morning before school and afternoon after school. Here are some examples of what TV was like on a Saturday morning. Here is an entire Saturday morning cartoons (broken into part 1 and part 2) on youtube, the first is ABC and the second is NBC. ABC 1981  NBC 1981  In the case of the Batman, the end credits has announcements for shows that would be on the next morning for the before school programming. The WNEW youtube link is also afternoon weekday cartoons.     Since TV stations usually were not 24 hours, at sign off (late at night) and sign on (early in the morning), they would play the national anthem and, in the case of late at night, sign off and then you would see color bars and hear a tone before the screen finally went snowy. I always thought it was kind of spooky but here is an example.  I lived close to Canada so I would get Canadian channels and they also would have sign offs and play the Canadian National Anthem. They would play this speciffic one where I lived.  In about 84/85, in 2nd & 3rd grade I used to walk a mile home in the deep snow in the winters of upstate NY with my friend. In addition to winter jackets and gloves we would wear snow pants and moon boots.   and watch Heathcliff after school at his house. I remember we would drink milk mixed with generic cola mixed with Hi-C. I know that is gross concoction but we were 8 and unsupervised, no parents around because they were at work. I\u2019m not sure if it is as common to leave kids unsupervised at that age as much now, but back then we kids were left unsupervised a lot.  There was good things about it but to be honest I\u2019d rather have been born 30 years later and grow up in this time period, or maybe in 100 years in the future. I think a lot of people look at that time with nostalgia and forget all the minutes,hours and days that were just blah bland blurry. A rainy day in 1985 was more depressing than one in 2018 because now a person has more to do indoors and can distract themselves with quora or netflix or surfing the web. Flipping through channels on a boring gray day in 1988 with weird random shows was depressing as heck. Although sometimes you could perchance upon a gem like on some random Saturday afternoon movie shown on WPIX or some local TV station that happened to be showing some weird movie or obscure cartoon that transfixed you and of which you have never seen since.Here are some examples of commercials and movies and TV shows back then\u2026Imagine sitting around on rainy days inside and being brain numbed by all these commercials. A good thing about the present day is that knowledge and mentally stimulating stuff is available on the internet but back in the 80\u2019s the TV was the main focus indoors and people were passively entertained and sort of in a state of trance-like passive waiting and in the meantime lots of commercials or impulsive channel switching. I think that it was more challenging to evade boredom in the 80\u2019s.   \u201cTales From The Darkside\u201d opening theme\u2026This opening with its spooky music was SO scary to me! I used to lift my legs up on to the couch cause I was afraid some monster hands would grab my feet from under the couch when this would come on!   This commercial brings me back. It was a popular commercial that you would see often and the jingle would get stuck in my head. \u201cSweet dreams are made of this, N-E-S-T-L-E-S\u201d  Snausages!, you\u2019d see this and then just go around laughing and saying \u201csnausages\u201d all day long, like the cartoon dog.  I remember \u201cCherry Coke\u201d came on the market in 1985 and this commercial was popular. I remember wanting to try \u201cCherry Coke\u201d, and still to this day the taste reminds me of that summer, which coincided with the release of \u201cBack To The Future\u201d   This video \u201cBody Rock\u201d by Maria Vidal is very representative of that 83\u201386 era in style/fashion.  \u201cBreak My Stride\u201d by Mathew Wilder  Here is the class of 1983 Watertown NY High school slideshow. I graduated from this high school in 1994, but I was searching Youtube and found this. If you watch it you can see the styles of clothing & hairstyles at the time (82/83), although there was regional variation and what people were wearing in a smaller city close to the Canadian border in northern New York wouldn\u2019t be exactly the same as what people in Venice Beach CA., or the Bronx or Denver Colorado. Also by about 1987/88 styles had noticeably changed, so this would represent earlier 80\u2019s. By this point the 70\u2019s styles were pretty much gone, at least for younger people who were more into the modern fashion. For the most part it was a no bell bottom zone by 1983.  Here is the CBS evening news that was on every weekday evening, Where I lived in Watertown N.Y. it was on WWNY TV 7 on channel 4 after the local news. Here is a whole episode that someone uploaded from maybe a VCR recording they made \u2026  I remember the day the Challenger tragedy, I was sick at home from school and the news stations all were covering the explosion, the whole country was in a state of horror .   Around the holidays there would be specials on like at 7 or 8 p.m. in place of regular programming , like the Peanuts Christmas special and this logo would always be shown and for some reason it would get you all excited and in anticipation of whatever was to be shown. If you were a kid then it was often times some cartoon animated special and you might get to stay up a little later and watch it before bed.  Here is an example from a video taped in the 70\u2019s, but it was still the same in the 80\u2019s (if you watch the whole video ignore the 70\u2019s commercial) you would see that logo and hear that little tag theme orchestration and then a pause, and then the Peanuts special would come on, with that Vince Guaraldi jazz piano Christmas music and then you knew it was officially Christmas time! Couldn\u2019t wait to get vacation from school!  Here is a news clip from a local news station about Christmas Toys for the 1981 holiday season.  Here are the cartoon openings from many popular shows that you would see.  Here are a whole bunch of commercials you would see watching TV  One thing that I fondly remember In 1982\u20131985 (when I was about 5\u20138) I would listen to little records or cassettes that came with read along booklets. They would have fairy tales or Disney cartoons or major movies like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, or The Dark Crystal. I remember bringing them to school and the teacher played one of them once for the whole class. The Dark Crystal  Return Of The Jedi  Peter and The Wolf  The cold war was still going and I remember worrying about nuclear war with the Soviet Union, although I do not know that we live in a less perilous world today really, but the cold war did weigh on peoples minds a great deal.If you didn\u2019t live in bigger cities there was usually more conformity and backwards thinking and you couldn\u2019t express yourself to the extent that you can now or you would risk being harassed, bullied or shunned, but not always.One thing that was different is that you wouldn\u2019t see people with hair dyed unconventional colors very often unless you lived in a bigger city. Also not as many people had tattoos. In the mid-later 80\u2019s more radical personal self expression started to get more popular, accessible by more people like spike haircuts, or having a \u201ctail\u201d (which I had in 1985)  I\u2019m not saying there was never any more flamboyant personal fashion, there was, and especially in larger cities and cultural centers like New York City or L.A., but usually more for people who were associated sub cultures (like metal heads, bikers, punks, people in rock bands etc..) but I think it is safe to say that overall more people generally were conforming to mainstream norms in their clothing and styles. Basically you wouldn\u2019t see as many people being so publicly & openly self expressive in their styles and when you did it would be more noticed. People overall dressed more within a safe zone associated with their socioeconomic class, whereas now you can see a greater social tolerance for a broader spectrum of personal freedom in self expression, like now upper middle class teens, young adults get tattoos and piercings (tongue rings etc.) but back then that would be much more rare.In the 90\u2019s this changed a lot. Many people started coloring their hair, wearing more piercings, getting tattoos, dying their hair, more people started thrift shopping for style, but in the 80\u2019s not as much. Another thing different between now (as of September 2019) is that regional accents and cultural idiosyncrasies were more pronounced. Though the process of corporations and media creating more homogeneity had begun there wasn\u2019t as much as there is today and different places still maintained more of their regional character. There were McDonald\u2019s & corporate chains and fashions that were widespread and common throughout the country but not as much as now. Nowadays & in the last 20 years or so you can go from one city to the next and see the exact same stores, plazas, outlets, corporate franchises, so that if you drive across the country it can sort of be perceived like one big seamless strip mall, or seem like a Target or Wal-Mart every 30 miles, but in the 80\u2019s there was still more subtle & obvious regional diversity in terms of style and accent. Now everyone is doing a lot of the same things (social media,internet) and communicating instantly all over the world & country and seeing a lot of the same media. Local character nuance seems to be fading out and not as striking as back then. There was more outside play but it had already begun to diminish since TV and video games had become popular, but overall there was more going outside to play and more walking to places. And I\u2019d say kids walked a lot more and had less supervision. Another difference between now and then that I think is accurate to say is that more people were religious, attended church on Sundays or at least actually believed in God even if they weren\u2019t regular church goers. I think if you interviewed one million random people from the U.S. in 1985 and asked if they were religious,attended church or believed in God, that the percent would be much higher than if you did a similar survey today. I think today that many more people are not religious and are agnostic or atheist. In the 80\u2019s at official public events it was often spoken as though it were given that God was definitely real and people would ponder or reflect or talk about \u201cGod\u201d, and as I said, even people who weren\u2019t necessarily religious church goers. Although there are still many people of faith, It doesn\u2019t seem so much as it used to be anymore and there is, in general, a reduced concern or stigma around atheism. One thing about the 80\u2019s that doesn\u2019t seem to be talked about much was that there was still many holdovers and echos from the 70\u2019s that you could see and it was very noticeable because the 80\u2019s were quite different in many ways from the seventies. In the early 80\u2019s you could still see plenty of big 70\u2019s cars which were a conspicuous contrast to the smaller boxier 80\u2019s cars. You could also see a fair amount of people who still had bell bottoms, or had not kept up with the fashion, or just hadn\u2019t bought new clothes in a few years. Usually it might be an older person, or a person unconcerned with styles, or it might be a person of lesser means who wore hand-me down or thrift shop clothes that may have only been 10 years old but already looked very dated. If one thinks about it, a lot of clothes from 2009 or even 1999, (and actually even 1989!) could pass in 2019, but in 1986 a pair of pants that was just 7 years old could look very out of style and was really noticeable. I thought bell bottoms were horrible and all styles from the seventies were utterly embarrassing at the time, all pants had to be straight leg and meet with the sneaker with a nice taper, sort of like how Marty McFly\u2019s jeans pant leg met his Nikes in \u201cBack To The Future\u201d, no flair was tolerated. Also you could still see many kitchens , living rooms that still had 70\u2019s design, especially if you went to an older person\u2019s house (sometimes even older than 70\u2019s, like 60\u2019s or even 50\u2019s!), but so much changed in 10 years from 1975 to 1985, and many were not so quick to remodel their kitchens or replace their carpets, tiles, furniture or replace refrigerators, so you could still see much orange, gold, brown & avocado color patterns leftover from the 70\u2019s. On TV either reruns from the 70\u2019s or shows that started in the 70\u2019s would still be on and you could see a stunning contrast in the styles between an early season episode of \u201cDifferent Strokes\u201d or \u201cThree\u2019s Company\u201d from the late 70\u2019s and the newer ones showing in 83\u201385. By the late 80\u2019s most of the 70\u2019s echo was gone but you could still find traces of it if you looked especially in people\u2019s homes.I think there was more listening to the radio and American top 40 on Sundays with Casey Kasem or Shadow Stevens. Top forty music played everywhere and certain songs were ubiquitous and seemed to soak in to one\u2019s consciousness over the years without even trying.Here is a Spotify playlist that I made that contains songs that I remember hearing constantly on the radio, always on in the background wherever I seemed to be. When I hear these tunes it reminds me of those times. gray days on 80's radio, a playlist by Corey James Wiley on Spotify ***Here is a better playlist of popular 80\u2019s songs, the first one I linked to was some songs I liked and others that I didn\u2019t, but still heard a gazillion times. Here is another playlist of popular 80\u2019s songs that has more songs and includes ones that I think are the better songs. 80's - Some popular 80's songs, a playlist by Corey James Wiley on Spotify I sometimes can be nostalgic for the time and in my mind revisit and feel sentimental, and I can hardly believe that it was so long ago now (30 plus years! whoa!), because a lot of the memories of existing then seem, to use a common clich\u00e9, just like yesterday, but I can\u2019t agree that it was better in the 80\u2019s like some people claim or how others idealize it. There are a few things that may have been better in the past. Maybe there was a little less self consciousness, a bit more innocence of some kind, an ability to laugh easier and more heartily, perhaps more room to make mistakes and then move on, maybe a bit of a broader scope or at least a different mosaic of emotional expressions that allow a person to experience some things that are different from now\u2026but maybe not, It is hard to pinpoint exactly because so many things were the same yet at the same time there have been changes too. Things that people can get more of now thanks to greater awareness like understanding, acceptance and compassion for bullying, depression & other mental health issues, being awkward or \u201cnerdy\u201d, or (as previously mentioned) gay or outside the norm in other ways\u2026for those things there was less understanding and more people suffered because of it. It seems like superficiality, fitting in and being cliquey (though still things that exist now) in the 80\u2019s were, by at least to a degree more prevalent. I think it would be fun to visit 80\u2019s, and though there would still be plenty of familiarity, it\u2019d also be interesting and a change to experience the differences, observe the contrasts and perhaps loosen up in ways that may be harder to do now, but all and all I believe that it is better to live now. Today there is more access to things to self cultivate, to enjoy leisure time, there is more awareness, people have grown and evolved in numerous ways, though society clearly still has a ways to go toward higher potentials. Possibly someone in 2040 will wonder what it is like to live in the 00\u2019s or 10\u2019s, but then they will have a lot more material to observe since now we have so much social media and cameras and youtube etc.. In the 80\u2019s, there was camcorders but many people did not own them and those who did were not as prolific in their recording of everyday life as people are now.Overall I\u2019d say it is better to live now in the late 2010\u2019s (and now 2020\u2019s) than it was in the 80\u2019s despite all the problems that we still have and despite the sentimental and nostalgic feelings that images, music and styles from the time do effectively conjure. Extra: Here are some videos from Len Ender\u2019s Youtube channel. Shown in the video is footage in a convenience store, record store, video rental store, and McDonald\u2019s drive-thru in 1988.   ",

            "answer_text": "I started the \u201980s when I was 10 years old, so I can only talk about what it was like as a kid, and young adult. I agree a lot with Gerasimos Melissaratos \u2018s answer to How much better was life in the 80s or 90s than it is today?, that things happened more slowly than today. You had to be more patient, and work harder to get what you wanted done than you do now. It was quite a bit harder to get information than it is now. The normal practice was to go to a library, but a library wouldn\u2019t have everything you needed or wanted. There was interlibrary loan, but you had to wait to get those things. If what you wanted was reference material, you could only read it at the library. You couldn\u2019t take it home. While there were proprietary online services around, like CompuServe, they cost more, and were less convenient to use (though France had an online service, called Minitel, offered through their phone company, which was rather like America Online was for information). In non-constant dollars, computers cost about the same as they do now, but they were a lot less powerful (though, if you account for inflation, they cost more than they do now). Some things that I can say were qualitatively better, in terms \u201cwhat life was like,\u201d were: I didn\u2019t have to have my mom with me everywhere I went (I lived with a single parent). I hear what the regulations on parenting and kids\u2019 activities are now, and I feel like we\u2019ve gone through the looking glass into bizzaro-land as a society. As long as I told my mom where I was going to be, I could go where I wanted, by myself, or with friends around my age. I frequently walked or biked a mile from home to school, and back again, or I\u2019d go about a mile from school to the local library, after school, and then a mile home. On the weekends, I\u2019d walk a few blocks to a half-mile to some stores I liked to visit, just to see what they had. I\u2019d get together with friends to play basketball, with no adult supervision. That sense of independence was and is really valuable to me. It\u2019s part of what made me who I am. I believe it\u2019s Lenore Skenazy who\u2019s come up with the notion of \u201cfree-range kids,\u201d which is now controversial. When I was growing up, the method of raising kids she\u2019s described was normal! Did I run into weird people who could have posed a danger to me? Yes. Wherever I went, if there were adults around, there were some who I could report a troublesome person to if they actually posed imminent danger to me. We were armed with some knowledge about adults who would try to take advantage of us, such as driving up in a car or van, and offering us candy, or asking us to help them find their \u201clost puppy,\u201d or whatnot. We understood what to do in those cases (ie. don\u2019t approach them. Get a trusted adult involved, or just run away). IMO that worked pretty well.As others have said, the Dollar went farther. Even though my mom didn\u2019t make much money, we could live comfortably (in a modest dwelling, like a one-bedroom apartment, or two-bedroom duplex, or triplex) in a wealthy community, and I could go to decent schools where I could learn something sometimes. In the early \u201890s, she had to move out of the city where I grew up. She would not have been able to raise me there, if given the same circumstances, because the cost of living got too high.Schools could, and did, discipline kids for being disruptive. I never saw anyone get the paddle (I don\u2019t think it was even an option where I went to school), but teachers could restrain students if they got physically out of control. They could send them to the principal\u2019s office, and we had detention, along with suspension and expulsion. Teachers were expected to be respected, and the parents agreed with that.I know I\u2019m speaking for others on this one, not my own experience, but I\u2019ve heard enough from educators to think this was a good idea. Students who had English as a second language were expected to learn and speak English in class. English immersion was the standard policy, though there were ESL resources and classes to help students learn English, if they needed extra help. I\u2019m left with the impression that this notion is controversial now, but I think it was a better policy, because students from other countries, who were going to be here long-term, perhaps becoming citizens, were going to be better off, in terms of being able to get things done, and advance themselves in our society, if they could speak the language. As anyone who values learning knows, the fastest way to learn something is to expose yourself to the society that uses that knowledge regularly, as much as possible, including using a language. For example, if you want to become a fluent speaker of Spanish, forget about language lessons, in school or out of school. Go live in a place where the people speak Spanish as part of their normal everyday lives. That\u2019s the best way to do it. It\u2019s rough, but you will learn it, and much more quickly than taking language classes.",
