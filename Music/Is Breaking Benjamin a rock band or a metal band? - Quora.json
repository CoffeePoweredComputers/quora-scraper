            "answer_text": "I'd have to say they're sort of on the line between hard rock and metal. They certainly have some heavier songs, and for that, they can't really be called exclusively hard rock. But on the flip side, not all of their songs would be called metal so they can't be exclusively metal either. I guess they could fall into the alternative metal category, but I really don't like to pigeonhole bands into all the different genres and sub-genres. I like several of their songs and I've seen them live opening for Disturbed, a decidedly metal band (great show BTW), and they were heavy enough to have a mosh pit. Suffice to say, they're a good band worth giving a listen to if you've never heard their music\u2026and you can decide for yourself what type of band they are. ",
