            "answer_text": "Queen wins my vote as the group whose music I prefer to listen to. I give The Beatles all due respect for their brilliance and cultural impact but I was more influenced by Queen. I was a child / teen between the heydays of the Beatles and Queen. Just 7 years old when the Beatles broke up, I don\u2019t own a single record, but I know their music because it was constantly played on the radio. I knew nothing of albums \u2014 just singles \u2014 with Yellow Submarine and Penny Lane being the most familiar to me after all these years. There were movies, a kids cartoon, promotional items, etc. After they disbanded, and with John and George gone, their music continued to live on in television and film, and in advertising/ marketing. I did buy John\u2019s Double Fantasy many years after its release. I was older (yet just a tween) when Paul McCartney & Wings became popular. I liked them but I never owned an album or single. They, like the Beatles, were all over the radio but I think their appeal was more with the pop music audience. Queen came along about the same time. There was something raw about Queen that made me take notice. I can only remember seeing them on TV once \u2014 the Killer Queen performance from Top of the Pops \u2014 and being captivated by Freddie Mercury\u2019s appearance, voice and those lyrics. Again, I was very young but musical \u2014 I had been playing instruments since age 5, and I was in my school chorus and band at the time. Throughout my teens, Queen\u2019s hits had massive radio airplay. You\u2019re My Best Friend, We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions, Fat Bottomed Girls, Bicycle Race, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, Another One Bites the Dust, and Under Pressure came out during my high school and college years and I was won over by Queen again. At that point, I never owned a Queen record, never went to a concert, and didn\u2019t even see them on Live Aid because I was at work! And then, (in the US, anyway) they disappeared. POUF! Little did I know that they were still making great music and performing to sellout crowds in other parts of the world. It wasn\u2019t until years after Freddie\u2019s death that I bought my first Queen album. I don\u2019t even know why I bought it. It wasn\u2019t Wayne\u2019s World \u2014 I never saw the movie. That\u2019s when I became aware of the breadth and depth of their music. I was also fascinated with them as individuals \u2014 being musically talented and highly educated. Since I saw the film Bohemian Rhapsody in December 2018, I have been listening to Queen\u2019s album tracks, including their later music \u2014 particularly The Miracle, Innuendo, and Made In Heaven \u2014 and I love it all. I don\u2019t feel the same way about The Beatles. I like them but I really love Queen. ",

            "answer_text": "Me being a Queen fan has no influence on my answer to this question. Both bands have their own pros compared to each other. My opinion is, of course, subjective, but I\u2019ll try to answer as objective as I can. Overall, The Beatles is definitely the world\u2019s unbeatable. The band\u2019s longevity and influence may never be reached by any other 20th century song artist, and probably even by today\u2019s artists. They didn\u2019t just change rock-and-roll \u2014 they revolutionised it. Queen was no doubt one of the legendary bands who emerged under the inspiration of the Beatles, but they had their own iconic sound and largely contributed to the music world. I\u2019ll start with The Beatles\u2019 pros other than the ones I mentioned above. Until today, their popularity has remained quite consistent. It may have decreased a bit compared to the 20th century after Lennon\u2019s death and due to the music trend now. But that doesn\u2019t affect the band\u2019s legacy. On the other hand, Queen has its ups and downs. They celebrated their peak glory after Bohemian Rhapsody was released and being the best performance at Live Aid 1985 (and maybe their last concert appearance with Mercury at Wembley, 1986). Then, their popularity decreased with AIDS slowly killing Mercury. After Mercury died, Queen was silent for several years until they came back to performing without Deacon. Their popularity began to rise again, and they may be more popular than the Beatles now after the production of the film Bohemian Rhapsody. The film was a huge success and touched many young hearts, unlike the film Yesterday that featured the Beatles (but the film may be successful if it focused more on the band\u2019s own story like Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman did). Still, the Beatles\u2019 longevity is obviously longer than Queen\u2019s. Queen would probably be more popular today if Deacon was still in the band. Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing we can do about his pain in uniting with the band without Mercury. The Beatles are also more significant in their overall band performance. Both Lennon and Mercury died, but why were the Beatles still much more popular than Queen (before the film)? Because Mercury was Queen\u2019s cream-of-the-crop and so the band isn\u2019t as god-tier now as it used to be with him (don\u2019t get me wrong, Lambert is great, but no one can reach Mercury\u2019s level). Although Brian May and Roger Taylor were there first (in Smile), Mercury was the main pioneer of Queen. Meanwhile, I think all the members of the Beatles were nearly equally talented and influential, and their music thrived even when it\u2019s just McCartney who sang, for instance. A major difference between the two bands is that the music is the most important element for the Beatles, while it\u2019s the voice for Queen (their music also plays an important part, but Mercury\u2019s, May\u2019s and Taylor\u2019s voices stand out more). Sure, the most well-known member of Queen besides Mercury is the guitarist Brian May (a legend and great songwriter, but not the only guitar legend), but Taylor and Deacon won\u2019t be as legendary and popular if Mercury wasn\u2019t with them (they\u2019re great musicians, but not legendary). On another note, if we compare Mercury as an individual with the members of the Beatles, Mercury beats them by a landslide. He\u2019s the best singer (in terms of pure talent, brilliant songwriting and his very unique voice) and frontman of all time, and he just keeps getting more legendary after his death. His music ranges farther than anyone else could possibly achieve. He even did an opera duet album, Barcelona, with the famous soprano Montserrat Caballe (pls look that album up, it\u2019s extremely underrated). So yes, Mercury performing alone may make him a giant compared to the Beatles, but that doesn\u2019t account for Queen\u2019s overall team performance. Also, Mercury isn\u2019t Mercury without the band, and vice versa (Mercury\u2019s solo pieces are obviously not as famous as Queen\u2019s). Now, I\u2019m noting down Queen\u2019s pros regarding their persistency and unity. Both The Beatles and Queen never gave up on sharing their music to the world and continue to do so to this day. But let\u2019s remember that Queen never broke up like The Beatles have ever done, and that all the members made maximum use of the remaining time they had with Mercury by persistently making music together until Mercury\u2019s death. Don\u2019t forget that Mercury was also an immigrant and openly bisexual way before LGBTQ+ was legalised, and that never changed the brotherhood he had with the other members. The relationship and story of the members was probably one of the strongest ever witnessed. Besides that, even though the Beatles ignited the evolution of rock-and-roll, I think Queen has a stronger unique sound and style, shown by their unforgettable songs. I\u2019m not just talking about Bohemian Rhapsody; there are other underrated songs that have the similar style, such as March of the Black Queen, Millionaire Waltz, The Miracle and Innuendo. Of course, they have other famous songs including those featured in the film. Again, the Beatles may have more well-known songs than Queen, but I think (from the 100+ Queen songs I know) there are so many underrated Queen songs that deserve attention. In addition, Queen may be the band that involves the most audience participation in concerts because of Mercury (his main instrument is the crowd), and May was also able to lead the crowd with his guitar in some concerts and especially with the song We Will Rock You that he wrote. Queen surpasses The Beatles in terms of raw singing talent (as I\u2019ve said, for Mercury, May and Taylor). In conclusion, the Beatles have more significant pros than Queen. Nevertheless, I think it\u2019s safe to say that Queen is a pretty close second. I\u2019m a Queen fan because of my personal experience. My music tastes prefer its style rather than the Beatles\u2019 style and I prefer Queen\u2019s story of developing into one of the most legendary bands ever witnessed. Longevity is an important factor in music, but it doesn\u2019t appeal to me as much as music style. It\u2019s not Queen\u2019s fault for establishing themselves later than the Beatles. Tbh, my POV is that if Queen and The Beatles started at the same time (in an alternate universe), they would revolutionise rock-and-roll together. To end my opinion, I just wanna tell you that The Beatles and Queen are 2 different bands with different identities, so it\u2019s impossible to make an absolute comparison between them. Also, you don\u2019t have to be a fan of the best bands in the world \u2014 in fact, there\u2019s no perfect song artist. Just a reminder that I tried to make my opinion as objective as I can even though it\u2019s still subjective, and everyone has their own preferences. ",
