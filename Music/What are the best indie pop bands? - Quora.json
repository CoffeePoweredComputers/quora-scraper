            "answer_text": "The best indie pop leaves me wondering how on Earth they didn't get onto the radio. Some great, underrecognized acts: The Generationals, Ruby Coast, and The Limousines. Some bigger names are: MGMT, Vampire Weekend, Stars, Phoenix, Of Montreal, Beulah, Ted Leo & The Pharmacists, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Los Campesinos, The Apples in Stereo, YACHT, Tune-Yards, The Black Kids, Passion Pit I think the golden days of indie pop are behind us, but some new acts -- like Misun -- are promising to carry the genre forward. Enjoy!  ",

            "answer_text": "Incredibly hard to choose as there are so many good ones. I think my list would have to include Alvvays, Stars, Vampire Weekend, and last but surely not least The Shins. Alvvays has such a great jangle pop sound and retro aesthetic. It\u2019s really hard to beat the first few Shins records from an indie pop songwriting perspective and such great, unique vocals. Vampire Weekend is probably the most consistent indie pop band ever. Every record of theirs is great. Stars is special to me for multiple reasons and I think their specific mixture of indie pop and electronic genres is rather unique and interesting. ",
