            "answer_text": "Really good question! I am the queen of worry and anxiety, and I run into those days where it definitely rules the day. The first suggestion I have is to accept it is an \u201coff\u201d day, don\u2019t try to \u201cfake it\u201d or ignore it. Just accept it. \u201cOk, today sucks.\u201d Second suggestion, don\u2019t judge yourself for it; be gentle. \u201cOk, today is an off day. So what, it is what it is, everyone has one.\u201d Third..Let those close to you - spouse, partner, friends, etc. - know that you are struggling. This allows them the chance to be supportive so you have that extra encouragement and gentleness and it also clues them in to any atypical behavior or reactions you may have. Fourth\u2026go easy on yourself. Avoid major decisions or dealing with things that may suffer from you not being in the best place. On days when I am really fighting with anxiety, my partner knows not to come home from work and start a conversation about how our savings account isn\u2019t looking like we would like it to, or wanting to have a conversation about our relationship, because it just won\u2019t go well. It is hard to have a rational, logical discussion or to make the best decisions when your head isn\u2019t in the best place. Give yourself permission to \u201cscreen\u201d your day. Fifth\u2026.mindfulness, mindfulness, mindfulness. On those bad days, given the room, my brain is my worst enemy. When the feelings aren\u2019t great, the thoughts go in directions that are not helpful, so I try to be really conscious of what my brain is doing and where it is going, and catch myself when those thoughts go in directions they don\u2019t need to be. I talk to myself and rationalize out why I don\u2019t need to be going down that road, or I remind myself that it is an off day and backpedal from wherever I am going or sometimes it is just an outright \u201cStop it\u201d. And I move on. Really pay attention to where your brain is, and remind yourself, gently that today is an off day and I am just not going there today. Sixth\u2026listen to music you like, put on clothes that are comfy, take a bath\u2026whatever makes you feel calm, safe, comforted or happy. be gentle. On those bad days, I let myself lay in bed when I get home and just play with the dogs and listen to music or watch a movie. I don\u2019t try to be superwoman, I let house projects or chores, all of those \u201c I really should be\u2026.\u201d things wait and I just take some time to just \u201cbe.\u201d Seventh\u2026.I have found it really helpful to use what is a typical 12 step tool: HALT= Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. These often lead to even more off kilter emotional and mental states, so especially on bad days (though I uses it often outside of bad days) I make sure to check-in with myself in those moments when it feels like there is an escalation going on - am I hungry/angry/lonely/tired. If I am, hungry, lets say. Then I can tell myself \u201cok, hold on. I am hungry, that is contributing to this, let me eat and see where I am after that.\u201d or \u201c I am really tired, ok that is more than likely contributing to how I am feeling, so I will go home, relax, not answer the phone, go to bed early and reevaluate things tomorrow.\u201d Things like that. I really find it helpful. I think the main things are to accept it as it is rather than fighting it, reminding yourself it will pass, and taking care of yourself; being gentle; giving yourself permission to have a bad day without it meaning the universe is caving in and you are a horrible person. Sometimes, it is just about breathing in and out, all day long, and that is just the way it is. Hang in there!! ",

            "answer_text": "How to prepare for bad mental health days  1. Practice self care Practicing self care as often as possible, even when you don\u2019t feel like it, can help to make your bad mental health days more manageable and even less frequent. Pushing yourself and not taking enough time to look after yourself can lead to more severe or more frequent bad mental health days. It\u2019s important to look after your mental health all the time, not just when you are experiencing illness. Self care might include assigning some time to yourself just to relax or do something you enjoy, getting a change of scenery by going to visit family or friends in a different area, doing exercise or reading a book. 2. Build resilience Resilience is the ability to overcome challenges, adapt, and keep going after something difficult has happened in your life. It\u2019s not a fixed trait - it is something that is constantly learned and developed. Building resilience will help you to manage better on days when you are feeling bad. 3. Eat nutritious meals On a bad mental health day you might not feel up to preparing a proper meal but eating well is good for both your mental and physical health. Try to plan ahead and do some bulk-cooking so that you always have something to grab. Freeze a nutritious meal in a lunch box and keep it for a day you really need it. It\u2019s much easier to feel good when your stomach is full than when you are hungry. Have a look at our healthy eating section for some ideas. Eating nutritious food is important for your mental health so don\u2019t underestimate it. 4. Know what you can manage Recognise what you can and can\u2019t do on your bad mental health days. Pushing yourself to continue with your day like normal can sometimes make things worse, particularly if you are experiencing a mental illness. It\u2019s okay to cancel plans or reschedule things if you need to. Be honest with your friends about how you are feeling. If you have a college or work commitment and feel that you aren\u2019t up to it you could try talking to your lecturer or finding out about your sick day entitlements from work. If you have family commitments, find out if you can get a relative or family friend to help. If there are commitments you can\u2019t avoid, do your best to get through them and allow yourself the time and space to de-stress afterwards. 5. Getting through the day Be nice to yourself. Accept that you might not be as productive as usual, and treat yourself to something nice for lunch or as a snack. Do whatever you can to make your day a little easier. Tell a friend or colleague that you aren\u2019t feeling great if you think that will help. If a manager or lecturer is expecting too much of you, try to explain to them that you are not feeling yourself today, but you\u2019re doing your best. If you feel you are struggling with work because of a mental health issue, consider talking to a trusted person, perhaps a trusted colleague about how you feel. 6. Have a routine Having a routine every day, on both good and bad days, can help bring regularity to your day. If you wake up feeling down and are struggling to motivate yourself, having that structure in place might help you start your day without having to think too much about it. A routine can really helpful even if, on some days, you don\u2019t feel like it. Having a routine can also mean that you are more likely to get enough sleep. Getting enough sleep and having good sleep habits is essential in looking after your mental health. These 5 steps reveal the things you absolutely MUST AVOID if you want to look younger, to boost your immunity, reclaim your health, and achieve your ideal bod ",
