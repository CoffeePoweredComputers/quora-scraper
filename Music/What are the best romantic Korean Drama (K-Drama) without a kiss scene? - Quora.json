            "answer_text": "There are very few romantic Korean Dramas without kiss scene (I\u2019m assuming that your \u2018kiss\u2019 means lip kiss, not cheek kiss or forehead kiss). Basically romance includes intimacy including kiss, peck, hug, piggyback, cuddle, etc. You\u2019ll find many dramas of genre other than romance (like thriller, mystery, horror, etc.) without any kiss scene. Best romantic Korean Drama (K-Drama) without a kiss scene: Mr Sunshine - I was amazed by the acting of leads in this serial. Eyes can express so much without words. This serial also has everything. I loved story-line, cinematography, music, songs, etc. Moreover, this one has historical essence. This one has the stronger female lead, even stronger than the male lead. This one also portrayed social class difference of that era. Scenes were too beautiful. I never liked Lee Byung-hun for some reason I don\u2019t know, but this time I fall for his eyes.    2. My Mister - This is an unusual romantic drama without any romantic scenes. This serial portrays platonic love. This is a healing drama of two lost souls healing each other. Real emotions are portrayed by all actors. Viewers will not be amazed with the beauty of the drama, but they will be mesmerized by the aura of the drama. There isn\u2019t a single bit of unrealistic things. You will love the platonic chemistry between the leads. This serial is both heart-wrenching & heart-warming. The heroine is very unique a she isn\u2019t fragile like other heroine. She is one of the strongest heroine I have ever seen. This drama isn\u2019t of romantic genre, but I felt it romantic, So I\u2019m including this one.     3. Tree of heaven - When I read the story-line, I felt weird about it. But after watching this one, my views changed. This serial made me see what they wanted me to see. This is not so famous, but it's my top 10. I loved the innocence of the leads. (And Lee Wan became dream-man of all time of KDRAMA)     4. Terius Behind Me: This one is a funny mystery drama with little romance and too much bromance.     5. One Sunny Day - This is another cute mini web-drama.     Drama Specials: 1. You are Closer than I think  ",

I don't even imagine a K-Drama without LOVE! I mean that in allmost all Korean dramas there are basic things: a boy and a girl (of course there might be more but these are in allmost all dramas). So boy+girl=love right? And love=hugs and kisses ( \u02d8 \u00b3\u02d8)\u2665 lol I'm sorry if I destroyed your hope to search for K-Dramas without a kissing scene :( Anyways Im not into any Korean dramas so I can't give you any opinion about these dramas :( :( :( :( Sorry, but I hope you will find what you wanted to :D ",
