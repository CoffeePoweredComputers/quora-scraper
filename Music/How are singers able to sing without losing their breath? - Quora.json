            "answer_text": "Because they use the transversus abdominis (corset muscle) to pace the exhale of their breath. This is where a lot of singers go wrong. The diaphragm is important for your INHALE but the corset muscle controls your EXHALE. Here\u2019s a way you to try and feel it working. Take a breath in and then let out a hiss sound (sounds like air hissing out of a balloon). Keep going with that sound for as long as you can. While you are hissing out, you might notice your waist and the middle of your body coming in. If you have ever worn a corset, it feels a bit like someone is pulling the strings and the corset is gently tightening around your body. That is the corset muscle. Next, try and sing a note to an \u2018ee\u2019 vowel. Choose a note that\u2019s very comfortable for you. Then start singing the note while gently bringing in the corset muscle to help pace your breathing. Try this a few times and see if it can improve how long you can sing for in one breath. ",

Training. Lots of it. Endurance. Early in my music career when I was just a kid, I got a gig playing keyboards at a private club that was open 24/7. It was in an old converted Kmart store and had a half dozen stages scattered around. Non-stop live music. I was one of the acts. I would have to play 40 minute sets, with two hour breaks. I'd be there for 12-15 hours sometimes, napping & playing. It was the closest thing to musical torture I ever endured. It was a true blessing because the experience gave me Olympic endurance and taught me how to keep playing even when I couldn't even feel my hands anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "I come from the perspective of western classical singing where I was taught the goals of \u201cefficient phonation\u201d and \u201cresonance.\u201d Said in not so fancy language, the goal most of the time is to sing in such a way that not much breath is expelled. Many singers may think that singing needs a lot of air, and they may try to make a big sound by pushing a lot of air out while they sing. In singing, the vocal folds are opening and closing, and in a breathy vocal production the vocal folds may never fully come together so the singer is always leaking air. With \u201cefficient phonation\u201d the vocal folds will come together completely and so much less air is expelled. Resonance is an important part of singing, and this means finding ways to have your body naturally amplify the sound from the vocal folds. To accomplish the goal of efficient phonation, many singing teachers will stress good body alignment and the conscious use of various muscles related to breathing/inhalation. ",
