            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. In short, my answer is the same as everyone else's answer - which is interesting in itself because I wrote this before reading them. Everyone has their own eloquent way of putting it and I don't disagree with any of them. In fact, as you will see, my answer ends up being a pale imitation of everyone else's. Speaking solely for myself, I love music because it enfolds and encompasses, it is a force around me that I can fall into, be supported by or simply be transported through. I find that my mood tends to dictate the music I listen to but, in return, the music reflects my mood and can change it. Deep bass can thrum through my body and lungs, violins cause my scalp to tingle if done right, layers of instruments can build melodies and harmonies. I can follow different tracks through it, different layers and permutations, so that I can follow the singer or the melody or the bass or the guitars or the strings or the acoustic. Each time is different. Music reflects emotion or can create it. I can be blind-sided by strong waves of emotion such as the time I ended up having to stop driving to work one morning after a break-up (it was a week later) because listening to 'You Choose' by the Pet Shop Boys brought me to blubbering tears. Listening to 'Libera' one night in Leeds forced me to dance alone in my room with joy and freedom. Listening to 'Clubbed to Death' forced me to write. I like music because it is surprising and comforting. I've had music playing in my life for most of it. My mother liked hits from the 1960s and my father was a fan of Clannad and 1980s synth. I had a Walkman from a young age, maybe around 6, and used to find it beneficial to drift to sleep listening to tapes I had created. As I grew older I had a tape player in my room and would spend hours creating mix-tapes of various songs from a wide variety of sources. At University this was a well-practiced thing, with special mix-tapes for holidays and terms and revisiting them was a pleasure whilst I studied or wrote or played computer games. To me, music is familiar, routine. Even new music. It is comforting and challenging, emotional and beautiful. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone finds music different, so this obviously doesn\u2019t apply to everyone (as the question said, some autistic people). Often, we can be more affected by music. I watch a lot of Doctor Who, and I was having a conversation with someone a while ago about how different we see it. He\u2019s neurotypical, and his view of the episode is very much shaped by the way the actors behave and their expressions and tone of voice, etcetera. He notices the music, but it doesn\u2019t affect him as much as the acting. When I watch it, I\u2019m focusing more on the music. If the music is very fast, I tend to get more excited. A brilliant piece of music called \u201cBreaking The Wall\u201d was playing in a scene where the Doctor had to go through the same pain and torture over and over again. Most people found that scene sad or even a little disturbing, but I loved it. The music was utterly brilliant and I just found it amazing. I didn\u2019t see that scene the way most people did, because I listen to the music more than focusing on the characters. I personally love listening to music because it tells so much more than words. I can listen to the soundtrack of a film and be just as affected by it as someone who watched the film itself may be. So, I\u2019d say it could be because of a special interest, or even just because that person happens to be more affected by the music than what they see. ",
