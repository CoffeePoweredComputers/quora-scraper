            "answer_text": "Music is something that has long been interpreted by everyone . Its been said that songs such as Hotel California by The Eagles has a well known satanic worshiping man on the cover of the album . Its also been said of such bands as AC/DC stands for After Christ The Devil Comes and even KISS came in to play when it was said that KISS stood for Knights In Satan\u2019s Service . And one more for the road I suppose is that if you play The Beatles Revolution 9 backwards it has a subliminal message that say Let me out , let me out , over and over, and was implied to mean someone was in fiery depths of hell and wanted out . As to the validity of it all is anybody's guess . What it all boils down to is what the individual thinks and takes from it all . You can take anything and make it a sin or evil . That all comes from the hearts , minds, thoughts , and souls of the person partaking in what ever the case may be. I guess in the end that it\u2019s something you have to decide for yourself . Music which is universal , means one thing to one person , and something entirely different to another . As for the satanic bit which is to imply Bohemian Rhapsody is such a song ? I tend to think that evil lies more in the heart of man and his intent , and less in the suggestion of music itself . ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of \u201csatanic messages.\u201d The song contains the line \u201cBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me.\u201d \u2018Beelzebub\u2019 being a name for the devil, or \u2018prince of demons.\u2019 So it refers the devil, but it does not in anyway promotes Satan. In fact, in the context, it seems to be lamenting the damnation of the narrator, \u2018the poor boy\u2019, with one grouping damning him, and another pleading for his deliverance. (\u201cBismillah, no we will not let you go\u201d and \u201clet him go\u201d). Overall, I would argue this section more closely mirrors several operas rather than rocks songs with \u2018Satanic messages\u2019, and given the mock opera format, I am sure it is intentional. So, in short, the devil is mentioned, but I would not call it a \u2018satanic message.\u2019 ",
