            "answer_text": "At this point, I don't even want to guess why. Going through answers on Quora related to this topic is depressing, to say the least. On this thread, there are good answers written by people such as Inka Amelia, who\u2019s answer is a stunning example of how a subjective answer can be written with little to no bias and which is clearly well-thought out and does not in any way attempt to degrade the BLINK fandom nor Blackpink, but is instead aimed at the toxic portion of the fandom. I agree with her point of view, as toxic fans and saesangs really shouldn't be a thing at all. It\u2019s embarrassing that some BLINKs help propagate this image of the entire fandom being toxic, and I applaud Amelia\u2019s attempt to call them out on their actions. However, there are other answers which I disagree with, some partially, and some in their totality. But first of all, I\u2019ll answer the question posed by OP. Why do some ARMY\u2019s hate Blackpink so much? Well the truth is - they don't. To the best of my knowledge and from what I\u2019ve seen in real life, ARMYs are the nicest people. I have some friends who are ARMYs, and the most they have expressed for Blackpink is a neutral dislike, but not once have I seen anything from them which constitutes \u201chate\u201d. From what's I\u2019ve seen, especially on Quora, most of the hate seems mainly directed at BLINKs as well as Jennie. And this is just the general sense which I get. I have seen answers which drag everything about Blackpink, from the usual points on the pre-generated hype to the toxic BLINKs to the \u201cYG Princess\u201d conspiracy theories to things as extreme as bashing Chaeyoung and Jisoo for no apparent reason apart from their voices sounding \u201ctoo nasally\u201d and \u201cwithout emotion or tone\u201d. These people then go on to qualify their arguments by claiming to be vocal coaches. Now, some of the answers which reference the vocals in Blackpink are clearly written by actual vocal coaches, as those answerers list detailed reasons why they think Blackpink\u2019s vocals aren't that strong (I\u2019m not referring to these answers), but there are those who jump on the hype train and exaggerate those claims just for clout. Take, for example, \u201cI think Chaeyoung shouldn't sing in a nasal tone because she might damage her voice\u201d which is a good way to criticise without being rude. This is then turned into \u201cChaeyoung\u2019s voice is so nasally that I can't tell the difference between her voice and a trumpet\u201d See what I mean? It hurts every time. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s so much easier to hide behind your online presence and not have people confront you for the things you say, which is why people such as Kanai Fumiko choose to drag the BLINK fandom in its entirety, despite the fact that most BLINKs are by and large innocent of any of the accusations levelled against them, are able to post the things they do. Look, I get that you don't like Blackpink. But that doesn't give you the right to drag all of the people who support them just because you feel that they are overhyped and you feel the rivalry between BTS and Blackpink is unfounded. I\u2019ll start by saying I do agree with Fumiko\u2019s first point. He/She writes that the fandom drives (him/her) up the wall sometimes\u201d, and I totally agree. I mean, I\u2019m a BLINK, and the thought of other supposed \u201cBLINKs\u201d who ruin the image of other BLINKs does drive me up the wall as well. Even so, no matter how I think of it, I cannot bring myself to agree with his/her next statement, which is that BLINKs are toxic. C\u2019mon man. That was a cheap shot against all BLINKs. And you question why fanwars start? Let me give you some context. I\u2019m a BLINK myself, and I have never once dragged BTS for anything. I believe they are decent performers and definitely at the top of their game and the industry. If you look through my profile, you\u2019ll see that I don't degrade any ARMYs nor BTS, because that\u2019s never the right thing to do. Instead, I do advocate taking a leaf out of Inka Amelia\u2019s book - narrow your focus to the few people who do deserve your ire, because you carelessly throwing out such a generalisation is rude and shows your lack of empathy for BLINKs in general. Do you think we want to be associated with people who post hate comments on BTS videos? People who do that make me sick. I don't care if they're BLINKs, but it\u2019s disrespectful and straight out rude. So make that clear. Don't take a shot at all of us. A lesson in empathy: how'd you like it if I were to say \u201cAll ARMYs are toxic and disrespectful, and the sole reason behind their existence is to degrade Blackpink and BLINKs.\u201d? All of that - formed on the basis of Fumiko\u2019s answer. A blatant generalisation, based off the bias and ignorance of one person. I wouldn't ever say that, because it simply isn't true. So please, I implore you, stop dragging all BLINKs just for the heck of it. Fumiko continues by claiming that Blackpink have a lot of areas they can improve in, and drones aimlessly on saying that they are overrated, on the flimsy defence which is \u201cthis is my opinion\u201d. Look dude, your opinion is biased. It\u2019s clearly biased because you consciously choose to call out Blackpink on their flaws knowing that BTS aren't perfect too. I will be the first to admit that there are areas in which I do hope Blackpink will improve, but I could say the same for BTS. I could draw so many comparisons between BTS and other idols who are better in a specific area such as vocals or rapping that it would make them seem no better than trainees, but that would be pointless, wouldn't it? I know that there will always be idols better than Blackpink in their own way, but I choose to stan Blackpink because despite all that, I still like them. And what's wrong with that? Fumiko goes on to show disappointment at the rivalry between BLINKs and ARMYs. Quite frankly, I find that laughable and so, so ironic. Fumiko, you need to understand one thing. These fanwars are only perpetuated by fans such as yourself who choose to elevate one group onto a pedestal at the expense of the degradation of another group, who you just so happen to not like. People such as yourself blame the rivalry on BLINKs, without ever realising they are the ones who form the source of the conflict to begin with. And also - I don't think there\u2019s any war to be had between fandoms. How old are you again, 5? Does it excite you - the notion that you\u2019ll be able to embark on your personal crusade to show that Blackpink is really really reallllly bad? Do you feel good knowing that answers such as yours contribute to the degradation of the image of all ARMYs? Do you feel somehow righteous, a knight in shining armour coming to rescue the damsel in distress, who is in this case all the other misled fans such as yourself who have taken leave of reason? You should be ashamed of yourself. If you\u2019re looking for unbiased, well-thought out answers, refer to answers written by Natalie Villalovos, who calls out ARMYS who play the role of antis; Isla Burnham, who calmly analyses the sequence of events leading to a \u201cfanwar\u201d and Anonymous, whose answer is the perfect balance of constructive criticism as well as a hypothesis regarding the hate, with no assumptions thrown in. All the other answers range from \u201cok, I guess\u201d to \u201cBlackpink is the worst group ever because [insert overused argument to drag Blackpink here]\u201d. A waste of space and valuable time. I won't link them, because I don't think it\u2019s worth reading. Hate should never be a thing in any fandom. Be supportive. Be encouraging - and save your hate for those who tear down all the effort and hard work you invest into building a good image for your fandom. Don\u2019t be another Kanai Fumiko. ",

            "answer_text": "In order to avoid people who may try to accuse me of generalizations, I\u2019m going to make it pretty clear that I\u2019m only referring to the \u201ctoxic armys.\u201d No they shouldn\u2019t be a representative of the entire fandom, but we still need to discuss their behavior towards Blackpink because it has gone far beyond just disliking them, and turned into actively seeking ways to bash these girls who aren\u2019t really deserving of the amount of hate they receive. Now I\u2019m by no means a Blink, I\u2019ve been critical of Blackpink\u2019s stage presence, music, etc in the past. But there\u2019s a difference between constructive criticism and pure hate. Blackpink was the first kpop girl group that I genuinely liked, and although I\u2019m not really a fan now, I still want to see them succeed. My criticism comes from a place of wanting Blackpink to do better. It\u2019s frustrating to see their company not give them a full album after three years. Their fans and Blackpink deserve better. I can understand why things like this might drive people away from Blackpink, especially if they are an Army. I\u2019m pretty sure BTS released more music in 2018 than Blackpink has in their entire idol careers. But when do you cross the line? When does dislike turn to bullying? Is making entire threads dedicated to completely degrading and shaming these girl acceptable because \u201cits just my opinion\u201d Now I\u2019m going to go discuss the main reason I see \u201ctoxic Armys\u201d hating Blackpink for. Kpop idols are nothing more than just products forced by their companies to sing and dance. They are nothing like BTS. BTS are the only true artists that came from the industry. They are the only ones who are deserving of the love and success they have. Other Kpop groups shouldn\u2019t even try to target the western industry. America only has love for one group, and that\u2019s BTS.  As you can see a lot of the hate directed at towards Black Pink originates from \u201cwestern fans\u201d who believe any korean group who tries to make it in the west are inferior. They measure a person\u2019s worth on the amount of awards they won, albums they\u2019ve sold, and concerts they\u2019ve sold out. It\u2019s ironic because according to their logic BTS\u2019s music and artistry in 2013\u20132015, would\u2019ve have been worthless because they weren\u2019t as popular or successful as other groups. I have no doubt that many of these \u201cfans\u201d joined in 2017 or later now that BTS is mainstream. They like to pretend they would\u2019ve supported BTS from the beginning, but the way they judge and mock groups who aren\u2019t as successful as others, I really doubt that. I\u2019m just going to leave this message from Yoongi here. \u201c Because you are all Kpop idols, I don\u2019t have to listen to you to know that you suck\u201d I don\u2019t like your lyrics, it\u2019s obvious. You have no power so you probably did something fishy. Seeing what you\u2019ve done I know you\u2019re going to fail. (thank you so much) Because of your own inferiority complex I was able to prove myself something I wasn\u2019t able to do in high school Hands clapping, yes, keep on going, keep on going We\u2019ll be happy by ourselves Good, yeah, I\u2019m good - Min Yoongi 2016(2 3 hoping for better days) ",
