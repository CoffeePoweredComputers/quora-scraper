            "answer_text": "This dude.  Jason Ethier aka ImJaystation is a \u2019YouTuber\u2019 who makes ouija board-spirit-summoning sort of videos, \u2018scary\u2019 3AM challenge videos and similar stuff. Besides the fact that all those videos are fake and terribly acted; they are also exploiting children who really loves this niche sort of content. Jaystation have made several pathetic low-class content, for example: Faked his girlfriend\u2019s death.  His girlfriend, Alexia, helped Jason during this by proving her audio saying \u201cI miss you\u201d for the ouija board video. She did not want to help him though, Jason pushed her to say it while she was sleeping. Jason had also been reported to have assaulted Alexia on two different occasions. These are accusations and claims from Alexia, there is no guarantee about the authenticity, One time, he threw a smartphone at Alexia\u2019s face, which he was punished for by the police (I think)And on the second occasion, he picked up Alexia from the couch and THREW her on the FLOOR.Jason had no plans to reveal that her girlfriend was alive. But, he was forced to do it when Alexia\u2019s father found out about it. He threatened Jason to publicly accept that she is alive or he would go on news. He made a video about it where he addressed that the whole thing was fake, however, he made no attempts to apologize to his fans. Instead, he blamed Alexia for leaving him. He used his usual manipulative techniques to make his young audience believe that he was innocent. He said that he made her rich (didn\u2019t pay her for helping him during his videos). Alexia responded to it by her video addressing his assaults (mentioned above) and other behind the scenes that the audience didn\u2019t knew about. She mentioned that Jason was extremely suspicious of her. He didn\u2019t allow her to have ANY social media; forced to delete, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube, etc. He also went through her contacts looking for y\u2019know, boys. He asked her not to talk to any of them, even those who knew Alexia WAY BEFORE they even got together. Jason abused his power by asking his young naive audience to go to her video and report it. He recorded him reporting her video and encouraged his fans to do the same thing. This is against YouTube\u2019s guidelines; falsely flagging someone\u2019s videos and bullying another creator. Exploits the death of other people. Etika.A YouTuber and Twitch streamer known as Etika, commited suicide somewhere during June, 2019. He uploaded a video before commiting, which was seen as a suicide note. It was heartbreaking to see at least. Entire YouTube community was paying respects. People donated charity to mental help organisations & Etika\u2019s parents. HOWEVER, as it was expected from Jaystation.. He uploaded a video where he \u2018talked\u2019 to Etika with Ouija board. This video was certainly hated and he was severely criticized. He took the video down but guess what he did?He uploaded a response video where, once again, he DID NOT apologize sincerely. Instead, he said that every other YouTube was also exploiting his death by donating. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me how donating to mental health organisations is exploiting. He then went on to rant about how he is also depressed and tried to gain some empathy, I am glad he didn\u2019t get it. 2. XXXTentacion. A young rapper that was shot in June, 2018. He was a popular rapper with huge audience. So of course as you know, Jaystation made a video exploiting him for views. 3. MAC MILLER Another rapper that he used. Other fucked up things that Jaystation did includes; buying slaves from Deepweb (fake of course), A \u2018black Santa\u2019 that he claimed to summon up. It was racist stereotypical black guy speaking hood. He also made a video of a \u2018gay-potion\u2019. Personally the video of kind of homophobic since he was attributing flamboyant behaviour and nauseous things to homosexual people. Jaystation is honestly the scum-y and lowest point of YouTuber who makes videos unconcerned about the well beings of kids who watch these videos thinking that it\u2019s all real. It\u2019s the edgy content for them to feed upon. Jaystation knows that kids love these and no matter how much hate he receives, there will always be gullible children who will watch him. He is a manipulative klazomaniac who calls disrespecting dead people entertainment. This fopdoodle have also gave birth to this whole 3AM challenges/ouija board/calling fictional characters, etc. If you go on YouTube and search for these content, you\u2019ll find kids making similar videos. This man is turning the next generation into an awful nightmare. So yeah, I hate him more than I hate sweets, and sweets are the most unpleasant things for me. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, right now I have very strong negative feelings towards a certain \u201cPolitician\u201d. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Why do I dislike her? Because she\u2019s lying to people and saying outrageously foolish things, and yet people still seem to follow her. It\u2019s very frustrating. It seems like we live in an age where people no longer care about facts or truth, or even what makes sense. I\u2019ve been called racist, xenophobic, sexist, whatever just for talking bad about her, I couldn\u2019t care less. I care about political integrity at least a little bit, which is why I don\u2019t give Trump any passes either. People need to be held accountable for what they actually say. Being a minority woman is not enough to be a leader, you actually have to have positive qualities and attributes, and be relatively informed about the topic you are arguing. Don\u2019t go on live TV to trash Israel and then say in the same interview, \u201cI\u2019m not an expert on geopolitics.\u201d Let\u2019s go over a few things people seem to say about her a lot. No one is intimidated by her. I\u2019ve heard this a million times, which means all the people saying it must be watching the same BS Liberal News show that is endorsing her. She is incredibly foolish, says ridiculously stupid things, and has no clue how economics work at all. Conservatives are criticizing her in order to combat the many idiotic news stations that are trying to tell us how great she is.She is NOT intelligent. Having a degree in something doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re good at it, it\u2019s just a credential. That she is somehow good because she\u2019s going to learn\u2026? Sorry, we don\u2019t need politicians that have the ability to learn, we need ones that are ALREADY capable of doing the job they have, and doing it well.Capitalism has not \u201cfailed\u201d anyone. It\u2019s a system completely free of bias or control, complete free market. If you\u2019re not successful in this country, you are responsible for that, not the government.Democratic Socialism is a made-up term. This country had slavery that was democratic and decided upon, as well as regulated. It was STILL slavery. Making something Democratic does not mean it\u2019s good or that it works. It has been proven time and time again that Socialism is corrupt and does NOT work.Here\u2019s why we insult her. Because of you geniuses who think she\u2019s going to lead this country anywhere good. She has openly said that, \u201cunemployment is down because people have two jobs\u201d, \u201cClimate change will be our World War 2\u201d, \u201cI won\u2019t debate Ben Shapiro for $10,000 because that\u2019s catcalling\u201d, \u201c17 year-olds can walk into gun shops and buy an \u2018assault weapon.\u201d, \u201cHow is Columbus day a holiday but Election day is not?\u201d I mean, all of these things are what we have heard from, plus the countless economics plans that are 100% not affordable or unethical. We are not making up things about her, these things are public, I urge you to look them up. Her \u201cideas\u201d are embarrassing and are just not feasible, to the point where it is comical.I am a huge proponent of trying to respect people\u2019s political positions, regardless of whether I agree or not\u2026 But this is not okay. The amount of people following her without actually understanding or researching how awful of a leader she is, is quite shameful. She is the EXACT model of what a corrupt, bad politician looks like. She makes all these promises that she cannot possibly uphold in order to advance her own career and put more money in her pocket, as well as acquire more attention. She is taking advantage of those who are hoping that things will get better, when in reality, she doesn\u2019t actually know how to take care of this country at all. I\u2019m not saying this for no reason. Here\u2019s the proof. She recently promised everyone that the United States will be converting all power sources into renewable energy sources, and that it will be completed within a decade. Here\u2019s what the current energy source distribution looks like.  As you can see\u2026 her idea is impossible. But she doesn\u2019t know that, nor does she care. All she cares about is that people believe her, and that they trust her and support her so she can advance. I mean, there are tons of people who want her to be President! That is DANGEROUSLY foolish. I care about the United States. I am proud of this country, and what we have accomplished. I am afraid of what the people of this country are putting their faith into. If you\u2019re reading this, I URGE you to research into the topics we discuss, instead of blindly following her. I don\u2019t want to see this country turn into one of those Socialist disaster countries, just so some bartender from New York can get rich off of our mistakes. ",
