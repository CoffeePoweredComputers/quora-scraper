The beast for budget gamers.i3 8 gen proccesor is person who want to surf play normal low graphics game and normal video editing In recent test i5 8 gen has beat i7 7 gen proccesor in terms of benchmarks Mostly proccesor helps to run the game but the most important role is gpu if u have 6 gb gpu u can play games in high settings without any laggy experience and same the i5 8 gen has 2gb gpu then the game will be laggy in high settings and not smooth experience low fps I5 8 gen is future proof u can close your eyes and buy this budget beast I3 8 gen will be old and most of heavy software will be not running smoothly after some years So choose as per your requirements Hope u get the points For more info watch this video  ",

            "answer_text": "Well an i3 8th gen(I am considering the base i3 8100 which is more common, not the 8300K) is highly powerful, better than the Ryzen 3 2200G(not GPUwise) and R3 1300X. And offcourse its better and powerful than the i5 5th gen(desktop) as 8100 has better cache memories. Elsewise, 8100 is much similar to a i5 7400(almost similarly powerful). That's for desktop.In laptops processors, an i3 8th gen(8130U) is way way better and powerful than an i5 5200U(5th gen). ",
