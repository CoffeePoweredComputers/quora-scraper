            "answer_text": "Australia has some very fine composers, many of whom reflect the heat and epic vastness of the landscape in their music. Some, like Peter Sculthorpe, incorporate elements of Aboriginal music such as rain sticks and the didgeridoo. The following piece doesn\u2019t need them to evoke the primeval mood of dense mangrove forests stretching over thousands upon thousands of square kilometres in northern Australia. Mangrove  Ross Edwards is similarly influenced by First Nations culture. Often his music exhibits an almost \u2018classical\u2019 poise, gravitating towards a mixolydian modal centre instead of the traditional dominant-to-tonic relationship. In addition he\u2019s fascinated by the clicks and chirps of the avian and insect worlds, sometimes heard in the form of tiny melodic and rhythmic motifs frequently reappearing throughout a work. This is but one characteristic of his style that has led some commentators to inaccurately label him a minimalist. Being a true original, he\u2019s nowhere near that easy to pigeon-hole. Here\u2019s his Violin Concerto. Maninyas  Many Australian composers are proudly multicultural. One well worth investigating, whose background is Russian, is Elena Kats-Chernin. Also a fine pianist who has made many recordings of her own works, she is a prolific polystylist composer who receives commissions from soloists, chamber groups and orchestras worldwide. Sometimes jazz-infused, her music is as urbane as Poulenc\u2019s, Rorem\u2019s and Piazzola\u2019s, but with a lot more deep blues and purples. Here\u2019s something in bright colours. Eliza\u2019s Aria from the ballet Wild Swans.  Another composer being increasingly recognised internationally is Georges Lentz, born in Luxembourg. In addition to its Australian-ness, his music is informed by a deep engagement with astronomy and existentialism. Georges Lentz - Wikipedia It\u2019s impossible to sum up in a few words the intense focus and almost visceral sensuality with which Lentz evokes the cosmic spirit of the Australian outback, a space that can be overwhelming, unnerving and frightening to European sensibilities unused to complex textures of emptiness. It\u2019s best to hear the music itself. Perhaps the most edgy of his works is the hour-long Ingwe for solo electric guitar, available in a performance by Zane Banks on a Naxos recording, but not complete on YouTube. To me, it\u2019s a concentrated paean to the alien, terrifying beauty of burning, blindingly glaring Nothing, with obligatory sharp rocks underfoot and merciless swarms of sweat-sucking flies, perhaps the best evocation of that particular characteristic of the Australian outback since the classic film Wake in Fright, though there are no people anywhere in Lentz\u2019s vision to humanise it. Even the solo guitarist is quickly obliterated by shattering flares of electronic feedback. In the quiet second half, any sense of horizon there may have been finally disappears; the landscape merges with space itself. I love the piece when in the right euphorically bleak or bleakly euphoric mood, but it\u2019s definitely not for everybody. I won\u2019t link an excerpt as it deserves to be heard as the composer intended - in toto. Here\u2019s a more \u2018accessible\u2019 work. Caeli enarrant\u2026 VII, \u201cMysterium\u201d: Monh - for viola and orchestra.  ",
