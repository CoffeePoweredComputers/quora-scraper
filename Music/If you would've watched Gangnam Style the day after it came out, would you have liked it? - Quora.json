            "answer_text": "I was watching the GSL (Global Starcraft 2 League) when I saw it for the first time and I didn't like it or hate it I just thought it was funny (I think the first time I saw it it was without audio so I didn't even hear the song). Then I saw it a few more times this time with audio and I still mostly thought it was funny I liked it a little bit. Then it just kept coming up and I was like wtf is going on ? Then I heard it on the radio in Switzerland and I was like ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? I do respect Psy though he's doing his thing and even though his new stuff Napal Baji and Daddy is not a viral sensation I think it's great that he can have his own unique style and be successful, There are so many girl groups and by groups in korea and the solo artists mostly sing balads. He's doing something completely different alone and making it work. I'm not a big fan of his and I don't love every song he makes but I don't think his success is undeserved either.  ",
