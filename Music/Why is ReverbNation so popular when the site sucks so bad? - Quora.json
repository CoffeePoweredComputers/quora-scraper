            "answer_text": "They want you to enter to be heard by a record label and it eventually costs money to stay with them which is ridiculous too.The thing that I hate about record labels is they want to control how you do music and what music you can release and there is no freedom in doing that.I am a musician and singer/songwriter,yet I am not being controlled when it comes to me or my music.Garth Brooks even talked once about his battles with Capitol Recordsand since then he has had his own record label Pearl Records.The same happened with Toby Keith,Michael Martin Murphey and others.Today's artists usually seek to start independent labels.The record labels are big record labels because of connections and money.It is a shame that independent labels won't join together to form a major label to compete with the powers that be then maybe true justice would be served.
