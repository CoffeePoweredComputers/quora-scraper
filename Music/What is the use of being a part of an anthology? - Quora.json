            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what kind of writing you do, or where you are on your writing journey. What follows is for the people I work with, folks who write for business or to promote their business. There are two kinds of anthologies. In one kind of anthology, others validate your expertise. For example, I was asked to submit a chapter to the ATD\u2019s Management Development Handbook. Editors picked me as one of forty experts. This kind of anthology is almost always worth the investment of your time. In another kind of anthology, a group of colleagues, friends, experts, what have you, get together and produce a book where they each write a chapter. Sometimes this is put together by a single entrepreneur and you pay to play. Other times everyone shares the cost of editing and publication. If you\u2019re going to participate in an anthology like this, pay attention to who else will be there. Recognized experts is good. A bunch of no-names is not. These seem to me to work when one person has responsibility for production. That person may be one of the players or may be a hired professional. Usually, the people who write chapters also market the book. This usually results in very uneven amounts of work. Sometimes, the group hires someone to market the book. You will invest time and money in this kind of anthology, so judge i t as a business investment. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are a part of an anthology, it means you write short pieces. Now tell me what is the use of writing ? Do you write because you enjoy writing ? Do you write you because you want to be read ? If the answer to last two questions is yes, then it makes sense for you to be a part of an anthology and reach an audience who like reading short stories, poetry or articles. If the answer to my first question is not covered in the last two questions, then you may have your own reasons to write, which may be to earn money or become famous etc. In those cases, being part of an anthology , may not be a very good idea.

            "answer_text": "The use is exposing your name/work to a larger audience who may not hear of you otherwise (or not want to take a chance), depending upon the genre, but I typically see horror and sci-fi, the most. It lets readers of the genre sample new-to-them authors in short story format I enjoyed a short story in an anthology from author David Dalglish - this was about 2012\u20132013, I think. That story stuck with me so I kept tabs on his projects - now go see what he\u2019s doing. ;-) ",
