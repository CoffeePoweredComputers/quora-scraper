            "answer_text": "I mean we cannot predict these things easily. It takes some people years to even earn a nomination let alone win a Grammy. Some of the biggest stars in the world have never won a Grammy. That aside, it is like that in 2020 BTS will earn a Grammy nomination for their music (most likely Best Pop Album/Best Group Performance). Whether they win it or not is another story. I hope they win a Grammy in the near future and not just one but many. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, BTS is not respected by Music Critics which explains why they have not won or been nominated any internationals awards for their music. Although, they have won BBMAs and AMAs for their Fan army. The Impression BTS would give to the Critics would be a bunch of young men dancing Gangnam Style on a boat. BTS would have to prove themselves to the critics in order to win an international award for their music. ",
