            "answer_text": "This question could be read a few different ways\u2026 As written, Is it bad to plug a guitar amp into a speaker cabinet? No. Guitar amps are meant to be plugged into speaker cabinets. A guitar amp head appreciates being plugged into a pile of speakers. So, no, that is not a bad thing. Is it bad to plug a guitar amp into commercial stereo speakers? Probably not going to be a good thing. Plus it would take some work to make this happen (since most stereo speakers want +/- wires or banana clips. But if you have a couple stereo monitors with 1/4\u2033 jacks you could make this work. You just wouldn\u2019t get optimal sound and you need to watch impedance. (See other comments in this string for details.) Is it bad to plug a guitar amp into a stereo? A number of guitar amps these days are built for studio, practice and/or stage use. That said you may find that your amp can accommodate RCA or 1/8\u2033 headphone or 1/4\u2033 headphone output. If that is the case, then feel free to connect to a stereo. Can I plug my guitar directly into a stereo? There was a time in college where I used a boom box for a practice amp. I just went to Radio Shack and bought a 1/4\u2033 female mono to RCA stereo connector cable. It worked. And just for fun, If I plug my amp into my TV input will it create interesting visuals? Yes. Best if you have an old non-HD TV with an RCA video input. Again it\u2019s best to use a headphone or RCA out on your amp. You could also use your effect out if you have a 1/4\u2033 to RCA converter cable. Plug the amp into the TV. Turn down the lights. And play away. You should see some wave modulation in the video signal. The more you distort the guitar, the more gritty the video feedback should get. The moral of this story. It\u2019s fun to experiment. But with experimentation comes some risk (of blowing speakers and/or TV tubes). ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you are asking if it is bad to plug a guitar amp into a speaker cabinet made for a HiFi stereo rather than into a speaker cabinet made to be used with guitar amps. Here are the questions to ask: Can the speakers handle the power? A 100 watt tube amp at full volume could destroy a tiny set of speakers rated for 25 watts. I once plugged a tiny 3 inch speaker from a transistor radio into a 60 watt tube amp. It sounded lively with a fantastic buzz/fuzz sound for about 5 seconds before fizzing out and falling forever silent.Is it the right impedance?A guitar amp built to drive an 8 ohm speaker may not sound ideal on a speaker with a different rating (4 ohm, 16 ohm, 32 ohm, etc).As long as these first two questions are answered affirmatively, it is safe to connect a guitar amp\u2019s speaker output to a HiFi speaker cabinet. But the most important question is this: Will it sound good?Guitar amp speakers are voiced to emphasize a guitar\u2019s audio frequency range and their frequency response usually falls off sharply after 5 kHz. The highest note on a guitar is around 1000 Hz so reproducing higher frequencies just isn\u2019t needed. Hi Fi speakers are usually built to evenly reproduce a fuller range of frequencies all the way up to 18\u201320 kHz. A guitar could sound brittle through a HiFi speaker as a result of all that extra top end.",
