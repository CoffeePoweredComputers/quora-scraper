            "answer_text": "Parenting is a little difficult. There are some effective measures that can be undertaken. Make a behavior contract with the child. A behavior contract is a contract signed by the parent and the child. In this you mention the behavior you don't like , you write the date and both parent and child sign this contract. The speciality of this contract is a reward. This reward could be something she likes such as increased play time or reading. A reward that she likes is important and the time period for this contract maybe a week. If she doesn't make the behavioral change then some time from her play time may be reduced. If this doesn't work out Try changing the rewards. The child Should be explained the consequences of bad behavior such as time out or reducing Playtime etc. and the rewards if the child behaves in the appropriate manner. Use praise as well when she does not exhibit that behavior, as you have mentioned when she doesn't watch that content you must praise her. If the child exhibits correct behavior then the child is rewarded. Speak to the child and use this technique. It's interesting and has been used in the United States. A behavior contract has the following important points : Name - parent and child nameDateTime periodRewardConsequences such as time out or reduced playtime.If this fails then try changing rewards. Counsel the child. ",
