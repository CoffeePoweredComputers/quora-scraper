And as all very big places with dozens of countries and even more cultures, I can\u2019t even begin to understand a tenth of it (And I\u2019m a Brazilian married to a Venezuelan who traveled thought 3 other south american countries). So the best I can do for you is explain Brazilian music :D So Brazil has about 492839023 different rhythms (and that is an accurate number ;) ) and yes, we do have Hip-Hop. Is just that Brazilians are by nature very jovial and good natured people, so our music reflects that. Things who are depressing have audience, but is almost impossible that something like that can be danced to, or used in a \u201cTrio Eletrico\u201d so it won\u2019t get famous here. Even the Gospel music of Brazil is WAYYYY more lively than \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d type stuff. In Brazilian churches you could (even though most don\u2019t) jump up and down and dance at the rhythm of Gospel music. So ya, depressing things have no place in Brazil. ",
