            "answer_text": "It depends on what you'll tune your guitar to, but it's a bad idea to begin with. You'll never be able to fit a complete 6 string bass set on a guitar and tune it to standard tuning, you'll break it in half well before reaching any playable tuning. It won't be an instant short scale bass either, unfortunately. But we metal heads used to fit .62 or even .65 bass strings as our 6th string and use 5 strings of a 10\u201352 guitar string set for the others, so 13\u201352, to downtune to A or B without going floppy, but we usually had to drill the E string peg to fit the string through. Nowadays you can buy them as a complete set, which is way better, usually. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh you can have a fun time with that. Invite a few friends over for the event. Drill out the peg holes, file down the nut slots and you\u2019re on your way. Have everyone watch as you crank the strings tighter and tighter until the guitar rips apart. Then you can break out the beer, take a seat and talk about how fast guitar wood burns in the fire pit. A special occasion to be sure. ",
