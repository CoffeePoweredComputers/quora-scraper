            "answer_text": "I find it off-putting. I think that great harm is done to evangelism when \u201cChristian\u201d preachers do this. This reminds me of Westboro Baptist Church and \u201cRev.\u201d Fred Phelps (and now his daughters\u2014what I also find despicable is that these are the people who spew their bile at the funerals and gravesites of our fallen soldiers, AND that some are also lawyers, who will persecute AND prosecute those who stand against them). These people give fundamental Christianity a bad name. When the Apostle Paul spoke at Mars Hill (also referred to as the Areopagus), he didn\u2019t begin by saying\u201dYou filthy, disgusting, perverted idolaters and faggots! Listen to the gospel, you scum.\u201d He began by saying: \u201cMen of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with the inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown, I am going to proclaim to you.\u201d (Acts 17:22\u201323, NIV). His purpose was to persuade these people of the truth of his words, not insult and upbraid them. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, this isn\u2019t a question. This is a statement. Please figure this out and create a question before an answer can be provided. Edit: Now that it\u2019s a question, there are a few things that should be noted in my answer. For starters, yes. Protests get dirty and disgusting constantly. I\u2019m a regular protester for different things myself. But no matter how vile it may seem to us, it\u2019s not in our right to do anything about it. So long as they\u2019re peaceful about it. Honestly, the Bieber fans were more misbehaved than the protesters were, if that tells you anything. Secondly, this question is seeking validation of opinion. We don\u2019t do that here on Quora. However, that definitely explains why you\u2019re anonymous. Please don\u2019t abuse that feature either like you are right now, we don\u2019t appreciate it. ",

There are better ways to protest events that Christians don\u2019t agree with. (I\u2019m sure there were some Christians at this concert.) They could\u2019ve walked among the kids and shared Christ\u2019s love with them and given them something to read. Their brashness only turned the kids off. The old saying is \u201cyou can attract more flies with honey than you can with vinegar.\u201d There\u2019s a time to stand for Christ vocally like this, but I don\u2019t think they did a real service to the kids they were trying to drive into going the \u201cright\u201d way, and perhaps they even harmed the cause of Christ by using such an approach. This is only my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "This is wrong. They may be Christians, but true disciples of Jesus are generally wonderful people. You feel comfortable around them, they accept you as you are, and they see the precious jewel that you are, just as God does. Christians are called to speak the truth. Christians are not called to heap shame on someone. If you encounter anyone who claims they follow Jesus, and tell you that you are a pervert and make you feel ashamed, then immediately disregard their words. To clarify any confusion, read John or Mark. Learn about what Jesus did when He came to earth, why He did it. Christians are supposed to mimic Jesus in every way possible.
