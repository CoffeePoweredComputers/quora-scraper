            "answer_text": "Before you even think of working on vibrato, it's vitally important to establish a good foundation of left-hand technique on the cello. Respected cello pedagogues such as Phyllis Young writing in her excellent book Playing the String Game note that the moment to begin conscious work on vibrato has to be chosen carefully, according to a player's preparedness with more basic technical \"conditions\". Bad vibrato habits, once they take hold, can be very difficult to undo and they'll interfere with other aspects of cello technique. The muscle movements of a good, relaxed, musical-sounding vibrato are not really something that you micro-manage consciously as much as you \"set in motion\", so vibrato is very tricky to practise in a strictly conscious way. However, if you're ready to dive in, here are some thoughts. As referred to by Bob Smith, the vibrato motion employed by classical guitarists is a very useful jumping-off point for developing the feeling of a good cello vibrato. The discussion found on pages 91 and 92 of Charles Duncan's The Art of Classical Guitar Playing offers some vital points, including: (1) the motion is produced by the entire left arm (2) the left wrist is basically \"straight\" (or \"aligned\") and the left hand makes no conscious movement independently of the arm (3) the motion is better described as a shaking of the arm rather than a rotating or twisting (on this point, I appear to disagree with Sylvia Hujanen); on cello, allowing the wrist to \"sink\" and/or twisting the forearm usually produces a terrible, tight vibrato, a habit which needs to be avoided at all costs. Jodie Bhattacharya's suggestion is virtually the same exercise that we did in school strings class: touch one of the strings (perhaps D or G) with one of the fingertips (perhaps middle finger), shake the forearm quite vigorously while allowing the fingertip to slide along the string, progressively shortening the range of the shaking and finally focussing the fingertip on a single location on the fingerboard. Even once the fingertip centers on a single pitch, keep the arm shaking freely with as little tension in the left thumb as is practical. Repeat several times with different fingers and strings.   No matter what, at the instant that you catch yourself using a twisting/rotating motion, producing an unmusical vibrato sound, or tensing up your left arm as you practise vibrato, stop. Do the exercise above to rediscover the free, relaxed shaking sensation and continue. Always be attentive to that sensation and your vibrato will surely improve and come more and more under your musical control over time. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no substitute for feeling it. I can't tell you you how to feel it. Anyway... on the guitar it is different because there are frets.This attenuates the vibrato so that we (guitarists) may pour it on without harm. The cello takes a bit more finesse.Relax. Don't torture it. Make love to it. Try to communicate through the sound. Vibrato is the emotional tone of your musical voice.Again, relax. Try playing one note without any pressure from the thumb.Just put the one finger on the fingerboard and try to practice waving it aroundto find the right amount of vibrato. Try it with different fingers and notes.Now we know what to looks like when one exceeds the limits, and that less effort to hold a note is needed that is sometimes applied. And hopefully what a vibrato'd note sounds like and what to do to get it.Now try this on a part that needs vibrato and see of your playing has caught up to your quest for expression. ",

            "answer_text": "Sylvia already addressed a lot of the basics for a good vibrato, so I'm not going to repeat those. One thing to keep in mind is that cello strings are much longer and lower than violin or viola.  This means our vibrato should be wider and slower, or you wind up sounding like a nervous nanny goat, and who wants that? You may want to experiment with things like taping a rattle or matchbox onto the back of your left hand and try to \"shake\" that to get a feel for what you want to happen.  Remember, your whole arm from elbow to fingertip is one unit when you vibrato, not just fingers or from the wrist like upper strings sometimes use. Finally, the key word with vibrato and indeed just about any cello playing, is RELAX.  Tension is our enemy. ",

            "answer_text": "Practice. A good vibrato combines a wide variety of seemingly contradictory characteristics: it is strong and gentle, intense and soft, etc. Of course, this means that there is not one standard \"perfect vibrato\", but rather a gamut of vibratos that will be better suited to different pieces and playing techniques and that you will eventually develop as you play different pieces with different styles.   With this in mind, I would suggest you to get a good reference recording of a piece you know and try to replicate the sound. Careful observation of a proficient player will also be useful, but in order to get the feeling to achieve a variety of possibilities, you will need to spend a good time trying for yourself possible variations. Of course, if you are able to get some face-to-face feedback from a more advanced cello player that observes your technique, that would also be helpful. By the way, vibrato is not the first step in learning,  so if you are still trying to figure out the basics, you may want to leave vibrato alone for a few months. ",
