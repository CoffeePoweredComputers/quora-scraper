            "answer_text": "The notes given in the comment are exactly the notes used in the Spanish version of E Phrygian, the most common key for the flamenco rhythm Soleares, at least relative to the cejilla (flamenco capo) if one is used. Assuming that you listed the chords in the order that you use them, then the progression is not particularly common in Soleares, but all of those notes (and usually no others except for possibly an occasional chromatic run) are used in Soleares. Phrygian mode is the third mode of the major scale, so using C major, the Phrygian mode has the notes E F G A B C D. But the Spanish version is related to this in a way similar to the relationship between natural minor and harmonic minor. Sticking with the C major base, the minor mode begins on A, and A natural minor has the notes A B C D E F G, and A harmonic minor has the notes A B C D E F G#. Thus all of your notes are in these two modes. The Spanish version of E Phrygian has the notes E F G# A B C D (and once in a while D# to sweeten the upward resolution to E). The most common use of E Phrygian in Soleares is to keep the G natural in melodies but switch to G# for the resolution chord, making it an E Major chord instead of an E Minor chord. Thus the \u201chome\u201d chord is E Major, but otherwise everything is in standard E Phrygian. The downward resolution is the \u201cPhrygian cadence\u201d F Major chord to E Major chord, and this is the definitive Spanish sound (e.g., Lecuona\u2019s Malague\u00f1a, which is based on the flamenco Malague\u00f1a rhythm). A common lead-in to the Phrygian cadence is to precede it with an A Minor chord followed by a G Major chord; the F Major and E Major chords that follow will no doubt sound extremely familiar. Of course, music is a combinatorial exercise, and the number of possibilities using your notes and chords is immense. ",

            "answer_text": "often \u201cout-of-key\u201d notes occur when one chord that _is_ part of the key is momentarily \u201ctonicised\u201d\u2014 that is, when you use chords in the key of a given chord to give that chord, momentarily, the function of a tonic. a common example of this is V of V (\u201cfive of five\u201d). in the key of C major, the V chord is G. of course, G contains only tones within the key of C (G-B-D). a common progression is ii V. ii in C is D minor (again, totally within the key, D-F-A). but another common progression is V/V V (\u201cfive-of-five\u201d to \u201cfive\u201d). in C, as stated, V is G. V _of_ G is D. to get D, you need an F#, which is not part of the C major scale. but just using a D major chord (II, \u201cmajor two\u201d) to tonicise V does not change the key of the piece; it would still be a C major piece. are all your \u201cforeign\u201d notes used in this way, temporarily tonicising a chord that is part of the key? analyse your progression in that context, and see if it doesn\u2019t become clear what key your progression is in.
