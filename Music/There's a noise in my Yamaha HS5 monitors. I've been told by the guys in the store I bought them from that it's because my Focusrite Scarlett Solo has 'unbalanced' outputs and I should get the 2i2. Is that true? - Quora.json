After trying almost everything, it turned out that the reason for the noise is the fact that one of the monitor-powering AC cables was partially broken/something interrupted or not giving a good connection inside of it (the way it came out of the box, actually) but how could I\u2019ve known\u2026:) ",

I have a Focusrite 18i6 with balanced outputs, and it is completely silent with my monitors using balanced cables, but is not with unbalanced cables\u2026 so, this easily could be your problem. But then, because I have a balanced setup, I haven\u2019t been as careful as possible to make sure that the grounds are perfect, etc. ",
