            "answer_text": "First, I'm not sure I could really give objective advice as to which Vocaloid to listen to. The more popular ones have more songs, and since they're usually also popular with producers, will likely have better songs on average. However, they don't necessarily have the most human voices. Luka and Gumi, especially, are extremely popular but it's rare to find an amazing cover or original with them. So if you want good songs, listen to the most popular - Miku, Rin and Len, Luka, Gumi, IA. If you want good voices, Yuzuki Yukari, Nekomura Iroha, v flower, IA, and VY1V4 have some extremely human-sounding songs. So, now the huge list of Vocaloid characters, followed by the list of updates: Vocaloid 1 - Leon, Lola, Meiko, Kaito, Miriam Vocaloid 2 - Sweet Ann, Big Al, Hatsune Miku, Prima, Kagamine Rin and Len, Gackpoid (\"Gakupo\"), Megurine Luka, Megpoid (\"Gumi\"), Kaai Yuki, Hiyama Kiyoteru, SF-A2 Miki, Lily, VY1, VY2, Sonika, Tonio, Utatane Piko, Nekomura Iroha, Gachapoid (\"Ryuto\") Vocaloid 3 - SeeU, Mew, Tone Rion, Oliver, CUL, Yuzuki Yukari, Bruno, Clara, IA, Aoki Lapis, Luo Tianyi, Galaco, Mayu, Avanna, ZOLA Project (Yuu, Wil, and Kyo), Yan He, Yohioloid, Maika, Merli, Macne Nana (originally for the macne software, but she got a Vocaloid bank), Kokone, Anon and Kanon, v Flower, Tohoku Zunko, Rana, Chika, Xin Hua, Yuezheng Ling Vocaloid 4 - Cyber Diva (VY3), Sachiko, Arsloid, Ruby, Dex, Daina, Fukase Note: Because \"append\" was the first term ever used, for characters for which different tones of voices (e.g. whisper, sweet) were included in their updates, I'm calling them \"append voices\". Vocaloid 2 updates: Miku - append voices Rin and Len - append voices Vocaloid 3 updates: Meiko V3 - append voices and English Kaito V3 - append voices and English Miku V3 - English Megpoid V3 - append voices and English Gackpoid V3 - append voices Lily V3 - re-recorded voice (sounds very different to her V2). VY1V3 VY2V3 - falsetto voice Galaco Red and Blue - append voice IA Rocks - append voice Gachapoid V3 Vocaloid 4 updates: VY1V4 - append voices Yuzuki Yukari V4 - append voices  Luka V4X - append voice, voice colors (E.V.E.C.) Gackpoid V4 - growl only SF-A2 Miki V4 - growl only, re-recorded bank Nekomura Iroha V4 - append voice V4 flower - growl only Kaai Yuki V4 - growl only Hiyama Kiyoteru V4 - append voice Gumi V4 - append voices (imo, SoftWhisper sounds exactly like Iroha Soft :P) Rana V4 - growl only ",
