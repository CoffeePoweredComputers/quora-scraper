            "answer_text": "Two years ago, for the first time I paid her attention. Her new album 25 was just being released. Then I followed her massive worldwide tournament through social media and Adele fandom there. Some nights it felt like I was in the venue, right there. I listened to her modest and funny banter through Periscope. I was in awe of her aura as a star and her connection with the crowd. Through Periscope, I shared with many fans the sentiment of following the gigs of one of the biggest divas of today. The word \u201cdiva\u201d is used for those who have massive fanbase and record sales, right? I don\u2019t want to overhype the situation but, then, she is a diva. And I thank her for inspiring me through her successful career as a music diva.  So what makes this answer different? I said similar things in some other answers too, actually I wrote 34 other Adele-inspired answers. The food for thought of this answer is Adele\u2019s childhood as the only-child born to a single mum and an alcoholic father and its impact on her career. I think everything connects to her childhood, we owe her hit songs to Adele\u2019s lonely childhood days in which mostly only her mother was present. Do we need another explanation for years of such heart-wrenching songs from her solely written for the guys who left her? Adele\u2019s own father was the first person who had left her by leaving the family when she was just 3. Being alone for years as a single mum also made Adele\u2019s mum Penny a strong, independent woman who takes care of her family on her own. Adele\u2019s mum\u2019s work ethics affected Adele\u2019s view of her career too. Being alone as a child and not having any siblings also affected Adele\u2019s strong perception of herself and fostered her independence in everything she does. As a result, today she is the only boss of her music career. And she is one of the most selling artists, certainly being in Top 3. So this independent child raised in the bosom of her 19-year-old mother, this playful child who used to imitate Spice Girls to her mum and her friends\u2026  She is no longer that child. She is the Adele now. And everyone knows that it\u2019s her, when you say the name Adele.  So, this success and work ethics, passion that brought her to this level at her career is really unbelievable. Even when the day comes and I get bored of her music, this talent and determination of hers won\u2019t cease to inspire me career wise. And this is one of the biggest aspects from which she inspires me. This is what I think about Adele. She is a successful musician and we should track down her past in order to understand her career. My strong opinion is that Adele Laurie\u2019s lonely days as a child is what gave us today\u2019s popstar Adele. So let's go down memory lane if you will. Let's track down the road to Adele\u2019s success. Shall we?  Imagine yourself, you are an only-child and you have no siblings to play with. Your mom is working her a** off to provide things for you in every aspect. You live in Tottenham in Northern London, an area where gangs are present and poverty and underage pregnant girls are reality. And you have this music passion coming from your father's interest in Blues, you are named Adele Laurie Blues for that reason. Then you learn singing by listening to Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald records and imitating them. Probably records your absent father also liked to listen to, and he is still there. He is not completely absent but after a few years, you rarely see him. Then you go to BRITS Art School. At 17 or something, you are discovered through Myspace and XL Recordings sign a deal with you. Then you have your first album named 19 because it is consisted of the songs you wrote at the age 19. It has been successful and you are getting to the fame already. With your second album 21, your fame explodes, you are even being known as Adele in far lands now with Rolling In The Deep and Someone Like You. After taking a break from 21 Era and forming a family, you make a comeback in 20th of November, 2015. You realize you are even bigger than before. And everyone refers to you as the voice of a generation. An artist that fills the stage up with her presence like old stars. An artist true to herself and fans. You have more than ten Grammys now with your three albums. So this is the success story of Adele Laurie Blue Adkins. From lonely childhood days, from no fans to millions of fans, she rose to success. Therefore her success story can be explained with one short sentence, as she wrote in one of her Instagram posts, \u201cStarted from the bottom, now we are here.\u201d And what can we learn from Adele\u2019s success? Believing in yourself, creating your own way of doing your art, not following the crowd, and passion for what you do brings success. Being humble, being sincere in all you do is also important. And this is why I like reading about Adele Adkins\u2019s extraordinary life and this is the reason I\u2019ll always follow Adele as an artist eventhough her genre doesn\u2019t 100 per cent match with my taste in music. I\u2019ll follow her just because she is a great example of success. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not particularly into her music. I acknowledge her gorgeous face, and that she is wildly successful in her field. She is like \u201cSezen Aksu\u201d of the whole music world, when Sezen Aksu is a powerhouse in a more local, Turkish sense. I wasn\u2019t among those that went nuts when Adele broke her silence with Hello. I guess my favorite couple of songs of hers and that she covered were Set Fire to the Rain and Make You Feel My Love. But none of them are things I ever feel like getting back to listening to. I am more of an EDM and pop-rock lover. Adele\u2019s music is way too deppressing for me. But as a female, for not that legitimate of a reason other than that I guess, I love the strong and uber successful profile she has. I like the image she has. But her music, not my taste. ",
