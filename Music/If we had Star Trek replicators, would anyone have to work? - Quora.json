            "answer_text": "\u201cIf we had Star Trek replicators, would anyone have to work?\u201d This is, at root, an economic question. Think of an economy as an ecology. In both, access to (and the abundance of) key resources determines survival and the ability to grow and reproduce. An apex predator basically lives in a replicator-filled, resource-rich world. The only work it has to do is chase down meals and deal with its own species for hunting and mating privileges. It does not have to do anything to maintain the system that sustains it. That\u2019s because that system is self-maintaining. Everything in it repairs and replicates itself. It is all powered by an external source that is extremely unlikely to fail for a very, very long time. If anything goes wrong with that system that decreases the resources the predator needs, the predator is doomed- look at what happened to T. Rex and similar apex predators before humans came along. Meteor strikes, volcanic eruptions, ice ages and for that matter the Great Oxygenation Event were system disruptions no species was in a position to deal with successfully. In all cases the large, previously successful predators went extinct and the small previously-prey species survived and flourished in the complete absence of predators. Humans invented technology to make it possible for us to survive in environments we did not evolve in- to be able to take advantage of resources that otherwise might as well not be there for humans without any technology. We are also far more than simple eat-reproduce-die elements of the ecologies we inhabit. Like many other species we modify our environment, we\u2019re just way better at it than any other species. Remove our technology and we would suffer major population losses, surviving in isolated pockets where the climate isn\u2019t too harsh for us, and where the remaining food sources are sufficient for us. Take away even fire and stone-age tech and we\u2019re no longer an apex predator. Where\u2019s the parallel to replicator technology? In the maintenance. Unless replicators are self-repairing (and self-powering, per your notes in the comment appended to your question) there will have to be someone to maintain, repair, and \u201cfeed\u201d the replicators. Depending on the social situation preceding the availability of such technology, they will either be an overclass that determines who gets to have and use a replicator, or an underclass considered beneath those who do no work. The only way out of that dilemma is education and real Social Justice- let nobody become too ignorant to manage their own replicator, and hold no one up, or down, for being able to do so. The way our First World societies are going right now I would predict a combination of the worst of the above two options- an overclass that commands the actual workers, using that to control the great mass of the population. Far too many \u201cordinary people\u201d consider it beneath them to know how to do things that involve getting their hands dirty. Far too many people hold those who don\u2019t mind that kind of work in contempt. We\u2019re not ready for replicators yet. ",

            "answer_text": "A replicator, assuming energy is free, would eliminate all manufacturing industry and agriculture jobs, but there would still be service-type jobs that you can't use a replicator for - ranging from policemen, doctors, replicator technicians, stuff like that. On the short term, it would seriously screw up the economy.  We'd end up with a lot of food and goods that were super-cheap, and suddenly the only things worth anything would be service jobs, people might flock into the services sector, causing an oversupply of (basic) service workers, leading to a situation where all the basic services are worthless, and only the highly specialized service jobs like doctors, and replicator technicians with disproportionately highly paid jobs. On the long term, things should even out, and then human society can go in one (or both) of two directions:1. Go on living off replicated food and medicines, with people becomming lazy because: \"hey, we've got everything we need out of the replicator, why bother working anyway\", and spend all day pleasure-seeking and tripping out on replicated mind-altering substances.  Eventually these people become illiterate degenerates, who do nothing but feed and seek pleasure.2. OR, humans can go spend all the free time seeking advances in science, art, and culture.Perhaps society might even stratify, with one under-caste of pleasure-seeking degenerates living in squalor, and another caste of advanced scientists and artists who shut out the degenerates from their gleaming white cities and continuing to build their knowledge, perhaps one day escaping the earth and into space in great big ark-ships to explore the galaxy and the universe, leaving behind the degenerates to overrun the earth.  With no-one left to maintain the replicators, and not enough social skills to help each-other out, the degenerates, who by this time have super-extended lifespans thanks to being used as guinea pigs by the scientifict overcaste who were seeking genetically compatible test subjects in their own life-span extending experimentation, grow to resent the scientific overcaste.  Eventually the degenerates, denied of their replicators, learn the secrets of spaceflight from secrets found within the now-ruins of the once-gleaming white cities.  They build their own space-ships, and then fueled by their savage nature and burning resentment for the overcaste, which with every generation grows with more hate and rage, the go on a galaxy-wide rampage to destroy the overcaste. Somewhere with all that is an orphaned degenerate boy who was found and adopted by overcaste parents (by this time overcastes had lost the ability to biologically reproduce, leading to an ongoing crisis amongst their sub-race).  Who upon discovered his true birth that the parents tried to hide from him is first filled with rage, but is then determined to prove that he, rather than his heritage, is in control of his destiny.  There is also a love interest involved, whose unfortunate death at the hands of raiding degenerates.  The orphan, now a young adult ultimately takes her death as the fault of his savage nature.  This crippling guilt causes doubt in the resolve of the orphan, who struggles to come to terms with his loss.  Eventually however he discovers a way to turn his loss into his strength to help him continue his journey of proving his destiny, which just happens to be wound up in the growing crisis of degenerate raiders faced by the overcaste.  Over several heart-pounding nail-biting adventures, and perhaps another love interest or two along the way, the orphan eventually works his way, through luck and through his tenacity, and through the help of a mysterious third party who remains tantalizingly unexplained, to a position where the death or survival of this faction of degenerate raiders is in his hands (though the fate of the larger community of degenerates remains unstated, leaving open the way for sequels).  In this final moment, to the disbelief of onlooking overcaste leaders, the orphan, declines to commit genocide, and instead declares that the degenerates be treated with forgiveness.  And in this moment, the mysterious third party is revealed to the orphan as a faction of halfcastes, lead by none other than his biological parents.  In this final twist we learn that the halfcastes are an outcast group who are xenephobically persecuted by overcastes, were founded by his grandparents, who were a research subject now-reform-degenerate, and the overcaste researcher working on the longevity programme who fell for him.  The half-castes had none of the savegary of the degenerates, and retained the ability to reproduce.   In that moment of forgiveness, the orphan, has proven to the overcastes as unwitting representative of the halfcastes, that his blood-line deserves recognition and that the overcastes were wrong to be xenophobic.  So in the end, the orphan who set out to prove that he was in control of his destiny got that wish, and also took into his hands and saved the destiny of not only his people (from persecution of the xenophobic overcaste), but also that of the overcaste (who were able to rengineer their ability to reproduce by studying the halfcaste), and the degenerates (who sulk for a while but upon realizing this discovery of unexpected forgiveness, and this appearence of their heroic half-kin are able to shed their generational rage and live as equals alongside the overcaste and halfcaste).  Some will say the moral of the story is that as humans, we risk succumbing to our base instincts, but if we maintain the good discipline and morality that we are taught as children throughout our lives, we can succeed as people, and as a race. So there we go, that's exactly what will happen if we have replicators.  Nasty stuff, but would make for a good epic SciFi saga. ",
