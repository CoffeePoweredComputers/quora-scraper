            "answer_text": "I do not believe Linkin Park will replace Chester. I honestly don\u2019t really expect them to make a ton more music, because while all those guys are really talented, without Chester they lose their rock side. They have the Hip-Hop still with Mike Shinoda, and Mike can sing decent rock verses too, but Chester\u2019s voice was the dynamic one people always wanted to hear. Maybe Linkin Park does one or two more albums MAYBE but if they do I would bet it\u2019s solo Mike Shinoda on vocals, maybe they add some features to fill in the gaps. The thing is, when I think of possible replacements and people who can do Chester justice, I only really think of one name and that is Corey Taylor. The problem is, Corey Taylor is the lead singer of Slipknot, and I doubt he would give that up to join Linkin Park. And I don\u2019t believe there is enough time for him to manage both. We saw it with Chester, when he tried to lead sing for Linkin Park and Stone Temple Pilots. It just didn\u2019t work out because it\u2019s too hard to be the lead guy for two bands at the same time. That, and other obstacles will pop up along the way. I\u2019m sure there are other people who could replace Chester theoretically, but I think Linkin Park fans (myself included) loved Chester\u2019s voice so much that hearing pretty much any other person singing would just feel wrong. The one thing I think that would be cool is to get a female vocalist, like Lizzy Hale (not her specifically but someone like her) because that would allow them to keep their sound, without having a singer that\u2019s sounds like knockoff Chester Bennington. But even that, I don\u2019t see as too likely. To end it, I think the band will either stop making music or will make one or two more albums with just Mike and random features on vocals. I do not see a replacement scenario playing out. I think Chester was too beloved by those guys to be replaced. But you never know, it\u2019s a business. Things can change. ",

            "answer_text": "The next vocalist of LP? Well.. not to be a Debbie Downer, there undoubtedly won\u2019t be another vocalist for Linkin Park. You cannot replace people. Especially someone like Chester, who is a rock legend and was the heart of Linkin Park. He truly was an amazing person and talented singer. I find it so repulsive that people think that he could simply be \u201creplaced.\u201d Its like saying, \u201coh? your brother died? Well why don't you just get a new one.\u201d That is fucked up. You cannot replace people, let alone any other living thing. Once they're gone, it\u2019s forever. All that is left is your memories of the time you spent together. Also I can't think of any other singer that can sing in almost any genre of music and have it sound so mesmerizing and beautiful. No one has ever had his sound and I doubt there will ever be another who can come close to sounding the same. Plus no one out there does Chester's type of singing; scranging = screaming + singing. Yeah there are screamers and singers out there.. But can they hold a tune and scream and sing at the same time? Can they go from a hard metal scream then hit high tenor notes within the same breath? Nope. :\\ I say enjoy and cherish the music Linkin Park has already made. Don't forget about Linkin Park's underground albums, the songs that didn't make the final cut with WB. And the stuff they did as a band on the side where they sing about funny everyday stuff like, \u201ci don't wanna do no fucking laundry.\u201d It's cute and so funny. You can find links about it at LinkinPedia.com . Yep, Linkin Pedia is a real thing. Make sure to check out Mike's new album - Post Traumatic. It is amazing and worth the buy. And always support those in your life struggling with depression in any way you can. Be there for them, tell them that your life would be empty if they were not in it. ",
