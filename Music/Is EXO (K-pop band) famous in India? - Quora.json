            "answer_text": "EXO is very very very famous in India! We have an official fanbase in Twitter, Facebook and Instagram with more than 5k followers. A few fans have also attended their concert in Singapore. Indian Exo-Ls have also organised many projects [Group Album Order, Gifts and Letter Album from Indian Exo-Ls to EXO, Letters for Chanyeol's mom, and Kurta and gifts for Kai, donation and charity work on EXO's and EXO-Ls Anniversaries, food truck for Korean Eris etc.] Indian Exo-L banner showing our support was put up in Kcon Australia for Chen's birthday. There is also an online magazine Indian Exo-Ls released called ChogiTimes. It has messages and interesting stuff and is published on each member's birthday. Indian Exo-L fanbase is huuuge. There are a lot of regional WhatsApp groups and 6 unnies have taken the initiative to gather all Indian fans together and contribute for various projects. :) ",
