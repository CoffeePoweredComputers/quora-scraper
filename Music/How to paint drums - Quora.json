            "answer_text": "Are you trying to paint drums, as in percussion instruments? I strongly suggest that you DO NOT try it. If the drums are of low quality then they will have been covered in some type of laminate such as formica. For all intents and purposes this stuff cannot be painted successfully and if it is painted will not survive very long. The effort and cost of materials used to do the job at home, by an amateur will have been wasted. If it is a decent drum set then refinishing is possible but it\u2019ll easily cost as much as painting a car. They\u2019ll have to be completely disassembled (NOT just masked off), prepared properly by a clinically rigorous process, then primered with the proper stuff that is compatible with the old finish and the new stuff, then painted and clear coated using a catalyzed finish. No, there is no such thing as spray cans with catalyzed paint in them. Most people that do drum refinishing will insist on stripping the old finish completely off first, often something that is very challenging all by itself since it should not be sanded off or risk damaging the shell. Sooo, again, if the drums are cheap, live with it. If the drums are decent, have it professionally done and know that it will cost many hundreds of dollars. If the drums are premium quality or if they might have some value due to their age DON\u201dT TOUCH THEM. ",

            "answer_text": "As Paul put it, \u201cas in percussion instruments?\u201d If that is so, then you have two kinds of drums, cheap and expensive. Cheap drums, uninstall your hardware, then you can just peel off the wrap (carefully, or you may strip off the shell and you won\u2019t have something to call a drum anymore), and sand the drum carefully (again, so the drum doesn\u2019t unravel), tape off the holes, then start painting. Unless you\u2019re good with brushing on paint, spray paint will be better. If you\u2019re working on expensive drums, have it done by professionals. Don\u2019t attempt to even repaint or refinish it. Now, if this is a drum like a container, then go crazy, spray paint and regular house paint will do fine. ",
